          "description":"You can grow just about any low-maintenance plant in a terrarium, but you\u2019ll need to choose plants that will grow well together. Get a selection of plants that grow in similar conditions in the wild, such as woodland, desert, or tropical plants. For instance, if you choose a woodland theme, you might grow moss, foam flowers, and hepatica. Many of these plants do best in cool, shady conditions. Desert plants, such as cacti and other succulents, do best with brighter light and low humidity levels. Tropical plants, like Tahitian bridal veil and Venus fly traps, like warm and humid conditions."

          "headline":"Pick plants that stay small.",
          "description":"Plants that grow really wide or tall aren\u2019t the best options for terrarium gardens. Instead, stick to small, low-growing plants, or those that can be easily pruned down to a manageable size. For example, starfish plants are ideal for terrariums since they only grow to be about 6 inches (15 cm) tall when they\u2019re fully mature. Some terrarium plants, like club moss, like to spread horizontally. You may need to trim them back to keep them from taking over the entire terrarium. Others, like the false aralia, need to be pruned to prevent them from getting too tall."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Opt for an open glass container for low-moisture plants.",
          "description":"You can use just about any kind of glass container for a terrarium, from a fish tank to an old-fashioned glass bottle. However, if you\u2019re growing plants that like dry conditions, such as succulents, you\u2019ll need a container that doesn\u2019t retain too much moisture. Choose an open container with relatively low sides for these kinds of plants. For example, a fish tank or an old punch bowl could make a great terrarium for some haworthia, hens and chicks, and mini-cacti. Avoid growing succulents or cacti in containers with tall or curved walls, since these retain more humidity and don\u2019t promote good air flow."

          "description":"Tropical and woodland plants typically enjoy plenty of moisture, so they do best in more closed-off environments. If you have plants that need humidity, try using a container such as a jar, a vase with a broad bottom, or a Wardian case (which looks like a tiny greenhouse). Some plants that do well in more enclosed containers include ferns, begonias, mosses, and ivies. You can even create a fully closed-off environment by growing your plants under a glass cloche or inside a bottle."

Wait for the container to dry completely before you begin adding your growing media and plants. Even if the container was never used before, it\u2019s still a good idea to wash it before planting in it.

While the amount you need to put in will vary depending on the size of your terrarium, a layer about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) deep is usually sufficient. You can buy gravel or pebbles at gardening centers or pet supply stores. You could also use crushed pottery, rock chips, or even glass marbles for your drainage layer. This drainage layer is necessary to prevent the soil from becoming soggy in your terrarium, which can lead to problems with mold, bacteria, and root rot."

          "headline":"Pour in a layer of activated charcoal.",
          "description":"Activated charcoal acts as a filter in your terrarium, removing toxic chemicals from the water and soil. Put a layer about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) deep on top of your drainage material. The charcoal is most effective if it sits on top of the drainage layer. However, if you\u2019re working with a very small container, you can also mix the charcoal into the drainage material. You can purchase activated charcoal from a pet or garden supply store."

Place the moss on top of the layer of charcoal to prevent soil from filtering down into the drainage layer. Keep the layer of moss thin. You only need enough to completely cover the charcoal layer. You can purchase sheet moss or sphagnum moss at a pet store or home and garden supply center."

It\u2019s helpful to dampen the soil slightly first to reduce dust. Make it moist, but not muddy. The amount of soil you\u2019ll need will vary depending on the size of your terrarium, but you\u2019ll probably need to add a layer at least 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) deep to accommodate the roots of your plants. Ideally, all the material you\u2019ve added so far should take up about \u00bc of the depth of the container. If your container has a narrow opening, use a large funnel to pour in the soil."

          "description":"Use your finger or a tool (such as a chopstick) to make shallow holes in the soil. Remove a plant from its container and tease the roots gently apart to remove excess soil. Nestle it carefully into a hole and add more soil around it, patting it down gently. Repeat with the rest of the plants. Before adding any plants, trim off any dead foliage. It\u2019s also a good idea to treat them with a gentle pesticide, such as neem oil or dilute dish soap, to get rid of any hidden bugs or other pests. Make sure to leave 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) between the plants if possible so that there\u2019s plenty of room for air flow between them. Trim the leaves so that they don\u2019t touch the edges of the terrarium or the other plants, if necessary."

You can also add moss or pebbles between the plants to make it look a little neater. Get imaginative with the decorations if you want. For example, you could add some pretty crystals to create a fairy garden look, or add some sand and seashells for a beach theme."

Research the needs of your plants and put the terrarium in a spot where they\u2019ll get the kind of light and temperature conditions they require.Warning: Avoid putting a closed or tall-sided terrarium in direct sunlight, since the glass will trap heat and even magnify the sunlight. This can easily cause your plants to overheat or get singed. For example, if you\u2019re growing succulents in a shallow dish, put your terrarium in a sunny window so they can get plenty of light throughout the day. Ferns will probably do better in an area where they get filtered light (such as near a window with gauzy curtains over it). Avoid keeping your terrarium in a spot where it will be exposed to temperature extremes or temperature fluctuations, such as near a heater, air conditioner, or drafty doorway.
