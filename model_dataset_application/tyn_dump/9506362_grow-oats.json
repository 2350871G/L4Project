To start off on the right foot, test the soil with a commercial pH probe or a pH test strip in the area where you plan to plant your oat seeds. If the pH doesn\u2019t fall between 6 and 7, try a different location or adjust the pH. You can raise the pH by adding limestone to the soil. You can lower the pH by adding a fertilizer that contains ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or urea to the soil."

Before planting your oat seeds, use a weeding tool to loosen the soil around the weeds in the area and then pull the weeds out of the ground one by one.

When you\u2019re done, push the tiller in lines that are perpendicular to the others. If you don\u2019t have a tiller, you can rent one from a home improvement store or from a lawn and garden equipment rental store or website."
