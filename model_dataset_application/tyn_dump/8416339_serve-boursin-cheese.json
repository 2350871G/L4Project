  "text":" Offering Boursin as a Cheese Platter Offer Boursin as a spread. Boursin cheese is soft and creamy, so don\u2019t expect to serve it as you would with, say, hard cheddar, which you can cut into firm cubes and serve with toothpicks for handholds. Provide a knife or spoon so guests can spread it on other snacks. Also be sure that you transfer it, if needed, to a hard serving plate or bowl if it\u2019s wrapped in foil, since a knife could potentially slice the foil. Pair Boursin with a simple platter. Stick with the classic platter snacks if you\u2019re a traditionalist. Arrange slices of bread and/or assorted crackers around your cheese. If fruits and vegetables are more your thing, do the same with them, or offer both. However, if you do both, keep the fruits and veggies separated from the bread and crackers, since the moisture from one could soften the other. Offer less standard snacks, too. Boursin is very versatile when it comes to being paired with other foods. Surprise your guests with more than the same-old same-old. Instead of (or in addition to) the crackers and veggies, consider offering dry cured meats, olives, jam, honey, and/or chocolate. Making Mac and Cheese Cupcakes Cook the pasta. First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Then read the cooking directions for your particular brand of elbow pasta. Pour the recommended amount of water into a large pot to cook 12 ounces (340 g) and turn the burner\u2019s heat to high. Once the water comes to a boil, add the pasta. Cook for about a minute less than the directions advise for al dente. Then transfer the pasta to a strainer in the sink and drain the water. Create the bottom crust for your cupcakes. First, melt one stick of unsalted butter in your microwave or a small pot on the stovetop. While that melts, empty 2.5 sleeves of Ritz crackers into a large mixing bowl. Use your hands to crumble them into small chunks. Then add \u00be cup (84.75 g) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and then the melted butter. Stir until they are evenly mixed. Add the bottom crust to your liners. First, divide 24 paper muffin liners between two standard-size muffin tins (with each one holding 12 liners). Then coat the inside of the liners with non-stick cooking spray so they peel easily from your finished cupcakes. Split the mixture for the bottom crust between the liners as evenly as possible. Use the bottom of a small glass or similar hard, circular object to flatten the mixture into a compact bottom for your cupcakes. Prep your mac and cheese. In a second large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta with 3.25 cups (367.25 g) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, plus 5.2 ounces (147.5 g) of Boursin garlic-herb cheese and 2 tablespoons of cold unsalted butter. Then, in a third mixing bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs, \u00be cup (177.5 ml) of whole milk, and \u00bc cup of sour cream (57.5 g). Once mixed, pour the liquid ingredients into the pasta bowl, add \u00bc teaspoon of salt and \u215b teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and gently stir to combine. Bake your cupcakes.
