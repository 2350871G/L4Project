However, if you want to give the compress a pleasant fragrance, you\u2019ll also need a little bit of powdered peppermint, cinnamon, or whichever aroma you\u2019d prefer. You can use some herbs from your kitchen, the contents of an herbal tea bag or essential oils. Try adding relaxing lavender, chamomile, sage, or mint to your compress for an even more soothing experience."

Just leave enough sock material on the end to tie a knot, unless you plan on sewing the end of the sock to make a permanent warm compress. Then you can fill it nearly to the top.

Tying a firm knot into the sock will keep the contents in place for a short period of time, but let you reuse the sock later. You can also sew the open end of the sock together for a more permanent compress. Note that sealing the sock very close to its contents will make for a hard compress, while sealing it far away will leave its contents loose. Experiment a little bit with how hard or soft you want the compress to feel before sealing it. If you leave the contents a little looser, you can drape the sock easily over your neck and shoulders to treat pain there."

          "description":"After you have sealed your compress, microwave it for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds you can feel it and see how warm it is. If you are happy with the level of warmth, you can take it out and use it. If you want it to be warmer, continue microwaving the compress in increments of 10 seconds until the compress is as warm as you\u2019d like it to be. Remember that placing scalding hot materials against your skin can cause blisters and burns. A range between about 70 and 80\u00b0F (21.1 to 26.7\u00b0C) is optimal."

After allowing your skin to cool down, you can reapply it for another ten minutes if you wish.
