          "description":"Before you start polishing granite, it needs to be free of spills and stains. Fill up a bucket or a sink with warm water. Add a few drops of mild soap like dish detergent and agitate the water to make it bubbly. Although warm, soapy water is very effective, you can also purchase specialty granite cleaners for everyday cleaning if you prefer. As another option, you can use a 50/50 solution of isopropyl alcohol and warm water in place of soap and other cleansers. Never use harsh chemicals on granite. Although granite is a hard-wearing material, it needs to be treated gently to keep it looking good. Avoid products that contain lemon, vinegar, lime, ammonia, bleach, or glass cleaners, as these chemicals can break down the sealant and damage the granite over time."
