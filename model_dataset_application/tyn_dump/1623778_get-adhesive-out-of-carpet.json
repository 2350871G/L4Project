Leave the vinegar on the spot for at least 15 minutes. You can also use equal parts water and vinegar if you prefer. However, you may need to leave the mixture on overnight. The vinegar should cause the adhesive to start peeling off fairly quickly and easily. Use a wet cloth to remove any adhesive and let the area sit to dry. Be sure to use only distilled, white vinegar and test a small area before using the solution on larger areas."

Gently scrub the spot, but be careful not to apply too much pressure, as you don\u2019t want the glue to get pushed deeper into the carpet. Pat the spot dry with another cloth and let it sit."

Let it set on the carpet for 15 minutes. Then, scrape the carpet again to remove as much of the adhesive as possible. Finally, apply a carpet cleaner, such as Goo Gone to finish the clean-up.Be sure to test the WD-40 on an inconspicuous place on your carpet before you apply it to a visible area. For example, test it on a spot behind your sofa. Make sure it doesn't stain or damage your carpet. Don't leave the WD-40 on your carpet for longer than 15-30 minutes. If you do, it will weaken the glue that holds your carpet down."

Once the iron has reached the proper temperature, simply iron over the cloth for approximately 10 seconds. Pull the paper towel and cloth back. The adhesive should have been transferred to the paper towel. Use caution when working with a hot iron. Make sure you test a small area before moving on to a larger one.
