          "description":"The basic thali to look for is a dinner-plate style which comes with a plain, raised 1 in (2.5 cm) lip around the edge. Look for one that comes in a bright and interesting color. They can range from 6 in (15 cm) to large platters of 13 inches (33 cm) or more, so choose the size that will work best for you. Brick-and-mortar craft stores and online stores are excellent places to look for a plain thali. There are also thalis with decorative inlays around the edge or even scalloped edges."

          "description":"Because a thali is basically a decorated, round platter, you can make an inexpensive base for your decoration out of cardboard. Trace a circle onto a large, flat, blemish-free piece of cardboard. Next, cut out the circle using scissors or a utility knife. Add an additional design to the edge like scalloping or waves for a more elaborate base."

Thalis are generally decorated with a symmetrical design, with elements adorning both the lip and center of the plate."

Make sure you consider how you will decorate the lip of the plate as well. If you\u2019re new to decorating a thali, sketching your idea out first will help you avoid mistakes. Consider leaving an open space in the very middle of your thali where you can place a small diya (a traditional Indian oil lamp) or a votive candle. Some thali designs are geometric patterns, while others may incorporate more fluid design elements (like a peacock, for example)."

Trace along the bottom of the thali to create the outline of a circle that roughly matches in the inside of the tray. Cut out the circle with scissors. You may have purchased a thali that is already colorful. In this case, consider leaving the bottom uncovered. Another alternative to paper and fabric is paint."

Use a glue gun to make a ring of melted glue along the inside of the thali, at the bottom of the lip. Place your fabric circle in the bottom, decorative side up. If the fabric is a bit larger or smaller than the bottom, that\u2019s ok! Push the extra up onto the sides of the thali if it is a bit too big.

Fold the tape over the edge of the plate and smooth it down along the outside rim. Repeat this, spacing the tape evenly around the lip. Look for printed duct tape in craft stores or online.

Some thalis are almost entirely covered in adornments, while others are presented more simply with just a few well-placed gems. A simple example is to create lines of gems from the outside of the thali towards the center, like the rays of the sun.
