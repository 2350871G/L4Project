          "description":"Let a breeze blow through your room if the weather conditions in your area allow it. Bring some small fans into your room, if possible, to get the air flowing. Circulating fresh air in your room helps eliminate unpleasant odors, whether they are from the things in your room or the cleaning supplies you use. The fans in your room might be covered in dust. Try to find a portable fan from another room. Clean it off first. If you don\u2019t have any other options, you can turn on the fans in your room, but turn them off again while you dust."

          "description":"Carry at least 1 garbage bag so you don\u2019t have to walk far to throw things out. Collect anything you need to get rid of, including wrappers, containers, and other junk. Garbage bags are also useful for disposing of dust and paper towels while cleaning. You can use garbage bags as storage containers for clothing or items you wish to donate. If you do this, set the bags aside so you don\u2019t mistake them for garbage."

          "headline":"Set a laundry basket in the bedroom to hold clothing.",
          "description":"A laundry basket or bin is a must for dirty clothing. If you have a small basket, you can carry it with you while you work. Otherwise, leave it by the door and toss dirty clothes into it. Laundry baskets are very useful for keeping clothing off the floor and furniture. Try to keep a basket in your room at all times to limit the amount of clutter. Bring in extra baskets to help you sort more clutter. For example, use a second basket to hold clean clothes or items that don\u2019t belong in your room."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Remove trash cluttering the room.",
          "description":"Trash like old wrappers, bags, and bottles are the easiest problem to spot and remove. You know you will get rid of these items, so you can drop them into a trash bag to make your room look cleaner almost immediately. Carry a trash bag with you to make this quicker. If you have plates or glasses in your room, take those out as well. Clean them off and return them to the kitchen."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Collect clothing scattered around the room.",
          "description":"Start off with clothes on the floor to give yourself more room to maneuver. If you\u2019re unsure how to begin, work your way around the room. Once you have the floor done, take care of clothes draped over the furniture. You don\u2019t have to sort through the clothes right away, but try to separate them into clean and wash piles. Doing this now saves you a little bit of hassle later."

Store clean clothes, move personal items into drawers and so on until your room looks neat. Keep items from other rooms in a separate storage container, then return them to their proper place once you\u2019re done with the bedroom."

Fold and hang clothing to make closets and wardrobes look orderly. Also, rearrange items on top of furniture to eliminate clutter. For example, bring in plastic storage bins to hold clothes that are out of season. Remove anything you no longer wear. Try rearranging furniture to give a dull bedroom a fresh look!"

Most of the dust will be in the crevasses where the walls and ceiling meet. Drag the duster along the ceiling to eliminate the dust. Microfiber cloths and dusters attract dust instead of dispersing it. They make cleaning a bedroom much easier. Look out for spiders trying to take over ceiling corners. Remove webs with a duster or broom."

Set up a stepladder or use an extended duster to reach room fixtures. Shake out the dust outdoors or inside a trash bag. If you are able to reach lights and fans, wipe them down with a moist cloth or paper towel and an all-purpose cleaner to remove the remaining debris. The top surfaces of fans accumulate plenty of dust. When you use a fan, its blades throw all that dust around your room, leaving you with more of a mess to tackle. Follow the same process for any plug-in fans in your room. Unplug them first to protect your fingers."

Use a vacuum with a hose attachment to clear tough to reach areas. A brush attachment works well for curtains. Most curtains can be machine washed. Take the curtains down and put them through a low-spin cycle with cold water. Consider taking delicate curtains to a dry cleaning service to avoid damaging them. Curtains and blinds get pretty dusty if you aren\u2019t used to cleaning them regularly. Wear a dust mask to help you get through the work."

Go along the baseboards with a microfiber cloth or duster, paying particular attention to your room\u2019s corners. Once the baseboards look dust-free, scrub out remaining stains with a cloth dampened in warm water. Wash off the baseboards after you finish the ceiling.

Don\u2019t forget to wash off picture frames and TV screens. Many glass surfaces are small and easy to overlook, but cleaning them makes your room look so much better."

If you miss that fresh smell your mattress had when it was new, leave it uncovered for at least 3 hours. To help air out your mattress, open your blinds and windows. Move the mattress so it receives as much sunlight and fresh air as possible. If you\u2019re in once-a-year spring cleaning mode, consider getting a helper to carry the mattress outdoor for some sunshine.

If you need to give the floor a deeper cleaning, get a liquid cleaner matching the type of floor you have. It's best to vacuum your hard floors with a soft brush attachment before you mop. The vacuum cleaner will quickly and easily remove any dirt or debris, instead of pushing it around like a mop can. For example, mix a few drops of liquid dish soap in a bucket of warm water. Use the soapy water to scrub tile or polyurethane wood floors. For wood floors sealed with shellac or varnish, get a wood floor cleaner or polish. Use a wax mop to scrub the floor in the direction of the wood\u2019s grain."

If you don\u2019t, spray a spritz of room spray or plug in an air freshener. Sweet-smelling herbs, incense, or candles also help put the finishing touches on your beautiful bedroom. Remember that items like air fresheners cover up old smells rather than eliminate them. Musty smells from water and mildew, for example, need to be treated separately with thorough cleaning. Be careful when lighting candles or other fragrances. Don\u2019t leave anything burning unattended, and make sure the scent is acceptable to anyone else you live with."
