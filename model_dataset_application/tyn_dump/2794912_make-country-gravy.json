          "description":"Melt 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of butter in a small to medium saucepan over medium heat. Let the butter melt completely before moving on to the next step, but try to avoid letting it boil or steam. You could also use a large skillet to make country gravy instead of a saucepan. If you were cooking meat in your skillet before you started cooking the gravy, you can use the leftover pan drippings from the cooked meat instead of or alongside the butter. Reduce the amount of butter so that the butter and pan drippings combined equal no more than about 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of fat. Vegetable oil can also be used instead of butter, but it is a little less traditional."

The flour, salt, and pepper are necessary. The flour and butter combine to form a thickening agent known as a \"roux,\" which is a vital component of the gravy. The salt and pepper are basic seasonings needed in order to provide the gravy with country-style flavor. The paprika and garlic salt are optional, however, and many basic country gravy recipes do not include them. The spices add a hint of extra flavor to the gravy without being too overpowering."

Adding too much milk at once will make it almost impossible to break down the lumps and create a smooth gravy. Only add about 1/4 cup (60 mL) at a time. Start with roughly 1 cup (250 mL) of milk.
