If you like your mashed potatoes with the skins in it, you don\u2019t have to peel them. Simply give them a good rinse to dislodge any dirt. For the fluffiest mashed potatoes, use russet or yukon gold.

Start by cutting them into quarters, and from there cut each quarter into 4-6 equal pieces. Set them aside in the pot you plan on using to cook them. If you\u2019re in a hurry, you could just cut each potato in half once\u2014but it may take you a little longer to mash them all together later, or it may take them longer to boil through."

Be careful when testing the potatoes\u2014use oven mitts if you\u2019re grabbing the handles and watch out for steam. If you notice any foam collecting at the top of the water, use a large spoon to skim it off periodically. If you can\u2019t boil your potatoes, you could also microwave them. Place your peeled and cut potatoes into a microwave-safe bowl, cover the dish, and microwave them for 3-4 minutes. Test them with a fork to see if they\u2019re soft enough or if they need more time.
