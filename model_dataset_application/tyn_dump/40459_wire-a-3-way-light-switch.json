Use a voltage detector to ensure that you're not going to shock yourself once you start working. Screw your two boxes and light fixture into place, then gather your supplies. Before you even start wiring, you want to get the fixtures securely in place so that you can effectively wire everything together. You will need:\nTwo 3-Way Switches\nTwo 2-wire non-metallic (NM) cable\nOne 3-wire NM cables\n2 6\" pieces of grounding wire Slide the 2-wire NM power cable into the first switch box. Take your power wire, coming from the house, and slide it into the first switch box. Choose a direction that will make it easy for you to then thread the wire towards your second switch box. Remove about 9 inches of sheathing from the wire. Strip off enough of the rubber coating around your NM wire to expose the wires underneath. Some people prefer to do this before feeding into the switch box, but it doesn't matter. You want roughly 3\" of wire in the box, and 6\" outside the box. Run a 3-wire NM cable between the first and second boxes. Strip 6-9\" on one end to expose the three separate wires, then run the first half into your first switch box. Repeat on the other end and run it into your second switch box. Cut the cable to length if there is extra once you pull through the second box. This third wire allows power to run to your second switch even if the first one is off. Use a cable staple to secure the wires to the wall or stud within 8\" of the box. Cables must be secured so that, if there is tugging or pulling further down the line, the live wires don't rip out of the box and cause issues. Some boxes have clamps to hold onto the wires. Current electrical codes require any switch box without built-in clamps to have the wires secured within eight inches of the box. Secure to the center of the stud, in the wall, so that it will not be hit by drywall studs later on if you were to hang anything near the light. Pull another 2-wire NM cable through the second switch box, just like you did in the very beginning with the first box. The only difference is that this 2-wire cable is not a power cable from the wall -- it is a free-hanging cable that you will use to attach the light. Be sure to strip 9\" and pull the wires through into the second switch box. Be sure to secure all wires within 8\" of the box. Pull the 2-wire cable from the second box up and into the light fixture. Strip away 6-9\" of the sheathing and pull your wires in so that they can attach to the light. Again, be sure to use a cable staple to support the wire within 8\" of the box. Strip 1\" off of the individual ends of all the smaller wires. A 2-wire NM cable is actually made up of smaller wires, run together for convenience. You exposed those wires already, but now you need to strip the rubber sheath off of the very end of each of these little wires. Curve the ends of every black and red cable into small hooks. This will make them easier to attach to the actual switches. You'll hook this around a screw, which you then tighten to clamp down the wire to the light switch. The should look like little canes. This is often easiest with needle-nose pliers. Use wire nuts to attach the each set of two white wires together. Twist the two white, neutral wires together in each box and twist on a wire nut. Keep twisting until the wires are secured and the nut stays in place when let go. There are two sets to attach--\nThe pair in the first switch box\nThe pair in the second switch box Use wire nuts to attach the two pairs of green/orange grounding wires together, adding a 6\" piece of copper grounding wire to each pair as well. Take all three ends and hold them together, then twist on the wire nut so they are all securely fastened together. You should have two wires tracing back through your NM cables, and one hanging ground wire on each set. This extra grounding wire will be attached to the light switches. It is called a \"pigtail\" in electrical parlance. After making all your connections, fold the wires neatly into the box. You want to zig-zag them, so they come about a bit like an accordion. You can tuck the wires in the light switch back too -- though they didn't get any work done. Your two switch boxes should each be wired identically, like so:\nTwo white, neutral wires tied off by a wire nut. Two grounding wires, plus one pigtail, tied off by a wire nut.

The 2 wire cable feed from the power source enters the bottom of the switch box and the hot (black) wire connects to the common or shunt terminal on the 3-way switch. There is only one such terminal on a 3-way switch, and it is usually identified as the one having a different color terminal screw (often significantly darker) from the other two terminal screws (not counting the green ground screw). Connect the 3 wire cable's white insulated wire (neutral) directly to the 2 wire 'feed' white insulated (neutral) wire with wire nuts (there is no connection of any white wires to this switch). Connect 3 wire cable in the first switch box. The 3 wire cable enters through the top of the first switch box. The red insulated wire connects to either one of the 2 unused terminal screws (shown in the image above to be on the top left and right sides of both 3-way switches). It does not matter to which terminal screw this wire is connected. Connect the black insulated wire to the remaining unused terminal screw on the switch. Connect wires in the light fixture's box. Again, connect all ground wires as previously described, if not already completed. In the light fixture's box, there will be two 3 wire cables. One 3 wire cable originates at the first switch box and has its white insulated wire as a neutral. The other 3 wire cable originates at the second switch box and will become the \"switch leg\". Mark both ends of this wire by wrapping it with black electrical tape to alert others working on the circuit later that it is no longer neutral. This is a newer electrical code requirement, but has been a common practice whenever a white or gray wire is / or can become hot. Connect the two red insulated wires together with a wire nut. Connect the black wire coming from the first 3-way switch and the white \"switch leg\" wire coming from the second 3-way switch (has black tape wrapped around it) together with a wire nut. Connect 3 wire cable in the second switch box to the switch. Connect all ground wires as previously described, if not already completed. Connect the black insulated wire to the shunt or common terminal screw of the switch (once again, the common screw terminal is the different colored screw from the rest of those on the switch). Connect the red insulated wire to one of the two unused terminal screws (it does not matter which). Connect the \"switch leg\" (white wire with black tape) to the remaining unused terminal screw on the switch. Connect the fixture. The light fixture's box should have only a black wire, a white wire and a ground wire to supply power to the fixture. Finish up. Check all wire nuts for tightness and exposed neutral and hot conductor surfaces. Fold all wires carefully into the boxes and secure devices and fixture with screws. Install plates and covers. Restore power and test. Understanding Common Cable Types Understand non-metallic cables. NM (also called \"Romex\u00ae\") and UF (\"underground feeder\") cables both have plastic jacket wrapped around 2 (or more) insulated wires - including one white and one black - and a single uninsulated wire. NM is used indoors and UF is used outdoors, when subjected to sunlight, or when buried underground. NM cable is easier to work than other cable types, requires no special tools or preparation, and costs less. For these reasons, it is widely used. It is not, however, authorized for use in all installations, such as being embedded in concrete or where exposed to the risk of physical damage. Understand armored cable types, including BX, MC and AC. Armored cable types are very similar with only slight variations. They consist of a metal jacket formed by an interlocking, helically wound band of steel or aluminum around two (or more) insulated wires - including one white, one black, and often one green. Cables lacking a green insulated wire use the outer metal jacket as the ground conductor. Type AC is fabricated with a continuous internal bonding conductor in contact with the metal sheath. Of these armored cable types, only Type NM can be installed outside or for direct burial underground, and only if listed (tested) and labeled for that purpose. Know the restrictions of each cable type. There are unique precautions and instructions for each type and special connectors for armored cables. For example, do not use a Romex (Type NM) connector on an armored cable, even though many connectors appear similar. If the power source is from an armored cable that lacks a full size (#12 or #14) ground wire, use a metal box to extend the ground from the armored shell to the box and to the circuit's ground wire. Do this by threading a special green, hex-headed grounding machine screw into a pre-tapped hole in the metal box, or use a special green ground clip. Become familiar with cable naming conventions. All of these cables have \"trade names\" which are basically derived from the number of insulated non-ground conductors, construction type and manufacturers' names. For example, a \"twelve-two (12/2) Romex\u00ae\" cable has two #12 conductors, plus a full sized #12 ground. A \"fourteen-three (14/3) BX\" cable is a metal-armored cable with three #14 conductors, plus a full sized #14 ground. Some types of BX are also tested and approved for using the sheath as a grounding or bonding conductor.",
