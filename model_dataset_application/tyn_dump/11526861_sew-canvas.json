    "If you\u2019re working with lighter canvas, use a darker pen.",
    "Apply a strip of basting tape over the seam to keep it in place.",
    "Measure and cut a strip of basting tape from the spool that matches the length of the seam.",
    "Try to use basting tape that\u2019s the same width as your seam allowance, so your stitches can be consistent.Tape allows you to stitch more seamlessly without needing to pull out pins.",
    "For instance, if your seam allowance is 0.5 in (1.3 cm), use basting tape that\u2019s 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide.",
    "Be sure to peel off the backing tape before you start sewing, so both pieces of fabric can stick together.",
    "Press and stick 2 pieces of canvas together using the basting tape.",
    "Line the opposite edge of canvas together, so the seam allowances overlap evenly.",
    "Match up the edges so that both stick together with the basting tape.",
    "Press along the edge of the canvas to fully connect the materials together.The basting tape provides a more durable hold for your simple overlapping seam.",
    "Don\u2019t press on the canvas until both sides are lined up.",
    "Feed the fabric through the machine around 0.125 in (0.32 cm) away from 1 edge.",
    "Arrange the canvas pieces so the edge of the material is directly aligned beneath the sewing machine foot.",
    "Turn on the sewing machine and stitch in a straight line along 1 of the seam edges, keeping the stitches close to the seam\u2019s edge.You\u2019ll be doing this twice, so don\u2019t stitch in the center of the seam allowance area.",
    "If you\u2019re comfortable with a sewing machine, feel free to feed the canvas through the machine more quickly.",
    "Flip the material over and place it at the foot of the sewing machine.",
    "Turn the stitched material 180 degrees so the other end of the seam is settled at the sewing machine.",
    "Realign the sewing needle, keeping it about 0.125 in (0.32 cm) from the opposite, unstitched side of the seam.The finished overlapping seam looks like 2 parallel lines of stitches next to one another.",
    "Stitch down the fabric around 0.125 in (0.32 cm) from the opposite edge.",
    "Feed the canvas through the machine again, keeping the needle in as straight a line as possible.",
    "Work to the opposite end of the seam, forming an identical parallel line to the other row of stitches.Remove the canvas from the sewing machine once you\u2019ve finished stitching these seams.",
    "Trim off any excess thread from the material.",
    "Take a pair of scissors and snip off the extra thread still attached to the seams.",
    "Cut off the thread carefully, so you don\u2019t accidentally undo the stitched seams in the process.Most sewing machines have built-in thread cutters.",
    "Feel free to use this device to get rid of your extra thread.",
    "Stitching a Flat Fell Seam Choose a flat fell seam if you don\u2019t want your stitches to be as visible.",
    "Use this stitch for more visually appealing projects, where you don\u2019t want the seam to be apparent or visible on either side of the material.",
    "Instead of sewing up and down the canvas, flat fell seams require you to fold in some of the fabric.If you aren\u2019t experienced with a sewing machine, this seam might be tricky.",
    "This seam is commonly used on the sides of jeans.",
    "Mark your seam allowance at 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm).",
    "Use a ruler and soapstone marker or pencil to measure out a small increment along the edges of both canvas pieces.",
    "Determine how large you\u2019d like this seam to be; if you\u2019re inexperienced with a sewing machine, keep in mind that smaller seam allowances leave less of a margin for error.Use multiple dashes to mark your seam allowance, so you can keep track of the guidelines later on.",
    "Overlap both pieces of canvas and pin them into place.",
    "Take 1 canvas edge and guide it over the second edge, lining up both seam allowances as you go.",
    "Since you aren\u2019t using basting tape for this, use sturdy pins to keep the material in place.Make sure to pin the bottom and top edges of the canvas, as this will help the material stay in position.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to use pins, try using binding clips instead.",
    "Feed the overlapped pieces of canvas through the sewing machine.",
    "Use a basic stitch to connect both pieces of canvas together.",
    "Remove the pins as you go, continuing to stitch until you reach the opposite end of the material.",
    "Once you\u2019ve finished sewing, use a pair of scissors to trim away any excess fabric puckering around the seam.If you have a lot of excess thread, trim it away with a pair of scissors or the built-in thread cutter on the machine.",
    "Fold the material over the hem and press it down to create a fold on the seam.",
    "Bring the rightmost piece of stitched canvas and flip it to line up with the opposite piece of canvas.",
    "Check that the folded fabric is covering 1 side of your open seam, and press along this edge to add a second layer to your seam.This is considered the backside of your project.",
    "Pressing the fabric over the seam helps the overlapped seam to appear folded in your finished project.",
    "Flip the canvas over so you\u2019re working on the front side.",
    "Examine the now visible edge of the seam, checking that the previously trimmed edges of the canvas are facing upwards.",
    "At this point, make sure that the stitched canvas is still folded in half, and not splayed out.",
    "Fold and press the canvas over the seam.",
    "Take the folded section of canvas and move it to the left, allowing it to cover the previously visible seam.",
    "Run 2 fingers down the edge of new fold to keep the material in place, and to accentuate the folded seam in the center.Both sides of the canvas should be splayed out now, with both pieces of material resembling an open book.",
    "Stitch the edge of the seam you just folded.",
    "Bring the newly folded canvas over to the sewing machine, aligning the needle on the edge of this new seam.",
    "Feed the material through the machine, stitching along the seam in a straight line.",
    "Continue sewing until you reach the edge of the folded seam.You should see 1 parallel line of stitches along the edge of the seam.",
    "Sew along the edge of the opposite seam.",
    "Flip the canvas around by 180 degrees and align the sewing needle along the opposite edge of the folded scene.",
    "Guide the needle along the canvas, working the thread in a straight line.",
    "Continue stitching until you reach the opposite end of the seam.",
    "At this point, check that you have 2 parallel lines of stitches going along the edges of the hem.If you aren\u2019t experienced with a sewing machine, feel free to go as slowly as you need.",
    "The seam should look like a folded portion of fabric running down the center of the canvas pieces.",
    "Cut away any loose threads hanging from the canvas.",
    "Use a pair of scissors to remove any threads dangling from either end of the seam.",
    "Trim the threads without unraveling the stitching, so your sewn canvas can stay secure.If you\u2019d prefer, use the thread cutter attached to your sewing machine instead.",
    "Hand-Stitching Canvas Assemble sturdy needles and thread if you\u2019d prefer to sew manually.",
    "Invest in strong needles designed for sewing canvas sails.",
    "Note that sail needles are ordered by size, with higher numbers indicating smaller needles.",
    "If you\u2019re stitching a sail, use a curved bench or sailmaker\u2019s hook to hold the canvas in place while you\u2019re stitching it together.",
    "Additionally, look for twine or other thread labeled for outdoor use.If your needles and thread aren\u2019t thick enough, then your stitches won\u2019t hold in the thick material.",
    "Use a round stitch if you need a basic seam.",
    "Work the threaded needle into the connected edges of canvas, stitching in a loop formation down the seam.",
    "Pull the thread or twine tightly until you reach the ends of the material.If you\u2019re working with a large canvas project, secure the material into a bench hook.",
    "If you\u2019re working with a small canvas project, pin or clip the edges together ahead of time.",
    "Thread an awl to stitch more efficiently.",
    "Follow the product\u2019s instructions to loop the heavy-duty thread through the bobbin and into the awl itself.",
    "Check that the thread is looped through the central needle before you start any stitch work.Keep your thread of choice nearby as you work.",
    "Loop thread with the awl to create a series of stitches.",
    "Use a firm block of wood or other sturdy surface to arrange and display your canvas, then stick the tip of the awl into the part of the canvas that you\u2019d like to stitch.",
    "Measure out your desired stitch length and add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to this sum.",
    "Loop this amount of thread around the thread before removing the awl from the canvas.",
    "Pull on both ends of the thread to tighten and form your first stitch.One end of the thread will be attached to the awl, while the other will be attached to the canvas.",
    "Repeat the process along your hem until you\u2019ve finished sewing your canvas."
