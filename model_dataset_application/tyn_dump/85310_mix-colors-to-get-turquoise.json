There are small amounts of other colors hidden within each pigment, which means that each paint shade is predisposed to mix well with a certain other shade. Turquoise is basically a mix of blue and green, so make sure to use a blue that already contains green pigments. You should be able to guess at the pigment bias just by looking at a color: a greenish-blue suggests a green bias, while a purplish-blue hints at a red bias. Phthalo blue and phthalo green pigments are some of the most commonly-used in turquoise paints. Phthalo blue (short for the pigment phthalocyanine) contains a strong green bias, so it is optimally suited for mixing turquoise. Many commercial paint brands feature a \"phthalo blue\" product. Blue paint contains either red pigments or green pigments. If a given blue pigment has a green bias, it contains more green pigment than red pigment. Other (typically purplish) blue pigments have a red bias, and these will be less suited to making turquoise. You can't find a \"pure\" blue paint pigment \u2013 that is to say, a blue paint hue that will make both a good green (when mixed with yellow) and a good purple (when mixed with red). This is because the blue will always have a bias towards either red or green due to the chemical impurities within each pigment."
