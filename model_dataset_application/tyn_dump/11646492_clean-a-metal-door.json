This will help remove any dust or pollen that has built up over time. If you leave it in place, you might just spread this dust around when you actually wash the door. If the door is very dirty, it may be easier to vacuum it to remove dirt and cobwebs."

          "description":"It might seem simple, but often, all you'll need to get your metal door clean is some soapy water. Start by filling a large bucket with warm or hot water. Then, squeeze in a large squirt of liquid dish soap\u2014you don't have to measure precisely, but about 1 US tbsp (15 ml) should be enough. Warm water will dissolve dirt and dust more effectively than cold water. Just make sure it's not hot enough to scald you! You can also use liquid laundry detergent, if you prefer."

          "description":"Take your cleaning cloth or sponge and saturate it in the soapy water. Then, squeeze the sponge or twist the cloth to get rid of most of the water. That way, it won't drip all over when you start cleaning. If your door isn't super dirty, use a microfiber cloth to clean it gently. However, if you think you'll need to give the door a more vigorous scrubbing, opt for a sponge with a soft side and a scrubby side, instead."

As you work, rinse out the cloth or sponge in the soapy water whenever it starts to get dirty, wringing out the excess water each time. If you start cleaning from the bottom, dirty water will drip down onto the areas you've already cleaned, which is why it's best to start at the top of the door. Tip: Try folding your cleaning cloth in quarters. Then, when one side gets dirty, flip the cloth over and use the opposite side. Once that's dirty, flip the last fold the opposite directions and you'll have two new, clean sides of the cloth! You can even refold the cloth entirely to use the other side if you need to."

Wet a clean cloth in the water and wring it out, then wipe down the door, working from top to bottom once again. This will remove any soapy residue that's left on the door.
