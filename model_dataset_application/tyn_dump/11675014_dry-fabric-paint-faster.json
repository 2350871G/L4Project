          "description":"Before using fabric paint, you have to wash and dry your fabric to avoid shrinking in the future. While many people line dry their fabrics before using their fabric paint, your paint will dry more quickly if you tumble-dry the fabric on high heat. As soon as your fabric is done drying in the machine, begin painting immediately.Tip:  If the paint is flat, the color is even, and the fabric behind the area you painted doesn\u2019t feel wet, your paint is dry. You can also tap the paint gently with a small cotton swab to see if some of the color comes off. Fabric paint dries faster when it is exposed to heat. Painting on a warm surface will start the drying process while you\u2019re still creating your design."

If you want to heat the fabric further, set up a space heater in the room where the fabric is drying. Set the space heater on low and move flammable materials at least 3 feet (0.91 m) away from the heater as you dry the fabric.Warning: Space heaters are known to cause fires if left unattended. Don\u2019t leave your home while the fabric is drying and stay nearby to avoid a fire. If it starts to smell like smoke, turn your space heater off immediately. If it gets hotter than 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C), your paint may actually melt as it dries, which can ruin your design. High heat is good for the drying process, but extreme heat is not. Use either the space heater or your thermostat. Do not combine these methods."

If the fabric is hanging up, brace the bottom of the fabric and hold it still with your nondominant hand.Tip: To test your fabric to see if it\u2019s getting too hot, try touching it for 20 seconds. If it doesn\u2019t hurt to touch, you\u2019re fine. If your hand starts to feel uncomfortable or it hurts to hold your hand there, stop heating the fabric. If the air gets too hot, it can melt the paint as it dries. This will ruin the image that you\u2019ve painted. If you use a high heat setting, the fabric may become too hot."
