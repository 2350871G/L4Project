Sure, you could count the cards, but it wouldn't result in you winning anything. Try to walk before you run. It's in your favor to practice in casinos, if you plan on counting cards at casinos. Unlike at your kitchen table, there are a ton of other factors going on that must be considered -- like hiding the fact that you're hustling everyone. When you play blackjack with a well-practiced strategy, you get the house's advantage to relatively 0. All casino games are in favor of the house, so this 0 is pretty good!"

Even though the math is very simple, it's easy to get side tracked. Don't be surprised if you end up with a different number consistently in the beginning stages.

It's a lot more common to run into a game that is working with 5 or 6 (in what's called the shoe). Because of this, your running count may not be the true count. To find the true count, divide the running count by the number of decks waiting to be dealt. If your running count is +4 and there are 4 decks left, the true count is actually +1. To know how many decks are left, you're gonna have to take a covert look at the discard tray. Do this between hands, when you have the extra bit of time. If you are working with a single deck, you invert and multiply. Say you have 3/4 of a deck left and the count is +4. You would then multiply 4 x 4 to get 16 and divide it by 3 (a little over 5). Some people choose just to go with the running count in a single deck, but know that the true count is always a little bit different (higher, regardless)."

    "When you see a low card and a high card, they cancel each other out.",
    "Keeping this in mind will make it much easier as the cards fly by you at lightning speeds.",
    "Counting cards is about remembering a tally.",
    "Counting cards well is about accuracy and speed.",
    "To be a good card counter, it has to be like riding a bike -- you can go on autopilot at the drop of a hat.",
    "Taking in pairs gives you a lot less to worry about, making it easier for you to be accurate.",
    "Get the true count.",
    "Long gone are the days when casinos work with just one deck (mostly, at least).",
    "It's a lot more common to run into a game that is working with 5 or 6 (in what's called the shoe).",
    "Because of this, your running count may not be the true count.",
    "To find the true count, divide the running count by the number of decks waiting to be dealt.",
    "If your running count is +4 and there are 4 decks left, the true count is actually +1.",
    "To know how many decks are left, you're gonna have to take a covert look at the discard tray.",
    "Do this between hands, when you have the extra bit of time.",
    "If you are working with a single deck, you invert and multiply.",
    "Say you have 3/4 of a deck left and the count is +4.",
    "You would then multiply 4 x 4 to get 16 and divide it by 3 (a little over 5).",
    "Some people choose just to go with the running count in a single deck, but know that the true count is always a little bit different (higher, regardless).",
    "Practice with distractions.",
    "It's all well and good if you can count cards in the comfort of your own home, door locked, curtains drawn, and telephone off the hook.",
    "But when you do it at a casino?",
    "There will be a thousand and one distractions taking place at the same time.",
    "Doesn't matter how simple the math is -- if you get off by 1, you're shooting yourself in the foot.",
    "Start by turning the TV on.",
    "Then add the radio.",
    "Throw in a dog and a few kids and you'll almost be at the level you'll be dealing with at any hopping casino.",
    "Not to mention you'll have several sets of eyes watching you at all times -- you've got to be accurate and low-key.",
    "Learning Other Styles of Card Counting Consider learning other types of card counting.",
    "For the record, Hi-Lo is the most popular for a reason -- it yields good results and it's simple to master.",
    "However, there are a number of varieties.",
    "In KO, the difference is that 7s are worth +1.",
    "In Omega II, 4, 5, and 6 are worth +2.",
    "10, J, Q, and K are worth -2 and Aces are worth 0.",
    "In halves, 2 and 7 are worth +.5.",
    "5 is worth +1.5.",
    "9 is worth -.5.",
    "Know the statistics of each variety.",
    "Statistical analysts have these numbers all figured out and it's not a simple, \"Does it work or not?\"",
    "There are a number of factors to take into account:\nWhen it comes to betting correlation (BC), Halves has the highest correlation.",
    "This is used to predict betting situations.",
    "Hi-Opt II and Omega II have the highest playing efficiency (PE).",
    "This determines decisions and deviations (when you change from basic strategy) in play.",
    "Hi-Opt II has the highest insurance correlation (IC).",
    "This tells you when it's best to buy insurance (because Hi-Opt II has an additional Ace count).",
    "As you can see, Hi-Lo is not mentioned.",
    "This is because it falls in the middle of the pack for every factor.",
    "Hi-Opt II has an additional Ace count and Halves is just tedious (adding further distraction) and Omega IIs playing efficiency doesn't match the betting correlation.",
    "Unless you're the best blackjack player this side of the Mississippi, stick to Hi-Lo.",
    "Learn the concept of \"wonging,\" or back-counting.",
    "It is called \"wonging in\" when you stay away from a table until it's hot enough to warrant joining.",
    "When the table grows cold, you \"wong out.\"",
    "It's typically done on bigger decks, otherwise you'd be getting up as soon as you sat down.",
    "Lots of casinos have banned mid-shoe entry for this purpose.",
    "If you do consider doing this, know that it looks fishy to even untrained eyes.",
    "How else would you know when to swoop in for the kill if you weren't counting cards?",
    "The suspicions you do avoid, however, are changing your bets.",
    "When you're wonging, you bet the same exorbitant amount every time.",
    "Camouflaging Your Strategy Act like a tourist.",
    "Card counters are notorious for playing blackjack for hours and hours, often without eating or enjoying the amenities available at the resort.",
    "Acting like a tourist just looking for a simple good time may take the suspicion off of you.",
    "You want to blend in.",
    "Busting out your three-piece Armani suit is not what you want to do when starting your card counting career at your local casino.",
    "Leave the Italian suede at home and act like a regular Joe.",
    "Let your bet ride, if you need to increase the bet.",
    "Dealers are trained to shuffle the deck upon an unexplainable increase in the bet.",
    "For this reason, only up your bet in small increments and at seemingly random points in the game.",
    "This may seem counter to making money, but if you get thrown out, you'll be making zero.",
    "No, card counting isn't illegal, but it is heavily frowned upon and you can be asked to never return.",
    "Appear to be interested in other things besides the game.",
    "This is why we had you practicing with the TV, radio, and several messy, loud-mouthed children.",
    "If you are so busy counting your lips are practically moving, it's a dead giveaway.",
    "Go ahead, get a drink, make small talk.",
    "Enjoy yourself.",
    "Counters have a reputation for being \"zoned in\" to the game.",
    "He will remain fixated on their cards while everyone else is looking at a gorgeous woman.",
    "Don't be that guy.",
    "You need to be proficient enough at counting that you can carry on a conversation.",
    "Chat with the dealer about how their day is going.",
    "If the pit boss comes up, chat with him, too.",
    "Tip the dealer.",
    "Many dealers know how to count cards.",
    "A dealer that likes you will be more likely to wait before shuffling on a favorable deck and shuffle sooner on a bad one.",
    "A dealer can help you or hurt you.",
    "Motivate the dealer to be for you.",
    "Same goes for the entire pit crew -- get them on your side, your not-so-heinous crime may slide under their radar.",
    "Know who's watching you.",
    "At any time, there are hundreds of cameras going on in the casino in addition to the eyes of the dealers, those in the pit (behind the tables), and the security staff.",
    "If they'll catch a waitress for serving a customer every 18.37 minutes, they'll definitely have the attention span to monitor you.",
    "Because of this, it's very important to be on your best behavior.",
    "If a casino suspects you're counting, they probably won't come right out and say it.",
    "They may have someone start a conversation with you to distract you, assign you a high-speed dealer, shuffle spontaneously or change the betting rules.",
    "If any of these happen, back down slowly, but immediately.",
    "Do everything slow.",
    "When you hit a table, stay there for a spell.",
    "Why would you leave?",
    "And when you make your moves at this table, take a second to think about it.",
    "Normal blackjack players haven't spent the past three months staring at this exact set up in black and white.",
    "Everything you do needs to be nonchalant and casual.",
    "Do not jump from table to table every time the deck sours.",
    "This will bring you to the attention of the casino personnel fast.",
    "Make minimum bets until the deck is richer.",
    "Increase casually because you're doing well -- not because you know what's about to come."
