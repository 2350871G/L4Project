          "description":"Creating realistic images with colored pencils involves layering multiple colors on top of one another to generate accurate textures. Layering refers to the process of applying multiple colors on top of one another. To start layering, you\u2019ll want to start with a base layer. Then, add additional layers of different colors on top to create shades, texture, or form. Using different techniques while layering will prove to be an essential part of creating realistic images."

        {
          "headline":"Use the back and forth stroke to evenly fill in color.",
          "description":"Layering is most commonly done with the back and forth stroke. To use the back and forth stroke, angle your colored pencil towards your paper at 45 degrees and apply pressure evenly while drawing continuously over an area. Practice keeping each stroke relatively straight. This will keep your shading even and uniform. This is probably how you started drawing when you were younger. You just probably never knew the name for it! If you want to make certain areas darker while using the back and forth stroke, change the amount of pressure you\u2019re applying to the paper."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try scumbling to fill in color in uneven patterns.",
          "description":"Scumbling involves pressing the tip of your colored pencil into the paper and moving it around an area in uneven circles. This technique is typically used to layer a single color with another color in instances where you want to create uneven or jagged textures. The texture you create when scumbling changes based on the pressure you\u2019re applying and on the size of circles that you\u2019re creating. You can also scumble by using figure-eights to create a smoother texture. Similarly, you can scumble by using shaky lines to create a rougher texture."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use hatching and cross-hatching to create specific effects.",
          "description":"Hatching involves drawing a sequence of parallel lines that are close to one another. Cross-hatching refers to two layers of hatching that rest on top of one another, typically at right angles. To use the hatching or cross-hatching technique, rapidly create straight lines by moving your whole wrist and lifting your pencil off of the page after each stroke. You typically want to keep your lines as straight as possible to ensure a uniform pattern. Hatching is often used to create unique forms and add volume to a shape."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try stippling to bring a unique consistency to a composition.",
          "description":"Stippling is a technique used in art where you create an image by placing a lot of small dots next to one another. Stippling is one of the easier methods to use, since it only involves making a series of small dots with your pencil, but it can be rather time consuming. Stippling can be impressive because it adds a unique weight to each object in a drawing. Just keep in mind that it can take a long time if you\u2019re using it to create an entire piece!"

Because colored pencils are transparent, you should still be able to make out any preliminary lines in your drawing underneath the initial layers. You probably want to use the back and forth technique for the initial layers since it\u2019s the easiest way to fill in colors evenly. Start with the lightest colors first. It\u2019s easier to make something darker with colored pencils, but it can be difficult to make something lighter without erasing anything."

          "description":"Using darker skin-tone colors like umber, cream, or burnt sienna, begin adding layers of color to the sections of the face that should be darker. This is where you\u2019ll likely find yourself using cross-hatching, hatching, and scumbling to add new textures to the portrait. Pay close attention to the way light is hitting your subject. The darker areas of a face require more layers than lighter ones. Make sure that you\u2019re not using the wrong technique to add texture to the hair. If your subject\u2019s hair is curly, scumbling makes sense. But if it\u2019s straight and flat, you probably want to use hatching."

Begin by selecting appropriate colors for each facial feature. When adding detail to facial features, apply color and shape to the necessary elements in careful increments. Pick appropriate techniques for each feature. Eyebrows are often created with hatching lines, while stippling is often used to add depth to the eyes."

They're actually a complex range of lighter and darker shades of brown. In addition, you\u2019ll want to leave a small round area in each eye where they catch light. The white of the eye isn\u2019t actually white. It\u2019s usually a thin shade of blue and red."

Keep that in mind when looking for the proper colors to add. You\u2019ll also want to make the top lip darker than the bottom one, since it angles downwards."

          "description":"The colors in a realistic portrait should be well blended and contain strong highlights where the light hits. You\u2019ll typically want to highlight sharper angles, like the bridge of the nose, and reflective surfaces, like the pupil. Using an eraser, lift small streaks of color off of the areas you hope to highlight in order to expose the paper underneath. You can use a white colored pencil if you\u2019d like, but the highlight will be muddier and less vibrant. When using an eraser to blend, be careful about how much pressure you apply. This should be done sparingly and carefully."
