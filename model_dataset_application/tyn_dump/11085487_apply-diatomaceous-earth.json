In these situations, you can make a wet application to spray onto those infected areas. After being applied, diatomaceous earth will reduce the number of pests and bugs within 1 to 5 days, just depending on the type of pest. In addition to being a good option for hard to reach areas, a wet solution works well in areas that are really windy, as the dry powder would just blow away.Did You Know: Diatomaceous earth is made from the fossilized remains of algae. When insects come into contact with it, the powder penetrates their bodies and essentially absorbs all of their fat and oil, causing them to dehydrate and die."
