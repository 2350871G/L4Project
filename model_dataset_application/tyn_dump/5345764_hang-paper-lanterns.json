Make sure that the lanterns you hang match any patterns, colors or themes present in your room. Take a trip to a nearby Chinatown or shop online to find the perfect colored lanterns. Match colors with similar colors. Categories of colors, like earth tones, jewel tones or warm/cool colors should be matched to similar colored lanterns. For example, a red couch would be well accented with warm colored lanterns, like orange and yellow. If your bedroom has a navy blue bedspread, match it with cool colored lanterns, like light blue, white or dark green. Match patterns. Paper lanterns come in a variety of colors, and some even have patterns. If you have floral patterns on a chair or bedspread, find a complementary patterned lantern online. Try to match diamond patterns, spiral patterns, or plaids. Be careful that the lanterns don't clash or overload your room with the pattern, however."

Look for small, screw-in hooks at a local hobby store or at hardware store. Look for hooks small enough that they won\u2019t be noticed, and consider buying some that match the color of your walls."

          "description":"Most homes in America have interior walls and ceilings made of drywall. Drywall isn\u2019t meant to bear a lot of weight, but since paper lanterns are lighter than paintings or mirrors, you can go ahead and screw your hooks directly into it. Alternatively, if you want to hang your lanterns from a wood surface like a cabinet or a shelf, you can use the same method. Drill a pilot hole. While you may be tempted to screw the hook in by hand, it\u2019ll be much easier if you drill a pilot hole. Choose a drill bit that\u2019s the same size as the inner core of the hook, not the width of the threads. Power up your drill and drill straight into the wall, making sure your hole goes all the way through the drywall. Screw in your hook. Place the hook into the hole, then begin screwing it into the wall. Apply pressure as you turn the hook clockwise, stopping when the base of the hook is flush with the drywall."

          "description":"Some homes have walls or ceilings made of plaster or brick, which are hard or almost impossible to drill through. For these surfaces, consider using adhesive hooks. They aren\u2019t quite as sturdy as hooks that screw into the wall, but they\u2019ll work for something as light as a paper lantern. Their strong adhesive will keep them attached for years and they\u2019re easier to use if you\u2019re nervous about using a  drill."

          "headline":"Thread your lanterns with fishing line.",
          "description":"Your lantern is going to hang from a hook, so it needs a line to hang from. You can use twine or fishing line to hang the lanterns, depending on how \u201cinvisible\u201d you want the line to seem. Find twine at a craft store, or check out an outdoor/adventure store for some inexpensive fishing line. Cut the line to the right length. If you want all of your lanterns to hang at the same height, make sure that you cut all of the lines to the same length. If you want them to be staggered, play with line lengths a bit to see what combination looks best. Tie a small loop at the end of your line. Most paper lanterns have a rigging device inside, shaped like a \u201cC\u201d. Because of this small hook, you don\u2019t need to tie the line onto the lantern directly. You can simply tie a small loop at the end of the line and then slip it over the \u201cC\u201d. Make sure your knot is tight so it doesn\u2019t come loose and let the lantern fall. Tie another loop at the top of the line. Tie the same knot at the top of the top of the line, then slip it over the hook."

          "description":"Some lamps have small lightbulbs inside that need to be plugged in. These can be a bit trickier to hang, because the cord will have to be hung as well. For these lamps, you\u2019ll need to screw in additional hooks and loop the cord through them, all the way to an outlet. Use an extension cord if the original cord isn\u2019t long enough. Look into buying battery powered lamps to avoid the unsightly cables altogether."

The main things you want to think about are durability and color scheme. You\u2019ll need to find special outdoor lanterns that fit the look you\u2019re going for. Use outdoor lanterns. Paper lanterns are great for use indoors, but they can be damaged by water. Look for lanterns specifically made for outdoor use: they\u2019ll typically be made of nylon or silk. You can find them online, at home improvement stores, or at patio decoration outlets. Pick a good color scheme. Unlike an indoor area that is already decorated, you\u2019ll have a bit more free reign in choosing the colors of your lanterns.

If you don\u2019t want to hang them from trees, or you don\u2019t have any, buy poles to hang your lanterns from. Some companies sell poles specifically for hanging lanterns on, but you can hang them off of any type of pole, as long as there\u2019s a place to attach a hook. Hang them from a fence. If you have a tall fence, you can simply tie the lanterns right onto the boards without a need for hooks. Hang them off of a railing. If you want to hang your lanterns from a wooden railing, you\u2019ll need a drill and some small hooks. If your railing is wrought iron, you can easily tie them on."

Try mixing the sizes of the lanterns to make your bunch even more eclectic feeling. Light a path with lanterns. Hang the paper lanterns low to the ground on short poles to create a cool effect.

    "For these lamps, you\u2019ll need to screw in additional hooks and loop the cord through them, all the way to an outlet.",
    "Use an extension cord if the original cord isn\u2019t long enough.",
    "Look into buying battery powered lamps to avoid the unsightly cables altogether.",
    "Make sure never to use candles with your lanterns.",
    "Paper lanterns may have traditionally held candles instead of lightbulbs, but any open flame is unsafe, especially indoors.",
    "Use LED lamps or small lightbulbs in your lamps to avoid any accidents with open flame.",
    "Many lanterns come pre-lit for your convenience.",
    "Hanging Lanterns Outdoors Choose the right lanterns for your outdoor area.",
    "There are a lot of decisions that go into decorating a deck or backyard, just like a living room or bedroom.",
    "The main things you want to think about are durability and color scheme.",
    "You\u2019ll need to find special outdoor lanterns that fit the look you\u2019re going for.",
    "Use outdoor lanterns.",
    "Paper lanterns are great for use indoors, but they can be damaged by water.",
    "Look for lanterns specifically made for outdoor use: they\u2019ll typically be made of nylon or silk.",
    "You can find them online, at home improvement stores, or at patio decoration outlets.",
    "Pick a good color scheme.",
    "Unlike an indoor area that is already decorated, you\u2019ll have a bit more free reign in choosing the colors of your lanterns.",
    "Match them to your deck furniture, or go big with bright colors like red, blue or yellow.",
    "White lanterns can give your backyard a relaxed or dreamy atmosphere when it gets dark.",
    "Decide where to hang your lanterns.",
    "There are many places to hang them: in the air, on a fence or off of a railing.",
    "Each will give your backyard a different vibe, and it all depends on your personal preference.",
    "Depending on your choice, you\u2019ll need different tools and supplies.",
    "Hang your lanterns high up.",
    "If you have large trees, you can hang your lanterns from them for a cool effect.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to hang them from trees, or you don\u2019t have any, buy poles to hang your lanterns from.",
    "Some companies sell poles specifically for hanging lanterns on, but you can hang them off of any type of pole, as long as there\u2019s a place to attach a hook.",
    "Hang them from a fence.",
    "If you have a tall fence, you can simply tie the lanterns right onto the boards without a need for hooks.",
    "Hang them off of a railing.",
    "If you want to hang your lanterns from a wooden railing, you\u2019ll need a drill and some small hooks.",
    "If your railing is wrought iron, you can easily tie them on.",
    "Drill any necessary holes.",
    "If you\u2019ve chosen to hang your lanterns from a surface that requires hooks, you\u2019ll need to drill a pilot hole to help start the hook.",
    "Choose a drill bit with the same diameter as the core of the hook, then drill straight through the wooden railing.",
    "Pull out the drill, then screw your hook in, pushing clockwise until it\u2019s flush with the surface of the wood.",
    "Tie your lanterns up.",
    "Once all of your hooks or poles are installed, you\u2019ll be able to hang the lanterns.",
    "Use twine or fishing line so that the line doesn\u2019t distract from the effect of the lantern.",
    "Tie a small loop at the end of your twine, then slip it over lantern\u2019s hanger.",
    "As with the other end of the line, tie a sturdy knot around the fence, tree branch, hook, or other surface.",
    "Hanging Lanterns for a Party Decide on a theme.",
    "Whether you\u2019re planning a wedding, a family reunion or a simple barbecue, you\u2019ll want your lanterns to fit with a theme.",
    "White lanterns work well for weddings, while bright colors will brighten up a summer party.",
    "Search online for the perfect kind to fit your theme.",
    "Pick a holiday-specific color scheme.",
    "Christmas events generally feature red and green, while Easter parties use pastel colors like light pink, light purple and light yellow.",
    "Look for event-specific lanterns.",
    "Some paper lanterns have printed patterns specifically for holidays, like Menorahs for Hanukkah, hearts for Valentines day, or pumpkins for Halloween.",
    "If you're having a party to celebrate a game day, use colors from the sports team your group favors.",
    "Choose hooks that work for your surroundings.",
    "Parties can be held in a variety of different venues: tents, picnic shelters, even boats.",
    "You\u2019ll need to find fasteners that work for your situation, and most importantly, they\u2019ll have to be easy to remove.",
    "Think about using adhesive hooks, or try tying your lanterns directly to rafters or tent supports.",
    "Choose a configuration.",
    "Decide the placement of the lanterns and the heights at which they\u2019ll hang.",
    "Look online for ideas to match the setup that you are planning for.",
    "Sites like Pinterest have many example photos to help your creativity along.",
    "Consider hanging them high up above your guests\u2019 heads where they won\u2019t be in anyone\u2019s way.",
    "Tie lanterns across beams or supports.",
    "If your event setting has a shelter or tent, hang lanterns across the supports to create a large canopy of lights.",
    "Tie lanterns in bunches.",
    "Bunched lanterns hanging at different heights create great focal points at your party.",
    "Choose a point on a beam or support and tie five to ten lanterns in the same area, all at different heights.",
    "Try mixing the sizes of the lanterns to make your bunch even more eclectic feeling.",
    "Light a path with lanterns.",
    "Hang the paper lanterns low to the ground on short poles to create a cool effect.",
    "Use poles made for hanging potted plants, or make your own small poles with hooks.",
    "Then place the poles along a path or sidewalk to light the way to your party.",
    "Tie strings for your lanterns.",
    "Once you\u2019ve decided how high you want your lanterns to hang, it\u2019s time to tie them up using twine or fishing line to create an \u201cinvisible\u201d floating effect.",
    "Tie a sturdy loop at one end of the twine, then slip it over the lantern\u2019s hanging device.",
    "Then, tie the other end directly to a beam or loop it over a hook."
