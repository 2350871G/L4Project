Fusion Reserve and Fusion Conscription can be used if you use fusions with specific materials, and Fusion Recovery can recover your materials. If using specific materials, it can be a good idea to use fusion substitutes like King of the Swamp and Prisma."

Good Masked HEROs are Dark Law, Acid, Anki, and Koga, Dian and Divine Wind if using Form Change, and Contrast HERO Chaos if using Miracle Fusion. The best fusion monsters are the ones who only require a HERO monster and a certain attribute as their materials, like Absolute Zero, The Shining, Escuridao, and Nova Master. Also, include some Rank 4 Xyz monsters like Castel, Abyss Dweller, and Utopia and Utopia the Lightning, and Rank 8s like Hope Harbinger and Felgrand."
