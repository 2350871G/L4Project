    "Slide the coupling over the piston end and press it against the slip fix with considerable pressure.",
    "Be sure the slip coupling is flush with the piston end of the slip fix.",
    "Place the compressed slip fix against the piping to determine where to cut.",
    "Hold the slip fix and coupling against the region of your piping that needs to be repaired.",
    "Mark off the point of the piping that aligns with each side of the compressed slip fix using a permanent marker.",
    "Be sure the slip coupling is attached firmly to the slip fix before taking your measurements.",
    "Remove the damaged section of the piping with PVC pipe cutters.",
    "Align your PVC pipe cutter jaws around the first mark and grip the handles.",
    "Squeeze the handles of the cutters tightly while moving the cutters in an up and down motion.",
    "Continue doing this until you make a clean cut through the PVC piping.",
    "Now, repeat this process for the other cut line.",
    "Make sure the cuts are as straight as possible.",
    "Apply primer to the slip coupling and piston end of the slip fix.",
    "PVC primer softens the material and prepares it for solvent cement.",
    "Remove the slip coupling from the piston end of the slip fix.",
    "Now, use the brush applicator to apply primer to the inside 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the slip coupling as well as the top inner 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the piston end of the slip fix.",
    "Purchase PVC primer from home hardware stores.",
    "Apply solvent cement over the primer on the slip coupling and slip fix.",
    "Solvent cement is designed to bind PVC pipe fittings.",
    "Use the brush applicator to apply solvent cement to the same regions of the slip coupling and piston end of the slip fix that you applied PVC primer.",
    "Purchase solvent cement from home hardware stores.",
    "Push each slip piece together until they are flush against each other.",
    "Push the slip coupling over the piston end of the slip fix and press it in using a considerable amount of force.",
    "Once the two pieces are flush, turn the slip coupling \u00bc of the way around the piston end of the slip fix.",
    "Now, hold the pieces together in this position for 4 to 5 seconds.",
    "Wipe off excess solvent cement with a rag when you're finished.",
    "Apply PVC primer and solvent cement to the coupling and one repair pipe.",
    "Use your brush applicators to apply another 1 inch (2.5 cm) of PVC primer followed by  1 inch (2.5 cm) of solvent cement to the inner exposed end of the slip coupling.",
    "Afterward, do the same to the inner end of one of the pipes that you are repairing.",
    "Be sure the slip coupling and slip fix are firmly held together before this step.",
    "Install the coupling over the repair pipe covered with solvent cement.",
    "Press the exposed end of the slip coupling over the exposed repair pipe until it can't go any farther.",
    "Afterward, give it a 1/4 turn around the piping and hold it in place for 3 to 4 seconds.",
    "Again, wipe off excess solvent cement with a cloth when you're finished.",
    "Repeat the previous process for the remaining repair piping.",
    "Again, apply another 1 inch (2.5 cm) of PVC primer followed by 1 inch (2.5 cm) of solvent cement to the inner region of the remaining end of the slip fix, which is the piston end.",
    "Now, apply the same amounts of product to the inner end of the remaining exposed pipe you are repairing.",
    "Always apply PVC primer before you apply solvent cement.",
    "Connect the piston end of the slip fix to the remaining piping.",
    "Pull the piston end of the slip fix toward the remaining piping, turning it clockwise as you do so.",
    "Continue pulling the piston and turning it so that it extends over the piping until it cannot extend any farther.",
    "Let the solvent cement dry according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Turn the main water supply back on and flush your water lines.",
    "After the solvent cement dries, turn your main water supply back on and be sure that your piping doesn't leak.",
    "Once the piping is fixed, turn on the water lines for 5 to 10 minutes to flush out any debris that made its way into the system.",
    "If your piping still leaks, double-check that your slip fix and slip coupling are flush against each other and not loosely connected"
