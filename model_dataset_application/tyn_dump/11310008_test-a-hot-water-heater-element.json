Many heaters also have a plastic cover over the thermostat. These plastic covers fit in place by friction and typically have a tab on the top that you can pull to release them. Pull up on the tab to loosen the plastic cover and remove it from the thermostat. Not all water heaters have a plastic safety cover and insulation. If yours does not, skip this step."
