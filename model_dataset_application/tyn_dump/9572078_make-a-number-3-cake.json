  "text":" Cutting Round Cakes into a Number 3 Bake 2 round cake layers that are 8 inches (20 cm) wide. Use your favorite cake recipe or cake mix and pour the batter into 2 cake pans that are 8 inches (20 cm) across. Bake them for as long as your recipe or instructions suggest. When they\u2019re done, you should be able to insert a toothpick and pull it out without bringing any batter or crumbs out with it. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 5 minutes. If you remove the cakes too quickly, they may lose their shape or stick to the pan. Let them sit for 5 minutes before removing them from their pans. Transfer the cakes to a cooling rack. Cut around the outside of each cake with a butterknife to help keep them from sticking to the pan. Using potholders or hot pads, flip the pans upside down over a cooling rack so the cakes fall out. Use a glass to cut a circle out of the center of each cake. You can do this either by pressing down on the glass so that it cuts through the cake, or by holding the glass and using a knife to cut around it. Once you\u2019ve removed the center, set it aside.

Spread a little frosting on the end of one C-shaped cake, and connect the frosted part with the other cake to form a 3. The frosting will help it hold together, and prevent the frosting on top from falling through the crack. Use a bread knife to make the two cakes the same height if necessary. Layer cakes often come out slightly different sizes, and once you put your 2 pieces together you may realize they are different heights. If this is the case, simply remove the top layer of the highest cake by gently cutting sideways with a bread knife. Using Bundt Cake Pans Bake 2 cakes in Bundt cake pans. Bundt cake pans have a ring shape, so they will create circular cakes that can be shaped into a number 3. You can use a Bundt cake recipe, but it\u2019s also possible to use a layer cake recipe or cake mix -- just be aware that it may take considerably longer to bake than it would in a layer pan. Let the cakes cool for 5 minutes in the pan and 20-30 minutes on a rack. When you transfer them to a cooling rack, flip them out so that the flat part is touching the rack and the round part is on top. Cut away \u00bc of the first cake to make the bottom half of the 3. Use a bread knife to gently cut away a quarter of one of the Bundt cakes. The remaining \u00be will be the bottom half of your 3, and should look roughly like a C. Cut away \u00bd of the second cake to make the top half of the 3. This cake will be rotated to fit above the first cake to make a 3 shape. Make sure you brush away any crumbs after you finish cutting. Arrange the 2 cakes in a number 3 shape. The \u00bd cake should be on top, with one cut end touching the outside of the \u00be cake. If you\u2019re not satisfied with your 3, use a bread knife to shape it to your liking. Save any cake scraps you cut away to eat later if you wish. Use a little bit of frosting to connect the 2 cakes. This will help them stick together. Spread a little frosting on both of the cakes where they meet and gently press them together. Frosting the Cake Spread frosting with a butterknife or frosting spatula. Use your favorite frosting recipe or a canned frosting. Chocolate frosting or anything in a bright, fun color are great options for kids. Spread the frosting around the entire outside of the cake as evenly as possible, starting on top and working down to the sides. Smooth your frosting with a little hot water. Once you finish applying the frosting, you can smooth it out by dipping your knife or spatula in hot water, wiping it off with a towel, and running it gently over the surface of the frosting. This will slightly melt the frosting and cause it to get smoother. Add sprinkles or glitter sugar for a special touch. Kids love bright colors and glitter. Consider adding some rainbow sprinkles, glitter sugar, or even small candies like Skittles or M&Ms to the frosting to make the cake extra special. Use toothpicks and foil to keep the cake fresh without touching the frosting. Insert 6-8 toothpicks in the top of the cake, then gently lay the foil over the toothpicks and fold the edges of the foil around the rim of your cake dish. The toothpicks will keep the foil from touching the frosting, and won\u2019t leave visible holes in your cake.
