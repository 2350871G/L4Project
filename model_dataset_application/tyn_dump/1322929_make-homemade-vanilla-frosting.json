This will usually take around 30 minutes to an hour. If you want to speed things along, try cutting your butter into small cubes, flattening it with a rolling pin, or setting it over a shallow bowl filled warm water. Softened butter is much easier to mix and beat than butter that\u2019s fresh out of the \u2018fridge."

          "description":"Transfer your butter to the bowl, then shake in 2-3 cups (200-300 g) of confectioners sugar. Fold the butter and sugar together using a spatula until they form a loose mixture. If you want your frosting to be nice and sweet, use a full 3 cups (300 g) of sugar. If you\u2019d prefer a more subtle flavor, use closer to 2 cups (200 g). There\u2019s no need to spend too much time working your butter and sugar at this stage, since you\u2019ll be mixing all of your ingredients thoroughly later on."

You can adjust the amount of vanilla you use to suit your tastes, if you like. Heavy cream will produce a richer, more dense frosting than milk. Be careful not to add more than about 1.5 teaspoons (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract, as too much can easily become overpowering."

Continue beating your frosting for 1-2 minutes, or until it takes on a light, fluffy consistency. Set your mixer to low or medium speed to avoid sending bits of frosting flying everywhere.Alternative: If you\u2019re worried about your frosting coming out too thin, you can also add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of milk or cream to start, then incorporate your other 1 tablespoon (15 mL) gradually as you begin mixing."

You could also transfer your frosting to a lidded container to make sure no air gets inside. It will keep for about 2-3 days when stored at room temperature. Alternatively, you can put your frosting in the refrigerator, where it will stay fresh for up to 2 weeks. The large quantity of sugar in your homemade frosting will serve to stabilize the milk or cream, which means it can be left out of the refrigerator safely."
