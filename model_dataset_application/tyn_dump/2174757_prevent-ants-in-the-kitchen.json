  "text":" Cleaning and Repairing Your Kitchen Keep your kitchen free of garbage, spills, and food crumbs. Before doing any rigorous cleaning, take care to sweep up crumbs of food, take out the trash daily, and wipe up any spills with a microfiber cloth. You should also be sure to clean your dirty dishes as soon as possible, as they are a prime food source for ants. If you have pets, keep their bowls empty and clean when they're not eating. Clean your kitchen surfaces with vinegar and water. Start by creating a 1:1 solution of white distilled vinegar and water in a bowl. Now, dip a clean rag into it, squeeze it out, and wipe down the surfaces of your kitchen. Not only do ants hate the smell of vinegar, but it's also a great substitute for standard detergents that contain the environmentally-damaging phosphorus. Focus on areas that get the dirtiest or are most prone to ants. Store ripe fruits in the refrigerator. Ants are attracted to sugar and fruits are a prime source. Although ripe fruits can look pretty in your kitchen, it's best to keep them in the fridge to ensure that they don't attract ants. Oranges and lemons can be kept out as they are ant deterrents. Put non-fruit foods in airtight containers. Although sugars are the biggest ant attractors, any exposed food can attract them. Purchase Ziploc bags or airtight containers and put all of your other exposed foods in them. For the best results, put your food containers in the refrigerator. Remove ant trails with vinegar and water. Watch your kitchen ants carefully and determine the trails that they commonly follow\u2014these are likely the scented trails that lead the colony in and out of the home. Now, add 1 part vinegar and 3 parts water into a spray bottle and apply it to every trail you notice. Keep in mind that mopping and sweeping isn't enough to kill the scent of ant trails.

Seal gaps and cracks with a caulking gun. Apply caulk to any gaps around doors, baseboards, windows, and other openings that ants might find their way into your kitchen through. Even if they look small, don't take the chance! Start by washing the cracks with hot water, disinfectant, and rubbing alcohol.
