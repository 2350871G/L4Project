          "description":"The only difference between most door seals is the shape of the insert that slides into the frame of your door. Unfortunately, this piece is hidden in the slot it is fitted into. To remove a piece, pull out a small 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) piece of the rubber seal by pulling it out of the slot. Cut the piece using a pair of scissors. Inspect the shape of the fitting to determine what you need to look for. Don\u2019t remove the entire seal. Your home will be exposed to the air outside if you do. Removing a small section isn\u2019t a big deal unless it\u2019s freezing outside, though. On some seals, this piece is T-shaped. On others, it may be angled, round, or have 2 parallel connecting slots. This shape must match your door frame\u2019s opening for a proper seal. Some door seals are flat and use adhesive to grip the frame. If the rubber seal is glued to the door, use a utility knife to peel a portion out."

          "headline":"Measure your door if it\u2019s irregularly sized and check the thickness of the seal.",
          "description":"Rubber door seals are only found on exterior doors, and most exterior doors are 36 by 80 inches (91 by 203 cm). This means that you only need to measure your door to find a replacement seal if your door is custom-made or has an irregular shape. To measure your door, get a measuring tape and measure the height and width of your door. Write these numbers down, add them together, and multiply the sum by 2 to determine the length of the seal you need. Measure the thickness of the seal so you know how big your replacement needs to be. For example, if your door is 90 inches (230 cm) tall and 40 inches (100 cm) wide, you need a seal that is at least 260 inches (660 cm) in length. You can usually cut rubber seals with scissors, so you can simply buy a long length of rubber seal and cut it to size later if you don\u2019t want to mess around with a measuring tape. You don\u2019t need to worry about the thickness of the door itself."

          "description":"Since the rubber seals used for uPVC doors come in a variety of styles, the easiest way to get a replacement seal is to contact your door\u2019s manufacturer directly. Look up the number for your door\u2019s manufacturer online and call them. Explain that you need a replacement rubber seal or gasket and provide the dimensions of your door and the shape of your seal. Pay for the piece over the phone or follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to buy a replacement from their website.Tip: Unless there\u2019s a sticker somewhere on your door, the only real way to know who manufactured your door is to ask the contractors that installed it. You may need to pay for shipping, but the rubber seal itself should only cost $4-10. If your door is custom-made or uniquely shaped, it may cost a little more. Most hardware and home supply stores do not carry replacement rubber seals, so you\u2019ll need to buy it online."

Once you find a seal that matches your original seal, purchase a replacement online. When looking at a potential replacement, make sure that it\u2019s long enough to fit around your door and thick enough to slide into the slot. While it\u2019s easier to replace your door seal with a seal made by the same company that manufactured your door, a seal made by a different company will fit so long as the slot on the frame matches the shape of the seal. There are only 5-10 different seal fittings, so you shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble finding a replacement. Even if you do make a mistake, you\u2019ll only lose a few dollars if you get it wrong."
