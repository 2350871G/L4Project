    "If you miss the stud and shoot the nail only through drywall, the siding will likely fall off of the wall in a couple of days.",
    "At this point, you can remove the nickels that you set between the 2 boards.",
    "Pry them out with a butter knife or pencil, and set them on top of the board you just installed, in anticipation of installing subsequent boards.",
    "Repeat this process with the rest of your shiplap siding.",
    "Measure and cut each board, then place the new board on top of (or below) the piece of siding you\u2019ve just installed.",
    "Use the nickels to space out each board from the one below it.",
    "Always use 2 nails or screws to attach each board to the stud, and make sure that they penetrate the studs.",
    "If you\u2019re staggering your shiplap, be aware that the spot where the staggered boards butt together will not be the same from level to level.",
    "If 1 board sticks out more than another and the meeting place is not on a stud, you can place a small piece of wood behind the 2 boards where they meet.",
    "Screw both butt ends to the piece of wood with finish screws to make them level and even with each other.",
    "Once you\u2019ve installed the final siding board, you can use a damp rag to wipe off any remaining chalk lines above the shiplap.",
    "Apply caulk around the edges of the shiplap.",
    "Using a silicone caulk (in a metal caulk gun), run a thin layer of caulk along both the right- and left-hand edges of the shiplap that you\u2019ve installed.",
    "This will seal the edges of the planks and keep the watertight, and prevent drafts or leaks from coming through the shiplap.",
    "If you chose to stagger shiplap boards, run a link of caulk along the seams where the 2 staggered boards meet.",
    "You can also cover the nail or screw holes with putty that matches the color of the wood (or paint).",
    "Both caulk and putty can be found at any local hardware store."
