The phase of the moon depends upon the way in which the moon is positioned in relation to the sun and earth at any given time.

If you place the sun to the left of the earth, you would have to move all of the moon phases to match this new position. The relationship of these three bodies is important, but the actual determination of right or left side is arbitrary. The earth orbits the sun and the sun is never at a stationary \u201cleft or right\u201d in relation to the earth."

This moon phase occurs when the moon has moved through roughly \u215b of its orbit (less than three days after the new moon). At this point in the orbit, there is a sliver of the moon that is lit by the sun\u2019s light, and visible to the side of the earth experiencing night (pointing away from the sun). The crescent phase is often associated with struggle and growth in astrology. It is thought to be a good time to take opportunities."

When the moon appears as a half circle in the sky, this is known as a quarter moon because the moon has moved through \u00bc of its orbit. This moon phase can be observed around seven to ten days into the moon\u2019s cycle. Astrological themes surrounding the first quarter phase are action and expression. It is considered a good time to take the first steps to communicate your goals and achieve them."

During this phase, the moon moves closer and closer to being a full circle in the sky. The waxing gibbous is observed from roughly eleven to fourteen days into the moon cycle. During the waxing gibbous phase, astrologists suggest that you focus on analyzing the results of the actions that you initiated in the first quarter phase."

The placement of the full moon on your chart should be 180 degrees from the new moon (straight across from the new moon on the other side of the earth). Astrologically, the full moon represents illumination. During this phase, it is thought that one will have a clear view of their previous actions so that they can make appropriate adjustments."

Stages of the waning gibbous appear to be inverted from stages of the waxing gibbous. The parts of the moon that were dark at a given phase of the waxing gibbous will be light at a similar phase of the waning gibbous and vice versa. In astrology, the waning gibbous is also referred to as the disseminating moon. It is considered a time to reflect upon any changes made during the full moon phase."

This phase marks the point at which the moon has traveled through \u00be of its orbit. The third quarter moon, or last quarter moon, is considered a time for revising and cleansing by astrologists.

For example:\nNew moon: This is the beginning of the moon phases when the moon is hidden from sight. Waxing crescent: This is the sliver of a crescent when the moon begins to be visible. First quarter: Appears as a half circle in the sky. Waxing gibbous: More than half of a circle is illuminated as the moon moves toward a full moon. Full moon: The entire moon appears lit up by the sun, so you can see a whole circle. Waxing gibbous: The illumination of the moon starts to shrink again.
