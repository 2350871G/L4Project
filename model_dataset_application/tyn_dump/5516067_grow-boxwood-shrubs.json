    "Dig a hole for each plant that is as deep as the root ball.",
    "The root ball is the part of the shrub that contains all the roots, and it most often is completely contained within the container the shrub was sold in, though it might be a little smaller than the container itself.",
    "Most often, you\u2019ll need to dig about 1 foot (12 in) down into the soil.",
    "When the shrub is actually planted, the soil should be even with the top of the root ball.",
    "Make the hole 1 to 2 feet (12 to 24 in) wide for each shrub.",
    "Use your spade or a small shovel to unearth the ground surrounding each hole.",
    "Set the dirt off to the side, as it\u2019ll get replaced after the shrub has been planted.",
    "It\u2019s important that the roots have somewhere to grow, and loosening the soil around each plant will make it easier for the roots to spread.",
    "Break open or cut the root ball so the roots can spread more easily.",
    "Remove the shrub from its container.",
    "Use a razor blade or some other sharp instrument and cut into the root ball multiple times around each side.",
    "This simply loosens the root ball so that it\u2019ll be easier for the actual roots to spread out.",
    "Depending on how loose the soil is in the root ball, you may also be able to just use your hands to loosen the soil so that some of the roots are hanging free.",
    "Tamp the soil around each plant so that the root ball gets set into the ground.",
    "Set each shrub into its designated hole and fill in the space around it with the previously removed dirt.",
    "Position the plant so that the top of the root ball is even with the surface of the ground.",
    "Once the plants are all in place, use your spade to firmly press down on the soil all around each plant.",
    "Tamping helps secure the soil so it isn\u2019t loose around the root ball, which means it\u2019ll be less likely to blow away in the wind or get washed away when you water the shrubs.",
    "Water the plants thoroughly after planting them so they can grow strong.",
    "Give each shrub enough water that the topsoil is completely saturated.",
    "This water will seep down through the soil and the root ball and help them join together even more, encouraging the roots to spread out and start growing in the ground.",
    "For the next week, keep an eye on the soil and give the shrubs more water if the soil looks dry.",
    "Caring for Your Boxwood Shrubs Water your plants every 2 weeks if there hasn\u2019t been regular rainfall.",
    "Especially within the first 2 years, it\u2019s important to keep the soil around the plant moist.",
    "This will help it develop really strong roots and grow well.",
    "If there is regular rainfall, you most likely won\u2019t need to give your shrubs any additional water.",
    "If you notice brown or yellow leaves, that means you need to water the plant more often.",
    "Check the soil by sticking a finger into it about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm).",
    "If the soil is dry, water the plants.",
    "If the soil is damp, you can wait a few more days.",
    "Give your shrubs about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of mulch each summer.",
    "Start the mulch about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the root, as you don\u2019t want to cover the actual root with mulch.",
    "Spread it out about 12 inches (30 cm) around each shrub.",
    "The mulch helps to keep the roots cool during the warmer summer months.Tip: For the best results, use a fine-textured mulch for your shrubs.",
    "Look for one that contains peat moss, grass clippings, and sawdust.",
    "Fertilize your shrubs in the early spring and late winter.",
    "Apply the fertilizer to just the ground around the roots of the plant so it\u2019s about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick.",
    "Take care that it doesn\u2019t come into contact with the leaves.",
    "After the shrub has been fertilized, water it thoroughly.",
    "Use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer.",
    "Look for one with an N-P-K (nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium) ratio of 4-1-1, 3-1-1, or 3-1-2.",
    "You can find fertilizer at your local garden center or nursery.",
    "Prune your boxwood shrubs between the last spring frost and the first winter frost.",
    "Use sharp, clean shears to trim away dead or leggy branches.",
    "Cut away any branches that are growing down toward the ground to help the shrub keeps its shape.",
    "You can also prune the shrubs during the growing season, especially if it is growing a lot and getting out of shape.",
    "Treat diseases and drive away pests to keep your shrubs healthy.",
    "If you notice branches with brown or mildew-covered spots, cut them away.",
    "Depending on what\u2019s wrong with your shrub, you may be able to use a fungicide or pesticide to help clear up the problem.",
    "When in doubt, ask a professional at your local garden center for help.",
    "Some of the more common diseases and pests you might encounter are:\nBoxwood blight\nLeaf spot\nPowdery mildew\nBoxwood psyllid\nLeafminers\nSpider mites"
