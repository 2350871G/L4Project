          "headline":"Lay the wax paper underneath the fabric.",
          "description":"Take your chosen fabric and place wax paper underneath it to protect the surface you are working on. Lay the wax paper and the fabric down on a flat, high surface, such as a table. Make sure the wax paper lines the fabric so no glue or paint gets on the surface you are working on."

          "headline":"Create a design on the fabric with the liquid glue.",
          "description":"Use clear glue that is washable. Hold the glue steady as you draw out designs on the fabric. You may do a pattern with lines, circles, spirals, or shapes. Or you may try a chevron or floral pattern. The design you make with the glue will be the design that is resist printed onto the fabric. Do not let the glue get too thick on the fabric. Try not to use too much glue on the fabric, as this can lead to a blurry design."

        {
          "headline":"Paint the fabric.",
          "description":"Lay out the fabric with the glue designs and put out craft paints and paint brushes. Pick out colors that you think will look good with the designs. Then, brush the paint right over the glue, onto the fabric. Cover the entire piece of fabric with paint, creating a background color for the glue designs. Blend colors if you\u2019d like or use just one color. Get creative and paint the designs as you see fit. Use acrylic or water based paints for the designs. Avoid using oil based paints, as they will not dry well. Try not to layer on the paint too thickly over the glue, as this can distort the design. Stick with one to two light coats of paint on the fabric."

        {
          "headline":"Allow the paint to dry.",
          "description":"Giving the paint time to dry will make it easier for you to rinse off the glue later. Determine the drying time based on how you want the colors to appear. If you want the paint colors to appear darker on the fabric, you should let the fabric dry for longer. If you want the paint colors to appear more subdued, let them dry until they are damp to the touch. Then, rinse them off while they are still slightly wet."

It may feel a bit slimy but that\u2019s okay, that is to be expected. Rinse until the glue slides off the fabric. Do not rub or scrub at the fabric, as this can damage it. Instead, let the glue melt and slide off on its own."

You can also make fun shapes or patterns on the wax with tools like a potato masher, a chopstick, or any other object with an interesting texture. Make sure the wax appears clear on the fabric and has penetrated the other side of the fabric.

The lightest color will show up on the waxed areas and the darker color will be the main color on the fabric. For example, you may start with yellow dye as the first dye bath.

    "This way, the fabric will not move around or shift while you are printing.",
    "You can use a wooden table to stretch the fabric over and secure it with tape or staples.",
    "Make sure the fabric is taut over the table and does not move around.",
    "For more support under the fabric, you can layer carpet or foam over the table and then place the fabric over these layers.",
    "Secure the fabric well with tape, staples, or pins.",
    "Soak the sponge in the fabric paint or dye.",
    "Squeeze the fabric paint or dye into a bowl.",
    "Then, soak the sponge in it so the dye covers one side of the sponge.",
    "Make sure one side of the sponge is covered with the paint or dye.",
    "If you are using natural dyes that can stain your fingers, wear gloves to prevent this.",
    "Another option is to take a paint brush and paint the dye over the sponge to cover it.",
    "Press the printing block into the sponge.",
    "Make sure the color covers the entire printing block.",
    "Press the sponge onto the block as many times as needed to get dye on the printing block.",
    "You can buy printing blocks online or in craft stores.",
    "Look for printing blocks made of wood or rubber.",
    "Apply the printing block to the fabric.",
    "Hold the printing block with your fingertips and press it firmly onto the fabric.",
    "Use your palm or your fingers to apply even pressure.",
    "Hold the block on the fabric for a few seconds and then carefully remove it.",
    "Sponge dye onto the same printing block and press it on a new spot on the fabric to create a pattern.",
    "Or use a different colored dye on the same printing block.",
    "Make sure you wash the printing block between colors so the dyes do not mix.",
    "You can also apply different print blocks on the same piece of fabric.",
    "Get creative and make up your own patterns or designs.",
    "Let the fabric dry.",
    "Once you have done as many print blocks as you\u2019d like, let the fabric dry overnight.",
    "Put it in a safe flat area where it will not be touched.",
    "Iron or rinse the fabric to set it.",
    "If you used textile paints to do the block printing, iron the fabric on the reverse side to set the print.",
    "If you used natural dyes for the block printing, iron on the reverse side and rinse the fabric in warm and then cold water with detergent."
