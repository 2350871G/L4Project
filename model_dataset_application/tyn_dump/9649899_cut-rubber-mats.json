For most efficient results, keep moving from one end of the mat to the other, rather than separating a single section at a time. That way, the whole strip will come away in one piece.

This means you\u2019ll be able to make modifications to the material in areas that would otherwise present a problem. When properly trimmed, rubber mats will lay perfectly around corners, columns, alcoves, and other tricky spots.
