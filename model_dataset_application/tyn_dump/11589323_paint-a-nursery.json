Since babies and pregnant women are more sensitive to these compounds, look for paint that has low-VOC levels or none at all. Ask the paint desk if they also have low or no-VOC paint colorant that they'll use to mix the paint."

Instead, work with an eggshell sheen to give a little depth and shine to the walls. Eggshell sheen paint is also easy to wipe down. If you prefer an even shinier look, you could try satin sheen paint."

Let the paint dry completely before you determine whether or not you like the paint. If you can't paint test spots on the wall, tape the color chip on the wall so you can get an idea of how the paint will look. Keep in mind that painting on the wall is preferable since the spot will more accurately reflect the light in the nursery."

          "description":"If your home was built before 1978, it's a good idea to test the paint for lead. You can buy a simple lead testing kit from a hardware store or online. Use a utility knife to carefully scrape down to the first layer of paint on the wall and rub the end of the tester on the paint. Then, read the results according to the kit manufacturer.Tip: If the paint on the wall tests positive for lead, hire a professional to remove it or paint the room. If you're pregnant, it's not safe for you to handle anything that tests positive for lead. Most lead testing kits will include a testing sheet. You'll rub the tester onto the sheet after testing the wall to ensure that your kit worked."
