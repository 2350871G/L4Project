          "description":"Depending on your taste and on the kind of burgers you want to make, the variety of add-ins, spices, and combinations you use to season them is almost endless. You can add different spices at different points in the making of the burgers, but one thing is always necessary: salt. Just before you put your burgers on the grill or on the stove, season both sides with a generous portion of kosher salt. Salt dissolves muscle proteins, drawing out water. Adding salt into the raw hamburger before you form the patties will result in tough and dry burgers, losing much of the flavor and texture associated with a good one. However you end up cooking your burgers, wait to salt them, and salt them on the outside."

          "description":"If you're in search of more delicious seasoning options because your burgers tend toward the dry and flavorless, it may be because you're over handling the meat. It's not important to integrate seasoning into the burgers themselves. Seasoning added to the outside of the meat will make more flavorful burgers. Burgers should be formed quickly, into portions of about 4 oz with a small indent in the middle, with as little fuss as possible, then seasoned before cooking. Don't \"rub\" it. If you want to use the same \"dry rub\" you use on ribs, go for it, but there's no reason to massage it into the meat. Handle the burgers as little as possible."

          "headline":"Use seasoning liberally.",
          "description":"Sprinkle a generous pinch of any dry seasoning you use on your burger patties from several inches above, evenly and liberally. One of the biggest differences between those great burgers at the restaurant and the ones you make at home is the amount of seasoning used on the meat. It takes a lot, more than you're probably using. Ground beef isn't the most flavorful meat on the planet. Even good quality beef patties can have a tendency to be somewhat bland if not seasoned properly. Go big, or you might as well eat a salad instead. Sprinkle on a generous portion of salt and fresh-cracked black pepper, enough that you'll get plenty in each bite."

Why mess with perfection? To make a good burger, get fancy after you've got it off the grill, adding all the toppings and condiments you want. Like raw onion and ranch dressing? Go for it.
