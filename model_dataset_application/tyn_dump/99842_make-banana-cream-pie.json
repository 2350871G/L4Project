  "text":" Preparing the Crust Mix the flour and salt in a medium sized bowl. If you want to save time for the next few steps, place the flour and salt into a food processor. Cut in the shortening and blend until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. You can do this in a food processor fitted steel blades or in a medium sized bowl with a pastry blender. Do not over mix, or the dough will get too soft and mushy. Cut in the butter and blend some more. Again, don't over mix it. The butter, shortening, salt, and flour should just come together. You want the mixture to still resemble coarse crumbs. If you are using a food processor, you can transfer the mixture into a medium sized bowl once you mix the butter in. Add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough stops clinging to the side of the bowl. Gently toss the dough while you add the water. The dough should just barely come together. If it is too dry, add a little bit more water, until it does. Don't worry if it looks too dry; it will dampen once you put it in the fridge. Transfer the mixture onto a flat surface, and form it into a flat disk. Scoop the crumbs towards the center, and press them into the dough. Make the disk about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) thick.

Wrap the disk with some parchment paper, wax paper, or plastic wrap. This will help the dough keep its disk shape. It will also trap moisture and keep it from drying it. Place the packet into the fridge and leave it there for 30 minutes. This will give the flour enough time to soak up the water and become softer. Baking the Crust Pre-heat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190.56\u00b0C).  Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it out into a disk on a lightly floured surface. Unwrap the dough first, then lightly flour a flat, smooth surface. Place the dough onto the surface. Roll the dough out to a 11 to 12 inch (27.94 to 30.48 centimeters) circle. This will be big enough for a 9 inch (22.86 centimeters) pie pan. You are making the crust larger so that it can fit inside the pan.

Do not take the crust out of the pan. Making the Filling Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan. There is no need to use any heat just yet. Gradually whisk in the half-and-half. Do not pour it in all at once. Instead, slowly pour it into the mixture while you stir with a whisk. If you don't have any half-and-half, you can use heavy cream instead Separate the egg yolks from the whites, and stir them in.

Your pie filling is now done and ready to use. Don't worry if it looks a little thin. You will need to refrigerate the entire pie after you put it together. This will \"set\" the filling and make it thicker. Putting the Pie Together Peel and slice up 2 bananas. You want the slices to be thin, about \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) thick. Plan on having another extra banana so that you can slice it up and use it to decorate the pie with. Do not pre-slice this \"decorating\" banana, however, or it will turn brown. Fill the bottom of the pie crust the with sliced bananas. To get the most out of your sliced bananas, place the slices down flat, one by one. Don't just dump them all in. This will give you a 2-layer pie. If you want a 3-layer pie, fill the bottom of crust part way with the pie filling first. Spread a thin layer of sliced bananas on top of the mixture. Fill the crust the rest of the way with the remaining pie pilling. Fill the crust with the pie filling. You may need to use a spoon or spatula to help guide the filling into the crust. Keep adding the filling until it just reaches the top of the crust. If you run out of pie filling, don't fret. You can always top the pie off with more sliced bananas and whipped cream. Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the filling. The plastic wrap will keep the pie from forming a \"skin\" on top. Refrigerate the pie 3 to 6 hours, then remove the plastic wrap.
