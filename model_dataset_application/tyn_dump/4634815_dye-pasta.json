Make the plastic baggies fairly full, with 1-2 cups (100-200 grams) of dried pasta in each one. Be sure to leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of headspace so you can move the pasta around and distribute the food coloring. Freezer bags are ideal because they seal tightly and are heavy-duty.

The ratio is approximately .25 cups (59 ml) of rubbing alcohol for every 1-2 cups (100-200 grams) of dried pasta. It\u2019s best to work with one bag at a time and complete the process before moving on to the next bag/color. If possible, use isopropyl alcohol with 70% concentration. Higher concentrations may cause stickiness and be harder to blend. You can substitute distilled white vinegar if you don\u2019t want to use alcohol. Use 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of white vinegar."

You can use any color you want and even experiment with mixing colors to create new ones. For example, mixing blue and red food coloring will result in purple dye.
