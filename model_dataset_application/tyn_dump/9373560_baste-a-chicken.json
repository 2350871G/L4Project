It\u2019s best to roast your bird in a roasting pan rather than on a baking sheet, since its juices may spill onto the floor of the oven. If your recipe calls for roasting vegetables in the same pan as the chicken, roast them in a separate pan so they don\u2019t get overcooked by the basting liquid. Chickens will typically take 20 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) plus an additional 15 minutes of total roasting time to cook through. The chicken is ready when the internal temperature reaches at least 165\u00b0 F (74\u00b0 C) with a meat thermometer."

  "text":" Using a Turkey Baster Follow your favorite roast chicken recipe until it's time to roast. Place the chicken in the oven at the temperature called for by your recipe. It\u2019s best to roast your bird in a roasting pan rather than on a baking sheet, since its juices may spill onto the floor of the oven. If your recipe calls for roasting vegetables in the same pan as the chicken, roast them in a separate pan so they don\u2019t get overcooked by the basting liquid. Chickens will typically take 20 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) plus an additional 15 minutes of total roasting time to cook through. The chicken is ready when the internal temperature reaches at least 165\u00b0 F (74\u00b0 C) with a meat thermometer. Melt 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup or 110 g) in the microwave. Unwrap 1 stick  of butter (1/2 cup or 110 g) and place it in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the butter in 15-second intervals until it is fully melted. Because it takes a little time for your chicken to begin rendering its own fat into the pan, you will baste with just butter to begin with. Remove your roasting pan from the oven 30 minutes into the roast. Set your pan on a heat-safe surface, such as the top of the stove. Close the oven door to make sure the oven stays hot. Have your melted butter and a turkey baster nearby. Perform your first baste. Being careful near the hot roasting pan, squeeze the bulb of the baster while the tip is submerged in the melted butter.

Place the hot roasting pan back in the oven. Wear oven mitts to protect your hands as you place the roasting pan back in the oven. Set a timer for 30 minutes. Perform the second baste when the timer goes off. After removing your chicken from the oven, dip the tip of the baster into the rendered chicken fat at the bottom of the roasting pan. Suck this liquid up into the baster, and use it to coat the chicken completely. Repeat as necessary. After coating, place the chicken back in the oven. Be careful not to touch the tube of the baster when it is full of hot liquid. You can burn yourself. Baste the chicken every 30 minutes until it is fully cooked. When you think your chicken is done, use an ovenproof meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of your chicken.

If you are basting chicken parts in the oven rather than a whole chicken, baste every 15-20 minutes rather than every 30 minutes. Remove your chicken from the oven. When your chicken has reached the right temperature, tent the chicken in foil and let it rest for 10 minutes in the roasting pan. Move it to a cutting board with kitchen tongs. Carve the chicken and serve. Trying Alternate Basting Methods Use a basting brush. Try using a basting brush to coat your chicken instead of a turkey baster. Dip the bristles of the brush into your melted butter or rendered fat and paint the chicken with the liquid, coating it completely. Perform the baste every 30 minutes. Make sure your basting brush has bristles made of a heat-safe material, such as silicone. If it doesn\u2019t, it may be a pastry brush, which is not meant to be used at high heat.

There is no need to open the oven to re-baste. The cheesecloth will do the work for you. Remove and discard the layer of cheesecloth before serving your chicken. Roast your chicken breast-side down.

Kitchen tongs can help you flip your hot chicken without hurting yourself. Always take care around the hot pan! Starting the chicken breast-side down enables the fat-rich dark meat in the thighs and legs to drip down over the leaner meat, basting it. Basting a Chicken on the Grill Heat the grill.
