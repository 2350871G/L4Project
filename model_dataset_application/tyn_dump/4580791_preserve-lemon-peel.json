If you want, juice the cut lemons right away. See Making and Freezing Lemon Juice, below. Freezing Fresh Lemon Peel Using a citrus zester, shave off lemon peel from lemon. A zester is a great tool for peeling only the exocarp (outside layer of the lemon's skin), and comes with several sizes. Use lemon fruit for juice and piths for pectin. See Making and Freezing Lemon Juice, below. Place lemon zest in a glass mason jar and freeze. Placing the portions in a glass mason jar, rather than a plastic bag, will ensure that the small portions are not crushed or crumbled in the freezer. Dry Preserving Lemon Peel Using a potato peeler, cut off lemon peel in wide ribbons. Larger strips of peel work better for dry preserving. Use the remaining lemon fruit for juice.

You can either use a sharp potato peeler for large ribbons of zest for use in cocktails or to infuse olive oil or a citrus zester for smaller pieces of zest for use in cooking and baking. Place zested half-lemon in lemon squeezer and juice. Depending on your preferred method of lemon squeezing, you may end up with pithy juice with seeds or fibers. Filter lemon juice at least once.
