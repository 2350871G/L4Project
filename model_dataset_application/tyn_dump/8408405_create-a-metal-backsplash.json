          "description":"It's important to do this before anything else. Knowing the area you need your backsplash to cover will allow you to calculate the cost of materials, which could influence the kind of metal you use. To calculate the dimensions for your backsplash:\nDivide the wall where you plan on installing the backsplash evenly into rectangles to account for cabinets, windows, large appliances and so on. Measure the height and the width of each rectangle. Multiply these numbers together to find the area of each. If you have a diagonal angle to account for, extend the base of the diagonal horizontally until it is even with the top of the diagonal. Connect the horizontal extension and the top of the diagonal to make a right triangle. Calculate the area of triangles by multiplying the base and height of the triangle, then divide that number by 2 (triangle area = (base x height) / 2 ). Add together the area calculations to get the total area in units squared (for example, in\u00b2, ft\u00b2, cm\u00b2, m\u00b2). Multiply this number by 1.1 so you have extra backsplash material to fill in gaps or replace materials damaged during installation."

          "description":"Now that you know the total area needed for your backsplash, you can begin shopping around. You can get quotes for backsplash material at your local big box hardware store (like Lowes, Home Depot, and Home Hardware) or online. An online backsplash provider may be the easiest option for getting a quote. In many cases, once you choose a backsplash material, you only need to input the total area on the site to determine the cost. Before ordering your backsplash online, verify the seller's return policy. If tile is damaged during shipping, you may end up with an expensive and unusable backsplash. Common backsplash metals include:\n\nCopper, which is lightweight. This makes it easier to install. Copper works well with rustic and retro designs. Stainless steel, which comes in many shades. It is durable and is easy to maintain. It works well with modern decor. Brass, which requires higher maintenance to prevent rust and keep clean.However, this metal has a unique, classical appearance."

Some fixtures you might have to remove include light/disposal switches, cover plates for outlets, and so on. Turn off all electricity to your kitchen before installation.
