Citrus fruit can release plenty of bitter oils when muddled with prolonged force. This can work well in sugary drinks such as the caipirinha or mojito. Use a lighter touch when muddling for drinks with no added sugar. Cucumbers are ready after six or seven gentle presses. Press berries and other soft fruits until pulverized."
