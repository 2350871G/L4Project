Square and rectangular pans will display three separate measurements\u2014one for length, one for width, and another for depth. Round pans will only list the diameter, or the distance from one edge to the other, and the depth.If you don\u2019t see any dimensions listed on your cake pan, you may need to measure your cake by hand. For square or rectangular cakes, simply stretch a ruler or tape measure along the vertical and horizontal edges. To measure a round cake, you just need to find its diameter."

          "description":"Before you get started, dust your countertop with powdered sugar or cornstarch to discourage sticking. Then, grab a handful of fondant, plop it down, and go over it with a rolling pin until it begins to take shape. After every few passes, lift and rotate the fondant to make sure that it\u2019s not clinging to your work surface.The size of the fondant ball you start with will depend on the size of the cake you\u2019re decorating. It\u2019s better to use too much than too little, as you can always trim the excess later on. If you don\u2019t own a rolling pin, a wine bottle, drinking glass, or large water bottle or thermos will also do the trick. It\u2019s also possible to roll fondant between two sheets of wax or parchment paper if you\u2019re worried about sticking."

    "With one hand, press the center of the sheet against the side of the cake and gently rub it from top to bottom until it sticks.",
    "Use your other hand to steady the upper edge of the sheet and make sure it doesn\u2019t fall over.Placing your cake on a pedestal or similar raised dish can make it easier to align the bottom of the strip with the bottom of the cake.",
    "To avoid leaving behind unsightly depressions, smooth the fondant with the flat of your hand rather than your fingers.",
    "Unravel the fondant to transfer it to the cake with minimal effort.",
    "Twist the dowel slowly with one hand while moving your other hand along the rolled fondant to help guide it into place.",
    "When you return to your original starting point, smooth the icing all the way around with your palms to secure it.Use a delicate touch here.",
    "If you tear the fondant, you may have no choice but to re-roll it and start over.",
    "Trim any excess fondant from around the top of the cake.",
    "Push the tip of a sharp knife through the icing just above the cake\u2019s upper surface and run the blade smoothly around the exterior, pulling the fondant taut with your free hand at the same time.",
    "Afterwards, go over the seams on the top and side of the cake with your fondant smoother or the pad of one finger until they gradually disappear.To ensure that your cuts are as clean as possible, it may help to pause and rotate the cake every so often, or move around it yourself, if space allows.",
    "If the piece also turned out a little too wide, you may need to shave off the excess material where the two ends overlap, as well.",
    "Covering Tall Cakes for Storage Invest in an extra-tall cake keeper for simpler, more convenient storage.",
    "Cake keepers come in a variety of sizes, some of which range from 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) in height.",
    "One of these handy storage accessories should provide adequate clearance for all but the most colossal cakes.",
    "Just make sure the cake keeper you\u2019re using is roomy enough to comfortably contain your cake without rubbing up against the sides.",
    "Most culinary supply stores offer a good selection of cake keepers and serving domes.",
    "If you don\u2019t find the size you need, check online.Tip: If you plan on bringing your cake to a party or other event, look for a cake carrier with a locking lid and built-in handle for ease of transport.",
    "Place a large container over your cake to create a protective dome.",
    "An upended mixing bowl, bucket, washtub, or plastic storage container could potentially double as a makeshift cake shield in a pinch.",
    "A sturdy container will not only keep freshly-frosted cakes off-limits to dust, pet hair, and other drifting debris, but also safeguard them from being squashed if something happens to fall on them while they\u2019re sitting out.If you decide to go the thrifty route and repurpose another type of container, be sure to clean it thoroughly before putting it to its new use.",
    "It\u2019s also a good idea to label your container so that other people will know not to move it or otherwise mess with it.",
    "Wrap sliced cakes with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.",
    "Stretch out a sheet of foil or plastic until it\u2019s a little more than twice the height of the cake.",
    "Stick one end to the lower edge of the dish that your cake is resting on.",
    "Carefully drape the remaining material over the cake and secure the opposite end to the far side of the dish.",
    "Repeat this process with as many pieces as it takes to cover the cake completely.Stab a few toothpicks into the top of your cake prior to wrapping it.",
    "This will cause the foil or plastic to form a \u201ctent,\u201d minimizing sticking and smudging.",
    "A little plastic or foil will be your best bet if you\u2019ve already sliced your cake or need to store it temporarily but don\u2019t have a suitably-sized container on hand.",
    "Refrigerate your cake if you need it to keep for longer than 3-4 days.",
    "Seal up your cake with a few sheets of plastic wrap and make some room for it on your fridge's bottom shelf, where it can sit undisturbed until you're ready to serve it.",
    "When properly refrigerated, most kinds of cakes will retain their original flavor and texture for up to a week\u2014about twice as long as those stored at room temperature.Finding room for multi-tiered cakes may prove challenging.",
    "If you think you might need to refrigerate a cake that you haven't yet frosted, it may be easiest to wrap and put away the undecorated layers separately and assemble them just before your dinner or event.",
    "It will be especially important to keep your cake cool if either it or its surrounding layer of frosting contains perishable ingredients like eggs, milk, cream, or cream cheese."
