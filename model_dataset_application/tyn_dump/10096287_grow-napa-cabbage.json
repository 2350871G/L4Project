If you plant in mid- to late summer, the plants will mature as the temperatures are dropping. Prepare the soil in winter for a spring planting or mid-summer for a fall planting. If you're planting in spring, generally, you'll plant after the last estimated frost. Many local gardening sites will list the last estimated frost for your area. Napa cabbage can survive a light frost in the 30 to 32 \u00b0F (\u22121 to 0 \u00b0C) range, but not a heavy frost. Plant 70-80 days ahead of when the first major frosts are expected in your area."

Pick a location in your yard where it can receive sun most of the day (6 hours or more). If you live in a warmer climate, partial sun is better. However, your cabbages should still get about 6 hours of sun a day. Napa cabbage prefers temperatures in the 50 to 80 \u00b0F (10 to 27 \u00b0C) range, particularly during germination."
