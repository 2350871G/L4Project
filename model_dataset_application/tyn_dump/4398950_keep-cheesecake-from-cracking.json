Greasing the pan encourages the cheesecake to pull away from the sides and shrink in. You can use cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening to grease the pan. As a general rule, the sides and bottom of the pan should appear glossy and feel greasy to the touch, but they should not be dripping wet. Use a clean paper towel to spread the shortening, spray, or butter around the sides of the pan evenly."

Over-mixing the batter can cause air bubbles to get trapped inside, and these air bubbles are ultimately the main cause of cracks. Inside the oven, the air bubbles created in the batter expand and try to escape. They move to the top of the cheesecake, creating a crack or indentation as they break free."

          "description":"Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) to 1/4 cup (60 ml) of cornstarch or flour to the batter alongside the sugar. Starches minimize the amount of cracking that can occur. The starch molecules get in between the egg proteins and prevent them from over-coagulating. As a result, the cheesecake shrinks less, causing fewer cracks. If you're working with a recipe that already includes flour or cornstarch, however, you may not need to add any extra. The writer of the recipe may have already taken the matter of starch into consideration."

Mix the rest of the ingredients together thoroughly before adding the eggs to reduce the number of trapped air bubbles. Any lumps created by the cream cheese or other ingredients should be completely beaten out before you add the eggs. Mix the batter as little as possible after you add the eggs."

          "description":"A warm water bath keeps the moisture in the oven high, but more importantly, it prevents the cheesecake from getting too hot during the cooking process. To create a warm water bath, first cover the sides and bottom of your cheesecake pan with aluminum foil to provide an extra barrier from the water. Use heavy-duty aluminum foil, if possible, and wrap outside of the pan as securely as possible. Rest the cheesecake pan inside a larger pan. Fill the larger pan with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of warm water, or just enough water to surround half of the depth of the pan."

Extreme temperatures and dramatic temperature changes can cause the cake to crack, but cooking the cheesecake at a fairly low temperature can minimize the risk. You can bake a cheesecake at a lower temperature if the recipe calls for it, but avoid temperatures that are higher than this.

The batter should continue to bake inside the warm oven. Gently baking the cheesecake for the final hour prevents it from over-baking, which is important since over-baking can cause cracks to form."

A cheesecake will always crack if the internal temperature rises above 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) during the baking process. The thermometer will leave a hole in the center of your cheesecake, so you can skip this step if you want a perfectly smooth surface. Many people consider a hole to be far less distracting than surface cracks, though. Since the thermometer will allow you to measure the doneness on a detailed level, it's a valuable tool in the battle against surface cracking and definitely has its benefits."
