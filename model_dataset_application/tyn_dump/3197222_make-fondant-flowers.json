You can use any color fondant you want for your carnation. To prevent the fondant from sticking to the rolling pin or work surface, dust both the surface and the rolling pin with a little cornstarch before you begin, or apply a thin layer of shortening. To change the color of your fondant, squeeze a few drops of gel coloring onto the fondant. Then massage it in, kneading the fondant to spread the color evenly throughout.

Mathew Rice\t\t\tProfessional Baker & Dessert Influencer\t\t\t\tMathew Rice, pastry chef, adds: \"Try using powdered sugar when you roll your fondant out, and don't be afraid to use a lot of it. You can always dust off the excess powdered sugar, but once your fondant sticks to your mat, then you're not in the best position to be able to work with it very well. Then, use a dry pastry brush to the brush off the excess when you\u2019re done.\""

Then make a slightly smaller circle, continuing to decrease the size for each of the remaining 3 pieces. Adjust the diameter of the circles as needed to create smaller or larger flowers. For fuller flowers, cut out more than 5 circles. If you don\u2019t have fondant or cookie cutters, you can use anything that has a circular shape, like the bottom of a drinking glass.

This causes the fondant to curl up into a ruffled edge. Repeat on all 5 circles. Be careful not to press too hard so you don\u2019t cut through the fondant with the toothpick. You just want to make an indentation. Some bakers choose to lay their fondant on a foam shaping mat during this step.

    "Paint designs on the petals with a small paintbrush dipped in food coloring.",
    "Add green fondant leaves to the base of your flower.",
    "Use petals in all different colors for a whimsical effect.",
    "Making Fondant Roses Roll the fondant into a rectangular shape that\u2019s \u20448 in (0.32 cm) thick.",
    "You want the fondant to be thin enough that the flowers don\u2019t look clunky, yet thick enough that it won\u2019t rip when you\u2019re forming the petals.",
    "Use a rolling pin with gentle pressure to evenly spread out the fondant on a flat surface.",
    "Spread a layer of shortening or sprinkle cornstarch onto your surface if you want to prevent the fondant from sticking.",
    "Use pink or red fondant for realistic roses.",
    "However, you can use any color you'd like.",
    "Trim the edges with a knife to create your rectangle, if necessary.",
    "Make Your Own Marshmallow Fondant\nIngredients:1 10 oz (0.28 kg) bag of mini marshmallows2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 ml) of water4 cups (950 ml) of powdered sugar\nDirections:1.",
    "Melt the marshmallows and the water in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds.",
    "2.",
    "Blend the powdered sugar into the marshmallows with an electric mixer or a spoon.",
    "3.",
    "Knead the dough on a flat surface for about 7 minutes until it's shiny and soft.",
    "If it\u2019s too dry, add \u20442 tablespoon (7.4 ml) of water at a time.",
    "4.",
    "Wrap the ball of fondant in plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
    "Cut a strip of fondant that\u2019s 1.5 to 2 in (3.8 to 5.1 cm) wide.",
    "The length of the strip doesn\u2019t matter but the width shouldn\u2019t be more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) or the rose will be too chunky.",
    "A butter knife will be sharp enough to slice through the fondant.",
    "Cut as many strips as you want roses.",
    "Each strip makes 1 rose.",
    "Fold the strip in half lengthwise.",
    "Line up the long edges of the fondant to make sure you fold the piece exactly down the center.",
    "Don\u2019t smash the 2 sides together.",
    "Just rest them on top of each other so you can still see the crease between them.",
    "If you\u2019re having trouble folding the fondant, you may have a piece that\u2019s too thin.",
    "Re-cut a wider strip.",
    "Roll the strip up, pinching the bottom to form a cone shape.",
    "Keep the open edge facing up.",
    "Squeeze the bottom of the folded strip between your thumb and forefinger as you roll so it tapers down into a slight point.",
    "The tighter you roll your strip, the smaller your rose will be.",
    "If you wind up with extra fondant at the bottom, simply pinch it off with your fingers.",
    "Brush a little bit of water along the strip before you begin rolling if you want the rose to hold its shape better.",
    "The water acts as glue.",
    "Set the roses in a room temperature spot to dry for 24 hours.",
    "Don\u2019t use the roses immediately to decorate a cake or they\u2019ll fall apart or become misshapen.",
    "Letting them dry first will harden them into their flower shape.",
    "If you aren\u2019t using your roses right away, store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for no more than 2 weeks.",
    "Creating Fondant Flowers with a Mold Dab cornstarch into each of the molds with a small paintbrush.",
    "The cornstarch will prevent the fondant from sticking to the mold.",
    "Use a brand new paintbrush that hasn\u2019t been used before, so there aren\u2019t any harmful paint chemicals on it.",
    "Be sure to coat every little crevice in the mold.",
    "If there\u2019s a lot of excess cornstarch in the mold, flip it over and tap it gently to remove the extra powder.",
    "Break off a piece of fondant that\u2019s about the same size as your mold.",
    "If you\u2019re using a very small flower mold, you\u2019ll need a smaller piece.",
    "Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not exact; you just need enough fondant to at least fill the mold.",
    "If you want, you can roll the fondant out into the size of your mold.",
    "It may make it easier to press the fondant evenly into the mold later on, but it isn\u2019t necessary.",
    "Press the piece of fondant into the mold, filling it completely.",
    "Use your fingers to firmly push down on the fondant, making sure you get it into every nook and cranny.",
    "It\u2019s okay if your fondant spills out over the mold.",
    "It\u2019s better to overfill it than underfill it.",
    "If your piece of fondant doesn\u2019t fill the entire mold, break off more fondant and press it on top of the original piece.",
    "Shave off any extra fondant from the mold using a knife.",
    "Use a sawing motion to work the knife carefully along the top of the mold, pulling away the excess fondant with your fingers as you go.",
    "This should smooth out the fondant inside the mold.",
    "If you don\u2019t flatten the top of the mold (which will be the bottom of the flower), you\u2019ll have trouble sticking the finished flower to a cake or cupcake.",
    "You can use an icing spatula instead of a knife.",
    "Place the filled molds in the freezer for 20 minutes.",
    "This hardens the fondant so that it\u2019s easier to remove from the molds.",
    "Set the flowers on a shelf where they\u2019ll sit flat and won\u2019t be disturbed.",
    "Set a kitchen timer or use the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time.",
    "Remove the molds from the freezer and pop the flowers out of the mold.",
    "They should come out easily.",
    "Work quickly so that the flowers don\u2019t warm up in the molds, making it more difficult to get them out cleanly.",
    "Be careful with the flowers when you\u2019re removing them.",
    "They aren\u2019t completely dry yet, so too much force could alter their shape.",
    "If the fondant won\u2019t come out of the mold, leave it in for a little longer before trying again.",
    "Let the flowers dry for at least 24 hours.",
    "Set the flowers in a room temperature spot to harden.",
    "If it\u2019s too warm, the fondant won\u2019t dry as well, or the flowers will lose their shape.",
    "Keep any flowers you aren\u2019t using immediately in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
    "How to Attach Fondant Flowers to a Cake\nWater: Brush a dab of water onto the back of the flower to stick it on.",
    "Sugar glue: Melt a little bit of marshmallow fondant with water to create a glue-like paste.",
    "Shortening: Rub a thin layer onto the cake or cookie before placing your flower on top."
