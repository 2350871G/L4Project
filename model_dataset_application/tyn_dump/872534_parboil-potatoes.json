It's not sprouting and doesn't have any green coloration \u2013 this indicates that it is starting to produce toxins and could have an undesirable taste and even lead to headaches or diarrhea. Be wary of potatoes with soft spots or blemishes, too. As for the type of potato, that's ultimately up to you. There are waxy potatoes, starchy potatoes, and all-purpose potatoes. Waxy potatoes (Rose Finn Apple, Russian Banana, Red Thumb) hold their shape better and are great for boiling or roasting. Starchy potatoes (Russet, Jewel Yam, Japanese Sweet Potato) are great for baking and frying."

If they do need peeled, with your potato peeler or a sharp knife (be careful! ), peel them above a bowl or the trash. This makes clean up a lot easier. Wash them after peeling for good measure."
