These wreaths typically come in green, and are made up of four rings connected by vertical bars. You can get them in the floral department at an arts and crafts store. What size you get is entirely up to you! Choose a 2\u00bd to 6-inch (6.35 to 15.24-centimeter) wide, wired ribbon. Deco mesh ribbon is the most popular, but you can also use burlap, sheer, or satin ribbon. Make sure that the ribbon is wired. Tie the end of the ribbon to the smallest ring on the back of the wreath. Flip the wreath frame over so that the curved side is facing down. Thread the end of your ribbon under the smallest, inner ring on the wreath. Tie the end of the ribbon to the rest of the ribbon in a tight knot. Make sure that you are tying the ribbon next to one of the vertical bars on your wreath. Flip the wreath over and learn the ring pattern. Your wreath frame has four rings. Starting from the smallest ring on the inside, they will be referred to as the first, second, third, and fourth rings. Pull a loop of ribbon between the first and second rings. You can make the loop as big or small as you want. About two-finger-widths would be ideal, however. Also, make sure that the loop is oriented horizontally so that it is parallel to the rings. If it isn't, simply twist it so that it is. Pull loops of ribbon between the next sets of rings until you reach the outside.
