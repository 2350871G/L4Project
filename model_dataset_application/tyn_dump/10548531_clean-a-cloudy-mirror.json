  "text":" Cleaning with Rubbing Alcohol Pour rubbing alcohol into a dish and get out cotton pads. Get out a small bowl or dish and pour about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of rubbing alcohol into it. You'll also need cotton pads or large cotton balls. Avoid using paper towels to clean the mirror since they'll leave lint on the surface of the mirror.
