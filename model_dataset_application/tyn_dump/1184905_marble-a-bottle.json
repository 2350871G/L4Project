Keep in mind that you can always add more paint to the bottle after the first layer dries. Choose the colors with care. They will blend together in some areas. Contrasting colors look great next to each other, but they also make brown when mixed. For instance, you may choose to use blue, white, and purple, or red, yellow, and white."
