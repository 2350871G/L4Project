Instead, hold the bobbin in one hand and use the other hand to wind the elastic thread around the bobbin. You should stretch the thread slightly as you wind it, but do not stretch it too much. Wind the bobbin until the elastic thread is even with the edge of the bobbin, but not sticking out past the edge. If there is too much thread on the bobbin, then it may be hard for your machine to use it. After you finish winding the bobbin, place the bobbin into your machine as you normally do with regular thread.
