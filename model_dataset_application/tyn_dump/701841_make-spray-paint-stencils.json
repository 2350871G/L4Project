Cardboard or foam board are good for large, simple stencils on flat surfaces. Paper works for a single-use stencil on either flat or rounded surfaces. Poster board holds up better than paper and can be used on flat or slightly rounded surfaces. Plastic or clear acetate are good if creating reusable stencils for either flat or rounded surfaces. Frisket film, which is a clear film with a slightly sticky backing, is good for flat and rounded surfaces."

If you are using a photograph or an online image, you need to use a software program that can adjust the contrast and brightness of your image so that you have defined dark and light areas. It will probably be easiest to switch the image into purely black and white. Make sure that your current design will work as a stencil. If you are attempting to create a complex image with textures or shadows, make sure that you design does not force you to cut whole sections out of the stencil. Alter the image so that the stencil will remain as a single piece. Photo images also work best if you erase the backgrounds first. This may be the most time-consuming portion of the process."
