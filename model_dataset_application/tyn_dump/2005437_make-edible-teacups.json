Although you can use fondant instead of gum paste, the gum paste is stabilized with egg whites, shortening, and powdered sugar which will make it easier to roll thin. Gum paste will also show detail better than fondant. If you don't have a fondant rolling pin, use a standard rolling pin and dust it with powdered sugar to prevent the gum paste from sticking to it."

Crafting a Teacup and Saucer with Gum Paste Roll the gum paste into an \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) circle.

Then let the chocolate harden. Since you won't be gluing anything to the saucer, simply remove it from the actual saucer once the gum paste hardens. Creating Chocolate Teacups Put 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of chocolate into each cavity of a dome mold. Set a silicone dome mold on your work surface and scoop 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of tempered chocolate into each cavity.Variation: To make dark teacups, use milk or semisweet chocolate. For larger teacups, use a mold with 6 semi-sphere cavities. For standard-sized teacups, choose a mold with 12 to 15 dome cavities. Spread the chocolate in the cavities and chill the mold for 15 minutes. Take a silicone brush or use the back of a spoon to spread the chocolate throughout the mold so each cavity is covered. Then put the mold in the refrigerator until the chocolate hardens. If you used a mold with smaller domes, the chocolate will harden faster. Peel the chocolate cups out of the mold. Remove the mold from the refrigerator and turn it upside-down on your work surface. Gently hold the mold in place with 1 hand and use your other hand to slowly peel the mold away. The chocolate cups should separate from the mold. Set the cups aside while you make the chocolate saucers and handles. Spoon 4 circles of chocolate onto parchment paper and pipe 4 handles. To make the saucers, lay a sheet of parchment paper onto a baking sheet and spread some of the remaining tempered chocolate into 4 even circles on the paper. Each circle should be about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) in diameter. Then pipe or spoon more chocolate onto the parchment paper to make 4 handle shapes.

Put the baking sheet into the refrigerator and leave the saucers and handles to set. Remove the baking sheet once the chocolate is completely hard. Carefully peel the chocolates off of the sheet so you can assemble the teacups. Attach the handles to the cups and set them on the saucers. To assemble the teacups, dip the ends of the handles into a little of the tempered chocolate. Hold the handles against the sides of the chocolate cups until they stay attached.
