The temperature of the pan should be somewhere between 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C) and 500 \u00b0F (260 \u00b0C). You can also use heavy wire mesh instead of a pan or griddle, although this is not the most commonly used method of roasting hatch chiles.

When the chiles become black or dark brown and begin to blister, they\u2019re done. Hold the chiles to the heat with a wooden spoon if they begin to curl up.

Discard the skin and the stem and use your chiles or place them in an airtight container and freeze them immediately. The chiles can be stored in the freezer for up to 12 months. The skin should come off easily and without too much force. If you find the skin is hard to remove, allow the chile to continue steaming in the bag for a little longer or use a knife to cut away the skin. If you\u2019re peeling several peppers in a row, consider using plastic gloves to protect your fingers."
