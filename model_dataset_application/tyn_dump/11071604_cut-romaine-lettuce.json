  "text":" Coring and Quartering the Heads Chop the head of romaine in half, lengthwise. Holding the lettuce steady in one hand and your knife in the other, chop lengthwise down the middle of the head of lettuce. You want two long halves of lettuce. For easy cutting, use a chef\u2019s knife and start by pressing the pointed end of the chef's knife through the open, leafy end of the head. Then, push down and pull back, making cuts until you slice through the core and have two roughly even halves. Cut the cores out of each half in the shapes of triangles. To remove the cores without wasting any of the lettuce, slice them out of each half using two angled cuts. Using the pointed end of a chef\u2019s knife, make two cuts, about 2 in (5.1 cm) deep at roughly 45 degree angles at the base of the half. Remove and discard the triangle-shaped core. Slice each half into quarters, lengthwise. Flip each half of the head over, so the cut side is down, and slice them lengthwise into four more sections. You should now have 8 sections of cored romaine lettuce, roughly the same width, ready for chopping into smaller pieces according to your needs. Chopping Romaine to Size Chop the lettuce crosswise into bite-sized pieces for salads. Hold one of the quartered halves of lettuce at either end with one hand, cut-side down, and cut crosswise from the leafy open end back to the base into roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) sections.
