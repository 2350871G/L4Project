Use chicken broth to make the soup more flavorful. If you don't have chicken broth, you can use water.

If the chicken left any fat in the broth, use a strainer spoon to scoop away the bits of floating fat. Retain the remainder of the broth. You'll use this leftover broth to cook the macaroni and vegetables. Doing so should result in more flavorful sopas. Cook the macaroni. Place the macaroni in the stockpot of boiling broth.
