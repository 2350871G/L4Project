  "text":" Rubber band loop necklace Decide how many rubber bands you'd like per loop. There should be a minimum of two rubber bands per loop for effect, and you'll probably want to stop after six maximum, or it'll be hard to work with. Choose the colors. You might like a single color (all red, all green, all blue, etc. ), or maybe you'd like to mix up colors. Decide on single, duo or multi-colors and the pattern before you start making the necklace.

Lay the rubber bands out in the pattern and numbers intended. This will give you a good idea of the final effect and helps you to check that you have enough rubber bands.

In the center of the pinched loop, tie the next loop. Do this by laying the open loop underneath the pinched loop, then bringing one side of the loop up and into the other side of the loop, capturing the pinched loop in the middle.

Continue until the necklace is formed. Finish by adding a jump ring; press in place with pliers. Done. You can also make a matching bracelet. Rubber band and paper clip necklace Choose the colors of both the rubber bands and the paper clips. You can make the colors match, use contrasting colors, or use a rainbow of colors. Choose small and strong colored rubber bands. If the rubber bands are too big, they will sag and look odd. Attach the first rubber band to the first paper clip. Slide the rubber band in the clip opening, then pull to one end. Attach the next rubber band to the other end of the first paper clip. You've now formed the first part. Attach the next paper clip, followed by a new rubber band. Continue in this way until the necklace reaches the desired length. Put over your head. Your rubber band and paper clip necklace is now ready for wearing out. Spiral floral rubber band necklace Use the large pinkish-colored rubber bands commonly found in offices for large piles of paper. The rubber bands must be wide and of good quality. Sit a rubber band flat. Run a length of glue along one side of the flattened band. Carefully roll the rubber band into a spiral. The glued part should be rolled into. Hold in place with your fingers. Or, place a clothes peg or similar over the roll to hold it in place until it dries firmly. Repeat for as many times as you would like to have the spirals on the necklace length.  Assemble the necklace. Glue each spiral together in a large circle or oval shape. When you reach the end, try it on for fit. If you're happy with the length, attach a hook and clasp to allow you to open and close the necklace. Dangly rubber band necklace Decide how long you would like the necklace to be. This will affect how many ring links you need, as well as the amount of rubber bands you'll need. Choose a selection of differently colored rubber bands. Variety of colors is a good look for this necklace, although if you'd prefer a one-hued or single-toned necklace, that's fine too. Choose good quality, medium sized rubber bands. You will need approximately four to five rubber bands per ring link.

The beads can be placed every few links, for best effect. Choose either all one color, or complementary colors. The beads should not be too small or too large. They shouldn't dominate the necklace, nor should they be hard to see. Begin forming links to make the necklace chain. Open the first ring link using the pliers. Slip on 4 to 5 rubber bands. Also slip on the next unopened ring. Using the pliers, close the ring. This forms the first chainlet. Open the new ring. Slip on four to five rubber bands and the next unopened ring. Close the ring.
