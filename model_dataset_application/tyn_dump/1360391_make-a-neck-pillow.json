Sewing a Simple Pillow Find a terrycloth hand towel. Trim off any tags or labels. If you can't find a hand towel, you can use a larger towel or even a pillow case or t-shirt--jut be sure to cut them apart first. It needs to be at least 20 by 12 inches (50.8 by 30.48 centimeters). Fold the towel in half lengthwise. Most towels are the same on both sides, but if you have a fancier towel, it may have a right and wrong side.

If you are using a sewing machine, backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Turn the pillow inside out. If you made your pillow using a larger piece of material, trim the seam allowances down to about \u215d inch (1.6 centimeters) first. Add some dried lavender to your rice, if desired. Measure out enough rice to fill your pillow two-thirds of the way. This will be about one bag's worth. Add \u00bc cup (10 grams) of dried lavender, then stir it in. You can also use another dried, fragrant herb, such as mint or rose. Fill the pillow two-thirds of the way with rice.

You can do this either on a sewing machine or with a needle and thread. Keep the stitches small and tight. If you are using a sewing machine, remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Use the neck pillow.
