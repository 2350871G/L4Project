Pour 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of flour per fillet in a large bowl. Place one fillet at a time in the flour, then flip it over and press the opposite side into the flour. Dip the fillet in a bowl of beaten egg. Beat 1 egg in a bowl until the yolk and white are scrambled together. Then dip the fish fillet in the beaten egg so that both side are covered. Transfer the fillet to a bowl of crumbs. Once the fillet has been dipped in egg, place it in a bowl of breadcrumbs and press both sides in the crumbs so the whole fillet is covered. You can use whatever breadcrumbs you like. You can also use cornmeal instead of breadcrumbs for a sweeter flavor. Repeat the coating process for each fillet. It\u2019s easiest to dip one fillet at a time in the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. As you finish coating each fillet, lay it flat on a plate or platter. Don't stack the fillets, since this can cause the breading to come off. Heat oil in a large fry pan or iron skillet. You should use about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) per fillet you\u2019re frying. Pour the oil in a large fry pan or iron skillet and heat it over medium high heat. You can use any oil with a high smoke point. This includes grapeseed, extra virgin olive, and sunflower oil.
