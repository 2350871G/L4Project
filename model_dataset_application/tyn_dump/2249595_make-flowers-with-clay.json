  "text":" Making Basic Daisies Hold and rub the clay in your hands to warm it up. Roll and knead the clay of your choice in your hands. You can use white clay for the entire flower or a different color for your petals and for the center of the flower. When the clay is ready, it\u2019ll be easy to squeeze and flatten it between your hands. Roll 1 clay ball for each petal of the daisy.

The ball should be around the same size as the balls you made for the petals. Arrange your petals on top of the ball, radiating outward in a circle.
