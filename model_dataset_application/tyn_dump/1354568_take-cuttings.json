Most of the time they'll let you if you take a small amount. If you have friends, family, or neighbors growing the types of plants you want to propagate, you can always ask them for cuttings, too. Be very careful when transporting your cuttings. Place them in a plastic bag with a few drops of water or wrap the ends in a damp paper towel.

By doing so, you can prevent them from wilting while you work. This is especially important for cuttings taken outside, because the sun can cause them to lose water quickly when removed from their plant. Caring for the Cuttings Fill a drainable container with potting soil. Potting mix, which is often a mixture of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite, will generally yield better results for potted plants because of its superior drainage. If your container doesn't have drainage holes, you can drill 3-4 of them into the bottom of the container. You can also find soil specifically for cuttings at most home improvement stores. Water the soil in the container before you plant the cuttings. This is to make sure the cuttings have water available immediately once they are in their container. Water until the soil is moist, but not soaked. Use a pencil or a chopstick to make holes in the soil. Creating a hole before you insert your cutting ensures your cutting won't be bent or snapped when it's inserted into the soil. You can also use a knitting needle or your own finger if you don't have a pencil or a chopstick. Insert cuttings into their individual holes.
