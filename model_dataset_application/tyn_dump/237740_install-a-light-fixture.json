Current requirements for 120 volt incandescent fixtures (this includes tungsten, quartz, halogen) is .83 amps per 100 watts.

The three points, source, switch and fixture need to be connected together all with simple two-wire Romex cable when there is one switch controlling the fixture. If you're wiring multiple switches to multiple fixtures, it's important to separate your wring systems to keep them straight. The fixtures need to be wired to each other with a two-wire cable, and the switches need to be wired to each other with a three-wire cable. The power source can be brought to either of the three-way switch boxes, or any fixture box with two-wire cable. The cable between the switch and fixture(s) is also 2 wire type, but must be run from either three way switch box to the fixture box that has the power source. Do not deviate from the requirement."

Be sure to match the switch box height to those in the rest of your home. If a fixture is to be installed in the ceiling, the box should be a 4\" octagon box. It is important to note that even if a small light fixture is planned to be installed here, consider installing a fan-rated box, as a paddle fan might be installed here in the future. If installing recessed light fixtures, no box is installed as a wiring compartment is provided on the fixture itself. The open to be cut in the ceiling is provided by the template included with the fixture by most manufacturers or by tracing around the rough-in housing opening.

    "Installing the Fixture Cut openings for the wiring.",
    "Cut openings into the ceiling, or wall surfaces for the boxes, for the switch(es), and for the fixture support by first tracing around the box on the wall or ceiling surface.",
    "Be sure to match the switch box height to those in the rest of your home.",
    "If a fixture is to be installed in the ceiling, the box should be a 4\" octagon box.",
    "It is important to note that even if a small light fixture is planned to be installed here, consider installing a fan-rated box, as a paddle fan might be installed here in the future.",
    "If installing recessed light fixtures, no box is installed as a wiring compartment is provided on the fixture itself.",
    "The open to be cut in the ceiling is provided by the template included with the fixture by most manufacturers or by tracing around the rough-in housing opening.",

    "He has over five years of handyman experience.",
    "He has a BS in Business Administration from the San Francisco State University and his Certificate in Industrial Electronics Technology from North Seattle College.",
    "Jeff Huynh\t\t\tGeneral Manager, Handyman Rescue Team\t\t\t\tDon't take chances when working with electricity.",
    "Jeff Huynh, the general manager of Handyman Rescue Team, says: \"The first thing to do when you're installing a light is to turn off the power.",
    "Turn the switch off, and also turn the power off at the breaker.",
    "If you're not sure which breaker turns off the power to that room, shut the whole panel off.\"",
    "Install the wiring.",
    "Install the Romex or other cable between the power source and boxes in the voids of the walls, ceilings, and floors with a snake or fish tape.",
    "After determining there is enough ampacity in the circuit to support the additional load, extend wiring of the same size from the power source to the switch and fixture locations.",
    "If running a new circuit directly from the electrical panel, the new wire should be sized according to the fuse or circuit breaker size.",
    "Make sure your wiring is up to code.",
    "National Electrical Code Requirements for wiring need to be followed closely when you're installing a new fixture.",
    "When you're selecting wire for the job, make sure it fits the following constraints:\nA wire smaller than #14 copper is not permitted for power wiring.",
    "Smaller wires (#28 through #16) are permitted for low voltage applications such as thermostats and zone valves in gas & oil fired heating systems, door bells and buttons, alarm systems, telephones, networking, etc.",
    "These wires never enter electrical panels.",
    "A 15 amp circuit breaker or fuse should have no less than a #14 gauge copper wire connected.",
    "A 15 amp circuit is designed to safely carry up to 12 amps continuously on a #14 copper wire.",
    "Intermittent loads of up to 15 amps can be carrier for up to several hours.",
    "If the load of any device or appliance is greater than 12 amps, a larger size wire and circuit breaker is required.",
    "A 20 amp circuit breaker or fuse should have no less than a #12 gauge copper wire connected.",
    "A 20 amp circuit is designed to safely carry up to 16 amps continuously on a #12 copper wire.",
    "Intermittent loads of up to 20 amps can be carrier for up to several hours.",
    "If the load of any device or appliance is greater than 16 amps, a larger wire and circuit breaker is required.",
    "Connect the devices as shown in the diagram that matches your application.",
    "If you'd prefer to follow detailed instructions to wire the fixture to just two 3-way switches, please see the 3-way switch wiki.",
