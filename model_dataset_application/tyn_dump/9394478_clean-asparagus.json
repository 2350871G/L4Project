You can also wash the stalks individually to remove the dirt."

Use the thumb and forefinger of your other hand to hold the tough end of the stalk. Gently bend the asparagus stalk down, so the tough end snaps off. Snap off the ends from all of the cleaned asparagus. If you're using thick asparagus, you may need to snap off a few inches (about 5 cm) from the bottom of the stalk. Thinner asparagus may only need to be trimmed by an inch (2.5 cm)."
