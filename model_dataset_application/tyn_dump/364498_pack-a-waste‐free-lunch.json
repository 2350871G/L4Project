When you\u2019re finished eating, make sure to bring your box back home to use the next day. Look for an insulated lunch box if you need to keep food hot or cold. If you don\u2019t have an insulated lunch box or access to a fridge, put a reusable ice pack in your lunch box to keep it cold. Steel lunch boxes are great alternatives if you want to avoid using plastic or other packing containers.
