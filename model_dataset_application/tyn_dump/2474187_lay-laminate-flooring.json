It will also prevent any creaking or squeaking noises when people walk on the floor. Cut the foam lining to fit the floor and tape it down. Do not allow the foam to overlap. Laying Down the Boards Place the first board. Place a board at the top left corner, finished side up, ridge side facing the wall. It is a good idea to lay the boards so that they are parallel to the longest wall in the room. Place spacers. Wedge a spacer between the end and edge of the board and the wall. You can buy spacers or make your own. If making your own, they should be 3/16\" to 1/4\" thick, L-shaped, and a foot long or so. You will need several, six or more for the first two rows. Repeat for the second board. Place the next board the same way, laying it end to end, occupying the next spot along the wall. For the best results, make the entire first row parallel to the longest wall in the room. Make sure to check from the edges of the floor boards to the edge of the wall to make sure that the row is even with the walls. Move on to the second row. Shorten the first piece of laminate flooring so the joints in this row will be offset (staggered) in relationship to the first row. Use a wooden block to tap the next row of boards into the first. Hold the block securely with your left hand and hit the block with a hammer in you right hand. The gap between the first and second boards should be closing. Keep hammering until the gap disappears. Continue until each row is done. Make sure that the gaps between the boards are properly closed. Check the boards every third or fourth row to make sure that they are staying parallel to the wall. Trim planks which don't fit into the remaining spaces. When you reach the opposite wall or have to do odd shaped rooms, you will probably have to trim boards. Measure how much you need and then cut the plank with a table saw. Use a sharp miter saw to cross cut the boards shorter and a table saw to make them narrower. It may be easier and provide better results if you cut the boards upside down. Don't forget your spacers! Don't forget to place spacers along all the edges of the room and remove them when the whole floor is done. Finish your floor.
