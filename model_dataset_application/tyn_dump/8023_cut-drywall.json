Use this process for making a sheet smaller to fit the last gap in the wall or in case your sheets are too tall for the room. Hold a tape measure over the gap in the wall to see how big of a piece you need and make note of this number. Bring the tape measure over to your drywall and mark where you need to make your cut in pencil. Most whole sheets of drywall are 4 ft (1.2 m) wide. Choose a length of 8 ft (2.4 m), 9 ft (2.7 m), 10 ft (3.0 m), or 12 ft (3.7 m), depending on the height of your room. Measure the last gap at the top, middle, and bottom in case your wall is uneven."

Obtain a drywall square or T-square, which looks like a large metal ruler with a T at the top, and place it against the drywall. Line up the right edge of your square with the pencil marks on your drywall. If you are left-handed, you may prefer to line up the left edge of the square with your marks."

Pierce the paper and about half of the gypsum core inside the drywall; this is called \u201cscoring\u201d the drywall. Run the knife downward slowly toward the bottom of the sheet of drywall so your blade doesn\u2019t slip. Take the knife out and place it at the bottom of the drywall to make the rest of your cut in an upward direction. If you are not tall enough to reach the top of the drywall sheet, you can lay it down on the floor to make your cuts instead. Use a new blade since a dull blade could tear the paper on your drywall."

Use a ruler and pencil to draw the sides of your hole by connecting your corner marks directly on the sheet of drywall. This will give you an accurate line to follow while you\u2019re cutting the hole. To cut a circular hole, measure from the edge of the drywall to the center of the circle that you need to cut.

If you have a difficult time inserting the saw into the drywall for the first part of the cut, make a small slit with a utility knife first and then insert the keyhole saw into that before you start sawing.

  "text":" Cutting a Large Sheet of Drywall Measure where you need to cut your drywall with a tape measure. You should use whole drywall sheets when possible when you\u2019re remodeling a room. Use this process for making a sheet smaller to fit the last gap in the wall or in case your sheets are too tall for the room. Hold a tape measure over the gap in the wall to see how big of a piece you need and make note of this number. Bring the tape measure over to your drywall and mark where you need to make your cut in pencil. Most whole sheets of drywall are 4 ft (1.2 m) wide. Choose a length of 8 ft (2.4 m), 9 ft (2.7 m), 10 ft (3.0 m), or 12 ft (3.7 m), depending on the height of your room. Measure the last gap at the top, middle, and bottom in case your wall is uneven. Hold a drywall square or T-square against the drywall where you need to cut it. Lean the sheet of drywall up against a wall at a slight angle of about 45 degrees so you will be cutting it vertically. Obtain a drywall square or T-square, which looks like a large metal ruler with a T at the top, and place it against the drywall. Line up the right edge of your square with the pencil marks on your drywall. If you are left-handed, you may prefer to line up the left edge of the square with your marks.

If you are not tall enough to reach the top of the drywall sheet, you can lay it down on the floor to make your cuts instead. Use a new blade since a dull blade could tear the paper on your drywall. Score both the front and back to cut a thin strip. If you are cutting a thin strip narrower than 3 in (7.6 cm) from the edge of your sheet of drywall, cut both the front and the back of the drywall with your utility knife before attempting to break the strip off. Flip the sheet of drywall over and make the same cut on the back. Trying to break a thin strip of drywall after only scoring the front will cause it to break off in many uneven chunks.
