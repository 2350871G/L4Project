For a fancier touch, you can also add in a wafer triangle or wafer straw. If you don't have any maraschino cherries on hand, you can use a small strawberry instead; it will give you a similar look! Serve the sundae immediately. Enjoy it before it melts! Making an Ice Cream Sundae Milkshake Add the ice cream, milk, and vanilla extract into the blender. To make this into a smoothie, use \u00bd cup (125 grams) of plain yogurt instead. Blend the milkshake until it is smooth. If the milkshake is too thick for you, add some more milk. If it is too thin, add some more ice cream. Be sure to blend the milkshake well after each addition. Pour a few tablespoons of chocolate sauce into the bottom of a tall glass.

It might be a good idea to serve it with a long spoon as well to scoop up any goodies that won't fit through the straw. Making Hot Fudge Sundae Cupcakes Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0). Line two cupcake pans with cupcake liners. Try to use pans that have 2\u00bd-inch (6.35 centimeters) wide wells. Prepare the cake batter according to the instructions on the package. You will most likely have to add some yet ingredients, such as milk or water, oil, and eggs. If you are using pre-made cupcakes, click here to learn how to assemble your sundae cupcakes. Fill the cupcake lines two-thirds of the way with the prepared batter. Make sure that each cupcake liner has the same amount of batter, then use the back of a spoon to smooth the batter flat.

Making a Knickerbocker Glory Sundae Prepare the raspberry pur\u00e9e. Put 9 ounces (250 grams) of fresh raspberries into a food processor and add 2 tablespoons of confectioners'/icing sugar. Blend until completely smooth. Save the rest of the raspberries for later. If you don't have a food processor, you can use a blender instead.

Scrape the pulp against the mesh with a metal spoon so that you don't waste any pur\u00e9e. Set the pur\u00e9e aside and discard the seeds caught in the sieve. Distribute the diced mango between six tall glasses. If you have not already, peel the mango, then cut it in half and remove the pit. Chop it up into small cubes, and distribute the cubes amongst six tall glasses. Use sundae glasses for that final, special touch. Layer half of the blueberries, ice cream, raspberry pur\u00e9e, and whole raspberries into each cup. Repeat these layers one more time until you have used up all of the ingredients. If you can't find any blueberries or raspberries, you can also use fresh, chopped strawberries instead. Top the knickerbocker glory with chopped pistachios. Another take on this traditional dish is to top it off with a swirl of whipped cream, sprinkles, and a triangle ice cream wafer. Making a Yogurt and Fruit Sundae Whisk together the yogurt, honey, and vanilla in a small bowl. Keep whisking until the yogurt is light and fluffy, and the honey and vanilla are mixed evenly throughout. Mix together your fruit in a separate bowl. Although the recipe calls for bananas and strawberries, you can use other types of fruit as well, including blackberries, raspberries, mango, and kiwi. Distribute one-fourth of the yogurt between two small bowls or tall glasses. Save the rest of the yogurt for the later layers. Layer one fourth of the syrup, granola, and fruit. Continue layering the yogurt, syrup, granola, and fruit until you have nothing left. Finish off with a thin layer of granola on top. Garnish the sundae with whipped cream and more syrup, if desired. For that final sundae touch, you could even add some chopped nuts or sprinkles. Top it off with a small strawberry on top. Serve the yogurt sundae. If you won't be eating it right away, you can cover it and refrigerate it for up to 3 hours.",
