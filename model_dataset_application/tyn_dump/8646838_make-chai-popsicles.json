    "Allow the tea to steep in the liquid for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently.",
    "The longer that you let the tea steep, the stronger the chai taste will be.",
    "If you are using tea bags, let them steep for about 10 minutes.",
    "Strain the mixture and stir in ginger.",
    "When the tea is finished steeping, pour the mixture through a sieve into a clean pot.",
    "Add a 1-inch (2.5-cm) piece of ginger that\u2019s been sliced to the mixture and mix well to combine.",
    "Crush all of the spices.",
    "Place 1 teaspoon (3 g) of green cardamom pods, \u00bd teaspoon (3 g) of whole cloves, a 3-inch (7.5-cm) piece of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of whole fennel seeds, \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of whole black pepper, and 1 star anise in the bowl of a mortar and pestle.",
    "Gently crush the spices with the pestle until they have a coarse texture.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a mortar and pestle, roll a rolling pin over the spices to coarsely crush them.",
    "Mix the spices into the cream mixture and bring back to a simmer.",
    "After you\u2019ve crushed the spices, add them to strained cream mixture.",
    "Return the mixture to stove, and heat over medium until it returns to a simmer, which should take about 5 minutes.",
    "Remove the mixture from the heat and let it sit for a half hour.",
    "Once the mixture comes a simmer, take the pot off the heat.",
    "Allow the mixture to sit for about 30 minutes, so the spices have time to fully infuse the liquid.",
    "If you want the popsicles to have a stronger spice flavor, you can let the mixture sit for up to 45 minutes.",
    "Stir in the remaining cream.",
    "After the spices have had time to infuse the mixture, add the remaining \u00bd cup (118 ml) of heavy cream to the pot.",
    "Mix well so the cream is fully incorporated.",
    "Taste the chai mixture after you add the cream.",
    "If you prefer your chair to be sweeter, you can mix in some more sugar.",
    "Strain the mixture into a bowl and chill it.",
    "When the cream is fully mixed into the chai, use a sieve to strain it into a bowl.",
    "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for approximately 1 hour.",
    "Pour the mixture into a popsicle mold and freeze until they are set.",
    "Once the mixture has chilled for an hour, transfer it to a popsicle mold.",
    "Add sticks if necessary, and chill in the freezer until they are completely set, which should take about 3 to 4 hours.",
    "Be careful not to overfill the molds as you pour the chai mixture into them.",
    "Whipping Up Chai Latte Gelato Popsicles Heat the heavy cream and creamer.",
    "Add 2 cups (473 ml) of heavy cream and 1 cup (237 ml) of chai tea latte flavored creamer to medium saucepan.",
    "Heat the mixture on medium heat until it begins to simmer.",
    "You\u2019ll know that the mixture is simmering when small bubbles begin to appear near the edges of the pan.",
    "Whisk the egg yolks and sugar.",
    "Add 5 egg yolks and \u00be cup (150 g) of sugar to a medium bowl.",
    "Use a whisk to blend the two together until the mixture is thick and pale yellow.",
    "To separate the egg yolks, crack the eggs against a flat surface, such as a countertop.",
    "Break them into two halves over a bowl, allowing the yolk to fall into the lower half.",
    "Move the yolks back and forth so the white drips into the bowl below, continuing the process until you\u2019ve removed all of the egg whites.",
    "Pour some of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture.",
    "After you\u2019ve combined the egg yolks and sugar, slowly add a small amount of the hot cream mixture into the bowl.",
    "Be sure to whisk the mixture the entire time that you\u2019re adding the cream.",
    "Adding a small amount of the heated cream to the eggs helps temper them, or raise their temperature, so they don\u2019t cook when you add them to the full cream mixture.",
    "Add all of the egg mixture into the remaining cream mixture.",
    "Once the egg mixture is tempered, pour it into the rest of the cream mixture.",
    "Whisk the mixture constantly to help prevent the eggs from scrambling.",
    "Lower the heat and cook the mixture until it is thick.",
    "When the entire egg mixture is added to the cream, turn down the heat to medium-low.",
    "Allow the mixture to cook until it thickens, which should take 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "You\u2019ll know that the mixture is thick enough when it coats the back of a spoon that you lift out of it.",
    "Remove the mixture from the heat and strain.",
    "When the mixture has thickened up, take the pot off the heat.",
    "Pour the mixture through a sieve into a bowl to strain any solids from it.",
    "Mix in the orange zest.",
    "After you\u2019ve strained the custard, add the zest from 1 orange to the mixture.",
    "Stir well to ensure that it is fully incorporated.",
    "Adding the orange zest is an optional step.",
    "You can let the chai flavor stand on its own if you prefer.",
    "Pour the mixture into a popsicle mold and freeze for an hour.",
    "After you\u2019ve mixed in the orange zest, transfer the custard to a popsicle mold.",
    "Place the mold in the freezer, and allow the popsicles to set up for an hour.",
    "If your popsicle molds have built-in sticks, you can just freeze the pops for 4 to 5 hours until they are fully frozen and skip the next step.",
    "Insert wooden sticks in the center of each popsicle and return to the freezer.",
    "If your mold doesn\u2019t have built-in sticks, take the pops out of the freezer after an hour.",
    "Place wooden sticks in the center of each pop and return the mold to the freezer until the popsicles are fully set, which should take another 3 to 4 hours.",
    "Unmold the popsicles and serve.",
    "When the pops are set, run the outside of the mold under warm water to help loosen them.",
    "Gently take them out by the stick and serve them.",
    "Leave any popsicles that you don\u2019t eat in the mold in the freezer until you are ready to serve them."
