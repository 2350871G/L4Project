Use the British Thermal Unit (BTU) measurement on the side of the propane heater to determine which size is best for you. BTUs measure energy. A single BTU is the same as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 millilitre (0.034  fl oz) of water 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C). Small propane heaters can create up to 5000 BTUs in the space of an hour. These heaters are perfect for camping and other outdoor activities. Large propane heaters emit between 10,000 and 45,000 BTUs in 1 hour. Larger heaters are better for heating large warehouses or building sites."
