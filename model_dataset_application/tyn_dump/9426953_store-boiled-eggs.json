The repeated opening and closing of the door can cause temperature changes, causing the eggs to rot more quickly. Keep hard-boiled eggs away from foods with strong odors.

Boiled eggs go bad much quicker than raw eggs; the most obvious sign that a hard-boiled egg has gone bad is a sulfurous, rotten odor. If it is still in its shell, you may have to crack it open in order to detect any bad smell. A gray or green yolk does not necessarily indicate that the egg has rotted. The color of the yolk is usually the result of how long the egg was boiled. If eggs are boiled too long, the yolk may turn green or gray."
