This will help reduce the amount of work your machine has to do, which reduces the amount of washing stress on your delicates. Grass, dirt, oil-based, and most beverage stains can be pre-treated with dish soap, if you don't have stain spray. For stains on whites, you can use a bleach pen. For blood or body-fluid stains, use cold tap water and light scrubbing as a pre-treatment, followed by a common hand sanitizer to disinfect the garment."

By putting only a few delicates (sorted by type and color) into each mesh bag, you decrease their chances of getting stretched, snagged, or losing their shape. It\u2019s fine to put mesh bags with different types of delicates into the same washing load (the bags will keep them safe from each other), but make sure not to mix colors. For a standard-sized washer, you can wash two to three mesh bags (filled with a few delicates each) at once. If the load is unbalanced, add a few lightly soiled permanent press items, like T-shirts."
