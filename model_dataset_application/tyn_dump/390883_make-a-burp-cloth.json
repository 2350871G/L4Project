Making a Striped Burp Cloth Get a pre-folded cloth diaper and some patterned, cotton fabric. Your patterned fabric can be anything you want it to be.

    "Turn the burp cloth so that the diaper cloth side is facing you.",
    "Sew all the way around it, as close to the edges as you can.",
    "Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to prevent the thread from unraveling.",
    "If you used any sewing pins, be sure to pull them out as you go.",
    "Use a thread color that matches your diaper cloth, typically white.",
    "Use a bobbin color that matches your patterned fabric.",
    "You can either match it to the background or to the pattern.",
    "Topstitch two straight lines down the burp cloth, \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) to either side of the of the diaper stitch lines.",
    "Most pre-folded cloth diapers will have a set of two lines running down the middle.",
    "Topstitch straight down the diaper, \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) to left of the left-hand-side stitch line.",
    "Next, topstitch \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) to the right of the right-hand-side stitch line.",
    "Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to keep the thread from coming undone.",
    "If you make your burp cloth using your own fabric, you can skip this step.",
    "You can also simply topstitch two vertical lines down the center of your burp cloth, about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) away from the long edges."
