Use your choice of oil, watercolor or acrylic paint. Using Aureolin, Rose Madder Genuine, and Cobalt Blue will yield a soft black while using Winsor Yellow, Permanent Alizarin Crimson, and Winsor Blue will yield a bold black.

If you use a paintbrush to dab paint onto the palette, be sure to use a different brush for each color so that you don't mix the paints except on the palette.

Spend at least 15 seconds moving the paints around to make sure you end up with one full color without any leftover bits of any individual color. If you use a paintbrush to mix the paint, swirl the brush gently and don't press down too hard. You can ruin brushes by pushing them too hard against the palette."

You might add a small dab of white paint to lighten the black, or you might add a drop more blue to create a black for a night sky. If you have time and paint to spare, experiment with the color. Add a little brown or green to the black to paint pine trees at night, or add some yellow for the sun reflecting off of black metal. Mixing paint by hand usually won't give you an exact black, but your black will have more character than a pure black."
