You can also use an accordion-style plunger to apply more pressure to the clog, which may help remove it easier. Many plungers come with a plastic base so you can keep it in your bathroom without contaminating your floor.

Continue pushing and pulling the handle rapidly so the clog loosens inside the pipes and forces itself out.
