Set the cup aside. You can find borax in the laundry aisle of most grocery stores. Don't get borax on your skin or you may have an allergic reaction. If you are messy, put on a pair of plastic or rubber gloves. If you want to make a multicolor ball, prepare a separate borax solution--one for each color that you will be using."

If the shade isn't dark enough add another drop of food coloring and see how you like it. You can use clear school glue as well. The ball will end up being a little translucent. If you want a multicolor ball, simply repeat the process with more glue and different colors. Instead of food coloring, you could try a few drops of paint instead. Try glow-in-the-dark paint to make a glow-in-the-dark ball."

If you can't find cornstarch, use cornflour instead. Don't use cornmeal, though. If you are making a multicolor ball, you'll need 1 tablespoon (9g) of cornstarch per color."

Roll the glue lump between your palms to make a ball. Try to make it as neat as possible. If you are making a multicolor ball, roll all of the colors together to make 1 big ball.

You can make it last longer by putting it into a zippered baggy or airtight container when you aren't playing with it. The ball should be ready to play with as soon as you are done rolling it. If it still feels too wet, let it dry for about 10 to 15 minutes. The ball will start to flatten when you don't play with it. If that happens, simply roll it back into shape."

    "As long as the bands look like the Rainbow Loom bands, you're good.",
    "Twist the bands, then loop them back over the scrunched up bracelet.",
    "Hold the bracelet between your fingers in 1 hand.",
    "Twist your other hand in order to twist the bands.",
    "Loop the bands back over onto the scrunched up bracelet, then let go.",
    "Continue to add bands until the ball is half the size you want it to be.",
    "Always work 2 bands at a time.",
    "Twist each set of bands as you wrap them around the ball.",
    "Alternate the directions you wrap the bands in so that the entire ball gets covered.",
    "Again, the color does not matter at this point.",
    "If your first set of bands was horizontal, make the next set vertical, and the next 2 sets diagonal.",
    "The finished ball will be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter.",
    "Your ball should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at this point.",
    "Wrap more bands around your ball, but use the colors you want.",
    "Again, take 2 bands, then wrap and twist them around your ball.",
    "This time, start using the colors you want your ball to be.",
    "When your ball is about two-thirds of its final size, stop.",
    "You can use all 1 color, or you can use multiple colors.",
    "Your ball should be about 1 \u20443 inches (4.2 cm) at this point.",
    "Add more bands without twisting until the ball reaches its final size.",
    "Continue to use bands in the color you want your ball to be.",
    "This time, just wrap them around the ball, but without twisting them.",
    "This will help make your ball bouncier.",
    "You should still be using 2 bands at the same time.",
    "Your ball will be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) at this point.",
    "Add 2 to 3 more sets of bands with a twist.",
    "Take 2 bands and stretch them around your ball.",
    "Give them a twist, and slip them back over the ball.",
    "Do this 1 or 2 more times, alternating directions.",
    "This will help hold everything together.",
    "You should still use the colors you want your ball to be for this step.",
    "Play with the ball!",
    "This type of ball is very bouncy.",
    "Keep in mind that the bands may come off if you play too rough with it.",
    "If that happens, simply put the band on.",
    "Twist the bands as you put them on."
