A quick wipe with a paper towel or cloth will take care of most small spills. Don't rub the spill into the fabric; dab it lightly so it won't soak in. Sprinkle baking soda over larger spills. When it dries, run a vacuum over it. Do a spot test before applying solution for stains. Choose a spot on the bottom or back of your furniture; you never know if a stain-removal method might damage or cause discoloration to your fabric. Use alcohol for stubborn stains. Soak a cloth or piece of cotton in rubbing alcohol and gently rub the stain until it is removed. Hand wipes containing alcohol are useful for this purpose. You can also use vodka if you don't have rubbing alcohol in the house. Just be sure not to use a liquid that isn't clear. Try vinegar on oil stains.
