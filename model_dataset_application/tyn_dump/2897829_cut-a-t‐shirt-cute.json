          "description":"Simply cut off the bottom of a t-shirt to make it shorter if it is too long, or make it into a crop top length. Cut evenly all the way around the bottom of the shirt to accomplish this. Each t-shirt will be different depending on the size and how it fits on your own body. Cut away a smaller amount than you think you want, then try it on. Make additional cuts if you want it shorter, and keep trying it on to check the length. You can also create a pattern at the hem of your t-shirt, whether or not you cut it shorter for a crop top. Try cutting strips for a fringe hemline, or cut shapes like diamonds just above the hemline for a cute cutout look."

          "description":"Convert a t-shirt to a tank top or muscle tee. Cut along the arm hole seams for a regular tank top, or further down the sides of the shirt for a wide-armed muscle tee look. You may also want to cut a wider neckline for a classic tank, but this is not necessary. For a muscle tee, you can cut in a straight or slightly angled line down from the shoulder to the side of the shirt. Try it on between cuts to make sure you like how much of the side is open. You can also cut all the way down through the bottom hemline of the shirt and tie the ends together at the bottom for a cute side-tie look."

          "headline":"Create a wider neckline.",
          "description":"Cut off the collar of any t-shirt to make it wider or just get rid of the typical crew neckband. Remember to cut less at first, then try it on to check the neckline before cutting any more. To make sure the front and back of your neckline are symmetrical, fold the shirt so that the shoulder seams line up and the neckband is folded evenly on itself. Then cut below the band, following the original curve of it. Create a v-neck neckline by folding the shirt in the same way with the shoulder seams lined up. Then use a diagonal cut for the front part of the shirt so that it ends in a point instead of a curve."

Or create the same effect by making the strips down the back of the shirt instead. Stretch out the slits after cutting to make the fabric relax and roll up slightly. Anywhere you create slits will provide some extra stretch in the fabric, which is a great way to make a too-small t-shirt fit a little better. You can also make slits vertically just to the inside of the front or back of your neckline to create more interest and stretch in those areas as well."

Lay the t-shirt flat and find where the shoulder seams meet with the arm hole seams. This is where you will make a cut on each side. Cut a piece out of one shoulder, then save the piece you cut away and lay it on the other shoulder to use as a guide. This will ensure both sides look even."

The slits should be about 2 inches (5 cm) long. Make the first slit where you want to start half as long as the rest, as it will begin to open up into a hole during this process. The slits should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from one another, but this measurement does not need to be exact.

Start where you made your smaller cut. Your first slit will be pulled open into more of a hole by the weaving process, so it\u2019s best to start with a smaller slit if possible.

Continue pulling the next piece through the current loop until you\u2019ve reached the end. Remember to twist each loop once before you pull the next piece through it to create more of a braided look if you choose to do so. When you reach the end and you have a final loop with nothing to pull through it, cut the loop in half. Tie the pieces securely to the end of your weaved fabric to secure it.

Cut slits and use the same method of pulling one piece under and over the previous piece to create the pattern. If you weave the sides, make sure you lay the t-shirt flat, with the fabric folded evenly along each side before cutting. If you weave the back, pick up the t-shirt and fold it in the opposite way, so that the arm holes line up and the side seams meet before you cut the back. You can create a more open back with several lines of weaving by cutting longer slits all the way across the back. Or, create two different \"strips\" of slits down the back."
