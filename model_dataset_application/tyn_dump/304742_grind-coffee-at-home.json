This is the most common type of grinder since it works well for drip coffee makers, French presses and cold brew makers alike. The beans are put into the top of the grinder, and when you put the lid on and press it down, it activates a blade that chops up the beans. A burr grinder is necessary to achieve medium fine, fine and very finely ground coffee. Blade grinders simply can't cut it that finely. If you're making Turkish coffee or Espresso, you need a burr grinder for it to come out right. Burr grinders are more expensive than blade grinders, but you can set them to any level of grind. Get this grinder if precision is important to you. Finally, you can use a hand grinder if you like to do things the old-fashioned way.
