Using an Air Pump Get an air pump with a narrow tip for best results. If you want to easily fill up your balloon, find a hand pump that has a narrow tip. The smaller the tip, the easier it is to get inside the filling tab. Ideally, you want a tip that is thin and about 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) long.
