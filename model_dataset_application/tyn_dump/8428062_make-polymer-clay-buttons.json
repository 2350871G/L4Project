How thick or thin you roll the clay out is up to you. If you can't find an acrylic tube, you can use another smooth, cylindrical object, such as a rolling pin or fat pen.

Press a stamp or texture mat on top of the clay to make an imprint, then peel it off. Background stamps with damask, scrolled, or floral designs work great for buttons. You can also use lace, doilies, or even draw your own design using a toothpick."

Inside, you will find two containers labeled \"Part A\" and \"Part B.\" Take out equal amounts of each part and knead them together to form a ball. The silicon will set quickly, so have your desired button or cabochon ready. You will need one to make an imprint. Press the button or cabochon into the silicon. Use your fingers to press the silicon around the sides of the button or cabochon for a tight fit. Be careful not to cover up the back. Work quickly as the silicon will start to set fast. Remove the button or cabochon from the mold once the silicon sets. In most cases, the silicon will harden and turn a darker color. It will still be somewhat flexible and rubbery. Once the silicon sets and you can't \"shape\" it anymore, pull the button out. You should now have a perfect cast. Press your clay into the mold. Knead some clay to soften it up first.

The color of the jump ring does not matter, but an unpainted one will probably hold up to baking the best. If you can't find a jump ring, you can glue a button shank to the back of the clay piece after you bake it. Smooth the slit under the jump ring shut.
