      "description":"Brown the carcass all over while breaking it up with a wooden spoon. The browner you cook it, the browner the stock. Alternatively roast the carcass or chicken pieces until richly golden brown and add to the stock pot. Note:  The leftover roast carcass removed of most meat is good to make a basic stock if you are economically minded and intend to make a chicken soup for the next day, as you can add the leftover roast meat to the soup at the last minute. This is not ideal for making basic stock as you would have to be very mindful of other flavours added to the chicken before roasting (such as sage and onion, garlic, lemon, spices etc) that will come through into the stock that may be undesirable in other dishes."

      "description":"Simmer very gently for 30 minutes to 1 hour, although if you desire a nice clear stock it is best to cook at a lower 80-85C / 175-185F. A pressure cooker is a very useful way to make stocks quickly when you don't need the stock to be clear. A slow cooker can also work quietly in the background while you do other jobs. Other additions may be 100ml of white wine, 3 small mushrooms (halved) or 1 tomato, in quarters."
