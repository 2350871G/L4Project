Do not overcook the ham, otherwise it will turn out too dry and tough. Trim the fat off of the ham before serving it. Slide the ham off of the pan and onto a cutting board. Use a fork to hold the ham steady as you trim the fat off with a knife. Serve the ham while it is still hot. Frying a Ham Steak Brown the ham steak in a large skillet.

Baking Ham Steaks Preheat your oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C). Make sure that the rack is placed in the center. Mix the sauce ingredients in a baking dish.

Mix together the glaze ingredients. Pour the brown sugar into a bowl. Add the honey, orange zest, orange juice, pumpkin pie spice, and nutmeg. Add some salt and pepper to taste, then stir everything together. Use fresh nutmeg. Scrape it against a rasp grater, or any fine grater. Set the ham on a large sheet of aluminum foil. Tear off a large enough sheet of aluminum foil to completely cover the ham. Place the foil on top of a flat surface, then set the ham on top. Make sure that the ham is face down on the cut side of the last slice. Tuck a sprig of thyme between every other slice. How many sprigs of thyme you use depends on how many slices are cut into your ham. Plan on using about 10 to 12 sprigs of thyme for a 6 to 7-pound (2.7 to 3.2-kilogram) bone-in half spiral ham. Remember, tuck the sprigs between every other slice, not every slice. Cover the ham with glaze, then wrap it up tightly. Make sure that you pour the glaze evenly over the slice and allow it to sink in between the slices. Set the rest of the glaze aside for later, then wrap the aluminum foil tightly around the ham. Place the ham on a wire rack in a roasting pan filled with water. Fill a roasting pan with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Set a wire rack into the pan, then place the foil-wrapped ham on top. Roast the ham in the oven until it reaches 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) inside. How long this takes depends on the size of the ham. Stick a meat thermometer into the ham after about 2 hours. If it reads 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C), the ham is ready. If it reads below 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C), the ham needs to be cooked longer. In general, it will take about 20 minutes per pound (454 grams) for the ham to cook. Heat the rest of the glaze. Pour the rest of the glaze into a small saucepan. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat, whisking often. As soon as the bubbles appear, take the glaze off of the stove and allow it to rest. The glaze will rest during the next step. Increase the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) while the glaze rests. As soon as you finish cooking the glaze, turn the oven up to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). During the time it takes for the oven to heat up, the glaze will rest and thicken. Pour the rest of the glaze over the ham. Carefully take the ham out of the oven. Use tongs to peel back the foil enough to expose the top of the ham; leave the bottom and sides covered. Pour the thickened glaze over the top of the ham. Roast the ham, uncovered, for 15 more minutes. Carefully place the ham back into the oven; do not wrap it back up in foil. Allow it to roast for 15 more minutes, then turn the oven off. Allow the ham to rest before cutting and serving it. Keep the ham in the oven with the heat turned off for about 20 to 30 minutes. Once the time is up, take the ham out of the oven.
