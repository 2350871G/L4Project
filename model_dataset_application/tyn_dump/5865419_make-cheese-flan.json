Before it melts, the sugar may begin to clump in the pan. Just keep stirring and moving it around and it will liquify. You can also prepare the caramel in a microwave. Mix the sugar and water in a microwave-safe cup, then microwave on high for five minutes. The sugar may caramelize before five minutes, so check on the mixture after four minutes.
