In this time, the bulb is gathering the energy it needs from the sun in order to bloom in the next spring season. Once all the leaves have died, you can dig the bulb from the ground or pot. Do not overwater the bulbs as the leaves die. An occasional rain is okay, but if the soil is too wet, the bulbs will start to rot. Loosen the soil around the bulb with a garden shovel and pull the bulb out of the ground."
