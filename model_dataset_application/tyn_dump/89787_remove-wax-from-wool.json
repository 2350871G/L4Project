Give the wax an hour or more to dry before attempting to remove any more of it. The wax will be easiest to remove if it is solid. Go back to the spill once the wax is completely hardened. Chill the wax stain. To harden the wax more quickly to make it easier to remove, place a bowl of ice cubes on top of it. Leave it there for several minutes until the wax is frozen. The size of the bowl and the amount of time you leave it on the stain will depend on the size of the wax spill. Use a blunt knife or spoon to chip away the wax.
