Afterward, open the hood to your car. Avoid parking on an incline just to be safe. Lightly touch the engine after letting it cool. If it's still warm, wait another 5 minutes or until it cools."

Locate the wrench socket size that is appropriate for the nut on the negative terminal. Attach this socket to your wrench and remove the nut by turning it counterclockwise. Afterward, disconnect the negative battery cable. Repeat the above procedure with the positive terminal. Typically, it is covered in a red cap or marked with a \"+\" sign."

There will also be a rubber vacuum hose running to it. If you're having trouble finding it, lift the engine's wiring harness slightly to give yourself a better view. Loosen the wiring harness by pulling out the plastic ends attached to its wires. Only remove the ones that make it easier for you to access the MAP sensor."
