  "text":" Using a Food Processor Shell some peanuts and put them in a freezer for several hours. Make sure they\u2019re cold so they have an easier time getting crushed in the food processor. Pour 1 cup (.2 liters) of the cold peanuts into a food processor. Crush one cup of peanuts at a time to avoid unevenly-sized pieces. Put the lid on the food processor and hold down the pulse button. Only hold down the pulse button for a few seconds; the goal is to crush the nuts in short bursts, not all at once. After a few seconds of pulsing, release the pulse button and let the peanuts rest for 2 - 3 seconds. Alternate between pulsing and resting until the peanuts are crushed. Pulse the peanuts for longer for more finely crushed pieces. Avoid over processing the peanuts or they will release their natural oils and become too oily. Empty the crushed peanuts into a dish and repeat with more peanuts. Continue crushing 1 cup (.2 liters) of peanuts at a time until you\u2019ve crushed your desired amount. Crushing Peanuts by Hand Fill a small plastic bag with 1 cup (.2 liters) of unshelled peanuts. Make sure the bag isn\u2019t overflowing with peanuts or they might fall out as you\u2019re crushing them. Twist or zip the bag closed. Place the bag on a cutting board and gently beat it with a rolling pin. Hold the rolling pin like a hammer and continue to beat the bag until the peanuts inside have flattened into one single layer.

Dump the peanuts out of the bag and onto the cutting board. Use your hand to spread the peanuts out in a single, concentrated layer at the center of the board. Use the rolling pin to press down on the peanuts and crush them. Carry the rolling pin across the layer of peanuts, stopping and pressing down on each row until you feel the peanuts crush underneath. Lift and press the rolling pin, don't roll it. Continue doing this until you\u2019re satisfied with how crushed the peanuts are.",
