          "description":"To determine the dimensions of your valance fabric, measure the area where you will hang the valance. Measure the window from side to side to get the width of the valance, and measure from the curtain rod to the part of the window where you want the valance to end to get the length of your valance. Record these measurements. You can make your valance as long or short as you want, but they typically only cover the top quarter or third of the window. Therefore, if your window is 45 inches (110 cm) long, then your valance might be 12 inches (30 cm) to 15 inches (38 cm) long."

Add 5 inches (13 cm) to the width measurement and 3 inches (7.6 cm) to the length measurement. For example, if the width measurement was 23 inches (58 cm), then add 5 inches (13 cm) for a new total of 28 inches (71 cm). If the length measurement was 30 inches (76 cm), then add 3 inches (7.6 cm) for a total of 33 inches (84 cm)."

Therefore, if your window is 45 inches (110 cm) long, then your valance might be 12 inches (30 cm) to 15 inches (38 cm) long. Add 5 inches (13 cm) to the width and 3 inches (7.6 cm) to the length. To ensure that you will have enough fabric to hem the edges, you will need to add onto the measurements you took. Add 5 inches (13 cm) to the width measurement and 3 inches (7.6 cm) to the length measurement. For example, if the width measurement was 23 inches (58 cm), then add 5 inches (13 cm) for a new total of 28 inches (71 cm). If the length measurement was 30 inches (76 cm), then add 3 inches (7.6 cm) for a total of 33 inches (84 cm). Multiple the width by 1.5 if you want a gathered valance (optional). For a gathered look, multiply the width of your window by 1.5 and use this as your width measurement for the valance fabric. For example, if the width of your window is 30 inches (76 cm), then you could multiply by 1.5 for a total of 45 inches (110 cm). However, having a gathered curtain is a style choice, not a necessity.

Then, measure and mark the inside of the fabric with fabric chalk or a pencil to indicate where you need to cut it. You can use a ruler or other straight edge to draw lines on the fabric. Cut along these lines. Folding the Edges Fold over the short edge of the fabric inward by 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Keeping the print side facing down, fold 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of the fabric inwards. Doing this will hide the raw (cut) edge of the fabric. Iron the edge using a low heat setting to flatten it. Use an iron to crease the edge of the fold. Iron all along the folded edge until the fabric stays in the folded position without holding it down.

Sew a straight stitch 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the inner edge on all 4 sides. Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch all along the edge of the inner fold on all 4 sides of the fabric. Sew about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the fold all the way around to secure the folds. However, make sure to keep the stitching on the inside of the fabric. Do not sew all the way to the outer edges. Remove the pins as you sew. Sew an extra stitch along the bottom of the top fold. To ensure that your curtains have a strong seam to hold them on the curtain rod, sew an extra straight stitch along the bottom edge of the top fold. Sew about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the bottom of the fold and sew all the way across the bottom of the fold so that the outer edges of the valance will be secured as well. Trim away any excess threads. To complete your valance, remove it from the sewing machine and trim away any excess threads. Hang the valance. Slide the valance onto your curtain rod by inserting the rod through the loop you created. Then, hang the curtain rod and fan out the valance. Make sure that the print side of the valance is facing you when you hang it.",
