You can buy either frozen lobster tails or claws. It's rare to find a frozen whole lobster that has not been pre-cooked. Warm-water lobsters, also known as spiny lobster, are not as tasty because the meat can become mushy. These originate from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Florida. The tails from the Caribbean have yellow spots and tails with yellow bands. The meat in cold water lobster, also known as Maine lobster, is more desirable. It\u2019s whiter, sweeter and more tender. However, it can also be more expensive. Cold-water lobsters come from South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and, Northeast America. If the store doesn\u2019t know whether the tails came from cold water, less expensive is usually indicative of the warm-water variety. Frozen lobster claws contain less meat than as tails and thus are less expensive. You can find them in the frozen food section of many grocery stores. Avoid buying any lobster tails with black spots or gray tails. The lobster probably died during the processing in those cases.
