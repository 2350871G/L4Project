    "Use a wooden spoon to stir, or simply shake the pan using the handle.",
    "This will prevent the nuts from burning.",
    "As they start to cook, you will see a small amount of moisture forming on top of the almonds.",
    "This is the oil being released from the nuts by heat, which will create a rich, nutty flavor.",
    "Although the stovetop method is quick and easy, the almond slices tend to roast a little unevenly.",
    "It's important to keep the almonds moving.",
    "If the pan you are using has a metal handle, make sure to use an oven mitt when shaking to avoid burning your hand.",
    "Turn off the heat when the almonds develop browned edges.",
    "The almonds should take between 3 and 5 minutes to toast on the stovetop.",
    "Remove the almonds from the heat when they begin to smell fragrant, but before they start to fully brown.",
    "Once the almonds brown, it\u2019s likely that they will burn.",
    "Pour the toasted almond slices into another dish to cool.",
    "Transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl or tray immediately, to keep them from cooking further in the heated pan.",
    "Allow them to cool for roughly 15 minutes.",
    "Use the almonds immediately or store them for up to 2 weeks.",
    "You can store the nuts on the counter or in the fridge for 1-2 weeks.",
    "Make sure they are stored in an airtight container.",
    "If you freeze the nuts, they will last anywhere from 1-3 months.",
    "Cooking Sliced Almonds in the Microwave Spread up to 1 cup (240 mL) of sliced almonds on a microwave-safe plate.",
    "Arrange them in a single layer with minimal overlap.",
    "Do not grease the plate.",
    "Place the plate into the microwave.",
    "Add a small amount of margarine, butter, or oil if desired.",
    "Use approximately  \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of butter or oil per 1/2 teaspoon fat per \u20442 cup (120 mL) of nuts.",
    "Stir the almonds together with the oil or butter so they are thinly coated.",
    "Make sure the butter has been softened before trying to stir it in with the almonds.",
    "Adding a small amount of fat to the nuts will encourage browning and make the toasting process happen more quickly.",
    "Microwave the almonds on high for 1 minute, then stir.",
    "Set the microwave to its highest power setting, and cook the sliced almonds for 1 minute.",
    "Take them out of the microwave and stir them with a spoon.",
    "Then, return the plate to the microwave.",
    "Stirring the almonds redistributes them and ensures they toast evenly.",
    "Repeat in 1-minute intervals until the nuts are golden-brown and fragrant.",
    "Aim to remove the almonds from the microwave just before they start to brown and become fragrant.",
    "This should take 3-5 minutes, depending on your microwave's power.",
    "All microwaves cook differently, so keep a close eye on your nuts as they cook.",
    "If you have an older model, it may take longer to toast the almonds.",
    "Make sure to stir the almonds at each 1-minute interval to make sure they toast evenly.",
    "Allow the nuts to cool, then use or store them for 1-2 weeks.",
    "As long as they are stored in an airtight container, the toasted almonds will be good for up to 2 weeks.",
    "They can be kept in the fridge or at room temperature.",
    "If you want the nuts to keep for longer, store them in the freezer.",
    "Frozen almond slices can last for up to 3 months."
