Then dampen a lint-free cloth and wipe the wood down to remove any dust that the vacuum missed. Repeat with a second wipe-down using a dry microfiber cloth. If your polyurethane is oil-based, use mineral spirits to dampen your lint-free cloth. For water-based polyurethane, dampen your cloth with water. Some people use tack cloths for the dry wipe-down, but be aware that some tack cloths may include chemicals that will interfere with the polyurethane\u2019s adhesion."
