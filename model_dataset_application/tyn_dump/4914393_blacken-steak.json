  "text":" Seasoning Steak Choose New York strip steaks or rib eye steaks. You want to use these lean cuts because they will cook evenly and blacken well. Choose steaks that are about \u00be-inch (2cm) thick. Defrost the steaks completely in the refrigerator overnight. Do not defrost them in the microwave, or you will ruin the process of blackening them. Mix up your Cajun rub. You can simply buy Cajun seasoning and coat each side of steak with \u00be tsp. (approximately 1.4g) of the seasoning, or you can make your own. To make the rub yourself, whisk together the ingredients listed above and apply them to your steak. Let the steak come to room temperature for about 20 minutes.  Preparing the Skillet Turn your gas grill on. Place one side on very high heat and the other side on low. Spray the low heat side with a little cooking spray before you start the grill. Place your cast iron skillet on the hot side of the grill. You want it to be as hot as you can get it. Allow it to heat for 20 minutes. Get some tongs, a plate and your steaks.  Blackening the Steak Place a one tablespoon (14g) pat of butter on one side of each steak.  Set the steak butter-side down into the hot skillet. You may want to cook your steaks one at a time if your cast iron skillet isn't very large. You don't want steaks to touch while they are blackening. Let the steak cook on this side for four minutes. The butter may catch on fire, and that is ok. Don't adjust the cooking temperature. Flip your steaks over. Cook them for three minutes on the second side. You don't need to apply more butter. Set the steak on the cooler side of the grill when you have blackened the surface. Keep them on this side until you have reached your desired doneness. Rare steaks can start to rest immediately after blackening. Cook for an additional one to five minutes, turning halfway through.  Place the steaks on a plate to rest. Cover the plate with tin foil. Turn off your grill. Serve after the steak has rested for 10 minutes. ",
