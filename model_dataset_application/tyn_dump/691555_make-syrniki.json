In Western grocery stores, the closest option is usually a firm \"curd cheese,\" \"farmer's cheese,\" or \"quark.\" In a pinch, you can use ricotta or dry cottage cheese. You can even make your own cottage cheese and press out the moisture to get tvorog. Tvorog tends to be a little tangier and less salty than Western curd cheese.
