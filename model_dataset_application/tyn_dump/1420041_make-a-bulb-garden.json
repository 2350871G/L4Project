Scoop a small sample of soil into the kit\u2019s vial, then add the included chemical to complete the test. If your soil needs to be adjusted, you can find amending substances at most gardening centers. To raise the pH, mix limestone into the soil. Lower a high pH by mixing sulfur or aluminum sulfate into the soil."

Any spots that have pools of water a few hours after the rain stops should be avoided. A few bulbs survive in damp soil, such as some species of daffodil, summer snowflake, and snake\u2019s head. You can amend poorly-draining soil by mixing sand about 8 in (20 cm) deep into it."

    "Sketch out where you want to plant each type of bulb.",
    "Draw a blueprint of your garden on paper.",
    "In your drawing, begin determining where you will place each bulb.",
    "This depends on what bulbs you choose and how much spacing each bulb needs.",
    "Also group bulbs to maximize your garden\u2019s colorful aesthetic.",
    "For example, plant all of your white lilies together, then plant white anemones on the other side of your garden for balance.",
    "Include red tulips and blue crocuses near your white flowers for color contrast.",
    "Plan on having larger, fuller plants, like shrubs or tulip bulbs, in the back of your garden.",
    "Note bloom times on your sketch to maximize blooms throughout the year in different spots in the garden.",
    "Choosing and Storing Bulbs Check which bulbs are suitable for your growing zone.",
    "Growing zones are geographical areas divided into climates.",
    "Growing zone charts are used to determine which plants are most likely to survive in your region.",
    "Search online to find your growing zone and which bulbs are suitable for it.",
    "Your government\u2019s agriculture department, as well as gardening websites, may compile this information.",
    "For example, snowdrops, tulips, and daffodils are fairly hardy.",
    "They grow in most areas, including zones 4 through 10 in the U.S.\nDahlias, tuberose, and sternbergia bulbs do better in warmer areas.",
    "They grow best in zones 2 through 7 in the U.S.",
    "Choose bulbs according to their space requirements.",
    "Read the catalog or bulb packages to figure out how much space you need to leave between each bulb.",
    "This differs from bulb to bulb, but larger bulbs need about 3 to 6 in (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of space.",
    "If you are short on space, choose smaller bulbs.",
    "Research the space requirements in advance so you can plan out your yard properly and buy enough bulbs.",
    "Many bulbs will need to be divided every few years.",
    "Dig up a clump and divide it into 2 or more sections to replant in another place.",
    "Buy and plant spring-flowering bulbs in the fall.",
    "These bulbs bloom in early spring, so they should be bought and planted around September in the Northern hemisphere.",
    "Place them in your garden at least 2 weeks before the ground freezes.",
    "This way, the bulbs have plenty of time to settle and grow healthy for spring.",
    "Spring-flowering bulbs include tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, crocuses, alliums, and some lilies.",
    "Get summer-flowering plants in spring.",
    "Summer-flowering bulbs need to be planted in early spring, around March in the Northern hemisphere.",
    "Place them when the ground softens so that they grow beautiful flowers at the beginning of summer.",
    "Summer-flowering plants include irises, dahlias, gladioli, begonias, cannas, and some lilies.",
    "Select fall-blooming bulbs for fall planting.",
    "Fall-blooming bulbs can be set in the ground along with spring-flowering bulbs.",
    "The best time for planting is in early fall, around September.",
    "These bulbs will sprout in a year, after other bulbs have faded.",
    "Some examples of fall-blooming bulbs include colchicum, autumn crocuses, and cyclamen.",
    "Choose perennials for yearly blooms and annuals as compliments.",
    "Bulbs are considered to be a special type of perennial, which means they can bloom year after year.",
    "Many other garden flowers are annuals or perennials, both of which can fill the spaces between bulbs in your garden.",
    "Annuals, such as petunias, marigolds, and daisies, bloom and die within a year.",
    "They have to be replanted.",
    "Biennials, such Sweet William and foxglove, flower and die in the second year.",
    "This can mean uncolored space in your garden in the first year.",
    "Perennials, such as peony, aster, and bulbs, flower every year.",
    "Think of them as permanent plants in your garden.",
    "Although bulbs are considered perennials in nature, you may need to plant more after 1 or 2 years.",
    "Select bulbs that feel firm to the touch.",
    "The best bulbs look plump and feel solid to the touch.",
    "Avoid any bulbs that look shriveled or have soft spots.",
    "These bulbs may be old or damaged and less likely to survive after planting.",
    "Order bulbs at a gardening center or online.",
    "Your local gardening center will have a selection of bulbs appropriate for your growing area.",
    "They may not have as wide a selection as online catalogs.",
    "Visit online gardening centers to select from a wider variety of bulbs.",
    "Bulbs purchased online aren\u2019t likely to be damaged during shipping.",
    "However, all bulbs should be planted as soon as possible to ensure their survival.",
    "Plan for shipping time, about a week, when ordering online.",
    "Make sure bulbs purchased online are appropriate for your climate zone.",
    "Store the bulbs in a cool, dark spot until you can plant them.",
    "Leave the bulbs in their original packaging.",
    "Choose a spot in a dry, protected area, such as a drawer, shed, or garage.",
    "Maintain the temperature at about 35 to 45 \u00b0F (2 to 7 \u00b0C) so the bulbs don\u2019t sprout or rot.",
    "Properly-stored bulbs may last as long as 12 months.",
    "A few bulbs may do better in different temperatures.",
    "Check the storage information online or on the packaging.",
    "For the best results, order your bulbs during the planting season, then plant them within a week.",
    "Be careful when ordering online.",
    "Online catalogs may have bulbs not suitable for your growing area.",
    "Planting Bulbs Dig the soil 8 in (20 cm) deep.",
    "Use a trowel or shovel to make a hole for each bulb.",
    "If you are planting lots of bulbs, digging long trenches makes planting much quicker.",
    "The largest bulbs, like tulips and daffodils, need holes about 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) deep.",
    "You may want to dig shallow holes for other bulbs.",
    "Read the instructions on the bulb packets to find out how deep each bulb needs to be planted.",
    "As a general rule of thumb, the hole needs to be 2 to 3 times deeper than the height of the bulb.",
    "Bulbs kept in pots are planted the same way.",
    "However, if you plan on putting the bulbs in the ground, take them out of the pots first.",
    "Spread a balanced fertilizer in the holes.",
    "Use a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizer, such as bags marked 5-10-5.",
    "Add a sprinkle of the fertilizer, about  1 in (2.5 cm) or less, to each hole.",
    "Mix the fertilizer into the soil at the bottom before planting the bulb.",
    "Fertilizers are listed according to the quantity of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.",
    "The middle number, 10 in 5-10-5, stands for the ratio of phosphorus.",
    "A liquid fertilizer with a similar NPK composition.",
    "Place the bulbs with the pointy side up.",
    "Bulbs are generally oval-shaped, like eggs.",
    "Rest the wider, flatter end against the soil.",
    "Leave the smaller end pointing straight up towards the soil\u2019s surface.",
    "If you are unsure which side is the top, lay the bulb on its side.",
    "The plant will grow upwards on its own.",
    "Position bulbs about 3 to 6 in (7.6 to 15.2 cm) apart.",
    "Walk along your planting area, spreading the bulbs.",
    "Make sure they have adequate growing space on all sides.",
    "You may want to save space and improve your garden\u2019s appearance by scattering the bulbs a little instead of planting them in a straight line.",
    "Daffodils and tulips need about 3 to 6 in (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of space.",
    "Smaller bulbs, such as crocuses, need 2 in (5.1 cm) of space or less.",
    "Check the back of the packaging to see how much space each bulb needs.",
    "Cover the bulbs with soil.",
    "Push soil back into the hole, filling it again.",
    "Press down on the soil with a shovel to collapse any air pockets.",
    "Then, rake the soil flat and check to make sure the bulb is completely covered.",
    "Be careful to avoid stepping on the soil, since this can crush the bulbs and compact the soil.",
    "You may wish to mark the planting spots with garden signs.",
    "Water the soil until it is moist.",
    "Water the soil immediately after planting the bulbs.",
    "Be generous, since you are unlikely to add too much water at first.",
    "Continue adding water until the soil stays moist.",
    "You can add about 1 in (2.5 cm) of water in the fall to keep the soil moist.",
    "However, stop adding water after frost occurs in your area.",
    "You can test the soil by picking some up and rubbing it between your fingers.",
    "Moist soil clumps into a ball instead of falling apart.",
    "Maintaining Your Bulbs Water the bulbs about once a week.",
    "Before giving the bulbs more water, check the soil.",
    "If it is moist, hold off on watering.",
    "Bulbs are prone to rotting in moist conditions, so avoid adding water unless it is necessary.",
    "If you get rain in your area during the week, you probably will not need to water the bulbs.",
    "Bulbs in pots need more care, so check them frequently to ensure the soil stays moist.",
    "Fertilize the bulbs once a year.",
    "Bulbs are low-maintenance, so you don\u2019t need to add fertilizer often.",
    "Try to apply the fertilizer at the same time every year.",
    "Purchase a balanced fertilizer or bone meal and spread it in a thin layer over the bulb garden.",
    "You can add the fertilizer when planting the bulbs, when they start growing in spring, or after they bloom in summer.",
    "Read the instructions on the fertilizer to ensure you use the appropriate amount.",
    "Avoid cutting the plant when it browns.",
    "After the bulbs bloom, the visible parts of the plant wither and die.",
    "While this isn\u2019t the prettiest sight, it\u2019s good for the plant.",
    "The plant reverts nutrients back to the bulb.",
    "Cutting off the leaves and other parts can make your bulb weaker next year.",
    "Once most of the plant has browned and collapsed, you can cut the parts off with a knife or garden pruners.",
    "Spread mulch over the bulb garden in the fall.",
    "Before the ground freezes, cover your gardening area with a mulch such as pine bark.",
    "Make a layer about 4 in (10 cm) deep.",
    "The mulch helps insulate your bulbs as well as protect them from weeds and pesky animals that may want to dig up your garden.",
    "Mulch does not have to be added in the warmer months.",
    "Since it retains moisture, mulching in warm weather may lead to rotten bulbs.",
    "Put up nets to block pests that damage bulbs.",
    "Digging animals, like squirrels, are the main threat to your bulbs.",
    "In the fall, install wire netting or make a cage out of cloth and chicken wire.",
    "Use it to cover your bulb garden so that animals stay away.",
    "Spraying the ground with a natural repellant, such as castor oil, can scare away moles, deer, snails, and other nuisances.",
    "During the growing months, monitor your plants for bite marks from deer and snails."
