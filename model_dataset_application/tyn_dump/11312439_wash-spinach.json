If you don\u2019t wash your hands before washing the lettuce, you might get them even more dirty than they were before. Dry your hands thoroughly, particularly if you plan to handle a knife or other cutting tool to remove blemishes."

You can use a knife to cut off damaged parts of leaves, or you can simply put the damaged leaves in a food waste bin. Any leaves that appear rotten or moldy should be immediately discarded."

The leaves will look a little different than you may be used to without the stem, but the stem tends to harbor lots of bacteria that washing cannot remove. You can discard the stem in a food waste bin afterwards."

In order to avoid this, use cool or cold tap water as you wash the spinach leaves, regardless of how you rinse them. For an added cleanse, you can use a mixture of 3 cups (710 mL) of water and 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar to wash spinach, though it will only remove slightly more bacteria than water alone. Stay away from produce washes and soap when washing spinach, which leave a slight residue that is difficult to rinse off and can be harmful to your health."

If you\u2019ve already washed the leaves in a bowl and you found dirt on them, you can pour the water through a colander and then rinse the leaves in it after the water has drained.
