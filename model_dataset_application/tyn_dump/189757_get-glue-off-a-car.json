Press the blade into the window about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the glue, then slide it into the glue repeatedly to peel it up. Be careful to maintain the 45-degree angle, because if you press the blade directly into the glass, you could still scratch it. Wipe away chunks of glue as you scrape them off.
