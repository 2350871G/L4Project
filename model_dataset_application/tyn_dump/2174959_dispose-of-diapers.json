Even if you have a locked closet or maintenance room where you can store your diaper disposal bin, make sure your container is reasonably kid-proof. Purchase a tall, bottom-weighted bin so that your child can\u2019t tip it over or reach into the bin. Some people prefer to buy diaper genies, which seal each diaper into individual bags.
