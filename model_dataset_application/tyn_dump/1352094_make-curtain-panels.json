    "Make sure that the lining is cut down to the size you want your curtain to be.",
    "Next, place it down on top of your curtain panel, right-side-up.",
    "Tuck the raw edges under the hems, and secure them with sewing pins.",
    "If you used sewing pens earlier, pull them out, and use them to hold the lining in place.",
    "Topstitch the hems down, about \u215b inch (0.32 centimeter) from the inside folded edges.",
    "Sew straight across the top hem first.",
    "Next, sew the side hems from top to bottom.",
    "Use a thread color that matches your fabric, and pull the pins out as you go.",
    "Be sure to backstitch a few times at the start and end of you sewing to keep the thread from coming undone.",
    "If you'd like a casing for your curtain rod, start sewing the side hems just below the top hem.",
    "If you plan on using clip-on curtain rings, you can sew the side hems straight down, from top edge to bottom edge.",
    "Fold the bottom hem of the curtain twice.",
    "Fold the bottom edge up by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) and press it flat.",
    "Fold it up by 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) and press it flat again.",
    "Topstitch or hemstitch the bottom hem.",
    "You can use your sewing machine to topstitch the hem down, \u215b inch (0.32 centimeters) away from the inner, folded edge.",
    "You can also stitch it down by hand, using either a hemstitch or a blind hemstitch.",
    "It all depends on whether or not you want the stitching to be visible.",
    "Snip off any loose threads, then hang your curtains.",
    "If you left a casing at top, you can simply slide it onto a curtain rod.",
    "If you didn't, you will have to clip some curtain rings to the top hem, then slide them onto a curtain rod.",
    "Once you have your curtain secure, hang the rod up.",
    "Making Curtain Panels from Bed Sheets Choose either a full-size or twin-size bed sheet.",
    "One bed sheet will give you two curtain panels.",
    "Twin-size bed sheets are ideal, but if you want fuller curtains, go for full-size.",
    "Make sure that you get flat sheets and not fitted sheets.",
    "Twin-size bed sheets measure 66 by 96 inches (167.64 by 243.84 centimeters).",
    "Full-size bed sheets measure 81 by 96 inches (205.74 by 243.84 centimeters).",
    "Wash, dry, and iron the bed sheet.",
    "Washing and drying the bed sheet will remove any shrinking, while ironing it out will give you a smooth base to work on.",
    "Cut the bed sheet in half, lengthwise.",
    "The easiest way to do this would by to spread the bed sheet out on the floor, then fold it in half lengthwise.",
    "Place some heavy books on the loose corners to weigh them down and keep then in place.",
    "Next, cut the curtain along the fold, from top to bottom.",
    "Fold the raw edges over twice to make the hems.",
    "Take your first panel, and turn it so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you.",
    "Next, fold the long, raw edge over by \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) and press it flat with an iron.",
    "Fold the edge over again by another \u00bc inch and press it flat again.",
    "If you need to, use sewing pins to keep the fabric in place.",
    "Topstitch the hems down, as close to the inside folded edge as you can.",
    "Backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing to prevent the thread from unraveling.",
    "Be sure to use a thread color that matches your bed sheet, and the remove the sewing pins as you go.",
    "If you don't know how to sew, you can use iron-on hem tape.",
    "Tuck the hem tape, paper-side-up under the hem, and iron it down.",
    "Pull the paper backing off, then iron the hem down on top of it.",
    "Measure the curtain, and make a mark where you need to cut it.",
    "Hang your curtain first, then measure where you want it to end.",
    "Add 4 inches (10.16 centimeters), and make a mark and both sides.",
    "Take the curtain down, then cut straight across the bottom, using the marks you made as a guide.",
    "An easy way to do this would be to fold the bottom of the curtain up, using the marks you made as a guide; they should be resting right on the fold.",
    "Cut the curtain straight across, right along the fold.",
    "Make sure that you are cutting off the bottom of the bed sheet.",
    "The bottom hem is usually narrower than the top hem.",
    "Fold the bottom of the curtain twice to make the hem.",
    "Turn the curtain so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you, then fold the bottom edge up by 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) and press it flat with an iron.",
    "Fold the bottom edge by another 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) and press it with an iron once more.",
    "If you need to, use sewing pins to keep the hem in place.",
    "Topstitch the bottom hem down.",
    "Sew as close to the inside folded edge as you can, and remove the sewing pins as you go.",
    "Use a thread color that matches your fabric, and backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing.",
    "Snip off any loose threads, then hang your curtain.",
    "Purchase some curtain rings, and clip them to the top hem of your curtain; be sure to space them evenly.",
    "Slide the curtain rings onto your curtain rod, then hang it up on your wall."
