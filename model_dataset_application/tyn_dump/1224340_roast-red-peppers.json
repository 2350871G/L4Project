Eat the stem end of the pepper or put it in the refrigerator to use later. Use a paper towel or spoon to scoop out the seeds from the pepper. Leaving the seeds on won't harm you, but the peppers may not taste as good with the texture of the seeds getting in your way. Some people just roast 'em whole and then cut them up and remove the seeds. This will work too, but it will make the peppers a bit more difficult to work with. If you do this, you'll also have to manually turn those peppers every few minutes, so you'll be giving yourself a bit more work to do. It will also take more like 40 minutes to cook them whole instead of 20 to cook them when they are cut in half."
