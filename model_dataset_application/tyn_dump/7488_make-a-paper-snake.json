Here's a list of what you will need:\nPaper plate\nAcrylic or tempera paint\nPaintbrushes, spongers, etc\nPencil or pen\nScissors\nCrayons, markers, or googly eyes\nRed paper or ribbon\nWhite school glue or tacky glue\nString, thumbtack, hole punch (optional)\nRhinestones, glitter, etc (optional)"

          "headline":"Paint or decorate the paper plate.",
          "description":"You can paint the snake however you want. You can use a paintbrush, a sponge, or even your fingers. Snakes come in many different colors and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nPaint the plate a solid color and let the paint dry. Next, dip a sponge into a different color and tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel. Then, dab the sponge all over the plate. If you want to add another color, wait for the first one to dry. This will give you a scale-like effect. Wrap a sheet of bubble wrap (bubble-side-out) around a rolling pin and secure it with tape. Pour two colors of paint onto a palette and gently roll the pin across. Next, roll the pin across the plate. You will get a scale effect. You can also color the other side of the plate to make the snake's belly. Most snakes have a plain, light colored belly. Do this once the top of the snake dries."

Here are some ideas to get you started:\nPaint thick stripes across the spiral to make a striped snake. Paint Xs or diamond shapes across the spiral to make a diamond pattern. Glue some colorful rhinestones using white school glue or tacky glue. Try not to add too many, or your snake will be too heavy. Make some squiggles and patterns on the snake using white glue. Then, shake some glitter onto the glue. Tap off the excess glitter and let the glue dry."
