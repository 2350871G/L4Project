          "description":"Some bath panels, typically wooden ones, come with a \"plinth,\" which is a plank that screws in along the bottom of the panel. It overlaps the main panel so you can move it up and down to adjust the height. Lay the plinth on the floor and then place the edge of the panel on top so they're overlapping. Move the panel up and down on the plinth until the height reaches the measurement you took for your opening. To measure the height, run the tape measure from the top of the panel to the bottom of the plinth. Screw the panel into the plinth by placing screws every 1 foot (0.30 m) or so on both the top and bottom of the plinth. For added water protection, apply a layer of silicone between the plinth and the panel. Unscrew the panel and run the tip of a silicone tube back and forth all along the inside. Make sure to add a small dollop to the screw holes, too, then put the whole thing back into place. You need to screw it together first because you need to add silicone to the screw holes you create when you put it together."

Mark a line along the panel on the back side and gently saw back and forth down the line to cut the piece off. Make sure to cut along the non-decorative edges. For instance, some panels have a decorative edge along the top, so you don't want to cut that off. You can also use a circular saw to cut it if you have one. Set the panel in place to see if it fits by placing it into the opening on the side of the bath. Tip it under the top edge and slide it into place at the bottom. If you see anything that needs to be adjusted, use the hacksaw to make changes. For instance, if the floor is uneven, cut off part of the bottom of the panel to ensure it fits."

Place a clip underneath the tub's upper edge with the opening of the clip facing out, putting the flat side of the clip up against the underside of the tub edge. Hold the clip in place, and then drill a screw into the clip's hole to attach it to the tub. Place at least one clip in the middle and one on each end. If you want, you can use a drill for this purpose. Drilling pilot holes (making a hole before you add the screw) may make it easier, but make sure you don't drill all the way through the top of the tub.

This type of wood just has a piece cut out of it on one side so that the lip of the panel will fit under it.

Otherwise, measure the width of the panel and the wood when they're placed up against each other away from the tub.

These holes should be the same size as your screws. Set the wood where it needs to go on top of these holes, then drill screws through the holes and into the floor to hold the footing in place. Use wood screws that are long enough to go through the rebated timber and into the floor; they'll need to be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). Opt for \u20448 in (3.2 mm) screws.

Use a 3 in (7.6 cm) wide piece of wood. Measure from underneath the edge of the tub to the floor and cut the wood to size with a hacksaw. Hold the piece in place, making sure it's flush with the other pieces of wood at the front. Drill 2 wooden screws in at a 45-degree angle toward the floor at the bottom, going through the side and footing into the floor. Drill 2 shorter screws into the wood underneath the lip of the tub, also going at a 45-degree angle. Check to make sure this piece feels solid before moving on. If you prefer, you can add some adhesive hook and loop strips to the timber. Put one adhesive side on the wood and attach the other side of the loop and hook strip to it. Peel off the backing so it attaches to the panel when you slide it into place. That will help the panel stay put."
