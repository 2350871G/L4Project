Cut accordingly. If doing more than one salmon, consider selecting fish of an equal/similar size for best results. Soaking the Fish in Brine Make up a solution of the salt and water as per the ratio outlined above.  Add the fish to the brine. Let soak for 1 hour. Remove the fish and drain. Rinse to remove accumulated salt. A stiff brush can help remove any lumps of salt that may have formed. Drying the Fish Dry the fish at the appropriate temperature. It should be cool and dry air at 50 to 56\u00baF/10 to 18.3\u00baC. If you cannot provide this, some other options are:\nDrying outdoors: Place in the shade or the sun will ruin the fish.

To be doubly sure of no mold growth, wrap in cheesecloth before wrapping in plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator. This must be consumed within 1 to 2 weeks of smoking. For long-term storage: Allow the fish to completely cool. Wrap tightly in suitable food-grade plastic and freeze. Cooking Smoky Salmon Rig up a wok as a fast smoker. To make this contraption, simply line the wok with foil. Put 4 ounces/110g of tea leaves, 8 ounces/250g rice and 2 teaspoons of sugar on the base of the wok.  Place a wok rack over the top of the ingredients. Lay the fresh salmon on top of it (fillets or whole fish). Put the lid on. Fold more foil right over the lid to seal it to the wok.
