These are more likely to go unnoticed.Warning: Generally speaking, it's not a good idea to disable a smoke detector for any reason.

Throw away your shower cap if it begins to look dirty or dingy. Overall, a shower cap makes a safer cover than tape, since there's a slim chance that you'll fail to notice it the next time you walk by."
