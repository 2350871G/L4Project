Put the red string, (the one at the side), over the red loop. Then thread it through the green loop. Do the same with the side green loop.  Pull it tight.  Put the green strings over, as shown in the picture.  Thread the red strings through the green loops.  Pull tight. Keep knotting to desired length. Making a Box Knot: Method 2 Place one strand horizontal and another vertical on top of it. Make sure they intersect at the middle of each strand. Put your finger on top of the intersection. Take the ends of the horizontal strand and cross them over your finger. Bring them to the opposite ends. Weave the vertical strands through the horizontal. Let the vertical ends cross over your finger and under the horizontal strand on the farther side. Pull all four ends to tighten into a knot.  Continuing With a Square Stitch Make two loops over the center with the horizontal strand. Bend the strand nearest opposite you to make one loop. Bend the other strand nearest to you to make another loop opposite you. Pass one vertical string over the horizontal loop nearest it. Then thread it through the second loop farthest it. Pass the second vertical string over the horizontal loop nearest it. Then thread it through the second loop farthest it. Pull all four strings together.
