You\u2019ll paint those separately.Tip: If you can\u2019t remove the hardware, cover it with painter\u2019s tape.

Brush the sandpaper firmly over the areas you\u2019re distressing to remove some or all of the paint in that spot. You can sand any section of the furniture as well, like the top or the fronts of the drawers. If you don't have sandpaper, you can use steel wool.
