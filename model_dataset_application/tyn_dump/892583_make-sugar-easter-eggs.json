    "Liquids resemble watercolors and pastes resemble oil/acrylic paints.",
    "Using a glue made of icing thinned with a little water or pasteurized egg white (it should reach a thin, paste-like consistency), decoupage a photo or paper on.",
    "Small paper cake decorations featuring chicks, bunnies, spring themes, etc., are all ideal.",
    "As this can add to the drying time it's better to make these eggs well in advance.",
    "Use ribbons or other decorative add-ons.",
    "Use the sugar eggs as a decoration and/or gifts.",
    "Your completed eggs can be used as a table centerpiece, as a gift, decoration or as a symbolic gift at baby showers.",
    "They can last for decades if stored well!",
    "Fondant Method 2 Gather the fondant and knead it until it becomes smooth.",
    "If you wish to flavor the fondant, you can knead in flavorings to taste (such as cocoa powder, instant coffee powder, custard powder, etc).",
    "Shape the balls of fondant into solid egg shapes about the size of a large grape and keep it covered with cling film.",
    "You can press the fondant into small egg molds (dusted with cornflour as per above fondant egg method) for a neat finish, but this does take much longer as you will need to have two sides of the mold to press the fondant into shape.",
    "Cover it with cling film and refrigerate until firm (approximately 1-2 hours).",
    "Using a small skewer, fork or toothpick, dip the eggs into the cooled melted chocolate and twirl or turn the egg very gently in the air above the bowl to coat.",
    "Allow the excess to drip off.",
    "Keep twirling the egg gently until it has just set.",
    "The cold fondant and the cooler melted chocolate means it will set faster, but if the chocolate is too cold, it will provide a really thick coating.",
    "It is recommended to have the chocolate warm enough to give a thin coating just to cover.",
    "When the chocolate has set, it will no longer be as glossy and a thin coating will not take long at all.",
    "Place onto a tray lined with baking parchment and store in a cool place.",
    "If you quickly dip and then place the egg directly on a tray, the chocolate will run and set flat on one side and will not look as neat.",
    "These can be decorated when chocolate is still soft by rolling them in crushed toasted nuts or dessicated coconut (or even dusted with cocoa powder or grated chocolate).",
    "Alternatively, when they are cold, you can also pipe decorations as per the previous method if desired, or cover with gold or silver leaf.",
    "If you wish to go further, you can double dip into a different colored chocolate by melting white chocolate with a little powdered food coloring.",

    "Carefully carve a small hole on the base of the egg using a sharp knife or a warmed skewer large enough to fit a piping nozzle into.",
    "Fill a piping bag or a large syringe with buttercream and fill the egg until full and then seal with a little melted chocolate to plug the hole.",
    "Skilled artisans can 3/4 fill the egg with white buttercream, then pipe the remainder with a yellow buttercream to make an egg white and yolk.",
    "The buttercream eggs can be messy things to eat, but chocolate and buttercream is usually win-win (except for for the diet...).",
    "For adult-only eggs, a little liqueur added to the cream is a popular touch.",
    "These are best made the same day that they are eaten.",
    "Sugar method Assemble the ingredients as outlined above in the \"sugar method\" ingredients section above.",
    "Mix the sugar and the water in a large bowl.",
    "The best method is to add all the sugar first and add the water gradually, stirring it in each time.",
    "Less is best because you only want the sugar to be wet enough to stick together, not too wet or it won't hold it's shape in the mold.",
    "Prepare the egg molds.",
    "Clean them and sprinkle a little cornflour to prevent sticking.",
    "Press the sugar mixture into the egg molds.",
    "Make sure the sugar mixture is pressed to an even thickness across the mold, about \u20444 to \u20442 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) (6.35mm to 12.7mm) thick.",
    "Don't make it any thicker or it will be too hard to eat and there won't be room inside it to make the egg hollow.",
    "Flatten the edge tops of the egg halves while they're sitting in the mold.",
    "This is to ensure that they will fit together with ease.",
    "Leave them to dry for 24 hours at least.",
    "As with the fondant eggs, when they're dry they should slip out of the mold easily.",
    "Join the eggs together and decorate them as outlined in one of the previous methods."
