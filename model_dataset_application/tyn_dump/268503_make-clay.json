Continue to add water and let the debris settle until your clay appears relatively free of debris. Dip your hand into the clay and slosh it around to check that it\u2019s clear. You\u2019ll likely need to rinse the clay at least 2-3 times to get it clean. Leave the bucket of clay-water to dry overnight. At this point, the clay should be very watery. Set the bucket uncovered in a place it won\u2019t be disturbed. Then, let it sit for at least 8 hours so that the water can evaporate away. Your clay will still be really runny after it sits out overnight. Pour off the excess water on top of the clay. Once your clay has been drying out for at least 8 hours, check for a thin layer of water at the top. Gently tip the bucket over to drain away the water. At this point, you should see a lumpy clay mixture. Your clay still needs to dry out a lot before you can use it. Put the lumpy clay mixture into a piece of fabric to dry for 2 days. Lay out a big piece of fabric, like an old t-shirt. Then, pour the clay mixture onto the fabric, being careful not to lose any. Quickly wrap the fabric around the clay to trap it inside. Hang the fabric up outside so that the water can drip out of the fabric. Some of the clay will be quite runny, so be careful as you pour. Leave your clay in the sun until it reaches your desired consistency. Open the fabric and lay the clay out on the ground. Use your hand to spread out the clay over the fabric so it suns evenly. Check the clay every 6-8 hours during daylight to see if it feels like it\u2019s ready for pottery. Expect it to take about a day to reach the right consistency. It\u2019s okay to start using your clay for pottery as soon as you\u2019re happy with the consistency.",
