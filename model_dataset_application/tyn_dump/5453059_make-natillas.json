Mix the contents of the saucepan slowly and continuously as they heat up and do not use a higher heat setting. Milk burns and sticks to pans easily, so continuous motion and low heat are both necessities. Continue heating and stirring until the mixture becomes hot but do not allow it to reach a boil yet.

When the egg whites are ready, stiff peaks should form when you lift the mixer out. These peaks should stand sharply without drooping. Note that the addition of egg whites is mostly found in Mexican versions of natillas. Many traditional Spanish versions do not use egg whites, and the result is a much denser custard.
