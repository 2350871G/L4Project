Iron your fabric to get rid of any wrinkles before you begin working with it. Depending on the type of fabric, you may need to pre-wash and dry it before ironing it. For example, if your fabric is one that will likely shrink the first time you wash it, such as cotton, then pre-washing is recommended."

If you do not have a cutting mat and rotary cutter and do not want to purchase these items, then you may also use scissors and a ruler to make your cuts.

You can also use what is known in quilting terms as a \u201cfat quarter\u201d to make your bias binding strips. This is a piece of fabric that measures 1.25 yards (1.14 m) by 1.25 yards (1.14 m)."
