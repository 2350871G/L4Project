Bamboo sticks are usually sold for use in cooking, such as making kebabs, or for crafts, and the best ones for making a Diwali paper lantern are cylindrical, not angled. If you can't get your hands on bamboo sticks, you may be able to find suitable alternatives, as long as they're thin but sturdy. You can make this with any length bamboo sticks, as long as the electric bulb and socket you plan to use will fit comfortably inside without touching the sides of the lantern. Trim off any jagged or pointy edges at the break."

For more manageable sizes, cut the paper into 5-inch, 7-inch and 9-inch squares and rectangles. For stronger tissue paper, layer two sheets of the same color and glue their edges together. Color blocking, stripes, or diamond shapes will bring out the natural design of the lantern. Use a very thin layer of glue to glue edges together. Use tape if you like. Colored tape or even glittery tape can both stick the paper together and make them look good. Kids might enjoy drawing stories or scenes of their home and family on their paper. Crafty types might be interested in developing their designs even more, by using a penknife to cut out designs and layering two or more colors together."

By the end of this step it should look like you have an upside down bamboo stick table with bamboo stick \"legs.\" Glue each of the four table \"legs\" to inner corners of second square. By the end of this step, you should have a rectangular box frame with four, one to two inch legs sticking out at each end. Let glue dry completely.

Affix a nail or hook and feed the electric cord with bulb through it, and note the distance between the bulb and nail/hook.

Trim edges of paper with sharp blade. Attach paper to lower triangles with a thin layer of glue. Tap down. Let glue dry completely. Trim edges of paper with sharp blade or scissor if you like. Wrap ribbon around the top legs of lantern. Wrapping the ribbon will give the lantern a finished look. Secure with a knot and trim ends. Feel free to decorate the lantern how you like using different style of ribbons or strips. Wrap ribbon around the bottom legs of the lantern. Wrapping the ribbon here also finishes the look and provides a horizontal support to attach a fringe of ribbons. Make fringe on all four sides. Attach ribbons to lower strands of ribbon wrap. If tying the ribbon, use a cow-hitch knot. Hanging and Lighting Your Diwali Lantern Use heavy duty thread to hang lantern from nail or hook. This is the same nail or hook you are using to hang the electric cord and light socket. Adjust length so that the light hangs in the center of the lantern. Light it up! Now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor, and think about the triumph of light over darkness symbolized by your lantern! Use color-changing lights if you have them. This can make your white paper lantern look splendid. Use ones that aren't very flashy but are elegant and classy.",
