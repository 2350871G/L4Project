Inside, you\u2019ll find the creamy white flesh that the custard apple is named for. To avoid mashing the soft flesh, make sure the knife you\u2019re using is nice and sharp. If the custard apple you\u2019re eating is ripe enough, you may be able to simply sink your fingers into the middle of the fruit and pull it apart by hand."

          "description":"Run the edge of the spoon around the underside of the skin to loosen the edible flesh. It should come out in large chunks, which you can then eat whole or reduce to a more manageable size before adding them to your favorite recipes. The flesh closest to the skin tends to be a little more bitter than the rest, so avoid scooping too deep if you\u2019d prefer to savor the sweetest part of the fruit. Unlike regular apples, custard apples should always be eaten without the skin."

          "description":"Around the core of the custard apple there will be a cluster of small, dark seeds, not unlike an ordinary apple. Use the tines of a fork to dig out these seeds, or pick them out with your fingers. Once you\u2019ve de-seeded your custard apple, it will be ready to eat! Take care to remove every last seed before you take a bite. They\u2019re hard and can be easy to miss, which means chomping down on one won\u2019t be a fun experience."

They\u2019ll offer the same mouthwatering sweetness, but with a uniquely tangy flavor and a smoother consistency. Custard apples will also work well when incorporated into simple preparations like applesauce and fruit-based relishes.

The delightfully tart notes of the fruit will stand out well without overpowering the other ingredients. Since custard apples are known for having a somewhat sharp aftertaste, they\u2019ll pair especially well with super-sweet fruits like bananas, peaches, mango, and strawberries. Blending custard apples into a smoothie is a good way to take advantage of high amounts of vitamin C, potassium, and fiber they contain if you\u2019re not big on the flavor of the fruit itself."

Much like regular apples, the sweetness of custard apples can provide a pleasant contrast to hearty, salty, spicy offerings. Experiment using custard apples in savory recipes that traditionally call for other varieties of apples, like pork chops with baked apples or apple-stuffed chicken sausages."

It should be firm, but have a little bit of give, similar to an avocado. When perfectly ripe, the skin of a custard apple is typically a light green or yellowish color.

The gases that escape naturally during the ripening process will be trapped in the bag, causing the custard apples to ripen faster. If you really want to speed things along, stick a banana inside the bag with your custard apples to increase the amount of ripening gases present. Try to avoid letting your custard apples get overripe, as this can spoil both their flavor and texture."

When properly stored, it should stay good for at least a couple days. However, it will be best when enjoyed right away, if possible. Keeping custard apples in a lidded container or plastic bag will help prevent them from turning brown as quickly. Throw out your custard apples when the skin begins to take on a black or slimy appearance."
