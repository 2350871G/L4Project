Choose blue fescue if you want to cover bare soil or add some modest decoration to your garden. Blue fescue has a unique silvery-blue tint that adds beautiful color to any garden. Blue fescue can survive through all seasons but may wither slightly in harsh winters or humid summers. Blue fescue will not grow to more than 1 foot (0.30 m) tall."

Plant zebra grass if you want a large, wide, and brightly-colored grass to decorate your garden during warm seasons. Zebra grass can grow up to 8 feet (2.4 m) tall and 6 feet (1.8 m) wide. The growing season for zebra grass lasts from August to February. Zebra grass will wither and grow new shoots in the early spring. Zebra grass is tolerant of a wide range of soils but prefers moist soil."
