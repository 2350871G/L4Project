Look for a balsamic vinegar of Modena which can have a great complex flavor (especially the more expensive it is). Balsamic vinegars of Modena reduce down well. Lighter balsamic vinegars are more tart while darker ones are usually sweeter. Avoid using a traditional balsamic vinegar (labeled \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale\" and stamped \"D.O.P\").

          "description":"You can make any increment of balsamic reduction you like. If you use a lot of balsamic reduction on a regular basis, consider starting out with a whole bottle of balsamic vinegar. A bottle is usually around 16 ounces (2 cups). Pour the balsamic vinegar into a small heavy saucepan. If you're only planning on using the balsamic reduction for one meal or dessert, consider starting with just 8 ounces (1 cup) of balsamic vinegar. Using a wide and shallow pan will help the balsamic vinegar cook down more evenly."

          "description":"If you're planning on drizzling your balsamic reduction over berries, a dessert, or ice cream, you may want to stir in 1/2 cup of granulated sugar to the pan with the balsamic vinegar. As the mixture reduces, the sugars will caramelize a little and give a slightly sweet taste to your reduction. Some people recommend adding sugar or other flavors (like cinnamon, orange, fig, or fresh herbs) to an already finished reduction. That way, you could use a straight balsamic reduction for more things."

          "headline":"Turn the burner on to medium heat.",
          "description":"The goal with reducing the vinegar is to slowly allow moisture to evaporate so that the liquid is reduced by half or two-thirds. This will make the balsamic reduction thick and syrupy. Cooking the vinegar over medium heat may prevent the reduction from burning. At this point, you may want to turn on your kitchen fan since the balsamic vinegar will begin to evaporate as it reduces."

If you're using a smaller deep saucepan, it may take longer for the vinegar to come to a boil. Stay close to your stovetop while the vinegar is heating. It will only take a few minutes to begin boiling. If you let the vinegar boil too long, it can burn."

If you notice it stop, turn up the heat till it begins bubbling a little. Simmering is just below the boiling point, so the vinegar should still be slightly bubbling."

If you're having trouble gauging how much has evaporated, look at the side of your saucepan. You should see a line at the point where the vinegar originally was. Use this to gauge how much moisture has evaporated. If you added sugar to your vinegar, you can stir the mixture occasionally to keep it from sticking to the pan. If you'd like a thinner sauce for drizzling, cook it closer to 10 minutes. If you want a thicker sauce, cook it for closer to 20 minutes."
