Origami Soccer Ball Variations\nFor a standard soccer ball, use black and white paper. To add a little extra flair, opt for bright colored paper or metallic foil paper instead of the traditional hues. For a mini soccer ball, pick smaller sized paper.

Putting the Ball Together Swipe glue on the loose corners of each white and black piece. This will hold the ball\u2019s shape when you put all of the pieces together.
