Press a long crease in the tube along its length, then press another crease in the tube approximately 40 degrees around from the first crease. Stick a ruler in the tube to further flatten the space between the shortest distance from one crease to the other."

          "headline":"Bait the tube.",
          "description":"Place a piece of cheese, candy, or bread in the far end of the tube. Ensure it is of sufficient mass to attract a mouse but not so heavy that it will significantly alter the weight of the tube. Do not choose foods which are sticky or gummy; they can be hard to get all the way down the tube. If you do want to use, say, peanut butter, you could apply them to the bait end of the tube before applying the cap."

          "description":"Place the tube in such a way so that about 40% of it, including the baited end, hangs over the edge of the landing. If necessary, affix the tube with a small piece of tape, but take care not to tape it so firmly that it would not give way and tip over the edge of the landing or countertop when the baited end was subjected to slight force. If you're in a single story home, obtain a cardboard box approximately one foot high and craft a cardboard ramp up to the top of the box. Place one end of the tube at the end of the box."

Place a small pillow, soft cloth, or pad on the bottom of the can to cushion the tube and mouse who will soon be trapped within. Do not use a trash can which is too wide. If you do, it's possible the tube will come to rest on an angle, rather than straight up and down. If that happens, the mouse will be able to climb out of the tube easily."

Remove the tube and, keeping it upright with the open end up, take it at least five to ten miles from your house, preferably in an area free of housing. Dump the mouse out of the tube gently in a field or meadow. This type of trap is extremely effective, and ideal for mice living on or with access to a second story. If you don't think it's appropriate to drop the tube into a garbage pail several feet below the upper-story landing, you could affix the whole tube with a piece of string to the landing itself. That way, instead of dropping down into the garbage pail when the mouse triggered the trap, the tube would drop away and dangle harmlessly off the ledge until you recovered it."

The skewers should pass through it in two parallel lines which run perpendicular to the normal orientation of the bottle if it were to stand on its base. Insert a third skewer, half as long as the first two, into the end of the bottle (the base the bottle would stand on in a standard vertical orientation).

Turn the bottle over so that the hinge is on the top. Unscrew the cap and place a string as long as the bottle approximately one inch down through the mouth.

When you pull up on the cap of the bottle while it's laying on its side with the hinge oriented above the skewers, the bands should pull back with slight resistance.

When the mouse enters the bottle to eat the cheese, pull back on the string looped around the skewer sticking out of the bottle's bottom. The bottle will snap closed on the mouse, trapping it within. If you have a skittish mouse, you may need to modify the closing mechanism so that rather than pulling the looped string up from the skewer in the bottle's end by hand, you pull from a distance away with another length of string. Doing so could increase the trap's effectiveness, but will require more patience on your part."

Open the trap in a meadow or forest, allowing the mouse to go free. Dispose of the sanitary gloves and bottle trap. This type of trap is perfect for a brave or arrogant mouse who thinks he has the run of the house. If mice have become accustomed to human activity and brazenly scurry about even in the presence of many people, you'll be able to snap this trap closed on them with little trouble."

Tissue paper might also work in place of construction paper. It is important to maintain the appearance that the papered-over coffee can is capable of supporting the mouse when it walks across it.

    "Dispose of the sanitary gloves and bottle trap.",
    "This type of trap is perfect for a brave or arrogant mouse who thinks he has the run of the house.",
    "If mice have become accustomed to human activity and brazenly scurry about even in the presence of many people, you'll be able to snap this trap closed on them with little trouble.",
    "Making a Coffee Can Mousetrap Obtain a large coffee can.",
    "The can should have a mouth approximately five to six inches across and a height of about seven to eight inches.",
    "The coffee can should have smooth sides which cannot be easily scaled by rodents.",
    "If using economy size coffee cans which are ten inches deep or more, place a small pad or bunched cloth at the bottom to prevent injury to the mouse you'll catch.",
    "You can use plastic or metal coffee cans.",
    "If using metal, though, ensure they aren't ribbed with concentric rings which the mouse might use like a ladder to escape.",
    "Wrap a piece of construction paper over the top of the can.",
    "Hold the paper in place using a rubber band wrapped around the rim of the can.",
    "Take an extendable blade and cut an \u201cX\u201d in the top of the construction paper, stopping about one inch from the edge of the can at each of the four lines.",
    "Tissue paper might also work in place of construction paper.",
    "It is important to maintain the appearance that the papered-over coffee can is capable of supporting the mouse when it walks across it.",
    "Instead of cutting a solid \u201cX\u201d, you could try poking small, closely-spaced holes in an \u201cX\u201d shape across the surface of the paper.",
    "Place the can on the floor in an area where the mouse resides.",
    "Lay a long ruler or paint stirring stick from the floor to the mouth of the coffee can.",
    "If necessary, affix the ruler or stick to the can with tape.",
    "Mice come in different sizes.",
    "If you find that your mice are unable to scamper up the thin ruler, consider placing two next to each other and taping them together to ensure easy access to the trap.",
    "Place a piece of food on the construction paper.",
    "Place the food -- cheese, a piece of candy, or bread -- along the edge of the coffee can directly opposite the point at which the ruler, paint stirring stick, or other ramp-like object you've affixed to the coffee can meets the can's mouth.",
    "Do not select a bait food which is too heavy or gives lie to the illusion that the papered-over surface of the coffee can is stable.",
    "Do not place the coffee can near a countertop or step stool from which the bait could be eaten from the far side of the ramp without passing over the construction paper.",
    "Wait for the mouse to fall in.",
    "The mouse will run up the ruler to reach the food on the opposite side of the coffee can, then fall into the can when the apparently solid surface gives way beneath it.",
    "You'll know the trap has been sprung if you see the bait you laid is no longer there, or if the construction paper has been partially torn.",
    "Check the can for the mouse.",
    "Remove the ruler or makeshift ramp from the can and take the can to a location about five to ten miles from human habitation.",
    "Place the can on the ground and turn it sideways, allowing the mouse to exit."
