Consider the number of animals you need to control and determine the spacing and number of wires you need to use to install electric fencing. If you've got a particular plot set aside for your electric enclosure, take careful measurements and decide on an appropriate height for your fence. Decide on the length of each run, as well as the height and the number of wires necessary to complete the job. Price the wires per foot at your retailer to get the best deal possible. Different chargers are optimized for different lengths of wire. Check with your supplier to make sure that the charger you intend to get will work with the planned length of wire for your enclosure."

          "headline":"Select a charger.",
          "description":"To keep the electric fence juiced, you need a charger that will keep electrical current powering the fence wires. Solar charges do not need an electric outlet but they require a certain amount of sunlight, which can be an effective and energy-efficient option in your area. Electric chargers must have access to an AC outlet. Don't buy chargers with foot or mile power ratings, instead select a charger that's rated by joules. A higher rating in terms of joules doesn't mean that the charge will be stronger if an animal gets jolted, it just means that the electrical current will be more consistent, making a high-joule charger the smartest purchase. If you've got a five acre fence, you'll need at least a joule at the minimum."

          "description":"You can install electric fencing with electric fence tape or a variety of straight wire of various thicknesses. Tape is the easiest to see, and less dangerous than straight wire. Making sure that the fencing is easy to see is one of the most important considerations. 1.5- or 2-inch poly tape, braid, rope are perfectly effective for most purposes. Coated wire is likewise easy to see and to install. Half inch tape is probably too small for a more substantial fence, especially for horses or keeping deer out."

Place 1 grounding rod near the charger and use a post-hole digger/slammer to set the grounding post. Leave at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) of the post above the ground. When installing electric fencing, it's a good idea to set another grounding post 10 feet (304.80 cm) to 20 feet (6.1 m) (609.60 cm) from the first post."

Corner posts should be larger in diameter than the posts along the sides, and should also be installed with at least 1/3rd of their length under the ground, and/or should be properly braced. Don't use too many posts. A common mistake is to install posts too frequently, thinking this will result in a stronger and more secure fence. However, if you do plan to install your posts 40 feet (12.2 m) or more apart, you should install stays along the wires to keep them evenly spaced and create greater stability."

The wires will need to be pulled taut at the anchor end. There are a variety of methods for doing this: you could install a self-locking ratchet-style wire tensioner, use a come-along cable puller, or install a turnbuckle cable tensioner. Tighten the wire as much as possible, but take care not to place so much tension on it that it breaks, as this can result in serious injury."
