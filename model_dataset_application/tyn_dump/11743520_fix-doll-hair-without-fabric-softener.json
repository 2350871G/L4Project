Work the shampoo up through the hair, but don't massage the scalp if you're fixing a large doll. If your doll's hair isn't very dirty or you just want to give it a light wash, spritz antibacterial spray into the hair instead of shampooing it. The shampoo removes dirt and oil that's accumulated in the doll's hair. It also makes your doll's hair smell great!"
