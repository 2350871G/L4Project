Gently scrub the leaves with your hands and rinse. Cut out the spine from each leaf. Lay each leaf out flat on the counter. Use a sharp knife to cut along the spine on each side, separating the leaf into two parts and completely removing the spine. Stack the leaves so the flat, cut sides all line up. Roll the stack of leaves lengthwise. You may need to form several stacks to get tight rolls. Cut the greens into ribbons. Slice each roll into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Separate the pieces with your fingers, letting them unravel into long strips. Saut\u00e9ed Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet.
