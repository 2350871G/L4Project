Pick a lens that has a focal length between 300-600mm so the sun appears the largest in your photograph. Check local camera shops to see if you can rent a lens instead of buying one. Make sure to use a lens made for your camera brand. Lenses for different brands may not fit onto every camera."

Cut the piece of solar filter slightly larger than the diameter of your lens. Use tape to secure the filter to the end of your camera lens. Solar filters can be purchased online. Don\u2019t use the solar filter if it has punctures or scratches since light might be able to get through and cause damage."

Avoid looking through the manual viewfinder so you don\u2019t damage your vision.Tip: Look at your camera\u2019s shadow to help determine if it\u2019s pointed near the right place.
