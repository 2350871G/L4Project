  "text":" Sanding and Cleaning the Surface Lay a tarp under the doors. While you can remove the doors to paint them, leaving them in the door frame makes the job easier. Protect your floors by spreading a plastic tarp out under the doors. You can purchase a tarp at a home improvement store or wherever else paint supplies are sold.

It's perfect for covering the door's corners and the ridges around the windows. Tackle these difficult spots first since the paint bunches there. Angled paint brushes can be purchased from a home improvement store. Coat a paint roller with paint. Mini foam paint rollers are the perfect size for French doors.
