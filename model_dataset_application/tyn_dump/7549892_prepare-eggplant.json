Keep the eggplant separate from other fruits and vegetables, like apples or bananas, because it's very sensitive to ethylene, which is the gas produce gives off as it ripens.

If a recipe doesn't require a specific cut, choose from round slices, cubes, or strips, for example. Make the pieces as equal in width as possible. For instance, you don\u2019t want one slice to be very thin while another is very thick. Choose one width and stick to it. If you're cutting rounds, which are the easiest to slice, keep them \u20442 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick so they cook evenly.Tip: If you're stuffing, roasting, or grilling the eggplant, for example, you can simply cut it in half lengthwise."
