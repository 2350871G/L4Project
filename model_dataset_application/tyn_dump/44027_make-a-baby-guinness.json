Then, stir in 4  fl oz (120 mL) of cold coffee and 4  fl oz (120 mL) of cold coffee liqueur. This will form the dark coffee base of the jello shot.

To make a flaming B-52 shot, use a high proof Triple-sec liquor, such as Cointreau.

  "text":" Pouring a Basic Baby Guinness Pick a shot glass. Most glasses hold 1.25 to 1.5  fl oz (37 to 44 mL) of fluid.
