James Sears\t\t\tCleaning Guru\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: If you've cleaned the refridgerator thoroughly and there's still a smell, generously apply white vinegar to any surfaces inside of the fridge. Towel dry the surfaces. Use a dry microfiber cloth, rag, or towel to wipe down all the interior surfaces of the refrigerator and freezer. This will help prevent water spots from forming, and speed up the air-drying process. Air out the fridge and freezer. When the fridge and freezer have been thoroughly cleaned and wiped with water, leave the doors open and let them air out.

Leave them out of the fridge while it airs out. Absorbing Excess Odors Assemble and plug in the refrigerator. When the refrigerator and freezer have had sufficient time to air out, return the drawers, shelves, and racks to their original positions. Plug the appliance back in and let it cool down. Most refrigerators will need about six hours before they're at the correct operating temperature, and up to 24 hours before they're ready for food.
