Give it about 5 minutes of consistent movement and kneading to determine if this is the case. In some instances, your clay will require more than your own natural oils and warmth. If this is the case, move on to the next step. If working the clay with your hands is enough to give it new vigor, make sure you store it in a sealed, air-tight bag to prevent drying out again in the future."
