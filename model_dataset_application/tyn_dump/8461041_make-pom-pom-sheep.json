For a large sheep, cut a piece that\u2019s 3-inches by 5-inches (8-cm by 13-cm). For small sheep, cut a piece that\u2019s 3-inches by 2-inches (8-cm by 5-cm). You can adjust the size of the cardboard to customize the size of sheep if you prefer. After you cut the cardboard, it\u2019s a good idea to wrap it in packing tape. That will allow the yarn to slide off it more easily when you\u2019re finished making the pom pom."

          "description":"For the pom pom, you need fluffy white, cream, brown, or black yarn. Instead of cutting the yarn to a certain length, remove an end from the ball or skein and begin wrapping it around the cardboard widthwise. For a large sheep, wrap the yarn around the cardboard 120 times. For a small sheep, wrap the yarn around the cardboard 75 to 80 times. Use one hand to hold the end of the yarn in place as you wrap it side by side in a single layer on the cardboard. Once you\u2019ve covered the cardboard, start creating a second layer over the first. Continue working until you\u2019ve wrapped the yarn around the suggested number of times. While white, cream, brown, or black yarn offers the most realistic sheep look, you can substitute your favorite color yarn, such as pink or blue."

Tie the yarn as tightly as you can to ensure that it stays together. If you don\u2019t have twine, you can substitute a piece of yarn.
