  "text":" Slicing and Stuffing the Turkey Cut the turkey meat away from the bone if it's not boneless. Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut as much of the breast meat away from the bone as possible. Try to keep the meat in one long piece, rather than cutting it into smaller pieces. You can save the bones from the breast to make a gravy or soup later. Slice boneless turkey breasts horizontally to make 2 long pieces. On the thicker side of the breast, cut the meat in a horizontal line until you're about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the other side of the meat. Leave the two halves connected to form one long pieces of meat. Be careful not to cut the breast in half. If you do, it may be more difficult to get your roll to stay together. Place the turkey on a cutting board and cover the meat with plastic wrap. Situate your turkey breast so that it is laying flat on the cutting board. Then, tear a piece of plastic wrap large enough to cover the meat, and put it over the top of the meat. This will protect the meat and keep it from breaking apart when you're flattening it. Use a mallet to flatten the turkey to 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. Pound the turkey breast flat with a mallet, focusing on thicker areas. When the meat is flat, it should be and even thickness. You can make the meat as thin as \u20442 inch (1.3 cm), but flattening it any more than that can cause the turkey to tear when you roll it. If you don't have a mallet, you can use a rolling pin to press and flatten the meat. Lay bacon strips vertically on a piece of wax paper with the turkey on top. Line up 10-12 strips of bacon so that they are in an \u201cup and down\u201d position. Organize them so they overlap slightly on each side, and lay the flattened turkey breast on top of the bacon.
