The easiest way to create a wide variety of crocheted flowers is to use different colors of yarn. Choose three or more colors to use for the flowers in your flower garland. For example, you could use three different shades of pink, or three totally different colors, such as red, yellow, and blue. Try a few advanced flowers. If you want to add some variety in the types of flowers in your garland, you can also try making some more advanced flowers. Some of the more advanced flowers you can try include:\nPansies\nRoses\nCone shaped flowers Add some leaves. Adding roses to your crocheted flower garland can also add some variety. Try using some green yarn to create small simple leaves to crochet next to and in between your flowers. Stringing the Flowers Together in a Garland Chain 24 or more. Make a chain that is 24 or more links long to accommodate all of your flowers. You can space out the flowers as much or as little as you like. Make sure that the chain will be long enough for the amount of flowers you have made. Count your flowers and decide how much space you want to go in between each of them to decide how long your chain should be.

This will allow you to place one flower every five stitches and still have five stitches on the end. Try using green yarn to give the chain a vine-like effect. Single crochet along the garland to connect your flowers. Begin to single crochet along your garland until you reach the first spot where you want to connect a flower. Then, insert the hook through the chain first and then through the part of the flower you want to connect to the garland, such as through the edge of one of the petals. Loop the yarn over, and then pull it through the flower and the chain to secure it. Continue to single crochet along the garland until you reach the next spot where you want to attach a flower. If desired, you may single crochet through two stitches in the petal to ensure that it is secure or that the flower will hang a certain way. Cut and tie off at the end of the row to secure the garland. When you have connected all of your flowers and reached the end of the garland, you can cut the yarn and secure it with a knot. Pull the last loop out and then cut it in the center. This will leave a tail that you can tie into the stitch to keep it secure.",
