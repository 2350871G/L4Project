Push the knife in slowly while applying downward pressure and wiggling the knife side to side to widen the cut. Continue working down the side of the pumpkin. Once you cross half of the pumpkin, repeat this process from the other side. After making a cut around the entire pumpkin, make one final cut through the whole pumpkin. Afterward, rip it open with your hands. Hold the pumpkin steady with your non-dominant hand. However, be very careful to never put it in front of the knife."

If you're drying your seeds to roast and want some additional flavor, don't worry too much about removing all of the flesh. But if you're going to plant your seeds, be sure to remove all of it.
