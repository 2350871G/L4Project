Continue grating the zucchini until it is completely used up, then move on to the next one. When you have a sizable pile of grated zucchini, place it in a paper towel and squeeze it over the sink to remove the excess juices. Measure the grated zucchini to make sure you have 2 1/2 cups, and grate more if necessary. Try to remove as much of the juice as you can, so the bread doesn't turn out too watery.
