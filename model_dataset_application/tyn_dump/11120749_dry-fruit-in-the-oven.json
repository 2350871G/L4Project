You can also dry sections of citrus fruits like oranges, pineapples, and limes, and experiment with other fruits that you enjoy. Look for ripe fruits with even coloring. Avoid fruit with dark, squishy spots. A green stem can indicate unripe fruit. If the fruit feels extremely hard, it's probably not ripe yet.Tip: Ripe fruit should feel firm to the touch, and if you press down with your finger, it will leave a slight indentation."

Then, depending on what kind of fruit you're working with, remove the outer skin, stem, seeds, rinds, and cores. You want to work with the fleshy, edible parts of each fruit. For example, if you're using peaches, slice them in half so you can remove the pits. Peel off banana skins, remove citrus rinds, core apples, and get rid of any stems. It's usually best to remove most tough outer skins. For example, remove the skin from plums, mangoes, and apricots. Leaving the skin on will lengthen the drying time."

Keep in mind that the thicker and bigger the fruit pieces, the longer they'll take to dry. The pieces will also shrink down considerably during the drying process. For example, cut bananas into round medallions or sticks. Section oranges and other citrus fruits. Cut apples into rings or chunks. Small fruit, like blueberries, cherries, and cranberries, can be left whole."
