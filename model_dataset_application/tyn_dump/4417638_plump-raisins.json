Regardless of how you accomplish it, you simply need to remove the plumped raisins from the liquid. You could drain the liquid by pouring the contents of the pan through a small colander. Alternatively, place the lid on the pan, leaving a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) gap between the pan and the lid on one side. Pour the liquid out through this gap, carefully preventing the raisins from slipping through. If you need the raisins to be somewhat dry after you plump them up, spread them out onto a couple layers of clean paper towels. The paper towels should absorb some of the excess liquid."
