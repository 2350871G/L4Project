Braising steak is a good choice for a higher quality cut, or stew meat is an option for a less expensive meal. Remember to use a designated knife and cutting board to slice meat.

The beef should marinate for at least two hours, or as long as overnight. Always marinate meat in the refrigerator, not on the counter which would encourage bacteria to multiply. Turn the beef occasionally to ensure that the marinade covers it evenly. Place marinating beef on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to prevent possible dripping onto other foods."

Make slices \u00bc inch apart in one direction, then repeat the same process in the other direction. By slicing in perpendicular lines you create pieces that are roughly even in size, which will allow for even cooking time. Bend your fingers while cutting an onion, which keeps the tips of your fingers away from the blade edge."

Cut the ginger into small pieces by making even cuts first in one direction, then again perpendicular to the first cut. Your ginger root should be smooth and unblemished. When selecting your root at the store, avoid any that are wrinkled, soft to the touch, or visibly molding. If you have leftover ginger, wrap it tightly in plastic and store it or put it in the freezer."
