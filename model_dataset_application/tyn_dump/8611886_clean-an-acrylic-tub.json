          "description":"If your acrylic tub is heavily stained or dirty, consider filling the tub with hot water and vinegar. This will help loosen the dirt and grime before you clean the tub. Fill the tub with hot water and pour in 2 cups (470 mL) of vinegar. Let it sit for about 15 minutes and then drain the tub. The acid in the vinegar will help loosen the dirt without damaging the acrylic tub."

          "headline":"Sprinkle the tub with baking soda.",
          "description":"Sprinkle baking soda all over the tub while it's still wet. If you didn't fill the tub with hot water and vinegar, just pour or spray water along the inside and sides of the tub. Let the baking soda sit on the tub for a few minutes. The baking soda can clean mold, mildew, and soap scum. It's also gentle to use on the acrylic tub. For a stronger cleanser, you could use borax instead of baking soda."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Scrub the acrylic tub.",
          "description":"Dip a soft cloth or sponge into water and scrub the baking soda in the tub. The baking soda will form a bit of a paste as you clean the tub. Ensure that you're using a non-abrasive sponge or you may scratch the acrylic tub. Gently scrub the entire tub. Avoid using scrubbers or sponges that have a rough side designed for heavy-duty cleaning. Instead, look for a gentle sponge or just use a soft cloth."

          "description":"If you have hard to reach edges or places where the tub meets fixtures (like the faucets), get an old toothbrush and scrub the spots. The toothbrush will be gentle enough to remove tough dirt and grime. You can also use a long-handled scrub brush, as long as the bristles are soft."

          "headline":"Rinse the tub and treat any stains with lemon.",
          "description":"Fill a bucket with water and pour it over the tub to rinse away the baking soda and dirt. Continue rinsing until the tub is clean. If you notice stains, rub half of a lemon over the stains until they lift. Rinse the stains with water and wipe them dry with a soft cloth. Lemon works well for removing hard-water deposits."

Just wet a soft cloth or sponge with antibacterial dish soap and use it to scrub the entire tub. Rinse the tub to completely remove the dirt and soap.

Read labels to find a tub cleaner that's safe to use on acrylic. You can also check with your tub manufacturer for a list of approved commercial cleaners to use on the tub.

Let the cleaner sit on the tub for 30 seconds to a few minutes. Rinse the cleanser off and wipe the tub dry with a soft cloth. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the tub."

You should also avoid using abrasive sponges that can scratch or damage the acrylic tub. If you're unsure if a product is safe to use, only use it if it says it's safe to use on acrylic surfaces."
