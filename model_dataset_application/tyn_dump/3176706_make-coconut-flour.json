A power hand drill is one of the easiest ways to cut a hole into the coconut, but if you do not have one, you could also use a corkscrew, screwdriver, or metallic skewer, instead. Worst case scenario, you can use a hammer and a nail. Pound the nail into the coconut using the hammer. Then, using the back end of the hammer to lift the nail back out, creating a hole. Create your hole in one of the three \"eyes\" of the coconut. These spots are the thinnest spot on the outer shell and the easiest to drill through. It may help to hold the coconut on a non-slip surface, like a cutting board or kitchen towel, to prevent it from slipping around as you attempt to drill through it."

For best results, place the coconut on a cement floor, sidewalk, or other equally hard surface. Do not use a kitchen counter since you may accidentally damage the counter as you strike the coconut. Use as much force as possible to strike the coconut in the direct middle. Some will open quickly, while others may take more effort. You could also open the coconut by striking its center on a sharp rock or by sawing it in half with a hand saw.

Cut through the meat by making a cut from the inside all the way through to the shell. Use your fingers or the tip of the knife to pry the meat off the shell in chunks. To make the process easier, cut the meat into v-shaped sections or cross-hatched sections, creating pieces inside the shell that can be readily removed. You might be able to wedge a metal spoon or dull knife in between the meat and the shell without making any slices through the center of the meat. If you can, try lifting the meat away from the shell after wedging the utensil in the gap."
