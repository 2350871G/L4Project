Pry up old, rickety boards and cut new ones to go in their place. Attach the replacement boards with the same type of fastener that was used the first time around. To ensure that your deck ends up with a uniform appearance after staining, pick out a type of lumber with a similar color, texture, and grain pattern. If your deck is need of more extensive repairs, it may be a good idea to hire a contractor to come out and fix it up.Tip: Pull up loose nails and sink deck screws in their place. The slightly larger screws will fit snugly in holes that have expanded over the years."

Work your sanding tool over any worn or splintered sections you come across in wide, easy circles circles to blend the edges with the surrounding wood. Watch out for uneven edges around corners, nail holes, and the lines where 2 boards meet. Be careful not to sand down the surface too much. Doing so could create shallow depressions, causing rainwater to pool on your deck."
