Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for another 1 minute, again stirring frequently. The onions should be tender and fragrant when done. The garlic should be toasted and fragrant when ready. Garlic cooks faster than onion, so the two should not be added simultaneously. Moreover, garlic burns easily, so you will need to keep a close eye on it to prevent that from happening."

    "Make sure that the bowl is shallow enough and wide enough for you to place a piece of steak in.",
    "Sift the ingredients together to ensure that they are well-combined.",
    "Coat the steak pieces with the flour mixture.",
    "Add the steak to the flour in your bag and close the bag again.",
    "Give the bag another good shake so that all sides of each piece get coated in flour and seasonings.",
    "If using a bowl instead of a bag, add the steak pieces to the seasoned flour in the bowl and turn them over a few times, dredging all the sides completely.",
    "Brown the steak in the hot, melted butter.",
    "Add the steak to the hot butter and cook for about 3 minutes on both sides, or until both sides of the steak turn brown on both sides.",
    "You could skip the skillet steps from a technical standpoint, but they are strongly recommended.",
    "Browning the steak before cooking it in a slow cooker enhances the flavor.",
    "Once brown, remove the steak from the skillet and place the pieces directly in the slow cooker.",
    "Add the sauce ingredients to the skillet.",
    "Add the beef broth, onion slices, onion soup mix, brown sugar, allspice, ginger, mushrooms, and bay leaf to the skillet.",
    "Add any remaining flour, as well.",
    "Bring to a slow boil, stirring continuously with a whisk, for about 5 minutes.",
    "Cooking the sauce in a skillet beforehand is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea.",
    "Adding the liquid ingredients to the pan and stirring the contents allows you to deglaze the bottom and pick up all the brown, flavorful bits previously stuck to the pan.",
    "The flour can also cause the sauce to thicken once it boils.",
    "Pour the sauce over the steak in the slow cooker.",
    "Make sure that each of the steak pieces is evenly submerged in the sauce.",
    "Cover and cook on low for 7 hours.",
    "Once done, the steak should be very tender.",
    "Slow cooking round steak in liquid is another great cooking method to use.",
    "Round steaks tend to be fairly lean and not very tender, and the ultra slow cooking provided by a slow cooker helps the meat break down more, making it very tender when done.",
    "The liquid it cooks in prevents the beef from drying out, as well.",
    "Serve warm.",
    "Remove the steak from the slow cooker and transfer to individual serving plates.",
    "Ladle some of the sauce over each piece of meat before enjoying.",
    "Note that you should remove the bay leaf before dishing out the steaks and sauce."
