  "text":" Building Your Tower Fill a bucket or terracotta pot halfway with stones. You can gather small stones from around your yard or purchase them from a local plant nursery. Continue adding rocks until the the container is about one-third to halfway full. The size of your bucket or pot can vary depending on whether you grow larger or smaller plants. Your container can be as small as  16 inch (40 cm) wide pot or as large as a five gallon bucket. Insert a wire mesh cylinder lengthwise into the stones. The length ration between your container and the cylinder should be between 1:2-1:3, with the cylinder being longer. Make sure that the bottom portion of the wire mesh is completely covered by the stones. Wiggle the cylinder around to check for looseness. Add peat or sphagnum moss into the wire mesh cylinder. Moss keeps the soil moist. With peat or sphagnum moss on the bottom of your tower garden, you will not have to water as frequently. Fill the cylinder with about 2-3 inches (5-7 cm). Layer potting soil on top of the peat moss. Fill the rest of the mesh cylinder with about 4-5 inches (10-13 cm) of potting soil. Layer this directly on top of the moss. Choose soils that retain moisture and nutrients, like silt or loamy soil. You will layer more moss into the tower garden as you add plants later on. Adding Plants Incorporate flowers, fruits, or herbs into your tower garden. A full variety of plants can grow well in a tower garden.

Water your garden weekly or whenever your plants look yellowing or crisp to the touch. Once or twice a week, stick a finger into your tower garden's soil. If the soil is dry, your plants need to be watered. Water your plants with compost tea once or twice a month.

Worm castings tea can work as an alternative. Watch for signs of disease. Take note of wilting, yellowing/browning, blighted or mildewing plants. Disease can spread quickly in close quarters, so either treat or remove infected plants before your entire garden is weakened. Check periodically for pests and weeds. For the most part, tower gardens have less trouble with invasive plants and insects. This is thanks to the limited soil space and distance from the ground.
