For guidance in where to bend, see the bend lines provided in the image. Cut a slit into each end of the cardboard piece. The slit at one end should be on the bottom corner, while the slit at the other end should be on the top corner. See the image for the precise locations of the slits. These slits allow for clipping into each other to form a locked triangle when folded in place. Make the triangle. Fold the cardboard piece to make two triangles in exactly the same way. When done, you should have something that looks like the triangles in the image. Make a halfway cut at the arrow marks shown in the image, on both triangles. Clip the two triangles together. Refer to the image to help you with the over-locking. Making the seat Take a large piece of cardboard and place it under the stool base.  Draw a line around it to help you see what you have to cut out when the stool base is removed.  Cut the seat out. By following the line you'd drawn in place, it should fit perfectly on your stool. Glue the seat onto the stool. Allow to try firmly. Test out the stool. Sit on it gently and enjoy making your own easy furniture.",
