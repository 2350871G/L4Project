Set the sauce aside once you finish mixing it. If you plan on preparing the rest of the yakisoba immediately, it should hold at room temperature. Alternatively, you can save time by using commercially prepared yakisoba sauce instead of making your own. When using commercially prepared sauce, you may need anywhere between 8 and 12 Tbsp (120 and 180 ml) total."

          "description":"Cut the onion, carrot, cabbage, and green onion into small, bite-size pieces. Slice the onion into long strips and the carrot into julienned strips. The green onion should be chopped into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces, and the cabbage should be chopped into 2 inch (5 cm) squares. The vegetables used in this recipe are among the most commonly used for yakisoba, but many yakisoba recipes also include other vegetables. As you get more comfortable making the dish, consider adding some other vegetables to your own version, too. Good options worth considering may include red bell pepper, green bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, snap peas, baby corn, bean sprouts, and water chestnuts."

If using chicken, cut each chicken breast into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes. Pork and chicken are the most common meats used in yakisoba, but you can experiment with other options, as well. Thinly sliced steak is fairly popular, as is chopped shrimp. Treat these other meats the same way you would treat pork or chicken in this recipe."

Depending on the thickness of the meat, expect to spend 4 to 7 minutes browning it. Don't worry about checking the inside of the meat. It will continue to cook as you add the remaining ingredients, so as long as you brown all sides during this step, it should be safely and thoroughly cooked by the end of the recipe."

Other hard vegetables you may end up using include broccoli, baby corn, and water chestnuts. Generally, you'll need to cook the onion and any other hard vegetable for 1 to 2 minutes during this step. These vegetables only need to start wilting at this point in the recipe. If you allow the onions to become translucent now, they might become too soggy or brown by the end of the cooking process."

Other soft vegetables you may end up using include sliced or chopped bell pepper, diced zucchini, snap peas, and bean sprouts.

Running the noodles under hot water should help separate any that were stuck together in the package. If the water alone does not separate the noodles, gently separate them with your fingers. Note that most yakisoba noodles are actually chukamen noodles, a type of Chinese-style egg noodle. These noodles should not be confused with standard soba noodles, which are made from buckwheat flour. If you do not have yakisoba noodles, you could technically make this dish with standard dried spaghetti. Boil the spaghetti according to package directions until it is \"al dente.\" Do this immediately before cooking the rest of the yakisoba ingredients, then add the noodles to the wok and treat as yakisoba noodles from that point on."
