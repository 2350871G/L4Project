          "description":"Use a knife or spoon to cut or scoop the stems and leaves off of the top of the berries. Your goal is to remove any lingering bits of green. Once all of the berries have been hulled, pour the berries into a large mixing bowl. Use a large wooden spoon to crush the berries so that they turn into a clumpy mush. Crushing the berries releases the little bit of pectin that they contain naturally. You should have about six cups of crushed berries after the mushing process. You can also chop the strawberries up into quarters rather than crushing them."

Pour the crushed strawberries into a large cooking pot and add the pectin-sugar mixture. If you don\u2019t want to use pectin, you will have to use about seven cups of sugar in your recipe. Your jam might be a little runnier than normal jams."

The foam is just jam that is stuffed full of air so you can leave it on the mixture if you want--it is harmless. Scoop the foam off and put it in a bowl if you want to use it later. You can actually recover the foam, making it back into jam that you can use right away."

Once the spoon as chilled, scoop a spoonful of the jam \u2018juice\u2019--the liquid part of the jam--and let it cool off to room temperature on the spoon. When it is room temperature, check its consistency. If it has thickened up nicely, you are good to go.
