          "description":"Take the butter out of the fridge about 10 minutes before you intend to work with it, and cut it into 1/4 in (6.45 mm) pieces. Cold butter does not blend well when mixed and will leave chunks of butter throughout the finished product. While \"room temperature\" is standard advice, slightly cooler than room temperature is actually better. Once the butter reaches about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), it's too warm to retain much air, which can result in denser baked goods. For best results, test the temperature using a digital thermometer. If you don't have one, you can test the butter by giving it a poke with your fingers; if the butter is soft as a ripe peach and your fingers easily leave an indentation, it's ready to use. However, if the butter is squishy and shiny it has probably started to melt, which is not ideal for creaming. Place the butter back in the fridge for 5 to 10 minutes until it firms up a little."

To microwave:\nCut the cold butter into even sized chunks (this will ensure that they soften evenly), place the chunks in a microwave safe bowl and heat for no more than 10 seconds. Take the bowl out and check the butter - if it is still too hard, place it back in the microwave for 5 seconds at a time."

The purpose of adding it slowly is to allow you to work it into the butter so that it dissolves and doesn't leave lumps or granules of sugar in the mixture. As the sugar is beaten, it cuts through the butter, leaving bubbles of air behind. This aerates the mixture, allowing it to rise and giving the final product a light, fluffy texture. Most recipes will call for caster or superfine sugar when creaming butter. This is because superfine sugar has the perfect consistency for creaming - it has enough of a surface area that it will adequately aerate the butter as it is beaten (unlike powdered sugar), but it is fine enough that it will not give a coarse texture to cakes and cookies (unlike granulated sugar)."

Be careful not the over-mix the butter and sugar. Once the mixture is pale and creamy, and forms slight, soft peaks, you should stop beating. If you keep mixing, it will lose most of the air you worked in and the final product will not rise very well.
