This is a great activity for kids. Place 1/4 cup (2 oz.) of granulated sugar into a small, zipper top baggie. Add 3 to 4 drops of food color of your choice. Zip the top closed, and shake the bag around to distribute the color. Repeat for as many colors as you want. More drops of food coloring will result in more vibrant colors, fewer drops will appear more pastel. After your cookies have been cut and placed on the cookie sheet, sprinkle the sugar over the top of the cookie in any design or pattern you like. Bake the cookies as directed in the recipe."
