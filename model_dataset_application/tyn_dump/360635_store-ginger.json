When compared to other methods, such as storing the ginger in a paper bag or wrapping it with a paper towel and then placing it in the bag, this method came up lasting the longest by quite a few weeks. If the ginger is already peeled, this method will work too, but it won't last as long as it would with the peel on."

Vodka and sherry are the most popularly used spirits, and vodka has been shown to have the longest-lasting results while altering the flavor of the ginger the least. Though this is a solid storage method, be aware that the liquid will change the flavor of the ginger a bit -- or a lot."
