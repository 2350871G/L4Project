Order a new cartridge by noting the manufacturer\u2019s name and the faucet\u2019s model number. The name is usually printed somewhere on the faucet handle. The model number can sometimes be found on the faucet as well, such as on a tag tied to the cold water line. The water lines are located underneath the sink for a sink faucet and in the wall for a showerhead. They won\u2019t always be accessible, so look in the owner\u2019s manual for the model number as well.

If that isn\u2019t an option, locate the main shut-off valve in your home instead. It will be on the lowest floor of your home, close to the water heater. If you\u2019re having a hard time finding the valves, follow the water lines. For example, find where the main water line enters your home. Follow it to the water meter and the shut-off valve. The main shut-off valve can vary. It could be a colored wheel that you rotate or a handle that you position horizontally to stop the water flow. It may also be outside of your home."

    "Reach in with a pair of needle nose pliers, then lift it to pop it out of the slot.",
    "Pull it toward you to remove it, then dispose of it in the trash.",
    "Some faucets have a nut instead of a clip.",
    "If you see a ring around the cartridge but no clip, use pliers or a wrench to turn the nut counterclockwise.",
    "Once it comes loose, slide it off the wall.",
    "Remove the cartridge by gripping it with a pair of pliers.",
    "Once everything else is out of the way, the cartridge isn\u2019t tough to remove.",
    "Grip the stem, then attempt to pull it toward you.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t come out right away, take a closer look at it.",
    "Some cartridges have to be rotated slightly to align with a slot in the wall before they can be removed.",
    "The cartridge is recognizable because of its column-like stem jutting out from the wall.",
    "The cartridge\u2019s base is round and fits inside the wall opening.",
    "The cartridge is usually made of brass, which has a yellow coloring.",
    "Some cartridges are made of silvery steel or white plastic instead.",
    "Install the new cartridge by aligning it with the wall opening.",
    "Check the cartridge stem to see if it has a notch on it.",
    "If the notch is present, align it with the groove in the wall slot.",
    "Then, slide the cartridge in with pliers or a wrench.",
    "Make sure it is plugged all the way in before putting anything else on top of it.",
    "If the new cartridge came with a packet of grease, rub it onto the cartridge before putting it back.",
    "The grease protects the cartridge from damage during the installation.",
    "You could also apply your own plumber\u2019s grease to it.",
    "Replace the remaining parts to finish the installation.",
    "Replace the parts one by one in reverse order from how you took them out.",
    "Start with the retaining clip or nut, tightening it after putting it back.",
    "Return any stem coverings next, followed by the screw-on handle adapter.",
    "When you\u2019re done, add the handle and screw it into place.",
    "Test the faucet afterward.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t seem to be working the way you want, check all of the parts to ensure they are undamaged and have been put back correctly."
