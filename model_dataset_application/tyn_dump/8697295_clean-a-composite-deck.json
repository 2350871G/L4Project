          "description":"Keep your deck clear of dirt and debris with frequent sweeping. Depending on how much traffic your deck gets and what the current season is, you may want to sweep once a day, or every few days. At minimum, sweep it once per week. If you have a very large deck, a leaf blower may be ideal. If you have one, a shop vacuum works well for getting dirt and debris from between the decking boards using the crevice tool and the brush attachments."

          "description":"Hose your deck off thoroughly with a water hose fitted with a good variable fan spray nozzle to loosen and remove surface debris. Mix warm water and mild dish soap in a bucket. Use a soft bristled brush and the cleaning solution to scrub your deck clean. Make sure to get down in the crevices and corners thoroughly. Use your water hose to rinse away the soap. This will also get rid of any mold or mildew growing on your deck. Make sure you do this, at minimum, twice per year."

          "headline":"Use a pressure washer.",
          "description":"This isn\u2019t more effective than scrubbing by hand, but it\u2019s much faster. If you have a large deck, you may prefer this approach. Use a pressure washer with no greater than 3100 psi and make sure it has a fan attachment and soap dispenser. Spray down your deck with the mild soap. Use a soft bristled brush to scrub the boards. Use the fan attachment to spray each individual deck board and rinse away the soap and debris. Pressure washers can damage the boards of your deck if they're not used carefully. Never point or spray the full pressure at yourself, another person, or pets. Small pieces of flying debris can also cause harm or damage. Stay at least 8 inches (20.32 cm) away from the deck surface at all times and spray in the direction of the wood grain to avoid possible damage. Make sure you rinse away the soap thoroughly; otherwise, it may leave a film on the deck surface."

Address the oily stain as soon as you notice it; the longer it sits on the surface of your deck, the more difficult it will be to remove. Use a soft bristled brush and soapy water to scrub at the stain. Rinse the soap away thoroughly with hot water. If the oil based stain has set and mild dish soap isn\u2019t removing it, try an oil stain remover product like OSR or Pour-N-Restore. You can buy these products at home improvement stores."

Sweep the deck free of all dirt and debris. Make sure the surface is completely dry and then apply a deck brightener product that contains oxalic acid on the surface of your deck.

This allows the water to drain off the deck and into the soil without the wooden planks being forced to sit in the soggy ground. There should never be standing water underneath your deck. If you notice standing water underneath, you may need to use a different grade of soil around your deck to improve drainage."

Pollen, leaves, dirt and other debris often get lodged in between the wooden planks. It\u2019s easy to overlook this debris since it can\u2019t be seen by glancing over the surface. Make sure you inspect the gaps and keep the spaces between the deck boards clean and free of debris.",
