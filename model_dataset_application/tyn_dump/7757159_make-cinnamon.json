To harvest cinnamon from outdoor trees, the weather must stay above 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) year round. Cinnamon trees can easily be grown indoors or in warm greenhouses. This is usually the best option for harvesting your own cinnamon."

          "description":"Cinnamon trees do best in full sunlight. The more sunlight you can provide, the better off your plant will be. For cinnamon trees grown indoors, try using grow lights if you can\u2019t find a spot that gets adequate sunlight. Cinnamon trees generally will survive in partial sunlight, which is areas exposed to direct sunlight for 3 to 6 hours a day."

Seeds need to be planted in soil within about a week of receiving them, or else they may no longer be viable. Mature cinnamon trees produce seeds. You can pick the seeds when they turn black and plant them in suitable soil. Rarely, you may find cuttings for sale. Another way to get a cutting is to take a stem and root system from a growing cinnamon tree."

          "description":"Cinnamon trees are susceptible to root rot, so avoid soil that retains lots of water. Plant the tree in sandy soil outdoors. In addition, the soil needs to have a pH level between 4.5 and 5.5. Test the soil before planting to keep your cinnamon tree healthy. For indoor plants, get an acidic potting mix from your local gardening center. You can also make your own mix by combining 1 part sphagnum peat moss and 1 part perlite. Put the mix in a glazed pot with drainage holes on the bottom. To test outdoor soil, watch the soil after a heavy rain or watering session. If water pools on the soil for hours, it is too damp. Mixing in paver sand may help. Use a test kit to test the soil\u2019s pH. Make the soil more acidic by adding organic compost and sulfur if necessary."

If you\u2019re planting the seeds indoors, put them in pots at least 18 in (46 cm) wide and 20 in (51 cm) deep. The best time to plant new seeds is in early spring, right after the frost fades from the ground. If you plan on planting seeds in the ground, make holes about 12 in (30 cm) wide and deep. Leave about 4 in (10 cm) between each cluster. Cuttings are planted similarly to seeds. Dig a small hole, then position the root end in it and backfill it with soil."

Cinnamon trees do best in dry soil. Test the soil by pushing your finger or a metal pole in the ground. Add water if the soil is dry more than 2 in (5.1 cm) down from the surface. You may need to water your trees more than once a week. They need more water during particularly hot, dry conditions.

Spread the fertilizer about 10 in (25 cm) around the tree, if possible. Adding fertilizer to the soil keeps the trees healthy so they produce lots of delicious cinnamon for you to harvest. A balanced fertilizer will have a label like 10-10-10, which represents the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in it. When the trees mature after 2 to 3 years of growth, double the amount of fertilizer to keep them healthy."

When this happens, the tree needs to be moved to a bigger pot filled with fresh acidic soil mix. Get the next pot size up, which is usually 14 in (36 cm). To move your tree, loosen the edges of the soil with a gardening trowel and pull the plant out carefully. Gradually increase the pot size as the tree grows. Cinnamon trees can need pots as wide as 24 in (61 cm). The trees can grow up to 8 ft (2.4 m) tall if you don\u2019t trim them. You can keep your cinnamon tree in its original pot longer by trimming it constantly to about 3 ft (0.91 m) in height. You will end up with less cinnamon but a more manageable tree."

Treatments like Permethrin often work well, but read the label to make sure it targets insects inside tree bark. For your safety, wear protective gear, including long clothing, rubber gloves, and a respirator mask. If your plant is indoors, make sure the pesticide you use is labeled as safe for indoor use.

Treat these by spraying a fungicide around the diseased area as soon as possible. Selectively pruning your tree is also useful for preventing the spread of damage. Cut off the damaged areas with a pruning knife and shears. Brown spots from root rot are due to too much water.

Cut down diagonally at a 30-degree angle for an easier time severing the stem. Doing this causes the tree to grow shoots that produce more cinnamon. The cut stem will have cinnamon in it, so don\u2019t throw it away! Harvest it by scoring the bark and peeling it off with a pruning knife. You can prune cinnamon trees whenever you want.

They look like smaller versions of the old stem and will grow over time. After they reach full size, you can then harvest their bark for cinnamon. Be sure to collect black seeds if you plan on growing more cinnamon trees. They don\u2019t last for very long, so plant them as soon as possible. Then you can make cinnamon every year."

    "You can prune cinnamon trees whenever you want.",
    "Use a sharp knife or shears to snip off side branches and keep the tree within its designated planting area.",
    "Maintain the plant for 2 years until the shoots are 5 ft (1.5 m) tall.",
    "You will need to continue watering the plant sparingly and adding fertilizer every week as usual.",
    "Eventually, a series of new shoots grow up around the stem you cut.",
    "They look like smaller versions of the old stem and will grow over time.",
    "After they reach full size, you can then harvest their bark for cinnamon.",
    "Be sure to collect black seeds if you plan on growing more cinnamon trees.",
    "They don\u2019t last for very long, so plant them as soon as possible.",
    "Then you can make cinnamon every year.",
    "Harvesting the Cinnamon Chop down mature shoots and divide them into pieces 3 in (7.6 cm) long.",
    "Use a pruning knife or another tool to cut the shoot near the soil.",
    "Do this only after allowing the tree to grow for 2 years.",
    "For the highest quality cinnamon, make sure the tree is at least 5 ft (1.5 m) tall before harvesting it.",
    "Score the bark horizontally, then make a vertical cut.",
    "Use a sharp pruning knife to make the cuts.",
    "You will need to cut all the way around the sticks at both ends.",
    "Cut down through the hard, outer layer of bark, stopping when your knife reaches the spongier, whiter layer of wood beneath it.",
    "Then, make a long cut lengthwise, connecting the score marks.",
    "To make harvesting the bark as easy as possible, make long cuts on both sides of the stick so you can scrape the bark off in 2 even pieces.",
    "Scrape the bark off with a knife.",
    "Slide the edge of the knife into the long, vertical cut you made on the bark.",
    "Carefully pull the knife back to peel the bark back from the shoot.",
    "If the shoot is young, the bark will peel off without much trouble.",
    "Set the bark aside in a safe spot.",
    "Mature shoots, which are at least 3 years old, are much harder to peel.",
    "Keep working at it until the bark is free.",
    "Scrape off any of the light-colored wood that sticks to the bark.",
    "Lay the bark out in the sun to dry for up to a week.",
    "The brown bark is cinnamon.",
    "Put it in a warm spot with plenty of air circulation, such as on a countertop.",
    "Leave it in direct sunlight if possible to make it dry faster.",
    "The bark will turn orange and curl up as it dries.",
    "You can leave the bark outdoors during warm, dry days.",
    "After about 3 hours, consider bringing the bark indoors to finish drying.",
    "Store cinnamon sticks in an airtight container for up to 1 year.",
    "Move the cinnamon into a glass container or spice jar if you have them available.",
    "Make sure the container is sealed tightly so the cinnamon doesn\u2019t lose potency.",
    "To keep the cinnamon as fresh as possible, store it in a cool, dry place like a pantry cupboard.",
    "Use the cinnamon while its flavor is strong.",
    "You can grind up the cinnamon sticks with a microplane, but keep in mind ground cinnamon loses its flavor faster than stick cinnamon.",
    "Try keeping the cinnamon in stick form until you need it."
