Once the water boils, turn off the heat and put the lid on the pot. Let the eggs stay in the pan for 12 minutes. They'll finish cooking and then you can drain the water. If you'd like to save time, you could purchase eggs that have already been hard-boiled and peeled."

It's important to have the eggs at room temperature. This will help the dressing emulsify (blend together) easier."

Set this aside while you prepare the rest of the dressing ingredients. If you don't have a mesh sieve, you can just combine the egg yolks with a fork although the yolks may still be a little lumpy."

          "headline":"Season the sieved egg yolks.",
          "description":"Sprinkle salt and fresh ground pepper into the bowl with the sieved egg yolks. Add one teaspoon of Dijon mustard and one teaspoon of white wine vinegar. Use a whisk to combine the egg yolk mixture until it's smooth. You can use your favorite vinegar for a slightly different flavor."

Slowly pour in 1 cup (236 ml) of sunflower or canola oil while you constantly whisk the dressing. The dressing will start to thicken as it emulsifies. If you add the oil too quickly, it will separate and float to the top."
