    "Rinsing the filter first ensures a better-tasting cup of coffee.",
    "Bottled or filtered water will give you the best tasting coffee, but tap water will work fine if that's all you have on hand.",
    "Situate the filter into the Aero Press's cap and put it over your mug.",
    "Nestle the paper filter into the filter slot located in the press's cap.",
    "Once it's in place, put the Aero Press right on top of your coffee mug.",
    "The press is made to fit over a mug perfectly.",
    "Dribble a small bit of hot water on the filter to get it wet.",
    "You'll only need to use about .25 cups (59 ml) of water for this process, if even that amount.",
    "Aim to saturate the filter but don't pour in so much water that it starts dripping through the press.",
    "Add the pre-measured coffee grounds to the filter.",
    "All you need to do is dump the grounds into the filter opening and you're all set.",
    "Try to make the surface of the grounds as flat and even as possible once you dump them into the filter.",
    "To flatten the surface of the grounds, shake the filter gently so the grounds settle.",
    "You can also just use a spoon the smooth out the surface.",
    "Pour in the rest of the hot water and stir the coffee mixture 1 time.",
    "Dump the rest of the water out of the kettle into the filter, right on top of the coffee grounds.",
    "Then, use a spoon or paddle stirrer to give the coffee mixture 1 brief stir.",
    "Avoid stirring vigorously\u20141 brief stir is all you need.",
    "Insert and engage the plunger to brew your cup of coffee.",
    "Put the plunger right over the coffee and water mixture and press down on the plunger until you hear a hissing sound.",
    "The coffee will brew straight into your coffee mug.",
    "The hissing sound simply indicates that the brewing process is complete.",
    "Be sure to let the liquid cool off a little before enjoying your java!"
