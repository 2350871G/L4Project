Repeat for each gap. Push the rope in so that the top of the rope is just below the top of the floorboards. Filling Gaps with Wood Filler Clean and vacuum the floor to ensure that the wood filler will adhere. If there\u2019s a lot of dirt, dust, and other debris on your floor, the wood filler won\u2019t adhere well to the floor. Use a hose attachment to vacuum inside the gaps where you\u2019ll be applying the filler. Find a wood filler that will shrink and expand with your floorboards. Your floorboards will shrink and expand with changes in temperature and humidity over the year, so gaps between the floorboards will also change in size.

Test the wood filler on an area out of sight to see if it will match. If you\u2019re nervous about whether the color of the wood filler will match the color of your floor, test it out in an area that will be underneath a piece of furniture or in a closet. Let it sit for a day and then see how it looks. Use a plastic putty knife to apply the filler into the gaps. Put wood filler onto your putty knife and then push the filler into the gap. Then, move the putty knife across the gap as if you were painting it with a paintbrush to spread the filler evenly in the gap.

Once the wood filler is dry, use a damp, lint-free cloth to wipe excess wood filler off the floor. Try not to walk on the floor while the filler is drying. Making a Wood Dust Filler Collect fine dust from wood that is the same type as your floor.
