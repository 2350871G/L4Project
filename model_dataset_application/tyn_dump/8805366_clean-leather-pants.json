If the label states \u201cDry Clean Only\u201d or \u201cNot Washable,\u201d then you may want to consider taking it to a dry cleaner or leather specialist. If your pants do not have a label, or if you\u2019ve cut it off, and you know the manufacturer, then you may be able to contact them directly for cleaning advice.
