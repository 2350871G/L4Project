Use a spatula or spoon to stir the ingredients vigorously until they make a shaggy dough. The dough doesn\u2019t have to be completely homogenous, as you will knead it."

          "description":"Knead the dough, either by hand on a counter or table or by using the low setting on a standing mixer. To knead by hand, place the dough on the counter and begin to stretch and squeeze it, folding it over on itself and stretching it again. Keep kneading for about 5-8 minutes until the dough is smooth and expands back out when you poke it. If the dough is incredibly sticky, add a small amount of flour and rework it. Avoid adding too much flour, as this will make the dough have a thicker, heavier consistency."

          "description":"Once you have kneaded the dough into a smooth ball, pour cooking oil on a paper towel and use it to lightly oil the interior of a large bowl. Place the dough ball inside the bowl, cover the bowl with a cloth, and let the dough rise for 1-1 \u00bd hours until it is twice its size. If you are in a rush, you can skip the process of letting the dough rise and move on to preparing the pizza. Be aware that the crust of the pizza will be very thin and crisp as opposed to fluffy. If you are preparing the dough in advance for the next day, let the dough rise for 30 minutes, then place it in the fridge in a covered bowl until you are ready to use it."

Slice your favorite toppings, whether it be veggies like mushrooms or green bell peppers or meat like cooked sausage or ham. Slice about 1-2 cups (240- 480 ml) in total of the pizza toppings and put them aside."

Pour a small amount of flour onto a clean counter or cutting board, then use your hands to spread out the flour into a thin, even layer. Place one ball of dough on the counter and roll it using a rolling pin to create a circle with a diameter that is slightly smaller than the pan you will be using to cook the pizzas.

Repeat with the other dough ball. Once you\u2019ve rolled the dough, use your hands to encourage the dough into a circle shape if need be. Cooking the Pizza in a Skillet Heat a large pan. Place the pan or skillet you will be using to cook the pizza over medium high heat. Add a teaspoon or so (about 4.92 ml) of cooking oil and swirl so that the cooking oil coats the bottom of the pan. You can also use two equal sized pans if you want to cook both pizzas at the same time. Other than a skillet, you can also make stovetop pizza using a tawa, a thin metal pan common throughout parts of Asia. Cook the dough on one side.

Covering the pan traps the heat so that the cheese can melt and the toppings can cook. Cook for 4-5 minutes. Leave the pan or skillet covered for 4-5 minutes. After the five minutes are up, take the lid off the pan. If the cheese has melted and the bottom of the pizza looks golden brown, the pizza should be done. If not, replace the lid back on the pan and check every minute or so until the pizza is ready. Place the pizza on a cutting board and cool. Once the pizza is ready, use a spatula to take it out of the pan and place it on a cutting board to cool. In the meantime, make another small pizza using the other dough circle. Once both pizzas are cooked and have cooled enough to eat, slice and enjoy your pan made pizza! Grilling the Pizza Turn the grill on to 600 degrees F (315.55 C). Heat the grill up to 600 degrees F (315.55 C). Next to the grill, set up a table that can hold all of your toppings and the two pizza doughs, as well as tongs, a pastry brush, a spatula, a large spoon and an oven mitt. Choose direct as opposed to indirect heat if that is a setting on your grill. The hotness of the grill will give you crispier pizza with a deliciously charred crust that tastes almost like wood fired pizza. Brush one side of the dough with olive oil. Use a pastry brush to brush olive oil onto one side of one of the pizzas, or onto both pizzas if your grill can fit them both at the same time. Lay the dough on the grill. Lay the dough on the grill with the side coated in olive oil facing down. Try to fit both pizza doughs on the grill if you can. Coat the side facing up in olive oil as well. Cook for three minutes.
