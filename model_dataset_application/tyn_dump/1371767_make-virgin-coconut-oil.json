The pure virgin coconut oil is left in the jar. Using the Cold Process Method Start with dried or dehydrated coconut. You can buy dried unsweetened coconut flakes from the grocery store.

Continue processing the coconut until all of the flakes have been run through the juicer. Process the coconut again. The juicer won't be able to extract all of the oil the first time around, so run the coconut flakes through it once more to make sure you get every last drop. Place the coconut oil in a jar and store in a warm place. Wait 24 hours for the coconut cream to settle at the bottom of the jar. The pure coconut oil will rise to the top. Spoon the oil into a new container. Once the oil has separated from the cream and solidified, use a spoon to remove it from the first container and place it in a new container. It is now ready to use. Boiling the Coconut Heat 4 cups of water. Place the water in a saucepan and put it on a burner. Turn the burner to medium high and heat the water until it starts steaming. Grate the meat of 2 coconuts. Use a fully developed brown coconut instead of a young green one. Open the coconut, scoop out the meat and grate it into a bowl. Blend the coconut and water. Put the grated coconut in a blender. Pour the hot water over the coconut and close the lid of the blender. Hold the lid of the blender in place and puree the coconut and water into a smooth mixture.
