This is important to read, because the material of the hair and body may not allow washing. Also check the tag for customer service numbers or websites with hair care information. Some high-end dolls from large companies may have a number you can call for advice in the event that the hair becomes damaged or unmanageable. You should call customer service before attempting to wash or style to hair to avoid further damage. Synthetic hair may be rooted right into the doll\u2019s head or woven into a wig base and glued on the head.

You can also use baby shampoo or conditioner instead of fabric softener. Make sure the water isn\u2019t too hot. It could damage the hair fibers. Try to avoid getting your doll\u2019s face wet.

    "It is best to let the hair dry overnight.",
    "Do not put heat from a hair dryer on the doll\u2019s hair, especially if it is synthetic.",
    "It will cause damage.",
    "Remove frizzy or matted ends.",
    "You doll\u2019s hair may be mostly nice, but appear to have split, damaged ends.",
    "This can make the hair appear very unkempt, and detangling may not fix it.",
    "You have the option to trim the ends of the hair with a pair of sharp scissors.",
    "If you don\u2019t feel confident cutting it, you can also curl the hair to conceal frizzy ends.",
    "Make sure you cut your doll\u2019s hair evenly so you are happy with the result.",
    "Fixing Doll Hair that Requires Special Care Use caution when using water on wood or porcelain dolls.",
    "For wooden dolls, moisture that touches the doll's head may cause it to rot or mildew to form, ruining the doll.",
    "If a porcelain doll\u2019s head is cracking, water could penetrate the finish and cause the doll to completely dissolve.",
    "Always remove the hair before washing if the doll has a wig base.",
    "If the doll\u2019s hair does not have a wig base and you are unable to remove it, make sure you don\u2019t get any water on the doll\u2019s scalp when washing.",
    "Avoid using water on doll hair made of wool.",
    "Wool is not usually attached with a wig base.",
    "It is typically glued directly onto the doll\u2019s head.",
    "You never want to get wool hair wet, as water will cause matting and even loosen the glue on the doll\u2019s head.",
    "Consider cleaning the hair by brushing cornstarch or talcum powder onto it with a toothbrush and then brushing it off again.",
    "Wash human hair and mohair after removing the wig base.",
    "These hair types are almost always sewn to a  mesh wig base and glued on the doll\u2019s head.",
    "You can remove the wig base from the scalp before washing and then glue it back when you are finished.",
    "When removing the wig base, put your fingers under the wig and carefully pull it from the doll\u2019s head.",
    "If you come across a tough spot that won\u2019t come off, spray it with cold water (unless the doll is made of wood or porcelain!",
    ").",
    "Clean doll hair made of yarn with fabric softener.",
    "Yarn hair is typically found on older dolls from the late '70s and '80s and Cabbage Patch Dolls.",
    "The yarn is either sewn or glued directly onto the doll\u2019s head.",
    "Hair made out of yarn can be washed with caution: most dolls with yarn hair are made of fabric and may begin to rot or form mildew if they get wet.",
    "If you must wash yarn hair, only use fabric softener or laundry detergent intended for hand washing.",
    "Never brush yarn hair.",
    "The brush will unravel the yarn fibers, causing even more damage to the hair."
