Pick up white caulk, finishing nails, wood glue, two pieces of scrap wood and long wood screws. You will also need some paint and tools if you don\u2019t have them at home. Cutting the Frame Clear a clean work table for this project. If you don\u2019t have a beat up table, you will want to cover the top in cardboard and wrap it with a drop cloth to avoid marring the top. Lay your pegboard on top of the table, facing up. Place your crown molding across each side. The molding will intersect at the four corners. Mark the 45-degree angle where two ends intersect with a pencil. Imagine this is the corner of the frame where the two ends come together. The angle should extend from the far corner, diagonally into the point where it meets the pegboard. Repeat on all four corners. Although you should measure and mark the corners carefully, it does not have to be perfect, since you can sand and use caulk to account for discrepancies later. Remove the molding. Paint the front of your pegboard in the color of your choice. If you prefer not to have colored pegboard, you can keep it the original tan or white color and paint the molding to compliment it. Constructing the Frame Set up a miter saw. Cut at all the corners across your 45-degree pencil lines. Sand the edges slightly to remove unsightly bumps or chips. Test the corners to ensure they line up. Place the molding on the worktable. Paint them the same color as your pegboard or a complementary color. You may need two coats and a primer if they are a darker color than the board. Allow them to dry completely before continuing. Place the pegboard back on the table, facing up. Then, lay the mitered molding into position. Glue the mitered corners together with strong wood glue. Also, place a layer of wood glue across the sides of the pegboard to glue the frame on top of the board. It is easier to do both steps at once since it will need plenty of time to dry. Use clamps to hold the framed board in place overnight. Flip the board and frame over when they are dried. Hammer finish nails into the frame and board, where they won\u2019t show through the front. Use as many as possible to secure the board and frame together. Touch up the corners of the frame if needed. Apply a bead of caulk into the mitered corners and smooth it down to fill the holes. Allow it to dry, and then paint over it with the original paint color. Hanging the Framed Pegboard Find your two pieces of scrap wood. They should be at least two thirds as wide as your frame. You will use them to hang the pegboard securely, since hanging it directly into the wall can damage it. Use a stud finder tool to find the stud position on your wall. Mark a vertical line along the center of the stud with a pencil. Ask a friend to help you hold the scrap pieces of wood up on the wall about one-third the way from the bottom and one-third down from the top. They will create two parallel lines on which you can hang your pegboard. Hold the wood up and use a level to place it in the right position. Have your friend hold the scrap wood level. Grab your power drill. Screw the scrap wood into the wall with long wood screws where it intersects with your stud. Repeat in two places on each scrap of wood. You should have two level parallel supports securely installed into your wall. Get a few friends to help you hold up the framed pegboard. You should be able to find where the pegboard crossed the wood supports. Level the pegboard using your spirit level. Screw the pegboard into each wood support two to three times, through a hole in the pegboard. You may want to use a washer as well as a screw, to ensure a good distribution of weight. Insert your wire pegboard hangers. Hang your tools.",
