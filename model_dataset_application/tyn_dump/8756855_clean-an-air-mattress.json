Removing Mildew and Mold Take the mattress outside. Take the mattress outside every month or two and leave it out during a warm and sunny day. The sunlight will vaporize the moisture that has accumulated in the mattress. It will also kill any mold build-up. Use vinegar and water to remove mold. Create a mixture that is half vinegar and half water. Use one cup of white vinegar and one cup of water. Dip a sponge or cloth into the mixture and gently rub it over the air mattress. Rinse with water and allow the mattress to air dry. Mix isopropyl alcohol and water to remove mildew. Create a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and warm water in a bowl or bucket. Wet a sponge with the mixture. Use the sponge to clean the air mattress. Rinse with water and let the mattress air dry when you are finished. Apply a disinfectant. You can use any disinfectant, such as Lysol, to kill mold or mildew on your air mattress. Spray the disinfectant over the area where the mold and/or mildew appears.
