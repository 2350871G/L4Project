    "Adding Coats of Stain Apply the first coat of stain with a paintbrush or rag.",
    "After reading the instructions for mixing the stain, dip your brush or rag into it and apply an even layer with smooth, long strokes that go with the grain of the wood.",
    "Allow the stain to penetrate the wood for 5-15 minutes, depending on the depth of color you desire.",
    "Leaving the stain on for 15 minutes will produce a deeper, richer stain color than leaving it on for 5 minutes, but it might also conceal some of the natural beauty of the wood grain.",
    "It\u2019s really a matter of personal preference when it comes to choosing a brush or a rag\u2014either one will do a good job with the right technique.",
    "Wipe off excess stain that hasn\u2019t soaked into the wood after 5-15 minutes.",
    "Use clean, dry cloths and wipe in the direction of the grain.",
    "Do not allow any stain that has not penetrated the wood to dry on the surface.",
    "It will cause streaks and smears.",
    "Add additional coats if you want a deeper, darker finish.",
    "Allow the first coat to dry completely\u2014this typically takes about 4 hours, but check the product instructions.",
    "If you like the look, move on to sealing the stain.",
    "Or, if desired, add another coat of stain using the same process as before.",
    "You can add 3-4 total coats if you wish.",
    "Remember to keep wiping away the excess stain 5-15 minutes after application.",
    "Allow 4 hours between coats.",
    "Protecting the Stain with Varnish Brush on a coat of floor-grade polyurethane varnish.",
    "Follow the package instructions for stirring and applying the varnish.",
    "Unless otherwise directed, use a natural bristle paintbrush and apply a thin layer using long, even strokes.",
    "Stairs are high-traffic areas, so sealing them is essential.",
    "Remember to use a compatible varnish\u2014oil-based with an oil-based stain, or water-based with a water-based stain.",
    "Allow the varnish to dry for the recommended time, such as 4 hours.",
    "Sand the varnish lightly if you want to apply a second coat.",
    "One coat of varnish may be sufficient, in which case you\u2019re all done!",
    "However, since stairs take a beating from foot traffic, adding a second coat isn\u2019t a bad idea.",
    "Before doing this, very lightly sand the varnish with 220-grit sandpaper.",
    "Wipe away the dust with a tack cloth before proceeding.",
    "Some floor-grade polyurethanes do not require sanding between coats, especially if the second coat is applied within 12 hours of the first coat.",
    "Check the product instructions.",
    "Apply a second coat of varnish.",
    "Use the same process as before.",
    "When you\u2019re done, allow the finish to dry for at least 48 hours before using the stairs.",
    "After the drying time is complete, remove any drop cloths, painter's tape, and other materials, and enjoy your beautiful new staircase!"
