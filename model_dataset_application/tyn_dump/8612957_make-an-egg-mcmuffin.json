Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the English muffin halves with the butter side down. Toast the muffin halves for 3 to 4 minutes, so they become golden and a little crisp. Remove the toasted muffin halves to a sheet of aluminum foil so the buttered sides are facing up. If you want both sides to become crispy, just flip them over and let them toast another minute."

Use tongs to flip it over several times, so the edges crisp up. Place the Canadian bacon on top of one of the toasted English muffin halves. Watch the Canadian bacon carefully as it cooks, since it could quickly burn."

Crack one egg into the circular container and sprinkle a little salt and pepper over it. Cook the egg for about 3 minutes, so the egg sets. For a simple egg ring, just wash out a small tuna can that's empty. You can just unmold the cooked egg by turning the can over."

Quickly put the other English muffin half on top of the cheese and wrap the aluminum foil over the sandwich. This will seal in the heat and help to melt the cheese. You can eat the sandwich immediately or place the wrapped sandwich into an airtight container. You can freeze the breakfast sandwich or store it in the refrigerator for up to a day."
