If you\u2019re making a curved cut, use a compass to trace a perfect circle.Tip: If you don\u2019t want to mark your tile directly, place a straight piece of masking tape on the tile and use a marker to draw your line on it.

Fill the reservoir with water until the bottom of the blade is slightly submerged. Wet saws kick up water while you use them, so you may need to refill the reservoir if you plan on cutting multiple tiles. Since you\u2019re working electronics and water, plug the saw into a GFCI outlet. GFCI outlets will automatically turn off the power if any of the electronic components in your saw get wet."

Hold the marble tile that you\u2019re cutting against the edge of the fence to see where it lines up with your saw. Adjust the fence closer or further from the blade until your mark lines up with the saw. Saw blades usually cut out \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) from your material, so make sure your blade is on the scrap side of your line."

If you\u2019re cutting a narrow piece of tile, use a wooden guide to hold the tile from the other side. This way, the smaller piece won\u2019t break or kick back."
