If you intend to use the plant as ground cover, you will not need to install a support structure. If you would like to train the honeysuckle to climb, you will either need to plant it near an existing wall or fence, or install a trellis, stakes, wall, or fence. If you are not planting your honeysuckle near an existing fence or wall, Insert the support structure into the ground prior to planting the honeysuckle. If you install the structure after placing the plant in the ground, you may damage the root system."

If you are using the honeysuckle as ground cover, plant them between two and five feet apart. If you are training your honeysuckle, place each plant six to twelve inches away from the support structure and three to fifteen feet away from other plants. Dig a hole as deep as the plant's current root system. The hole should be two to three times wider than its container. Combine new compost into the soil you removed from the hole. Remove the honeysuckle from its container without damaging the root system. Loosen the plant's soil with your fingertips before placing it in the hole. Scoop half of the soil-compost mixture into the hole. Water the area to remove unwanted air pockets. Allow all of the water to drain. Fill in the rest of the hole with soil-compost mix. Water your transplanted honeysuckle thoroughly. If you are training your honeysuckle, attach the plant to the support structure with old nylon hosiery tied in a figure eight. The crossed part of the tie should lay between the stem and the support structure."

If you need to elevate the honeysuckle, add more soil or compost to the pot until the plant's  base reaches the lip of the container. The type of honeysuckle you choose to plant is dependent upon the size of the container you wish to use, the climate of your region, and availability at local nurseries, markets, and stores.

If this option is not available to you, you may install a trellis or set of stakes within the pot itself. You can create a makeshift cage out of three bamboo dowels and nursery wire. Insert the three dowels along the inner edge of the container at even intervals. Wrap a piece of nursery wire around the top of the three dowels.

Watch your honeysuckles closely to look for molding, mildew, bite marks, and other damage that could indicate a problem with your new plant. Powder mildew attacks plants that don't have sufficient water. Prevent it by watering your plant regularly and keeping the soil moist and well drained. Aphids feed on the leaves of the plant. They are typically treated with insecticide soaps for large infestations. However, if you only have a few of them you can spray them away with a garden hose. Other insects, including scale insects, spider mites, and caterpillars, can also impact your honeysuckles.
