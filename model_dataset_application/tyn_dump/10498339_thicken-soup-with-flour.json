If the mixture becomes too thick to stir, add a few drops of water. If your flour has lots of lumps in it, sift it before you add it to the bowl of soup. White all-purpose flour works best for thickening soup as opposed to wholemeal flour. If you have made a large pot of soup, add 2 tablespoons (16 grams) of flour."
