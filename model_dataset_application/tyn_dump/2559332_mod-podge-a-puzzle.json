Check the finished dimensions of the puzzle on the box and create a wax paper work surface that\u2019s at least 2 in (5.1 cm) bigger on all sides. For instance, if the finished puzzle has listed dimensions of 18 by 24 in (46 by 61 cm), tear off overlapping strips of wax paper to create a work surface that\u2019s at least 20 by 26 in (51 by 66 cm)\nLaying wax paper underneath the puzzle keeps sticky Mod Podge from getting all over your table, counter, desk, floor, or other puzzle-assembly surface.
