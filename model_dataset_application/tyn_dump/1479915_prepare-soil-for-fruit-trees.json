The water should drain within 3 to 4 hours, at which point you should fill the hole again with water. If the hole does not drain within 3 to 4 hours during the first and second water filling, your soil won't likely drain well enough to support a fruit tree. If your hole drains completely in less than 3 hours, the soil may be too sandy. To improve this, add organic matter to the soil. Soil that drains poorly can be improved with a drainage system, planting mounds, or raised beds."

French drains are a kind of underground drainpipe installed to improve drainage. Once they're put in and the grass regrows, they'll be all but invisible. Generally, French drains are installed by digging a sloping trench through areas of poor drainage to a drainage area. A drainage pipe and coarse backfill, like gravel, are inserted in the trench, then covered with dirt."

Use well-composted organic materials in the backfill for tree holes to increase moisture retention while the roots establish. Rent or buy a rototiller from your local home or garden center to easily mix compost into your existing soil. After mixing in organic materials thoroughly, test the soil drainage again (water should drain in 3 to 4 hours).

By raising the planting area with a mound, the root crown will be better protected. Mounds are made by backfilling soil into holes to create a gentle slope rising to the tree in the center. The tree's soil line should be 6 to 12 in (15.2 to 30.5 cm) higher than surrounding soil. For mounds that are 6 in (15.2 cm) high, you should also use a width of at least 2.5 ft (.76 m). For mounds that are 10 or 12 in (25.4 or 30.5 cm) high, use a width between 3 and 4 ft (.9 and 1.2 m). Avoid making steep slopes with your mounds. Gentle slopes will prevent the soil from eroding."

The depth shouldn't be greater than the root ball, except when the soil is really compacted, then you'll want a little extra room.
