    "You can do this by rinsing the seeds in cool water, or by sucking on them.",
    "This gel is filled with sugars, which can encourage mold and bacteria growth.",
    "You can also peel the other white layer off to reveal a brown-colored seed.",
    "Start peeling from the pointy end.",
    "You can use your finger nail or a craft knife to nick the tip, and then peel the outer shell down.",
    "This will make it easier for the seeds to sprout and speed up the process, but is not necessary for germination to occur.",
    "Peel the brown seed cover off as well.",
    "You may notice that your seed is covered with a thin, brown film.",
    "Use your fingernail to scratch this coating off.",
    "Place the seeds onto the damp paper towel.",
    "Try to spread the seeds out as evenly as you can, so that the roots don't become tangled when they sprout.",
    "Repeat the peeling process for the rest of the seeds and place them down onto the towel.",
    "Once the seeds are on the paper towel, they should stay damp.",
    "If you notice them starting to get dry out, consider covering the paper towel with another damp paper towel, or folding the first one overtop of them.",
    "Slip the paper towel into a plastic zippered or resealable bag, and close the bag tightly.",
    "Don't use a plastic grocery bag.",
    "You want the bag to be zippered or resealable; this will help trap the moisture and retain heat.",
    "Your seeds will need both in order to sprout.",
    "Keep the plastic bag in a dark, warm location until the seeds sprout.",
    "Keep the temperature between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "It will take one to two weeks.",
    "Some seedlings will need up to three weeks to sprout.",
    "Transplant the seedlings when the tails are about 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) long.",
    "Make a shallow hole (a half inch deep) in a pot of damp, well-drained soil, and tuck the seedling, tail-side-down into the hole.",
    "Gently pat the soil around the seedling.",
    "Move the pot to a warm, sunny location.",
    "Remember to water the plant and to keep the soil damp; do not allow the soil to become soggy or dry.",
    "Click here to learn how to take care of your seedling.",
    "Taking Care of Your Seedling Water your plant regularly, about 2 or 3 times per week.",
    "When the seedling has 4 developed leaves, let the surface of the soil become dry before you water again.",
    "Don't let the soil dry out completely, however; it should be moist if you stick your finger into it.",
    "Make sure that it gets enough sunlight.",
    "Lemon trees require at least eight hours of sunlight.",
    "Seedlings will require 10 to 14 hours.",
    "You may have to place a grow light next to your tree to ensure that it gets enough sunlight.",
    "You can purchase grow lights from gardening shops and nurseries.",
    "Know when to transplant your seedling.",
    "Eventually, your seedling will outgrow its pot.",
    "When the seedling reaches 1 year old, transfer it to a 6 inch (15.24 centimeter) wide pot.",
    "Eventually, you will need to move your plant to a pot that is 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) wide and 10 to 16 inches (25.4 to 40.64 centimeters) deep.",
    "A good rule of thumb to determine when it's time to transplant is to look under the pot.",
    "If you can see roots through the drainage holes, it is time for a new, bigger pot.",
    "Maintain the soil pH level.",
    "Lemon trees like soil that is slightly acidic.",
    "The pH should be between 5.7 and 6.5.",
    "You can measure this with a pH testing kit, which you can purchase from a gardening shop or a nursery.",
    "A good way to lower the acidity of the soil is by watering the plant once a month with some cold black coffee or tea (with no milk or sugar added).",
    "However, make sure that you continue to monitor the pH until it has reached the ideal range.",
    "Remember to provide your tree with proper nutrients so that it grows healthy and strong.",
    "You can either dig a trench around the tree and fill it with dry compost, or you can water it with a water soluble fertilizer.",
    "Here are some ways in which you can provide your tree with the nutrition it needs:\nFertilize your lemon tree twice a year with an organic fertilizer, such as compost or vermicompost.",
    "Water your plant every 2 to 4 weeks with a water soluble fertilizer.",
    "It should be high in potassium and magnesium.",
    "If your tree is going to stay indoors, purchase a general indoor plant fertilizer.",
    "It should contain micronutrients.",
    "Water your tree once a month with a solution made from 1 tablespoon of Epsom salts and \u00bd gallon (1.89 liters) of water.",
    "If your tree is still very small, you might not need so much water.",
    "Instead, water the plant as much as you need to, then save the leftover water for the next month.",
    "Understand that it will take some time before your tree can bear fruit.",
    "Some lemon trees will produce fruit in as little as five years.",
    "Others will requires as many as 15 years.",
    "If you have an indoor lemon tree, you'll also need to pollinate it by hand before it will bear fruit.",
    "Bees typically take care of this when your lemon tree is planted outside, though."
