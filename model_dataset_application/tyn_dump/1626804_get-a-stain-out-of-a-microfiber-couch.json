Water that has soaked into microfiber fabric often causes a darkening of that area. Work the rubbing alcohol gently into that area. Food Stain Removal Soak up excess liquid with white paper towels immediately after the stain was created.  Put a drop of hand dish washing soap, like Dawn, on a white cloth.  Pour 1 drop of water on the liquid to activate it.  Rub gently on the microfiber food stain until it is removed. This should work on oil-based food.

Let it sit for 5 minutes to soak up any liquid.  Vacuum up the soiled baking soda.  Reapply baking soda if the spill or smell remains. This method should work for urine stains.
