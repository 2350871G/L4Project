Any other bits that find their way into the oven may interfere with the finished texture. For this recipe, you'll want to use about 1\u00bd cups (340 g, or roughly a pound) of fresh berries. Be careful not to cut away too much usable fruit. This can significantly reduce the size of the dried strawberries, as they will already shrink quite a bit in the oven."

Use a gentle scooping motion to toss the strawberries from the bottom. Continue tossing until the pieces are evenly coated. Feel free to use more or less sugar as you like. If the strawberries are already ripe and juicy, they may not need any at all. Use only granulated white sugar. Other types of sugar, like natural sugar substitutes and artificial sweeteners, might not provide the same results."

This will result in sweeter fruit with a more even consistency throughout. Drawing some of the juices out of the strawberries will allow them to dry faster and more thoroughly.

A low heat is needed to dehydrate the strawberries without scorching them or breaking down the sugars too much and causing them to become mushy.

Heaping the pieces or letting them overlap could cause them to clump and add to their overall drying time. It may be necessary to prepare a second batch if your baking sheet isn\u2019t big enough to hold all of the strawberries at once."

If a lot of juice has collected at the bottom of the baking sheet, you can go ahead and drain it while you have it out of the oven. Always grab a potholder or oven mitt anytime you\u2019re handling hot cookware."
