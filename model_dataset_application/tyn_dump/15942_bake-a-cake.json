    "Bake the cake for about 50 minutes.",
    "Put the cake pan on a baking sheet to keep your oven clean in case of spills.",
    "Rotate the cake pan 180 degrees after 25 minutes.",
    "The cake is ready when the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.",
    "Serve the cake with whipped cream, if desired.",
    "Following Cake Recipes Start by reading the ingredient list and directions before you begin.",
    "It's important to have every ingredient you need ready to go.",
    "You don't want to be running to the grocery store during preparation.",
    "The final product can flop if a key ingredient is left out.",
    "Prepare your cake pans.",
    "Be sure to have the correct size or shape of the pan.",
    "Bundt cakes require bundt pans, while others can be baked in a variety of sizes.",
    "Grease the pans to keep the cake from sticking to them.",
    "Use about 1/2 Tbsp (7 g) of butter, margarine, or vegetable shortening on a paper towel and rub the inside of the pan.",
    "Sprinkle about 1-2 Tbsp (8-16 g) of flour on top.",
    "Add a little flour to the pan, rotate it to ensure it adheres evenly, then shake and dump out any excess flour and set the pans to the side.",
    "Preheat the oven to the required temperature from the recipe.",
    "Be sure to follow the recipe, as turning the temperature higher or lower could create issues.",
    "Measure ingredients as accurately as possible and add them in the order specified.",
    "Most cake recipes begin combining wet ingredients (like eggs, oil, and milk), then adding the dry ingredients (such as flour, baking powder, cocoa).",
    "Be sure to take special prerequisites such as sifting, whisking or beating, and packing before adding the ingredients to the main bowl.",
    "Mix the cake batter as specified on the recipe.",
    "Some recipes can be mixed with a stand or hand mixer.",
    "Be cautious as steps can instruct to fold in flour or other ingredients with a rubber spatula.",
    "While mixing, stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula or spoon to ensure that everything is mixed thoroughly.",
    "Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.",
    "Fill the pans two-thirds of the way full, as the cake will rise during baking.",
    "Gently tap the cake pan on the countertop to release any large air bubbles in the batter.",
    "Place the pans on the center rack of the preheated oven.",
    "You can put the cake pan on top of a baking sheet in case any of the batter bubbles over.",
    "Do not allow the pans to touch the oven wall.",
    "Close the oven door and immediately set a timer to the specified baking time.",
    "If there's a time range, use the median or middle number (bake it for 35 minutes for a range of 34 to 36 minutes or 53 minutes for a range of 50 to 55 minutes).",
    "Using the median will ensure that the cake won't under or overcook.",
    "Resist the urge to open the oven door during baking, as the heat will escape and may cause the cake to cook unevenly.",
    "If applicable, turn the oven light on and view through the oven window.",
    "Check for cake doneness.",
    "Gently insert a toothpick or wooden skewer in the center of the cake.",
    "If it comes out clean or with a few small crumbs on it, the cake is done.",
    "If not, place it back in the oven for another 3\u20134 minutes.",
    "Keep testing for the same amount of time until you get the correct result.",
    "Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 15 to 30 minutes.",
    "Run a thin spatula around the pan edges to loosen the sides.",
    "Place the wire rack over the top of the pan, invert it, and tap it lightly to remove the cake.",
    "Let it cool completely before decorating since the heat will melt frosting and icing.",
    "Frost and decorate as desired."
