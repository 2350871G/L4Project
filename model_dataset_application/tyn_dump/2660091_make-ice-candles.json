As a precaution, however, it might be a good idea to add 1 to 2 ounces (cc to cc grams) of wax in case something spills. If you are using a block of wax, you will need to cut it up into smaller chunks first. If you are using wax pellets or shavings, you do not need to cut them up.

Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of fragrance per 1 pound (455 grams) of wax. How much dye you add depends on how dark you want the candle to be.

    "Glass is not recommended, as the expanding ice can cause it to shatter.",
    "Clean the cans well and peel off any labels.",
    "Don't worry if there is any glue residue on the cans, as this won't stick to the ice; any paper will stick, however.",
    "Fill the larger can with some water, then place smaller can inside of it.",
    "Start by filling the larger can about half-way with water, then float the smaller can inside of it.",
    "Don't worry, you can always add more water later on.",
    "Add some food coloring into the water for an interesting effect!",
    "Fill the smaller can with enough rocks until the rim is level with the larger can's rim.",
    "Do not let your small can sink all the way to the bottom; you want both rims to be level with each other, and about a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) of space between the two cans at the bottom.",
    "The water level will rise as the smaller can sinks into the water.",
    "Make sure that the water is \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the larger can's rim.",
    "If there is too much water, pump some of it out with a baster.",
    "If you can't find any rocks, you can use other items from your kitchen or garden, such as pebbles, rice, dried beans, marbles, etc.",
    "Tape the rims of the cans together so that the smaller can stays in the center.",
    "Cut four equal-sized pieces of tape, and stick them to the top, bottom, and sides of the small can's rim.",
    "Carefully fold the pieces of tape over onto the larger can's rim.",
    "This will help the small can float in the center, and ensure that your luminary will be the same thickness all around.",
    "Consider adding some greenery.",
    "At this point, your candle is just about ready for freezing.",
    "You can make it more festive, however, by filling it with bright items from your kitchen or garden.",
    "Here are some ideas:\nFor a spring luminary: bright green leaves, pieces of fern, and/or spring flowers (ie: Johnny-Jump-Ups)\nFor a fall luminary: brightly-colored leaves, orange slices, and or spices (ie: cinnamon sticks or star anise)\nFor a winter luminary: sprigs of pine, tiny pinecones, twigs, and/or holly berries.",
    "For a summer luminary: leafy herbs (ie: basil or mint), citrus slices (ie: lime or lemon), and/or brightly-colored flowers.",
    "Check the water level, then pour or add more water if needed.",
    "As you add more items into the water, the water level will rise.",
    "You want it to be \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the rim of the large can.",
    "The water will expand as it freezes, and if the water level is too high, it will over flow.",
    "If you have too much water, pump it out using a baster.",
    "This way, you won't risk messing up your added greenery.",
    "If you don't have enough water, carefully pour it in a thin stream into the space between the two cans.",
    "Freeze the water.",
    "If it is below freezing outside, simply leave your can outside overnight.",
    "If it is above freezing, stick the can into your freezer overnight.",
    "Remember, the larger your container is, the longer it will take to freeze.",
    "Take the ice luminary out of the mold.",
    "Run lukewarm or cool water over the outside and inside of your luminary until you can move the cans around.",
    "Peel the tape away, then slide the luminary out of the large can.",
    "Carefully pull the smaller can out.",
    "Do not use hot water, as this may cause the ice to crack.",
    "Use the luminary with flameless candles.",
    "You can use these luminaries right-side-up or upside-down.",
    "Because they are made out of ice, they do not last forever.",
    "If you cannot find any flameless candles, you can use real tea lights instead, but keep in mind that the flame will cause the ice to melt faster.",
    "The melting ice may also extinguish the candle.",
    "If you want a centerpiece for your table, place the luminary with the hole facing up.",
    "Stick a flameless candle into the hole.",
    "If you want to light your pathway, place a flameless candle down on the ground, then place the luminary over it, flat side up."
