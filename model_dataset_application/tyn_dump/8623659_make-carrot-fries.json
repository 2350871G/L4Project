Place a deep frying temperature in the pan, and heat the oil over medium heat until the temperature reaches 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). If you don\u2019t have a deep frying temperature, a candy thermometer will also work to monitor the oil\u2019s temperature. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer that can withstand high temperatures, toss a small cube of bread into the oil. The oil is hot enough if the bread browns in 3 minutes. Be careful around the hot oil. It can bubble and splatter if it gets too hot."
