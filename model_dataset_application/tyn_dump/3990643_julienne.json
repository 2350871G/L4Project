Clean the knife and cutting board with hot water and soap, and be sure to rinse both off thoroughly.

A chopping knife works well but is not required. It's important to only use a sharp knife so you can make clean cuts. Peel the vegetable if you want to. Potatoes and carrots are often peeled before being julienned. It is up to you depending on how you plan to eat them. If you don't peel your potatoes, at least make sure buds or eyes are removed from the skin. Use a peeler or a paring knife to remove the skin. Cut rounded vegetables into a rectangle.

Cutting Onions with a Knife Remove the top and tail portions. The stem and tail pieces aren't needed for juliennes, so cut them off and throw them away. You can also peel off the outer skin layers of the onion so that you have just the flesh left. Onions tend to be a little firmer than many other vegetables, so make sure your knife is sharp before you start. A dull knife will make the process much harder. Make sure the top and bottom are chopped off in a nice smooth cut. Cut the onion in half. Since onions are generally about the size that you want julienne sticks to be lengthwise, there is no need to cut an onion into a rectangle or into chucks. Simply cut it in half from top to bottom. Slice diagonally toward the center of the onion. With the onion laying flat side down, slice at an angle so that pieces stay at a uniform thickness. As you near the halfway point, your knife should be at 90 degrees. Flip the onion on its side and continue cutting. Perform the same process with the second half of the onion. Using a Mandoline Slicer Set up the mandoline on a sturdy surface. Some mandolines have a container to catch the food as it is sliced, but if not, make sure you have a container under it. Set the mandoline on your cutting board, or on the counter or table, and be sure it will not slide around as you slice. Choose your blade and set the thickness. Different models will have different options. If yours has multiple blades, then pick which is best for what you are cutting.
