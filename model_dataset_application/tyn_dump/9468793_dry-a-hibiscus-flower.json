    "Try again the next day.",
    "Cut the seed pod away from the calyx.",
    "Cut the calyx from the stem of the flower first.",
    "Next, cut a shallow slit down the length of the calyx.",
    "Pry open the calyx with your fingers, then pop the seed pod out.",
    "Try to keep the calyx intact.",
    "Don't throw the seed pods away!",
    "Allow the seed pods to dry for 1 week, then crack them open and plant the seeds.",
    "Dry the calyx using a dehydrator.",
    "Preheat the dehydrator between 95 to 115 \u00b0F (35 to 46 \u00b0C).",
    "Spread the calyxes on the tray in a single layer.",
    "Allow the calyxes to dry completely before taking them out of the dehydrator.",
    "This will take about 1 to 4 hours.",
    "Each dehydrator is different, so follow the instructions on your model carefully.",
    "Use the calyx to brew hibiscus tea.",
    "Pour 2 cups (475 milliliters) of hot water over 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of dried hibiscus calyxes.",
    "Allow the tea to steep for 10 minutes before removing the calyxes.",
    "Flavor the tea as desired with lemon juice, sugar, or honey.",
    "Serve the tea hot or iced.",
    "If you want a stronger tea, use more hibiscus calyxes and increase the brewing time.",
    "Use the calyx to make potpourri.",
    "If hibiscus tea isn't for you, you can add the dehydrated calyx to homemade potpourri.",
    "You can try using it in homemade candles or soap as well, but it would be a good idea to crumble it up first so that it isn't as bulky.",
    "Alternatively, you can string whole calyxes onto thread and make a pretty garland for your room."
