Here are a few examples of the product instructions:\nMix 1 oz. of product per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. This is a mix ratio. Using stronger concentrations does not make the product more effective, but can increase its toxicity. Do not use in windy conditions. Windy conditions may cause the product to drift into unprotected areas, or into a waterway where contamination and unintentional aquatic life kill is possible. Do not mix with other products. Mixing pesticides, or any chemical, may produce unexpected and dangerous results."

      "description":"The warning label contains specific information about the product. Some obvious information may include the following. Its toxicity level. \"CAUTION\" means that it is mildly toxic. Lethal dose is an ounce or more. \"WARNING\" means that it is moderately toxic. Lethal dose is between a teaspoon and tablespoon,\n\"DANGER\" means that it is highly toxic. Lethal dose is trace amounts. Avoid fumes, use in well ventilated area. Liquid pesticides may produce poisonous fumes when the container is opened, or while the product is being mixed and applied. Avoid contact with skin. Many chemical products may be absorbed through skin. Avoid sparks or open flame. Pesticides are often suspensions in petroleum distillate solvents, which can be highly flammable."

      "description":"Never use food preparation utensils for this purpose. Even if you only intend to use a measuring cup for your pesticide, it could accidentally be picked up and taken into the kitchen later. Mix your pesticide in the application equipment if possible, to avoid handling it during use. Commonly, compressed air or pump up garden sprayers are used for this purpose. In agriculture, tractor mounted, PTO driven equipment is used to apply pesticides on crops and farm land."

Measure the area you intend to treat, and calculate the amount of material required to treat it. Storing left over mixed pesticides is generally not a good idea, but if you must, label the container according to contents and date mixed, and keep it tightly closed."

Rubber, neoprene, or other chemical resistant gloves protect your hands from chemicals which may be absorbed through your skin. Long sleeved shirts and long pants. Another barrier protection for your skin. When the application process is complete, remove clothing and rinse it thoroughly before laundering. Rubber boots.
