Make sure your hands are a few inches apart on the axe handle before you start chopping. Grab the axe by placing your non-dominant hand 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) above the end of the axe handle. Position your other hand approximately 25% down the handle below the blade of the axe. If you are right-handed, your right hand should be the one closest to the blade.
