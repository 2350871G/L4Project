You have to open the key, although in some fobs the key is removable. Either slide the key out or spring it away from the fob. A fob with a sliding key has a small button on the top. Hold the button down while pulling on the key to remove it. For a fob with a springing key, press the spring button on the fob or pull the key forward to get it out of the way."

Rotate the screw counterclockwise to remove it. Work slowly to avoid stripping the screw. Set the screw aside in a safe spot, such as inside a resealable bag or small cup, to avoid losing it."
