Cut a length of string about 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) long, depending on how low you want the flower to hang from the ceiling. Use hot glue or painter's tape to secure the string to the top of the flower's back. If you use glue, let it dry before hanging your flower up. Try choosing a string or ribbon color that matches your flower's color scheme. If your flower is pink and yellow, for example, use a yellow ribbon to make its color pop."

Pinning Paper Flowers to Fabric Purchase self-adhesive bar pins from a craft store. Self-adhesive bar pins are ideal for hanging paper flowers to fabrics without damaging them. Buy bar pins online or from the jewelry section of a nearby craft store. If you cannot find adhesive bar pins, you can use hot glue to secure non-adhesive bar pins in place. Press the bar pin's backing against the paper flower. Turn the flower upside down and place it on a table or other flat surface. Take off the bar pin's backing and attach it to the center of the paper flower's back. Add hot glue to its backing for a stronger hold or if you purchased non-adhesive bar pins. Let the paper flower dry for 30-60 minutes before using it as a decoration. If you used hot glue on the bar pin's backing, let it dry for up to an hour. The bar pin may fall off if you try to hang the paper flower before the hot glue has dried. Open the bar pin and attach it to the fabric object. Press down on one end of the bar pin and move the needle to the side to open it. Stick the needle through the fabric, then move the needle back to the side to secure its hold. If pinning multiple flowers to the fabric, space them out evenly for an organized look.",
