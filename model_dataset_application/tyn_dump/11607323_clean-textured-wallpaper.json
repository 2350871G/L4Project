If the microfiber cloth gets dirty while you\u2019re cleaning, replace it with a fresh one so you don\u2019t spread the dust around. You do not need to use any dusting spray or cleaning solutions when you dust your wallpaper. If you can\u2019t reach the top of your wallpaper, use a step ladder or a long-handled duster. Dust your wallpaper once every 2 months so it stays maintained and dust-free."

Dry-cleaning sponges work great for getting rid of soot, mold, and other stuck-on residues. Dry-cleaning sponges are not the same as magic eraser sponges. Avoid using magic erasers since they contain small abrasives that could damage the wallpaper."
