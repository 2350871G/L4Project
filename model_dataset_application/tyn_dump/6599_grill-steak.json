    "If the steak is pink when you turn it then the grill is not hot enough -- raise the heat and leave it flipped over.",
    "Rare: grilled for roughly 3 minutes a side (raise the heat 25-50 degrees before beginning)\n\nMedium rare: grilled for roughly 5 minutes a side.",
    "Medium steaks: grilled for roughly 7 minutes a side.",
    "Well done steaks: grilled for 10 minutes each side, then removed to indirect heat to finish cooking.",
    "Learn the \"palm test\" to check your steaks internal temperature without cutting into it.",
    "You shouldn't cut a steak until 4-5 minutes after it comes off the heat, as the juices inside re-absorb in the meat as it cools, leading to a juicier cut.",
    "So how do you test the insides?",
    "The trick is literally in the palm of your hand.",
    "Hold your hand open, then touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your index finger.",
    "With your other hand, touch the fleshy part of your palm under your thumb -- this feels just like a medium rare steak.",
    "Each finger combination mimics a certain cook temperature:\n\nRare: Don't touch any fingers -- it feels just like the fleshy part under your thumb.",
    "(Internal Temp: 130-135\u00b0F)\n\nMedium Rare: Touch your index finger to your thumb.",
    "(Internal Temp: 130-135\u00b0F)\n\nMedium: Touch your middle finger to your thumb.",
    "(Internal Temp: 140\u00b0F)\n\nMedium Well: Touch your ring finger to your thumb.",
    "(Internal Temp: 155\u00b0F)\n\nWell Done: Touch your pinky to your thumb.",
    "(Internal Temp: 165\u00b0F\u00b0) Let the steaks finish cooking on indirect heat if the outside is done but the center needs some time.",
    "Move the steaks away from the flame, burner, or hot coals.",
    "If you have a higher rack on your grill, place the meat up here.",
    "Cover the grill and let the heat slowly cook the steak without allowing the outsides to burn.",
    "You shouldn't have to leave the steak for more than 1-2 more minutes unless you want it well done.",
    "Be sure to flip the steak halfway through cooking, even when cooking indirectly.",
    "Let the steak sit for at least 5-10 minutes before serving.",
    "This is called letting the meat \"stand.\"",
    "As it cooks, steak releases juices that keep it tender and delicious.",
    "As it cools, the meat reabsorbs these juices.",
    "However, if you cut the meat right after it comes off the grill the juices will spill out, lost forever.",
    "Instead, cover lightly with aluminum foil and let the beef sit.",
    "When you do cut the steak, try to cut with the grain.",
    "This means along with the small, strands of meat you can see running up and down the steak.",
    "You may also wish to familiarize yourself with the best way to carve your specific cut of beef.",
    "For example, there may be subtle differences in how you'd cut tri-tip versus T-bone steaks.",
    "Adding New Flavors Use a dry rub or seasoning instead of straight salt and pepper.",
    "You can purchase many of these rubs are sold pre-mixed right out the store, allowing you to mix new flavors into your meats.",
    "However, you can also make your own easily, starting with salt and pepper before adding 1/8 teaspoon of each ingredient from the following lists:\nDried thyme, oregano, rosemary, and garlic powder\nOnion powder, chili powder, paprika, and garlic powder\nChili powder, cayenne, Mexican oregano, paprika, garlic powder/salt\nBrown sugar, paprika, chili pepper, garlic, and ground coffee.",
    "Try out a wet marinade for a softer, more-flavorful steak.",
    "You'll need to get this started the night before, but all it requires is mixing the steaks with the following ingredients in a freezer bag and refrigerating overnight (at the very most).",
    "The acidic ingredients in each marinade will break down some of the meat proteins for a more tender cut.",
    "1/3 cups of soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce.",
    "Then add 1\u20132 tablespoons (14.8\u201329.6 ml) garlic powder, dried basil, parsley, rosemary, and crushed black pepper.",
    "1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) Worcestershire, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard.",
    "Then add 2-3 cloves minced garlic and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) ground black pepper.",
    "Slather your steak with a pat of butter for a rich steakhouse meal.",
    "Rich golden butter will seep into the meat to help keep it juicy, tender, and flavorful.",
    "For an even better finish, try to make a simple compound butter by mixing 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of room-temperature butter with one of the following ingredients.",
    "Then, before serving, re-chill the butter in the fridge so that it is hard.",
    "1 teaspoon fresh thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, chopped.",
    "2-3 cloves of minced garlic or 1 teaspoon garlic powder.",
    "1 teaspoon chili powder, cayenne pepper, cilantro, and/or lime juice Top your steak with something special to make a meal of it.",
    "The right topping can take your steak to the next level, adding a bit of crunch, a savory compliment, or a little bit of sharp, pungent flavor to balance the buttery delicious meat.",
    "Try out:\nOnions\nPeppers\nMushroom\nCrispy fried onions\nBleu cheese\nFresh parsley\nDollop of sour cream\n\nA quick pan sauce."
