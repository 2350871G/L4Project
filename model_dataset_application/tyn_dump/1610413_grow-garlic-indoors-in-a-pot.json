Choose containers that are deep enough and wide enough to fit all of the cloves you want to plant. Whether you choose to use a flower pot, a wooden crate, or any other type of container to grow your garlic indoors, it needs to be deep enough to allow the roots of the garlic to grow. To plant 3 cloves of garlic, make sure the container is at least 12 inches (30 cm) wide so you can space them out far enough to allow them to grow. Look for containers at garden supply stores, home improvement stores, and online. You can also check out your local craft supply stores to find interesting planting containers.Tip: You can use almost any container to plant your garlic.
