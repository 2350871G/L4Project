Make sure you put the spots for the curtain brackets at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the edge of the window on either side. Put the curtain bracket markings at least 4 inches (10 cm) from the top of the window, as this will ensure they hang properly and make the windows look long. Use a red pen to mark the spots for the curtain rod brackets so you do not confuse them with the markings for the valance brackets. Check that the valance brackets are double the length of the curtain rod brackets. So if your curtain rod brackets are 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, make sure you use valance brackets that are 4 inches (10 cm) long."

Putting up the Valance Hang the curtains. Thread the curtain onto the rod and then hang the rod in the brackets. Adjust the curtain so it is distributed evenly across the rod. Put up the curtains first so they can hang behind the valance. Slide the valance onto its rod. Hold the valance in one hand and slide the rod through it. The valance should hang flat off the rod.
