Place a good amount of pressure on the sandpaper and then rub it back and forth in a vertical motion over the vinyl. Work your way across the whole floor until all the vinyl looks dull and lacklustre. If your sandpaper loses its roughness, use a new piece. Use a dust mask when you are sanding if you are sensitive to dust particles."

This helps to ensure that your paint job looks smooth. Microfibre cloths work particularly well for this job. If you notice the cloth smearing dust across the vinyl, simply rinse it in water and then continue dusting the surface."

Use a paint roller with an extendable handle to apply the liquid deglosser to the floor to make it easier to roll on the paint. Start at the opposite corner to the entrance and then work your way back toward the door. This ensures that you don\u2019t get trapped in a corner of the room. Apply the liquid deglosser with long, even strokes to create a smooth finish. Purchase liquid deglosser from the paint section of a hardware or paint store."

Use the same rolling technique that you used when applying the liquid deglosser to ensure that you don\u2019t get trapped in a corner of the room.

If you find the smell of the primer strong or unpleasant, open the windows to increase the airflow in the room. If you live in a hot, dry climate, the primer may dry a little faster. Tap the floor with your finger to check if it is dry. If the surface still feels sticky, this shows that it still needs to harden and requires a little more drying time."

Stir the paint with a mixing stick for a few minutes and then dunk the extendable roller into the paint. Roll the paint onto the floor with long, even strokes to make the surface look flawless and professional. Avoid using chalk paint, as this isn\u2019t long-wearing and will quickly get marked from people walking on it.
