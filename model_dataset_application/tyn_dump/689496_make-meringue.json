          "description":"Meringue is made by beating air into egg whites, causing them to gain volume and become light and fluffy. The texture of meringue is best when the air is dry, because the presence of water can weigh it down. On rainy or humid days, the air contains higher water content. That's why meringue is easier to make and gains the right volume and texture when you make it on a dry day, rather than a rainy one. On rainy days, try beating the meringue longer so it's less likely to collapse."

Use clean, dry stainless steel or glass bowls and utensils to make meringue. Even a drop or two of water can ruin a meringue, so make extra sure the bowl is dry."

If you get your eggs from the supermarket, chances are they're already a few days old by the time you buy them, so they're probably fine. If you shop at the farmer's market, ask after the eggs' age so you know when to use them."

          "description":"You can use an egg separator or do it by hand. Meringue doesn't require egg yolks, so set those aside and use them to  custard or ice cream. The quickest way to separate eggs is to do the following:\nHold an egg over a clean stainless steel or glass bowl. Crack the egg on the rim of the bowl, letting the white fall into the bowl. Carefully separate the egg halves and pass the yolk from half to half, letting the white drop down. Continue until the white is in the bowl and all you have left is the yolk. If you still need practice with this technique, separate each egg into a small container and pour the white into the larger mixing bowl you're using. That way you won't ruin a whole batch of egg whites by accidentally dropping in the yolk of the last egg you crack."

Keep adding the sugar until you've used as much as you want, and keep beating until it's dissolved. Most meringue recipes call for 1/4 cup of sugar for every egg white. If you want a softer meringue, add less sugar. You can add as little as 2 tablespoons per egg white. For a stiffer meringue, add more sugar. It will give the meringue structure and gloss."
