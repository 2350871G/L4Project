          "description":"Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of milk into a saucepan, then heat it slowly on medium-low. Continue warming the milk until it begins to simmer, or when small bubbles slowly begin breaking the surface of the milk.It's best to use a heavy-bottomed saucepan to avoid scorching the milk. However, since you're warming the milk at a low heat, you can use a lightweight saucepan if that's all you have on hand. You can also use an unsweetened milk substitute, such as coconut, soy, almond, or cashew milk, if you prefer."

Then, whisk the mixture thoroughly to ensure all the spices are blended evenly.Ashwagandha is an adaptogen, which are herbs that are believed to help your body process and relieve stress. You can purchase the powdered root at health food shops, online, and even some well-stocked big box stores."

          "headline":"Cook the milk over low heat for 5-10 minutes.",
          "description":"Turn down the heat on your stovetop to low. Then, allow the milk to keep simmering for about 5-10 minutes. The longer you simmer the milk, the stronger the flavors will be, but you don't want to simmer the milk for too long or it could scorch.This will allow the flavors from the spices to steep throughout the milk, giving your moon milk a more robust flavor. In a Hurry? Mix the milk and spices in a microwave-safe container, then heat on medium-high in 15-second intervals, stirring the milk each time you heat it. When the milk starts to steam, it's ready."

Then, stir in 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of honey to sweeten the moon milk.To get the most health benefits from honey, it's best not to heat it, since heat may destroy honey's natural antibacterial properties."

This will help give the milk a light, frothy quality, similar to a latte. If you have a handheld milk frother, you can use that, instead. Keep in mind that some milk substitutes will not froth well."

A single cup could have you feeling relaxed enough to head to bed in no time!The benefits of moon milk come from the combination of the soothing spices, calming ashwagandha, and the natural sleep-inducers trytophan and melatonin, which are both found in milk. Moon milk is always served warm\u2014it's thought that this contributes to the relaxing effect. It's best to drink it right away so the milk doesn't spoil."
