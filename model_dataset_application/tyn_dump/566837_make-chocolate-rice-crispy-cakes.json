    "Don't let them cool completely, however, or you'll run into the chances of them sticking.",
    "If you used spring-form pans, you can simply open up the pans and take the cakes out.",
    "If you used basic pans, run a knife along the inner edges of the pan, then invert the cakes onto a plate.",
    "Combine the rice crispy cereal and melted chocolate.",
    "Melt the chocolate first, either in the microwave or over a double boiler, then fold in the rice crispy cereal using a rubber spatula.",
    "Keep mixing until the cereal is evenly coated with the melted chocolate.",
    "Pour the rice crispy mixture into a greased pan, and let it chill in the freezer for 20 minutes.",
    "You can do this in two, 9-inch (22.86 centimeters) cake pans, or you can do it in a square or rectangular baking pan.",
    "If you use the round cake pans, the rice crispy cakes will match your sponge cakes perfectly.",
    "If you choose to use a large pastry pan, you will need to chop it into smaller pieces in order to get it to fit on the round sponge cakes.",
    "If you are using two cake pans, consider setting some of the rice crispy mixture aside on some wax paper, and then chopping it up.",
    "You can use it as a garnish later on.",
    "Take the rice crispies out of the pans once they are set.",
    "If you used the round pans, simply dump them out, and set them aside on wax paper.",
    "If you used a square or rectangular pan, dump the rice crispy out, then chop it up with a knife.",
    "If you set some rice crispy mixture aside for the garnish, be sure to chop it up as well.",
    "Prepare the frosting.",
    "In an electric mixer, combine the butter, melted chocolate, icing sugar, and milk.",
    "Start on a low speed, then gradually increase to a medium speed setting until the frosting turns light and fluffy.",
    "If the frosting is too dry, add more milk.",
    "If the frosting is too wet, add more sugar.",
    "Beat the frosting well after each addition.",
    "Assemble the layers.",
    "Place the first cake down on a plate, and spread \u00be cup (45 grams) of frosting on top using an off-set cake decorating spatula.",
    "Top it off with the chocolate rice crispy.",
    "Repeat the cake, frosting, and rice crispy layer.",
    "Finish off with a final cake layer.",
    "If you chopped the rice crispy into chunks, you will need 1 cup (225 grams) per layer.",
    "Trim the tops off of the cakes to make them flat, if desire.",
    "Save the excess cake to make cake pops, or eat them.",
    "Frost the sides and top of the cake an off-set cake decorating spatula.",
    "When you get to doing the sides, consider spreading just a thin layer first, letting the cake sit in the freezer for about 15 minutes, and then spreading on the rest of the frosting.",
    "This thin, \"frozen\" layer is known as the \"crumb coat,\" and will help keep any loose crumbs in place.",
    "If you have any leftover rice crispy mixture, use it to garnish your cake.",
    "Finished."
