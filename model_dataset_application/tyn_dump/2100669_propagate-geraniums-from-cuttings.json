You may see roots appearing within three days for some varieties, longer for others and longer if the air is cool. New top growth will appear once the roots form and if you tug the cutting gently, it will stay in place (thanks to its new roots). If you planted several cuttings to a pot, transfer to individual containers once they have developed roots. Rooting should start between a week to a month after taking the cuttings."
