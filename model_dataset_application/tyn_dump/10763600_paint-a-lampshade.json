You could also cover everything with tape instead of using plastic bags, but it is easier to just cover the whole area with plastic, and then seal the edges to avoid getting spray paint on parts that you don\u2019t want to paint. You can tape designs onto the lampshade if you want to create a pattern instead of just a single shade all over. Try a zig-zag pattern, for example."

Put down old newspapers or regular paper in 2-3 layers to cover the area and protect it from spray paint. Work in a ventilated area when you use spray paint. A work area outside or near open doors and windows is the best option."

Add more paper around the sides if the lampshade is closer than 1 ft (0.30 m) to the edges of the covered work area. There is still a chance that the paint can drift outside of the covered area when you spray it, so it\u2019s best not to use nice furniture like a dining room table as your work surface, and avoid spraying near other objects you wouldn\u2019t want to get paint on."

Spray all over the lampshade until you have an even coat. Work in the same direction as you spray to apply the coat of paint evenly. For example, work top to bottom or left to right. Lighter colored spray paints work best so that the light can still shine through the shade. Acrylic spray paint works best to paint any type of lampshade."

Put it back on the base of the lamp, screw the lightbulb back in if you took it off, and turn the lamp on. Take it off and add another coat of paint if there are any uneven spots or if you are not happy with how it looks yet. If the shade looks splotchy, then you need to apply another coat of paint.

Put some acrylic, chalk, or fabric paint in a paint tray or plastic cup and use a small flat paintbrush to apply an even coat to the shade. Use long, straight up and down brush strokes to coat the lampshade evenly. Test the lampshade on the lamp once the paint is dry and apply more coats until you are happy with the finished look. Using chalk paint will give the finish an aged, chalky appearance. You can experiment by watering it down a bit to give the finish different looks. Acrylic paint will give your lampshade the most solid looking coat. Fabric paint is similar to acrylic paint, but it will have a less stiff-looking finish since it is designed specifically to soak into fabric easily."
