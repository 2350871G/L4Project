          "headline":"Make a basic facial mask out of turmeric powder, almond oil, milk, and flour.",
          "description":"Use a small bowl or plastic container to stir together 2 tbsp (28 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 tsp (4.2 g) of turmeric powder, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of almond oil, and 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of milk. Blend it with a spoon or fork until it's creamy like a cake batter. If the mixture has large clumps or if it\u2019s the consistency of cookie dough, add more milk 1 tablespoon (15 mL) at a time. If you live a plant-based lifestyle, use nut milk instead of cow's milk. Nut-based milk varieties don't have skin-firming lactic acid, but they will nourish your skin with moisture. Store any leftover paste in a sealed plastic container and in the fridge for up to 1 week. If you want to use it again after 4 days of storage, smell the mask first to make sure it's still good. If it smells sour, make a new batch."

          "headline":"Use an egg white, turmeric, and vitamin E mask to reduce wrinkles.",
          "description":"Crack 1 egg into a small bowl, carefully separating the whites from the yolk and discard the yolk when you're done. Froth it with a fork for about 30 seconds. Use a push-pin or the tip of a knife to puncture a vitamin E capsule and stir it into the egg white. Spoon 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) of turmeric powder into the mixture and blend it with a fork for about 1 minute until it's light and foamy. It's best to wash this mask off with cold water. Egg whites can stimulate the production of collagen in your skin, which can make fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable."

          "headline":"Even your skin tone with a mask of honey, turmeric, and tea tree oil.",
          "description":"In a small bowl, spoon out 3 tbsp (84 grams) of turmeric powder and then add 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of honey. Pour in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar and the juice of 1/3 of a small lemon, which is about \u20443 tablespoon (4.9 mL). Finish it off with 3 drops of tea tree oil and mix it together until it's the consistency of loose cake batter. Raw honey won't work because it's too thick. It may help to heat the jar of honey in the microwave, just make sure the jar is made of glass and free of metal parts. If you only have honey in a plastic tub, dole out the amount you need into a microwavable bowl and heat it for 5 seconds."

Blend the mixture with a spoon for about 50 strokes until it has the consistency of thick cookie dough. Be sure to work the mask onto your skin in small, gentle circles starting from your chin and moving upward to your cheeks and forehead.

Mix it up with a spoon for about 50 strokes or until most or all of the powder has been incorporated. If you have lots of dry turmeric powder after mixing it for 50 strokes, add more pineapple juice \u20442 tablespoon (7.4 mL) at a time. The paste will be very thick and flake off, so apply it while you lean over a sink or other washable non-porous surface. Pineapple juice is loaded with vitamin C and antioxidants which help minimize fine lines and puffiness."

If you\u2019re wearing heavy makeup and your cleanser doesn\u2019t remove makeup, use a makeup-removing wipe to take it off and then wash your face with the cleanser. Avoid using a cleanser that contains sulfates because these can throw off the pH of your skin, which may cause dryness, irritation, and redness.

If the towel is visibly steaming after being in the microwave, air it out for 20 to 30 seconds so you don\u2019t burn your skin.

Avoid your eyebrows and hairline because turmeric can remove hair or inhibit hair growth. Be sure to slather it on your under-eye area to get rid of dark circles.

Start at your chin and work your way up your face so the moistened mask won\u2019t drip into your eyes while you're trying to wipe it off. You may want to wear a new set of disposable gloves for this part so your hands or fingernails won't turn yellow. If you don\u2019t have gloves, use a clean rag to wipe it off (one that you don\u2019t care about staining). Wipe off any splatters that get onto your countertops, floor, or other nearby surfaces.

If you still see some yellow after washing your face, feel free to use a gentle exfoliant (like a cleanser with small micro-beads)\u2014just be extra gentle when you rub it on!
