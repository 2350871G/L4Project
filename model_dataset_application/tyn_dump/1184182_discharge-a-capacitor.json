          "description":"If the capacitor isn\u2019t already removed from whatever you\u2019re working on, ensure you\u2019ve disconnected any power source leading to it. This usually means unplugging the electronic device from the wall outlet or disconnecting the battery in your car. In a car, locate your battery in the engine bay or trunk, then loosen the nuts holding the cables on the negative (-) and positive (+) terminals using an open-ended wrench or socket with a ratchet. Slide the cable off of the terminal to disconnect it. Wrap the end of each cable with a rag so they don\u2019t touch anything. In your house, you can usually unplug the device you\u2019re working on from the wall, but if you are unable to do so, locate the house\u2019s breaker box and flip the switch that controls the flow of electricity to the room you\u2019re working in."

Hold the leads on the posts while you read the display on the multimeter. You may need to open your appliance or remove components to gain access to the capacitor. Refer to an application specific repair manual for help if you can\u2019t locate or access the capacitor. Touching both leads to the same post will not produce an accurate reading.

Generally speaking, a charge of greater than 10 volts is considered dangerous enough to shock you. If the capacitor reads as having fewer than 10 volts, you don\u2019t need to discharge it. If the capacitor reads anywhere between 10 and 99 volts, discharge it with a screwdriver.

    "Then do the same with the other loose end on the other wire.",
    "If you are going to use heat shrink wrap, remember to slide it over the wire before soldering the clip into place; otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to get it over the head of the clip once it\u2019s permanently affixed to the wire.",
    "Connect one alligator clip to each of the two posts on the capacitor to discharge it.",
    "Clip the end of each wire to a different terminal on the capacitor.",
    "It will discharge very quickly, though you shouldn\u2019t see or hear a spark as you would with a screwdriver.",
    "Be sure each clip has a clean connection with the metal of the post.",
    "Be careful not to touch the posts with your hands while you connect them.",
    "Use a multimeter to make sure the capacitor has discharged.",
    "Once again set the multimeter to its highest voltage rating and touch each lead to a separate post on the capacitor.",
    "If it still shows stored voltage, check the connections on your discharge tool and try again.",
    "You can leave the multimeter connected to the capacitor while you watch the voltage drop in real time.",
    "If the voltage doesn\u2019t drop, one of the connections isn\u2019t right in the discharge tool.",
    "Examine it closely for where one might be broken.",
    "Once all of the connections on the discharge tool are good, try again and it should discharge."
