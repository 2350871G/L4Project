If your bamboo is heartier, you may have to use a handsaw. Whatever tool you end up using, sterilize it first with household disinfectants, such as diluted bleach or rubbing alcohol. If you are using bleach to sterilize your tool, dilute it with water first. Use 1 part bleach for every 32 parts water.
