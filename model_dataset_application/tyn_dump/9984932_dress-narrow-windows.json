If you don't intend on shutting a window often, you can use curtains that are 1 and a half times the width instead. Hang the curtains 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) higher than the window's trim to make it look larger."

          "description":"Curtains can easily weigh down narrow windows, especially if they are made out of thick, bulky fabric. To avoid this, choose a valance instead. A valance is a small piece of fabric that hangs across the top of the window. They add softness, color, and pattern to your space without covering up too much of the window. These are purely decorative, so go with a longer curtain if you want to block out light. Valances look great in kitchens, bathrooms, and dining rooms, for example. Select a box-pleated valance if you want to add some interest. In addition, you can use a swag if you want a light, decorative touch. A swag is a fabric strip that is draped over a rod or tieback. The middle of the fabric acts as a valance, while the ends hang down on either side of the window. Valences can date the space, so choose a modern and fun material if you choose to make one."
