          "description":"Chairs are a great option because their backs provide a high fort ceiling. Position the rows in front of a sofa, bed, or wall if you want the fort to be enclosed on the back side. Space the rows of chairs about 4 to 6 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) apart depending on the size of your blanket. If you don\u2019t have chairs to support your fort, see what other sturdy items are in the room. Laundry hampers, ottomans, and boxes can serve as fort building materials. Place the items side-by-side if you need to use multiple pieces to create the fort. You can use furniture of different heights to create high and low places in the fort, which makes it extra fun to crawl around inside. Make sure to choose furniture items that are tall enough so you will be able to crawl or sit under the blankets in the fort.Tip: Your blanket fort will need to have enough room for you to crawl and play in, so choose an area with plenty of space and avoid blocking doorways. The living room, dining room, or bedroom are all good options."

Then, place several cushions or pillows around the edges of the fort. You can also place extra blankets or sleeping bags in the fort to cover yourself up. If the ceiling of your fort is high enough, you could even place a few low chairs or stools in the fort, such as bean bag chairs or ottomans."

Pull the blanket or sheet taut so that it is not drooping down in the center of the fort\u2019s ceiling. Layer more than 1 sheet or blanket over the furniture to provide a darker environment inside of the fort. Use a light-colored sheets to allow some light into the inside of the fort, or use a dark-colored sheet or blanket to make it darker in the fort."

Grab a few books or other heavy objects and place them on the edges of the blanket. Clothes pins may be enough to secure the edges of a sheet on some types of furniture. For example, if you are using a couch as part of your fort base, then clip the sheet edge to the fabric on the couch using a clothes pin. Propping large pillows or couch cushions against the fort\u2019s framework can also help to secure the blankets."
