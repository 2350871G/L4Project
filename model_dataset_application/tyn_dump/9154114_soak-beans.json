Sift through the beans by hand and pick out any foreign object you find. No amount of soaking will soften a rock! Since beans grow in the ground, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to contain small stones or other debris. Rocks will usually be easy to spot, as they\u2019re colorless and tend to be smaller than most kinds of beans."

A quick trip under the faucet will help wash away any traces of dirt that happen to be clinging to the bean. Continue rinsing the beans until the water runs clear. Some cooks may choose to skip this step since soaking the beans also serves to wash them, but a preliminary rinse will result in a cleaner bean."

Use cool or lukewarm water only, not cold. Unless you\u2019re preparing them in bulk, it will be easiest to soak all of your beans at once. Breaking them up into multiple batches can be quite time-consuming. Beans expand as they absorb moisture, so make sure you choose a container that\u2019s large enough to account for any changes in size."

          "description":"Cover the beans and let them sit for at least 8 hours. For extra soft beans, you can soak them for as long as 24 hours. The longer the soak, the more indigestible sugars will leach out of the beans. Softer types of beans like lentils and chickpeas may only need to spend a few hours in water, whereas hard-shelled varieties like black beans will benefit from a longer soak. If you\u2019re running out of countertop space, make room for the bowl or pot in the refrigerator."

Give the beans another quick rinse, then refill the pot with fresh water to begin cooking them. A traditional soak is useful for when you have plenty of time on your hands, or if you\u2019d rather take care of your prep work in advance and save time putting together the finished meal. Never use the same water to cook as you did to soak. This will just reintroduce the same dirt and starchy byproducts back into the beans."
