Otherwise, the milk will be sweetened from the vanilla on the sides of your mug and from the caramel that you'll drizzle on the finished drink. You'll steam more milk than you'll end up using. This allows you to create foam and easily steam the milk. You can also use soy, almond, or hemp milk although they may steam differently than milk."

Set the portafilter on a clean surface and tamp down on the grounds. Make sure you're applying even pressure so the espresso remains completely level. Aim for 20 to 30 pounds of pressure, or enough to pack the espresso compactly. Practice your dosing by dosing and checking the weight of the grounds on a digital scale.

It may help to use a thermometer and stop steaming when it reaches 140. The milk will continue to heat even after you've removed the steam wand. To create plenty of foam for the macchiato, allow the tip of the steam wand to gently tap the surface of the milk so that it sucks in air. Tap the pitcher once you're done to break any large air bubbles. Clean the steam wand with a clean wet cloth until no milk remains on the wand. Purge it by turning it briefly so that any liquid that was left in the wand is sprayed out."
