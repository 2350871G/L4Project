Carefully pour out the water when you\u2019re done. The kind of rice you need is short-grain Japanese sushi rice. It may be sold as \u201csushi rice\u201d or under a similar label. Some Italian medium-grain rices like arborio can be used as a substitute. If you have a strainer, you can use it to wash the rice. Put the rice in and stir it while the water flows over it."

Fold the plastic wrap in half, pressing down on each plum until the seeds come out. Chop up the plums and add them to the rice balls. If you live near an Asian market, you can buy umeboshi.

The seaweed strips are used to give you a way to pick up the onigiri without touching the sticky rice. You can make yours without seaweed if you don\u2019t mind this.

Creating an onigiri is traditionally done by hand, so you do not need to have any other tools. You can set the rice down on a cutting board or piece of plastic wrap. In fact, you can use plastic wrap to mold onigiri without touching it. Closing up the plastic wrap forces the onigiri into a ball. Another way to shape the onigiri is with an onigiri mold.

Fold the rice over on top of the filling, then finish rolling the rice into a ball shape. Keep firm pressure on the rice at all times. Using the proper amount of pressure is important. Squeezing too lightly or too hard causes the rice to fall apart. Some people find triangular onigiri to be easier to make. Hold the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of your free hand in an L-shape. After folding the ends of the rice mound over the filling, use your fingers to mold the onigiri into a triangle."

The nori holds the rice ball in its shape while keeping your hands rice-free when you eat. Larger strips of nori work particularly well with triangular onigiri. For instance, wrap the nori around the top sides of the triangle so the ends meet on the front surface. The nori forms a little coat. You do not have to use nori if you don\u2019t want it. You can also top your onigiri with extras, including more filling, roe, or sesame seeds."

Onigiri are meant to be portable snacks like sandwiches, so they can last a while, but the length of time depends on the filling you use. Salty fillings like umeboshi last the longest, even when left outside of the refrigerator. Onigiri with perishable ingredients like fish and mayonnaise spoil faster. You can also freeze the onigiri. Store them in a labeled freezer bag after wrapping them individually. They will last about 3 months and can be reheated in the microwave."

    "The easiest way is to use your free hand to lift up the sides of the rice mound.",
    "Fold the rice over on top of the filling, then finish rolling the rice into a ball shape.",
    "Keep firm pressure on the rice at all times.",
    "Using the proper amount of pressure is important.",
    "Squeezing too lightly or too hard causes the rice to fall apart.",
    "Some people find triangular onigiri to be easier to make.",
    "Hold the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of your free hand in an L-shape.",
    "After folding the ends of the rice mound over the filling, use your fingers to mold the onigiri into a triangle.",
    "Wrap the onigiri with a piece of seaweed.",
    "Finish your onigiri with the easiest topper ever.",
    "Take a single strip of nori and wrap it over the center of the rice.",
    "This works for both round and triangular onigiri.",
    "The nori holds the rice ball in its shape while keeping your hands rice-free when you eat.",
    "Larger strips of nori work particularly well with triangular onigiri.",
    "For instance, wrap the nori around the top sides of the triangle so the ends meet on the front surface.",
    "The nori forms a little coat.",
    "You do not have to use nori if you don\u2019t want it.",
    "You can also top your onigiri with extras, including more filling, roe, or sesame seeds.",
    "Store onigiri individually for up to 3 days.",
    "Cover each ball tightly in plastic wrap to preserve it.",
    "Store the nori separately in a resealable container.",
    "Onigiri are meant to be portable snacks like sandwiches, so they can last a while, but the length of time depends on the filling you use.",
    "Salty fillings like umeboshi last the longest, even when left outside of the refrigerator.",
    "Onigiri with perishable ingredients like fish and mayonnaise spoil faster.",
    "You can also freeze the onigiri.",
    "Store them in a labeled freezer bag after wrapping them individually.",
    "They will last about 3 months and can be reheated in the microwave."
