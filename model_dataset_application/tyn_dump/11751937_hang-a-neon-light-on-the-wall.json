Check the package that yours came in and find the included hardware so you know what you\u2019ll be working with. If you bought the light without clips, you can buy neon light clip sets from a hardware store or online. Check that the clips will fit on your lights before purchasing them. You'll also need screws or anchors to attach the clips to the wall. For lights that aren\u2019t attached to a pre-made backing, clips that hook around the lights are the most common hanging accessory. They might also come with plugs that have cut out slots that the lights sit in. Lights attached to a pre-made backing may have plugs that screw into the wall. You\u2019d then mount the frame over these plugs. Always check the instructions that come with your lights. Different products may have specific hanging procedures."

          "description":"Before attaching the lights, check the instructions that came with your light set and see if they tell you to place the clips in specific locations and follow those instructions. If not, then work along the light design and attach a clip every 6 in (15 cm). Gently press the clips onto the back of the lights until they snap into place. Adjust the clips so they'll sit flat against the wall. Be very careful when attaching the clips. The lights are thin and could break if you press down too hard. Some lights may already have the clips attached. If the lights came pre-mounted to a backboard, you don\u2019t have to attach any clips to the lights."

Use a level to confirm that the lights are straight. Make sure the lights are in a safe place where no one will bump into them. They can easily break. Behind bars and above couches or TVs are popular spots. Neon lights usually aren\u2019t heavy, so you don\u2019t need to find studs to hang them.
