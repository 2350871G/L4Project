Cut a piece of paper with a pair of scissors to make a 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) square. Fold the piece of paper in half and crease it along the edge. Cut off a \u20442 in \u00d7 \u20444 in (1.3 cm \u00d7 1.9 cm) rectangle from the corners on the folded edge.

Place a self-adhesive Velcro dot in the center of each long edge. Lay the piece of felt flat on your work surface so the long edges are on the left and right sides. Remove the backing paper from one of the Velcro dots and press it in the middle of the long edge on the left side of the felt.

Don\u2019t pull the cord too tight, or else you could break the wires inside and damage the earbuds. Fold the felt in half vertically to secure the Velcro dots together. Grab the left side of the felt and make a vertical fold so it lines up with the right edge. Push the Velcro dots together so they stay attached and hold the cord inside the holder. Put the holder in your pocket or a bag to transport them without getting tangled. Tie a ribbon or piece of twine around the outside of the felt if you\u2019re worried about the Velcro coming undone. Repurposing a Mint Container Peel the labels off of a circular plastic mint container. Look for a circular mint container that\u2019s made of plastic and has a hinged opening in the middle.

If the label or adhesive doesn\u2019t easily come off, spray an adhesive remover on the label and try wiping it off with a paper towel.

Position the first hole on the side of the mint container so it\u2019s \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) below where the lid opens. Keep your nondominant hand on top of the mint tin and slowly push the bit through the plastic. Place the second hole so it\u2019s \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) to the left or right from the first one. You don\u2019t need to drill holes in the side of the mint container if you don\u2019t want to add a key ring. The ring allows you to clip the container to a keychain or backpack so you don\u2019t lose it.Variation: Secure the mint container to your work surface with a C-clamp if it slides around or if you can\u2019t get a good grip on it. Feed a key ring through the drilled holes. Pull apart the key ring with your fingers so you can slide it onto the mint container. Feed the end of the ring through one of the holes you drilled and push the ring through it. Rotate the ring so the end exits through the second hole. Continue rotating the ring until it snaps closed to secure it to the mint container. The key ring allows you to clip the container to a backpack, bag, or keychain so you don\u2019t misplace it. Attach fabric to the top of the container with Mod Podge to customize it. Trace the top of the container onto a piece of fabric you want to use for your design. Cut the piece of fabric out with your scissors and line it up with the top of the mint container to ensure it fits. Apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to the top of the container and set the fabric on top of it. Press down on the fabric to secure it to the container. You don\u2019t have to put fabric on the container if you don\u2019t want to. Wrap your earbuds by hand into a circular coil. Straighten out the cord to make sure it doesn\u2019t have any tangles or snags. Grab the jack end of the cord with your nondominant hand and slowly wrap the cord around your fingers. Continue wrapping the cord so it has a circular shape and fits easily inside the mint container. Place the earbuds in the mint container and close the lid. Pop open the lid of the container and set your earbuds inside. Make sure the entire cord fits inside the container and doesn\u2019t stick out from the edge.
