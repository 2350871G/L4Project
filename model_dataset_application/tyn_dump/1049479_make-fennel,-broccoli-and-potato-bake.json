  "text":" Prepare your fennel by slicing off the green leafy sprouts and cut in half from the top down. It should now resemble a large onion cut in half. Slice these into thin wedges (head to tail, each cut on an angle going inwards to the centre) about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) thick. Peel & slice your potatoes into thin slices (approx 1/6th inch or just under half a centimetre).  Heat a saucepan of water large enough to hold the sliced vegetables (except the potato) until just boiling & heat a non stick pan with a little oil.  Fry the potato slices in the pan until a nice golden colour. They don't need to be fully cooked through, but browning the slices will give more flavour. Put aside when cooked on a plate lined with a paper towel. Blanch the broccoli florets about half a minute before removing with a slotted spoon. Aim to have them about half cooked through. Then add the fennel in the same boiling water for about 3 minutes. Drain the vegetables and put aside. This way the vegetables will cook quicker in the oven and cook more evenly. It is not essential to blanch the broccoli, but raw broccoli will add a different flavour to the dish and may be a little too undercooked when the rest of the ingredients are cooked through. Melt the butter in the other saucepan and add the flour (or gravy variation), stirring well to make a \"roux\".  Add the milk gradually stirring well until smooth and simmer for 2-3 minutes. It should be the consistency of pouring cream, if it's consistency is more liquid, cook a little longer, if too thick add a little more milk. Add salt and pepper to taste and the garlic to the sauce, stirring well.  Heat oven to 200C/392F  Layer in a baking dish layers of fennel, broccoli and fried potato, pouring the sauce in occasionally to ensure even distribution. Top with the remains of the sauce. If you cooked the sauce in a large pan, you may also add all vegetables into the sauce, stirring to cover then transferring to the baking dish.
