The size of your jar will determine how many glow sticks you will need to buy. The larger the jar is, the more glow sticks you will need. You will need two to three glow sticks, depending on the size of the jar. For example, a 16-ounce (473.18 milliliters) jar will need two to three 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) glow sticks. Consider purchasing a long-lasting glow stick. Most glow sticks only shine for only shine for 2 to 3 hours, while others will shine for 4 to 6 hours. Some glow sticks, however, will shine for up to 12 hours. The package will tell you how many hours the glow stick will shine for. The longer the glow stick shines, the longer you will be able to enjoy your fairy jar. Consider purchasing multiple colors of glow sticks. Most glow sticks come in basic colors, such as: red, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white. You can create new and exciting colors by combining existing ones.

If you are using spray paint, shake the can for a few moments until you can hear it rattle. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface and apply the paint in a light, even layer. Wait until the paint dries before applying a second layer. Make sure to spray paint in a well-ventilated area to avoid any light-headedness. Add glitter to the lid. For a more sparkly lid, brush on a layer of glue onto the top of the lid. Don't paint the sides with glue just yet. Pour some glitter onto the lid. Gently lift the lid off your work surface and tap the glitter off. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry before applying glue and glitter to the sides. Consider working over a sheet of paper. When you are done, fold the paper in half, and use it to funnel the excess glitter back into its container. Consider sealing the glitter so that it doesn't shed. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry, then apply a thin, even coat of clear, glossy spray paint. Wait for the coat to dry completely before applying a second one. Cover the lid with some fabric. Place the lid on top of some pretty fabric. Trace a circle around the lid\u2014make the circle about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) larger than the lid. Cut the circle out of the fabric and screw the lid onto the jar. Place the fabric circle on top of the lid and push the edges down around the sides of the lid. Wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the neck of the jar, holding the fabric in place. Tie the ribbon or twine into a pretty bow. Embellish the lid. Take a few colorful gemstones or rhinestones, and glue them onto the lid using hot glue or tacky glue. You can also glue beads, buttons, pretty rocks, or even a figurine to the top of the jar. Tie a ribbon around the neck of the jar. You can also decorate the ribbon by gluing a flower or rhinestone in the middle of the bow. Use a colored jar. Tinted mason jars come in different colors, including blue, green, and purple. They can help lend a more unique look to your fairy jar. If you cannot find a tinted mason jar, you can make your own by mixing a few drops of food coloring with a glossy decoupage glue. Paint the outside of the jar with the mixture using a paintbrush or a foam brush. You can also paint the jar with a matte decoupage glue or matte spray-on sealer. This will give the glass a frosted look, and will work best with the battery-operated string lights. Add fairy-shaped silhouettes. You can print out silhouettes of fairies and cut them out using a craft knife. Tape or glue the fairies to the outside of the jar.",

    " Making a Basic Fairy Jar Plan to make the project in the evening.",
    "This project will require glow sticks.",
    "Unfortunately, glow sticks only glow for a certain amount of time, so it would be best to do this project in the evening when it is already dark.",
    "This way, you will not be wasting any of your glow sticks' \"glow\" time.",
    "Find a suitable jar for the fairies.",
    "You can use any size jar you want, but keep in mind that the smaller the jar is, the more glow you will get.",
    "A larger jar will have a less intense glow, and may require more glow sticks.",
    "You can also use a bulb-shaped glass bottle with a cork stopper.",
    "Consider using a tinted mason jar.",
    "You can also tint the jar yourself by mixing a glossy decoupage glue with a few drops of food coloring, and then painting the jar with it.",
    "Purchase some glow sticks.",
    "Any sort of glow stick will work, but the 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) glow sticks will have better results than the bracelets or necklaces, which do not glow for very long.",
    "The size of your jar will determine how many glow sticks you will need to buy.",
    "The larger the jar is, the more glow sticks you will need.",
    "You will need two to three glow sticks, depending on the size of the jar.",
    "For example, a 16-ounce (473.18 milliliters) jar will need two to three 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) glow sticks.",
    "Consider purchasing a long-lasting glow stick.",
    "Most glow sticks only shine for only shine for 2 to 3 hours, while others will shine for 4 to 6 hours.",
    "Some glow sticks, however, will shine for up to 12 hours.",
    "The package will tell you how many hours the glow stick will shine for.",
    "The longer the glow stick shines, the longer you will be able to enjoy your fairy jar.",
    "Consider purchasing multiple colors of glow sticks.",
    "Most glow sticks come in basic colors, such as: red, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white.",
    "You can create new and exciting colors by combining existing ones.",
    "For example, if you mix blue and green together, you will get teal.",
    "Activate the glow stick.",
    "Hold the glow stick with two hands, and bend it in half until you hear a \"snap.\"",
    "This will shatter the glass tube inside the glow stick and release the chemicals that cause it to glow.",
    "Hold the glow stick over the jar and cut one of the ends off.",
    "You can use a craft knife or a pair of scissors.",
    "Glow sticks are non-toxic, but the chemicals can burn and irritate your skin.",
    "Protect yourself by wearing some rubber gloves for this step.",
    "Adult supervision is required for this step.",
    "Consider placing a small, tightly-woven strainer over the mouth of the jar.",
    "The strainer will catch any bits of glass that might fall out of the glow stick.",
    "Do not use this strainer for cooking or baking after this project.",
    "Pour the contents into the jar.",
    "Turn the glow stick upside down and pour the liquid into the jar.",
    "You may have to shake the tube a little bit to get all of the liquid out.",
    "If there are any large pieces of glass inside the jar, you can scoop them out using a plastic fork or spoon.",
    "Discard the fork or spoon after using it; do not use it again for eating.",
    "Sprinkle in some glitter.",
    "You can use any type of glitter you want, but iridescent glitter will give you the best results because it will allow the glow to shine through.",
    "How much glitter you use will depend on the size of your jar as well a your preferences.",
    "For example, for an extra glittery 16-ounce jar (473.18 milliliters), you will need \u00bc cup (32 grams) of super-fine glitter.",
    "Consider using shaped pieces of glitter, such as flowers, hearts, and stars.",
    "Consider mixing super-fine glitter and chunky crafting glitter in different colors for an interesting effect.",
    "Consider adding some filler.",
    "The glow stick fluid will cause the glitter to stick to the sides of the jar, but you can make the glitter appear as though it is suspended inside the jar by adding filler, such white tulle or organza.",
    "You can also use clear, iridescent cellophane.",
    "Simply cut a piece of your chosen filler, and scrunch it inside the jar.",
    "You want it to be big enough so that fits loosely into the jar, but not so big that it completely stuffs the jar.",
    "Close the jar tightly and shake it.",
    "Be sure the glow stick material and glitter coats the inside walls of the jar.",
    "Decorate the jar.",
    "You can make your jar extra special by painting the lid or even covering it with some glitter or pretty fabric.",
    "Read the section in this article on decorating your jar for more ideas.",
    "Take the jar into a dark room.",
    "The glow stick fluid will shine during daylight, but it will be even brighter and more effective in a dark room.",
    "Making a Reusable Fairy Jar Purchase some battery-operated LED string lights.",
    "The best lights for this project are the miniature LED string lights with a small battery pack.",
    "They are often used to decorate miniature villages and houses.",
    "You can also use ordinary-sized LED string lights, but make sure that they are battery operated and that the wire is not too long.",
    "Look for something with a silver or white-colored cable.",
    "You are using LED lights because they do not produce as much heat as regular lights.",
    "If you are planning on filling your jar with moss, then consider getting some lights with a green cable instead.",
    "Find a suitable jar for the fairies.",
    "You can use any sort of jar you want, but make sure that the battery pack to your lights can fit inside the mouth of the jar.",
    "Consider using a tinted jar.",
    "You can also make your own tinted jar by mixing a few drops of food coloring with a glossy decoupage glue and painting the jar with it.",
    "For a softer effect, paint the jar with a matte decoupage glue.",
    "This will soften the glow of the jar, so that you will see the lights, but not the wire.",
    "Attach the battery pack to the inside of the lid.",
    "Tape your battery pack to the bottom of the jar lid.",
    "The battery pack will go inside the jar, and won't be visible once you finish decorating it.",
    "Make sure that you can still reach the switch.",
    "You could try taping the battery pack, so it will be easier to take the pack out and change/charge the batteries.",
    "If the battery pack does not fit inside the jar or the lid, purchase a canning mason jar with a two-part lid.",
    "Get rid of the flat disk portion of the lid and keep the ring.",
    "Tape the battery pack to the top of the lid, and cover it with a piece of fabric.",
    "You will wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the fabric after you put the lid on the jar to secure the fabric.",
    "The string of lights will go through the hole in the lid and into the jar.",
    "Tuck the lights inside the jar.",
    "Spread them out so that they fill the entire jar.",
    "Consider adding some filler.",
    "By adding some filler, such as white tulle, organza, or clear, iridescent cellophane, you can diffuse the light and make it appear softer.",
    "The filler will also help conceal the wires.",
    "Simply cut a piece of filler that is slightly larger than your jar and tuck it inside.",
    "You want the filler to be large enough so that it can be scrunched up loosely in the jar, but not so large that you have to stuff it in tightly.",
    "You can also use some moss instead of tulle, organza, or cellophane.",
    "This will create a more forest-y effect.",
    "Turn the lights on and place the lid on the jar.",
    "Flick the switch on the battery pack into the \"on\" position and place the lid on top of the jar.",
    "Screw the lid on tightly.",
    "Decorate the jar.",
    "You may still see a bit of the battery pack.",
    "You can conceal it by wrapping a ribbon around the neck of the jar and tying it in a bow.",
    "For more decorating ideas, refer to the section in this article on decorating your fairy jar.",
    "Enjoy the jar in a dark room.",
    "The lights will still be visible during daylight, but they will be even brighter and more effective in a completely dark room (especially if you made the jar look frosted).",
    "Making a Rechargeable Fairy Jar[6]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Choose a clear jar.",
    "You can use any size jar, but make sure that the mouth is wide enough for you to be able to stick a paint brush into.",
    "You can use a glass jar or a plastic jar.",
    "A lid is not needed for this project.",
    "Whatever jar you decide to use, make sure that it is clear, as you will be painting the inside of it.",
    "Clean your jar.",
    "Wipe the inside and outside of your jar with some rubbing alcohol.",
    "Any oil or residue left on the jar will prevent the paint from sticking to it.",
    "Purchase some glow-in-the-dark paint.",
    "You can use fabric paint or acrylic paint, but make sure that the label says \"glow-in-the-dark.\"",
    "Unlike glow sticks, glow-in-the-dark paint can be reactivated once the glow fades.",
    "This means that you can use this jar again and again just by leaving it in the sunlight so that it can \"recharge.\"",
    "Select your painting tools.",
    "You will be making little dots and speckles inside the jar with the paint.",
    "You can use a thin paintbrush to do this, or a long wooden skewer.",
    "You can even use different sized brushes and wooden skewers to create different sized dots for a more interesting effect.",
    "Prepare your paint.",
    "Shake the bottle of paint to mix up the glow particles inside.",
    "Pour out about a teaspoon of paint onto a dish.",
    "Acrylic paint and fabric paint dry quickly, so you do not want to pour out too much paint at once, or it will dry before you finish using it.",
    "You can always pour more paint onto your dish if you run out.",
    "Make little dots inside the jar.",
    "Dip your paintbrush or skewer into the paint and start making little dots and speckles inside the jar.",
    "If you are using multiple colors, work with one color at a time.",
    "Let the paint dry before putting the lid back on.",
    "This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, but refer to the instructions on the paint bottle for more specific drying times.",
    "Consider drying your jar in the sun or under a bright light; this will allow the paint to \"charge.\"",
    "Activate the paint.",
    "Leave your jar in a brightly-lit room or in some sunlight for 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "Consider decorating the jar.",
    "You can paint the lid a different color, or over it with glitter or fabric.",
    "You can even place some filler, such as tulle, organza, or clear, iridescent cellophane inside the jar, For more decorating ideas, refer to the section on decorating your fairy jar.",
    "Use the jar.",
    "Once the paint has been activated, take your jar into a dark room.",
    "The paint will glow and look like little fairies.",
    "When the glow starts to fade, simply leave the jar in some like for a few minutes before taking it back into the room.",
    "Decorating Your Fairy Jar Add a filler.",
    "Adding items, such as tulle, organza, cellophane, stuffing, or even moss can help diffuse the light and make the jar look more magical.",
    "When choosing tulle or organza, go for a very soft, pale color, or white.",
    "When choosing cellophane, go for something iridescent, as it will reflect the light better.",
    "You can also use teddy bear stuffing and pieces of moss instead.",
    "Add a fairy inside the jar.",
    "Purchase a small fairy figurine, and glue her to the inside of the jar lid using hot glue or super glue.",
    "Screw the lid back onto the jar, and turn the jar upside down.",
    "The lid will now be the bottom of the jar, making it a sort of snow globe.",
    "Consider gluing gown bits of moss, stones, and tiny flowers to the lid around the fairy.",
    "This will hide the bottom of the lid, and give the fairy a pretty home to live in.",
    "If you cannot find a fairy figurine, you can make your own by purchasing a person-shaped figurine, and gluing craft butterfly wings to the back.",
    "Paint the lid.",
    "You can make your fairy jar more colorful by painting the lid.",
    "Lightly buff the lid with fine-grit sandpaper, and wipe it clean with a damp cloth to get rid of any dust.",
