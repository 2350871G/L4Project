          "description":"When you set up an account on Facebook.com, they will ask you to choose whether it is personal or if you are setting up an account for a business or organization. You must already have a personal page in order to set up a business Fan page. Fan pages are run by administrators who have personal accounts. When you create a Fan page, you will be added as an administrator, and you can appoint others to be administrators and post to the page as well. If you choose to combine your personal account with your eBay sales, it is a good idea to announce to your friends, family and acquaintances that you will be starting to showcase a few of your eBay sales online. You can ask them to please pass the item on to anyone who they think would like it. It is a good idea to only post sales occasionally, so that people do not get annoyed by constant posting and \"unfriend\" you. If you create a Facebook Fan page, the term for a business page, then you should create a brand and personality before you start posting eBay sales. Ask a graphic designer to design an attractive profile picture and Timeline cover that boost your image as a professional, reliable business. Also, post professional pictures of yourself and welcoming information in your information and on your wall. In general, social media users do not like a \"hard sell,\" so be ready to mix your eBay sales posts with interesting and fun information."
