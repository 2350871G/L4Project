Buy several skeins of yarn that all have the same dye lot or you might notice subtle color variations between the skeins. Remember that the thicker the yarn, the warmer the leg warmers will be. You can certainly use thinner yarn, just be aware that they won't be as cozy as the ones made with bulkier yarn. Pick your crochet hook. This is basically determined by the type of yarn you've chosen. The yarn package should give a suggested hook size for use with that specific yarn. The hook size suggestion doesn't have to be followed, but your crocheting might turn out knotty or too loose. Create a small practice swatch to check your tension. These are usually about 4 inches (10.2 cm) by 4 inches (10.2 cm) and feature the same stitches you'll be using in the pattern itself. If you're holding the yarn too tightly, you may need to increase your hook size. Likewise, if your stitches are too loose, a smaller hook may be needed.

You'll essentially be crocheting one large rectangle before joining it together. The longest part of that rectangle should match the length you'd like for your leg warmers. Crocheting Your Leg Warmers Make a slipknot. Make a loop about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the free end of the yarn. The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook. Chain 100 single crochet stitches.

You'll now have single crochet stitches. Chain 1 stitch, then turn. Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row. Do half-double crochet stitches across until you reach your last 10 stitches, then single crochet those last ten. To half-double crochet, yarn over your hook once and skip the first 2 stitches on your row. Insert your hook into the center of the third stitch. Yarn over one and then pull all 3 stitches through the chain. You'll have 3 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull the 3 stitches on your hook. Chain 1, then turn.
