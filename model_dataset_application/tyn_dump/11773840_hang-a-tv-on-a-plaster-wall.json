Generally, the center of a 42 in (110 cm) TV should be mounted 56 in (140 cm) from the floor, and larger TVs can be mounted a little higher to keep them at eye level. Make sure the TV is visible from different angles. Also, keep in mind the location of nearby power outlets.Mount the TV to an interior wall. It has to be done on a wall containing support beams, since a TV won\u2019t stay attached to bare plaster. To test the positioning, cut a piece of paper or cardboard and tape it to the wall.

It will beep if it detects one of the wooden support beams in the wall. Mark the location of each stud so you can use them to mount the TV.Finding the studs can be a little tricky since plaster tends to have horizontal supports called lath as well. The studs are oriented vertically, so the stud finder will stay lit when you move it up and down. The lath will be nailed to the studs, so you can detect the metal nails to pinpoint the location of the studs. Another way to do this is to buy a rare-earth magnet and hold it against the wall to see where it sticks. If you knock against the wall, the areas with studs will produce a higher-pitched sound.
