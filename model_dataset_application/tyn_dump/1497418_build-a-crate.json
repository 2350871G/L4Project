The remainder of the tutorial will be using biscuit joints. Dowels\nWood glue. Know, however, that this will not make a very strong box. With the wood pressed together, use a pencil to mark three spots for dowels or biscuit joints. Mark where you're going to adhere the boxes together on both blanks. For this tutorial, you'll use biscuit joints, though you can use any method you're comfortable with. Make sure you have three wooden biscuits as well as a biscuit drill. Three biscuit joiners for each end should be more than enough. If you're in a pinch, two will do. Use your biscuit joint drill to make notches at each mark. Like up the drill with your pencil marks and make a clean, quick cut with the drill. Repeat for the other 5 marks. Apply wood glue to all three biscuit holes on one of the planks. One solid line of glue along the entire edge should be fine. Insert a biscuit into each hole and firmly push it into place. Make sure each biscuit is snug inside the hole. Add a little more glue to the top of each biscuit, then attach the two boards together. Simply slot the biscuits into the slots on the other piece. Let the wood glue dry and your ends are finished.
