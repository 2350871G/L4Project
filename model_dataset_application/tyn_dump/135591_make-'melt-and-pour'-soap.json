You can find soap making rubber stamps alongside the rest of the soap making supplies in the arts and crafts stores. They are rubber sheets with raised designs, like ink stamps.

    "Add a surprise into clear, glycerin soap.",
    "This is a great idea for kids soap.",
    "Place a small, plastic toy, like a fish or spider, into the soap mold.",
    "Pour the soap into the mold, over the toy, then let it set.",
    "When you de-mold the soap, the toy will be embedded inside.",
    "This is not recommended for solid-colored or opaque soap; the toy will not show up.",
    "Stir two different colors together to make swirled soap.",
    "Melt your soap as usual, then split it into two batches.",
    "Add a different color and fragrance to each batch.",
    "Pour the melted soap, one color at a time, into the mold, then gently stir it together to create swirls.",
    "Do not over-stir the soap, however, or the colors will mix.",
    "If you want your soap to be white with colored swirls in it, do the following:\nMake your soap base as usual, but omit the dye.",
    "Pour the soap into the mold.",
    "Add a drop of dye into each corner and the middle.",
    "Stir the drops together using a toothpick.",
    "Pour differently-colored bases at different times to create layers.",
    "Prepare a half-batch of soap, and pour it into your mold.",
    "Prepare your next layer using the rest of the soap.",
    "Wait for the first layer to form a thick skin, then score it with a fork.",
    "Pour the second layer on top, and let the soap harden.",
    "Spray each layer with rubbing alcohol while it is still wet to reduce bubbles.",
    "This method works better with larger soap molds.",
    "De-mold the soap once it's hard, then slice it into smaller bars to show off the layers."
