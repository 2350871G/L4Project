If using charcoal, make a nice pile about the diameter of 75-80% of the total grill space, a couple inches high, and light with a match. Allow the coals to all catch, turn red, and stop emitting flames. Once most coals are glowing red and are silver/gray, you're ready."

Use a meat thermometer and insert it into the thickest part of the steak. Thermometer readings should be: 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) to 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C) for rare; 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C) to 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C). for medium rare and 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) to 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) for medium. Or...\nPress the meat with your finger. Rare meat will be soft and wobbly, medium will have a springy firmness and well done will feel very firm and unyielding."
