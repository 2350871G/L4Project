Drilling into metal can also cause sharp metal slivers to fly into your eyes. Wear a mask when drilling fiberglass to avoid inhaling fiberglass particles. Choose the mounting location for the hood pin, and drill a hole in the frame large enough for the mounting bolts. Refer to the installation manual that was supplied with the hood pins to determine which drill bit size to use. If you are using mounting brackets, drill holes in the frame according to the installation's directions. Thread the hood pin through the hole in the bracket, and secure with the provided bolt.  Place painters tape where the hood pins will be installed.  Dab a finger of petroleum jelly on the top of the hood pin, and gently lower the hood onto the hood pin. The petroleum jelly will make a mark into the painter's tape where you will need to drill the hole. Use a drill with the appropriate size drill bit, and drill the hole in the hood. You may also start with a smaller drill bit to make a guide hole, and then drill another with the correct-sized drill bit. Common-sized drill bits needed are 17/32 inch (13.49 mm) and 1/2 inch (12.7 mm). Smooth any rough edges in the hood pinhole. Use a Dremel tool with a sanding or grinding bit. Place the scuff plate over the hood pin, and use a pencil to mark the mounting holes.  Remove the scuff plate, and drill 4 holes.  Use the provided fasteners to secure the scuff plate into place.
