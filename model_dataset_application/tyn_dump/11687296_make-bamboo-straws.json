Opt for bamboo stalks that have at least 6\u201310 inches (15\u201325 cm) between nodes, which are the horizontal bands on the stalks. Avoid using stalks that are thicker than \u20444\u20131 inch (1.9\u20132.5 cm) since you may have difficulty using the straw. Look out for spotted or rotted bamboo since it could weaken your straw or have harmful bacteria. It\u2019s okay if the bamboo stalks have slight bends or angles as long as they\u2019re mostly straight."

Position the pruners so the blades make a 45-degree angle on the stalk and squeeze the handles tightly together. Leave at least 1\u20132 nodes on the bamboo so they can continue growing. Avoid making straight cuts since it can trap water and make the bamboo develop rot. You can also saw the bamboo stalks at a 45-degree angle with a hacksaw if you don\u2019t have pruners available."

Lean the bamboo vertically against a wall or rack to help guide any liquid inside down and out of the stalk. Let the bamboo completely dry out until it has a tan color, which usually takes around 2\u20133 weeks. Avoid laying the bamboo horizontally since it may not drain properly and could develop rot. If you plan on drying the bamboo outside, try to use a south-facing wall to ensure it receives sunlight throughout the entire day."

Hold the stalk firmly against your work surface with your nondominant hand and make a straight cut \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) over from the node using a hacksaw. Then remove the node on the other side of the straw, leaving a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) gap. Continue cutting straws from the entire length of the stalk. Usually, a 4 ft (1.2 m) section of bamboo will make between 4\u201316 straws depending on their lengths. Avoid making straws shorter than 6 inches (15 cm) since they may not be tall enough for most cups. Don\u2019t use pruners to cut dry bamboo since you could cause the stalks to crack or splinter easier.Tip: Make a few straws shorter and some longer so they can fit better in odd-sized glasses."
