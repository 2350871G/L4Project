You will need about 2 to 3 yards (1.8 to 2.7 m) of fabric depending on your size. If you are making leggings for a baby or toddler, then you will only need about 1 yard (0.91 m) of fabric. For baby and toddler leggings, you can also use a printed t-shirt for fabric. Make sure it is a shirt that you are willing cut up. You can use an old t-shirt or buy one on clearance."

You can opt for a narrow piece of elastic, such as a piece that is 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wide, or you can go with a wider piece, such as a piece that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. The elastic will be hidden in the waistband, so you can use any color."

Then, fold your leggings in half lengthwise and lay them out on the paper. Align the outer edge of the leggings with the edge of the paper. You will not need to trace along this edge.

Place pins along the inseam of the leg, but do not pin past the crotch area on the legging piece. After you pin up the inseam on one piece, do the same with the other piece. Sew along the inseam.
