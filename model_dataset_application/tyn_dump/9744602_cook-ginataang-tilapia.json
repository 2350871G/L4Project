The pan will appear to shimmer when the oil is hot enough to cook with. Choose an oil with a high smoke point that\u2019s suitable for frying, such as peanut, vegetable, or canola oil.

Once they begin to caramelize slightly, reduce the temperature of the cooktop to medium heat. Onions sometimes have to cook for quite a while before they lose their crunch, so it\u2019s a good idea to get them started ahead of the tilapia."

Let the mixture sit until the fish sauce just begins to bubble\u2014this should only take 1-2 minutes. For this recipe, it will be best to use a traditional Filipino patis, or a Vietnamese style fish sauce like nuoc mam. It\u2019s important to lower the cooking temperature before adding the fish sauce. Intense heat may cause sauces with added sugar to burn, which could affect the finished flavor of the dish."

Stir the aromatics, fish sauce, and coconut cream together vigorously until they\u2019re completely incorporated. As you did before, wait for the liquid components to come to a bubble before moving on. Use your spoon to scrape the remnants out of the jar or can. You don\u2019t want to waste any of that creamy goodness! You can also use raw, unsweetened coconut milk in place of the heavier coconut cream. However, this may cause the finished dish to take on a slightly soupier consistency."

After you\u2019ve gotten the seasoning just right, turn the cooktop down to low-medium heat to bring the base to a low simmer. Feel free to add any other spices or seasonings of choice at this point, such as fresh ground turmeric to impart earthy undertones or chili flakes to kick the heat up another notch. The heat should be low enough for the base to just bubble around the edges."

It will also help work out any remaining lumps in the rich coconut cream. Be sure to stir the base periodically to prevent it from congealing around the edges. Keep an eye on the pan to make sure it doesn\u2019t get too hot. Coconut cream is prone to scorching."

You may only be able to cook 2-3 fish at a time, depending on their size and the size of the pan. If you\u2019re making dinner for a crowd, it might be necessary to fix multiple batches.

By the 30 minute mark, it will have soaked up much of the complex flavor from the base. The meat inside should be nice and tender, with a soft white color and slightly flaky texture. Venting the pan will ensure that the components don\u2019t become soggy while also retaining a little moisture to prevent the base from reducing too much. If the tilapia still looks a little underdone after the first 30 minutes, continue simmering it for around 5 minutes at a time until it\u2019s cooked through."

These should be added in the last 3-5 minutes of cook time, as they don\u2019t take long to soften. Spinach will make an acceptable substitute if you\u2019re unable to find mustasa greens. If you\u2019re not big on spicy food, try using sliced bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, or other mild veggies in place of the hotter chilis."

Let the ingredients simmer for an additional minute or so to make sure they\u2019re nice and hot. When time\u2019s up, remove the pan from the cooktop, portion the tilapia, sauce, and veggies onto separate serving plates. Enjoy it while it\u2019s hot!
