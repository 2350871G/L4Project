All you need to do is rotate the foot carefully over an open flame to singe off as many hairs as you can. You can use a small, unscented tealight candle for this or a lighter. If you have a gas stove, you can turn on one burner to low heat and use that flame instead of a candle. Once you've singed most of them off, check for any hairs left on the foot and use a clean pair of tweezers to pluck them out."

    "Discard the cooking water.",
    "Rinse and roughly chop the 4 scallions, head of garlic, and ginger.",
    "Peel the 3 in (7.6 cm) piece of ginger and chop it roughly into 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) pieces.",
    "Peel the garlic and chop it roughly.",
    "Cut the 4 scallions into 0.5 in (1.3 cm) pieces, separating the white parts from the green parts.",
    "Break the dried chili peppers into pieces with your hands.",
    "Brown the seasonings, vegetables, and feet in 2 tablespoons (30 mL) oil.",
    "Add the oil to a large pot or Dutch oven over medium to low heat and let it warm up for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Add the white parts of the scallions, ginger pieces, 1 star anise, 1 cinnamon stick, 3 cloves, and 2-5 chili peppers.",
    "Stir these for 3-4 minutes, watching to make sure they aren't burning.",
    "Then, add the pig's feet pieces to the pan.",
    "Let them cook on both sides until they're browned.",
    "Wait to add the garlic, as it's more likely to burn.",
    "You can also use a deep wok.",
    "The oil should become glossier and thinner as it heats, making it easy to spread it over the bottom of the pan.",
    "Only add 2 dried chili peppers if you prefer a mild dish, while 5 will make it spicy.",
    "Add the rest of the ingredients to the pot.",
    "Pour in the 3 tablespoons (44 mL) rice wine, 5 tablespoons (74 mL) of soy sauce, and 4 cups (950 mL) water.",
    "Add in the 2 teaspoons (11.4 g) salt and 5 tablespoons (65 g) brown sugar.",
    "Stir to combine the ingredients.",
    "Simmer the feet over low heat for about 3 hours.",
    "Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to make sure the sugar and salt dissolve.",
    "Then, turn the heat down to low or medium-low, so the mixture simmers.",
    "Let it cook at this temperature for 3 hours.",
    "Make sure to stir the mixture every 15-30 minutes or so to make sure the feet get submerged.",
    "The sauce will eventually thicken.",
    "If this happens while the pig's feet still seem tough, add more water 1 cup (240 mL) at a time and continue cooking.",
    "Some cooks prefer only 1 hour to 1.5 hours of cooking time for this dish.",
    "Try it both ways to see what you like.",
    "Check for tenderness after 2.5 hours.",
    "At this point, start poking at the pig's feet with a knife or fork to see if the meat is tender.",
    "It should fall off the bones if it's tender enough.",
    "If not, continue cooking the mixture.",
    "If it's ready, go ahead and serve it.",
    "If the sauce still seems thin once the pig's feet are done, remove the lid and increase the heat to medium.",
    "Continue boiling until the sauce reduces and thickens.",
    "Serve the pig's feet warm.",
    "Transfer the finished pig's feet and sauce to individual serving dishes.",
    "This dish is great served over plain white rice, which will soak up the delicious juices.",
    "Grilling Pig's Feet Preheat your oven to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C).",
    "Turn the oven on so it can be heating up while you put the dish together.",
    "If you need it to cook a bit faster, you can turn it to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) instead.",
    "Place all the ingredients except the honey in a dutch oven.",
    "Add the 4-5 pig's feet, 0.25 cups (59 mL) sriracha, 0.5 cups (120 mL) apple cider vinegar, 0.5 millilitres (0.018 imp fl oz; 0.017  fl oz) water, and 2 teaspoons (4.8 g) salt in the dutch oven.",
    "Stir the ingredients around lightly to mix them together.",
    "Cook the pig's feet for 2.5-3 hours until they're tender.",
    "Check the meat after 2.5 hours to see if it's tender.",
    "When they're tender enough, you should be able to easily stab them with a fork.",
    "You don't want them to be so tender they fall off the bone, as they'll be hard to grill.",
    "If you need to, you can cook these the night before you grill them.",
    "Heat up charcoal in a grill.",
    "Gather all the charcoal in the middle or on one side of the grill, as you want to cook these over indirect heat.",
    "Pour lighter fluid on the charcoal.",
    "Light the charcoal by using long matches or a long-reach lighter.",
    "Let the charcoal heat up for 15 to 30 minutes.",
    "You'll need about 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of charcoal.",
    "Add the pig's feet to the grill when the charcoal is ashy and red.",
    "The charcoal will get ashy on the surface and be red underneath.",
    "Don't put the pig's feet directly over the charcoal.",
    "Instead, put it off to the side.",
    "Place it skin-side down.",
    "Grill the pig's feet for 30 minutes, using honey to baste them.",
    "Turn the pig's feet every 5-10 minutes and brush them with honey as you do.",
    "If they appear to be burning, move them further away from the heat.",
    "You can also baste them with barbecue sauce.",
    "Serve the pig's feet with barbecue sauce or on their own.",
    "These make good finger food for parties or as the main course for a meal.",
    "Try serving them with rice or mashed potatoes on the side."
