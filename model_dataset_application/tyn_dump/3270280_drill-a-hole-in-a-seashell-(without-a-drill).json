Set a small pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil. Place the shell in the water and let it boil for 5-6 minutes to kill off any bacteria. Then, turn off the stove, lift the shell out with a spoon, and let it cool on the counter for 5-10 minutes. If you bought the shell at a store, you don\u2019t have to boil it."

          "description":"When you\u2019re ready to start drilling, place the shell down on a flat surface with its inside (the concave curve of the shell) facing up. Decide where on the shell you want to make your hole, then use a pencil to mark it with a small dot.. The location choose typically depends on what you\u2019ll be using the shell for. Shells used for jewelry, for example, are often strung near the top or base, but you may also choose to drill through the middle depending on your design. The shell may be thicker near the base than it is at the top. This might make it harder to drill through, but will also lessen your chances of cracking the shell. You may want to place down a few layers of newspaper or an old placemat, as you might push through and puncture the surface under the shell."

Continue twisting and pressing down until you hear a slight pop and the thumbtack pushes through the other side. Thumbtacks are a good choice for smaller shells because they\u2019re sharp, but not so powerful that they\u2019ll break through the shell and crack it. You can also use a needle to make your hole."

If you\u2019re using a thicker string or chain, insert your thumbtack again and twist it more forcefully to make the hole bigger. You can also drill a second hole right next to the first one for a wider opening."
