    "For extra strength, screw a washer and nut onto the end of each bolt.",
    "Measure about 13 in (33 cm) up the legs to position the bench support.",
    "Measure from the bottom of the legs and use a pencil to mark them.",
    "Then, raise the 2 bench supports up and clamp them firmly in place.",
    "The bench supports will run across the legs, preventing them from moving.",
    "Make sure the bench supports extend beyond the legs.",
    "The bench supports also hold up the benches, which can\u2019t happen without that extra length of wood.",
    "Countersink the bench supports with 3 in (7.6 cm) carriage bolts.",
    "Attach the bench supports the same way you did the legs.",
    "Create 2 holes by drilling through the legs and into the supports.",
    "Position 1 hole along the bottom edge of the support and the leg\u2019s centermost edge.",
    "Make the second hole opposite of the first.",
    "Remember to drill a 1 in (2.5 cm) hole first, then drill a second, smaller hole directly in its center.",
    "Countersinking enables you to connect thin pieces of wood without breaking them.",
    "Place a washer and nut on the end of each bolt to strengthen it.",
    "Screw the braces to the bench supports and middle batten.",
    "Make sure braces fit firmly in place before you attach them.",
    "Position them so they are flush with the batten and the top edge of the supports.",
    "When you\u2019re sure they\u2019re steady, use a \u204432 in (0.40 cm) drill bit to pre-drill pilot holes.",
    "Finish the supports with several 3 in (7.6 cm) deck screws.",
    "Make the outer holes by drilling through the supports and into the braces.",
    "Make the inner holes by drilling through the braces and into the tabletop.",
    "To make your bench sturdy, install 2 screws on each end of the braces.",
    "You may need to measure and cut the braces again to make them fit.",
    "Use a speed square, pencil, and circular or miter saw for this.",
    "Finishing the Benches and Features Invert the table so it is standing on its legs.",
    "You are almost done constructing the table.",
    "Now is a good time to check its stability.",
    "Push against each component to see how sturdy the table feels.",
    "When you\u2019re satisfied, you are ready to create the seats.",
    "If any component wiggles, it may not be sturdy.",
    "Make sure the boards are flush and screwed tightly together.",
    "Align the bench boards together on a flat surface.",
    "Lay them on the ground or on a sawhorse.",
    "Make sure you put the better sides facedown, since they will form the top part of each seat.",
    "Keep the edges of the boards flush with one another and separate them using \u20444 in (0.64 cm) wood spacers or nails.",
    "Connect 2 boards per bench.",
    "Keep the benches separate.",
    "Attach the cleats to each bench.",
    "Spread a line of polyurethane adhesive along the bench\u2019s width.",
    "Then, press the cleat onto it directly in the center.",
    "Drill a pair of \u204432 in (0.40 cm) wide pilot holes through each cleat and into the bench boards.",
    "Screw them in place with 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) deck screws.",
    "Place the holes about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) away from the edges of each cleat.",
    "For additional stability, create 4 more cleats.",
    "Place them as close to the ends of the benches as possible.",
    "Screw the bench boards to the support boards.",
    "Lay the benches over the supports so the cleats face the ground.",
    "Locate the points where each board meets the supports.",
    "Along the center of each board, drill down into the support.",
    "Place more 3 in (7.6 cm) deck screws to secure the benches in place.",
    "You will need to create 2 holes for each board for a total of 4 holes per bench.",
    "Cut the corners off the tabletop at a 45 degree angle.",
    "Use a saber saw or router to round off the table\u2019s edges.",
    "Remove about 2 in (5.1 cm) off of each corner.",
    "Work carefully to ensure the table looks even on all sides.",
    "While doing this is optional, it is recommended to prevent injuries from anyone bumping into sharp corners.",
    "Sand the table with 220-grit sandpaper.",
    "Rub the sandpaper lightly along the table\u2019s grain.",
    "This will eliminate any splinters or rough edges.",
    "Feel the table with your hand afterwards.",
    "Make sure it feels smooth to the touch.",
    "Avoid pressing too hard.",
    "If the sandpaper leaves scratches on the table, use less pressure.",
    "Seal the wood to waterproof it if you desire.",
    "Try using a silicone or polyurethane sealer or wood stain.",
    "Spread the sealer or stain over the wood evenly with a rag, then let it dry for about 2 hours or the length of time specified by the manufacturer.",
    "Recoat the wood once or twice to protect your picnic table from the elements.",
    "Wood stain products turn the wood a darker color.",
    "Apply the stain in a light initial layer, then add more in subsequent layers until the table reaches the shade you desire."
