If you'd like to make an easy pan sauce, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of dry white wine into the skillet that you cooked the fish in. Stir and heat the wine over high heat until it's reduced in volume by 1/3. Then turn off the burner and stir in 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter and 2 tablespoons (17 g) of drained capers. Heating the wine in the skillet with the drippings is called deglazing. Deglazing the skillet is a great way to add extra flavor to the mild Chilean Sea Bass."

Try eating the fish with roasted asparagus or garlic mashed potatoes. Although you can refrigerate the leftover fillets in an airtight container for up to 3 to 4 days, the fish will become soft and lose its crispy texture."
