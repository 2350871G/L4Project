  "text":" Prepping the Meat Choose a tough cut of meat. This is also usually a healthier choice because of low fat content. The act of marinating will soften the first few centimeters of a round, hanger, skirt, flank or sirloin cut. Defrost the meat completely. The best way to do this is to place frozen meat in a sealed container in your refrigerator overnight. Ensure that the meat is defrosted about 12 to 24 hours before you plan to eat it, so that you can marinate it for an adequate amount of time. Pierce thicker cuts of meat with a knife in several places. This is only recommended for cuts that have very little fat content. It will help the marinade sink deeper into the beef. Place your beef in a non-reactive covered bowl or plastic bag. Glass or plastic work best. Marinating the Meat Mix your marinade. Add one part acid, one part oil, one part aromatics and salt and/or sugar to taste. The following are excellent ingredients to use in marinades:\nThe best acids for meat are vinegar, lemon juice lime juice, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. If you use soy sauce, don\u2019t add extra salt, since it is a main ingredient in the sauce. The best oils are neutral oils, like canola oil and olive oil. Granulated sugar or honey adds sweetness and also encourages a brown color and caramel taste. Use aromatics like crushed garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, ginger, bay leaf or steak seasoning. Paprika, chili pepper and jalapenos or other fresh peppers are perfect for a spicy, smoky flavor. Whisk the marinade together. Grab a spoon and taste a small amount. The marinade should taste good before it goes on the beef, since the majority of the marinade will stay in the first few cm of the surface. Consider replacing lime, lemon or vinegar with fresh pineapple or kiwi juice if your meat is very tough. The enzymes penetrate the meat and help tenderize it if used for two hours or less. Pour the marinade into the plastic bag or bowl. Turn the beef to coat it entirely. Place it in the refrigerator for no less than two hours and no more than 24 hours. The longer the beef is marinated, the more intense the flavor will be. Cooking Marinated Meat Remove the dish or plastic bag from the refrigerator. Take the beef out of the bag or container. Shake it lightly to remove extra marinade. Don\u2019t leave garlic gloves on the surface, or they may burn on the surface. Place the beef on a plate. Let it sit out until it comes to room temperature. This should take at least 20 minutes or up to one hour. Cook the beef on a grill, in a pan or in the oven.
