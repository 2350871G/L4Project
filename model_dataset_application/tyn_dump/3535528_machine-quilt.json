Check the needles you are using. A quilting needle is sharper than a universal needle and makes a smaller point. For metallic threads use a metallic or embroidery needle. Use a fine cotton thread 30 or 40 with a size 70 needle. Loosen the top tension if any bottom thread shows. Always work a sample. Fix the layers with safety pins or machine stitch rows with dissolving (soluble) thread. If you hand tack, the thread can get caught on the machine foot and drag your stitching. Use a walking foot for machine fed quilting if you have one."
