As you do, the bristles will push whatever kind of detritus that\u2019s found its way onto the floor in the direction you\u2019re sweeping. The shorter your strokes, the more control you\u2019ll have. The idea is to get all of the debris into one central place, not just whisk it around aimlessly. Resist the urge to sweep too fast or too forcefully. Doing so can send clouds of dust billowing up, only to settle back down on the section you just swept."
