Now you can just draw 2 small circles about a centimeter above the irises. This is the detailed part of the eyes. After you've done the sketch of the eyes you can do the nose. This is just an upside-down rounded-off triangle. Inside of that triangle, draw 2 evenly spaced dots, nostrils, very small. But not so small you can't see it. Now draw a line coming down from the nose coming down to the left in a curve, the same on the other side.  Add 3 dots in the curve of those parts.
