Most boards wrap back and forth, so you move left to right across first row, then move up to the second and move right to left, and so on. Follow the numbers on the board to see how to move forward. For example, if you rolled a five and you were on space number 11, then you would move your game piece to space number 16."

If two or more people roll the same number, and it is the highest number rolled, each of those people roll the die an additional time to see who gets to go first."

For example, if you roll a two, move your piece to square two. On your next turn, if you roll a five, move your piece forward five squares, ending up on square seven. Some people play that you can only move onto the board if you roll a one, and if you don't get a one, you just skip your turn.

If you land at the top of a ladder or somewhere in the middle of a ladder, just stay put. You never move down ladders."

For example, if you are on square 99 and roll a four, move your game piece to 100 (one move), then \"bounce\" back to 99, 98, 97 (two, three, then four moves.)
