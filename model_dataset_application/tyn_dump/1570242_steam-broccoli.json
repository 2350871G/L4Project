  "text":" Preparing the Broccoli for Steaming Choose fresh broccoli with a deep green head and a slighter green stalk. Look for broccoli that isn't turning brown, and avoid broccoli that is wilted or bruised. The florets should be tightly closed. You can also steam frozen broccoli. You do not have to defrost it before steaming it. Wash the broccoli. Rinse it thoroughly in water, using your fingers to rub away any dirt or debris. Frozen broccoli does not need to be rinsed, since it is washed before being packed. Cut the broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Place the broccoli on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut off the individual broccoli florets.

Frozen broccoli usually comes pre-chopped. Examine the broccoli to make sure the pieces are the size you want. Chop them smaller if you wish. Steaming Broccoli on the Stove Fill a pot with about an inch of water. You will be using this pot to steam the broccoli, so make sure that it is large enough to hold the broccoli and the steamer pot. Place the pot on the stove. Place a steamer basket inside the pot. The bottom of the basket should not be touching the water. If you don't have a steamer basket, use a colander instead. If you don't have a colander, you may place the broccoli directly in the water. You will need only a few tablespoons of water. Make sure the water doesn't completely cover the broccoli.

They should fit easily into the bowl and not come up past the rim. Consider seasoning the broccoli with some salt, pepper, or butter. For more ideas, click here. Pour some water into the bowl. You will need two to three tablespoons of water per pound (1/2 kilogram) of broccoli. Cover the bowl with a lid. Make sure that the lid does not have any metal on it. If you don't a lid, then you can cover the bowl with a plate; make sure that the plate fits snugly over the top of the bowl. Avoid using plastic wrap. While not dangerous, plastic wrap can melt; the holes will allow the steam to escape, resulting in under-cooked broccoli. Do not use aluminum foil to cover the bowl. This is not a microwave-safe material. Microwave the broccoli on high for three to four minutes. You can check for doneness after two and a half minutes by taking the bowl out of the microwave and poking the broccoli with a fork. If the broccoli is soft and tender, it is ready; if the broccoli is hard, then you will need to cook it some more. Remove the broccoli from the microwave. Transfer it to a serving dish and serve it hot; do not let it sit or it will lose its color. Consider seasoning the broccoli with salt, pepper, or garlic. For more ideas, click here. Seasoning and Flavoring the Broccoli Flavor the water. Before you start heating the water, consider flavoring it with some lemon juice or soy sauce. The steam that comes from this water will lightly flavor the broccoli. Season the broccoli before steaming it. In a small cup, mix together some olive oil, salt, and pepper. Lightly toss the broccoli with this mixture before you steam it. Add some butter to the broccoli before or after you steam it. Be sure to toss the broccoli before serving it so that each piece gets coated with the melted butter. Season the broccoli with herbs and spices after you steam it. You can sprinkle some garlic powder, salt, or pepper over the broccoli just before serving it. You can also add some fresh herbs, such as fresh herbs: dill, parsley, or thyme. Give plain broccoli a kick of flavor with some garlic. Try adding some chopped or sliced garlic to the broccoli before or after you steam it. You can also toss the steamed broccoli with some chopped garlic that has been saut\u00e9ed in olive oil. Add a burst of flavor and freshness with some lemon. After you have steamed the broccoli, try tossing it with some lemon zest or a few lemon slices. Sprinkle some grated cheese over the steamed broccoli. Let the cheese melt a little, then toss the broccoli to mix it all together. Consider using Parmesan cheese and a bit of garlic powder.",
