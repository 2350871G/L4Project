Here are some items to ask about when dealing with the rental company:\nWeight capacity. Aerial lifts can raise a load of between 500 and 1000 pounds. If more than one person will be needed in the basket, along with their tools, a larger capacity lift will probably be needed. Fuel type. Aerial lifts typically use either gasoline, diesel, or liquefied petroleum gas (propane, for example). You will want to choose a lift that you can obtain fuel for if you plan to use it extensively. Terrain type. Aerial lifts come in either two wheel drive or four wheel drive, and have different tire treads (or even bulldozer-like tracks for soft or sandy soils). If your project will be done on sloping or very soft ground, an aerial lift might not be a good choice at all. Reach. Aerial lifts range from 30 feet (9.1 m) to over 100 feet (30.5 m) in vertical reach. They also can extend horizontally, but telescoping out at a low boom angle reduces the lift's weight capacity and stability."

If you are working in the basket and the machine runs out of fuel, you may be stranded if no one is around to use the auxiliary controls to lower the machine from the ground control panel. Tire condition. Never operate an aerial lift with underinflated tires, or tires showing damage which may cause them to fail. When an aerial lift is operating under load, a rapidly deflating tire can cause the machine to overbalance and turn over. Hydraulic hoses should be inspected for damage, leaks, kinking, or exposure to abrasion. Repair or replace any hoses that appear to be in danger of failing. Fire extinguisher should be mounted in an easily accessible location. Check the oil and coolant levels in the lift's engine. Make sure all access panels are secured.
