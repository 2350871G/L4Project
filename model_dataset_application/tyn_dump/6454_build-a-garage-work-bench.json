  "text":" Build a Custom-Sized Workbench Determine the dimensions of the Workbench. Measure the desired length, width, and height relative to your work space and write these dimensions down. Find a bench top.

For a thick, sturdy, affordable alternative, salvage a solid-core door; check your local listings, find a rebuilding center, or even ask around at a building undergoing renovation. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the Workbench should be flat and sturdy. Cut the bench top to size if necessary. Cut four legs from 4x4s. The length of each leg should be the desired height of the bench minus the thickness of the bench top. Cut four leg braces from 2x4s.

Simply measure the dimensions between all four legs, cut a shelf to this size from your desired material (ex. plywood), and screw into place. Finish the bench if desired. Sand the wood smooth and apply stain, varnish, polyurethane, etc. Build a Sturdy Floating Shelf to Use as a Workbench Attach a long 2x4 (38\u00d789 mm) horizontally to the wall studs. (If your wall is solid brick, stone, etc., this method will not help you). The length of the 2x4 will be the length of the workbench and should be sized accordingly. (In this example, we are using a 16-foot / 4.8-meter piece.) Use a spirit level to make sure that this is attached horizontally.

Use 2.5-in / 6.5 cm screws (or 3-in / 7.5-cm screws if going through drywall) to attach the 4-in (89-mm) flat face against the garage wall studs. Attach another piece of timber of the same dimensions below the first one. The gap between the two parallel strips should be determined by the length of the steel shelf bracket. Attach the shelf brackets to the two strips. The heavier duty the shelf bracket, the better. The top of the bracket is flush with the top surface of the upper strip.

If desired, shelf brackets can be alternated; heavy duty, lighter duty, heavy duty, etc. in order to accommodate toolbox placement and to be able to comfortably pull up a chair underneath the workbench. Cut 3/4-in (2-cm) thick plywood into 2-ft (.6-m) wide planks. A 4x8 ft (1.2 x 2.4 m) sheet will work well for this purpose. Place one of the planks on the shelf brackets and screw the plank to the upper strip at the top/rear. Place the second plank next to (left or right of) the first one and join the two end-to-end with a 6 in (15.25cm) x 18 in (45.7 cm) piece of plywood underneath the two plank ends. Place another strip across the top of the shelf and screw into the wall studs.  Apply a front strip along the bottom edge of the shelf. Glue and screw a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) by 3/4 in (1.9 cm) maple strip that's as long as your shelf. This strengthens the Workbench top while absorbing wear and tear. Attach drawers to the underside of the shelf. These thin drawers will accommodate any small tools you may have. The drawers should be 2 feet (.6 meter) wide, have a depth of 1.5 in (3.8 cm), and stretch 18 in (45.7 cm) to the back.
