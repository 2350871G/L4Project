You can use a vanishing fabric marker to mark out the measurements on the fabric if you need. If you are looking for inexpensive and thick fabric, canvas drop cloths are an ideal choice. These can be purchased from home improvement or craft stores. You can bleach the canvas drop cloth first to turn it white if you prefer. The standard size for a bed pillow is 20 in \u00d7 26 in (51 cm \u00d7 66 cm). Rectangles that are 21 in \u00d7 27 in (53 cm \u00d7 69 cm) will give you enough room for the seam allowance. However, you can also make custom sizes by simply measuring and cutting out 2 rectangles in the size that you need. Oversized lumbar pillows are also popular choices for bed pillows.

Use a sewing machine to sew neatly around the edges of the rectangle, with a seam allowance that is approximately \u20442 in (1.3 cm) for each edge. Leave a small gap along one of the short edges that is approximately 4 in (10 cm) so that you are able to stuff the pillow. Avoid leaving a corner open to stuff the pillow. This is because corners can be difficult to close up, so try to pick a short edge of the fabric instead. The seam allowance is the distance from the edge of the fabric to the seam. A \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance means that you will sew \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in from the each edge. This is generally the size of the pressure foot on the sewing machine, which makes measuring the seam allowance easy. Double stitch over the corners if you are worried that they are too weak and won\u2019t hold."

Sew together and then stuff each pillow insert before choosing pillowcases. Making a Pillow Bed Get 5 pillows and a twin flat sheet. Either purchase new pillows from a department or homeware store or use old pillows that you no longer need. You also need a twin flat sheet that measures 66 in \u00d7 96 in (170 cm \u00d7 240 cm). Alternatively, you can use a sheet of a different size. Simply measure it out and cut it to size before you begin. Making a pillow bed is a great way to use up old pillows and sheets that would otherwise be gathering dust. There are many options available for twin flat sheets. Pick a bright sheet in your preferred color, a neutral tone for a simpler look, or try out a patterned sheet for a bold style. Measure 19.5 in (50 cm) in from each long edge of the sheet. Lay the twin flat sheet out on a large table. Use a ruler to measure 19.5 in (50 cm) from each long edge toward the center. Mark each measurement using a vanishing fabric marker. This leaves a width of 27 in (69 cm) in the center. Fold the measurement lines over the center of the sheet. Fold the 19.5 in (50 cm) edge on the right side over the center of the sheet. Then fold the opposite, left side edge over the center of the sheet. The left side will overlap the right. The width of the sheet will now be 27 in (69 cm). The overlapping parts of the sheet means that the pillows are able to stay in place. Pin the sheet together along both short edges. Use sewing pins to hold each short edge together. Make sure that the sheet feels securely held together at both the top and the bottom. Use a vanishing fabric marker to mark 4 lines down the sheet every 19 in (48 cm). Use a ruler to mark every 19 in (48 cm) down the long edge of the sheet. Draw across the sheet with a vanishing fabric marker to connect the markings. Alternatively, you can use pins or tailor\u2019s chalk instead of a vanishing fabric marker. The end result will look like 4 evenly spaced lines running across the sheet. Sew over the pins and markings that run across the sheet. Use a sewing machine to sew 6 lines across the sheet. Use the straight stitch setting and start at the top of the sheet to close the top edge. Sew through each line, then be sure to close the bottom edge. The sheet will now have 6 lines of stitching running crosswise. This creates 1 pocket for each of the 5 pillows. It may be helpful to roll up the remaining part of the sheet while you are sewing so that it doesn\u2019t get in the way. Insert the 5 pillows into the pillow bed sheet. Open each pocket of the pillow bed sheet by lifting the overlapping fold in the center. Gently push 1 pillow into each pocket. Ensure that the overlapping fabric rests flat once you have placed each pillow. Once you have inserted the pillows, the pillow bed is now ready to use and enjoy. You can easily remove each pillow in the same way if you want to wash the pillow bed sheet. Follow the same process to make extra pillow beds.
