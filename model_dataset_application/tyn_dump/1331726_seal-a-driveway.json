After cutting through as many roots as possible, insert the shovel underneath them. Now, lever the weeds from the soil. Use a power edge trimmer to remove small patches of grass along the perimeter of your driveway. Always hold the trimmer level and rigid, taking care to move your body instead of your arms."

If you have a power washer, use its soap nozzle to apply the driveway cleaner. Otherwise, use a garden hose applicator. Be sure to cover the entire surface of the driveway. Now, scrub the surface of the driveway using a push broom. Afterward, clear out the dirt and soap residue using a steady stream of water from your power washer nozzle or garden hose. If you're using your power washer to clear the dirt and soap, use the 40-degree nozzle setting."

Sealant usually comes in 5 gallon (19 L) containers, which can cover as much as 400 square feet (37 m). Consider a driveway that is 10 by 30 feet (3.0 by 9.1 m): this means the total area is 300 square feet (28 m), which requires one 5 gallon (19 L) bucket of sealant."
