The side with the glue needs to be on the inside to hold the bead together. Once the glue dries \u2013 usually about 20 seconds \u2013 you will have a bead. After the glue has dried, remove the straw from the bead. Repeat to make the rest of your beads. Be sure to glue and then wrap each bead one at a time. If you apply glue to multiple pieces of cardboard and then wrap them, the glue will likely dry on some before you wrap them. You can wrap multiple beads on the same straw."
