          "description":"Baking soda is a classic organic fungicidal ingredient. For it to be effective on plants, it needs an oil and a detergent to help it stick to leaves. Mix 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of vegetable oil and 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of dish soap into 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. Stir the ingredients so they are mixed, and transfer the solution into a clean, empty spray bottle. You can also use an oil-based soap, such as Murphy\u2019s oil soap, instead of separate oil and soap ingredients. Simply use 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of oil soap with 4 tablespoons (56 g) of baking soda in 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. Try substituting potassium bicarbonate for baking soda. Potassium bicarbonate can be less harsh and just as effective as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) on plants."

Do not use more than the listed amount of vinegar, as too high of a vinegar concentration can burn your plant.
