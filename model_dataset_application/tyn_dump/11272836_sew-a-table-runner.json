Place a measuring tape or yardstick across the table to visualize how big you want the runner to be. Then, write down your measurements and add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the length and width numbers. For example, you might want a 2 by 8 feet (0.61 m \u00d7 2.44 m) runner, so you'd write down 25 by 97 inches (0.64 m \u00d7 2.46 m) after adding the 1 inch (2.5 cm) to each measurement."
