To avoid ruining carpet or hardwood with spilled beer, pick a spot that has durable flooring, like concrete or tile, or somewhere outdoors. If you don't have an 8 by 4 ft (2.4 by 1.2 m) rectangular table, you can use a different size table, as long as it's at least 6 feet (72 in) long. You can use a folding table or make your own table by laying a sheet of plywood on 2 sawhorses or structures of similar height."

Try to line up the chairs so that the 2 chairs on 1 side of the table are directly across from the 2 chairs on the other side."

For a quick measurement, the width of your closed fist is about the equivalent of how far the cup should be from the side.
