Ideally, you should be able to feel heat radiating from the surface of the pan before you pour in the oil. Hold your hand a few inches above the pan. If you can only hold your hand in this position for a few seconds before the temperature becomes too much, the pan is ready for toasting."

Keep the liquid moving during its entire cooking time to prevent possible burning of the sesame oil. The sesame oil is properly toasted when it acquires a golden brown color. In addition, a rich, nutty scent will begin to develop. When this occurs, remove the pan from the heat source."
