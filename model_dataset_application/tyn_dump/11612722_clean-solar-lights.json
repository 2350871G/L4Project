If you clean your panels monthly, then this may be all you need to clean them. Make sure to squeeze out the cloth or sponge before wiping the bulb.

Then rub the panel until all the soap is gone. You may have to re-wet the cloth to remove all the soap. You could also run the panel under a faucet, but make sure to keep the water away from the light\u2019s internal electronics. These are underneath the panel and inside the light globe. Keep the water focused on the panel itself and don\u2019t let the underside get wet."
