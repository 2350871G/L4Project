This should allow it enough time to reach room temperature and soften. If it starts to melt, place it back in the refrigerator. Sift the powdered sugar before starting. Pour the sugar into a sifter and sift into a large bowl. Place softened butter in a large bowl and stir until it is a smooth consistency. Sift the cocoa powder onto the butter, then fold until combined. To fold, start at the back of the bowl and place the spatula into the batter until it hits the bottom of the bowl. Lift the batter over the top of the top ingredient. Then, turn the bowl slightly and repeat. This method will gently mix the ingredients together. Sift in half the powdered sugar. Fold the batter until completely mixed. Then add the rest of the sugar and fold until the batter is blended and smooth. You can change the consistency of the icing by adding milk.
