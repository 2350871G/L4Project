Keep in mind, many people may find this chili sauce to be extremely spicy. Taste test after you mix your mayo up to determine if you should add more chili, or perhaps water it down by adding more mayo. Keep whisking until the ingredients are completely combined. There should be no streaks of hot sauce running through the mayo. Instead, the color should be completely uniform."

Lemon juice is not necessary, but if you sample the spicy mayo and decide that it is too hot for your preference, adding a little lemon juice can help cut down on some of the heat. Since the lemon juice will be harder to see than the hot sauce, you will need to make a rough estimate about whether or not the juice has been completely mixed in. Do this by mixing it in for approximately as long as you mixed in the hot sauce."

The essential thing is that the oil must be added slowly and evenly. Otherwise, the texture will not be consistent. Pause the blender every now and then when it starts to get hot.

    "Fresh horseradish will be significantly more potent than pre-made, so caution is needed when chopping it.",
    "To prepare it, simply chop up your horseradish root.",
    "Pour it into a food processor, add a few drops of water, and grind it up.",
    "Now you\u2019ll have a paste similar to pre-made horseradish.",
    "When using fresh, you may wish to lower the amount called for in your recipe by half or more.",
    "Always remember it is easier to make something more spicy, than it is to make something less spicy.",
    "Combine all your ingredients.",
    "Using a whisk, mix your mayonnaise, horseradish, chives, lemon juice and pepper.",
    "Whisk until the color of the mayonnaise is solid, and even.",
    "There should be no streaks.",
    "Use a metal or glass bowl when making horseradish mayo.",
    "Horseradish is significantly more pungent than onions or chilis, and making your mayo in a plastic dish can leave a smell or flavour that is less-than-desirable after removing the mayo.",
    "Cover and refrigerate until you wish to devour your spicy horseradish mayo.",
    "Your mayonnaise will improve in flavour, but also spiciness, with age.",
    "If you can, make it the night before it is needed so the flavours have time to blend together and become more full."
