Listed below are the types of transfers that work with heat presses and t-shirts:\nInk jet transfers are translucent and work best on white or light-colored shirts. You can print your own using an ink jet printer and special transfer paper. This won't work with a laser printer. Laser copier/printer transfers are also translucent. You can create them on a laser copier or printer using special transfer paper. Supplier and store-bought transfers are pre-printed. They are opaque and suitable for colored shirts, including dark colors (unless otherwise noted). Embroidered appliqu\u00e9s and patches also work with heat presses. They must have a heat activated adhesive on the back, however. Die cut vinyl lettering also work. You can layer them on top of each other to create different designs.
