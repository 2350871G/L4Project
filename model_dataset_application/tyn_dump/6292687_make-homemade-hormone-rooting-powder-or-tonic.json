You can also use purified or filtered water if you\u2019re worried about any foreign substances in your tap water. Stir in 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of honey and let the solution cool.

You can also dip the end of your cutting in honey before planting it in the ground for an additional layer of protection from fungus and bacteria.

Press the back of a spoon on the point of the leaf and apply firm pressure as you guide the spoon toward the cut end.

Use a spoon to stir the powder into the water until it completely dissolves.
