A 2 in (5.1 cm) PVC tee. A \u20442 in (1.3 cm) coupling. A 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) 45-degree elbow joint. A 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) 90-degree elbow joint. Fit the 1 \u20448 in (3.5 cm) pipes into the tee. The tee is just a T-shaped connector, so it\u2019s not too tough to deal with. The cut pipe lengths fit directly inside the opposing ends of the tee. Push them all the way in until they are flush with the tee. Take your time to ensure the pipes are positioned correctly. Consider setting up all the pipes first, then cementing them together once you\u2019re sure they are in the right place. Slide a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) pipe and elbow through the tee. Start by placing a 45-degree elbow joint on one end of the pipe. Then, slide the pipe all the way through the tee. Make sure the elbow joint is up against the tee. Mark the opposite end of the pipe about 1 in (2.5 cm) past where it emerges from the other end of the tee. The 45-degree elbow joint is a connecting piece designed to join straight pipes together at an angle. The extra length at the end is needed to connect this component to the rest of the mechanism. Cut the long pipe according to the spot you marked earlier. Fit the pipe into a miter box or clamp to hold it still. Then, cut off the excess length. Smooth the cut as needed with a utility knife to eliminate any sharp edges. Order a miter box online or at a hardware store if you plan on using one. The box holds the PVC pipes in place while you cut it with a saw. You could gently sand the edges with 120-grit sandpaper to smooth them out. Be careful around any cut pipes that feel sharp. Spread some PVC cement on the exposed end of the pipe. Select PVC cement to ensure the connections are as strong and waterproof as you can make them. PVC cement generally comes with an applicator brush you can use to spread the product around the opening of the pipe. The glue goes on the outside of the exposed pipe, since you will be putting a connector over it. PVC cement is a special kind of glue used to ensure PVC pipes stick together and stay waterproof. It\u2019s usually sold in buckets at hardware stores. Make sure the pipe is clean before applying the cement. Dirt and moisture could prevent it from working properly. Place a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) coupling on the end of the pipe. A coupling is a small piece of PVC that joins other pipes together. Position it on the end of the tee opposite from the 45-degree elbow joint. Make sure it is also flush with the end of the tee. Pick up at least 1 PVC coupling when you purchase the PVC pipes you need. It\u2019s important for hooking straight pipes to one another. Make sure you are able to rotate the pipe freely inside the tee without having it slide out. It\u2019s necessary for the dumping mechanism to work properly. Set an 8 \u20442 in (22 cm) pipe and elbow on the coupling. Select a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) pipe for this component. Add cement to the outside, then slide the pipe into the coupling. Then, put a 90-degree elbow joint on the end of that pipe. Turn the elbow so it faces away from you. The 90-degree elbow is a connecting piece like the 45-degree one, but it joins pipes at less of a steep angle. That makes it useful for arranging pipes in a square or another consistent formation. Arrange the pipes so the opening of the 45-degree elbow faces downward. If you plan on adjusting it later, wait to add the cement until you\u2019re sure you have all the pipes positioned correctly. Position a 10 in (25 cm) pipe on the 90-degree elbow. Use a pipe that is 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) in diameter. Add glue to the end, then push it as far as you can into the elbow. Twist it clockwise until it is tightly in place. Secure a long pipe to the bottom of the tee. Finish the mechanism by plugging a 19 \u20442 in (50 cm)-long pipe into the tee. Use a PVC pipe with a diameter of 2 in (5.1 cm), the same as the tee\u2019s opening. Add cement to secure the pipe in place. Creating the Dunk Tank Frame Purchase and cut additional PVC for the frame. The simplest way to build the frame is with PVC, although you could also use wood. PVC is easy to plug in and glue together. It\u2019s also sturdier and easier to take apart than wood. You will need:\n4 2 in \u00d7 60 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 152.4 cm) pipes. 7 {2 in \u00d7 30 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 76.2 cm) pipes. 4 2 in \u00d7 13 \u20442 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 34.3 cm) pipes. 2 2 in \u00d7 10 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 25.4 cm) pipes. 2 2 in \u00d7 6 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 15.2 cm) pipes. 2 2 in \u00d7 1 \u20442 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 3.8 cm) pipes. Build the base of the frame out of the 3 in (7.6 cm) pipes. The dunk tank\u2019s frame is essentially a cage built out of PVC. To build the base, arrange the pipes in a square. Plug the ends of each pipe into 3-way PVC elbow joints. Use cement to secure the pipes together. A 3-way elbow joint is very similar to a tee, but the openings are set at different angles. Tees are good for joining parallel pipes, but 3-ways are better for joining ones placed perpendicularly. Keep the PVC pipes positioned at 90-degree angles so the base forms a perfect square. Position the connecting joints so the free ends are face up. Fit the 60 in (150 cm) pipes into the elbows on the base. If you plan on taking the tank apart, don\u2019t add cement to these pipes. These pipes will form the middle part of the tank, which will connect the base to the top platform holding the bucket of water. The length of these pipes can be adjusted if you need to change the height of the tank. Make sure these pipes fit well into the elbow joints. They need to stand up straight to stabilize the tank\u2019s top platform. Glue 3-way elbow joints to the remaining 30 in (76 cm) pipes. You will basically make a second frame, but this one is a little more complicated than the one used for the base. Don\u2019t glue all of the pipes and connectors together yet. Instead, arrange the pipes in a square first. Then, secure the left and right pipes to the elbow joints. Turn the elbow joints so the free end faces downward. Those openings will line up with the pipes on the rest of the tank. Create a top frame using several pipes and a tee. Place a 30 in (76 cm) pipe between the connecting joints on the right side of the frame. For the opposite side, slide a pair of 13 \u20442 in (34 cm) pipes into the connecting joints. Place a T-shaped connector between them and cement everything together. You need the tee to set up some pipes in the center in order to hold the bucket and flushing mechanism. Don\u2019t glue the frame pipes together without adding the tee first! Rotate the tee so the open end points upward. This is where you will attach the dunking mechanism later. Secure 13 \u20442 in (34 cm) pipes to the joints. Position these pipes along the upper and lower ends of the frame. For consistency, glue them to the connecting joints on the right. This side will be the front part of the frame. Attach 10 in (25 cm) pipes to the left end of the frame. Take 2 of the pipes and fit them into the open ends of the connecting joints on the left. Glue them in place as well. These pipes will be used to form the back part of the frame. These pipes are shorter than the ones on the right side so you can fit elbow joints on the frame. It is necessary to create a platform for the dumping mechanism. Complete the outer edge of the frame with pipes and tees. Slide a T-shaped connector onto the end of each of the frame points. You will need 4 tees in total, 2 for the upper and lower end of the frame. Slide a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) pipe between each joint. Then, use cement to bond all of the pipes and connectors. Position the tees so the open end points toward the center of the dunk tank. This part will be used to make a platform for the bucket. Cement the remaining 30 in (76 cm) pipes between the tees. Place the pipes in the center of the frame. Run a pipe from a tee on the top part of the frame to one on the bottom. Make sure everything is flush and well-connected before you allow the PVC cement to dry. Adjust the pipes as needed before the cement dries. It makes them difficult to disconnect, so don\u2019t cement anything you plan on taking apart. Set the top frame onto the rest of the dunk tank to complete it. The top frame fits onto the cage like the bottom frame did. Use the 3-way corner joints to position the frame. The exposed openings in the joints fits right on top of the long pipes used for the body of the tank. You don\u2019t need to glue the frame to the long pipes. If you plan on taking apart the tank for storage, don\u2019t glue them. However, check the frame to make sure it\u2019s stable on top of the tank. Connecting the Target and Mechanism Place the bucket and dunking mechanism on top of the tank. Set the long pipe from the dunking mechanism into the tee on the top frame. Cement it in place to secure it. Next, position the bucket over the small pipes in the center of the frame. Rotate it so the flapper valve faces the overhanging pipe on the dunking mechanism. Make sure the bucket is stable on the frame and has plenty of room to dump water on the person sitting below it. The water will spill through the gap in the pipes on the frame. Connect the target to the tank with a pair of screws. Position the target so it is on the front side of the long pipe used to make the dunking mechanism. To attach it, use 2 strips of a metal plumber\u2019s tape. Screw \u20442 in (1.3 cm) galvanized screws through the holes in the tape or clamps. Position a screw on each end of the tape where it connects to the wood, then place another screw directly in the middle of the tape and through the pipe. Look for plumber\u2019s tape online or at a nearby hardware store. The screws will likely be available there too. Plumber\u2019s tape is very easy to use and it already has holes in it to help you position the screws. You could also use or 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) pipe clamps instead. Install screw eyes on the bucket and dumping mechanism. Drill a or \u20444 in (0.64 cm) pipe clamps hole through the top edge of the bucket near the valve you installed earlier. Make a second hole underneath the arm of the dumping mechanism that hangs over the bucket. Then, twist a \u20448 in (0.95 cm) eye screw clockwise into each hole. The screw eyes provide a spot to string the bucket to the dumping mechanism. They are basically screws with a circular opening on the end and are available at most hardware stores. Tie a string between the eye screws and the flapper. Run a length of string from the flapper to the eye screw on the PVC pipe. Knot it to the flapper, then route the string first to the eye screw on the bucket. Pass it through the bucket\u2019s screw before knotting it to the one on the PVC pipe. To ensure the string doesn\u2019t break, you could also use a heavy fishing line or another type of material. Try getting a fishing line online, at a general store, or at a fishing supply shop. Plug the hose into the adapter on the valve. Use a standard garden hose connected to a faucet near your home. To keep the hose in position, consider using plumber\u2019s tape to secure it to the dunk tape\u2019s frame. Once it is attached, you can turn on the water to start filling up the bucket! If you don\u2019t have a garden hose, you can get one at most general stores or hardware stores. Give the dunk tank a test by throwing some 1 lb (450 g) bean bags at the target. If it\u2019s set up correctly, the arm will pull up the flapper, causing water to spill onto anyone sitting inside the tank.",

    "Position the tees so the open end points toward the center of the dunk tank.",
    "This part will be used to make a platform for the bucket.",
    "Cement the remaining 30 in (76 cm) pipes between the tees.",
    "Place the pipes in the center of the frame.",
    "Run a pipe from a tee on the top part of the frame to one on the bottom.",
    "Make sure everything is flush and well-connected before you allow the PVC cement to dry.",
    "Adjust the pipes as needed before the cement dries.",
    "It makes them difficult to disconnect, so don\u2019t cement anything you plan on taking apart.",
    "Set the top frame onto the rest of the dunk tank to complete it.",
    "The top frame fits onto the cage like the bottom frame did.",
    "Use the 3-way corner joints to position the frame.",
    "The exposed openings in the joints fits right on top of the long pipes used for the body of the tank.",
    "You don\u2019t need to glue the frame to the long pipes.",
    "If you plan on taking apart the tank for storage, don\u2019t glue them.",
    "However, check the frame to make sure it\u2019s stable on top of the tank.",
    "Connecting the Target and Mechanism Place the bucket and dunking mechanism on top of the tank.",
    "Set the long pipe from the dunking mechanism into the tee on the top frame.",
    "Cement it in place to secure it.",
    "Next, position the bucket over the small pipes in the center of the frame.",
    "Rotate it so the flapper valve faces the overhanging pipe on the dunking mechanism.",
    "Make sure the bucket is stable on the frame and has plenty of room to dump water on the person sitting below it.",
    "The water will spill through the gap in the pipes on the frame.",
    "Connect the target to the tank with a pair of screws.",
    "Position the target so it is on the front side of the long pipe used to make the dunking mechanism.",
    "To attach it, use 2 strips of a metal plumber\u2019s tape.",
    "Screw \u20442 in (1.3 cm) galvanized screws through the holes in the tape or clamps.",
    "Position a screw on each end of the tape where it connects to the wood, then place another screw directly in the middle of the tape and through the pipe.",
    "Look for plumber\u2019s tape online or at a nearby hardware store.",
    "The screws will likely be available there too.",
    "Plumber\u2019s tape is very easy to use and it already has holes in it to help you position the screws.",
    "You could also use or 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) pipe clamps instead.",
    "Install screw eyes on the bucket and dumping mechanism.",
    "Drill a or \u20444 in (0.64 cm) pipe clamps hole through the top edge of the bucket near the valve you installed earlier.",
    "Make a second hole underneath the arm of the dumping mechanism that hangs over the bucket.",
    "Then, twist a \u20448 in (0.95 cm) eye screw clockwise into each hole.",
    "The screw eyes provide a spot to string the bucket to the dumping mechanism.",
    "They are basically screws with a circular opening on the end and are available at most hardware stores.",
    "Tie a string between the eye screws and the flapper.",
    "Run a length of string from the flapper to the eye screw on the PVC pipe.",
    "Knot it to the flapper, then route the string first to the eye screw on the bucket.",
    "Pass it through the bucket\u2019s screw before knotting it to the one on the PVC pipe.",
    "To ensure the string doesn\u2019t break, you could also use a heavy fishing line or another type of material.",
    "Try getting a fishing line online, at a general store, or at a fishing supply shop.",
    "Plug the hose into the adapter on the valve.",
    "Use a standard garden hose connected to a faucet near your home.",
    "To keep the hose in position, consider using plumber\u2019s tape to secure it to the dunk tape\u2019s frame.",
    "Once it is attached, you can turn on the water to start filling up the bucket!",
    "If you don\u2019t have a garden hose, you can get one at most general stores or hardware stores.",
    "Give the dunk tank a test by throwing some 1 lb (450 g) bean bags at the target.",
    "If it\u2019s set up correctly, the arm will pull up the flapper, causing water to spill onto anyone sitting inside the tank."
