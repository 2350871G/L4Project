  "text":" Picking Rootstock Plant apple trees that are known to grow well in your area. The rootstock must be hardy in your area. You can plant an apple tree from seedling to use as rootstock, but you will have to wait several years to create a sturdy plant. Rootstock must be suited to your climate and local insects. Opt to purchase rootstock in place of seedlings. Ask your local nursery about purchasing rootstock. This is the best way to ensure your type of rootstock is well suited to grafting. Discuss the varieties of scion that work well with the type of rootstock you buy when you purchase the stock from the nursery. Plant rootstock in pots until you are ready to use it. Keep it moist, in cool conditions through the winter. Although rootstock is sold when it is a few years old, it can be purchased just before you graft. Ensure your rootstock and scion will be compatible in diameter. The diameters of the branches have to match; however a graft with a thinner scion might be successful, as well. Buy several root stocks at once. Grafting success increases with practice, so you may need to cut several scion and rootstock branches before you are successful. Cutting Scions Cut scion branches in the fall or winter. You can store them until the next spring, when they will be ready to bud and plant. You want to have scion branches that are harvested above freezing but when the apple tree has already fallen dormant. Snip one year old branches from apple trees. Use sharp shears. Wash the shears with alcohol before harvesting different types of scions. Choose scion branches that have three or more buds and are one-quarter inch (0.6cm) thick.  Opt to purchase scions instead of harvesting them yourself. Nurseries or mail order services can send you scion branches to store until you are ready to graft. Moisten some sawdust or sphagnum moss. Place it in a large freezer bag. Add the scions to the plastic bag to store in the refrigerator until you are ready to graft. Open and spray the bag with water occasionally to ensure your scions do not dry out.  Bench Grafting Apple Trees Graft your apple trees early in the spring just before the buds of the rootstock tree are ready to open. This is often between April and May, but will depend greatly on your climate. Choose a rootstock that is one-fourth inch (0.6cm) thick. It should be the same size as your scion.

Wrap the conjoined area with floral tape or masking tape. Leave the end sticking out so that you don\u2019t need to cut through the grafted area to free it when the graft starts to grow. Paint the tape with parafilm or grafting wax.  Snip the scion above the top, third, bud at a 45-degree angle. Seal the top with wax as well. Label the scion immediately, so that you know what you have grafted.  Planting Grafted Trees Plant the rootstock in pots. Keep them in a cool, moist area. They can also be packed into sphagnum moss in a plastic bag and moistened until they are planted. Store them in a temperature between 36 and 42 degrees Fahrenheit (2.2 to 5.5 degrees Celsius). They will need to remain in this climate for two to four weeks. Plant your rootstock in a safe place where you can watch the trees carefully for signs of insects, deer or other damage.
