Serve the bread on a bread boat, a bread plate, or in a bread basket. Add a white linen doily to the basket to help keep the bread warm. Either slice the bread in advance or provide a bread knife so that guests can cut their own slices. If your loaf is crumbly, give your guests small bread plates for their soda bread slices.
