    "There are a few exceptions to this rule, as baby Pok\u00e9mon and Legendary Pok\u00e9mon (Articuno, Ho-Oh, Entei) cannot ever breed.",
    "There are a few other exceptions as well, as these Pok\u00e9mon cannot breed.",
    ":\nAny \"baby\" Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Nidorina and Nidoqueen.",
    "Cosplay Pikachu\nUnown Learn about different egg groups.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon do not have to be the exact same species in order to breed.",
    "There are several large categories, made up of similar Pok\u00e9mon, that are all able to interbreed.",
    "Two Pok\u00e9mon of the same egg group can breed as long as one is male and the other is female.",
    "These groups are complex and often overlapping, allowing trainers variety when breeding Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "A complete list of egg groups can be found here.",
    "When breeding two different species, the baby Pok\u00e9mon always will be the same species as the mother.",
    "But if a Ditto was used to make the egg, the baby will never be a Ditto.",
    "Egg groups are largely determined by appearance: there is a Plant Group, a Flying Group for birds, and a Human-Like Group for Pok\u00e9mon that walk on two legs.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon only need to share one egg group to be compatible.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon in the Undiscovered Egg Group cannot breed.",
    "Know that a Ditto can breed with almost any Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "The shape-shifting, genderless Pok\u00e9mon Ditto can be used to mate with Pok\u00e9mon from all egg groups excepting the Undiscovered and Ditto groups.",
    "Genderless Pok\u00e9mon, such as Magnemite or Golett, can only breed with a Ditto.",
    "The Pok\u00e9mon produced by Ditto breeding will always be the non-Ditto Pok\u00e9mon, whether you began with a male or female.",
    "Breeding with Ditto is a great way to breed male Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Obtaining an Egg Head to the game's Pok\u00e9mon Daycare.",
    "The Daycare is where you leave your Pok\u00e9mon to gain levels automatically.",
    "It is also a place to leave two compatible Pok\u00e9mon so that they have the privacy to begin egg-making.",
    "Find your game's Daycare and talk to the Old Man out front to begin breeding.",
    "In Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, it is to the left of Mauville.",
    "In FireRed/LeafGreen, it is on Route 5.",
    "In Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, it is in Solaceon town.",
    "In Heart Gold/Soul Silver, it is near the entrance to Goldenrod City.",
    "In Black/White it's on Route 3.",
    "In X/Y it's on Route 7.",
    "In Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire it is the same as the Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald games but there is also one in the battle resort\nIn Sun/Moon it is in Paniola Ranch.",
    "Place two compatible Pok\u00e9mon in the Daycare together.",
    "You need to leave one female and one male from the same egg group together in order to have a chance at breeding them.",
    "Again, the exception is with Ditto as it can breed with any egg group and any gender (besides the Undiscovered Egg Group).",
    "Put the two Pok\u00e9mon in your party and then talk to the Daycare staff to leave the Pok\u00e9mon at the Daycare.",
    "Understand the probabilities of getting an egg.",
    "The Original Trainer (OT) of the Pok\u00e9mon (whoever caught or bred it) and whether or not the Pok\u00e9mon are the same species, determines how quickly you will receive an egg.",
    "The fastest way to get an egg is to breed two Pok\u00e9mon of the same species with different OTs.",
    "This will give you a 70% chance of producing an egg every 256 steps.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon from different trainers have a higher probability of producing an egg.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon of the same species have a higher probability of producing an egg.",
    "You can attach the Oval Charm to any Pok\u00e9mon to increase its probability of breeding per 256 steps.",
    "Talk to the Daycare staff to determine how likely your Pok\u00e9mon are to breed.",
    "Chatting with the Old Man after placing your two Pok\u00e9mon in the Daycare will allow you to determine their egg production probability:\n\"The two seem to get along very well!\"",
    "indicates a high probability of an egg, around 70%.",
    "\"The two seem to get along\" indicates a 50% chance of an egg.",
    "\"The two don't really seem to like each other very much\" indicates a low chance of getting an egg, around 20%.",
    "\"They prefer to play with other Pok\u00e9mon more than with each other\" means you will never obtain an egg.",
    "This means they are incompatible to breed.",
    "In the Generation 2 games (Gold/Silver/Crystal) you must talk to the Pok\u00e9mon directly -- they will either \"care for each other\" (highly likely), \"be friendly\" (likely) or \"show interest\" (unlikely).",
    "Any other dialog means that they won't mate.",
    "Go out for a walk while the egg is being conceived.",
    "You need to give your Pok\u00e9mon time to breed.",
    "In all games after Generation 2, the game randomly chooses if you get an egg after you've taken 256 steps, based on the aforementioned probability.",
    "If you don't get one, you can keep walking to try again next time.",
    "It is often best to walk back and forth in front of or around the Daycare, allowing you to check on your egg periodically.",
    "You can ride your bike to make the steps melt away much faster.",
    "If you have a Pok\u00e9mon with Flame Body or Magma Armour abilities, the amount of time needed to get egg will be cut in half.",
    "In Generation 2 games, every step has the opportunity (though usually under 2%) to make an egg.",
    "Check in at the Daycare to see if your Pok\u00e9mon have an egg.",
    "You will need an open slot in your party to accept the egg, so don't go around with six Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "The Old Man will change his behavior if he has an egg to give you:\nIn Gold/Silver/Crystal, he will appear in the front yard.",
    "In Ruby/Saphire/Emerald, he will step out by the fence.",
    "In Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, he will face the road.",
    "In HeartGold and SoulSilver, he will face left or right instead of down and call the player over the Pok\u00e9gear.",
    "In Black/White he will call out to you.",
    "In X/Y he will face the road.",
    "In Alpha Sapphire / Omega Ruby he will turn around Wait for your egg to hatch.",
    "Eggs take anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 steps to hatch, so get back to your adventuring and wait to see what happens.",
    "To see the stage your egg is at, just go to your party and check the summary of your egg:\nThe first stage is \"I wonder what will hatch from this, it doesn't seem close to hatching.\"",
    "The second stage is \"It appears to move occasionally.\"",
    "The third stage is \"Sounds can be heard coming from the egg!\"",
    "The fourth and final stage is when the egg hatches.",
    "When you are walking, a text box will appear saying \"Oh!,\" and the egg will hatch similarly to an evolving Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Getting the Best Eggs Know that some Pok\u00e9mon need to hold incense to produce baby versions.",
    "A small handful of Pok\u00e9mon will actually produce a Pok\u00e9mon that is the second step up the evolutionary ladder if one of the parents is not holding a specific incense:\nSnorlax must have Full Incense to make Munchlax.",
    "Wobbuffet must have Lax Incense to make Wynaut.",
    "Roselia and Roserade must have Rose Incense to make Budew.",
    "Marill and Azumarill must have Sea Incense to make Azurill.",
    "Chimecho must have Pure Incense to make Chingling.",
    "Mr.",
    "Mime must have Odd Incense to make Mime Jr.\nChansey and Blissey must have Luck Incense to make Happiny.",
    "Mantine must have Wave Incense to make Mantyke.",
    "Know that baby will automatically learn the moves that both parents know.",
    "This is only applicable if the Pok\u00e9mon could eventually learn the move as they level up.",
    "If you breed a male and female Aggron who both have leveled up to learn Iron Tail, for example, the baby Aggron will know Iron Tail as soon as they hatch.",
    "This is a great way to pass down moves to young Pok\u00e9mon and make them powerful from an early age.",
    "Any TMs from the father will be passed to the child.",
    "A TM is an item that teaches a Pok\u00e9mon a move, but it can only be used once.",
    "However, if a baby Pok\u00e9mon is able to use a TM, they will learn the move automatically from their father when they are born.",
    "For example, you might have a male Charmeleon whom you taught Dig, but you cannot get another TM for Dig.",
    "If you breed the male Charmeleon with a female Pok\u00e9mon who could also learn Dig, the resulting baby would automatically know Dig from birth.",
    "This is a great way to \"reuse\" great TMs that you cannot get your hands on again.",
    "Generation VI, unfortunately, created some exceptions to this rule.",
    "Know that certain \"egg moves\" can be passed down from the mother in Generations VI or later.",
    "This new feature makes it easier to give great moves to you baby Pok\u00e9mon that they might not normally learn.",
    "For example, if you have a female Dragonite that knows Outrage and they mate with a Charizard, the resulting Dratini will know Outrage as well.",
    "Genderless Pok\u00e9mon cannot inherit egg moves.",
    "A exhaustive list of all known egg moves can be found online here.",
    "Try \"chain breeding\" to get specific moves from one Pok\u00e9mon to another.",
    "For instance, Eevee can only use Wish if it has learned it through a breeding chain.",
    "But Eevee cannot breed directly with any Pok\u00e9mon that can learn Wish -- you'll need an extra step.",
    "It is possible to breed a male Togekiss with Wish with a female Pikachu, then breed the resulting male baby Pikachu (with Wish) with a female Eevee, and voila -- a baby Eevee with Wish.",
    "This is a time-consuming process, but is essential to get the \"perfect\" move set for some trainers.",
    "Understand the concept of IV inheritance.",
    "IVs, or Individual Values, are hidden numbers between 0-31 that determine a Pok\u00e9mon's stats.",
    "They are Pok\u00e9mon's version of genes.",
    "Higher values determine how high your Pok\u00e9mon's maximum stats can be.",
    "When Pok\u00e9mon breed, each parent passes three of their IV's down to the baby and the rest are randomly selected.",
    "To get an idea of a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s IV, read the parents \"Nature.\"",
    "If they talk about quickness, the Pok\u00e9mon has a high Speed IV, if they talk about \"curiosity,\" they have a high Special Attack IV.",
    "However, this is not an exact science, as exact IVs are hidden from players.",
    "The item \"Destiny Link,\" when attached, passes five of the parent's IVs down instead of three.",
    "Attaching a \"Power\" object, like a belt or anklet, forces the parent to pass down the associated IV.",
    "So if you have a Power Weight on (grows HP), the parent's HP IV will be passed down.",
    "Advanced players can consult an IV predictor online to get estimations at their Pok\u00e9mon's IV scores and make breeding decisions."
