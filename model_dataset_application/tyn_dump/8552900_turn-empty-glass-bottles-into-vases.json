Use acrylic paint in a darker color to add shading between the designs, if desired. Embellish the bottle with rhinestones.

Choose a reverse stencil where it's just the solid shape; you can also make your own by cutting a simple shape out of contact paper. Place the stencil onto the bottle, then paint the entire bottle with spray paint. Let the paint dry, then remove the stencil.",
