Measure the width and length of your tiles and take a picture of them. Ask at the local tile shop if they have the same type. If not, try to find them online. To find out what material your tiles are, remove 1 from the grid. Knock on it and if there's a hollow sound it's wooden. You should be able to tell which tiles are metal and plastic from touching them. Mineral fiber or fiberglass tiles feel rougher on the surface but are light to hold."
