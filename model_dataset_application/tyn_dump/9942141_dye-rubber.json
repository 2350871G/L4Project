Check on the object's dyeing progress periodically, but avoid moving it to keep its new color even."

Grab the rubber object with tongs and dip it into the water continually until you reach your desired color, changing the tongs' position as you dip to make sure you thoroughly coat the object. If you choose this method, it should take up to 20-25 minutes depending on the brightness of the color. This method, while faster, can result in a more uneven color."

Inspect the object's new color and, if it's not as bright as you would prefer, repeat the process with a higher concentration of dye. Repeatedly dyeing the rubber over time may damage it. If you don't achieve the color you want after 1-2 times, try painting it instead."
