Some items such as large pieces may require a 'Brush Plating Kit', whereas other small items such as jewelry should be done with an \"Immersion Plating Kit\". An internet search of those terms will lead you to high quality equipment manufacturers. Most gold plated jewelry is made with a silver base, but other metals, such as copper or aluminum, can be gold plated as well. Silver and gold tend to diffuse into each other, which can cause a plated piece to become dull or tarnished looking as the gold plating wears. Layering the silver with copper first can create longer-lasting luster because it's not as reactive to gold."

If you\u2019re still not sure, try contacting a gold plating service or kit manufacturer about which kit is right for you to use. The average gold plating kit will include a liquid gold solution, an electrical supply, and a plating wand or brush that links to the power supply and directs where the gold is bonded. An all-inclusive kit is ideal; due to the nature of gold plating, you may need other solutions or accessories depending on what metal or item you are working on. Gold plating solutions regularly come in 14-karat, 18-karat, or 24-karat gold. The color of the finished product may vary depending on the karat levels.

Purchasing a start-up kit designed for gold plating is optimal. However, If your kit did not come with a source for the electrical current, do not worry because you can still set up your own. The process requires a DC power source, so you may need to purchase a rectifier in order to change an AC power source (such as a home outlet) to DC. The easiest solution is to purchase a variable power supply. For small home projects such as gold plating a coin or a pen, you can purchase an inexpensive variable power supply, which makes setting up your power source as easy as plugging it in, clipping your kit's plating brush to the positive output, and setting the voltage dial to your kit's specifications. For most kits, the current is going to be somewhere around three volts, though some may go as high as twelve volts."
