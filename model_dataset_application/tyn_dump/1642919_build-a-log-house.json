          "description":"Building a log cabin can be costly. The cost of the land, the cost of supplies and the cost of labor are all factors you will need to consider when estimating the cost of your new home. You have a number of options when it comes to financing your home, including savings, mortgage loans and construction loans. Talk to a mortgage broker to discuss which option works best for you. Mortgage loans. The most common type of loan is the closed-end, fixed-rate mortgage. These loans come on a variety of terms, but the most common is a 30-year term. Construction loans. This is a good option when it comes to building a log cabin. A construction loan acts like a credit line. You draw as you need and pay interest only on what you draw. You don\u2019t have to use it at all and can roll over or convert to a typical mortgage loan when the house is completed if you like. Savings. If you prefer not to take out a loan, you can pay your whole project with cash, provided you have enough. You will give up significant tax benefits and tie up your money at a reasonably poor return, but it can be done. How much should you borrow? The answer is plenty. Running out of money is the worst thing that can happen during construction. Despite your best budget estimates, it is impossible to know the exact cost of your log home until it has been built. What will the banks look for? Banks are essentially looking for two things. First, they want to know that the home will be sufficient collateral to secure the money they are loaning. This means they want to make sure the house will be built within the budget and will be a marketable house when it is finished. The second thing banks want to know is your ability to repay the loan. When the banks evaluate you, they look at three basic areas: credit, liquidity and income."

          "description":"It's important to do your homework before deciding what land to build your cabin on. Real estate agents and developers can help you to find a suitable lot. If you own land already, the first thing you need to do is make sure that it's suitable for building. Factors such as slope, soil conditions, accessibility, zoning and use of surrounding properties all play a part in determining whether a lot is suitable for building. You will need to contact local soil engineers and have them do a soil analysis. This will indicate whether water is readily available and if it's of good quality. Your potential building site will also need to pass a percolation test - which determines whether the land will soak up waste water from a septic system."

Keep in mind that the design and dimensions of your home will depend on the amount of money you are willing to spend and the quality of the materials you intend to use.

Factors such as whether you are planning on building the cabin yourself or hiring a team of professionals, will also significantly influence building time. Log homes are just as susceptible to delays, such as those caused by adverse weather conditions or poor workmanship, as any other building projects. Try to allocate some time to unforeseen delays in your schedule. Avoid deviating from your blueprints.

Choose your logs selectively, not cutting too many trees in the same space, the trees left behind will benefit from having more light and space to grow in.

    "A log cabin can be made from virtually any group of tall trees.",
    "However, a log cabin that lasts must be made from a narrow selection of wood types that have the characteristics needed to craft a sound, visually appealing structure that will retain its strength, value and appearance for decades and beyond.",
    "Common examples of trees types used in building log cabins include cypress, Douglas fir, white pine and yellow pine.",
    "If you are gathering the lumber yourself, choose trees that are of the length and diameter that will suit your needs.",
    "Think in terms of cutting a matched set of logs with the same mid-point diameter.",
    "House logs are best cut in winter, when the sap is down and the logs can be skidded over the snow with minimum damage to the logs and the environment.",
    "Choose your logs selectively, not cutting too many trees in the same space, the trees left behind will benefit from having more light and space to grow in.",
    "Alternatively, you can purchase lumber from a log home producer.",
    "It is possible to buy lumber precut, which minimizes and often eliminates the work you will have to do to prepare the logs.",
    "Prep the logs.",
    "Logs will need to be debarked and treated with a preservative treatment to prevent deterioration by insects, molds, mildew and fungus attacks.",
    "Consider whether you want to build your home with green logs (logs with a high moisture content) or dried logs.",
    "If you choose to use dried logs you will need to stack your freshly cut lumber to season.",
    "If you are happy to use green logs you will need to account for the lumber \"settling\" over the first few years.",
    "Building a Log House Alone: Construction Stage Lay the foundation.",
    "The foundation types for a log house are pretty much the the same as foundations for any structure of comparable size and weight.",
    "The difference comes in the weight of the walls, and the means of attaching the first round of logs to the foundation.",
    "Some of your options include:\n\nThe pier or stilt method.",
    "This is a popular and relatively inexpensive option, however the sub-floor will require extra insulation to keep your feet toasty in the winter.",
    "This type of foundation is also not as stable as some other options, which can be a downside if the log house is located in an area prone to storms or tornadoes.",
    "The pre-cast panel system.",
    "This is a newer type of foundation which is becoming increasingly popular due to its fast installation and the fact that it does not require a footing.",
    "The hollow foam block.",
    "This type of foundation consists of stacked, interlocking Styrofoam blocks.",
    "It can be built very quickly and is quite stable due to reinforcement bars which are placed between the blocks.",
    "Build the walls.",
    "Raising the cabin walls can be tricky.",
    "You must carefully align the logs so that they stack straight upwards.",
    "Since you are working with a natural material, some of the logs will be curved.",
    "The overall objective is to have the average center of all the logs bear down on the center line of the wall, which in turn bears on the centerline of the foundation.",
    "Install your doors and windows.",
    "Windows and doors in a log home should be located with consideration for solar aspect, prevailing winter winds, roof avalanche potential, and the structural elements of log construction.",
    "Face the majority of windows south for natural light and passive solar heat.",
    "Put the roof on.",
    "There are many ways to put a roof on your log creation to shelter it from the elements.",
    "The classic log house had a low-pitched roof with generous eave and gable end overhangs."
