          "description":"The three common oils used for waterproofing wood are linseed, walnut, and tung. Tung oil is typically found as a mix in most commercial products. Raw tung oil is often more expensive than other oils, so it is usually used on smaller wood projects. Walnut oil is the same product you\u2019ll find next to olive oil in the grocery store. Due to nut allergies, walnut oil cannot be used commercially. Linseed oil can be purchased at most DIY repair shops, but many of these products are sold as raw or boiled. Boiled linseed oil contains metal drying agents that are poisonous. You can still use this product on outdoor patio equipment, but you should not use it for anything involving food. Linseed oil can also be bought without metal drying agents. Seek out raw linseed oil if you want a safe coat on certain woods like your kitchen counter top."

Oil is good for smaller based wooden objects like a cutting board, table, counter top, or baseball bat. Make a list of surfaces you want to treat. This will help you know how much oil to purchase. A good thing about treating with oil is that the oil stays good for several years. Purchase the oil that best suits your treating needs. Purchase a large container of oil. It is better to have too much than too little."

Mix one part oil (tung, linseed, or walnut), one part turpentine oil, and \u00bd part apple cider vinegar. This mixture will preserve your oil supply and will create a more durable finish. Mix the ingredients in a metal container, like an empty coffee container. Mix the liquids until everything is blended. It isn\u2019t necessary to create a mixture, but many wood enthusiasts advise this type of concoction."

Use thick sandpaper or a metal file for any imperfections that are visible from the surface. Scrape with the sandpaper or file until the wood looks even. Finish by sanding the whole surface with fine grit (220) sandpaper. This will prep the surface to absorb the oil. Sweep the area or rub away any scraps with a dry cloth before applying the oil.

For example, you may find deck sealant, fence sealant, outdoor sealant, floor sealant or furniture sealant. Buy a marine wood sealant if your wood needs to stand up to humidity, UV rays and water.
