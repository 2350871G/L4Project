Creating Chocolate Banana Peanut Butter Fudge Line a baking dish. For the fudge, you\u2019ll need a 6-inch by 6-inch (15-cm by 15-cm) baking dish. Use a piece of parchment paper to line the dish so the fudge won\u2019t stick. If you prefer, you can line the dish with foil that\u2019s been lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.

Heat the mixture in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirring afterward. If it\u2019s not completely melted, continue heating in 15 second intervals until it is smooth. Be sure to mix the peanut butter and coconut oil after each interval in the microwave so you don\u2019t overheat them. Mix the peanut butter mixture with the banana. Once the peanut butter and coconut oil are melted, add 2 ripe, mashed bananas to the bowl. Stir the ingredients together well so they are completely combined. Because it has a thick consistency, it usually helps to use a fork to mix the banana into the peanut butter mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. When the banana and peanut butter mixture are combined, add 2 tablespoons (22 g) of chocolate chips to the bowl. Mix them into the other ingredients so they begin to melt and marble throughout the mixture. Milk, semisweet, and bittersweet chocolate chips will work in the fudge. Spread the fudge mixture into the baking dish. Once the chocolate chips are blended into the banana and peanut butter mixture, use a spatula to add the fudge to the prepared baking dish. Smooth the mixture to form an even layer. Press the fudge down in the dish to ensure that it is tightly compacted. Chill the fudge in the freezer until it is firm. When the fudge mixture is in the baking dish, cover it with a piece of plastic wrap. Place the dish in the freezer and chill it for at least 30 minutes, or until the fudge is firm. Slice the fudge into pieces. When the fudge is firm, remove it from the freezer. Use a knife to cut it into slices and serve. Store any leftover fudge in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
