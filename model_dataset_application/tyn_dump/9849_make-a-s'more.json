If you are working outdoors, make sure to follow safety precautions by having water or fire extinguisher near by, and to avoid windy days. If you are making a campfire, be sure to use clean, dry wood, and to properly rein in the fire with a ring of stones. Do not use accelerators. Break a graham cracker in half. You will end up with two square-shaped graham crackers. This will be enough to make one s'more. One of the halves will be for the bottom of the s'more, and the other half will be for the top.

Consider placing a paper towel on the plate beneath the graham cracker. It will absorb any moisture that forms and prevent your graham cracker from becoming soggy.

When making a fruity s'more, add the strawberry or banana slice on the graham cracker, before the chocolate. Consider using chocolate spread instead of hard chocolate.
