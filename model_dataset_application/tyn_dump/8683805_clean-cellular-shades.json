          "description":"Bugs may have crawled into the cells of your shade and died, accumulating there along with dust. Position the spray applicator of a can of compressed air at the mouth of a cell. Press the applicator and spray air through each cell to clear out bugs and dust. In some cases, this may cause dust and bugs to fly out the opposite end of the shade. You may want to lay down a drop cloth or newspaper to catch ejected matter and contain a potential mess. You can also spray the outer fabric of your shades with compressed air as a dusting measure. Spray each row/pleat of the fabric from top to bottom, end to end with the compressed air. If you don\u2019t have compressed air, you can use a blow dryer set to \u201cLow\u201d on \u201cCool.\u201d Avoid using hot air, which can cause the glue used to make the shade to weaken."

Follow the direction of the pleating to prevent the fabric from becoming deformed or misshapen. Use gentle, short strokes when wiping your shades with a cloth, duster, or lint roller. Take your time when wiping, dusting, or rolling the fabric. Too much force could deform its appearance. The microfiber cloth dry-wipe, feather dusting, and lint rolling are ideal cleaning measures for regular, light cleanup and dust reduction."

Tracks that are narrow may be difficult to clean inside. Use a narrow tool, like a screwdriver, to push your rag into the track to clean it. Cotton swabs are usually small enough to fit easily into side tracks. Dab the cotton end of the swab into warm water mixed with liquid dish soap, then clean the track.
