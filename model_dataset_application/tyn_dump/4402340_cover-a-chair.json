Mark each piece of material with its location and direction; for example, write \u201cback of chair\u201d on the fabric from the back of the chair, and put a \u201cT\u201d at the top of the piece and a \u201cB\u201d at the bottom of the piece. Some chairs, like dining room chairs, have removable seats that you can detach with a screwdriver. If this is the case for your chairs, go ahead and remove the seat entirely so it'll be easier to work with."

          "headline":"Replace the chair's batting and foam if they're in poor condition.",
          "description":"A chair generally has 4 layers: the base of the chair, a layer of foam, about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of batting, and the top layer of fabric. Depending on how old the chair is, the foam and/or batting may be stained, musty, or worn out. If this is the case, cut out matching sizes of new foam and/or batting. Set the foam in place on the chair seat; staple the batting in place around the edges. If you're reupholstering a relatively new chair from the last 10 or 15 years, you probably won't need to replace the foam or batting. For a chair older than that, the materials may have started to deteriorate and will need to be replaced."

          "headline":"Use the old fabric as a guide to cut out the new fabric for your chair.",
          "description":"Lay the new fabric down wrong-side up on a flat surface. Use the fabric you removed from the chair as a pattern to cut out the new pieces; just add about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) around the edges of each piece so you have ample room to staple the fabric into place later on. Don't forget to mark the new pieces of fabric so you know where they're supposed to go.Tip: Use sewing pins to hold the fabric in place while you're cutting out the new pieces."

          "description":"Line up the fabric for the top of the chair seat and pull it taut so it isn't baggy. Stick a few sewing pins along the edges to hold the material in place, and use a staple gun to attach the fabric to the chair around the bottom of the frame. Put a staple in every 2 inches (5.1 cm) around the entire perimeter of the chair. If the seat is round, create small pleats around the edges to make the fabric lay flat. To secure the corner, fold the material into a triangle so that it's flat against the seat and use 1 to 2 staples to pin it down."

Staple the material every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) around all its sides. When shopping for the dustcover material, look for a fray-resistant, upholstery-grade fabric. If you detached your chair seat from the frame, don't reattach it just yet."

Use a 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide swath of fabric and fold it over the piping (use the old piping from the chair or measure the same amount of piping from new material if needed). Fold the fabric over the piping (keep the pattern on the outside) and sew along the edge of the piping with a straight stitch to enclose it. If your chair back doesn't have fabric on both sides, you can skip this step. In that case, treat it the same as the chair seat and secure the fabric to the back of the base with the staple gun."

Fold back the top edge of the fabric and place the piping down along the edges (position the seam of the piping so it's facing outwards). Replace the top piece of fabric, then pin along the edges of the material. Make sure you pin the pieces in place properly. It would be frustrating to accidentally have something upside down or inside out."

Do your best to sew as close to the piping as possible so that it's tight and won't wriggle around once it's on the chair. If there is a lot of excess fabric around the edges, go ahead and trim it off so it doesn't make your seam look bulky."
