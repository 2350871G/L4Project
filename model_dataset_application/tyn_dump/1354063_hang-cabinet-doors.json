          "description":"If you took the hinges off of the door at the start, then you should be able to find the original screw holes. Line the hinges up with those holes and use a hand drive screwdriver to attach them. New doors may or may not have pre-drilled holes for the hinges, so install them 2 in (5.1 cm) from the top and the bottom of the door to ensure they support the door properly. When working with new doors that have never had hinges attached, carefully use a power drill to drill holes for the screws. Make the holes very shallow so you don't drill through the front of the door. Look for a mark of some kind, or read the instructions that came with the cabinets, to determine where the hinges need to go. If you are working with hinges that stay together as one piece,  attach them to the door before you attach them to the cabinet. Some hinges will come into two pieces and you'll attach one to the door and one to the cabinet itself."

Most doors should overlap the opening by \u20444 inch (1.9 cm), but the type of door and the type of hinges determines the best way to attach it. If the inside of the door is flat, it is probably an overlay door. If there is a ridge on the inside of the door that would rest inside the cabinet, it is a partial inset door. You can hold the door up against the cabinet to see how it fits. For a partial inset door, move it around to see it if fits tightly in the cabinet opening or if there is room to move it around. This will affect how you position it when you hang it. The type of door you have will determine where the hinges go, to an extent. Some hinges will attach to the face of the cabinet, while others will attach inside the cabinet."

If you can't find holes anywhere, and you don't have instructions, you'll have to do a little bit of guesswork to determine exactly where the hinges attach. With doors that inset, there is a pretty small margin of error for where you could place the hinges. With overlay doors, your goal is to center the door on the cabinet opening."

You want roughly half of the tape to be covered by the door and half of the tape to be visible. Make this tape line as level as you can. You can use a level to guide as you stretch it out. Use a level to mark a line for the second cabinet door. Holding the level against the bottom of the first cabinet door, draw a line under the opening for the second door. This line will give you the proper angle to match the second door up to the first door. Hang the second door. Follow all of the steps from the previous section to hang the second door. Align the bottom of the door with the mark you made along the tape guideline. Once the door is up, place the level along the bottom of both doors to ensure they are aligned. Repeat this process for the remaining doors. As you move down the line of cabinets, you can draw a level guideline for each cabinet door.
