This will keep the fabric from fraying past the fringe. If you want to have a fringe on all four sides, sew around the blanket using a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance. Turn the fabric at the corners so that you sew in one continuous line. If you want a longer fringe, leave a larger seam allowance."

The easiest way to do this would be to grab a thread or two with a seam ripper and then pulling it out. Keep doing this until you reach the stitching you made. Be sure to pull the threads out from the notch you cut into the selvage edge. Do not fray the rest of the selvage. Run your fingers through the fringe when you are done.
