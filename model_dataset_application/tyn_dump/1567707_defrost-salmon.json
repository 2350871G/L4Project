Squeeze out any air bubbles so that the sides of the fish are pressed against the inside of the bag. Then seal it up tightly.

The fish should be fully submerged when the bowl is filled with water. Use 2 or more resealable plastic bags and 2 or more bowls if you\u2019re defrosting a larger quantity of salmon."

Once you reach the right temperature, pour enough water into the bowl to completely cover up all parts of the frozen fish. Use a sealed can or jar to weigh down the fish if it floats to the top; aim to keep all of the salmon underwater. Refrain from using warm water. If you warm up the outsides of the salmon, the fish will quickly lose its moisture and flavor. Plus, the insides won\u2019t be properly defrosted."

You\u2019ll need to weigh down the salmon with a sealed jar or can as it\u2019s more likely to float to the top this way. Or, if you don\u2019t want to use running water, just tip out and refill the cold water ever 10 to 20 minutes.

Refrain from leaving it in the fridge or refreezing it. This method doesn\u2019t work well for whole fish, as they won\u2019t fit in a resealable gallon bag and are typically too thick to thaw completely underwater. Instead, try defrosting a whole salmon in the fridge overnight. If any ice crystals remain in the inside cavities of a whole salmon, seal the fish in plastic wrap and run cold water over the frozen parts for up to 1 hour."
