    "Brush the pastry strips and baking sheet squares with the beaten egg.",
    "Dip a basting brush into the beaten egg and spread a thin layer over the pastry strips and baking sheet squares.",
    "The egg will give the pastry a golden color and make it cook correctly.",
    "Egg alternatives, such as flaxseed mix, will also work to cook it correctly, but the flavor might not be quite the same.",
    "Put the pastry strips upright on each side of the squares, then bake for 15 minutes.",
    "Place the pastry strips on their long sides on each side of the squares you cut earlier, so they surround and encapsulate a smaller area in the middle.",
    "They should rise 2 cm (0.79 in) above the squares you cut earlier, creating a pocket in the middle of the pastry.",
    "Press the pastry squares and the strips together at the base to make them stick together and hold up in the oven.",
    "Then, bake the pastries for 15 minutes at 200 \u00b0C (392 \u00b0F).",
    "Keep an eye out for the pastry to rise and poke any bubbles with a fork to let out steam and allow it to cook properly.",
    "Remove the baked pastries after 15 minutes or as soon as they become golden-brown.",
    "Prepare custard mix and combine it with orange liqueur.",
    "Prepare 1  c (240 ml) of the custard mix according to the instructions on the box, then add it to a bowl and pour 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of orange liqueur over it.",
    "This adds a slight citrus flavor to the mix, and feel free to add a little more if it is too subtle for your taste.",
    "Most custard requires \u20444  c (59 ml) of milk and a pot to heat up the mixture in.",
    "Check the instructions for your mix to find out the exact requirements.",
    "Use orange zest to taste or 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of orange juice instead if you do not want to consume alcohol.",
    "Spoon the custard mix into the center of each pastry, then add kiwi berries.",
    "After removing the pastries, let them cool for a few minutes, then carefully fill the center with the custard and orange liqueur mix.",
    "The only thing left to do after that is to cut the kiwi berries in half and balance them on top of the custard!",
    "Serve the pastries warm or keep them in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days."
