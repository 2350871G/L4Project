          "description":"If the wood is unfinished, which means it is its original color, then you'll simply prepare the wood and add stain. If it is already stained you have a decision to make -- either stain over the old color or remove the stain and start over. If there is a finish on the furniture (a clear coat that protects the wood), you must remove this before starting. If you're adding a darker stain to a lighter piece, you can generally add this new stain over the old one without having to remove the original color."

          "description":"Stain can change the color of metal handles, knobs, and hinges permanently. They are best removed before beginning. If the metal cannot be removed then use painter's tape to carefully cover it all up. Plastic, glass, or rubber should be similarly removed to prevent accidental discoloration."

          "headline":"Breakdown larger furniture into smaller pieces if possible.",
          "description":"To get the most even and total coverage you should stain each part of the furniture individually. This prevents missing areas around joints or corners as well as stain pooling up along edges or in cracks. While not strictly necessary, this step will ensure the most professional finish."

        {
          "headline":"Sand the whole piece with medium-grit (100-120) sandpaper.",
          "description":"Work in the direction of the grains to avoid making scratches. This means that you sand parallel to the lines in the wood, not against them. If the piece is large you can use an orbital sander with 120 grit paper to work more quickly. If the furniture is very worn, go at it with a coarser sandpaper (80 grit or so) until you have it nice and smooth. You can then move to the medium-grit paper. The lower the number on the sandpaper, the coarser (rougher) the grit."

        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a finer-grit sandpaper, around 220 grit, to smooth and polish the surface.",
          "description":"Sanding opens up microscopic pores in the wood. The stain can then soak into these holes, changing its color permanently. For very delicate pieces, work up to 220 grit slowly. Go from 150 to 180, then 200, then 220 or higher for a perfect surface. If the furniture is already stained and the color is still there after sanding, you will either need to continue sanding with a coarse-grit paper or use a chemical stripping agent to remove the old color"

The alternative is a chemical stripper which, though messy, will remove the majority of coloring. To use one, purchase a stripper labeled \"wash away\" or \"no cleanup,\" then move your furniture to a well-ventilated area:\nPut on gloves and eye protection. Apply a thick coat of chemical stripper on the entirety of the wood. Let the stripper sit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

    "Check the stain's instructions to see if you need to wait even longer, though most stains will be dry within half a day or less.",
    "Try to place the wood in a well-ventilated area to speed up the process and prevent fumes from collecting.",
    "Finishing the Job Apply a second coat of stain after the first has dried for a darker color.",
    "This second coat generally doesn't need to be left on for long.",
    "Simply apply it just like the first coat, wiping off after 2-3 minutes.",
    "Let it all dry for another 6-8 hours before moving on.",
    "Do not add this second coat until the first has finished drying.",
    "Finish the furniture after you're done sanding to protect it.",
    "Stain is for looks, but it will not protect the wood from moisture, oils, or warping.",
    "For that you will need to finish the final piece, protecting both the wood and your stain.",
    "You can choose from the following options:\nWater-based polyurethane\nPolyurethane\nWood lacquer\nFinishing oils Use a water-based polyurethane for a safe and easy finish.",
    "Using a clean cloth or foam brush, simply apply a thin, even coat of polyurethane to the wood, then let it dry.",
    "Don't worry if it looks milky or white as you apply it -- it will dry clear.",
    "Water-based polyurethane is, by far, the easiest finish to apply, though it is less protective of water or oil than other finishes.",
    "Use a traditional polyurethane for a strong, protective coating.",
    "Apply 2-3 thin coats, making sure there are no bubbles on each one.",
    "Let each coat dry, then sand it with 220 grit paper before applying the next one.",
    "This is the thicker, almost plastic-like clear coating on many tables and desks.",
    "If your furniture is going to be prone to nicks, scratches, and scuffs, this is your best bet for protection.",
    "Try out a wood lacquer for a gorgeous, soft finish on high-end furniture.",
    "To apply it, use a paint sprayer and aim for an even coat throughout.",
    "A natural-bristle brush can also be used, but you must work quickly, as lacquer dries quickly.",
    "Let it dry, using a brush to remove any bubbles or unevenness, then sand with fine-grit (220 or higher) paper.",
    "Apply 2-3 more coats, sanding between each one.",
    "Lacquer is harder to apply but worth the effort for expensive pieces.",
    "Apply a penetrating oil, like tung, Danish, or antique oil, for a light and beautiful finish.",
    "Apply a little bit of oil to a clean rag and rub it into the dry, stained wood.",
    "Let it soak according to the oil's instructions, then rub it off with a clean rag and apply 1-2 more coats.",
    "If the piece is subject to lots of wear and tear, this is not a very protective coating.",
    "You should use something more durable."
