          "description":"Turn your oven on to 450 F (232 C) and let it preheat while you prepare the biscuits. Place about 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter into a glass bowl. Place the bowl on top of the oven so the butter will warm and melt over the heat from the oven. Use a glass or metal bowl for the butter, as this will conduct heat better and allow the butter to melt. Also, a plastic bowl might melt from the heat of the oven. Melt the butter in the microwave or in a pot on the stove if your oven top doesn't get hot enough to melt it."

Tap the side of the sifter with your hand to sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. This will remove lumps and help incorporate the three ingredients. To make your own self-rising flour, combine 5 cups (625 g) of all-purpose flour, 7\u00bd teaspoons (30 g) of baking powder, and 1\u00bc teaspoons (7.5 g) of salt."

Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Stop as soon as the dough starts to come together. The biscuit dough will be sticky, but resist the urge to keep stirring. Overmixing will develop the gluten and make for dense and chewy biscuits."

Fold the left side of the dough into the center, and then the right side of the dough on top of that. Starting from the top, roll the dough into a pinwheel and shape it into a ball. Flatten out the dough with your hands and repeat these same folding steps a second time. Folding the dough in this way will fully incorporate all the ingredients without overmixing the dough.
