The suit rankings from lowest to highest: spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts. Remove any jokers from the deck before you start the game. In Tien Len, the 2 of hearts will always outrank the 2 of any other suit. The numerical value always comes before the suit value, so an 8 of spades will always be higher than a 7 of hearts. The suit value is only used to determine the highest card if the same numerical-value cards are played. For example, if two 7s are played, the 7 with the highest suit value trumps the other 7."

To begin the game, use one of these legal combinations in conjunction with the 3 of spades:\nSolo: 1 card. For example, you could simply play the 3 of spades on its own. In other subsequent hands, you can play a solo card of any value. Doubles: 2 cards of the same value, like 2 3s. Triples: 3 cards of the same value, like 3 3s. Quads: 4 cards of the same value, like 4 3s. Runs: this is also called a straight; it consists of 3 or more cards that run in sequence. These cards don\u2019t have to match suit. Runs cannot contain 2s. For example, you could play the 3 of spades, 4 of hearts, and 5 of spades. Double runs: 2 sets of 3 or more cards that have the same straight-number sequence. The cards don\u2019t have to match in suit and the runs cannot contain 2s. For example, 3 of spades, 3 of hearts, 4 of clubs, 4 of spades, 5 of hearts, and 5 of diamonds would be a double run.Tip: In some variations of the game, you can win automatically if you have all 4 deuces.

    "For example, if a solo 2 is beaten by 4 5s, the next player will need to play a quad combination with a card value that is higher than 5.",
    "Lay down a 4-card double run to beat a pair of 2s.",
    "A 4-card double run will consist of 8 cards in total.",
    "For example, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, and 9 would be a 4-card double run.",
    "Remember, the suits do not have to match when you play runs.",
    "A 4-card double run can also beat any quad combination or 3-card double run.",
    "Play a 5-card double run to beat 3 2s.",
    "The only way to beat 3 2s is to use 10 cards to play 2 5-card runs, like 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, and 7.",
    "The suits do not matter, but the numbers have to match up from one run to another.",
    "There is no way to beat 4 2s.",
    "Having 4 2s automatically wins the game for the player they belong to.",
    "Trump a 3-card double run with a quad combination.",
    "For example, if someone plays a double run consisting of any arrangement of cards, you could play 4 3s and beat their combination.",
    "Your quad combination can hold any value and still beat the 3-card double run.",
    "The quad combination will then be what the next player has to beat on their turn to keep the hand going.",
    "Ending the Game Begin the next hand if you played the last laid highest combination.",
    "The person who laid the combination that trumped everyone else\u2019s cards gets to lead the next round.",
    "That person leads by laying down another legal combination, and thus the game continues.Tip: At any point during the game, you can ask your opponents how many cards they have left in their hands.",
    "Each player has to give you a truthful answer.",
    "Lay down your final legal combination to \u201cwin\u201d the game.",
    "The first person to completely empty their hand of all their cards is the official winner.",
    "If you want, though, the remaining players can continue to play to determine who comes in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places.",
    "Part of the fun of Tien Len is that no scoring is required, so literally all you need to play the game is a deck of cards and some friends.",
    "In some variations of the game, the winner of a hand of Tien Len will lead the next game, rather than the person who has the 3 of spades.",
    "Win immediately if your hand contains an \u201cauto win\u201d sequence.",
    "These are optional variations to the game, so decide with your friends beforehand if you want to honor any of them.",
    "If you decide you want to do so, check your hand when it\u2019s first dealt to see if you are an automatic winner:\n4 deuces\n6 sets of doubles\nDragon series, meaning you have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, ace, 2.",
    "The suits don\u2019t have to match.",
    "13 red or black cards.",
    "Play for money to turn Tien Len into a betting game.",
    "In many variations of Tien Len, it\u2019s common for the players to bet real money on whether or not they will be the ultimate loser of the game.",
    "Instead of the winnings going to the first person who lays down all their cards, the last person holding cards has to pay out a specified amount of money to the other 3 players.",
    "Or, you could also play a variation where the 3rd and 4th place players pay money to the 1st and 2nd place players, making sure that the 1st place player always wins the most money.",
    "For example, if the agreed-upon bet is $25, at the end of the game the loser will pay each individual player $25, for a total of $75 lost.",
    "You could get creative with the betting and do something like the loser has to buy everyone a round of drinks or has to pay for pizza to be delivered.",
    "Make it fun and feel free to think outside the box!",
    "In some variations, the 3rd and 4th place players have to give their 2 highest-ranking cards to the 1st and 2nd place players in the next game."
