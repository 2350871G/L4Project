Discard the brine after you've taken the turkey out of the pot. There's no need to fill the brined turkey's cavity with flavorings, but you could rub a little butter on the turkey's skin to help it stay moist."

The legs should be close to you and the neck area should be farthest from you. Kitchen twine is made of cotton or linen and it's food safe. Hook the twine around the turkey's neck and bring the twine to the legs. Pull about 3 feet (91 cm) of twine from the spool and cut it.

Keep them crossed and pull them up near the wings. As you pull, the twine will bring the turkey legs together so they're touching.

The twine won't come undone as you turn the turkey over because you've already tied a knot near the turkey legs. Turn the turkey over and tie another knot near the legs.
