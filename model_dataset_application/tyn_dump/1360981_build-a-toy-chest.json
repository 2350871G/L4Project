You can get different types of solid wood, plywood, or MDF at a lumber yard or home improvement center. MDF stands for medium-density fibreboard. It is a bit denser than plywood and has a smoother surface, but is not as strong as plywood and can sag under heavy weight. Plywood is slightly more expensive, but is stronger than MDF."
