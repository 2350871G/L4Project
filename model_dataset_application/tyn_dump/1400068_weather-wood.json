          "description":"Using different kinds of vinegar when weathering will give the appearance of your wood a different look. White distilled vinegar will give you more of a brown color in your wood, apple cider vinegar will impart more of a bluish-gray, and balsamic vinegar will have more of a green tint. Depending on the wood you are using, the intensity of your vinegar weathering may vary. Differences in wood composition will influence the end result. These kinds of vinegar are generally inexpensive and can be found at most grocery stores. You don't need a fancy brand for great results, even generic kinds of vinegar should work well for weathering."

          "description":"In your bowl or container, pour enough vinegar to coat the entire surface of the wood you are weathering. Since vinegar is a relatively thin liquid and spreads easily, 1 - 2 cups should be enough. Then place a piece of steel wool into the solution. Generally, the longer you allow your vinegar and steel wool to sit, the more intense the weathering effect will be. You may want to use a fine steel wool, like 0000 steel wool, as this will dissolve more easily in your vinegar solution and decrease the wait time. At about the 15 minute mark, your steel wool will start dissolving into the solution. This will create a lighter weathering effect. Longer wait times will produce a darker result. Adding a second piece of steel wool to the mix can speed the process along, as there will be more steel available for the vinegar to break down."

Instant coffee, however, reacts more easily to water, and will likely have the most pronounced effect. A tablespoon of grounds in your solution should be sufficient, if you wish to darken the effect of your weathering. You can modify the amount of coffee used in your solution. Less coffee will result in more subtle brown tones, while more will give a more dramatic color."

When dipping, you should keep your fingers out of the solution. Use a pair of pliers, tongs, or a plastic glove to prevent skin contact. The more coats of solution you apply, the more weathered the wood will appear. For most projects, dipping once or twice for a minute or two will be sufficient. When applying with a paintbrush, one or two coats should be enough. Err on the side of caution when applying your weathering solution.

If you're in a rush and can't wait for your wood to air dry, you can use a hair dryer to speed up this process.

A good starting point, however, is 1 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Mix your baking soda and water thoroughly before applying the solution. If the baking soda isn't equally distributed, parts of your wood could look more weathered than others. Baking soda has a chemical reaction with a substance in the wood known as \"tannins.\" Wood high in tannins, like mahogany, oak, and walnut, will react more intensely with this solution. Generally, hardwoods have a higher tannin content than softwoods. If you notice natural yellow, red, or brown tinting in the wood, this could be a strong indication of tannins. Since wood with a higher tannin content reacts stronger than lower tannin wood, you may want to decrease the amount of baking soda when weathering high tannin wood."

If after the wood dries it is not weathered to the point you desire, you can add another layer of solution.

You can do the same by adding small, irregularly shaped rocks and pebbles to the surface of your wood and scrubbing it with your wire brush or stepping on the stones to scrape the stones against wood. The key to this technique is trapping the stones between your brush or foot before applying pressure. As the rocks rub against or are ground into the wood, it will break down and look more weathered. Exercise care when trying to grind stones into your wood with your feet. You can very easily lose balance and injure yourself.

With a tool, like a woodworking knife, a screwdriver, or a chisel, you can add notches and small cuts to give more character to the wood. However, the cuts you make may appear unnatural. In this case:\nUse sandpaper to soften the sharp edges of your cuts to make them look more natural. Hardwoods may require a coarser grain of sandpaper for you to sand effectively. Use your wire bristle brush to make your tool weathering appear less intentional. Even a few passes with your brush can have a significant effect."

    "The stiffer the bristles of your brush, the more it will break down the wood as you scrub.",
    "Use strong, firm pressure for the best results.",
    "Depending on the kind of wood you are using, this process might take a day or more of hard scrubbing before the effects are apparent.",
    "Erode the wood with rocks.",
    "Rocks, stones, and other airborne particles naturally wear wood down over time.",
    "You can do the same by adding small, irregularly shaped rocks and pebbles to the surface of your wood and scrubbing it with your wire brush or stepping on the stones to scrape the stones against wood.",
    "The key to this technique is trapping the stones between your brush or foot before applying pressure.",
    "As the rocks rub against or are ground into the wood, it will break down and look more weathered.",
    "Exercise care when trying to grind stones into your wood with your feet.",
    "You can very easily lose balance and injure yourself.",
    "You may be able to erode a larger area of your wood at a time by sandwiching rocks between two boards and standing on the top board.",
    "Use a tool to etch the wood.",
    "This technique allows for the most intentional weathering.",
    "With a tool, like a woodworking knife, a screwdriver, or a chisel, you can add notches and small cuts to give more character to the wood.",
    "However, the cuts you make may appear unnatural.",
    "In this case:\nUse sandpaper to soften the sharp edges of your cuts to make them look more natural.",
    "Hardwoods may require a coarser grain of sandpaper for you to sand effectively.",
    "Use your wire bristle brush to make your tool weathering appear less intentional.",
    "Even a few passes with your brush can have a significant effect."
