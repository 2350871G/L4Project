Hang your clothes by a window (or outside) if there's a breeze, or set up a fan to simulate the airflow inside the house.

  "text":" Wringing Out Excess Water Use a high-spin wash. If you're using a washing machine, you can prime your clothes to dry more quickly. Use a high spin setting on your washing machine to remove as much water as possible from your clothes before you even take them from the wash.
