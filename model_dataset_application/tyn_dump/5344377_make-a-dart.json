Note that a quarter is just a little under 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, so the circular spot you heat should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm). It might be easier to do this if the milk jug is on its side instead of standing upright."

          "headline":"Cut out the dimpled section.",
          "description":"Use scissors or a sharp knife to carefully cut away the side of the jug with the dimpled cone on it. If you plan to make several darts, you should make several of these cones in the same manner before you cut out the wall of plastic. Make sure that you leave a little space in between each cone as you form them."

This may not be necessary if you can find a piece of metallic tubing that already has a sharp end. For ease of use, the tube should only be between 4 and 12 inches (10 and 30 cm) long."

While a variety of wooden shafts would work well for the dart, standard bamboo skewers are the easiest to use. The wood is sturdy enough and the thickness of the skewer is just the right size."

The string should be roughly the same thickness as floss. Linen string, kite string, and yucca fiber are all good options. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of string hanging out from one side of the split.

You will probably need to insert cotton fibers beneath the string as it winds around the skewer. Do this using your non-dominant hand and work with a few fibers at a time. Continue until there are 2 inches (5 cm) of cotton fletching wrapped around the dart. The winding process takes time and practice to master, so don't be discouraged if you don't get it right the first time."

    "Adhere six perler beads to the nail.",
    "Apply a thin dot of super glue to the cone side of the nail, then slide a total of six perler beads onto the nail and into the glue.",
    "The perler beads add weight to the dart.",
    "This weight can make the darts more stable, which improves their ability to fly.",
    "These beads should be fitted next to the cone and along the middle of the nail so that they remain visible.",
    "Alternate back and forth between applying glue and slipping beads on.",
    "If you have difficulty getting the beads on using your fingers, you may need to slide them on using pliers.",
    "Let dry before use.",
    "Allow the glue to dry completely.",
    "Once it dries, the dart is ready to throw."
