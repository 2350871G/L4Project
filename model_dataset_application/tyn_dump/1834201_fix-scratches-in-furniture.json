Dampen a soft, clean cloth with the soap solution and use it to remove dust, dirt, grime, and leftover polish from the area around the scratch. After cleaning, wipe up any standing water and allow the surface to air dry completely. A microfiber or terry cloth towel will be perfect for cleaning wood furniture.

There, you\u2019ll find furniture touch-up markers in a wide variety of colors. Pick out a shade that most closely resembles the tone of the damaged wood. If you\u2019re not sure which color to go with, consider getting more than one. That way, you\u2019ll have a better chance of finding a good match and spare yourself a second trip. Some furniture stores may also carry touch-up markers for DIY home repairs.Tip: Snap a clear, well-lit picture of the scratched piece and take it to the store with you.

It can help to move the marker in multiple directions from several different angles. Allow the ink to soak into the exposed wood for at least 20-30 seconds before moving on to the next step. Be careful not to spread the ink to any part of the surrounding finish.
