Steel framed multistory buildings may require welded handrail posts, while wood framed construction would require wood posts, or metal posts with fastening flanges installed on them. Decide what the load capacity of your system should be. Government agencies in the United States like OSHA (and similar agencies in other countries) set standards for fall protection.

Consider alternate methods for projects where conventional handrails built with cables and steel posts, or wooden rails on metal or wood posts are not practical. Safety nets systems, warning lines, safety harnesses, and safety spotters may be used in some jurisdictions under some conditions; you'll need to check the relevant regulations and requirements for your location. Design your handrail system with the existing conditions in mind. For the handrail system shown in the illustrations, a steel angle surrounds the perimeter of the second floor work area, so steel tubing with cables and angle iron bracing is used. The cables are attached to structural columns to anchor the cable handrails. Estimate the amount of materials you need. Typical handrail post spacing lay on 8 foot (2.4 meters) centers, so you will need one post per eight feet (2.4 meters) of protected length. You may need two cables or rails, so you can figure double the outside perimeter length for this material. Also, consider whether a toe-board is needed to protect people working below the edge of the elevated platform from falling objects. Lay out the location for the handrail posts, then, using a safe access method, install them. Using an aerial lift can make this step easier. Otherwise, access the platform by other means, using a safety harness and related fall protection devices to protect the installer. Fasten the posts around all edges requiring protection. Keep them as plumb as possible, and make sure the means you use for attachment will hold the required load. Attach the handrail system to the structural members of the building where possible to increase its strength. This will also reduce the number of handrail posts you will need for the job.
