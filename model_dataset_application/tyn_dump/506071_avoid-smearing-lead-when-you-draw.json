Be mindful, and watch how your drawing is developing, and try not to rest the heel of your hand on parts that you have already drawn on. Any oils from your hand can make smudges permanent. Any loose particle of graphite will get caught in that oil and deposit itself on your nice white surface. Watch what you're doing."

      "description":"You will need a white plastic eraser - if you're doing a lot of fine details, get one of the \"pen-type\" ones that you can just click to feed more eraser out. Also, get a kneaded eraser - this is a special type of putty that picks up graphite, and which can be formed with your fingers into just the right shapes. You may also want to look into an electric eraser - these are capable of the greatest detail. You can also get what's called 'cleaning powder.\" It's really just a bag full of eraser crumbs, but if you smear a lot, it can help clean up your drawings quite a lot."

      "headline":"Use a mahl stick or a drawbridge.",
      "description":"If you're working on a large picture, sometimes you just have to put your hand somewhere. Luckily, there are a couple of tools specifically made for this problem. The first, a mahl stick, is nothing more than a length of doweling with a non-mar rubber tip. Holding the stick in your non-drawing hand, put the rubber tip on the desk or the paper, out of the area where you are working. Now put a pencil or a paperback book at the other end of the stick, where you are holding it. Continue to hold onto the mahl stick so that you can move it with your drawing hand. Rest the heel of your drawing hand on the stick rather than on your drawing, and draw. It keeps your hand up off the picture. A drawbridge is similar - it's usually a piece of clear acrylic about 4\"x12\", with rubber feet on the bottom. Put the drawbridge on the drawing, where your drawing hand needs to rest, and use it to rest your hand on, instead of laying your hand directly on the drawing."
