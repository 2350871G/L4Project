  "text":" Make the Dough Place the pecans in a food processor fitted with a steel blade and coarsely chop them. Then add the confectioner\u2019s sugar to the food processor bowl and continue processing until the pecans are finely ground but not smooth. Combine the flour, the pinch of salt and the baking soda in a large mixing bowl using a flat plastic spatula or wooden spoon.  Add the butter chunks to the flour mix.  Add the shortening, 1 teaspoon at a time, until you have added all of it to the flour mixture.  Mix the flour mixture together with your clean hands to combine the butter and shortening with the dry ingredients.  Continue working in the butter and shortening until the dough resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the pecan and sugar mixture and incorporate it into the dough with your hands.  Add the egg, working it into the dough with your hands. Knead the dough until it just becomes soft enough to roll into a ball, but do not overwork the dough. Prepare and Bake the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Scoop some of the cookie dough into your hands and form it into a ball that is about 1-1/2\" (4 centimeters) wide. Again, be sure not to overwork the dough. Place the dough ball onto the cookie sheet. Add additional dough balls, leaving about 1\" (2.5 centimeters) of space between each cookie. Bake the cookies for 7 minutes and then rotate the baking sheet 90 degrees so that the cookies brown evenly.  Continue baking the cookies for another 7 minutes or until they are golden brown.  Take the cookies out of the oven and allow them to cool on the stove top for 2 minutes.  Place wax paper underneath a wire cooling rack. This will help you to catch any excess confectioner\u2019s sugar. Using a spatula, loosen the cookies from the parchment paper and place them on the wire rack.  Place some confectioners sugar in a sieve.  Dust the cookies with confectioner\u2019s sugar by tapping the sieve and moving it above the surface of the cookies, allowing the sifted sugar to fall through the mesh and onto the cookies.  Finished. ",
