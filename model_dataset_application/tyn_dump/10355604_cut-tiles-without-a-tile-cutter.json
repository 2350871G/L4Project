If you don\u2019t have a tile marker, a lead pencil or crayon will work, too. For a dark piece of tile, lay a strip of masking tape on top of the tile where you want to cut and draw your line on top of the tape instead of the tile. This way you can see the line and it won\u2019t blend into the tile."

This prevents you from cutting into the bench itself. Loosen the clamp by twisting the top screw counterclockwise. Place the clamp vertically against the workbench so that the tile and bench are sandwiched between the ends of the clamp. Turn the screw clockwise until the clamp is tightly holding the tile in place. It\u2019s best to do this outside because the process creates so much dust. You can use another type of clamp if you don\u2019t have a C-clamp. You'll find a variety of types at a hardware store."

Once you remove the nut, pop the old blade out and set the new one in position. Screw the nut tightly back on over the new blade. Keep the wheel guard down at all times for safety."

Simply score it, then use that indent to guide your blade on your second pass for a deeper cut. Do as many rounds of cutting as necessary. Rushing the process will end up with jagged edges or an inaccurate cut. The harder the material of the tile, the more cuts you\u2019ll have to make. Wear protective glasses and a dust mask when using an angle grinder as there can be a lot of debris in the air."

You don\u2019t want to push hard enough that you cut all the way to the bottom of your tile. Scoring should sound like a scratching or crackling noise. You can buy a glass cutter at a craft store or hardware store for around $10.

If you don\u2019t have a wire hanger, you can use a thick piece of regular wire. It just needs to be thin enough to run along the scored line."

The wire hanger elevates the tile slightly off the table so the sides of the tile have room to snap off. Wearing safety glasses when you break the tile will protect you from any pieces that might fly off. The tile should snap very easily. If it doesn\u2019t, you may need to score it again. If you have a rough cut edge, you can sand it on a slab of concrete or a brick to smooth it out."
