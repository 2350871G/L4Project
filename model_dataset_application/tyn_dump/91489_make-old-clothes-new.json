          "description":"If you have a have a shirt that\u2019s lost a button, you don\u2019t need to discard it. You can sew on a matching button to make the shirt new again. You\u2019ll need a matching button, a needle, thread, and scissors. Double thread the needle and knot the end. Bring the needle up through the wrong side of the fabric and one hole of the button. Bring the needle back down through an opposite hole, and repeat this process of going up through one hole and down through an opposite hole six times with the same two holes. Do the same thing with the other two holes that you haven\u2019t used yet. You will end up with the thread making an equals sign on your button. Tie a secure knot in the thread by passing the needle through the stitches on the wrong side of the fabric stopping short to create a loop. Then pass the needle through the loop and pull tightly to create a knot. Repeat this twice to make a secure knot."

          "description":"You can update an old pair of jeans by dying them with RIT dye and gaining a fresh new pair of dark denim jeans. All you need is a 5 gallon bucket, navy RIT dye, gloves, a stirrer, and a pair of old jeans. Mix the dye with boiling water in a 5 gallon bucket. Follow the directions for the dye to find out the ratio of water to dye powder. Make sure you wear gloves while dying your jeans. Put the jeans into the dye, and stir them around with the stirrer. After about 5 minutes of stirring, pull the jeans out and wring out the excess dye. Rinse the jeans in a sink or bathtub until the water runs clear. Lay the jeans out flat to dry, or put them in a dryer."

Put on the sweater inside out and pin it where you want to resize it. Pinch the sleeves and pin them to know where to sew. Pin down either side of the sweater to make the sweater smaller. Carefully take the sweater off and lay it flat to make sure all the pins are straight. Use a sewing machine or hand sew the sweater in a line where the pins are. Cut the excess fabric after sewing it. Turn the sweater right side out and wear your new fitting sweater."

Cut the sleeves of the shirt off, and then cut the seam of the sleeves to open them up into a long piece of fabric. Lay the sleeves flat on a table and cut two identical rectangles out of the sleeves without cutting the finished hem of the sleeves. These will be the top of the dress. Cut a straight line across the top of the shirt just under the neck line. Discard the neckline of the shirt that you cut off. Cut the large portion of the shirt that\u2019s left up the sides to create two identical large rectangles of fabric. These will be the body of the dress. Use a sewing machine to sew the smaller rectangles of fabric to the bottom larger body pieces of fabric. You should end up with two dress pieces, the front and the back. Make sure you sew the wrong sides of the fabric together. Sew the front of the dress to the back of the dress, by sewing the sides together. Then, sew elastic for under the bust of the dress. Sew the elastic onto the dress right where the top piece meets the body piece. Stretch the elastic as you sew it. Cut any excess fabric beyond where you sewed on the top or sides. Then, turn the dress right side out."

Turn the jeans inside out to mark the jeans where you\u2019ll cut them. Start at the waistband and use a tape measure to measure down one leg. Make a mark where you want to cut the jeans. Do the same on the opposite leg, making sure the marks are at the exact same length. Keep the jeans inside out and use fabric scissors to cut the jeans where you made your marks. Starting at the side of one leg, cut straight across until you\u2019ve cut off the bottom part of the leg.

          "description":"You can spice up an old shirt by adding fringe to the bottom to create a stylish boho look. Use a shirt that fits well and is long enough to cut fringe from the bottom. Lay the shirt out flat and starting in the armpit of the shirt, measure where the fringe should start and make a mark on the shirt. Make a mark on the other side of the shirt as well and draw a straight line from one mark to the other. Using the bottom hem of the shirt as a guide for the ruler, make marks at the bottom of the shirt at \u00bd inch intervals across the shirt. Use the ruler to draw a straight line up the shirt from the bottom to the horizontal line you already made at each \u00bd inch mark. These are the lines you will cut on to create the fringe. Use fabric scissors to cut up each line you\u2019ve drawn, stopping once you reach the top horizontal line drawn. This should create fringe on the bottom part of your shirt that are \u00bd inch in width. Stretch out each strand of fringe after you cut it to make it hang better. You can add a unique touch to your new fringed shirt by adding embellishments to it. String beads on the fringe and secure them with a knot for a cool boho look, or tie every other piece of fringe together to create a netted look."
