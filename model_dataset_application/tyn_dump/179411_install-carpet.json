If you are putting carpet on a hardwood floor where you didn't need to remove carpet, you'll just need to do this step. Measure the length and width of your room.

Alternatively, force the room to be roughly rectangular and add a bit extra to your estimate. For example, if one wall has a small part that dips out, measure the 2 walls and then increase your estimate by 1 foot (0.30 m) on that wall. Multiply length times width to get the square footage. To get the area of a rectangle, you multiply the length (1 side) by the width (the other side). You do the same with your room measurements, and that gives you the square footage of the room. For example, if your room was 13 by 10 feet (4.0 by 3.0 m), then you multiply 13 by 10 to get 130 square feet (12 m). Add 10-20% to your estimate. You're going to make mistakes when putting in the carpet. Plus, you may have issues with getting cut pieces to fit in the areas you have left to cover after the main pieces are down. It's always better to have more than you need than to run back to the store because you ran out of padding or carpet. Buy carpet and padding based on your area measurements. When buying these supplies, they'll be listed in square feet or meters. Therefore, all you need to do is compare the square footage or meterage you found with what's being offered in the store.

    "Hit the flat, vertical part sticking out on the other end with your knee, making sure to apply some force.",
    "When you hit it, it tacks the carpet on to the strip.",
    "Move along the wall, hitting the knee kicker every 1 foot (0.30 m) or so.",
    "You may want to use knee pads for this process!",
    "You will have carpet sticking up over the trim.",
    "A knee kicker is a solid metal tool that's about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long with \"teeth\" that will grip the carpet on one end and a heavily padded \"butt\" on the other.",
    "It stretches the carpet over the tack strip.",
    "The tacks grab the carpet and hold it firmly in place.",
    "Stretch the carpet across the room and tack it on the other side.",
    "Using as much strength as you can, pull the carpet so it's taut across the room.",
    "Use the knee kicker to tack it onto that wall, too.",
    "Make sure all the lumps are out of the carpet.",
    "You can use a carpet stretcher for this process, which is a good idea if you have a large room.",
    "To use one, place the flat end against the wall you tacked on first, then place the flat part on the floor.",
    "It has a lever that gives you leverage and the head pushes the carpet across the floor to stretch it.",
    "Secure the rest of the room with the knee kicker.",
    "Tack the other edges of the room with the knee kicker, stretching the carpet as tight as you can while moving around the room.",
    "Remember, you'll have excess carpet on each side that you can trim off in a minute.",
    "Trimming the Carpet Run a carpet trimming tool along the edge.",
    "The carpet tool has a flat metal runner on the bottom, a handle on the top, and a blade on one edge.",
    "Press the tool flat against the carpet and right up against the baseboard on the sharp side.",
    "Push it along the wall, applying pressure as you do.",
    "You can use a box cutter for this purpose, but it must have a new, sharp blade.",
    "Run it underneath the baseboard to cut the carpet.",
    "If it starts getting dull, replace the blade.",
    "Also, use a box cutter to cut out spaces for your floor vents.",
    "Check that you cut cleanly through the carpet before taking the strip off.",
    "Look along the edge of the strip you cut off.",
    "Make sure no strings are connecting the strip to the main carpet, then pull it up and away from the carpet.",
    "If you yank up the strip without checking, you might pull fibers from the carpet that cause a run.",
    "Press the edge of the carpet under the baseboard with a carpet chisel.",
    "This tool has a wide, dull blade that lets you press the carpet in place.",
    "Use it to wedge the carpet under the baseboard by pressing into the carpet until it settles in place.",
    "Return any hardware you removed.",
    "If you took doors off, put them back in place.",
    "Put the door stops back.",
    "If you took up floor vents, screw them back in place.",
    "Move your furniture and belongings back in place, and you're done!"
