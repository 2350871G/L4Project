They are often called \"drain augers\" and are available at all home improvement and hardware stores. There are several types of augers that are commonly available. Choose one that has the round compartment on it, as these contain enough wire to get down into your drain. There are augers with shorter wires, which are called closet augers, but these are made exclusively for snaking toilets."

The bucket and towels will help you keep your sink area clean and dry while you work. The wrench and screwdriver will help you take apart your drain if it becomes necessary. Wearing gloves while you work on your drain will help to keep your hand clean and will help prevent injuries from occurring."

          "description":"Use your wrench or screwdriver to loosen the slip nuts on both sides of the P-trap. Once they are loose, you should be able to pull off the P-trap piece with just a bit of wiggling and force. The p trap is the curved piece of pipe directly under the drain on your sink. Its purpose is to keep sewer smells out of your house and to catch debris that might get lodged further along in your pipes. Place a bucket under the sink to catch water and other debris that will pour out when you detach the trap. Some P-traps require a screwdriver to remove and some require a wrench. You will know which you need by looking at the attachments on the P-trap under the sink."

If you are hitting a turn in the pipe instead of a clog, you may be able to get past it by pushing it through again. In general, a bend in the pipe will give your wire a complete and solid stop.

By turning the handle on your auger you will turn the wire in the pipe and hopefully dislodge some of the clog. Additionally, you may hook the clog onto the end of the snake. Turn the handle slowly. You don't need to move the snake quickly. Keep pressure on the snake as you turn it. Pressure on the wire will help push the corkscrew end into the clog."

To make this happen, be slow and gentle as you remove the wire. If you can feel a slight sensation of resistance on the wire as you pull it out, that is likely the clog hooked onto the end. If the end of the snake has a clog attached to it, move on to putting the drain back together. However, if it doesn't, push the snake back down the pipe and try to hook it once again."

It may take a few seconds to clear out debris in the pipe once you start running water. However, the water should begin to run freely pretty quickly if you have dislodged the clog. If you still have a clogged or slow drain, you can either try to snake the pipe again or call a plumber."

If this is the case with your snake, push the wire in a few inches and then lock the tool and rotate the wire. Repeat this by unlocking the wire, pushing it in a few more inches and then relocking and turning it.

    "Additionally, you may hook the clog onto the end of the snake.",
    "Turn the handle slowly.",
    "You don't need to move the snake quickly.",
    "Keep pressure on the snake as you turn it.",
    "Pressure on the wire will help push the corkscrew end into the clog.",
    "Pull the snake out of the drain slowly.",
    "If you have successfully hooked the clog onto the end of the wire, you want to keep it hooked so that it can be removed.",
    "To make this happen, be slow and gentle as you remove the wire.",
    "If you can feel a slight sensation of resistance on the wire as you pull it out, that is likely the clog hooked onto the end.",
    "If the end of the snake has a clog attached to it, move on to putting the drain back together.",
    "However, if it doesn't, push the snake back down the pipe and try to hook it once again.",
    "Put the P-trap back together.",
    "Once you suspect that you have removed the clog you can put the P-trap back in place.",
    "Put it in its original position and retighten the nuts.",
    "Keep the bucket under this area of the drain pipe so that if there are any leaks while you are testing the drain the bucket will catch them.Tip: Clean out any debris in the p trap before replacing it.",
    "Test the drain by running water down it.",
    "Run a steady stream of water down the drain to determine if you have cleared out your pipe.",
    "If the water starts to back up, turn off the water before it fills your sink.",
    "It may take a few seconds to clear out debris in the pipe once you start running water.",
    "However, the water should begin to run freely pretty quickly if you have dislodged the clog.",
    "If you still have a clogged or slow drain, you can either try to snake the pipe again or call a plumber.",
    "Snaking a Tub or Shower Drain Choose a small auger made to snake tub and shower drains.",
    "Most tub and shower pipes are small and easiest to unclog with a small, hand-held auger.",
    "These augers are easy to handle and flexible, which makes them great for pushing through narrow and angled pipes.",
    "These are available at all home improvement and hardware stores.",
    "There are two types of small plumbing snakes: drain augers, which are common small augers that have a round compartment with a long coil of wire in it, and closet augers, which are shorter and mostly used by plumbers to unclog toilets.",
    "A closet auger does not have the round compartment on it and so the wire length is much shorter.",
    "Choose a drain auger when getting a clog out of your tub or shower drain.",
    "Gather the additional supplies you'll need.",
    "In addition to an auger, you\u2019ll need supplies to open up the drain and to clean up any water or debris that is in the drain.",
    "Get a bucket, screwdriver, wrench, and rubber cleaning gloves and put them near the drain.",
    "Also, have a few old towels around to clean up dirty water.",
    "Remove any drain stoppers and screens in the drain.",
    "Many tub and shower drains have built in stoppers and screens that need to be removed in order to access the pipes.",
    "Unscrew any cover plates and disassemble any stoppers in your way.",
    "Every tub and shower stopper is different and thus comes apart differently.",
    "If you can\u2019t figure out how to take your stopper apart, do some internet research about your specific type of stopper.Tip: If you have a tub screen or a hair trap covering your drain and you are having problems with it not draining, pull it out of the drain.",
    "This will help water flow more easily and it may eliminate your drain problems right away.",
    "These items can prevent clogs down in the drain but they can also really reduce the ability of a tub to drain.",
    "Insert the auger wire into the drain.",
    "When inserting a snake, push the snake wire into the drain while simultaneously turning the handle on the back of the tool.",
    "This will turn the wire as you push, allowing it to move further down the drain through any clogs.",
    "Some snakes only turn when the wire is in a locked position and can't be advanced.",
    "If this is the case with your snake, push the wire in a few inches and then lock the tool and rotate the wire.",
    "Repeat this by unlocking the wire, pushing it in a few more inches and then relocking and turning it.",
    "As you lower the cable, move your grip down until it's about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the drain opening.",
    "This close grip allows you to control your motions and feel for the clog easier.",
    "Turn the handle on the snake to break up the clog.",
    "Once the end of the snake hits the clog, turning the handle will push the hook at the end of the cable into the clog so that it can be grabbed.",
    "There is no need to turn the handle quickly.",
    "Slow and steady pressure on the clog will work most effectively.",
    "Pull the snake out of the drain slowly.",
    "As you pull the cable out, turn the handle on the snake so that the cable rotates.",
    "This will help the cable move around bends in the pipe.",
    "Pulling the cable out of the pipe slowly will help to keep the clog hooked to the end.",
    "Determine if the drain is still clogged by pouring water down it.",
    "Run the water through the drain.",
    "It may take a few seconds to wash away the remnants of the clog, but it should begin to flow quickly.",
    "If the drain is still obstructed, snake the drain one more time.",
    "Insert the wire into the pipe once again and spend more time trying to hook the clog to remove it.",
    "If water still won't run through the drain after you've snaked it several times, it may have been pushed further down into your pipes.",
    "In this case, it's time to call the plumber.",
    "Snaking a Toilet Choose an auger that's made to snake toilets.",
    "All hardware and home improvement stores stock small hand-operated snakes that are made especially to get through the curves in a toilet drain.",
    "The snake may be called a toilet snake or a closet auger.",
    "The auger will consist of a long cable and case with a handle that moves the cable in and out.",
    "The cable will have a hook on the end to grab clogs.",
    "Push the auger cable into the hole at the bottom of the toilet bowl.",
    "For most snakes, you will rotate the handle as you push the cable out of the snake tool and into the drain.",
    "There will be areas that are difficult to push through but at some point you will likely feel strong resistance from the obstruction in your pipe.",
    "Stop pushing the wire in when it hits the clog.",
    "It might seem as if the cable has hit a wall when you hit a curve in the pipe but keep pushing to snake the pipe to see if it will go past the curve.",
    "You should be able to determine that what you've hit is the clog if you sense the clump giving way slightly as you press the cable it.",
    "Put on a pair of gloves and grip the handle with both hands if you have trouble pushing it down the pipe.",
    "Rotate the handle on the auger to break up the clog.",
    "The hook on the end of the auger cable is designed to grab items clogging the toilet.",
    "By turning the handle on the auger, the hook will rotate and dig into the clog.",
    "There is no need to rotate the handle quickly.",
    "Simply keep pressure on the cable as you turn the handle slowly.",
    "Pull out the cable and use a plunger to get the clog moving.",
    "Retract the auger cable slowly so that anything hooked on the end of it will be pulled out of the drain.",
    "Then plunge the toilet and watch for water to flow down the drain.",
    "Place the plunger over the drain.",
    "Make sure the rubber head is flush against the toilet around the drain so that it creates a seal.",
    "Then push the plunger so the rubber head inverts.",
    "Let it pop back up and push down again.",
    "Do this several times until water starts draining through the drain.",
    "If the water doesn't drain, put the plunger away and snake the drain again.Tip: Many drain clogs can be removed using a plunger.",
    "If you haven't already given it a whirl, it's worth trying, so you can avoid the more time-consuming process of snaking your drain.",
    "Snaking a Floor Drain Get an auger designed for snaking floor drains.",
    "This is typically a small, manual hand-held auger that is called a \u201cdrain auger\u201d on its packaging.",
    "These are available at all home improvement and hardware stores.",
    "Plumbers often use electric augers, but those are typically not worth the financial investment for fixing your own drain clogs that only happen once in awhile.",
    "Remove all covers and backflow valves from the drain.",
    "In most cases, you will have a cover on the drain that can be removed simply by unscrewing it.",
    "Once you unscrew it, look down into the drain.",
    "If you see an item that looks like a ball locked under a ring, this needs to be removed as well.",
    "Push a flat-head screwdriver between the edge of the pipe and the ring and pry it out of the drain.",
    "When working on the floor drain it\u2019s a good idea to wear rubber gloves.",
    "This will keep all dirt and debris in the drain off of your hands.Tip: Set the ring, ball, and cover aside in a safe spot so you can put them back in place after the clog is eliminated.",
    "Start pushing the cable down into the drain.",
    "Feed the cable out of the tool and into the drain until you hit the clog.",
    "To feed the cable you my need to release a handle on the tool, but each auger will be slightly different.",
    "Keep pushing the cable down into the drain even when you feel a bit of resistance, as this may simply be a bend in the pipe.",
    "When you have tried to push past an area of resistance several times to no avail, you have likely hit the clog.",
    "In some cases you can tell that you are at a clog because the cable won\u2019t advance any further but it gives a little every time you push on it.",
    "If it\u2019s stuck at a bend in the pipe, it won\u2019t budge with pressure.",
    "Hook the clog by rotating the cable in the pipe.",
    "Turn the cable by rotating the handle on the auger.",
    "Once you\u2019ve rotated the cable several times, pull up slightly on it to see if you've captured any of the clogged matter.",
    "Push and prod the clog so you can begin to break it up while trying to hook it.",
    "Work on the clog until you can feel that you\u2019ve punctured through the other end.",
    "Continue turning the handle to break up the clog into smaller pieces.",
    "If the clog won't seem to budge, it may be a solid object that you've hooked.",
    "Pull the clog out slowly.",
    "Pull the snake out of the drain with care by winding it back into the container.",
    "Be gentle so you don't lose the clog if it's hooked on the end of the snake.",
    "Clean the mess off the snake with a towel as it emerges.",
    "Dump the drain matter into a bucket.",
    "Keep pulling up as much of the clog as you can until the snake is free."
