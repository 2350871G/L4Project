Lift the blinds up toward the headrail, which is the top part of your blinds mounted to the wall. As you lift the blinds, use your dominant hand to pull the lift cords to see if they have any slack or if they control the blinds. Sometimes, alleviating some of the weight may be all it takes. Lift the bottom of your blinds even if they are already stuck at the top near the headrail. If the cords still don\u2019t pull or adjust the height of your blinds, then you may need to force the lock mechanism open."
