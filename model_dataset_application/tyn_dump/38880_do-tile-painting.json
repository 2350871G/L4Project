Open windows or bring a fan into the room for ventilation. Wear a painter's mask to avoid inhaling fumes. If you're working in the kitchen, move food to another area to prevent contamination."

Start by using a degreaser, then wash the tile with tile cleaner or soap and water. It\u2019s very important that your tile is perfectly clean, so don\u2019t skip this step!
