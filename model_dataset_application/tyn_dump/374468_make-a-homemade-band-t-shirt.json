You can print your image and text in color or in black and white. After you print out your logo or image, cut it out with a sharp pair of scissors. If the logo features text in it, then you will need to reverse the text to ensure that your words don\u2019t show up backwards on the shirt. If you\u2019re making a logo for your band, then create it using photoshop or another software program.Tip: If you have a blank T-shirt in your closet, you can use that to create a band T-shirt. If not, try checking a yard sale or second-hand store for blank T-shirts."

          "description":"Place the image right-side up on a piece of old newspaper or cardboard. Then, use a sponge brush to completely cover the image with the photo transfer liquid. Dip the brush into the liquid and then sweep the liquid back and forth over the image. The photo transfer liquid should be thick enough that you cannot see the image through it. You can purchase photo transfer liquid and a sponge brush at a craft supply store. The 2 items should cost less than $10 (USD) and you can use them again and again to make more band T-shirts."

You could apply it on the front of your shirt, on the back, or even on a sleeve. Depending on the size of the image you are transferring, you can center the design on the front or back, or put it off to one side for a little variation."

Leave it in a safe place to dry overnight or for at least 8 hours. Make sure that the shirt won\u2019t be disturbed by pets or small children. For example, you might want to put the item up on a high shelf or in a closed room. Try aiming a fan at the shirt to help speed up the drying process."

          "headline":"Use a wet sponge to moisten and scrape off the paper.",
          "description":"After your design is totally dry, moisten a clean sponge with water and begin dabbing at the top layer of paper on the design. Moisten the entire area with water and then gently start to rub away the top layer of paper. It should come off easily and reveal your image. After you remove the paper layer, your homemade band T-shirt is ready to wear! Keep in mind that the image will not be as dark as the one you printed. However, it should still be visible after you wipe away the top layer of paper. When the shirt needs to be washed, wash the shirt inside out on the delicate cycle and hang it to dry to preserve the image."
