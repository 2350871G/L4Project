          "description":"If the room has been painted and the windows aren\u2019t open, that paint smell is going to linger for a much longer time. Crack the windows as wide as you can to start introducing more air into the room. For many people, opening the windows makes the smell disappear after a day or so. If it\u2019s cold outside, open the windows 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) and turn your heat on. You may spend more on heating while the windows are open, but the cold air will really help with circulation in the room. If your windows don\u2019t budge when you try to lift them, it could mean that they\u2019re locked. Check the top of the window pane for 1-2 latches. Flip them and then try to move the window again."

          "headline":"Place fans in corners of the room and point them towards the windows.",
          "description":"Get some standing or box fans and put them in the corners of the room. Point each fan towards an open window and set the fans on their highest setting. Let them run continuously. If you don\u2019t have any windows in a room that you\u2019ve painted, open the windows in the nearby rooms and point fans in the windowless room towards the door. Put more fans in the hallway that point towards open windows in other rooms. Using a fan\u2019s oscillating function is probably a bad idea. The goal is to create a closed system that sends air outside, not all over the room. A ceiling fan will help though because it aids ventilation all over the room at once. If you have fewer than 3 fans, prioritize the corners furthest away from the windows."

          "headline":"Turn your air conditioning on to increase ventilation.",
          "description":"If you have central air, turn the air conditioning on. Turn any fan settings up to high and let the air conditioning system run. Pumping new air into your home will help push out the paint odors.Tip: If it\u2019s cold out, you can turn the heat on instead of the air conditioning. Heat won\u2019t be as effective as air conditioning though when it comes to removing odors. Hot air rises, and this can carry odors up to your ceilings. If you don\u2019t want the air conditioning on, you can always flip the fan on but leave the air off if you have central air."

It will also help the air flow out the window since it won\u2019t have anywhere else to go. Keep the windows open and the doors closed to help speed up the odor-removal process. Put a towel on the ground if there\u2019s a gap between a closed door and the floor to keep the smell from trickling under the door."

Cut the onion in half, and place each half in a small bowl or dish with the side you cut facing up. Put the two pieces in separate corners of the room on the floor. Let the onion sit for 24-36 hours and it will absorb a lot of the paint fumes. If you have any children or small pets, keep them out of the room while the onion is sitting out."

The water will absorb some of the paint odors naturally over the course of a day or so. It will also keep the room humid, which will hasten the odor-removal process.Tip: You can use white vinegar instead of water if you\u2019d like, but the vinegar will leave a different kind of lingering smell. Put 1\u20133 tablespoons (15\u201344 mL) of lemon or vanilla extract in the water to replace the smell with something more pleasant. You can slice real lemons and let them soak in water as well."

          "description":"Coffee grounds and crushed charcoal are phenomenal at neutralizing odors. Crush coffee beans or charcoal on a firm cutting board with a mallet, potato masher, or other flat object. Fill 4-5 small bowls with your charcoal or coffee and set them around on the floor of your room. Wait at least 36 hours before replacing them. Baking soda will work if you don\u2019t have any coffee or charcoal. Fill 4-5 small bowls with 2 cups (360 g) with baking soda and leave them out just like you\u2019d leave out the charcoal or coffee. Coffee is more likely than charcoal to leave a residual aroma if you leave it out."
