    "Rinse a 2 to 2 \u20442 lb (0.91 to 1.13 kg) cabbage and place it on your cutting board.",
    "Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the cabbage in half through the core.",
    "Lay each half flat and cut them in half again through the core.",
    "Then, cut away the white cores and discard them.",
    "Feel free to substitute red cabbage for the green cabbage.",
    "Cut 2 large potatoes into 2 in (5.1 cm) chunks.",
    "Rinse the potatoes and peel them.",
    "Place the potatoes on a cutting board and cut each in half lengthwise.",
    "Lay the halves flat and cut them in half lengthwise again.",
    "Then, cut across the potato pieces to create 2 in (5.1 cm) chunks.",
    "If you can't find large potatoes, use 3 or 4 smaller potatoes.",
    "Arrange the cabbage and potatoes in a roasting pan.",
    "Get out a deep roasting pan and place the cabbage quarters in it.",
    "Scatter the potato pieces around the cabbage so they alternate with the cabbage quarters.Tip: If you'd like to add carrots to the dish, cut 6 peeled carrots into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces and scatter them over the potatoes and cabbage in the pan.",
    "Set the pan aside while you fry the bacon and onions.",
    "Fry \u20444 pound (340 g) of chopped bacon over medium heat for 7 minutes.",
    "Chop the bacon slices into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces and place them in a skillet on the stove.",
    "Turn the burner to medium and stir the bacon occasionally as it fries.",
    "Cook the bacon pieces until they start to look crispy around the edges.",
    "If you don't want to include bacon in the dish, skip this step.",
    "Add 2 cups (300 g) of sliced onions to the skillet and cook them for 5 minutes.",
    "Carefully lower 2 cups of \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) sliced onions into the skillet with the bacon.",
    "Stir the mixture so the onions are coated with the bacon grease and cook them over medium heat until they soften a little.",
    "Avoid dropping the onion slices into the skillet or the bacon grease could splash you.",
    "Spread the bacon and onion mixture over the vegetables.",
    "Turn off the burner and put on oven mitts.",
    "Carefully hold the skillet in 1 hand and spoon the bacon and onion mixture over the vegetables in the roasting pan.",
    "Tilt the pan so the grease also drips onto the vegetables.",
    "The bacon grease prevents the vegetables from sticking to the pan as they roast.",
    "Pour chicken stock over the mixture and add salt and pepper.",
    "Slowly pour 2 cups (470 ml) of chicken stock or broth over the vegetables in the roasting pan.",
    "Then, sprinkle 1 teaspoon (5.5 g) of salt and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground black pepper evenly over the pan.",
    "If you prefer, substitute vegetable broth for the chicken stock.",
    "Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake it for 1 1/2 hours.",
    "Tear off a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap it tightly over the top of the roasting pan.",
    "Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake the cabbage and potatoes until they're completely tender.",
    "The vegetables will steam as they bake and they'll absorb flavor from the chicken stock.",
    "Remove the pan from the oven and let it sit for 15 minutes before serving the dish.",
    "Wear oven mitts to take the pan out of the oven and set it on the stove.",
    "Leave the covered dish to rest for 15 minutes so it finishes cooking.",
    "Then, wear the mitts to peel away the foil.",
    "Spoon the cabbage and potatoes onto serving dishes and ladle some of the bacon broth over them.",
    "Refrigerate the leftover cabbage and potatoes in an airtight container for up to 3 days.",
    "The dish will become more flavorful as it's stored."
