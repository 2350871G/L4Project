  "text":" Gardening cushion Remove the stopper from the hot water bottle.  Fill the hot water bottle with fabric scraps, cotton wool balls, rags, foam peanuts, etc. Fill as much as you can push through the stopper hole. It can help to use a ruler, stick or similar item to stuff the material inside the bottle. When you can\u2019t fit anymore stuffing inside the bottle, screw the stopper back into place.  Keep the bottle with your gardening gear. Use to lean on whenever you\u2019re gardening. Keep it clean by wiping down after use and hanging up to dry. This cushion can be used for other purposes too, such as a car seat bolster cushion, a head pillow for camping or lying in the grass, a rest for the iPad when outdoors, etc. Pet hair remover mitt Cut the bottle open following the seams.  Cut a square or circle shape from each side of the opened bottle.  Glue the pad onto a gardening or other long-term glove. Allow to dry. To use: Simply put the glove on and wipe over the area where you\u2019d like to collect pet hairs from. The rubber will pick up the hairs and can be brushed off with your hands or washed off. Unusual vase Attach the hot water bottle to the wall where you\u2019d like to place floral arrangements. It can be attached one of the following ways:\nUse a self adhering hook with a strong adhesive attached to the bottle. Attach two eyelet screws to the edges of the hot water bottle and attach string from hook to hook for hanging on a wall hook. Place flowers into the bottle vase. A dried flower bunch or a single long-stemmed flower make ideal flower displays. Try matching the flower colors with the water bottle for the most effective display. If adding water, be sure there are not leaks up to the level you plan on adding water. Foot rest Check that the hot water bottle can be filled with air without leaking. If there are leaks, this method won\u2019t work. Pump some additional air into the hot water bottle to make it taut. Screw the lid in place. Place your feet on the hot water bottle when seated. You can either simply rest your feet on it, elevated slightly, or you can gently pump or roll your feet on or across the bottle for gentle stretching exercise. Add more air as needed. Store flat. Quirky fashion bag Cut the top of the bottle off. You could cut it curved or straight, however you prefer. Attach handles. Glue or staple gun handles on each side of the top of the water bottle. Suitable handle ideas include:\nLeather or fabric straps\nPlaited twine or sisal\nRubber lengths\nBraided fabric\nOld belts\nAnything else you can find around the house. Another way to turn the hot water bottle into a bag: Make the base of a bag (back, front, sides but not top); reserve the hot water bottle as the top of the bag. The base of the bag should be wide enough for the bottle to reach over from the bag back to the front, as a \u201clid\u201d. Place a bag clasp into the portion of the bottle that was once the top.

In some versions of this bag, old military truck tarp was used as the back and sides of the bag. Bathtub shapes Find suitable templates for making the bathtub shapes. Look online or in craft books for shapes that your kids will enjoy. They should be a good size for small hands to hold. Turn the designs into cardboard patterns for tracing around. Cut the hot water bottle open to make two flat sides.  Place the cardboard patterns onto each side, drawing around them using a Sharpie or similar marker. Try to use as much of the rubber as possible by keeping the patterns as closely together as possible. Cut out the shapes. Discard the unused edges. Keep near the bathtub for playtime. They should stick to the edge of a wet bath and float in the water as well. When not in use, ensure that they are left to dry out so as not to mildew. iPad cover Measure the iPad for fit by laying it on top of the hot water bottle to check the bottle is large enough before proceeding.
