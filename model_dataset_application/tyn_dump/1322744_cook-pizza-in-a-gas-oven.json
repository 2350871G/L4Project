          "description":"This one change can make a huge difference. Gas ovens often have less even heat and more moisture than electric ovens. A preheated pizza stone heats your food faster and more evenly, and draws out moisture to prevent soggy crusts. Place it on the lowest or second-lowest rack, or wherever you usually bake your pizzas. Unglazed terra cotta tiles are an effective and much cheaper substitute. However, some clay contains lead or other non-food-safe substances. The risk is lower for tiles made in the U.S. or other countries that regulate lead closely. A cast iron pan is the next best option."

          "description":"Professional pizza ovens are much hotter than anything in your kitchen. Crank the oven up to the highest setting \u2014 at least 500\u00baF (260\u00baC). A pizza stone or heavy cast-iron pan takes longer to heat than your oven, so wait at least 30 minutes. A large pizza stone may need 40\u201360 minutes. If you want to be sure, check with an infrared thermometer."

Toss or pull your pizza until it reaches the desired thickness and size. Brush the lip of the crust with olive oil and add all the toppings. If you don't have a pizza peel, use a rimless baking sheet or an upside-down rimmed sheet, with floured parchment paper over it."

Once the end of the pizza is flat on the stone, jerk the peel back quickly to drop the rest of it. The preheated stone or pan is extremely hot, so be careful. If using a parchment-lined baking sheet, you'll get better char if you slide the pizza off the parchment paper and cook directly on stone or metal. If your pizza is messy with toppings, though, picking up the parchment and dropping it onto the cooking surface is an easier option."

Use a lower rack next time if you've been getting brown, bubbly cheese over a pale, doughy crust. Move the pizza to a higher rack if the crust ended up crisper or more charred than you prefer. All ovens are a bit different, so you might get different results, especially if your oven heats from the back or ceiling. Some people even place their pizza stone directly on the floor of the oven, instead of on a rack. This will make an extra-crisp crust, but some pizza stones will crack under that much heat."
