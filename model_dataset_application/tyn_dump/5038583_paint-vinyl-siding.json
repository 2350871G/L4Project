While it is possible to use a power washer to clean the sidings, be aware that the intensity of the pressure can cause the sidings to lift up, especially if you are not careful around the edges or wherever there are sidings placed at unusual angles. Moreover, the pressure risks pushing water up behind the siding, seeping into the wood and other material behind the sidings, which can encourage mildew growth or rotting.

The best approach is to talk to the retailer first, to get an idea of which paints are preferable. You should find that light colors are generally fine for vinyl sidings.

While the method chosen depends on your painting skill and personal preference, spraying is best left to somebody with experience. If this is your first time, you'll find it easier to work with either a brush or a roller. Even here, you need to make a choice between the faster and easier height application of the roller or the more time-consuming yet neater finish of the brush. It is recommended that your avoid sponge rollers and use a lamb\u2019s wool roller. These last longer and have a neater finish; they also tend to hold less gunk on them. A short roller will be needed as well as a long one; the short one is easier for fitting into the siding folds. Indeed, even if you're brushing most of the time, a small roller helps with tight corners. Brushes tend to give a better finish. They're also easy to use and you'll find that you improve quickly with the repeated practice. It's recommended that you choose a synthetic bristle for acrylic paint. In terms of size, a wider, larger brush will cover more ground than a smaller one but keep a small one handy for the tight corners and fussy bits.
