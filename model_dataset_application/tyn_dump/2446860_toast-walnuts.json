    "It would be beneficial to use a non-stick skillet, however.",
    "Add the walnuts to the pan.",
    "The nuts should only be cooked on a single layer, and it is not recommended to toast a large batch that forms a multi-layer pile.",
    "It is generally a good idea to start with the \"x\" facing upward on as many of the nuts as possible, but it is not essential, since the walnuts will not stay in the same position for long.",
    "Stir the nuts frequently.",
    "After the first minute or two, begin stirring the nuts.",
    "They can rest for 30 second intervals or so, but for the most part, the nuts should be stirred continuously to ensure even and thorough toasting.",
    "Use a heat-resistant spatula.",
    "Remove the nuts from the heat after 10 minutes.",
    "The process may take a little longer or a little shorter depending on how hot the heating elements in your stovetop make the pan.",
    "Once the nuts begin browning and become very fragrant, they are ready to be pulled off.",
    "You should also dump them out of the pan since they will continue cooking there even after it has been removed from the heat.",
    "Microwave Toasting (in Shell) Fill a microwave-safe pie plate with a single layer of walnuts.",
    "Any microwave-safe plate will work, but a pie plate is especially useful since it has raised sides.",
    "Keep the nuts to a single layer for even toasting and make sure that the \"x\" marking made in the shell is not covered by other nuts or facing the bottom of the dish.",
    "Cook the nuts in 1 minute intervals until done.",
    "The walnuts should be cooked on full power, and it will usually take several intervals before they finish toasting.",
    "The shells will not deepen in color like they do when toasted in the oven or on the stove, but they will become fragrant and the shell should begin to peel slightly at the cut part of the \"x.\"",
    "Stir the walnuts in between intervals.",
    "Stirring the nuts allows them to toast evenly.",
    "Keep as many \u201cx\u201d marks showing even after you stir the nuts, but if the marks become covered, the nuts should still toast without much problem.",
    "Removing the Shell (in Shell) Allow the nuts to cool slightly.",
    "Toasted walnuts taste best when served warm, so you should not let them cool to room temperature.",
    "They will be hot after you finish toasting them, though, and handling them immediately can lead to burns.",
    "Wait until the nuts have cooled just enough to comfortably hold in your hand.",
    "Peel back the corners of the \"x.\"",
    "The shell should have begun peeling up slightly at the \"x\" mark as the walnuts toasted.",
    "Use your fingers to grip the corners and forcefully peel the softened shell off.",
    "The shell may still pose some problem, but it can usually be worked off with only your fingers.",
    "Use a nutcracker only if necessary.",
    "If the shell is still too hard to peel away, gently crack it using a nutcracker as though the nut were still raw.",
    "Apply pressure carefully, though, since toasted walnuts tend to be a little softer than raw walnuts and will break apart more easily.",
    "Rub the walnuts with a towel.",
    "You can either use a clean dish towel or paper towel.",
    "Rub the towel over the nuts using small yet rapid strokes to remove the bitter skins.",
    "Serve warm.",
    "You can also store the toasted nuts in the refrigerator or freezer if necessary, but most people prefer the taste of warm toasted walnuts over cold walnuts."
