To make life easier, pull the machine away from the wall just enough for you to tip it back a little. Lift the front end a few inches off the floor. Slide bricks or solid blocks of wood underneath the front corners for them to rest on while you work so you can use a deeper dish. However, keep in mind that:\nThe washer weighs a lot on its own, and the water inside makes it even heavier. If possible, have a partner help you with this step to make it easier. Do not attempt lifting your machine if you don't think you're able to do so, even with a partner. Skipping this step just means more trips to and from your drain.
