  "text":" Steps Sift the 450g of icing sugar into a bowl.  Add in the egg white, peppermint essence and (1tbsp) milk.  Mix with your hands as you would for dough.  Add some milk if it has too much icing sugar. If it is too runny, add icing sugar. Take it out of the bowl when it reaches thick enough texture, and knead it on the on top of a table sprinkled in icing sugar.  Dust the surface with icing sugar.  Roll out the mixture till it is about half a centimetre thick.  Cut out small shapes (circles are easiest), and put them on a tray which has also been dusted with icing sugar. Do them quite thin. Leave for about 10-15 minutes then turn over.  Enjoy!  Alternate Method Whisk egg white until frothy. Sieve in the icing sugar and mix well. Add the peppermint essence and the colouring and mix well. Sprinkle icing sugar onto your hands. Roll teaspoon-sized amounts of the mixture into small balls and place on the baking tray. Flatten each ball with a fork to form flat discs. Place in the fridge for 1 hour until firm. Put the chocolate pieces into the heatproof bowl. Place the bowl on a pan of simmering water (about 5 cm deep).
