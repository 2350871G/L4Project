          "description":"Go on the hunt for a plain white mug with the right shape for the kind of design you wish to create. Mugs come in all different sizes, so explore your options. Think about how the shape of the mug might influence the design and vice-versa. Your mug can have a colored rim or handle, if you like, but make sure that the body is blank so that there's plenty of room to draw. Cheaper mugs tend to work best for holding the Sharpie design because they typically make use of a thinner layer of glaze covering the outside of the mug. Wash or wipe down your mug with rubbing alcohol and dry thoroughly before designing. This will get rid of any moisture, oils or fingerprint stains so that the Sharpie will draw on clean."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Buy a package of oil-based Sharpie paint markers.",
          "description":"While some people have had success making mugs with regular Sharpie markers, others have reported smudging and fading and recommend an oil-based paint marker instead. These are only slightly more expensive than regular Sharpies and will set into the ceramic surface of the mug better to produce a more durable, longer-lasting design. Sharpie is the most recognizable brand of permanent marker, but it's not your only option. Experienced crafters also recommend ArtDeco and Pebeo Porcelaine paint markers for a finish that won't smear or wash away."

Get creative: utilize different color combinations and take liberties with the shape of the mug and the space you have to work with, or blend text with visual elements for a collage look. The possibilities are practically endless! Use masking tape to craft precise lines and angles. Get as complex or minimalistic as you want. One mug might feature a single pastel flower design, while the next may be covered in a wild tessellation of bright colors."

After you finish designing your mug, let it sit in a well-ventilated area for a couple hours. Once the marker is dry enough to where it won't smudge to the touch, it's ready to go in the oven. Mugs decorated with oil-based paint markers will probably require a little longer to dry because of the thickness of the paint."

The dry heat from the oven will bake the marker or paint into the glaze of the mug, making it a permanent addition. The hotter the oven, the more thoroughly the marker will set in, but be careful not to set the oven any hotter than about 450 degrees, as this may cause the mug to crack or shatter. Put the mug in the oven before it has reached the specified temperature to allow the ceramic to warm more gradually."
        },

          "headline":"Heat the mug in the oven for 20-30 minutes.",
          "description":"Stand the mug on a flat baking sheet and place it into the heated oven. It will take about half an hour in the oven for the ceramic to hold the marker. Keep an eye on the mug as it heats to ensure that it doesn't become damaged. When heating multiple mugs at once, allow ample space between each mug so that the heat circulates more evenly between them. As the mug heats up, the outer coating of glaze will soften and the ink or paint will sink in, becoming permanent once it dries again. Don't leave your mug in the over for more than 30 minutes. Heating mugs in large batches might require a little extra time, but the chances of an empty mug shattering increase the longer it is exposed to intense heat.

You could create a decorated vase for flowers or a bowl for your kitchen table. Just make sure that whatever you're marking on is safe to put in the oven. Ceramics, most metals, and some glassware is fine, but wood, plastic, and crystal should never be put into the oven."

Simply take a small amount of dish soap and a dish scrubber or sponge and wash out the interior and rim of the mug, then dry gently with a clean towel. Some crafters claim that their mugs have held up fine under machine washing, but generally speaking the heat and pressure of dishwashers is extremely harsh on dishes with delicate designs."
