Every cake's instructions are different, but most can be made in under 30 minutes. You can also use a cupcake pan and make individual sized Jello cakes. These are great for kids' parties.

If you decide to make a layered Jello cake, use 1 box of gelatin for each layer. You could coordinate for holidays such as red and blue gelatin for the 4th of July. This is also a good idea, if you are trying to accommodate a lot of people who prefer different flavors. For a vegan option, use Weikfield jelly based on agar-agar (a seaweed). It is available in India and in Indian stores worldwide. It works just like Jello for this recipe. Jello is not a vegan dessert. Gelatin is a protein produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the various animal parts."
