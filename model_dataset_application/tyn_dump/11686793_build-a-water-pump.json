Push the pipe far enough into the tee socket to hold it securely without blocking the run opening, which is the single opening that branches into 2. You may need to warm up the end of the PVC pipe in hot water to soften it enough to fit into the tee socket. Look for PVC pipes and PVC tee sockets at hardware stores, home improvement stores, department stores, and online."

Push it far enough into the tee socket to be held in place, but not so far that it\u2019s flush against the back wall of the tee socket. If you insert the pipe too far into the tee socket, the water won\u2019t be able to flow through it.Tip: Use a hacksaw or a pipe cutter to cut longer lengths of PVC pipe down to size for your water pump."
