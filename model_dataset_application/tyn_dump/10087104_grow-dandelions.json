          "description":"Dandelions do best when they have full sunlight for a large part of the day, so choose a sunny location in your garden or plan to place potted dandelions in a sunny window. Try going out in your yard a few times throughout the day to scope out the sunniest spot. For example, you could go outside at 8 am, 12 pm, and 4 pm and note where the sun is at by placing a few rocks on the edges of where the sun is shining. If you will mainly be using dandelions for their leaves, then growing them in partial shade is a better option. This will help to reduce the bitterness of the leaves and the number of flowers it produces."

          "description":"The dandelion seed will need to be 6 inches (15 cm) apart for flowers and 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) apart for greens. Flowers will need more room than baby dandelion greens because they will have deeper roots. Measure the distance between your seeds to ensure that they will have plenty of room. Leave the seeds uncovered if you are planting indoors. You will not need to worry about the seeds getting blown out. Dandelions do best in a shallow bed. Do not plant your dandelions in an area with poor drainage or a tightly packed soil, such as clay. Use a garden fork to loosen the soil before you plant if it is tightly packed. Use a loosely packed potting soil with added compost as the growing medium."

Check the soil by poking your finger into it once every 2 to 3 days. If the soil feels moist, then they do not need water yet. If it feels dry, then give them some water."

          "description":"The roots of the dandelion should be large enough to harvest after the flowers have bloomed, but you can even harvest roots of dandelions that have gone to seed. To harvest the roots, insert a garden spade into the ground about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) from the base of the dandelion. Dig around the dandelion to loosen the dirt and make it easier to pull up, and then pull the dandelion root out of the ground. You may be able to pull up younger dandelion roots without digging since they tend to be shallower than mature ones. Dandelions are perennials in most climates. Leave the plant in place if you want to have it come back every year."
