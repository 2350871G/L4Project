          "headline":"Choose a large pot to house your mature eggplant.",
          "description":"The pot must have a 5-gallon (20-liter) capacity, at minimum, and each eggplant should have approximately 1 foot (30.5 centimeters) of space to grow. As a result, you may wish to plant only one eggplant per pot."

          "description":"Eggplants love heat, and clay pots retain heat better than plastic. Select an unglazed pot if you can remember to water your plants frequently, but go with a glazed pot if you have a history of forgetting to water your plants. Unglazed pots dry the soil out more quickly than glazed pots, so eggplants living in unglazed pots will need more frequent watering. Clay pots are also heavier than plastic pots, making it easier for them to support the weight of a mature eggplant. The pot should also have large drainage holes to help balance out the moisture level of the soil. Drainage holes will allow excess water to leave the pot, minimizing the risk of root rot."

          "headline":"Prepare a growing medium.",
          "description":"A good, simple option is a mix of two parts potting soil and one part sand. The soil provides your plant with the nutrients it needs, while the sand controls moisture. Mix in a timed-release, pelleted fertilizer using the instructions on the fertilizer label. Initially, it's best to start with a balanced ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium: e.g., 20-20-20 or 20-30-20. Reapply the pelleted fertilizer after 10-12 weeks. After the plant flowers, switch to a fertilizer with high potassium, such as 9-15-30."
