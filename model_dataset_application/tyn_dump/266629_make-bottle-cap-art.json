Apply spray paint using a sweeping, side-to-side motion from 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) away. Apply acrylic craft paint with a wide, flat paintbrush.

Try to cover as much of the canvas as you can, leaving a 1 to 3 in (2.5 to 7.6 cm) border around your silhouette. For a more complex artwork, try the outline of your state or country. You can also do your country's flag instead. If you can't see the pencil lines, use a piece of white chalk instead.

Choose bottle caps that match your design, such as red for a heart or green for a tree. Pound them flat against a wooden block with a hammer or mallet with the design side facing down. Make sure that you pound the edges outward. If you are doing your country's flag, use colors that match the flag. For example, if the flag has red and white in it, choose bottle caps that are red, and bottles caps that are white."

You may have to overlap some and off-set others in order to fill all the nooks and crannies of your design.

Check the label on the tube to find out how long your glue needs to dry and cure. Creating a Bottle Cap Tray Choose a plain, wooden serving tray that you wish to decorate. The tray can be already painted, or it can be unpainted. You can also use this method on tables, as long as they have a rim or lip of some sort. Craft stores typically carry unpainted wood trays in their wood crafting section. Paint your tray with acrylic craft paint, if desired. Apply a single coat of paint using a wide paintbrush made from synthetic, taklon bristles. Let the paint dry, then add a second coat if the first one is too thin. Let the second coat of paint dry completely before moving on. This should only take 15 to 20 minutes. You don't have to paint the bottom if you will be using grout around the bottle caps.

Arrange the bottle caps the way you want them on the tray. Place the bottle caps as close together or as far apart as you want. Arrange them in a grid-like pattern, or stagger them like bricks on a wall. If you want to create a specific design, such as a heart, use 1 color of bottle caps for the design, and a second color for the background. Glue the bottle caps down using liquid nails. Pick up the first bottle cap, and place a large drop of liquid nails onto the tray. Press the bottle cap into the glue, then move onto the next cap. Work your way back and forth across the tray in rows. Liquid nails is a type of glue. It is very thick and strong. You can also use an industrial strength glue, such as E6000. Hot glue may also work. Wait for the glue to dry and cure. Hot glue sets within minutes, but liquid nails and other types of industrial-strength glue typically need at least a day to dry and cure. Read the label on the tube or can to find out the complete drying and curing instructions. Mask off the sides of the tray with painter's tape. You will need to cover the top and inside walls of the tray with painter's tape. You can also cover the outside if you really want to. When you are adding the tape to the inside walls, make sure that you place it just above the tops of the bottle caps. Skip this step if you will be using clear epoxy resin instead of grout. Mix your grout. Buy a tub of grout from the craft store, and prepare it according to the instructions on the package. Grout from the craft store is finer than grout sold in hardware stores. It comes in different colors, has a finer texture, and is typically easier to mix.
