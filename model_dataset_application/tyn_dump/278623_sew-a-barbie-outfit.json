Dancing? Studying? Swimming? What type of outfit will work best for the place and purpose of the outfit? For example, you might choose to create a full skirt and short-sleeved top if Barbie needs a new outfit for a party. Or, you might make a pair of leggings and a sweater if Barbie needs something to wear to school. Or, you might make a new swimsuit and cover-up for a day at the beach!"

Find a pattern that matches up with your sewing skill level to ensure that you will be able to complete it. You can make any kind of Barbie clothing you want, but you have to use a pattern. Make sure that any pattern you choose is meant specifically for Barbie dolls. Not all dolls have the same dimensions, so using a pattern meant for a different type of doll may result in clothing that will not fit your doll."

For thread, opt for a color that will blend in well, such as white thread for lighter color fabrics, or black thread for darker color fabrics. If you want to create multiple pieces, such as a shirt and skirt, then try to choose fabric colors and prints that will coordinate well. If you purchase fabric from a craft supply store, check the remnants bin to find small-sized, discount pieces of fabric."

You might need to fold the fabric in half first, or you might need to pin the paper pattern pieces onto a specific area of the fabric or going in a specific direction. If desired, you may also trace along the edges of the paper pattern piece to create guides for cutting the fabric. Trace directly onto the fabric and then cut along the lines you have traced."

Insert the pins going perpendicular to the edges of the fabric. This will make it easier to remove them before sewing over each area. The right sides (print or outer sides) of the fabric pieces should be facing each other to ensure that the seams will be hidden on the inside of the clothing."

This will be plenty of seam allowance for a piece of doll clothing. Make sure to check your pattern for any special sewing instructions. It may recommend a special type of stitch or stitch setting to ensure that you get the best results."

          "description":"To prevent the fabric from fraying, it is a good idea to sew a hem along any remaining raw edges. However, this is not always necessary and your pattern may not require a hem. If you want to sew a hem even if it is not part of the pattern, then fold the edges of the fabric inward by 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) so that the raw edge is hidden. Then, sew a straight stitch along the edges of the folded fabric. Check your pattern to see if hemming the raw edges of your fabric is recommended."

Get some small 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) pieces of self-stick Velcro and apply them to the open edges of your Barbie\u2019s clothing as needed. For example, you could place interlocking Velcro pieces on either side of the opening for a dress, jacket, top, or on the waistband of a pair of pants. Make sure that your place the pieces so that they will line up and secure properly."

Keep making Barbie clothing pieces until you have completed your doll\u2019s outfit, and then try it on her! Make a dress with a coordinating jacket or shrug to wear to a special event. Sew a sweatshirt with a pair of jeans for a warm, fall look. Create a tank top and shorts or a miniskirt for a cute hot weather outfit."
