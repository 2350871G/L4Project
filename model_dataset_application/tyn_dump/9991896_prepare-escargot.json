Cooking Escargot with Garlic Butter Preheat your oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Turn your oven on to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and wait for the preheating light to turn on or for your oven to beep. Preheating the oven before you cook the snails will ensure an even cook. Mix the garlic, shallots, and parsley with a stick of butter. Place a stick of butter into a bowl and then dump the garlic, shallots, and 20 grams (0.71 oz) of parsley in the bowl. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix the ingredients together until the butter softens and turns green from the parsley. You can also pulse the ingredients in a food processor rather than mixing the butter manually. Fill the shell with garlic butter and a snail. Use a small knife to smear some of the garlic butter on the interior of the shell. This will serve as the bed that you place the snail on. Push a snail inside of the shell so it rests on the butter. Don\u2019t push the snail all the way down into the shell or it will be hard to get back out when you eat it. Put more garlic butter over the snail. Put a blob of garlic butter over the top of the snail and smooth the butter over. Place the snails an equal distance apart on a baking sheet, or place them in a traditional escargot dish. Your snails are ready for baking. The butter should run flush with the hole in the shell. Bake the shells at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for 10 minutes. The butter will melt and brown while it cooks.
