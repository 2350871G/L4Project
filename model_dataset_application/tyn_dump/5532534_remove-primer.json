          "description":"Measure out enough vegetable oil to cover the primer stain on your skin and pour it into a small dish. Most primers are oil-based, so plain water won't be effective against them. As oil-based products, though, they are oil-soluble and can usually be lifted with the use of additional oil. A little will go a long way, so you may only need 1 to 3 Tbsp (15 to 45 ml), even when you need to remove a large primer spot. Vegetable oil isn't your only option, either. Most cooking oil will work just as well. Try using coconut oil, olive oil, or canola oil if all-purpose vegetable oil isn't available."

This step is not strictly necessary, and you should be able to remove primer from your skin with only vegetable oil and no essential oil. The lemon oil can make the process slightly more effective, though, since the mild acid in the lemon oil can help cut through the primer without harming your skin."

          "description":"Pour the oil mixture directly over the primer spot on your skin. Use your fingers to scrub the area until you see the oil mixture turn white. The oil mixture will turn white when it has picked up most of the white primer. You could also use a clean rag to apply the oil mixture and scrub away the primer, but be prepared to sacrifice the rag since you won't be able to remove the primer from the cloth if it stains."

Rinse once more, then dry your hands."

Hold the blade at an angle, positioning it so that the sharp edge is nearly parallel and just slightly tilted toward the surface. Scrape down the drip, working from top to bottom, until most of the primer has been lifted away. Adjust the angle of the blade as needed to get at the primer. An angle that is too shallow won't scrap anything away, but an angle that is too severe can damage the surface you're working with."

If you use a sanding sponge, make sure that the sponge is labeled for use with the type of surface you're working on (wood, plastic, or metal). Before sanding the primer away, you should also put on a safety mask to avoid breathing in the primer dust. Start with a medium-grit and sand in one direction. Don't be discouraged if you don't see much initial progress; you'll need to sand for about five minutes, applying firm pressure the entire time, before any notable improvements show."

Soak a sponge in the detergent solution, then use it to vigorously tamp and blot at the stain. Do not scrub the stain since doing so may cause it to spread deeper into the fibers of the material.
