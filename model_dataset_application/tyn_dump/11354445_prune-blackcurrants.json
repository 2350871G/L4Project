Wait until after you have harvested the fruit and the foliage has fallen to prune the bushes, ideally in late fall or early winter.Tip: Blackcurrants are most productive from 1-3 years old. The most productive bushes will have a mix of branches that are 1, 2, and 3 years old. Blackcurrants bear fruit during the summer on the branches that grew the previous summer. So, if you have a blackcurrant bush that is in its first summer, then don\u2019t prune any of the new growth. This is what will produce the fruit during the next summer."

Aim to have no more than about 2.5 in (6.4 cm) of the branches you cut sticking up from the base of the bush. The closer you can get the cuts to the base of the bush and soil level, the better. This will keep the center of the bush from becoming congested and allow plenty of room for new, productive growth."

This will ensure the bush retains a strong, upright shape as it continues to grow throughout the coming year. Remove any branches that are criss-crossing with one another as well in order to keep the bush from growing tangled."

          "description":"Look at the remaining branches after you have cut away the old wood, weak wood, and branches that are growing horizontally or criss-crossed. Cut away more branches until you are left with no more than 10. That way, the bush can focus its growing energy on these, which will allow them to bear more fruit. When choosing which of the remaining branches to remove, select those that are growing the closest to others or look the weakest. Try to thin out the bush so it has a shape roughly like a goblet, with strong, evenly-spaced branches growing straight upwards. This can be the hardest part of pruning because you may have to select some of the healthy new growth to get rid of. However, just keep in mind that what you are doing will help the bush grow even stronger and yield more fruit."
