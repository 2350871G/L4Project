Add 1 2/3 cups (200 g) of bread flour along with 2 1/4 teaspoons (7 g) of instant yeast and \u00bd teaspoon of fine salt. Stir the dry ingredients until they're well mixed. If you don't have bread flour, you can use whole wheat flour."

          "description":"Pour 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons (250 ml) of warm water into a small mixing bowl or jug and add 1 tablespoon of honey. Stir the mixture until the honey dissolves in the water and pour it into the bowl of dry ingredients. Use your spoon to stir the ingredients together. You should see a shaggy dough form. If the dough seems too dry to form a rough dough, you can add a few teaspoons of water at a time and stir it in. Rye flour absorbs a lot of water, so it may need a little more."

          "headline":"Knead the dough.",
          "description":"Sprinkle a little extra rye flour on your work surface and scoop the shaggy dough onto it. Use the palms of your hands to knead the dough for about 10 minutes. The dough should become smoother (although not as elastic as dough made with white wheat flour). There are many ways to knead dough. For a basic way to knead dough, use one palm to spread the dough away from you. Fold the dough back to the center and turn it about 45 degrees. Use your palm to push the dough away again. Continue pushing, folding, and turning."

Put the bowl in a warm spot and let it rest for one to two hours. The dough should double in volume. If you use a clear bowl for proving the dough, you can easily see when the dough has doubled in size."

Use your fist to punch the dough down, so any air trapped in the dough is knocked out. If you'd like to add caraway seeds to the dough, you can knead 1 teaspoon of the seeds into the dough."

Use a sharp, serrated knife to make a few shallow slashes across the top of the loaf. Slashing the bread will give the air a place to escape as it bakes. If you don't slash the bread, the bread may tear unpredictably as it bakes."

Remove the pan from the oven and tip it out of the pan. Let the bread cool for at least 20 minutes before you cut it. You can tap the bottom of the bread to test for doneness.
