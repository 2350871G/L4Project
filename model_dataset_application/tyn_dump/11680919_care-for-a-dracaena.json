They will tolerate less light, but growth will slow down significantly and they won\u2019t look as green and leafy.Direct sunlight will scorch their foliage, so avoid exposing your dracaena to it. A sturdy window sill with east or west exposure will provide an ideal amount of light. If you see round, dry patches and streaks on the foliage, your dracaena is probably getting too much sunlight."

Cold water will shock the plant, so make sure it's lukewarm. Root rot is a common problem for dracaenas, so take care not to over-water them.How much water you give your dracaena will depend on its size, the size of its container, and the soil medium you're using. Let the soil dry completely between each watering, and then give the dry soil a thorough soak. If you notice that the leaves have brown tips, you may be overwatering. Yellow foliage typically indicates that your plant needs more water.Tip: Dracaenas are sensitive to flouride, which is commonly found in tap water. Use distilled or bottled water for the best results."
