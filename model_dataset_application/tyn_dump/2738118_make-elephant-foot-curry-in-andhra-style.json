  "text":" Preparing the Yam Wash chopped pieces of elephant foot yam under running water. Note! This type of yam can cause your hands to itch if cut with bare hands. Either wear disposable gloves when cutting or keep both your hands and the knife as dry as possible when cutting; once you touch water, the itching occurs. Add fresh water to the pieces of yam.  Boil the pieces of elephant foot yam.  Add salt. Once the elephant foot yam pieces are half boiled, add the 2 teaspoons of salt (or amount to taste). Adding the Curd Add curd after 10 minutes. This helps us to avoid an itching sensation in the diner's throat which is sometimes caused by elephant foot yam. Mix the ingredients together. Boil for 5 minutes. Drain the water from the yam pieces.  Adding the Seasoning Make Andhra seasoning with red chilies, mustard seeds, cumin seeds and white lentils. Add curry leaves also. Add the boiled elephant foot yam pieces.  Mix the seasoning mixture and yam pieces together.  Add the turmeric powder.  Add the sugar.  Mix well.  Dry Frying the Curry Cover the pan with a lid. Fry the ingredients until they acquire a golden brown color and have a slight crispiness. Serve the dry curry with rice with little ghee added to it. ",
