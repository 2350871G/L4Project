You can trim non-flowering shrubs anytime except late autumn when any new growth the plant has after trimming won't have time to mature before it goes dormant. If you're growing a hedge, trim it when the branches look overgrown until about 6 weeks before your area's usual first frost. Avoid doing extensive trimming when it is not your shrub's trimming season. Light trimming to keep it from looking overgrown is fine, but too much may damage your plant."
