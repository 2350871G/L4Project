Wash your hands thoroughly after handling them too. Mix together the cheese, hot sauce, and seasonings.

Then press the slit shut so the cheese is enclosed. Fill all of the peppers. Set the stuffed jalapenos aside. The cheese filling will help the jalapenos keep their shape. Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl. Crack 3 large eggs into a shallow bowl and use a whisk or a fork to beat them. Set the bowl of eggs aside while you set up a dredging station. Combine the breadcrumbs with seasonings. Get out another shallow bowl and measure 1 cup (125 g) of plain dry bread crumbs into it. Stir in 2 teaspoons (4 g) of dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of the ground pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt. Set the bowl next to the bowl with the beaten eggs. Dip the stuffed jalapenos in the beaten eggs and breadcrumbs. Lower a stuffed jalapeno into the beaten eggs and lift it up so the excess egg drips back into the bowl. Put the pepper into the seasoned breadcrumbs and roll it so it's completely coated. Repeat this for each jalapeno. Coat the jalapenos in another layer of egg and breadcrumbs. Lower the coated jalapenos back into the beaten eggs and lift them up so the excess egg drips back down. Roll the jalapenos in the breadcrumbs again so there's another coating of seasoning. Set the prepared poppers on a baking sheet or work surface while you heat the oil. Heat the vegetable oil to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Pour 4 cups (950 ml) of vegetable oil into a medium saucepan with high sides. Turn on a burner to medium-high heat and attach a deep-fat thermometer to the side of the pan. Heat the oil until the temperature reaches 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Fry 4 of the poppers for 5 to 6 minutes. Once the oil is hot, lower 4 of the jalapeno poppers into the oil and fry them until they're browned and crispy. Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to remove the fried poppers from the oil and transfer them to a paper-towel lined plate. Fry the rest of the poppers in batches and serve them immediately. Once you've removed the fried poppers, let the oil heat back up to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Fry the remaining poppers in batches of 4. Serve the hot poppers with your favorite dipping sauces such as ranch, creamy cilantro dip, or sweet and spicy sauce once you've finished frying all 12. Avoid storing the leftover poppers since the coating will become soggy. Baking Crispy Jalapeno Poppers Trim off the stem ends and slice the jalapenos in half lengthwise. Rinse off 6 jalapenos and use a small knife to cut off the stem ends from each pepper. Slice each pepper in half lengthwise. Scrape and rinse away the seeds. Use a spoon or melon baller to scrape away the seeds from each jalapeno half. Run the halves under cold water to rinse away any seeds that you couldn't scrape away. Set the halves on a towel to dry. Combine the cream cheese with the seasonings and shredded cheese. Set 8 ounces (225 g) of cream cheese into a medium bowl to soften.

Place 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter into a small skillet and turn the heat to medium.

Roasting Simple Jalapeno Poppers Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and prepare a baking sheet. Lay a sheet of foil over a baking sheet and set it aside while you prepare the poppers. Slice the jalapenos in half and remove the seeds. Use a sharp knife to slice 8 jalapenos in half lengthwise. Leave the stems on the halves to prevent the cheese filling from leaking out as the poppers bake. Use a spoon to scrape the seeds out of the peppers. Cut the cheese and fill the jalapeno halves. Get out a 6-ounce (180 g) block of sharp cheddar cheese and cut it into 16 evenly sized pieces. Depending on the shape of the block, you may need to trim the pieces so they fit the jalapeno halves. Cut the bacon in half and wrap each pepper with a piece. Cut 8 strips of bacon in half and wrap 1 piece of bacon around each cheese-filled jalapeno half. Set the bacon-wrapped poppers on the foil-lined baking sheet. Ensure that the ends of the bacon are tucked under the peppers so they don't unwrap as they cook. Roast the poppers for 20 to 25 minutes. Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook the peppers until they blister and the bacon browns. The cheese should melt once the poppers have finished baking. Remove and serve the poppers immediately. If you're using thick-cut bacon, the poppers may need to cook an extra 5 to 10 minutes.

    "Get out a 6-ounce (180 g) block of sharp cheddar cheese and cut it into 16 evenly sized pieces.",

    "Cut 8 strips of bacon in half and wrap 1 piece of bacon around each cheese-filled jalapeno half.",
    "Set the bacon-wrapped poppers on the foil-lined baking sheet.",
    "Ensure that the ends of the bacon are tucked under the peppers so they don't unwrap as they cook.",
    "Roast the poppers for 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook the peppers until they blister and the bacon browns.",
    "The cheese should melt once the poppers have finished baking.",
