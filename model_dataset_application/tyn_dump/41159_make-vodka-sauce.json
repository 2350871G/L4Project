As you start to prepare the sauce, bring a pot of water to boil on the stove to cook your pasta. Be careful not to overcook your pasta. Test it a minute or two before the instructions say it will be done to see if the texture is right. It should be slightly firm when you taste it because it will continue to cook while you drain it and in the sauce. You don\u2019t necessarily have to use vodka sauce on pasta.

While the combination of butter and olive oil offers the best flavor for the dish, you can use 4 tablespoons (120 g) of butter by itself or 4 tablespoons (120 mL) of olive oil by itself if you don\u2019t have the other ingredient on hand.

Stir it into the onion and garlic, and allow the contents to cook for 2 to 3 minutes so the vodka can start to reduce. If you would like a sharper flavor to your sauce, you can add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of vodka. You may want to experiment to see what amount you like best. To reduce the risk of fire, don't pour the vodka directly from the bottle into the pan. Instead, pour it in a measuring cup first and then add it to the pan from the cup. Make sure to have a lid for your pan nearby when you add the vodka. If it ignites, immediately place the lid on the pan to smother and kill the flames."
