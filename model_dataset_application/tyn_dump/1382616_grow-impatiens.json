Buy impatiens in one color or mix and match so you can create a colorful pattern in your garden. There are three common varieties of impatiens that each come in slightly different colors and have different petal sizes.

Whether you purchase seedlings or start your impatiens from seed, you'll need to make sure they stay moist until you're ready to set them out in pots or plant them in the ground. If you keep your potted seedlings outside, do not put them in direct sunlight, as this could dry out the small pots quickly."

Make sure the soil is moist but well-drained, since impatiens can get mildew if they spend time in standing water. Impatiens grow best in USDA hardiness zones 10 and 11. This includes parts of the southern and southwestern United States. To determine whether an area drains well, take a look at the spot after a heavy rain. If you see standing water and puddles, you'll need to add peat or another mix into the soil to help it drain better. You may also want to try re-directing rainwater flowing into the area. If the water gets absorbed, it should be a fine spot for planting."
