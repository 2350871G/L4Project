Use warm water for cotton, linen, and synthetic fabrics. If the clothes are heavily soiled, use hot water. If you're washing any white articles of clothing with any red or dark ones, use cold water. For delicate fabrics like silk and lace, use cold water. While you can hand-wash \u201cdry clean only\u201d items, it\u2019s best to take them to a professional cleaner."

Baby shampoo is a great choice because it will work just as well as laundry detergent and leave behind a fresh, subtle scent. If you're not sure if your shampoo has a tint, types that specify \u201ccorrect grays\u201d or \u201cboost color\u201d are almost always tinted.
