If you want to water each plant on its own, choose a dripper system to give your plants a direct water source. A dripper system consists of many square, flat waterspout-like \"drippers\" hooked to your irrigation piping that emit a small, steady water flow. Dripper systems also work well for potted outdoor plants. If you have a large yard or want to cover more area, you may want to choose another system."

Pick a sprinkler system if you have a large yard that needs even watering. Sprinkler irrigation systems consist of many sprinkler bulbs hooked to the irrigation piping that spray water out of their nozzles."

Choose a bubbler or sprayer system if you want to control the amount of direct water flow your plants get at a given time. Sprayer and bubbler systems look like a cross between sprinklers and bubblers. They are generally flat and square, with a nozzle on top that sprays a steady water flow.

  "text":" Choosing a Watering Device Install a dripper system to water individual plants. Dripper irrigation systems provide a steady flow of water to individual plants.

A dripper system consists of many square, flat waterspout-like \"drippers\" hooked to your irrigation piping that emit a small, steady water flow. Dripper systems also work well for potted outdoor plants. If you have a large yard or want to cover more area, you may want to choose another system. Choose a sprinkler irrigation system to cover more distance. Sprinkler heads can water a radius between 3 feet (0.91 m) to 30 feet (9.1 m), depending on the flow rate and water pressure. Pick a sprinkler system if you have a large yard that needs even watering. Sprinkler irrigation systems consist of many sprinkler bulbs hooked to the irrigation piping that spray water out of their nozzles. Buy a sprayer or bubbler system as a hybrid between drippers and sprinklers. Sprayers and bubblers have adjustable radiuses and can provide either direct or general attention to plants in your yard. Choose a bubbler or sprayer system if you want to control the amount of direct water flow your plants get at a given time. Sprayer and bubbler systems look like a cross between sprinklers and bubblers. They are generally flat and square, with a nozzle on top that sprays a steady water flow. Bubbler and sprayer systems tend to have a smaller radius than sprinkler systems. Planning the System Measure your yard's perimeter and area. Take measurements of the perimeter and area of your yard. Take measurements of the length and width, then multiply these numbers to find the land's total area. Work slowly to keep the land's measurements as accurate as possible. Purchase grid paper to map out your irrigation system. Grid paper can keep your drawing precise. Assign each grid a certain distance to help you visualize your backyard and plan an accurate layout. You might assign each grid, for example, a distance of 1 square foot (0.093 square meters). Draw an approximate layout of the irrigation system. Using your yard measurements, map out an approximate layout of your yard. Mark your yard's water source, power source, main plants or garden areas, and areas where you will install the irrigation tubing. The water source is generally the outdoor faucet, and the power source is the way you'll turn the system on and off. Use a pencil while designing the layout in case you need to make changes or correct mistakes. Laying out the Tubing Attach a vacuum breaker to the outdoor faucet and irrigation tubing. Vacuum breakers prevent contaminated water in your irrigation system from washing back up into your home's water supply. Screw the vacuum breaker onto your outdoor faucet, and attach your irrigation tubing to the opposite side of the vacuum breaker. Vacuum breaker are cylindrical metal tubes that screw into your home's outdoor faucet at the top. You can buy vacuum breakers from most garden centers or home improvement stores.

Connecting the Watering Devices Punch \u20444 in (0.64 cm) wide holes into the tubing. Use a hole punch tool to mark wherever you want to install a sprinkler, bubbler, dripper, or sprayer. Push the hole punch firmly into the tubing and twist it until it makes a complete, clean hole through the other side. Attach \u20444 in (0.64 cm) poly tubing to the holes with a barbed connector. Push the barbed connector through the hole in the irrigation tubing.

You can find barbed connectors, which are cylindrical metal tubing connectors, and \u20444 in (0.64 cm) tubing from most home improvement stores. Install the watering device at the end of the \u20444 in (0.64 cm) tubing. Attach the dripper, sprayer, bubbler, or sprinkler by connecting it through the end of the \u20444 in (0.64 cm). To hold it in place, attach a small gardening stake to the end and press it into the ground near the area it needs to cover. Flush and test the irrigation system via the outdoor faucet. Turn on your outdoor faucet to flush out any remaining dirt and test your irrigation system. Adjust the positioning of the watering devices or add more as needed.
