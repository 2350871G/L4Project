Mitchell Newman, the Principal of Habitar Design and Stratagem Construction, says: \"If you're removing regular tongue-and-groove flooring that isn't glued to the floor, the hardest part will be prying the first few boards loose with your crowbar. Once you do that, you can just use your crowbar to keep pulling up the boards all the way across the floor. If the floor is glued, you can just set your saw up for a cut that's the exact thickness of the board, then pull it up with a crowbar after you cut it.\""
