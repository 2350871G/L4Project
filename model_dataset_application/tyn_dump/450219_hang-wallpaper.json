Try to avoid having a visually significant item in the pattern exactly at the top of the wall. Ceiling lines tend to rise and fall and if you have a visually significant item at the ceiling you will begin to lose the pattern if the ceiling dips. Try to choose a \u201ctop\u201d about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above any significant pattern items. This will allow for the ceiling to rise and fall without affecting the visibility of this item. If you can, choose a \u201ctop\u201d that has a small item in the pattern on the left or right edge of the paper that is easy to identify. This will make measuring and cutting much easier. Drop match patterns will have two \u201ctops\u201d. You will alternate between \u201ctop A\u201d and \u201ctop B\u201d as you progress around the room.

Now, lift and pull the rest of the unpasted portion onto the table - the pasted/folded portion may hang off the edge - and paste the rest of the sheet. Pick up the wallpaper and let it hang in your hands. If watery adhesive pours out of it, then you have definitely used too much adhesive or the paste is too thin.

Unfold only the short fold and align only the right edge of the paper to the penciled plumb line taking care to ensure your \u201ctop\u201d is at the ceiling where you want it. Before you rub this section out with your smoothing brush, notice if you are able to move or \u201cslip\u201d the paper on the wall slightly. The slip indicates that you have an adequate amount of adhesive on the back of the paper. If you have no slip, then you need to add a bit more adhesive at the pasting table.

You want to apply the paper by smoothing, not before smoothing. Ensure that you have not slipped or rubbed the paper\u2019s right edge away from the plumb line. Never use significant force to smooth bubbles out or force alignment to plumb lines and seams with the smoother. Get the top edge as close to the wall as possible, and don't worry about cutting off excess. Cutting the extra off too soon may cause a misalignment."

Carefully find the bottom edge of the paper, lift away from the wall slightly so the paper you are pulling down will not stick to the wall and gently pull it down the wall until it is completely unfolded. You may undo an inch or two of the initial work above but that\u2019s no big deal. Starting at the top right of this section, use your 24 inch (61.0 cm) level as a guide to stay plumb at the right edge and smooth out the rest of the paper starting from right to left.

This should give you a nice little crease all the way across the width of the paper. Starting at the right edge of the paper, place the joint knife in the crease holding the handle down. Take the razor blade and press it into the crease on top of the blade \u2013 cut on the ceiling side of the joint knife - right to left. Once you run out of joint knife blade, move the joint knife to the left and cut another 6 inches (15.2 cm). One more cut should get you very close to the corner. If you can, go ahead and cut all the way to the corner. You may not be able to get the razor blade into the corner. If so, you can peel back the corner of the wallpaper and by using the already cut portion as a guide, cut the remaining excess wallpaper \u201coff the wall\u201d and then place the corner section of the wallpaper back into place."

Take your time, wallpaper adhesive can be hard to see. Don\u2019t forget to clean the glue off the ceiling joint and baseboard. Avoid using terry cloth rags or towels.

Unfold only the short fold and align only the right edge of the paper to the penciled plumb line taking care to ensure your \u201ctop\u201d is at the ceiling where you want it. Before you rub this section out with your smoothing brush, notice if you are able to move or \u201cslip\u201d the paper on the wall slightly. The slip indicates that you have an adequate amount of adhesive on the back of the paper. If you have no slip, then you need to add a bit more adhesive at the pasting table. Slip is your friend as long as you don\u2019t have too much. Stick the paper to the wall. Once you have good alignment with the plumb line at the right edge. Take your smoother and gently rub the paper to the wall in a left and up direction. You want to apply the paper by smoothing, not before smoothing. Ensure that you have not slipped or rubbed the paper\u2019s right edge away from the plumb line. Never use significant force to smooth bubbles out or force alignment to plumb lines and seams with the smoother. Get the top edge as close to the wall as possible, and don't worry about cutting off excess. Cutting the extra off too soon may cause a misalignment. Stick the bottom half of the strip. Now you should have the top 36 inches (91.4 cm) of wallpaper applied to the wall with the rest of the paper still folded up. Carefully find the bottom edge of the paper, lift away from the wall slightly so the paper you are pulling down will not stick to the wall and gently pull it down the wall until it is completely unfolded. You may undo an inch or two of the initial work above but that\u2019s no big deal. Starting at the top right of this section, use your 24 inch (61.0 cm) level as a guide to stay plumb at the right edge and smooth out the rest of the paper starting from right to left. Don\u2019t force the paper over to the corner, let gravity help place the paper onto the wall. Cut off the top excess. Get your 6 inch (15.2 cm) joint knife and a new razor blade and go back to the ceiling. Work the edge of the joint knife blade into the ceiling joint. This should give you a nice little crease all the way across the width of the paper. Starting at the right edge of the paper, place the joint knife in the crease holding the handle down. Take the razor blade and press it into the crease on top of the blade \u2013 cut on the ceiling side of the joint knife - right to left. Once you run out of joint knife blade, move the joint knife to the left and cut another 6 inches (15.2 cm). One more cut should get you very close to the corner. If you can, go ahead and cut all the way to the corner. You may not be able to get the razor blade into the corner. If so, you can peel back the corner of the wallpaper and by using the already cut portion as a guide, cut the remaining excess wallpaper \u201coff the wall\u201d and then place the corner section of the wallpaper back into place. Cut off the bottom excess. Cutting the excess at the base board works the same as the ceiling, except the joint knife handle will face up the wall. Remember to cut on the baseboard side of the joint knife, not the wall side. If you try to make these cuts on the wall side your razor blade can wander and give you an uneven cut. Again, if you cannot get all the way to the corner, pull the corner back, make your cut and then place the finished corner back into place. Wipe off messy adhesive. It\u2019s guaranteed that you have some adhesive on the surface of your freshly hung paper. Using clean water and sponge, wipe down the wall covering \u2013 top to bottom. Take your time, wallpaper adhesive can be hard to see. Don\u2019t forget to clean the glue off the ceiling joint and baseboard. Avoid using terry cloth rags or towels. They can be too abrasive and can ruin the finish of your wall covering. Smooth out any bubbles that might have formed in the wallpaper with your sponge. The strip of paper should be completely smooth when you're finished. Continue adding strips. Use the aforementioned steps to continue adding more strips of wallpaper. As you add each strip, take time to line up the pattern and overlap when necessary. Well hung wallpaper will lack any visible seams and discrepancies in the pattern. Hanging Wallpaper Around a Window or Door Hang your paper above a window or door. Continue adding your paper towards the right until you hit the frame. Rub your finger against the wall covering and through the paper feel and locate the top left corner of the window or door trim. Once you locate the exact corner, take your razor blade place it at the exact location of the corner and cut at a downward at a 45 degree angle towards the center of the door or window. Once you are about three inches down and away from the starting corner, level out your cut and cut toward the right until you have cut all the way across the paper. Cut the excess paper just inside the frame all the way down the edge of the window. You will go back later and make exact cuts along the frame. Work around the window. Continue adding strips of wallpaper around the window, making sure to keep a plumb line so that your strips are perfectly vertical. At the areas that hit the window, cut downwards at a 45 degree angle and then around the inside of the frame. You should eventually get to a point at which your window or door has a rough cutout of wallpaper around it. Cut off the excess. Use a straight edge and a new blade on your knife to get a smooth cut around the frame. Press the wallpaper completely flat and smooth out any bubbles, and then use the straight edge to hold the paper to the frame. Use the knife to cut along the straight edge and create a perfect shape around the window. Adding Wallpaper to Corners Make your measurements. Take your ruler or tape measure and measure the exact distance from your right edge of the last piece on the wall to the corner. Measure three times: at the top, middle and bottom. Take note of the longest measurement. If the three numbers are the same or very close, your corner is relatively plumb and you have done a good job keeping your wallpaper plumb as well. Take the longest of the three corner measures and add about 3/8 of an inch. This will be the length you measure your wallpaper to. Once you get good, you can consider using 1/4 of an inch in the cutting process instead of 3/8 of an inch. Make your first cut. Place a previously pasted and booked sheet of wallpaper onto your cutting table with your \"top\" and \"bottom\" edges facing up. Place the ruler across the wallpaper just at one of the folded ends on the table and carefully measure from the left seam (if you are approaching the corner from the left) over to your \"length + 3/8\" distance. Take a razor blade and make about a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) cut parallel to the edge (seam) of the paper at this mark. Finish cutting. Repeat your \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) cut at the other end of the folded paper using the same \"length + 3/8\" distance. Now you should have a small cut at both ends. Hold the ruler down reasonably firmly so that it does not slip as you cut. Take a new razor blade and make a lengthwise cut in order to cut the wallpaper into two sections. You now have a \"to the corner\" section and an \"after the corner\" section. Hang the \"to the corner\" section. This piece should overlap the corner at least \u20448 inch (1.0 cm), and if your walls are crooked it may overlap the corner by more at the top middle or bottom. The key is to have overlap \"top to bottom\" at the corner, but too much overlap can be noticeable. If the overlap is greater than about 3/8 of an inch, take a fresh razor blade and making a freehand vertical cut, carefully cut away any overlap that is greater than 3/8 of an inch. Measure the width of your \"after the corner\" section. Take your level and draw a plumb 36\" pencil line onto the new wall at this distance. Using the plumb line as a guide, hang this piece and get as good of a pattern match in the corner as possible. Again, it is most critical that this piece be plumb as it will set the stage for hanging the next wall nice and straight. You want to avoid overlapping back onto the prior wall if you can. It's better for this piece to not quite make it back to the corner than overlapping. The 3/8\" overlap from the first piece will ensure you have wallpaper in the corner. If by chance, there is a \"gap\" where the second section does not get to the first section's \"overlap\", then remove the full second section, lightly re paste, and rehang.",

    "This will allow for the ceiling to rise and fall without affecting the visibility of this item.",
    "If you can, choose a \u201ctop\u201d that has a small item in the pattern on the left or right edge of the paper that is easy to identify.",
    "This will make measuring and cutting much easier.",
    "Drop match patterns will have two \u201ctops\u201d.",
    "You will alternate between \u201ctop A\u201d and \u201ctop B\u201d as you progress around the room.",
    "Most of the time with a drop match, you choose the \u201ctop A\u201d and take what you get with the \u201ctop B\u201d.",
    "Cut your wallpaper.",
    "On the table, cut your wall covering about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your designated \u201ctop\u201d ensuring you do not cut a crooked line or wavy line that extends down into the pattern where your \u201ctop\u201d is.",
    "This will give you excess while hanging and this will be trimmed away on the wall.",
    "Take a razor blade and cut the roll about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) beyond the total length measurement.",
    "This excess will be cut off on the wall.",

    "Pick up the wallpaper and let it hang in your hands.",
    "If watery adhesive pours out of it, then you have definitely used too much adhesive or the paste is too thin.",
    "A few drops is OK, but you should not have a significant amount of dripping glue.",
    "Book the paper.",
    "Most wall coverings will expand due to the moisture in the adhesive; 20 and \u00bd inch wallpaper will expand and become 20 and \u00be inch wallpaper.",
    "If you were to try to hang this right away, you would discover that vertical bubbles would appear and will not smooth out.",
    "Let the paper sit in the folded position for around 10 minutes, to give the adhesive time to expand the paper completely.",
    "Align the first strip.",
    "Get your ladder in place, smoothing brush in pocket, and booked piece of paper.",
    "You can quickly identify which is the top as it will be the shorter of the two folds.",
    "Unfold only the short fold and align only the right edge of the paper to the penciled plumb line taking care to ensure your \u201ctop\u201d is at the ceiling where you want it.",
