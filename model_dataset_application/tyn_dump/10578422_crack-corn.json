Pull the remaining leaves down at the same time. Most of the silk, the hairs inside the leaves, will come off as well. Check the cob to make sure all the silk is gone. The strands are easy to overlook and may stick to the corn sometimes. Peel the remaining strands off by hand. If some of the silk strands are hard to remove, try microwaving the corn for 1 minute."

Set the dehydrator, then wait for the corn to turn hard and dry. At a minimum, this takes 6 to 8 hours. The drying time depends on how fresh the corn is and how much humidity is in your environment. If you don\u2019t have a dehydrator, put the corn in an oven set to 175 \u00b0F (79 \u00b0C). Leave the oven door open so the moisture is able to escape. The corn will dry out in about 8 to 10 hours. Another option, if you have fresh corn on the cob, is to hang the cobs in a cool, dry place for 3 to 4 weeks."
