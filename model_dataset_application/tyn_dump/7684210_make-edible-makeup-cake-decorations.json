For example, if you want to make a lipstick for your cake, then you might need some red or pink fondant. If you want to make an eyeshadow palette, then you might want some green, purple, or blue fondant. Jot down the makeup items you want to make and what colors you think you will need to make them. Since most makeup is cased in black plastic, black fondant is essential for making edible makeup. To dye fondant, you will need to use food safe dye.

Stick a clean toothpick into the dye and then stick it into the fondant to transfer the dye. Make sure that you discard toothpicks after they have touched the fondant. Do not dip them into the dye again. It is almost impossible to dye fondant black, so you will probably need to buy black fondant at a craft store. Other dark colors, such as red, can be difficult to achieve, so you may want to purchase these colors as well."

If the color is too dark, then add some white fondant and knead the dyed piece with the white piece to lighten the color."
