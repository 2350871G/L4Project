  "text":" Getting Killed by Enemies Go to any enemy that is near you. Make sure that you are in a place full of enemies so that they can come to you and kill you easily. Attract them to come to you slowly. Get their attention by going within their eyesight so that they can follow and attack you. Let them reach and kill you. Just stand in a spot where they can easily reach you and allow their methods to kill you until you run out of health or you are too small and die. Coming Across Hazards Walk up to a hazard that is capable of inflicting damage on you. This can include fire, electricity, ice, quicksand, lava, black-holes, dark matter, or poison. Allow the hazard to damage you or come in close contact with it until you begin losing a lot of damage from the hazard.  Let the hazard kill you slowly. Enjoy the torture of the Italian plumber! Encountering Obstacles Run up to an obstacle or to a place filled with obstacles. Obstacles are any objects that can inflict damage on you and are not related to hazards as hazards are energy or elements. Wait for the obstacle to activate or to come near you. Let it do its thing before it starts to damage you and slowly kill you. Let the suicide begin!
