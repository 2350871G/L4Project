Instead of vinegar, use mild cork-floor or wood-floor detergent, diluted according to label instructions. You may use another mild, pH-neutral cleaner, but test it underneath furniture first to see if it leaves a mark. Go easy if using dish soap or another sudsy cleaner, as too much of it can leave a soapy film on the floor."

Although cork is durable and moisture-resistant, cork is a type of wood flooring, and will eventually absorb moisture if it isn't removed. If the spill has caused a stain, use the vinegar or detergent solution described above. Repeat with a more concentrated solution if necessary, or look for a specialized cork floor cleaning product."

Reapply the finish after cleaning. If the floor has a wax finish, clean with liquid solvent wax. If this doesn't do the trick, use a buffer (low speed floor machine) with 00 steel wool disks, followed by lamb's wool disks and another application of wax."

Ideally, reapply using a sealant recommended by the manufacturer, or at least one that specifically mentions cork on the label. This is usually a water-based polyurethane finish. You may use curable oil or hard wax oil, but these are more work to apply and last for a shorter time. Typically, to apply polyurethane, gently abrade the floor and roll on the finish using a foam roller. Leave it untouched for 24\u201348 hours. Follow the instructions on your finish label if it gives contradictory advice. Floor-stripping chemicals may harm the cork. To avoid having to use them, stick with the same type of finish each time. A typical home may get 5\u201310 years of use out of a polyurethane finish, or 1.5\u20132 years from wax. Cork floors in busy public buildings or businesses may need sealing every few months."
