  "text":" Mixing Dry Ingredients and Oil Pour 2 cups of flour into a large mixing bowl. Use all-purpose flour for this. Add \u00bd cup of salt. Pour this into the mixing bowl with the flour. Add 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar. Add this to the bowl with flour and salt. This ingredient gives it the elastic consistency that makes playdough stretchy and malleable. If you don\u2019t have cream of tartar available, you can use this recipe without it, but your playdough may be less malleable. Mix the dry ingredients. Stir the flour, salt, and cream of tartar together with a whisk or wooden spoon. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the oil to the dry ingredients and mix with a whisk or spoon. Adding the Color Boil 1 \u00bd cups of water. Use the microwave or stove to bring water to a boil, with parental supervision. Add a few drops of food coloring to the boiling water. Use traditional liquid or gel food coloring or a natural alternative, in whatever colors you like. Remember that a couple drops go a long way. You can add more later if needed. If you want playdough in several different colors, split your dough into however many containers as colors you want, and do the same with the water after it has boiled before adding color to each one.
