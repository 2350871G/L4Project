If the candle has any metal cases or similar pieces, remove those pieces before placing them in the tin. Leave the wick intact, but make sure that each wick stands upright.

Once the wax cools and hardens, you should be able to remove the firelighters from the tin. Peel away the liners from the wax before using. Keep the firelighters in sealed plastic containers until ready to use. Method Two: Corks Place pieces of cork inside a mold. Break apart a few corks and arrange the pieces inside a paper cup. The cup should only be about half full. The cork can be broken, crushed, or cut, but smaller pieces are more ideal than whole corks. Cork is a very dry and absorbent material, which allows them to act as very effective firelighters. If you do not want to use a paper cup, you could also use something like an ice cube tray. Just make sure that the mold is fairly small and durable enough to withstand the heat of the melted wax. Add a wick to each mold. Cut a small strip of rope and place it in the cup, wedging it in between pieces of cork. The rope should be upright. If you don't have rope, you could make a wick by rolling a strip of flammable fabric, cardboard, or paper into a thin tube. Pour melted wax inside. Slowly pour enough melted wax into the cup to completely cover the cork. Make sure that the wick is partially submerged and partially exposed. Candle wax works notably well. Work carefully when handling melted wax. Liquified wax is very hot and can easily cause burns if brought into contact with the skin. Allow the wax to set. Set the cup aside and allow the wax to completely cool. Once the wax has hardened, you should be able to peel off the paper cup. Store the firelighters in resealable plastic bags until ready to use. Method Three: Stuffed Toilet Roll Cores Close one end of a roll. Press one open end of a cardboard toilet paper tube closed, keeping the edge closed with one or two staples. The cardboard should catch fire and burn well enough, so you do not need to insert a separate wick into this firelighter. If you do not have a toilet paper tube, you could cut a cardboard paper towel core into two or three pieces and use that, instead. Stuff the rest of the role with a flammable material.

You could even use a vice to hold the tube in place. Do not hold the tube with your hands. Let it harden. Keep the tube standing upright and undisturbed for 30 minutes or so, or until the wax completely cools and sets in place. You should be able to tell when the wax is ready simply by peeking inside the tube. The wax should appear completely solid. If you want to double check, gently squeeze the sides of the cardboard tube. They should feel cool and solid. Staple the other end closed. Press the remaining open end of the tube together. Keep the end sealed by stapling it in place. Consider soaking the finished product in paraffin. The firelighter should work well enough as it is, but if you want the cardboard to burn for a longer period of time, soak the entire thing in a bit of liquid paraffin for 30 seconds. Remove the firelighter from the paraffin and let it dry. Store in an airtight container. Keep the cardboard firelighter in an airtight plastic container until you are ready to use it. Method Four: Cotton Dip cotton balls into petroleum jelly. Rub a cotton ball into a bit of petroleum jelly. Use your fingers to work the petroleum jelly into the fibers of the cotton, thoroughly coating the entire piece. You could use a cotton makeup pad instead of a cotton ball, if desired. Either option should work well. Alternatively, dip the cotton into melted wax. Grab the cotton ball or cotton pad with a pair of tweezers and slowly lower it into a pot of melted candle wax. Work carefully to avoid accidentally burning yourself on the wax. Coat the majority of the cotton, leaving only a small patch uncovered. Place the coated cotton on a sheet of wax paper and let the wax on the cotton cool and harden. Store the firelighters in a sealed container or bag. Place the coated cotton in a plastic bag or plastic container. Keep them there until you are ready to use them. Make sure that no moisture can get inside the container as you store it. Method Five: Teabags Place the teabags in a pan. Spread the bags out evenly in the bottom of a shallow baking tray or similar container. This is a great way to recycle teabags already used to brew tea. If you use loose tea leaves instead of teabags, place the leaves into the bottom of a paper cup, ice cube tray compartment, or similar mold. Pour melted wax over them. Carefully pour a small amount of melted candle wax over each tea bag, using just enough wax to cover the bag or the leaves.
