Then add 4 dashes of bitters and stir the ingredients together. Finally, use a strainer to strain the cocktail into a small rocks glass with ice. Add 2 twists of lemon peel to the top of the drink for a zesty garnish. You can use other forms of whiskey besides bourbon for this drink, though you should make sure that the drink you use has a relatively high proof so that its flavor isn\u2019t totally masked by that of the sambuca."

Shake the ingredients together and then use a strainer to strain them into a champagne flute. Finally, add a long, skinny lemon peel to the cocktail and then top the whole thing off with 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) of sparkling wine. Make sure you add the lemon peel before you add the sparkling wine, as pouring in the wine without the lemon peel already in the cocktail will cause it to bubble up too fast. You can also add a brandied cherry to the drink as a final garnish. You may see this drink referred to as a \u201cSambuca 75,\u201d as it\u2019s a variation of an established cocktail known as the \u201cFrench 75.\u201d"
