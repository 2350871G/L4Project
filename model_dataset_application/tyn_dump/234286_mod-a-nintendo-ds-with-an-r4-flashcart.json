The first one, Game, will allow you to load a .NDS file (a DS ROM, or a homebrew application - .NDS is to your DS what .EXE is to your Windows computer). The second one, Media, will allow you to play multimedia - music, video, text - using the Moonshell OS. The third one, Slot-2, will allow you to boot a Slot-2 (Game Boy Advance) game."
