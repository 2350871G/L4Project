          "description":"The size of the kiln depends on what you plan to fire in it. You can make a small or large kin depending on what kind of pottery you make. If you plan to fire multiple pieces at once, write down the combined width and length of those pieces. Then multiply each figure by 1.5 to determine the interior measurements of the kiln. For example, if you wish to fire 4 pieces at once that are each 1 ft (0.30 m) tall, 1 ft (0.30 m) wide, and 1 ft (0.30 m) long, multiply 1 ft (0.30 m) by 1.5 and the combined width and length (4 ft (1.2 m) and 4 ft (1.2 m)) by 1.5 to determine the depth of the kiln. If you\u2019re producing many pieces, consider putting multiple shelves in your kiln. Using shelves, you can build a taller and narrower kiln that can hold more pieces. Depending on the height, you may need to build a metal frame to bolster the walls."

Lay enough bricks to cover an area equal to the length and width of your kiln. These bricks will not only serve as your base layer, but also a shelf for your pottery.

If your sheet is made of cast iron, it is prone to rust easily. Make sure you remove it from the kiln and cover it when not in use to prevent damage from rain. Using Your Brick Kiln Put on a dust mask and coat the base of the kiln with sawdust. Coat the base with approximately 4 in (10 cm) \u2013 of sawdust. When you fire the kiln, the sawdust will give the pottery a polished finish. If your kiln includes multiple levels of shelving, go to the kiln\u2019s opening and place approximately 4 in (10 cm) of sawdust on each level of shelving. Load the kiln, starting with your pottery. Lay each piece on the bricks and space them evenly from each other and the walls. Make sure there is at least 1 in (2.5 cm) between each piece for best results. Individual pottery pieces should not touch each other. If you are unable to load the pottery without some pieces touching, place half of them at the kiln for an initial firing. Fire the rest later. Add newspaper and firewood to the kiln. Place 1 to 2 clumps of newspaper around the pottery. Fill the remaining gaps between the newspaper and the kilns walls with firewood. Make sure there are no gaps between the walls, firewood, newspaper, and pottery. As you grow more experienced with your kiln, experiment with different types of sawdust shavings, as well as where you place the sawdust, which will result in different finished effects. Light the kiln and let the fire burn for at least 24 hours. Crumple up and light a sheet of newspaper and place it in the kiln. The fire may burn up to 72 hours.
