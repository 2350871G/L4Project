Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Next, grease a 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray so the eggs won\u2019t stick. If you prefer, you can grease the muffin tin with butter or margarine."

Stir until the mixture is well combined. You can use any vegetables that you like in the eggs, such as mushrooms, greens, and/or tomatoes. Just make sure that you dice them so they\u2019re small enough to fit in the muffin tins. You can substitute another cheese in the muffins, such as swiss or pepper jack, or use a combination of two or more cheeses. If you want to make the egg muffins heartier, you can also mix cooked meat into the eggs. Sausage, bacon, and ham are all delicious options. Mixing frozen shredded hash browns into the egg mixture can help make more filling muffins too."
