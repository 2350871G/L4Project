The result is sweeter and more liquid than most frostings, so it is ideal on the top of cakes, or in the center of a cake cut into layers. It pairs especially well with light, fruit-flavored cakes, but might be overpowered by rich, thick cakes such as chocolate."

          "description":"You may measure out 2 cups of powdered sugar, or simply pour the amount you think will suit your needs. It is extremely easy to adjust this recipe or make more, so do not feel pressured to keep your measurements exact. Confectioner's sugar or icing sugar are simply other names for powdered sugar."

Measure out 4 tablespoons of the liquid, or simply pour in a small amount, much less than the amount of sugar used. It's better to add too little and add more later than to add too much and have to add a lot more sugar than you intended to use. If your cake contains fruit, consider adding juice made from that type of fruit. Consider picking a juice based on the color you want your cake to be."

          "headline":"Stir in a little more liquid at a time until there is no dry sugar visible.",
          "description":"Keep adding a little milk or juice at a time and stirring it in. When the mixture reaches an even consistency with no dry sugar on top of the paste, it is ready. Optionally, you may add a little more liquid to make the mixture thinner or to add more of the liquid's flavor. If the mixture becomes runny, however, stir in a little more sugar to compensate."

If you do not have a microwave, simply cut it into small pieces and leave it out on the counter. Either way, continue on once the butter is at room temperature and slightly soft, but not melted. If you will be serving the cake to vegans, replace the butter and whipped cream with a vegetable fat with rich flavor, such as cocoa butter or coconut fat. These tend to melt and solidify more quickly, which can make them difficult to work with. An easier alternative is margarine, but consider improving on its flavor by adding a small amount of melted vegan chocolate, maple syrup, or other strong-flavored ingredient."
