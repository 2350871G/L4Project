Wearing rubber gloves will protect you from potentially harmful bacteria and allow you to work more confidently while you go about replacing your toilet seat. Disposable gloves are inexpensive and provide an effective barrier against germs, but they can be prone to tearing or splitting if they get snagged. If you\u2019re a germaphobe, consider going with a thick pair of work gloves instead.

Use an appropriately-sized flat-blade screwdriver to loosen the bolt.If necessary, hold the wingnut securing the bottom of the mounting bolt steady with your free hand while you unscrew the bolt from the top. These wingnuts are accessible from the underside of the toilet on either edge. Getting your old seat out of the way will also make it easier for you to measure for your new seat.Tip: Some older toilets have metal mounting hardware that can become hopelessly stuck after years of rust and corrosion.
