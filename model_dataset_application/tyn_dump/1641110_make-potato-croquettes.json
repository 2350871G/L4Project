Boil them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they turn tender. Drain the potatoes, then let them chill for about 45 minutes. This not only helps dry the potatoes, but also firms them up a little. Mash the potatoes using a fork or potato masher. Don't worry about making them perfectly smooth. You actually want there to be some lumps and clumps. Mix in the cheeses, onion salt, parsley, pepper, and salt using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined. Remember to go easy on the salt because the onion salt will already have added some saltiness. Beat one egg in a small bowl lightly, then stir it into the potato mixture. Do not add the other two eggs; you will be using them for coating the croquettes. Roll the potato mixture into 24 croquettes. You will need about \u00bc cup (80 grams) for each croquette. Roll the croquettes into oval-shaped balls first, then lightly flatten them with your palm. You don't want them to be completely flat. They should be plump, but flat enough so that they don't roll around. Chill the croquettes in the fridge for 15 to 30 minutes. Place the croquettes onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper or parchment paper, then transfer them to the fridge. This will help firm the potato mixture up and prevent it from falling apart while frying. Lightly beat the remaining two eggs in a shallow dish using a fork or mini whisk.  Put the breadcrumbs into another shallow dish.  Dip each croquette into the egg mixture, the dredge it through the breadcrumbs. Make sure that you coat both sides of each croquette evenly, and that you let any excess egg mixture drip off before you move onto the breadcrumbs. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.

Making Korokke or Japanese Potato Croquettes Boil the potatoes in a large pot of water. Place the potatoes (peeled and cut) into a large pot, and fill it with enough water to cover the potatoes. Bring the water to a boil, then cook the potatoes until they become tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the water from the potatoes, then let them sit in the pot over low heat until the moisture evaporates. Don't let the potatoes burn. Letting the water evaporate will keep the potatoes from getting too soggy. Mash the potatoes roughly using a fork or potato masher. Don't worry about making them perfectly smooth.

You just want the dry, beef-and-onion mixture. It might be a good idea to put the beef-and-onion mixture into a strainer to drain out any liquid before adding it to the mashed potatoes.
