          "description":"Before you get started, take the time to remove any furniture or other obstacles from your work area and cover the floor with a layer of protective material. Make sure your floor cover extends all the way along the bottom part of the wall. If you like, you can use painter's tape to secure the edges and keep dripping paint from finding its way onto the floor. If possible, use a tarp or dropcloth that\u2019s roughly the same length as the wall or ceiling you\u2019re applying paint to. If your floor cover is on the small side, you\u2019ll need to pause periodically and slide it down as you proceed to a new section. Newspapers and old bed sheets can also make good paint catchers if you don\u2019t own a tarp or dropcloth. A tarp or dropcloth will do a good job of protecting your floor from wayward paint. To protect yourself, change into some old clothes that you don't mind dirtying up, and crack a window or leave a fan running to help ventilate your work space."

          "headline":"Tape off any parts of the wall that you don\u2019t want to paint.",
          "description":"Place strips of tape along the outer edges of the baseboards and trim, as well as any wall fixtures, light switches, and electrical outlets. That way, you can focus on applying the paint without having to worry about getting it anywhere it\u2019s not supposed to be. Painter\u2019s tape comes in various widths, including 0.94 in (2.4 cm), 1.41 in (3.6 cm), and 1.88 in (4.8 cm). If you\u2019re looking for a one-size-fits-all tape, medium-widths like 1.41 in (3.6 cm) and 1.88 in (4.8 cm) tend to work well. They\u2019ll allow for neat edge work without covering too much of the surface you want to paint or too little of the trim you want to protect."

          "headline":"Roll on a coat of interior latex primer before painting your topcoats.",
          "description":"While applying your primer, aim for a uniform coat of moderate thickness to prepare the surface to hold paint. A good primer will promote proper adhesion, protect against moisture and stains, bring out the color of your paint, and, in many cases, let you get away with using only a single topcoat. Mix a splash of your chosen paint shade in with the primer to more closely approximate the tone you have in mind for the finished surface. You have the option of either using the same roller for both priming and painting (remembering to clean the cover thoroughly with warm, soapy water between applications) or changing out your roller covers to save time."

          "description":"Use your brush to apply a thick, even coat of whatever paint you\u2019re using to the area around the baseboards, trim, corners and top of the wall or crown molding. Tackling hard-to-reach spots with a brush will allow you to work neatly and quickly with a minimum number of mistakes. A 1\u20132 \u20442 in (2.5\u20136.4 cm) angled brush will offer the best balance of speed, maneuverability, and control."

          "headline":"Select a roller that\u2019s 9 inches (23 cm) or longer for faster, fuller application.",
          "description":"Paint rollers come in a wide range of sizes, and can reach up to 18 inches (46 cm) in length. You\u2019ll be able to coat far more of your surface per stroke with a larger applicator than you could with a more compact 4 in (10 cm) roller. Just be sure to use a paint tray that\u2019s roomy enough to accommodate the roller size you\u2019re working with. If you\u2019re painting high walls or ceilings, fit your roller with an extendable handle to spare yourself the headache of constantly repositioning a ladder. Choose your tools wisely, especially if you\u2019re an inexperienced painter. While 12 in (30 cm) rollers can cut down significantly on your total application time, their added length and weight can also make them harder to control around corners, trim, and other tricky areas. A roller cover with a \u20444\u2013\u20448 in (0.64\u20130.95 cm) nap height will be most suitable for smooth or lightly-textured surfaces, while a \u20448\u2013\u20444 in (0.95\u20131.91 cm) nap is better equipped for handling ceilings."

          "headline":"Fill a paint tray with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of paint in your preferred shade.",
          "description":"Pour in enough paint to keep your roller loaded throughout the painting process, but not so much that it will be at risk of drying out. You can always add more paint to the tray as needed while you work. Keep your paint tray covered with a sheet of plastic wrap or aluminum foil when you\u2019re not using it. This will prevent the upper surface from partially drying into a rubbery film, which can end up on your walls if you\u2019re not careful. Mixing in a small amount of chemical extender or conditioner will also keep your paint wet longer and help you cut down on time-consuming stirring and re-pours. When left uncovered and untreated, 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fresh paint will only last 1-2 hours in an open tray before drying out."

        {
          "headline":"Roll the roller through the paint to load it.",
          "description":"Lower the roller into the deepest part of the tray, then move it back and forth until the nap is covered all the way around. Before you actually begin painting, drag the roller over the raised ridges at the foot of the tray to remove excess paint. Be careful not to oversaturate your roller. By doing so, you could leave behind unsightly drip marks on the surface. If you don\u2019t have a paint tray, transfer your paint to a 5 gallons (19 L) bucket and slide in a removable paint screen."

Repeat this zig-zag pattern until you\u2019ve coated every part of the surface within arm's reach. Afterwards, go back over any spots you might have missed or places where the color looks thinner. This technique provides the best possible coverage on broad, flat areas like walls and ceilings.Tip: To spread the paint out as far as possible without missing giant swaths, it can help to imagine that you\u2019re drawing a giant upper-case \u201cN\u201d or \u201cW\u201d on the surface."

After completing a section, pause to check your coverage, then move onto the next. Continue in this fashion until you\u2019ve painted the entire surface. When painting walls, roll the full height of the wall in each section to avoid creating seams. If you happen to notice any spots that you missed, go back over them by hand using a soft-bristle brush. Be careful not to use too much paint, or your touched-up sections may run."

Otherwise, wait 3-4 hours before rolling on an additional coat to achieve greater depth of color. Hold off on touch-testing or otherwise handling the paint until it's had adequate time to dry. You'll rarely need to use more than 2 coats on an interior surface."

At the very least, pull on a long-sleeved shirt and pants, a pair of disposable rubber gloves, and some safety glasses or goggles. If you have sensitive airways, you may also want to strap on a facemask or ventilator to avoid breathing irritating fumes. Most types of paint can be laundered out of clothing fairly easily. Still, it\u2019s a good idea to change into a set of clothes you don\u2019t care to get paint on, just in case. A cheap pair of coveralls can make a good investment if you have a big project ahead of you or find yourself tackling painting tasks frequently."

This might include things like plants, shrubs, air conditioning units, lawn fixtures, or decor pieces. If you only have one or two tarps, you may need to move them around with you as you work your way around to different parts of the structure.

Taking the time to stir your paint and filter out debris will help minimize clogging, which is a common issue with paint sprayers. You can get away with skipping the straining phase if you\u2019re using a fresh can of paint, but don\u2019t proceed without stirring. This small preliminary step can make a big difference when it comes to ease of application and final coverage. If your work surface hasn\u2019t yet been primed, fill the sprayer with an appropriate type of primer instead and apply a uniform coat. You can then go on to repeat the process described here using your primary shade of paint."

Sprayers are best suited for painting large exterior surfaces, especially those with rough or irregular textures that would be difficult to hit with a roller. You can also save yourself some time and labor by using a sprayer to paint interior walls or even whole rooms, though the risk of drips and splatters will be greater than with a roller or brush."

To guarantee a uniform finish, always keep the nozzle of the sprayer perpendicular to the surface you\u2019re painting. The closer you bring the sprayer to the surface, the more likely you are to create drips, overly thick spots, and other imperfections.

Once the line is primed, the nozzle will emit a pressurized stream of paint that will settle onto your surface in a thin, even layer. The sprayer will release paint continuously while the trigger remains engaged. If you\u2019ve never worked with a paint sprayer, practice on a disposable surface, like a sheet of cardboard or plywood, before jumping into the real thing. This will give you a chance to get used to the force and trajectory of the spray and get a feel for maneuvering the sprayer. If your sprayer features adjustable pressure settings, play around with them to find the configuration that works best for the task at hand. A narrower spray width, for example, will offer more control and help you paint neater lines and edges, while a wider arc will allow you to cover more of the surface at once."

Then, move over and begin your next section by overlapping the edges of the neighboring section. This technique will help ensure a seamless coat. Alternatively, you can use lateral strokes to paint structures with horizontal siding or especially long walls. When spraying with a side-to-side motion, work in vertical sections of approximately 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m). It may also be easier to use horizontal strokes if you're forced to stand on a ladder to reach the upper part of your surface. That way, you get the hard part out of the way first, then climb down and finish the lower part of the surface from ground level.Tip: No matter what direction you\u2019re spraying in, it\u2019s important to keep the sprayer moving constantly.

    "If possible, use a tarp or dropcloth that\u2019s roughly the same length as the wall or ceiling you\u2019re applying paint to.",
    "If your floor cover is on the small side, you\u2019ll need to pause periodically and slide it down as you proceed to a new section.",
    "Newspapers and old bed sheets can also make good paint catchers if you don\u2019t own a tarp or dropcloth.",
    "A tarp or dropcloth will do a good job of protecting your floor from wayward paint.",
    "To protect yourself, change into some old clothes that you don't mind dirtying up, and crack a window or leave a fan running to help ventilate your work space.",
    "Tape off any parts of the wall that you don\u2019t want to paint.",
    "Place strips of tape along the outer edges of the baseboards and trim, as well as any wall fixtures, light switches, and electrical outlets.",
    "That way, you can focus on applying the paint without having to worry about getting it anywhere it\u2019s not supposed to be.",
    "Painter\u2019s tape comes in various widths, including 0.94 in (2.4 cm), 1.41 in (3.6 cm), and 1.88 in (4.8 cm).",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a one-size-fits-all tape, medium-widths like 1.41 in (3.6 cm) and 1.88 in (4.8 cm) tend to work well.",
    "They\u2019ll allow for neat edge work without covering too much of the surface you want to paint or too little of the trim you want to protect.",
    "Roll on a coat of interior latex primer before painting your topcoats.",
    "While applying your primer, aim for a uniform coat of moderate thickness to prepare the surface to hold paint.",
    "A good primer will promote proper adhesion, protect against moisture and stains, bring out the color of your paint, and, in many cases, let you get away with using only a single topcoat.",
    "Mix a splash of your chosen paint shade in with the primer to more closely approximate the tone you have in mind for the finished surface.",
    "You have the option of either using the same roller for both priming and painting (remembering to clean the cover thoroughly with warm, soapy water between applications) or changing out your roller covers to save time.",
    "Paint around the outer edges of the surface with a handheld trim brush first.",
    "Use your brush to apply a thick, even coat of whatever paint you\u2019re using to the area around the baseboards, trim, corners and top of the wall or crown molding.",
    "Tackling hard-to-reach spots with a brush will allow you to work neatly and quickly with a minimum number of mistakes.",
    "A 1\u20132 \u20442 in (2.5\u20136.4 cm) angled brush will offer the best balance of speed, maneuverability, and control.",
    "Select a roller that\u2019s 9 inches (23 cm) or longer for faster, fuller application.",
    "Paint rollers come in a wide range of sizes, and can reach up to 18 inches (46 cm) in length.",
    "You\u2019ll be able to coat far more of your surface per stroke with a larger applicator than you could with a more compact 4 in (10 cm) roller.",
    "Just be sure to use a paint tray that\u2019s roomy enough to accommodate the roller size you\u2019re working with.",
    "If you\u2019re painting high walls or ceilings, fit your roller with an extendable handle to spare yourself the headache of constantly repositioning a ladder.",
    "Choose your tools wisely, especially if you\u2019re an inexperienced painter.",
    "While 12 in (30 cm) rollers can cut down significantly on your total application time, their added length and weight can also make them harder to control around corners, trim, and other tricky areas.",
    "A roller cover with a \u20444\u2013\u20448 in (0.64\u20130.95 cm) nap height will be most suitable for smooth or lightly-textured surfaces, while a \u20448\u2013\u20444 in (0.95\u20131.91 cm) nap is better equipped for handling ceilings.",
    "Fill a paint tray with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of paint in your preferred shade.",
    "Pour in enough paint to keep your roller loaded throughout the painting process, but not so much that it will be at risk of drying out.",
    "You can always add more paint to the tray as needed while you work.",
    "Keep your paint tray covered with a sheet of plastic wrap or aluminum foil when you\u2019re not using it.",
    "This will prevent the upper surface from partially drying into a rubbery film, which can end up on your walls if you\u2019re not careful.",
    "Mixing in a small amount of chemical extender or conditioner will also keep your paint wet longer and help you cut down on time-consuming stirring and re-pours.",
    "When left uncovered and untreated, 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fresh paint will only last 1-2 hours in an open tray before drying out.",
    "Roll the roller through the paint to load it.",
    "Lower the roller into the deepest part of the tray, then move it back and forth until the nap is covered all the way around.",
    "Before you actually begin painting, drag the roller over the raised ridges at the foot of the tray to remove excess paint.",
    "Be careful not to oversaturate your roller.",
    "By doing so, you could leave behind unsightly drip marks on the surface.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a paint tray, transfer your paint to a 5 gallons (19 L) bucket and slide in a removable paint screen.",
    "Glide the roller over the surface you\u2019re painting with loose overlapping strokes.",
    "Push the roller up at a diagonal angle, then pull it back down in the opposite direction.",
    "Repeat this zig-zag pattern until you\u2019ve coated every part of the surface within arm's reach.",
    "Afterwards, go back over any spots you might have missed or places where the color looks thinner.",
    "This technique provides the best possible coverage on broad, flat areas like walls and ceilings.Tip: To spread the paint out as far as possible without missing giant swaths, it can help to imagine that you\u2019re drawing a giant upper-case \u201cN\u201d or \u201cW\u201d on the surface.",
    "Work your way across the surface in 3\u20134 feet (0.91\u20131.22 m) sections.",
    "To make your strokes feel more natural, work from left to right if you\u2019re right-handed and right to left if you\u2019re left-handed.",
    "After completing a section, pause to check your coverage, then move onto the next.",
    "Continue in this fashion until you\u2019ve painted the entire surface.",
    "When painting walls, roll the full height of the wall in each section to avoid creating seams.",
    "If you happen to notice any spots that you missed, go back over them by hand using a soft-bristle brush.",
    "Be careful not to use too much paint, or your touched-up sections may run.",
    "Allow the paint to dry and apply a follow-up coat if necessary.",
    "If your topcoat shows up well on top of your primer and you're satisfied with its appearance, all that's left to do is leave it to dry overnight, or long enough to set securely.",
    "Otherwise, wait 3-4 hours before rolling on an additional coat to achieve greater depth of color.",
    "Hold off on touch-testing or otherwise handling the paint until it's had adequate time to dry.",
    "You'll rarely need to use more than 2 coats on an interior surface.",
    "Spraying Exterior Surfaces Wear long-sleeved clothing, gloves, and eye protection.",
    "Things can get a little messy when you\u2019re wielding a paint sprayer.",
    "For this reason, it\u2019s recommended that you cover as much exposed skin as possible.",
    "At the very least, pull on a long-sleeved shirt and pants, a pair of disposable rubber gloves, and some safety glasses or goggles.",
    "If you have sensitive airways, you may also want to strap on a facemask or ventilator to avoid breathing irritating fumes.",
    "Most types of paint can be laundered out of clothing fairly easily.",
    "Still, it\u2019s a good idea to change into a set of clothes you don\u2019t care to get paint on, just in case.",
    "A cheap pair of coveralls can make a good investment if you have a big project ahead of you or find yourself tackling painting tasks frequently.",
    "Use tarps to shield any exterior features you won\u2019t want to get paint on.",
    "Drape a plastic or canvas tarp over any items in the immediate vicinity of the structure you\u2019ll be refinishing that could be ruined by the drifting paint spray.",
    "This might include things like plants, shrubs, air conditioning units, lawn fixtures, or decor pieces.",
    "If you only have one or two tarps, you may need to move them around with you as you work your way around to different parts of the structure.",
    "Plastic sheeting is also an effective and inexpensive way to protect against overspray and keep paint away from places where it\u2019s not supposed to be.",
    "Stir and strain your paint to make sure it has a uniform consistency.",
    "Crack open a can of the paint you want to use and use a paint stirrer stick to mix it thoroughly, making sure you get all the way down to the bottom of the can.",
    "When you\u2019re done, stretch a mesh paint strainer over the opening of a separate bucket and pour the paint into the bucket slowly.",
    "Taking the time to stir your paint and filter out debris will help minimize clogging, which is a common issue with paint sprayers.",
    "You can get away with skipping the straining phase if you\u2019re using a fresh can of paint, but don\u2019t proceed without stirring.",
    "This small preliminary step can make a big difference when it comes to ease of application and final coverage.",
    "If your work surface hasn\u2019t yet been primed, fill the sprayer with an appropriate type of primer instead and apply a uniform coat.",
    "You can then go on to repeat the process described here using your primary shade of paint.",
    "Fill the chamber of your sprayer with the freshly-stirred paint.",
    "Pour the paint in up to the indicated fill line, using a funnel if necessary to prevent spills.",
    "Then, place the lid back on the chamber, or reconnect it to the sprayer unit as directed.",
    "Make sure the connection between the paint chamber and the sprayer is secure.",
    "Sprayers are best suited for painting large exterior surfaces, especially those with rough or irregular textures that would be difficult to hit with a roller.",
    "You can also save yourself some time and labor by using a sprayer to paint interior walls or even whole rooms, though the risk of drips and splatters will be greater than with a roller or brush.",
    "Hold the nozzle of the sprayer 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) away from the surface.",
    "This will put you in the best range to ensure an optimal balance between coverage and depth of color.",
    "Do your best to maintain this same distance the entire time that you\u2019re spraying, including at the ends of your strokes.",
    "To guarantee a uniform finish, always keep the nozzle of the sprayer perpendicular to the surface you\u2019re painting.",
    "The closer you bring the sprayer to the surface, the more likely you are to create drips, overly thick spots, and other imperfections.",
    "Conversely, moving the sprayer too far away will reduce your overall coverage while increasing the risk of messy overspray.",
    "Press and hold the trigger of the sprayer to begin applying the paint.",
    "It may take a moment for the device\u2019s internal suction to pull the paint into the line and \u201cprime\u201d it for use.",
    "Once the line is primed, the nozzle will emit a pressurized stream of paint that will settle onto your surface in a thin, even layer.",
    "The sprayer will release paint continuously while the trigger remains engaged.",
    "If you\u2019ve never worked with a paint sprayer, practice on a disposable surface, like a sheet of cardboard or plywood, before jumping into the real thing.",
    "This will give you a chance to get used to the force and trajectory of the spray and get a feel for maneuvering the sprayer.",
    "If your sprayer features adjustable pressure settings, play around with them to find the configuration that works best for the task at hand.",
    "A narrower spray width, for example, will offer more control and help you paint neater lines and edges, while a wider arc will allow you to cover more of the surface at once.",
    "Spray the surface you\u2019re painting in 1\u20132 ft (0.30\u20130.61 m) sections.",
    "Start at or near the center of the surface and guide the sprayer up and down along its entire height using slow, smooth motions.",
    "Then, move over and begin your next section by overlapping the edges of the neighboring section.",
    "This technique will help ensure a seamless coat.",
    "Alternatively, you can use lateral strokes to paint structures with horizontal siding or especially long walls.",
    "When spraying with a side-to-side motion, work in vertical sections of approximately 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m).",
    "It may also be easier to use horizontal strokes if you're forced to stand on a ladder to reach the upper part of your surface.",
    "That way, you get the hard part out of the way first, then climb down and finish the lower part of the surface from ground level.Tip: No matter what direction you\u2019re spraying in, it\u2019s important to keep the sprayer moving constantly.",
    "Otherwise, the paint will begin to build up quickly, which can result in a splotchy, uneven coat.",
    "Let your paint dry for at least 1-2 hours before applying additional coats.",
    "Sprayers produce thin, even coats that dry much faster than the heavy coats created by brushes and rollers.",
    "After a couple of hours, the paint on your surface should have cured enough to withstand the elements or accept a follow-up coat or quick round of touch-ups.",
    "Keep in mind that environmental factors like moisture and drastic fluctuations in temperature can increase the drying time of exterior paints.",
    "To avoid drips and other inconsistencies, it's best not to apply more than 2 coats total."
