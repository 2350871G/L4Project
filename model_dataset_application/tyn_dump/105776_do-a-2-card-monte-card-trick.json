Do a double lift and show the ace of diamonds and say, \"Diamond.\" (To give you some time to get a double lift ready, ask the spectator what card he has and to look at it to make sure it is ok.) Place the diamond with the queen behind it on top of the deck and give the spectator the queen which he thinks is the diamond. Place this on top of the ace of hearts. Say, \"I will teach you the move in slow motion.\" Put the queen on top take the heart from underneath, and turn it around to show the spectator and say, \"See, I have the heart.\"  Shove the heart between the spectator's fingers fast.
