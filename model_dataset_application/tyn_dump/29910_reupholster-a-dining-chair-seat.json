Interior designer Katherine Tlapa says: \"To reupholster a dining room chair, first you'll need to disassemble the cushion, or the upholstered parts. Some dining chairs have seats that can be screwed off, while others are attached. If you can't take the cushion off, you'll need to neatly tuck the fabric around the edges, then add something that will conceal the seams, such as roping or fabric beading.\""
