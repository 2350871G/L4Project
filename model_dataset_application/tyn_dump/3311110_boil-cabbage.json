Green cabbage: The classic green cabbage has wide fan-like leaves that have a waxy rubber feel when raw. It has a sweet taste when cooked but can taste quite peppery when eaten raw. White cabbage is a type of green cabbage which is a bit mushier when cooked, so extra care needs to be taken of this variety during cooking, to keep it firm and flavorful. Red cabbage: It's known for its dark reddish-purple leaves and have a deeper flavour than green cabbage. It's often used for pickling and adding colour to dishes. Savoy cabbage: This cabbage has a softer and crinkly feel to it with deep greens and white veins. It's high in vitamin K, vitamin C, and fiber and has a mild earthy taste to it. Napa cabbage: This cabbage comes in an oblong shape and looks closely like romaine lettuce with its yellow greenish leaves and prominent white stems. It tastes much sweeter when raw than green cabbages. Bok choy: A traditional Chinese cabbage, bok choy is light and peppery or bitter to taste. When cooked, the white stems remain crisp while its leaves become soft. It is also quite watery compared to most cabbages."
