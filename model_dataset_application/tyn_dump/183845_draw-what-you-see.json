    "Paper: any sketch pad in the size of your choice will do. Newsprint is extremely thin and will deteriorate easily so you will probably want something thicker. When you purchase the paper, feel a sheet between your fingers. If you want to do marker drawing you will need very thick paper - it should feel like poster board.",
    "If you are drawing geometric objects rather than the natural outdoors, you may want to buy some templates and a small ruler. The ruler should be no larger than your paper size. Templates are usually plastic sheets with circle, squares, triangles, and other shapes cut out so you can trace them.",
    "Buy a \"triangle\" - literally a triangular sheet of plastic - for making 90 degree angles. This can be found in math tool sets, along with compasses."
