          "description":"The first step in building the hideout of your dreams is to find the perfect location. Look all around your house for areas that have the space and privacy you need. An attic or basement would be perfect, since they\u2019ll be out of plain sight. You could also put your hideout in your own bedroom, or right in the middle of the living room. Putting your hideout in the family room is a good way to get a little more privacy without being too far away from the things you want to do. Depending on the weather, you might be able to build a hideout outside. Just make sure you\u2019re somewhere near your house where it\u2019s safe, and be sure to hurry inside if it looks like it might rain."

        {
          "headline":"Gather your building materials.",
          "description":"Next, you\u2019ll need stuff to build the hideout with. Grab as many blankets, sheets and/or beach towels as you can find. These will go on the outside of your hideout. For the rest of the structure, you can create a cozy nook with pillows or couch cushions, or you might use sturdier materials if you want your hideout to be more reinforced. Things like cardboard or plywood will help you put together a longer-lasting structure. Unused cardboard boxes make good building materials. They even fold up flat when you want to dismantle your hideout. If you want it to build a quick and easy hideout, drape your blankets over a table or desk."

          "description":"Put some thought into designing your hideout. Start by getting the outside in order, then lay out the inside however you want. Your hideout could be tall with a pointed roof (using a broomstick as a support), or it might be lower to the ground so that you have to crawl on your stomach to get in. Get creative! You can make almost anything you imagine a reality. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. You could make a good hideout only using the things on your bed. Take advantage of the space you have. No hideout is too big or too small."

          "headline":"Put up your supports.",
          "description":"Now it\u2019s time to actually start setting up your hideout. Use furniture like the couch, the chairs from the dinner table or the laundry drying rack as your main foundation. You'll need at least four pieces of furniture to serve as the corners of the structure, and one in the center to keep the roof from collapsing if its really big. The most important thing is to have some way to stabilize your hideout so it doesn\u2019t fall in on you. Space out your supports so you have room to move around inside the hideout."

Make sure you leave a hole in one side so that you can get in and out. Fitted sheets work nicely for building hideouts and forts. Their elastic edges will stretch around your supports and hold the sheet in place. Hold sheets and blankets together with masking tape, clothespins or potato chip bag clips."
