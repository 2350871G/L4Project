Rinse the teapot out with hot water and place the tea leaves or bags into it. Fill the teapot with hot water and let the tea steep for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on how strong you like it. Stir the tea and serve it. If you used loose leaf tea, you'll need to strain it when pouring it into your guest's cup. Avoid squeezing the tea bags with your spoon. This will make the tea bitter."

These should be bite-sized so your guests can just nibble as they sip their tea. Offer your guests tiny sandwiches, scones, and pastries. For finger sandwiches, consider serving cucumber and cream cheese, sliced tomato and watercress, or chicken salad sandwiches with the crusts trimmed. Consider serving a variety of miniature sweet scones that you can serve with clotted cream, jam, or citrus curds. You can buy or make small pastries and baked goods like shortbread, macarons, or tea cake."

Give the cup to your guest and let them serve themselves food. You can drink your tea once you've served all of your guests. Consider offering alternative milks or sugars for your guests. For example, offer soy milk or almond milk instead of cow's milk. You can also offer honey or stevia instead of granulated sugar."

Pu-erh and red tea are the strongest teas (both fermented), while green tea is the least processed. White tea (which is only mildly fermented) and Oolong have mild, light flavors.

It's important to use a different pot for each type of tea, since the clay of the teapot absorbs some of the tea's essence. Chinese teapots (called Yixing teapots) are smaller than Western teapots and made of unglazed clay.
