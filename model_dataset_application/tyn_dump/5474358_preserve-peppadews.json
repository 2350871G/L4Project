    "Slice the stem end of each Piquant\u00e9 Pepper, then use a small spoon to dig out the cores and seeds.",
    "Blanch for 3 minutes.",
    "Boil water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.",
    "Submerge the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers and allow them to simmer for 3 minutes.",
    "As the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers sit in the boiling water, prepare a large bowl of ice water for the next step.",
    "Dunk in cold water.",
    "Immediately transfer the blanched Piquant\u00e9 Peppers to the bowl of prepared ice water.",
    "Allow them to sit for 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Dunking the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers in ice water will stop the cooking process and allow them to maintain a better color and texture.",
    "Drain the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers thoroughly by pouring the contents of the ice water bowl through a colander.",
    "Pack the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers into jars.",
    "Spoon the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers into half-pint (250-ml) or pint (500-ml) glass canning jars.",
    "Leave the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers whole as you pack them.",
    "To save space, you may wish to flatten them before packing them.",
    "Do so by lightly pressing on the side with the bottom of a spoon.",
    "The jars must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before you use them.",
    "Cover with boiling water.",
    "Pour boiling water over the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers, filling each jar until only 1 inch (2.5 ml) of headspace remains.",
    "You can use the boiling water leftover from when you blanched the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers or use freshly boiled water from a kettle.",
    "Either option is acceptable.",
    "Add the salt and lemon juice.",
    "Add 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of lemon juice to each pint (500-ml) jar.",
    "If using half-pint (250-ml) jars, add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of salt and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) of lemon juice to each one.",
    "After adding the salt and lemon juice, run a plastic knife or spatula in between the Piquant\u00e9 Peppers and the jar.",
    "Doing so mixes the salt and lemon juice into the water while also removing trapped air bubbles.",
    "Process in a pressure canner.",
    "For non-pickled Piquant\u00e9 Peppers, a pressure canner is strongly recommended due to the low acid content of the vegetable.",
    "Process the jars of Piquant\u00e9 Peppers for 35 minutes.",
    "Wipe the jar rims using a clean, damp cloth and make sure that the lids and ring bands are tightly secured before processing.",
    "The proper pressure setting will vary depending on the type of canner used and the altitude you are positioned at.",
    "For dial gauge canners:\nAt 0 to 2000 ft (0 to 610 m), the pressure should be set to 11 lbs (75 KPa).",
    "At 2001 to 4000 ft (611 to 1220 m), the pressure should be set to 12 lbs (82 KPa).",
    "At 4001 to 6000 ft (1221 to 1830 m), the pressure should be set to 13 lbs (89 KPa).",
    "At 6001 to 8000 ft (1831 to 2440 m), the pressure should be set to 14 lbs (95 KPa).",
    "For weighted gauge canners:\nAt 0 to 1000 ft (0 to 305 m), the pressure should be set to 10 lbs (68 KPa).",
    "Above 1000 ft (305 m), the pressure should be set to 15 lb (102 KPa).",
    "Allow the canner to air cool until it depressurizes.",
    "Open the canner slowly and lift the jars out with a jar lifter.",
    "Let the jars to air cool for 12 to 24 hours on a dish towel or cooling rack.",
    "Check the jars when cool.",
    "An indented lid signifies a proper seal.",
    "Jars that did not seal properly should be stored in the refrigerator and used within several weeks.",
    "Store until needed.",
    "Store the canned Piquant\u00e9 Peppers in a cool, dry, dark place.",
    "They can be opened and consumed immediately, but they should last for a year or longer if properly sealed.",
    "Storage temperatures should not exceed 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24.1 degrees Celsius).",
    "After opening a jar or preserved Piquant\u00e9 Peppers, keep that jar in the refrigerator."
