Keep in mind that you can always trim off the excess ric rac. The wider the ric rac, the bigger the rose will be. If you want a small rose, use thin ric rac. If you want a larger rose, use wider ric rac. Your rose can be any color you want. Pink, red, and white are great choices, but why not try baby blue, light purple, or even rainbow?"
