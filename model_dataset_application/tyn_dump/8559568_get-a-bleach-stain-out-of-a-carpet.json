Run a towel or cloth under cold water, squeeze it out, then use it to blot out the affected area. Take care to blot with repeated dabbing motions instead of scrubbing. Scrubbing will force the bleach deeper into the carpet fibers. Make sure to use a white towel or one that you don\u2019t mind getting stained."

The best thing about using interior paint is that you can take some carpet fibers to your local home improvement store and have them match the color precisely.
