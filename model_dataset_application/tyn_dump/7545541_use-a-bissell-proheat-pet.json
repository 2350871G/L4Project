    "Most Bissell water tanks have an interior compartment that is for the clean water, and the dirty water gets sucked up into a compartment that surrounds the clean one.",
    "You may also need to clean or wipe off the red filter that is underneath the water tank.",
    "If that is clogged, the dirty water won\u2019t be able to get sucked up into the tank.",
    "Make sure the cleaner is reclined if the brush roll isn\u2019t moving.",
    "If you try to operate the Bissell while it\u2019s in an upright position, it won\u2019t work.",
    "Use your foot to release the upright part of the cleaner so it\u2019s in a reclined position.",
    "The reclined position also makes it a lot easier to push and pull back and forth.",
    "You can also check the brush roll to see if something is stuck in it, like an elastic, a big clump of dirt, or something else.",
    "The roll should spin easily when you move it by hand\u2014if it doesn\u2019t, that means something is lodged in there.",
    "Clean the front nozzle and bristles if they are clogged.",
    "The front nozzle is the section that both releases water and sucks it back up.",
    "Sometimes it can get clogged and prevent the machine from doing what it\u2019s supposed to.",
    "Lift the piece of plastic that covers the bristles.",
    "Use the provided brush cleaner to wipe away dirt that is attached to the bristles, and rinse the plastic in warm water before replacing it.",
    "You may notice that it takes longer for your cleaner to suck up dirty water than it used to.",
    "This is a common result of the nozzle or bristles getting weighed down with dirt."
