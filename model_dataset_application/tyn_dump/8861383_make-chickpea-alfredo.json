  "text":" Soaking the Nuts Cover the cashews with water. Place \u2153 cup (50 g) of unsalted raw cashews in a small bowl. Pour enough boiling water over the nuts to cover them completely. Make sure that the water is boiling so it\u2019s hot enough to soften the cashews. Soak the cashews. Once the cashews are covered with the hot water, place a small plate over the bowl to cover it.
