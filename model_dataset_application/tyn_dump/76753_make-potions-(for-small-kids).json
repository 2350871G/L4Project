Have the kids make their potions on a large tray, like a baking sheet, so that the fizz will be contained easily.

For example, you could put the dishwashing soap into a glass vial and label it \u201cenchanted syrup.\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t have liquid dishwashing soap, you could also use shavings of bar soap for the same effect.

    "Then have them add the cotton balls to their containers until most of the water is absorbed.",
    "They may need to use a spoon or wooden stick to poke the cotton down all the way.",
    "Make sure to use cotton balls rather than cotton swabs.",
    "The swabs are too concentrated and won\u2019t create the same effect in the jar.",
    "Pour more water into the jar and add a different color of paint.",
    "Once the majority of the first layer of water and paint has been absorbed by cotton balls, add more water until the jar is 2/3 of the way full, and add in about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of a different color of paint.",
    "For example, if your first layer was dark blue, make the second layer pink.",
    "Use a spoon or wooden stick to gently mix together the second layer of water and paint.",
    "Repeat the glitter, cotton, water, and paint steps until your jar is full.",
    "Soak up that second layer of paint and glitter with stretched out cotton balls, and then create a third layer with another color of paint and repeat the process.",
    "When you\u2019re done, the jar should resemble a multi-colored, glittery galaxy.",
    "You could even give the jar a few quick shakes to slightly mix together the colors for a more integrated look.",
    "Tighten the lid on your jar and use it as your galaxy potion when playing.",
    "This is a great potion to have if you like to play \u201cscientist.\u201d You can leave it closed up, or your kids could even open it up and take out some of the cotton to add some \u201cgalaxy\u201d to their other potions.",
    "If you\u2019re sending galaxy potion jars home with kids for gifts, make sure the lids are screwed on really tight.",
    "Also, you could write each kid\u2019s name on the bottom of the jar in permanent marker so they don\u2019t mix up which galaxy belongs to which kid.",
    "Mixing Color-Changing Potions Prepare your workstation before starting your potion making.",
    "You will need 4 glass containers for each kid, baking soda, white vinegar, and spoons.",
    "You can also put the containers on a baking tray so that any potential mess will be easily contained.",
    "Use containers that have lids so your kids can save the potions to play with again later.",
    "Make cabbage water by boiling a cabbage and steeping it for 30 minutes.",
    "You can use any size of cabbage for this process.",
    "Simply put it into a pot on the stove, add enough water to cover the cabbage, let it come to a boil, and then remove it from the heat and let it sit for 30 minutes.",
    "After 30 minutes, pour the water in a jar, passing it through a sieve first.",
    "No need to cut up the cabbage!",
    "You can boil it whole.",
    "Pour the cabbage water into 4 different glass containers.",
    "In the first container, fill it up all the way with cabbage water.",
    "In the second container, fill it 3/4 of the way full.",
    "In the third container, fill it 1/2 way with the cabbage water, and in the fourth container, only fill it 1/4 of the way full.",
    "Your cabbage water may be blue or it may be pink!",
    "Either way, the experiment will work.",
    "Add water to dilute the cabbage water in the last 3 containers.",
    "Add enough water to fill each container nearly to the top.",
    "Each container will now have a different shade of cabbage water.",
    "Leave a little bit of room at the top of each container, so that there is space to add in the other ingredients.",
    "Mix 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of white vinegar into each container.",
    "Have your kids measure out the vinegar and pour it into one container at a time.",
    "Watch as the color changes instantly!",
    "You could even have the kids use an eyedropper for a more authentic potion-making experience.",
    "The vinegar is an acid, which reacts with the cabbage water, which is an indicator, and that is why the color changes.",
    "Put 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baking soda into each container.",
    "Watch as the cabbage water bubbles and changes color again!",
    "If you\u2019re concerned about foam getting all over your workspace, do this step on top of a baking tray or paper plate.",
    "The baking soda is an alkaline, which also reacts to the acidity in the vinegar and the cabbage water.",
    "Continue mixing in vinegar and baking soda to make even more colors!",
    "Your kids can keep adding vinegar and baking soda in turn to create more colors and reactions.",
    "If you need to, dump out a little of the cabbage water to make more room for the other ingredients."
