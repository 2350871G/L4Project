You can reduce the oil to \u215b inch if you prefer. However, keep in mind that by caramelizing the garlic in it, you\u2019ll infuse the oil with the flavor so you can use it for pasta, salad dressings, and other dishes."

However, if you plan to store the garlic for later use, it\u2019s a good idea to leave it in the oil because the oil will help preserve it. The garlic will keep for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. If you\u2019re separating the oil and garlic but want to save the oil for future use, pour it in a glass jar and store in the refrigerator."
