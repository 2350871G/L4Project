      "description":"Knobs generally ship with a 1 \u00bd \u2013 2\" screw, and you should check to be sure this will work for your installation. Doors and drawers will sometimes need two different screw lengths and different pieces of furniture may need different sizes. Drawers with faces applied as a separate piece will require screws to pass through 1 \u00bc\" - 1 \u00bd\" of wood or substrate. Doors are usually made of \u00be\" lumber so 1\" screws usually work. You can measure the depth of the face where the screw will go in. In addition to length, you must have screws that are the correct diameter. This won't be an issue if you can use the screws that came with your knobs. But if the screws that came with your knob aren't the right length, the best thing to do is figure out the length you need and take the knob to the hardware store with you so that you're sure to get a screw that is the correct diameter."
