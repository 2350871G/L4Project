Avoid using soap when cleaning since this can leave a residue. Instead, use hot water and scrub with a stiff brush. You can also disinfect the equipment with a bleach solution (1/4 cup bleach for every gallon of water).

You'll also need to sterilize the pomegranates using a Campden tablet. Dissolve one Campden tablet in 2 cups of the crushed pomegranates. Return this mixture to to the rest of the crushed seeds. To give the Campden tablet time to work, wait 4 hours before continuing on and adding other ingredients."

After the liquid is in your long-term storage container, fit an airlock on the top. This will release gas and keep oxygen from entering the container (which could ruin your wine). Let your wine set for a month. If you don't have an airlock, you can place a small balloon or latex glove over the opening of your carboy or demijohn.

Position the cork over the opening of the bottle and push down firmly using your shoulders. Some brewery supply stores rent corking machines for home use.
