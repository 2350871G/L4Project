All other cuts: roughly 20 minutes per pound. Poultry: Chicken breast (2 lbs); 35 to 45 minutes. Game hen (1 to 1.5 lbs); 1 to 1.5 hours. Turkey breast (2 to 4 lbs); 2.5 to 3 hours. Whole chicken (3 to 4 lbs); 1.5 to 2 hours. Whole duck (3.5 to 4 lbs); 2 hours. Whole goose: (7 to 9 lbs); 2.5 to 3 hours. Whole pheasant (2 to 3 lbs); 1 to 1.25 hours.

With whole birds, check the meat\u2019s temperature in fives places: the deepest part of the breast, thighs, and wings. With the thighs and wings, center your thermometer close to where they meet the body.

    "Put on some oven mitts, open the oven, and pull the rack out until you can safely grip the pan with both hands.",
    "Carefully transfer the pan to the stovetop or trivet.",
    "Move slowly and cautiously to avoid spilling hot juices over the sides of the pan.",
    "Preparing and Serving Your Roast Choose which meat to roast.",
    "Decide on one of the three most common meats to roast: ham, prime rib, or turkey.",
    "Or, break away from the norm and choose either beef, lamb, poultry, pork, or veal.",
    "Available cuts of meat include:\n\nBeef: bottom round; brisket; eye round; rib eye roast (with or without bone); round tip; rump; tenderloin; tri-tip.",
    "Lamb: leg (with or without bone); shank leg; shoulder.",
    "Pork: crown; ham; loin; ribs; shoulder/butt; tenderloin.",
    "Poultry: chicken breast; rock cornish game hen; turkey breast; whole chicken; whole duck; whole goose; whole pheasant; whole turkey.",
    "Veal: loin; rib.",
    "Check the meat\u2019s grade.",
    "Once you have chosen which type of meat to roast, decide which grade of meat to purchase.",
    "Choose \u201cprime\u201d for the highest quality, which includes more fat marbling within the meat and thus more flavor.",
    "Go with \u201cchoice\u201d for a less expensive cut that still has a fair amount of fat throughout the meat.",
    "Pick \u201cselect\u201d to save money and/or reduce your fat intake.",
    "Season your meat.",
    "Keep it simple and rub your roast evenly with salt and pepper.",
    "Or, create a more diverse seasoning mix for more complex flavors.",
    "To season the inside as well as the outside, marinate your meat for two days before roasting.",
    "Flip the meat over at regular intervals to make sure it is evenly marinated.",
    "Choose one of the following recipes or pick one of the many, many others to be found online:\n\nBeef seasonings: 1 teaspoon salt, \u00bc teaspoon pepper, \u215b teaspoon garlic powder for each pound of meat.",
    "Chicken seasonings: 1 ounce melted butter, \u2153 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, \u00bc teaspoon pepper, \u215b teaspoon garlic powder, rosemary and/or thyme to taste, for each pound of meat.",
    "Lamb marinade: \u00bc cup fresh rosemary, 2 tablespoons dijon mustard, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 1 cup beef broth, 1 chopped garlic head, 1 chopped onion for 6 to 10 pounds of meat.",
    "Pork seasonings: 1 teaspoon garlic salt and \u00bc teaspoon of black pepper for each pound of meat.",
    "Let the meat cool before carving.",
    "After you remove the meat from the oven, let it rest before carving.",
    "Give the meat time to reabsorb the juices inside so they don\u2019t spill out when you carve it open.",
    "Allow thinner cuts at least 10 minutes to cool.",
    "Give thicker cuts a minimum of 20 minutes, since their core may still be hot enough to continue cooking the meat from the inside out.",
    "After that, transfer the meat to a carving board to slice it up.",
    "Store meat safely.",
    "Refrigerate or freeze your leftovers no more than two hours after it has finished roasting.",
    "Halve that time to one hour if the room temperature exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "If you have a lot of meat left, distribute it into multiple small, airtight containers so that the contents cool off more quickly.",
    "Roasted meat will last three to four days in the refrigerator and two to six months in the freezer.",
    "Trying Variations Truss your meat.",
    "If necessary, bundle your meat with twine to maintain its shape during roasting.",
    "This is most commonly needed for whole birds.",
    "Either ask your butcher to truss your meat for you, or buy butcher\u2019s twine, which is safe to use with food products and available at grocery and cookware stores, as well as online.",
    "Use square knots or slip knots to tie a separate length of twine into a knot every inch along the entire length of the meat.",
    "Baste your roast.",
    "Prevent the outside surface of your roast from drying out while the interior finishes cooking.",
    "Collect the juices and drippings that have pooled at the bottom of the pan, using a basting brush, bulb, or spoon.",
    "Pour the liquid over the meat the top of the meat to rehydrate its exterior.",
    "Repeat every 15 to 30 minutes.",
    "Sear the meat before roasting.",
    "If frozen or refrigerated, allow your meat to defrost to room temperature before beginning.",
    "Season it as desired and give its surface time to dry.",
    "Line a skillet with just enough cooking oil to cover its surface and preheat it over medium-high heat until the first signs of smoke appear.",
    "Place the meat into the skillet.",
    "Let each side of it to sear until it has browned to a crust.",
    "Avoid moving the meat repeatedly or unnecessarily.",
    "Add vegetables.",
    "Line your roasting tray with a light amount of cooking oil to prevent your vegetables from sticking.",
    "Then add your favorite veggies to the tray.",
    "Spray them lightly with cooking oil.",
    "Place your meat on top of them.",
    "Check your veggies periodically during the roast to make sure they aren\u2019t sticking or burning to the pan.",
    "Moisten them with the meat\u2019s drippings or add just enough water to the pan to slick its surface.",
    "Use an oven bag.",
    "Place your meat in an oven roasting bag to trap heat for quicker roasting times.",
    "First, pour roughly a tablespoon of flour inside, twist the opening shut, and give the bag a few shakes so the flour lines all of the inside.",
    "Insert the meat and seal the bag with a twist-tie.",
    "Poke a few holes in the bag so steam can vent as the meat roasts.",
    "Only use bags that are specifically designed for roasting.",
    "Do not use any plastic bags that haven\u2019t been approved by the FDA.",
