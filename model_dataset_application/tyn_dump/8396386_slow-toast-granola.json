Your granola should be about one part rolled oats, nuts or other grains and one part sweeteners and spices. You\u2019ll have a little wiggle room to use more or less of any particular ingredient as you prefer as long as you keep it all roughly equal. Experiment with creating your own spice blends using spices like nutmeg, allspice or flavored sugars and salts.

You can also use another sweetener like maple syrup, simple syrup or agave nectar instead of honey if you feel like switching up the flavor of the granola. Try working in other gooey goodies like peanut butter and applesauce. These types of thick ingredients will blend better if you run them through the microwave for a few seconds first. Though it\u2019s not a necessity, one or two egg whites can protect the granola from the heat of the slow cooker and create a richer texture."

As the dry oats cook, they will absorb the wet ingredients and spices, infusing them with flavor. Cook times may vary between different slow cooker models. Keep an eye on the granola as it cooks.
