If your fruit has been in the freezer, you\u2019ll need to place it on a towel resting inside a bowl to absorb moisture. Let the durian sit out for at least 6 hours so that it can soften up and become both tastier and easier to open. Frozen durian is also considered a delicacy. If you want this ice cream-style version, let it thaw for 3 hours and see if you can cut into it."

Too much rattling, however, means that the durian is not quite ready to be eaten.You should hear a slight rumbling or rattling that you have to strain your ear to hear. You can use a cloth or towel to hold the fruit as you shake it. The noise is caused by the seeds. Unripe durians have large seeds and a small amount of flesh that leads to a noisy rattling, while ripe ones have enough flesh to cushion the seed a little, softening the noise."

Without experience, it can be difficult to distinguish a ripe durian from an over-ripe one by smell, as the fruit will smell extremely potent either way. After you\u2019ve smelled a few ripe and over-ripe durians, the difference will become much clearer. Before you have this experience, the smell test is best for identifying unripe durians, as the lack of smell will give it away."
