  "text":" Cooking the Rice Rinse the rice. For the fried rice, you\u2019ll need 1 cup (225 g) of uncooked long grain white rice. Before cooking it, place it in a colander and rinse it under cool water at the sink to remove any dusty starch. You can substitute any type of rice that you like. Both white and brown will work, as well as long, medium, or short grain. Bring the water to a boil. To cook the rice, you\u2019ll need 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Pour it into a medium saucepan and place it on the stove. Heat it on high until the water comes to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes. For 1 cup (225 g) of uncooked rice, a 2-quart (1.8 l) saucepan is usually a good size. Mix in the rice and bring it to a gentle simmer. Once the water comes to a boil, add the rice to the pan. Stir it in, and allow the mixture to return to a gentle simmer. You may also want to add \u00bd teaspoon (3 g) of salt to the water when you mix in the rice. Cover the rice and cook it on low for at least 18 minutes. After the mixture has come to a gentle simmer, place the lid on the pan. Reduce the heat to low, and allow the rice to cook until it is done. Begin checking on it after 18 minutes -- the rice is done when it is firm but no longer crunchy. Be sure to leave the lid on the pan while the rice is cooking so the steam doesn\u2019t escape.

If there\u2019s still liquid in the pan when the rice is finished cooking, tilt the pan over the skin to drain the remaining water. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to stand for a few minutes. When the rice is finished cooking, turn off the stove. Let the rice sit in the pan for 3 to 5 minutes with the lid on so it has time to finish steaming. Fluff the rice and let it dry out. After the rice has had a few more minutes to steam, remove the lid from the pan. Use a fork to fluff the rice a bit and allow it to dry out while you prepare the other ingredients. Don\u2019t worry about the rice getting cold as you cook the eggs, veggies, and other ingredients. When you combine it with the other ingredients at the end, it will heat up again. Preparing the Pork and Veggies Toss the pork with sesame oil. Place 8 ounces (227 g) of cooked, diced pork loin in a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of dark sesame oil to the meat, and toss well until it is fully coated. Set the meat aside for the moment. You can substitute any meat or protein, such as chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu, for the pork. Mix the onions and carrots. Add 1 cup (150 g) of chopped onion and \u2153 cup (15 g) of grated carrots to a separate small bowl. Toss the two together well so they\u2019re completely mixed, and set the bowl aside. Combine the bean sprouts, peas, and green onions. Add 1 cup (100 g) of bean sprouts, 3 chopped green onions, and \u00bd cup (75 g) of thawed frozen peas to another small bowl. Toss them together until they\u2019re well mixed and set them aside as well. You can substitute scallions for the green onions. Feel free to omit, add, or substitute your favorite veggies in the fried rice. Chinese broccoli and green beans can be tasty additions. Frying the Egg Beat the eggs. For the fried rice, you\u2019ll need 2 eggs. Crack them into a bowl, and beat them lightly with a whisk. You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer. Heat the coconut oil in a wok. Add 2 tablespoons (26 g) of coconut oil to a wok, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to high, and allow the oil to melt, which should take about 3 minutes. If you prefer you can substitute peanut or safflower oil for the coconut oil. Cook the egg until it sets. Once the oil is melted and the wok is hot, pour the beaten eggs into it. Allow the egg to cook, swiveling the wok so the runny portion is constantly moving until it sets. Next, flip the egg over, and let it cook on the other side for a minute. If you prefer, you can simply scramble the eggs in the wok by scraping them around with a wooden spoon. That way, you won\u2019t have to chop the eggs up in the next step. Chop the eggs into pieces and set aside. When the eggs are finished cooking, transfer them from the wok to a plate. Use a knife to chop the egg into small, bite-size pieces. Use a wooden spoon to move the veggies around as they stir fry to ensure that they cook evenly. Stir in the pork and cook the mixture until hot. Once the carrots are tender, add the chopped pork loin to the wok. Let the mixture cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it is very hot and sizzling. Just as before, make sure you stir the pork and veggie mixture in the wok so it cooks evenly. Set the veggie and pork mixture aside. When the pork and veggie mixture is hot, transfer it to the plate with the cooked egg. Set the plate aside for the moment. Finishing Off the Rice Heat the butter and coconut oil in the wok. After you\u2019ve removed the pork and veggie mixture, add 4 tablespoons (57 g) of butter and another 2 tablespoons (26 g) of coconut oil to the wok. Allow them to heat for a minute. If there\u2019s still some coconut oil in the wok, you may not need to add as much as 2 tablespoons (26 g). Stir in the rice and season with salt and pepper. When the butter and coconut have melted, add the cooked rice to the work. Mix in 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt and \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of black pepper to season it as well.
