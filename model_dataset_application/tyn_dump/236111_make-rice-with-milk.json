Cover it with an equal amount of the milk of your choice.Tip: Using cooked rice is the easiest way to make rice pudding. You don\u2019t have to cook it as long as if you were to make the rice from scratch and the texture will be very pudding-like. This is the traditional way to make arroz con leche, which is the Spanish and Latin American version of rice with milk. For example, if you have 1 cup (195 g) of cooked rice, combine it with 1 cup (236 mL) of milk. Make sure that you only use unflavored cooked rice for this. You can use short-grain, long-grain, white or brown rice. Whole milk will give the rice pudding the richest flavor. However, you can use 2% or low-fat milk if you prefer. Avoid using skim milk as it is too watery. If you want a non-dairy option, try using coconut milk or almond milk."
