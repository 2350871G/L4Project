Or you can use an electric or mechanical knife sharpener to smooth your blade until it's sharp again. To tell if your knife is dull, hold a large piece of paper and slice directly through it. Ensure that the knife is pointing away from you as you slice. If the knife can't slice through the paper, you need to sharpen it."

Lay this on your work surface and place the cutting board directly on the cloth. It will hold your cutting board in place. Avoid using glass cutting boards which can damage your knives.
