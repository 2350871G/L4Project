      "headline":"Be aware of the textural and taste differences between the two types of cheese.",
      "description":"Each cheese comes with its own texture and \"ripeness\":\nParmesan: is a fruity flavoured cheese with a peppery after-taste. It tends to be sold at varying stages of ripeness, which impacts the strength of its taste but its texture usually remains the same, hard and grainy. Pecorino: this is a sharp, salty-flavoured cheese. Pecorino tends to be most widely available after considerable aging or ripening. Pecorino is hard like Parmesan and grates well. It is also possible to get a softer Pecorino, however, and this is where it can differ from Parmesan in texture. If you purchase fresher, younger Pecorino, you will discover that it is softer, with a lighter colouring and a texture similar to a firm Brie. It also tastes less strong."

      "headline":"Use your Parmesan and Pecorino.",
      "description":"Both cheese types are similar, and so are fairly interchangeable unless you prefer one for any particular reason. Providing both cheese types on a cheese platter is a good serving suggestion. And both are fine for cooking, so feel free to substitute Pecorino for Parmesan in your favourite recipes, as the taste will be fairly similar."
