  "text":" Preparing Seeds or a Sapling Extract the pit from fully-ripe fruits. Scrub off any fruit matter with a brush and allow the surface to dry.

Take out the almond-shaped seeds, and stratify the seed (prepare it for germination) by soaking it overnight in a container of warm water. Harvest seeds from mid- to late-season apricots. Make sure the seed comes from a fruit that is far from trees of the same genus to prevent in-breeding during pollination.

Planting the Seed or Sapling Select a location with full sun and good soil. The soil should drain well but hold on to moisture. Apricots prefer a slightly alkaline soil in the pH range of 6.5-8.0. Ensure that the area has no weeds, and does not have light or sandy soil. Avoid anywhere that has had eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, raspberries, or strawberries growing in or near it.
