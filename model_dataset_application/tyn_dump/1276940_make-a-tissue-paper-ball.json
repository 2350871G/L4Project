Alternating two different colors leads to a pretty design. 20 x 30 inch (51 x 76 centimeter) tissue paper sheets will make a ball slightly larger than your head. 10 x 5 in. (25 x 12 cm) sheets make roughly fist-sized balls."

Repeat until the entire sheet is folded into equal accordion folds. If you're using small sheets of tissue paper, make roughly \u00bd in. (2.5 cm) folds instead. You should be able to make at least 16 folds (eight forward, eight back)."

      "description":"Fold the tissue stack lengthwise, to make a crease in the center. Unfold it back to a long strip. Tie a length of craft wire around the crease. Squish the fold between your fingers and pull the wire as tight as you can. Twist the wire around itself and snip off the excess. You should end up with a long \"bow tie\" shape. Don't tie the wire around both halves, or you'll end up with a fan shape instead. Leave \u00bd in (2.5 cm) of extra wire if you want to attach the balls to other objects."

Gradually pull the tissue paper to form a puffy flower shape:\nBring the fold around to form a circle. Tug the top sheet of paper gently upward to start the ball. Do this on both sides of the fold. Repeat for the top \u2153 of the stack (roughly). Flip the stack over. Repeat for the top \u2153 on the other side. Turn the ball on its side. Tug apart the remaining sheets of paper to complete the ball."

Hang it from a ceiling fixture, or attach to the ceiling using tape or an adhesive hook. Place them on top of vases to make \"Dr Seuss flowers.\" Make miniature balls and tie them around napkins for a pretty place setting. Stick small balls on wooden skewers to top a birthday cake."
