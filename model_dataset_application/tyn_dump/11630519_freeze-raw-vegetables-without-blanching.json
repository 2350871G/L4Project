          "description":"Use a sharp knife and a cutting board to cut up your leafy greens into small, \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. Cutting your vegetables mimics the effects of blanching and stops the enzyme reaction in the vegetable that causes flavor and color loss. Leafy greens include kale, lettuce, arugula, and spinach. Use caution as you chop your vegetables. Keep your fingers tucked underneath your hand with your knuckles facing the knife to avoid an injury."

          "description":"Lay a resealable plastic bag on its side. Portion out the amount of vegetables that you think you'll use in 1 serving. Spread your vegetable pieces in a thin, even layer inside of the bag, making sure they don\u2019t clump up at the bottom. If you aren't sure how many vegetable pieces you'll need for 1 serving, put about 1 cup (220 g) in each bag. Spreading the vegetable pieces out will allow all of them to freeze evenly and will trap less air in the bag."
