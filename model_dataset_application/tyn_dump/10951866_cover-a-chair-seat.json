          "description":"This might look a little different just depending on what kind of a chair you\u2019re working with and how it was originally assembled. Start by flipping the chair over to see how the seat is attached to the chair frame. Most often, you\u2019ll use a screwdriver to detach the seat, but sometimes, you might need pliers, a hammer, or even something like an X-ACTO knife to start prying it loose. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll be able to put the frame off to the side and set the seat on your worktable. Set the screws or nails off to the side somewhere safe so you can use them later when it\u2019s time to reattach the seat to the frame."

          "description":"Use a flathead screwdriver or pliers to pull out every single staple that is used to attach the dust cover, fabric, and batting. Set the fabric pieces off to the side once they\u2019re removed\u2014you can use them as a pattern to cut the new fabric to the right size. For difficult staples, try putting the edge of a screwdriver or sturdy knife under the staple, and then tap the end of the apparatus with a hammer to create a fulcrum that will lift the staple up. If you\u2019re working with more than one chair, use masking tape to mark each seat with its corresponding frame. Put a piece of tape on each part of the chair and write down the same letter or number so you can match them up later."

          "headline":"Replace the seat with plywood if it\u2019s cracked or worn down.",
          "description":"Depending on the state of your chairs, you may not need to worry about this at all. After you\u2019ve removed the cushion and fabric, examine the seat. If you need to, use the original seat as a template to cut a new one out of plywood with a circular saw or a table saw. Sand the edges with 200-grit sandpaper so that they\u2019re smooth and won\u2019t snag on the fabric. The color of the plywood doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019ll be completely covered by fabric and a dust cover, so no one will ever see it."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut out foam to fit over the surface area of the seat.",
          "description":"Use a bread knife to make long, smooth cuts in the foam, and pull the knife toward yourself with light pressure so that the material doesn\u2019t tear. Most upholstery experts recommend using a medium-soft upholstery foam that is 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) thick, just depending on how much padding you\u2019d like. You can use the foam you removed earlier as a guide to trace and cut out the new foam. This will ensure a uniform size that will fit on the chair really well."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Put batting overtop of the foam and staple it to the back of the seat.",
          "description":"Use enough batting so that it extends past all the sides of the chair by about 4 inches (10 cm). Use a single staple on each side to hold the batting down in place. This will make it easier to attach the fabric later on because you won\u2019t need to worry about the foam slipping out of place. Batting typically costs $5 for about 7 feet (84 in) of material. Assuming you\u2019ll need 1 to 2 feet (12 to 24 in) for each chair you\u2019re reupholstering, buy enough packs from your local craft store to meet your needs. Use a hand stapler, electric stapler, or a pneumatic stapler. Don\u2019t use a normal office-supply stapler, though, as it won\u2019t provide enough force to keep the fabric in place."

Look online, too, if you don\u2019t find anything you like at the store. If you\u2019re using a solid color, you don\u2019t need to worry about lining the fabric up, but if you\u2019re using a patterned fabric, you\u2019ll want to make sure the pattern will look right once it\u2019s attached to the chair. Measure the fabric you detached from the chair earlier to determine exactly how much material you\u2019ll need for each seat. Generally, you\u2019ll need 1 to 2 feet (12 to 24 in) per chair, but you can get more specific measurements if you use the old fabric as a guide."

Then, carefully flip it over so you can access its underside. Start stapling in the middle of the side closest to you, and put a staple in every 2 inches (5.1 cm). Pull the fabric taut so that there are no wrinkles across the fabric. Stop about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from each corner. Repeat this on each side. Flip the seat over periodically as you\u2019re working to check that the pattern is still straight. It\u2019s easier to make adjustments as you go rather than having to remove staples later on. If your seat is round, create small pleats around the edges to keep the fabric lying flat."

    "The material will only need to cover the bottom of the seat and shouldn\u2019t exceed the perimeter of the seat bottom.",
    "Use your stapler to secure the material to the back of the chair, stapling it every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm).",
    "Make sure to staple each corner into place, too, so that they don\u2019t flap loose.",
    "This makes your chair look a lot neater, as no one will be able to see potential fraying fabric or ragged cut lines.",
    "Reattach the seat to the chair frame and enjoy your handiwork.",
    "Once everything has been installed on the chair, it\u2019s time to flip it back over and situate it on the chair frame.",
    "Reinstall the seat with screws or nails\u2014whichever way it was put together in the first place.",
    "If the fabric starts coming loose at any time, just use your stapler to secure it back in place.",
    "Using Removable Covers Measure your chair to determine what size covers you\u2019ll need.",
    "The width and depth of the seat are most important when you\u2019re looking to cover a chair seat.",
    "If you\u2019re going to purchase a cover that goes over the back of the chair, as you might if your entire chair is upholstered, then you\u2019ll need those measurements, too.",
    "Most removable covers are somewhat adjustable in size (they\u2019ll either be stretchy so they can extend as wide as your seat, or they\u2019ll come with adjustable ties so you can make them tighter or looser, depending on the chair size).",
    "Price out if it would be less expensive to buy or make your own covers.",
    "If you have a strong preference either way (like you definitely don\u2019t want to make your own covers or you prefer to make things yourself), then do that.",
    "But if you\u2019re on the fence about which option to choose, look up prices for buying the covers versus what it would cost for the materials (and your time) to make your own.",
    "Keep in mind the cost of shipping if you buy covers online.",
    "If making your own, consider the cost of the fabric, any other materials you\u2019ll need, like thread, elastic, or ties, as well as your time\u2014it will take you several hours or more to make the covers, depending on how many chairs you have.",
    "Make your own covers if you have a specific fabric you\u2019d like to use.",
    "When choosing the fabric, look for durable material that can stand up to a little wear and tear.",
    "Cotton, linen, and microfiber work well if you want your covers to look a little more elegant.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for an option that will protect and keep your chair clean from stains, look for spandex.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a bargain, you could even go thrifting and use a set of colorful sheets, thin blankets, or even curtains.",
    "Buy seat covers online or at a home goods store for a no-fuss option.",
    "Are you simply looking for a visual upgrade, or do you want to cover up worn fabric?",
    "Perhaps you want to protect the fabric that\u2019s underneath or want to match your dining room\u2019s decor for a special event.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a simple way to update a room, buying seat covers can be a quick, easy way to accomplish that.",
    "Check out the reviews from other customers and make sure to look at the cleaning instructions to determine if you can wash the seat covers yourself or if they\u2019ll need to be dry cleaned.",
    "Slip or secure the covers over top of your dining room or kitchen chairs.",
    "Some covers are made with elastic so they just pop over the chair seat and are good to go.",
    "Others will need to be tied into place around the chair legs.",
    "Take a few minutes to line everything up and secure the cover so that it\u2019s ready to be used.",
    "If your cover utilizes the tie-system, don\u2019t double-knot or tie the strands too tightly.",
    "A loose loop and bow will look nice, plus you\u2019ll more easily be able to untie them when you need to clean or replace the covers.",
    "Remove and wash the covers when they get visibly dirty.",
    "Make sure to follow the instructions.",
    "Most seat covers are made of more durable material and can be washed in the washing machine and then hung up to line-dry.",
    "Depending on the material, you may also need to iron out wrinkles after the cover has dried.",
    "Depending on the level of use, you shouldn\u2019t need to clean the seat covers more than once every 3 months.",
    "Of course, if you have young kids or pets, you may need to clean them more often if they\u2019re more susceptible to stains."
