If using a hard container, fill it at least halfway with leaves. The more air in the container, the faster you'll get brown edges. If you press out all the air and seal the container completely, the lettuce may develop off flavors due to poor respiration. Leaving a little air or cracking the container slightly may be a better idea, especially with leaf lettuce or a fridge that's on the warm side."

Do not squeeze the leaves into tight spaces with other foods, which may cause bruising. Do not store in the same drawer as apples, pears, or tomatoes, which release high amounts of ethylene gas that can cause spoilage."
