You can purchase a basic gutter-cleaning attachment for around $30. You may also be able to find these accessories at your local hardware store or home improvement center. If you don't already own a wet/dry vacuum, you can get one of these from your local home improvement center, as well. They typically cost about $100 brand new, and around $20 per day to rent.

First, fit your wet/dry vacuum or leaf blower with 1 or 2 extension wands to lengthen your reach. Then, tape 2 duct elbows together end-to-end before taping the contraption to the nozzle of the vacuum. It\u2019s as easy as that! To ensure that your makeshift gutter attachment holds together, use a strong type of tape, like duct or Gorilla tape. Aluminum duct elbows cost about $5 apiece at most hardware stores, which means you can save roughly $20 by cobbling together your own attachment if you already have a suitable roll of tape.Tip: Be sure to shop around for duct elbows that will fit over the nozzle of your vacuum without too much extra space around the edges. A pair of elbows with a diameter of 3 in (7.6 cm) should fit comfortably over a standard 2.5 in (6.4 cm) vacuum nozzle."
