    "Cut out 5 sections from a paper egg carton using scissors.",
    "Have an adult use a low-heat hot glue gun to attach them to the appropriate places on the balloon.",
    "Line the edges of the egg-holders with hot glue and place 4 of them on the side of the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 balloon opposite the coin slot.",
    "Put the nose in the middle of whichever side you\u2019ve picked to be the front of the piggy bank.",
    "Place the piggy bank on its legs so the glue can set and let it sit for 30 minutes before you begin decorating.",
    "Decorate your piggy bank with paint and accessories.",
    "Paint the body of the piggy bank with spray or acrylic paint, evenly coating the surface as you go.",
    "Then, make a tail by twisting a pink pipe cleaner into a spiral and having an adult help you hot glue it to the pig\u2019s bottom.",
    "You can also give the pig eyes by gluing googly eyes onto its face, or by drawing, cutting out, and gluing on eyes.",
    "Ultimately, the design is your choice.",
    "Other decoration ideas include drawing nostrils onto the pig\u2019s snout with a black marker and cutting 2 triangles out of pink paper or felt to glue them on as ears.",
    "If you do not want to use paint, you can color the body of the piggy bank with markers."
