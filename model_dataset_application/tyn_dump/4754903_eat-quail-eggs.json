Just make sure the water covers the eggs entirely."

Then roll the egg on a flat surface so the rest of the shell cracks. Don\u2019t apply too much pressure while rolling the egg or you\u2019ll crush it. Just roll lightly. Put down a paper towel to catch any shell bits that fall off."

Don't press down or squeeze when you remove the shell to avoid crushing the egg. Remember to peel off the clear membrane between the shell and the egg as well. If the shells aren\u2019t coming off, put the eggs back in the ice bath for another minute. Then try to peel them again."

For a classic breakfast, put the eggs on a piece of toast with salt and pepper. Sliced up quail eggs also work as a great salad topping. Use a very thin knife to slice the eggs. If you don\u2019t have a thin knife, try using a strip of dental floss to slice them. If you like spice, add some powdered cayenne pepper. Boiled eggs can last up to a week in the refrigerator. You can also pickle the eggs by soaking them in vinegar."
