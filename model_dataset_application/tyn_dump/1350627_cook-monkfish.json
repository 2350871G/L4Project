Hold your peeler against the top of each potato and drag it downwards carefully to remove the skin in vertical lengths. Wash the potatoes by running them under cold water and rubbing them clean. Pat them dry with paper towels and set them aside. The potatoes are entirely optional, you can skip them if you want to cook the fish on its own."

Trim 1 inch (2.5 cm) off of the top and bottom to remove the stems and cut the onions into 10-15 lengthwise sections. Use your hand to separate the cut lengths and layer the onions along the bottom of a baking dish. Use a glass or ceramic baking dish with a deep rim. The onions will add some flavor to the potatoes and fish. Feel free to drizzle the onions with a little olive oil, pepper, or salt if you want."

Place them in symmetrical rows and leave a little bit of space between each potato.

Monkfish typically isn\u2019t very thick, but if your filets are thicker than 3 in (7.6 cm), cut them in half to thin them down. Spread your monkfish out on top of the potatoes and onions in the baking dish.Tip: The monkfish doesn\u2019t necessarily need to rest entirely on top. If a few pieces slide between some potatoes, it\u2019s perfectly fine."

Season the potatoes and fish with salt and pepper as you please, adding anywhere between 1-3 teaspoons (between 5-15 g) of the seasoning to the top of the dish. Drizzle 0.5 cups (120 mL) of white wine over the fish, onions, and potatoes. You can bake the fish with parsley, oregano, or red pepper flakes as well if you want.

Depending on how thick your potatoes or fish are, it may take a little longer or shorter for the fish and potatoes to brown.

Add 1-3 teaspoons (roughly 5-15 g) of salt and paper to the top of the flour. Take 1.25 pounds (0.57 kg) of monkfish filets or medallions and dredge them in the flour and seasonings. Flip each piece up and down repeatedly in the flour until the entire exterior of each piece is covered. You can use more salt and pepper if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s totally up to you how many spices you want to use. You can add red pepper flakes, paprika, chili powder, or parsley to the flour as well if you\u2019d like. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet and add your monkfish. Take 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil and add it to a separate skillet. Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes until it starts smoking. Take your monkfish filets and drop them carefully into the skillet. Heat them until they\u2019re brown on the side that is in contact with the skillet, which will take 3-4 minutes. It may take anywhere from 5-10 minutes for the vegetable oil to start smoking in the pan. Cook the fillets over high heat until they\u2019re browned. Use a spatula to get under each monkfish filet. Flip them carefully in the pan. Cook the fish on their other side for 3-4 minutes until the fish is browned on both sides. Turn the heat off once the fish is completely cooked and leave it there as you combine the mushrooms and the broth. Add your mushrooms to the stock and serve with your monkfish on top. Take your mushrooms and pour them into the stock as it\u2019s boiling. Stir the ingredients for 2-3 minutes and pour the combination into a clean baking dish. Add your monkfish to the top of the baking dish and serve. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to plate the fish, broth, and mushrooms. Monkfish pairs incredibly well with potatoes. If you\u2019re looking for a side dish, consider mashed, baked, or oven-roasted potatoes. Store your monkfish in an airtight container and reheat on the stove or in the microwave. The dish should stay fresh for 2-3 days.",
