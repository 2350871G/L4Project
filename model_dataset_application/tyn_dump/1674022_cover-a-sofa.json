    "Measure the length and width of your sofa from back to front and side to side.",
    "Use a flexible tape measure to get accurate figures.",
    "Don\u2019t forget to measure the width and length of the sofa\u2019s arms, as well as any removable cushions.",
    "Choose canvas, cotton duck, denim, or twill fabric for your slipcover.",
    "Opt for a wider width of fabric when you buy it from the store.",
    "Anything that is 75 inches (190 cm) wider or more should work for your project.",
    "In general, you\u2019ll need 12 yards (11 m) of fabric for a 6-foot sofa (1.8 m), 14 yards (13 m) for a 7-foot sofa (2.1 m), and an additional 1.5 yards (1.4 m) for each additional cushion over 2.",
    "If you aren\u2019t interested in making separate covers for the cushions, modify your pattern so that the fabric will drape over the top of the cushions and connect to the armrests.",
    "In this situation, you won\u2019t need the excess material for each cushion.Necessary Measurements: To get the right amount of fabric, measure these areas separately: the outside back, inside back, under the cushions, right side, right arm, left side, left arm, front skirt, back skirt, right and left skirts, and any removable cushions.",
    "Wash the fabric before you do anything else to it.",
    "Use cool water on the gentle cycle with a mild detergent.",
    "Hang the fabric up to dry, or put it into the laundry machine on a low-heat setting.",
    "Washing before cutting and sewing is an essential step.",
    "If you don\u2019t do this, the cover will shrink and no longer fit your couch after the first time you do wash it.",
    "If the fabric is especially wrinkly after it has dried, consider ironing it.",
    "Make a pattern for your slipcover with an old sheet.",
    "Remove the cushions from the couch first, as those will get covered separately.",
    "Drape an old sheet over the couch and pin it in place along the seams of the couch (don\u2019t worry about putting pins into your couch\u2014that material will be covered by the new cover anyway).",
    "Use a piece of chalk to draw the edge lines over the fabric so you know where to cut.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to use an old sheet, use butcher paper or something similar so you can make the necessary marks and cut out the pattern without the risk of it ripping easily.",
    "Cut out the pieces for your slipcover from the pattern you made.",
    "Once you\u2019ve made the pattern and washed the fabric, you\u2019re ready to start cutting out the actual pieces for your slipcover.",
    "Add 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) of space around the edge of each piece for the seam allowance.",
    "To help yourself remember which piece goes where, use a fabric marker on the underside of the material to write a label.",
    "For example, you could write \u201cRA\u201d for \u201cright arm.\u201d Additionally, put an arrow next to the label to indicate which side of the fabric should be closest to the ground.",
    "Pin the pieces of fabric together and test them on the couch.",
    "Arrange the fabric so that the right sides will be pinned together, and put a pin along the seams every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm).",
    "Remember to leave that 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) hem so that you\u2019ll have room to sew the pieces together later.",
    "Once a section has been pinned together (for example, the left arm), place it on the sofa to make sure the fabric fits well and is lined up right.",
    "Make whatever adjustments you need to until it looks how you want it to.",
    "Take your time when putting the pins in, and don\u2019t worry if you need to work in smaller sections to get things put together.",
    "It may seem overwhelming at first, but it\u2019ll be done before you know it.",
    "Use a sewing machine to connect all the pieces of the slipcover.",
    "You can sew the slipcover in parts, which might be helpful if you\u2019re worried about getting turned around (there are a lot of pieces to keep track of!).",
    "Or, you could sew the entire slipcover together all at once, which would alleviate some of the back-and-forth trekking to the couch to test the pieces, but it could make it harder to fix mistakes.",
    "Use a straight-stitch for a secure hold.",
    "If you\u2019re interested in creating multiple pieces rather than one large piece, that is okay to do, too!",
    "If you\u2019re doing this, create a separate slipcover for the right arm, the left arm, and the back of the couch.",
    "Just make sure there is enough material to tuck down into the creases of the couch so that ends of the fabric won\u2019t be visible.",
    "Sew covers for the removable pillows and install upholstery zippers.",
    "Measure the length, width, and depth of the cushions and cut out your fabric to fit those measurements.",
    "Remember that you\u2019ll need double the length so that the fabric will wrap around the entire cushion, and leave enough room for a 1 inch (2.5 cm) seam all around.",
    "Sew the pieces together and put in an upholstery zipper at the back of each pillow.",
    "The zippers will allow you to easily remove the slipcover so you can wash it in the future.",
    "Slip the new cover onto your couch and enjoy your handiwork.",
    "Once your slipcover and couch cushions are finished, go ahead and put them onto your sofa.",
    "The entire look of your room will instantly change and feel refreshed.",
    "Keep in mind that you can change out the slipcover as often as you want.",
    "Different patterns for different seasons, new colors, and fun patterns are great options to use to quickly update the look of a room."
