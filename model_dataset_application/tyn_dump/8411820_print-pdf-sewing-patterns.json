Also, pay attention to the seam allowances. Some patterns include them while others don't. Cutting then Assembling the Pattern (Option 2) Clear some space on your floor or table. In this method, you will be cutting out all of the pieces first, then putting them together. Depending on the type of pattern you are working with, you might need a lot of space. For example, a long skirt will require a lot more space than a pair of gloves. Cut the pattern pieces out. Keep like pieces together with like pieces. For example, if you are cutting a princess dress, keep all of the sleeve pieces together, all of the skirt pieces together, and all of the bodice pieces together. Match the pieces together. PDF patterns will usually have little symbols along the edges that you have to line up. Match up like symbols with like symbols. For example, you should match up single arrows with single arrows, and double arrows with double arrows. Overlap the pattern pieces, if needed.
