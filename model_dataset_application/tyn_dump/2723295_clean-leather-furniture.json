Use the soft brush attachment to clean the surface of the furniture, too. Always use the vacuum attachments rather than picking up the entire vacuum and putting it on the furniture.

Start at the top of the furniture and work your way down so that any dislodged dust or dirt will fall to areas that haven\u2019t been wiped clean yet. While you\u2019re wiping the furniture down, take note of any areas that are stained or particularly dirty so you can treat them later."

To prevent spilling the mixture, place the bowl on the ground near the furniture that you\u2019re cleaning.

It\u2019s not necessary to clean the entire piece of furniture, though it won\u2019t hurt the leather to wipe the whole thing down. Be very gentle if you\u2019re cleaning unprotected leather, as it is much easier to scratch and damage."

Once the grease has mostly been removed, sprinkle enough baking soda over the stain so it\u2019s completely covered. Leave the baking soda on the stain for 2 to 3 hours, then wipe it away with a clean cloth. Don\u2019t use water to wipe away grease stains. Water could actually cause the grease to set into the leather, rather than clearing it away. The baking soda helps draw the grease out of the leather, making it easier to wipe away."

Dab in an up-and-down motion, rather than rubbing the area. Stop once the stain has been lifted. Depending on how big the stain is, you may need to use more than 1 cotton ball. The stain should transfer from the leather to the cotton ball, so when you notice the cotton looks stained, trade it out for a fresh one."

Let it sit for 10 minutes, and then wipe it clean with a damp washcloth. Don\u2019t use this method on darker pieces, as the lemon juice could lighten the leather."
