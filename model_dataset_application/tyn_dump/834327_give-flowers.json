Purple hyacinths and yellow carnations, on the other hand, can be used to console or extend sympathy for a difficult loss. Traditionally, different colors of flowers were said to express different emotions. Red flowers signified passionate love, for instance, while white blossoms represented beauty and pink promised remembrance. The magic of the gift of flowers lies not just in the act of giving but in the type of flowers given."

You have a wide array of colors to choose from\u2014between annual and perennial species, you can find flowers that are red, yellow, blue, purple, pink, white, and practically everything in between. Some flowers even showcase multiple shades, such as wand flower, walking iris, and harlequin blueflag. If you don\u2019t know your recipient\u2019s favorite color, it\u2019s usually best to go with a safe choice like red, pink, or white."

Bundling flowers in plastic is a simple yet charming way to keep them together until you give them to their recipient. You can also use heavy wrapping paper if you don\u2019t have a suitable piece of plastic lying around. Never package flowers in a box, if you have a choice. Not only does this leave them more vulnerable to damage, it also prevents light from reaching them, causing them to wilt prematurely."

Fill the vase halfway up with fresh, cool water and insert the stems until they\u2019re submerged by about 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm). Arrange the flowers neatly so that the blooms are on full display. For best results, use a sharp knife or pair of scissors to trim the stems of your flowers at a 45-degree angle. This will allow them to absorb more water than they could when cut straight across. Dump a packet of flower food or a couple tablespoons of sugar into the water in the vase to ensure that your flowers last as long as possible."

Slip the envelope into the plastic cone the flowers are wrapped in, or tape it to the side of the vase if you decide to use a more formal container. This isn\u2019t a required step, but it can make a nice touch, especially if you\u2019re close with the person you\u2019re giving the flowers to.

Depending on the size of the arrangement, you might combine as many as half a dozen varieties of flowers. Carefully-coordinated flower arrangements make excellent gifts not just because of their impressive appearance, but because of their ease of upkeep, as well.
