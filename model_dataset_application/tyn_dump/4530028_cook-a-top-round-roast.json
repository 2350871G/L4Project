You will have an easier time rubbing in the spices and cooking the meat after it is unfrozen. If you\u2019re in a hurry, you can try defrosting it in the microwave. Heat it at a low temperature until it is no longer frozen. Another way to speed up defrosting is to submerge the meat under cold water. Do this only if your roast is in a watertight container.

Sprinkle in about 0.6 oz (17 g) of both salt and pepper before stirring the ingredients into a paste. You can mix the ingredients 24 hours in advance and put them in a bag with the roast. The meat will absorb more of the flavors while the salt draws out flavor from the meat. Experiment with your seasoning ingredients. For example, you can leave out the shallot and mustard. You can add other herbs and spices or make a balsamic glaze."

You may see recipes using wildly different temperatures, and cooking the beef at a different temperature is fine if you want to experiment. Lower temperatures mean slower cooking, so adjust your timer accordingly. Instead of using an oven, you can cook roasts in a dutch oven. Start by searing the meat in oil, then add beef stock and other ingredients. Put the dutch oven in your oven for 2 to 3 hours. Another option is a slow cooker. Sear the meat before adding all of your ingredients to the slow cooker. Cook for about 4 to 6 hours on high or 8 to 10 hours on low."

You can also use a roasting rack. Fit it over a roasting pan or baking sheet, which will catch any dripping juices. If you use a slow cooker, don\u2019t use a rack and instead cook the roast in the stock or other liquid you use. Another option is an oven bag. Seal the roast in the bag, then set it in a pan.

Similarly, a cold roast takes a little longer to cook than one at room temperature. Keep a close eye on your roast and test it with a meat thermometer if you aren\u2019t sure it is done. This is the average time to get your top round roast to medium rare. If you want it to be closer to well done, expect it take 30 to 35 minutes per pound. Roasts are best served medium rare, though.

You can start the roasting process at a higher temperature, then lower it after about 15 minutes. The high temperature can give the roast a nice, brown sear.
