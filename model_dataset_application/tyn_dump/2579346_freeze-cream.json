  "text":" Just cream Pour the cream into a rigid sided container. Cover with a strong plastic bag that seals (in fact, two bags is recommended), to prevent fridge odours from entering. Leave at least 1.5cm/1/2 inch space between the lid and the top of the cream. This allows for expansion when it freezes. Place in the freezer.  Sweetened cream Pour the cream into a suitable bowl.  Whip the cream lightly. Only whip until it's just stiff. Mix through 1 level teaspoon of sugar to the cream. For each 125ml/ 1/4 pint of cream, add another 1 level teaspoon. Pour the cream into a rigid sided container. Cover with a strong plastic bag that seals (in fact, two bags is recommended), to prevent fridge odours from entering. Leave at least 1.5cm/1/2 inch space between the lid and the top of the cream. This allows for expansion when it freezes. Place in the freezer.  Whipped cream dollops Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone sheet.  Whip the cream.  Place dollops of the cream onto the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a thick freezer bag that seals. Freeze. When frozen, remove and slide into a storage container or bag. To avoid being bumped, a rigid sided container is again best. Seal and return to the freezer.  Thawing Just cream: Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Or, if the food is bubbling away already, add straight to a cooking dish (such as a soup or stew), as if adding fresh cream and let the heat melt it through. Be aware that the cream will be runny and won't whip after freezing. Sweet cream: For using as a cake or dessert filling or topping, thaw in the refrigerator overnight first. As with the previous cream, this frozen cream can't be whipped again; unlike that one though, it should keep its already whipped texture suitable for baking or adding to desserts. Plus, you could try combining it with freshly whipped cream to make a filling go further. Fixing separated cream: Jiggle the cream inside its container (lid on) if you find too much separation has occurred. This can help to reconstitute the cream by mixing the fat solids and water solids back together again. It can also be shaken inside the sealable bag if that's easier.
