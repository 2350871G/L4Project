          "description":"An EC meter is a small device with a screen and 1-2 metal probes. Since salt is highly conductive, you can get a sense for how much salt is in the soil based on how quickly an electrical current passes through it. This is the best way to get a solid sense of whether your soil is highly saline or not.Warning: Do not purchase an EC meter that is designed for testing water. These meters do not have probes for soil, and they tend to give inaccurate readings when used to assess salinity in anything other than water. Since it\u2019s a specialized tool, you\u2019ll need to buy your EC meter online. Expect to spend $75-300 on an EC meter. These meters work by sending an electrical signal through the probe and measuring how long it takes the current to travel. The faster the current travels, the more salt there is in the soil. There are other ways to measure salinity in soil, but this is the easiest way to do it without laboratory equipment or multiple instruments."

Hold the probes in steady and wait for the meter to send and read an electrical current.Some EC meters have a temperature setting to determine how hot or cold soil and water is. If the screen reads \u201cF\u201d or \u201cC,\u201d your EC meter is in temperature mode.

    "Plant willow shrubs, saltbushes, switchgrass, or yerba mansa in the soil if you live in a warmer area.",
    "These plants all remove the salt from the soil and thrive in highly saline conditions.",
    "You can use a handful of plants to slowly remove salt from a smaller area, or plant a large number of these plants over a larger area to reduce salt levels quickly.Tip: This practice is known as phytoextraction.",
    "Unfortunately, most of these plants will struggle to thrive in cooler climates.",
    "The good news is that highly saline soil is more likely to naturally restore itself over time if you live in a more temperate area.",
    "This can take anywhere from 1-2 weeks, or 1-2 years to restore the soil.",
    "If you recently leached the soil, plant some yerba mansa.",
    "This plant really loves being planted in wet soil and is more likely to thrive than other plants.",
    "Use salt-free fertilizers to grow crops and plants and prevent salinization.",
    "If you rely on fertilizers to cultivate and grow your plants and crops, use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer with a 0% salt content.",
    "Many commercial fertilizers have trace amounts of salt in them.",
    "Even in small amounts, adding more salt can seriously stilt the process of desalinization.",
    "Switch to organic compost and green manure to keep salt from building up.",
    "If you\u2019re using synthetic materials to cultivate your plants or crops, switching to natural compost and green manure will prevent salt from accumulating in the soil.",
    "Create your own compost bin or pile to replace store-bought varieties.",
    "Swap out manures made of synthetics or animal waste and replace it with green manure.To create a compost pile or bin, create alternating layers of green and brown organic materials.",
    "For the green layers, use trimmed leaves, grass clippings, and vegetable scraps.",
    "For the brown layers, use newspaper, coffee grounds, bark, and spent soil.",
    "Let the materials break down naturally over 3-4 months before using them.",
    "To use green manure, cut or uproot healthy plants work them into the topsoil you want to cultivate.",
    "Let the plants break down naturally over time.",
    "These plants will basically release their nutrients and minerals into the soil, allowing your rooted plants to thrive.",
    "Wait for the soil to restore itself naturally over 2-10 years.",
    "Unless your area experiences frequent droughts, the rain will naturally leach the soils out of the soil over time.",
    "Unfortunately, this can take quite a long time.",
    "In some cases, it may take a few months.",
    "In other cases, it will take up to a decade.",
    "It really depends on the salinity of the soil, the temperature, and the weather where you live.",
    "If you aren\u2019t actively growing anything in the soil and you don\u2019t have any pipes, cables, or buildings near the soil, you don\u2019t actually need to actively reduce the salt levels.",
    "The more temperate your climate is, the more likely the soil is to restore itself over time."
