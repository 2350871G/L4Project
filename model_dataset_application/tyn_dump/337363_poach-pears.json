You can really use any type of pear you like, though some pears are better than others for poaching because they tend to keep their shape better instead of falling apart. Pears that are great for poaching include Beurre Bosc pears, Conference pears, Tiny Seckel pears, and Winter Nellis. Pears like the Anjou, Comice, or Bartlett tend to fall apart when you poach them."

Heat until the mixture is warm and all of the sugar is dissolved in the water. For additional flavor, you can add any of the following: 1/2 cinnamon stick, 1 tsp. whole cloves, 1 lemon quarter, black peppercorns, 1-2 star anise, and 3-4 slices ginger. If you prefer, you can add 1/2 a cup of honey instead of sugar for a thicker flavor. If you'd like more flavor in the syrup, you can make the water mixture half water and half white wine, or 1/4 water and 3/4 red wine."

For an extra precaution, you can cut a piece of parchment paper with a large hole in the center to help keep the pears from floating up and poaching unevenly.
