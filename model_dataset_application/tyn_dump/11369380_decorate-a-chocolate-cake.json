It doesn\u2019t matter how many layers you have, but they should be stuck together with frosting so that they don\u2019t fall off of each other while you are decorating. The layers of frosting you use to stick your cake together will be visible when you cut into the cake. Use a bright color if you want to surprise your guests with multi-colored cake."
