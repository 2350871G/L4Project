If you have a small ball, set it upside down into a cup. If you have a large ball, use a bowl instead. This will keep the ball steady as you work. Hot glue your first few tiles around the bottom of the ball. Place a drop of hot glue onto the back of a tile. Quickly press the tile against the bottom of the ball. Hot glue a few more tiles around it. Make sure that all of the tiles are touching. You are starting from the bottom because that is the most visible part. Continue gluing the tiles to the ball in rows. Try not to leave any gaps between the tiles; they should all be touching on all four sides. This will give you a more finished, professional-looking disco ball. Work one tile at a time and don't apply the hot glue directly to the ball. If you do, it will harden and set before you get to it.
