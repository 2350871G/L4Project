This will create a crust over the roast that helps keep in moisture and flavor while you cook it. At this stage, the center of the chuck roast will still be raw.

Like the roast, the vegetables will have more time to cook thoroughly while you bake or slow cook them. Finishing the Roast in the Oven Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). While searing your chuck roast, turn on your oven so it has time to heat up before you cook the meat. Try to preheat the oven at least 30 minutes before you cook the roast so it reaches 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) when your roast is ready to bake.
