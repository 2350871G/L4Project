Note any obstacles that will need to be removed, such as trees, rocks, fences, or even utility lines. Removing these obstacles takes additional time and money. Think carefully about what you want out of a pool. Leave space for features like pump systems and diving boards. To estimate the size of these features, calculate the size of your pool or how much water it will hold, then look for suitable products. Underground obstacles like utility lines are difficult to find without digging. Call your local utility companies for advice. Ask them to send a technician to mark the location of your lines.

Then, begin planning the features, including pool steps, lighting, and other accessories. Factor in limitations like the yard space you have available to choose the right pool for your situation. An average concrete pool is something like 10 ft \u00d7 20 ft (3.0 m \u00d7 6.1 m) in size with a depth up to 10 ft (3.0 m). All of these dimensions can be changed depending on your ideal pool.

Use a tape measure or marked measuring sticks to keep track of the pool\u2019s depth. For example, if your pool needs to be 6 ft (1.8 m), cut a 6 ft (1.8 m) pole to use as a reference. Make references for the deep and shallow end if your pool has them. Remember that you can always put dirt back if you dig too far down. Dig out the soil by hand if you can\u2019t get a backhoe. Use a spade or alternative digging tools. Some areas aren\u2019t accessible to heavy equipment and have to be dug out the old-fashioned way. Make sure you have your permit and know about any utility lines in the ground. Hitting a utility line is a big problem. Hire a contractor to take care of any utility lines needing to be moved.

    "Then, stand \u20442 in (1.3 cm)-thick plywood around the upper edge of the pool to prevent poured concrete from spilling out.",
    "Use a rebar bender to fit the metal along the walls.",
    "Bind bars together as needed with metal ties from a hardware store.",
    "The rebar forms a frame that strengthens the concrete after you pour it.",
    "Always place the rebar net before adding the concrete.",
    "Install the plumbing lines underneath the rebar and plywood.",
    "Refer to your original design to figure out where to place the plumbing lines.",
    "You will need to dig trenches to guide PVC pipes from the pool to the pump and filtration system.",
    "Make the pipes emerge inside the pool, underneath the plywood barrier.",
    "Hook the pipes up to the pump and filter system when you\u2019re done.",
    "Contract a plumber to take care of the water lines.",
    "Pool plumbing is complex and building codes vary from community to community.",
    "A good plumber will make sure your pool works safely.",
    "Wire the pool\u2019s filtration system and other electrical components.",
    "Call an experienced electrician to connect pool accessories to your community\u2019s electrical grid.",
    "The electrician will lay wire from the pool\u2019s pump and filtration system to your home.",
    "They will also hook up lighting systems and other optional components in your design.",
    "Leave the electrical work up to a professional.",
    "Messing with community power lines is illegal and dangerous.",
    "Poor wiring increases the risk of fires and electrical shock.",
    "Completing the Pool\u2019s Interior Pour concrete into the pool to create the bottom slab.",
    "Purchase plenty of shotcrete mix or gunite.",
    "Place it all in a mixing truck equipped with a big hose or dumping rail.",
    "Dump the concrete onto the rebar or spray it out with a hose attached to the truck.",
    "Use enough concrete to make the pool floor at least 6 in (15 cm) thick.",
    "To make pouring the concrete easier, begin spraying the walls as you lay concrete on the floor so you don\u2019t have to walk back and forth across the wet mix as much.",
    "Spray the walls to coat them with concrete.",
    "Put on some sturdy work boots you don\u2019t mind getting wet, then step into the pool.",
    "Coat the walls to make a layer of concrete at least 6 in (15 cm) thick, Also, add concrete to the top lip of the pool marked off by plywood.",
    "Take care not to spray over any exposed pipe openings.",
    "Cap them and spray around them.",
    "Smooth the concrete out with a concrete float.",
    "Step down into the pool to access the concrete slabs.",
    "You will need a float, which is like a big broom for concrete.",
    "Push the float over the floor to level it, then do the same for the walls.",
    "You can also use a big metal straightedge to smooth out difficult spots along walls and corners.",
    "The straightedge is also helpful for smoothing out steps into a block shape.",
    "Cover the concrete with a plastic sheet for at least 5 days.",
    "For a long-lasting pool, let the concrete cure before continuing to work on it.",
    "Purchase a big plastic sheet from a hardware store.",
    "Make sure it covers the entire pool.",
    "Flatten it against the concrete, then pin it down with stakes, bricks, and other heavy objects.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a good plastic cover, spray the concrete with water from a hose 3 or 4 times a day.",
    "Keep it saturated to prevent it from drying out.",
    "You can also place damp canvas or burlap over the concrete to protect it.",
    "Add water to the cover as needed to keep it moist.",
    "Coat the pool basin with tile to waterproof it.",
    "Glass, ceramic, and porcelain tiles are some of the most popular ways to finish a pool.",
    "Mix mortar, then spread it over the concrete with a trowel.",
    "After waiting at least 24 hours, spread grout over the mortar.",
    "Place the tiles on the grout, leaving a \u20448 in (0.32 cm) gap between each one.",
    "Leave a 6 in (15 cm) gap between the lip of the pool and the top row of tiles.",
    "Make sure the mortar and grout resist chlorine and other chemicals in the water.",
    "Tile lasts up to 10 years on average and resist stains better than other finishes, though it tends to be a little more expensive.",
    "Some other finishes to try include plaster, stone, or a water-resistant epoxy paint.",
    "Alternative finishes last 5 to 8 years on average.",
    "Install coping around the lip of the pool.",
    "Coping is visible and provides walking room around the pool\u2019s edge.",
    "Tile is a common option, but you can also get concrete, marble, or stone.",
    "Each style adds a different aesthetic to your pool, but they all waterproof the exposed concrete.",
    "Wait at least 1 to 2 days for the tile and coping to cure before adding water to the pool.",
    "Install the coping with mortar and grout like you did when lining the pool\u2019s interior.",
    "Cover the 6 in (15 cm) gap you left inside the pool, then arrange another row of coping material around the pool\u2019s rim.",
    "Fill the pool with water.",
    "You now have a concrete pool in your yard.",
    "All you need to do to make it functional is add the water.",
    "Run garden hoses from nearby water spigots to begin.",
    "Doing this takes a long time, so find alternative ways to bring in more water.",
    "Try renting a water truck to dump large amounts of water into the pool.",
    "If you can\u2019t get a truck to the pool, continue using a hose.",
    "It may take all day, but with a little patience, you will soon have a functional pool.",
    "Watch the pool for leaks and other issues.",
    "Empty the pool before attempting a fix."
