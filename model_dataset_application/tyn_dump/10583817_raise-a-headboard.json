Holding the left leg of your headboard over the upper right corner of one plywood piece, trace the leg's outline onto the wood using a pencil or marker. (Do the same with the right headboard leg and the upper left corner of the other plywood piece.) Use a saw to cut away those outlined chunks of wood. Drill two bolts through the middle of each piece of plywood, securely connecting the wood to the legs. Screw nuts onto the end of the bolts to make sure they stay in place. This method only works if your headboard is also made of wood."
