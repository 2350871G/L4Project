Crush your Oreos and nuts, mash your Butterfingers and Reese's, and use mini M&Ms. Place your topping in a separate, wide-brimmed bowl.

A double boiler slowly melts the chocolate, preventing it from bubbling up and burning to a crisp. Add your chocolate chunks, stirring often. If it gets too hot, turn the heat down. Once they are near completely melted, remove from the heat, stirring until smooth and warm. Not hot. The handy microwave is always an option. Heat on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through. Note: With a microwave, there's a greater risk of scorching your chocolate."

If the bits next to the Popsicle stick are proving a bit hard to reach, grab a spoon and dash on a pinch to any hard to reach spots. Even it out; the layering should be equal on all sides."

Then, simply take a spoonful of your drizzle and hold it about six inches (15 cm) above your apples, creating lines of varying thickness across the paper."
