          "description":"When washing clothes, there are two main things to keep in mind: what the color of the clothes are, and what material they are made out of. Not all fabrics can handle the same amount of water pressure or level of tumbling. Separate light and dark-colored clothes. When you wash your clothes, especially new clothes, some of the dye used on the fabric will run out of the clothes (that's why older clothes have a more faded color than bright, new clothes.) Any clothes that are white, cream, or a light, pale pastel color, should go in the \u2018whites\u2019 pile, while all other colored clothes should go in the \u2018dark\u2019 pile. If you don\u2019t separate, your new bright blue shirt might dye all of your white clothes blue. Separate your clothes based on the fabrics they are made out of. Some fabrics, like denim or thick cloth (like a towel) need to be washed on a heavier wash cycle than your silky lingerie (which gets washed on a delicate setting). You should separate your clothes by the sort of wash cycle their fabrics are meant to be washed in."

When in doubt about how to wash an item, check the tag. The care tags tell you what fabric the item is made of, how it should be washed, and how it should be dried. Some clothes need to be dry cleaned or washed by hand (see Method Two for how to do this.) The care tag will tell you if either of these things are necessary."

          "description":"Washing machines have different temperature settings because some fabrics and colors require different levels of heat to be washed thoroughly. Use hot water for light colors, particularly light colors that are especially dirty. The heat will scald the stains right out of those white items. Use cold water for dark colors, as cold water reduces the amount of dye that runs from these clothes (so your clothes won\u2019t fade as fast when you use cold water.) Cotton items should also be washed in cold water as they are less likely to shrink in cold water."

If your clothes fill up one-third of the machine, you should select small. Two-thirds of the machine means you should select medium, and if you fill up the whole machine, you should select large. Never squish clothes down so that you can fit more in. You should just run another load with your extra clothes or else you could risk jamming the machine or damaging it in some other way."

This cycle washes with warm water and ends with cooler water, which keeps your colors looking bright. Delicate: As you might guess, anything that is relatively delicate (bras, dry-fit wear, cotton sweaters, dress shirts, etc.) Always make sure that your delicates do not require you to dry-clean or hand wash them (check the tag to make sure.)"

You can either add your clothes and pour the right washing fluid on them, or keep your clothes out of the washer, fill the washer \u2153 of the way with water, add the washing fluid, and then add the clothes. Detergent: The amount of detergent you put in your washing machine is determined by how large your load is. Generally, detergent lids act as cups that have marked off amounts. Generally, \u2153 of the cup should be filled with detergent for a small load, \u2154 for a medium load, and a full cup for a large load. However, read your specific detergent bottle for instructions on how to use that detergent--some detergents are more concentrated than others, meaning you don\u2019t need to use as much. Bleach: Bleach is used when you want to get tough stains out of clothes, or you want your whites to be really, really white. There are two kinds of bleach. Chlorine bleach is good for really making your whites white but should never be used on any colored fabric. All-fabric bleach can be used on colored fabrics. Fabric softener: Fabric softener can be added during the rinse cycle. Some machines have a dispenser where you can pour the softener when you begin the wash cycle, and it will add it to the rinse cycle at the right time."

Like the washing machine, the dryer also has settings that you have to wade through to dry your clothes. Add a dryer sheet and close the door. Regular/heavy: White clothes are best dried on the regular/heavy setting. White clothes are generally pre-shrunk and can handle the more intense and higher heat drying system (unlike colors which fade under high heat.) Permanent press: This is better for regular colored clothes. The medium heat and pressure makes sure that your clothes don\u2019t fade. Delicate: Any clothes that you washed on the delicate setting should be dried on the delicate setting.
