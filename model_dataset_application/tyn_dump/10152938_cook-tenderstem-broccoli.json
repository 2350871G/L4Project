  "text":" Cleaning the Broccoli Break the florets off of the main stalk. Use either your hands or a knife to break the stalk of tenderstem broccoli into smaller pieces. Aim to create bite-sized pieces of tenderstem broccoli. Don\u2019t trim the stems. Unlike regular broccoli that has a woody stem, tenderstem broccoli has a soft and nutritious stem, so you want to leave as much as you can. Leave the whole stem on the broccoli to get the most flavor and nutrition. Wash your broccoli in the sink. Place the broccoli in a strainer, so you don\u2019t have to hold it the whole time. Rinse the florets under cold water to clean off any dirt that may still be present. Rotate the pieces of broccoli so the water coats them entirely. Use cold water when you rinse the broccoli so it doesn\u2019t soften up. Saut\u00e9ing the Broccoli Warm 1  tsp (4.9 ml) of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle the olive oil so it evenly coats the pan. Heat the oil until it begins to sizzle. You can substitute any other cooking oil instead of using olive oil. Toss the broccoli florets in the pan with the oil. Use a wooden spoon to stir and coat the broccoli in oil. Mix \u20442 pound (230 g) of chopped asparagus into the pan for added flavor and greens. Let the broccoli cook for 2 to 3 minutes, tossing it repeatedly. Continue to stir the oil and broccoli so it cooks evenly. After 2 or 3 minutes, your broccoli should be bright green and it will be easy to pierce the stems with a knife. Cook the broccoli for less time if you want it to be crunchier rather than soft. Add 1 tbsp (14 g) of butter to the pan and coat the broccoli. Stir the butter into the pan so it melts and completely covers the florets. Keep moving the butter and broccoli around so the butter doesn\u2019t burn on the bottom of the pan.Use unsalted butter if desired. If you use salted butter, use less salt when you season the broccoli in the next step. Remove the broccoli from the pan and season it with salt and Parmesan cheese. Transfer the broccoli to a serving plate or bowl and sprinkle it with salt and 2 tablespoons (10 g) of Parmesan cheese. After seasoning the broccoli, stir it so each piece is flavored evenly. Warm the serving plate in the microwave to keep your broccoli hot. Purchase pre-grated Parmesan cheese to make your recipe easier. Roasting the Broccoli Place the tenderstem broccoli on a cooking tray. Spread the broccoli out on the tray so they are not bunched up. This helps ensure that they get an even roast once you place them in the oven. Line the tray with aluminum foil so you can clean-up easily. Once the broccoli is done cooking, simply remove the aluminum foil once it\u2019s cool and throw it away. Crush 3 cloves of garlic with the side of a knife and put them on the tray. Place the cloves on a cutting board. Put the blade of a chef\u2019s knife flat on top of a clove and apply firm pressure to crush it. Repeat the process for each clove and spread them out evenly on the tray. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil lightly over the broccoli. Coat all of the florets with the olive oil and then use your hands to mix the broccoli so the oil is evenly distributed on every piece. You can use any cooking oil as a substitute for olive oil. Cook the broccoli at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 12 minutes. Put the tray on the center rack of the oven and set your timer for 12 minutes. When the broccoli is finished roasting, it will have a bright green color and the stems should be slightly crunchy. Season the broccoli with salt and chili flakes. Sprinkle the broccoli with 1 pinch of salt and chili flakes at a time. Stir the broccoli once you add the spices so it is evenly seasoned. Taste test the seasonings after each pinch until you\u2019re happy with the flavor. Use more chili flakes to make your broccoli spicier. Steaming Tenderstems in the Microwave Place the florets in a microwave-safe bowl. Use a bowl made of glass or ceramic in your microwave. Place the amount of broccoli you want inside the bowl, but do not overfill it past the lip. Ceramic and glass bowls will get hot once you microwave them. Make sure to use an oven mitt when you take them out. If the broccoli is too large for the bowl, cut off the ends of the stems. Keep the cut stems in the bowl to cook them rather than throwing them away. Add 3 US tbsp (44 ml) of water for every 1 lb (450 g) of broccoli. Use a measuring spoon to add the water to the bowl until you have the correct amount. Cover the bowl entirely with a lid or plate. Make sure the bowl is sealed so steam cannot escape once it is microwaved. Use a lid meant to fit the bowl or cover it with a microwave-safe dish. In a pinch, you can use plastic wrap to cover your bowl. Microwave the broccoli on high for 3 to 3.5 minutes. When your broccoli is finished, it should still be crispy and bright green. If you don\u2019t know the power of your microwave, try cooking the broccoli for 2.5 minutes first. Check to see if they\u2019re finished cooking and if not, cook them for another minute. Tenderstem broccoli will be bright green once they are finished cooking. Remove the bowl carefully. Season the broccoli with butter and salt. Use an oven mitt to remove the bowl from the microwave and take off the lid. Mix in 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter for every 1 pound (450 g) of broccoli, and then season it with salt until you\u2019re happy with the flavor. Add a splash of soy sauce for extra flavor.",
