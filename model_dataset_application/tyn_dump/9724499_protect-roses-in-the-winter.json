This is a popular technique among rose gardeners, known as \u201chardening off.\u201d Reduce the water by half and stop fertilizing altogether to help prepare your roses for the cold weather. The reduction will help thicken their plant cell walls, giving them a purplish cast. You can look up your first and last frost dates by entering your zipcode at https://davesgarden.com/guides/freeze-frost-dates/#b. Stop cutting roses in early fall to let hips and seed pods develop. Don\u2019t deadhead or clip any blooms, starting around August, in order to let the plant naturally harden off. Your roses should start developing tough growth-like hips and seed pods, which will help the plant last the winter. In the Southern Hemisphere, early fall occurs in March.

Once the temperature has consistently stayed around 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C) for 3-4 days, you can prune and start preparing to winterize your roses. Prune back any long canes to about 5 ft (1.5 m). With your clean, sharp pruning shears, make a cut at a 45\u00b0 angle.

Hilling Rose Bushes Use this technique on hybrid tea roses, grandifloras, and floribundas. These varieties require some extra work and insulation. The hilling technique insulates and covers the rose bush, keeping it frozen and protecting it from the sunlight and wind. Bring in well-drained soil from outside your garden. You don\u2019t want to scrape up the soil around the plant, since this can damage the root system and decrease the plant\u2019s chances of survival. Instead, buy bagged, well-drained topsoil from a local gardening or home improvement store. \u201cWell-drained\u201d soil simply means it has a good structure, with gaps between the soil particles to allow air and water to flow easily. You can also use compost or straw in place of soil. If you live in a particularly cold area, you may want to add an additional straw cover to your topsoil or mulch. Use a shovel to pile 1 ft (30 cm) of soil around the base of the plant. Fill your shovel with the well-drained soil you brought in earlier and mound it up around the base of the rose bush. Keep adding more soil until you\u2019ve covered the canes with a small mound, about 1 ft (30 cm) high and 1 ft (30 cm) wide.

You can find your first thaw date by searching your zip code on https://davesgarden.com/guides/freeze-frost-dates/#b. Bundling and Wrapping Climbing Roses Bundle and tie your climbing roses with zip ties or cotton string. Group together 2-3 canes and gently secure them together for support against the wind. Make sure to keep your zip ties or cotton string loose so they don\u2019t abrade the plant. Wrap the bundles with dry straw and burlap. Add a layer of dry straw around the canes, then wrap them carefully in a sheet of burlap. Secure the burlap with twine or wire to keep everything in place. Pile up 1 ft (30 cm) of well-drained soil or compost around the base. Use the hilling technique to protect the plant\u2019s roots and crown.

You can look up the date of your first thaw by entering your zip code at https://davesgarden.com/guides/freeze-frost-dates/#b. Winterizing Other Rose Varieties Pile 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of dry leaves over mini rose plants. For the smallest variety, which won\u2019t be affected too much by the wind, all you need to do is provide a little protection from potential thawing and refreezing. Once the mini roses are completely dormant, cover the sides and tops with dried leaves. Make sure the leaves are dry, since dampness can lead to disease and mold.
