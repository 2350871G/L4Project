But if you have an idea in mind of what you\u2019d like it to look like, try making your own sewing pattern. If you do this, make sure to factor in seam allowances and duplicate pieces (like for ears and limbs). You could also familiarize yourself with a similar stuffed animal pattern to help give yourself some guidance if you\u2019ve never created a pattern before. Some toy cats are made of a single shape and don\u2019t have arms and legs that you can move. Others have separate arms, legs, head, tail, and even ears. Keep in mind that the more pieces your pattern has, the more complex it will be to make. If you\u2019ve never made a stuffed animal before, you may want to opt for a simpler pattern. If you already have a toy cat that you love, you could copy its pattern and use that for your project."

Tracing the sewing pattern lets you make any adjustments you\u2019d like to. Also, using the right kind of paper will make it easier to work with the fabric later on. A lot of sewing-pattern papers are very thin and easy to see through, and they also are more flexible than other kinds of paper. If you\u2019re using a pattern with separate pieces, mark down what each piece is so you don\u2019t get confused later on."

Place sewing pins along the edge of the pattern every 2 inches (5.1 cm) or so, making sure that their ends don\u2019t extend out past the edge of the pattern. Use your sharp sewing scissors to carefully cut out the pattern from the fabric. Once the fabric is cut out, you can remove the pins and put the pattern away somewhere for safekeeping. Repeat this step for each part of your pattern. If you just have a body for your cat, you\u2019ll only need to do this once. But the arms, legs, tail, and ears will need to be cut out separately, too. Keep in mind that many pieces, like legs, arms, and ears, will actually need to be cut out twice, since you\u2019ll need 2 of each thing."

Use your sewing pins all along the edges of the fabric, taking care to make sure the edges are lining up neatly. The great thing about making your own toy cat is that you can choose whatever kind and color of fabric you like! Solid colors like brown, gray, black, or tan may look more like a traditional cat; or, you could have fun picking out patterned fabric to make a cat that is a little more unique to you. You\u2019ll need to leave 1 section open at the end, about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) long, through which you can turn the cat right-side out and stuff it with batting. Keep in mind where you\u2019d like that section to be so you don\u2019t accidentally sew the entire thing shut."

Use your machine\u2019s triple stitch option, which should look like 3 vertical dashed lines. This will provide a lot of extra reinforcement and should help prolong the life of your cat. Choose a short stitch length. Leave yourself about a \u20444 to \u20442 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) hem. If you don\u2019t have a sewing machine, you could definitely stitch together your cat manually. It will take a little longer, but it could be fun to do everything by hand. The exact stitch length might vary based on the type of fabric you use. For example, lightweight fabrics can have a longer stitch length than heavier fabrics. After the fabric is sewn together, you can go ahead and remove the sewing pins."

Each notch should stop about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) before the stitches. If you don\u2019t have pinking shears, you can use a regular pair of scissors to cut out triangles all around the edges of the fabric for the same effect.

Run your iron over the entire piece of fabric, paying special attention to the sewn edges. Let the fabric cool down completely before you move on to the next step.

    "You may also want to do something like create eyes out of buttons or add felt to the ears for a special touch.",
    "Don\u2019t be afraid to really reinforce those ending stitches to make sure the limbs will all stay in place.",
    "Your pattern may have called for the limbs to be sewn into the body earlier.",
    "if that is the case, you don\u2019t need to worry about attaching them at this point.",
    "Sewing them into the body does create a stronger connection, but you can make your toy cat through either method.",
    "Care for your cat by keeping it clean and repairing it when necessary.",
    "If you do need to wash your cat, put it into a mesh laundry bag and wash it in cool water on the gentle cycle, then hang it up to dry.",
    "If you notice loose threads or sections that need to be sewn together again, take a moment to fix your cat to keep it in the best condition possible.",
    "Of course, don\u2019t forget to play with your toy cat, too!",
    "After all, that\u2019s what you made it for."
