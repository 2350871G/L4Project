Puncture the silver skin of the pork with a filet knife. Hold the skin with one hand as you cut it off with the knife. \u201dSilver skin\u201d is the thick membrane on the exterior of the pork, which is too tough and chewy to eat. Failing to remove the membrane layer can result in your roast cooking unevenly. Cut the meat into cubes. Slice up the pork into two- to three-inch chunks. Trim off and discard any excess fat as you come across it. Place the cubed meat into your crockpot. Add brown rice to the crockpot. Use regular brown rice, not \u201cminute\u201d rice. Adding rice at this stage is optional. You can make the rice separately later, but simply adding it to your slow cooker can save you time. Substitute white or jasmine rice for the brown rice, if desired. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients to the crock pot. Pour soy sauce, sesame oil and broth into the slow cooker. Add your garlic and grated ginger. Pour in fish sauce, if desired. Stir the ingredients. If you want the sauce to have a bit of sweetness, mix in a sprinkle of brown sugar.

Remove the pork only from your crock pot. Put it on a clean work surface. Place two dinner forks back-to-back into the pork. Pull the forks opposite ways, breaking up and shredding the meat. Take off any pieces of gristle you may run into, and discard them. Making Meatballs Prepare the oven and a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). Cover a baking sheet with foil. Spray the foil with a thin coating of non-stick cooking spray. Use an oven thermometer if you\u2019re unsure of your oven\u2019s temperature reliability. Combine ground pork with other ingredients. Clean your hands well. Add egg, breadcrumbs, and soy sauce to the pork. Use your hands to mix in the minced garlic, grated ginger and sliced pepper and onions. Remove any jewelry from your hands and put it aside in a safe place. Wash your hands thoroughly, making sure to scrub underneath your nails. Form and cook the meatballs. Form the meatballs using one tablespoon of the meat mixture for each meatball. Arrange them on your prepared baking sheet. Cook them in the preheated oven for twenty-five minutes. You should get about 30 meatballs. Make sure to wash your hands well with soap and water after handling the raw meat and pepper mixture. Assembling the Bowls Cook the brown rice, if applicable. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Add the rice. Cover the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low. Let it simmer for 45 minutes, or as long as the directions instruct. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to sit, covered, for fifteen minutes. Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork.

Alternately, mix it all together into one large, covered container. Reheat it in the oven or microwave, if desired. Use the leftovers cold as filling for a sandwich!
