Invitation suites are available in many paper colors and designs, ranging from traditional formal invitations to casual themed invitations. Order at least 20 to 25 percent more invitation suites than you plan to send. This allows for extra pieces in the event of mistakes as you are printing them. For example, if you plan to print 100 invitations, order 125 invitation suites."

This is a less expensive option than an invitation suite and offers design versatility. Order at least 25 to 50 additional pieces of cardstock to allow for printing mistakes. Order envelopes for the invitations and enclosures. An invitation suite comes with envelopes for the invitations and enclosures, but if you are making your own invitations from cardstock, you will need to order the envelopes separately. For example, if you want guests to mail back a response card, you need to supply an envelope that fits the response card. Some couples choose to use outer envelopes and inner envelopes. The outer envelopes are addressed, while the inner envelopes protect the invitation and enclosures. If you are using both outer and inner envelopes, be sure to order the correct quantities and sizes for your invitations."

Do not add layering papers to pre-cut invitation suites, as the final invitation size may not fit in the envelopes provided with the invitation suite."

Try different font combinations and font treatments, such as italics, lowercase and uppercase typeface. Try different font sizes. The font size is how big the text appears on the invitation. Because fonts vary in typeface size, it is difficult to provide a suggested font size for invitations. As a rule of thumb, avoid font sizes smaller than 9 point.

For crisp, high quality graphics, use only high resolution images. Incorporate graphic elements that carry out the theme of your wedding.
