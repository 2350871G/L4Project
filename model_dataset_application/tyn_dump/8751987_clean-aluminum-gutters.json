If you can lean the ladder against the house\u2019s main structure rather than the gutters, do this to entirely avoid leaning on the gutters. If you're putting your ladder up in a soft or landscaped area, put a piece of plywood underneath the feet. This will help keep the legs stable and minimize the risk of falls."

If you don\u2019t have a small trowel, find an empty plastic bottle with a sturdy handle. Cut the bottom and part of the side out to form a scoop. Set up a large garbage can or a tarp on the ground for a place to dump the leaves as you clean. Throw the leaves on the compost pile if you have one, or discard them in the garbage. Be careful using a trowel over joints or downspouts, and too much force could cause damage to these connections. Lean to your right and left, scooping as much as you can without moving the ladder. Be careful not to lean so far that you get off balance. Ladder safety is always important."
