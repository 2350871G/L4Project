If you live in a colder climate, plant your broccoli in the spring so you can pick in the early to late summertime. In warmer climates, you have more freedom and can harvest into autumn. In general, expect to harvest broccoli about 55 to 60 days after planting. Watch the growth of the broccoli carefully and harvest them when they reach 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) wide. Broccoli is a cool-season crop that harvests best in most climates during the spring or fall. Remember this in advance so you can pick during an optimum season."

For best taste, pick strictly in the morning before the soil heats up. If you live in a colder or less sunny climate, you can pick in the middle of the day without major concerns.

If you cut at an angle, your plant will grow more side shoots within a few days. Because fresh broccoli needs to be eaten within a small window, you may want to harvest over the course of a week rather than all at once. The exception to this is if your plant has yellowed considerably and you suspect it will soon flower. Preferably, plan on harvesting before your plant shows yellow streaks. If it already has, harvest as much as you can immediately but check the stalks in several days for more shoots.

If you do not see any additional shoots, the first harvest may have caused too much damage to the plant. After a week of no shoot growth, pull the plant and compost it.

Because your refrigerator is dry, put your broccoli in a perforated plastic bag in your crisper. Frozen broccoli can be stored in your freezer for up to a year.
