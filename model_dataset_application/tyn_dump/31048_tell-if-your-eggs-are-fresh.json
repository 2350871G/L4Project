Fresh eggs will have milky or clear whites and a perky bright yellow or orange yolk. If the egg is rotten, the whites will be thin and watery or may look pink and the yolk will flatten out. The appearance of small red or brown spots, known as blood spots, does not mean the egg is rotten. This is normal and actually means that the egg is most likely very fresh."
