You will need a square of fabric approximately 14 inches (35.6 cm) square for a large dog and as small as 8 inches (20.3 cm) square for a bandanna for a smaller dog. Cut the fabric into a square. The diagonal of the square will be two times the length of the bandana, so if you want a 5 inch (12.7 cm) long bandana, cut a square with a diagonal length of 11 inches (27.9 cm). (two x five inches + one inch to allow for the sewing seams) Place the square with printed side down on a flat surface.  Fold two opposite corners in approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) in toward the center. This should leave a folded edge of approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) long at the corner. Pin in place. Stitch the folded corners down close to their raw edges.  Fold the bandana diagonally with printed sides facing each other and unsewn corners together. This should line up your raw edges and leave the previously folded and sewn corners opposite each other. Pin and sew the raw edges together to form the point of the bandana.
