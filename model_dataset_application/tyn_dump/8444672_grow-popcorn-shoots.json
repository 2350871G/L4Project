To help establish the correct amount, spread dry seed into the bottom of the empty tray you\u2019ll use to grow the shoots. They should be evenly but densely spread, just barely covering the bottom surface of the tray. As a general guideline, use 1/4-1/3 cup for a 5x5in (13x13cm) tray. Use 1-1 1/2 cup for an 10x10in (25x25cm) tray, and 2-3 cups for a tray that\u2019s 10x20in (25x50cm). If you\u2019re growing your seeds in a hot, humid climate, you may need to use a bit less seed. While plenty of seeds usually works wonderfully, mold may be more likely to grow between closely-spaced shoots in more tropical climates."

Essentially, you want all of the soil to be wet, but without water puddling on the surface of the soil. Use your fingers to disperse water throughout the soil when you water the plants. Mix earthworm castings, which can be found online or at gardening stores, into your soil for added nutrients.

If, during your first grow, you have issues with mold or fungus growing between your shoots, use fewer seeds the next time around and reduce how often you water them.
