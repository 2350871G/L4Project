If this doesn\u2019t work, place them into a colander under a running faucet. Shake the colander to help remove the stuck-on dirt. Once clean, place the mushrooms on a towel or mesh rack and leave them to dry for 24 hours.If you need to rinse your mushrooms in water, use whatever temperature is comfortable. Use your hands to help wash the dirt off the mushrooms while they\u2019re under the faucet."
