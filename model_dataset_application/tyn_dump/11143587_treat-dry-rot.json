          "description":"If you've caught an instance of dry rot early enough, it can be stopped with boric acid. Boric acid is a powerful fungicide and can eradicate the rot-causing fungi as long as they haven't penetrated more than \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) into the wood. Sprinkle the boric acid over the rotting portion of your wood or timber and leave it there for 2\u20133 days. Dry rot typically looks like puffy, white mold growing out of timber or other wooden surfaces. The rot occasionally \u201cblooms\u201d and produces cobweb-like strands that hang from the rotting wood or yellow-colored lumps of fungal growth. In serious cases of dry rot, you may notice that the wood simply crumbles away. Purchase boric acid at a large hardware store or home-improvement store. Many large grocery stores also stock boric acid. Check in the store's cleaning or household-goods aisle."

You'll need to scrape away the rotted wood, which will take the rot-causing fungus with it. Place a bit into the trim router, then plug it in. Hold the router vertically over the timber and turn it on. Move it smoothly back and forth over the rotted area so the router gouges out all of the rotten wood.
