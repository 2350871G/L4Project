          "description":"To go from a dark surface to a lighter stain, you\u2019ll need to apply a chemical wood stripper first. You can buy stripper at any home improvement store. Brush a thick coat of stripper onto the surface, then let it sit for 30 minutes to dissolve the finish. Use a plastic scraper or stiff-bristled brush to scrape off the dissolved finish. Work in a well-ventilated room. Wear goggles and protective gloves when using stripper. Scrub the surface thoroughly with a mild detergent solution and steel wool before proceeding. Refer to your stripper product\u2019s instructions for additional details."

If you\u2019re applying gel stain over an existing finish, mix equal parts water and denatured alcohol to create a cleaning solution. Dip a microfiber cloth into it and wipe the surface down. Wipe off excess liquid with a paper towel. Create a mild soap solution by combining 1 cup (240 ml) water with 1 teaspoon of mild dish detergent.

          "description":"After using medium grit sandpaper, sand the surface again using a fine grit, like 320-grit or 400-grit. The fine grit sandpaper gets rid of any remaining imperfections in the wood and gives you a perfectly smooth surface for applying the gel stain. If you\u2019re working with a raw wood finish, follow up with 150-grit sandpaper. Using anything finer than that may prevent the surface from holding the stain well."
