Don\u2019t worry about making it too detailed, just sketch the basic shape. For example, if you want to paint a gold vase, just paint the outline of the overall shape as well as lines that represent any unique features, such as where the vase gets narrower and the metal dips inwards."

Use a medium-sized paintbrush to apply the paint to areas of the object where there are highlights. Highlights are wherever the most light would be hitting the object. For instance, if you are painting a gold vase, imagine that the light is shining on it from the left side of the page. The highlights would be on the inside of the lip of the vase at the right side of the page and towards the left side of the outside of the vase. Keep in mind that gold is very reflective and thus has very strong highlights. The brightest parts of the highlights can appear almost white."

Use this to paint shadows on the areas of the object where the light doesn\u2019t hit. For example, if you are painting a gold vase with the light coming from the left side of your canvas or paper, paint shadows on the far right side of the outside of the vase and on the inside of the left side of the lip. If you look at shadows on a real gold object, you will notice they are often almost red in color.

It helps to look at a picture of a gold object or have a real gold object in front of you while you do this so you can see how the light reflects off of it and creates different hues.
