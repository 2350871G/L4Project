Pour the chocolate and egg mixtures into the center of the flour mixture. Use a spoon to stir the mixtures together. Keep stirring until all the ingredients are thoroughly blended. Pour the batter into a greased, microwave-safe glass pan. Make sure the pan you use is small enough to fit in your microwave. Spread the batter out in the pan so it\u2019s even. For an even better-tasting brownie, sprinkle chocolate chips on top of the batter before you bake it. Place the pan in the microwave and bake on high for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, remove the brownies and check to see if they\u2019re done. If there\u2019s still liquid on top of the surface, put them back in the microwave for 1-2 more minutes. Let the brownies cool for 3 minutes before serving. Once the brownies have cooled down, cut them into slices using a knife. Scoop the slices out of the pan and serve.",
