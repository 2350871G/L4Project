Tap the knife\u2019s handle with a hammer as needed to push it further into the joint. Then, move the knife all the way around the window to break the paint seal. If your window has a top and bottom sash, start with the lower one. A utility knife also works well for most windows, but may not be able to cut through thicker beads of paint. Another option is a specialty blade called a window zipper, available at many hardware stores."

After cutting through the paint, you may be able to open the window by hand again. If going outside isn\u2019t possible, leave the exterior alone and focus on what you are able to reach.

Forcing it is a sure way to break it. If it feels stuck, try something else."

Tap the pry bar with a hammer as needed to get it further into the joint. Then, gently try to leverage the window up. If you feel the window loosening, try moving the pry bar. Work on the sash\u2019s other corner before prying up the middle section. Sometimes applying force in a few different spots is enough to get the window open. To reduce the possibility of damage, stop prying the window if it feels stuck in place. Remove the window stops and possibly the sash itself to repair the window."

They come in spray bottles, so all you have to do is point the nozzle at the tracks on either side of the window sash. Spray them with an even coating of lubricant to make the sash easier to open and shut. Lubricants are available online or at many home improvement stores. Look for ones with graphite, Teflon, silicone, or similar products. Once you have lubricated the sash, continue opening and closing it. The more you use it, the more it loosens. Another way to lubricate the tracks is with a wax candle. Wipe the candle stub over the track for a mess-free lubricant."

The knife will chip the paint a little, but the damage often isn\u2019t significant and fixing the window is well worth it. Be careful when working in older homes. Many homes built before 1980 have lead paint. To avoid lead exposure, rent a vacuum with a HEPA filter from a home improvement store and use it to clean up paint chips.

Wear down the frame until it looks roughly level. Avoid touching the glass with the sandpaper, since it could lead to scratches. If you see any holes in the frame from rot, fill them in now with wood putty or epoxy, then sand the area flat again. Prime and paint the sash the frame.
