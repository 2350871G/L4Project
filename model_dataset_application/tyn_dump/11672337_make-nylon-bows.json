          "description":"Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors. You can measure and mark the fabric with a piece of chalk first, or measure and cut as you go. Keep in mind that each section of the nylon or pantyhose will be a slightly different width, so you may want to cut from a few different areas to find the ideal size. For example, cuttings from the foot and ankle area are better for a baby\u2019s headband. Cuttings from the calf work well for a child-sized headband, and cuttings from the thigh may be best for an adult-sized headband. You can vary the width of the bands. For example, create narrow bands by cutting \u20444 in (0.64 cm) strips and wider bands by cutting 2 in (5.1 cm) strips.Tip: Begin warming up your hot glue gun while you cut the nylons. It takes around 10-15 minutes for a hot glue gun to warm up."
