A darker background peeking through your gold typically looks more intentional than a light background, which may look more like an incomplete gold application. It\u2019s totally up to you though. If desired, you can use a small, flat soft-bristled brush to paint a white canvas another color with acrylic paints. What color you\u2019d like peeking through your gold leaf is up to you."

The adhesive should be spread thin enough to be translucent rather than milky on the canvas. Try not to go back over areas where you\u2019ve already applied adhesive.
