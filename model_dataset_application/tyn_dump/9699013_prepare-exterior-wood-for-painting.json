Cut sheet plastic to fit over each opening and secure the edges using painters tape. Not only will this keep the areas you don\u2019t want to paint covered, it will also help protect more delicate fixtures from damage.

Smaller spots can be treated the same way, or you can purchase an exterior spackling compound, which won\u2019t require any additional mixing. For most basic applications, the wood filler will dry in a few hours. Two-part resin systems tend to stick to exterior wood better than ordinary fillers.

Run a hooked scraper along the places where the old paint is peeling to shave it away. Make sure you keep your strokes moving with the grain\u2014otherwise, you run the risk of splintering the wood. Continue scraping until there are no protrusions on the face of the exterior. The sharper the scraper, the easier it will be to remove the failing paint. For best results, equip yourself with a scraper that has a hardened steel or carbide edge."

          "description":"After scraping, you\u2019ll notice that the remaining paint forms a ridge around the exposed wood. You can do away with these imperfections easily using a handheld power sander. Start with a low-grit sandpaper of around 60-grit or so to grind down sharper edges. Then, switch to a high-grit paper (100-grit or higher) and smooth the paint down to the underlying wood. It\u2019s not necessary to sand the contours all the way down to the wood\u2014just \u201cfeather\u201d them lightly so that the edges gradually disappear.

These spots should be brushed with a special resin-blocking primer to prevent discoloration. Apply the primer over any sections of the wood where the grain looks particularly dark or wet. Even with a resin-blocking primer, it\u2019s advisable to use 2-3 coats to conceal potential bleeding when it comes time to paint the surface."

Be sure to hit corners, recesses, molding, and any other features you intend to paint, as well. It\u2019s not necessary to remove the old paint. A thorough sanding should rough up the exterior enough to help fresh coats stick."

The surface should be totally free of debris when you're finished. A shop vacuum with a brush attachment might help you collect more dust from broad areas. Drag your finger along the wood to make sure no traces of dust remain. Paint has a hard time adhering to surfaces that are coated with lots of fine particles."

Seal each opening using a caulk gun loaded with silicone sealant. The caulk will harden within an hour, keeping the structure off-limits from rain, mold, bugs, and drafts. The caulk you use should be paintable, able to withstand both high and low temperatures, and suitable for the materials it\u2019s binding.
