Then, carefully cut the rack of ribs into serving portions that are 2-3 ribs each. If you do not want to trim and portion the ribs yourself, ask your local butcher if they would mind prepping the rack of ribs for you.

Use your fingers as needed to rub the seasoning into the meat to get it to stick. Regardless of what cooking method you use, it is important to at least season the ribs with salt and pepper. Otherwise, your meat will taste bland after it is finished cooking. If you are planning to use a dry-rub to season your ribs, then incorporate the salt and pepper into the dry-rub instead."

Instead of using a store-bought dry rub, create your own! For example, create a pepper barbecue rub by mixing together 1/4 cup (28.75 g) of paprika, 1 tbsp (5.4) of ground cumin, 1 tbsp (12.5 g) of brown sugar, packed, 1 tbsp (5.4 g) of chili powder, 1 tbsp (5.4) of ground black pepper, 1 1/2 tsp (3.15 g) cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp (0.5 g) of ground cloves in a bowl.

          "description":"Pick sauces that are sweet, spicy, or tangy to complement the flavors of the pork. If you are using a dry rub on the ribs, then think about what sauce will complement the seasonings used in the dry rub. Either purchase your favorite sauce from your local grocery store or consider making a homemade sauce if you have the time. For example, create a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce by placing 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil and 1/4 cup (37.5 g) of minced onion into a saucepan over a medium heat. Cook the onions until they are tender. Then, stir in 1/2 tsp (1.05 g) ground cumin, \u20442 cup (120 mL) of ketchup, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of hot chili sauce, 2 tbsp (25 g) of light brown sugar, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar, and salt and ground black pepper to taste. Allow this to cook for 2 minutes before removing it from the heat and setting it aside. Unless you are cooking the ribs in a slow cooker, refrain from applying the sauce until the ribs are fully cooked. Otherwise, the sauce will burn and ruin your ribs."

    "Place any leftovers in a sealable container and store them for up to a week in the refrigerator.",
    "Making Crockpot Ribs Pour \u20442 cup (120 mL) of water into your crockpot.",
    "While cooking, the ribs will secrete a lot of juice, but the water will keep them from sticking as the juices cook off.",
    "Just make sure that your crockpot can support the size of your ribs.",
    "Have a crockpot that can hold at least 6 US quarts (5,700 mL).",
    "Consider seasoning the water with 1/2 of a sliced onion and 1 minced clove of garlic.",

    "Substitute the water with an equal amount of chicken broth to enhance the natural pork flavor.",
    "Use 2 cups (470 mL) of your chosen sauce to cook the ribs in.",
    "The juices from the ribs will water-down the sauce, but the seasonings from the sauce will greatly flavor the meat.",
    "Stand the ribs inside of the crockpot, so the meat is against the pot.",
    "Arrange your ribs so that they are vertical in your crockpot.",
    "Rest any thick, meaty ends along the bottom.",
    "If placed correctly, the meat-side of the rib will be against the pot and the bone-side will be facing inward.",
    "If your ribs do not fit vertically in the crockpot, simply layer the portions within the pot, putting the thicker ones along the bottom.",

    "Alternatively, cook the ribs on a high setting for 4 hours.",
    "This is ideal for meals that were planned at the last minute.",
    "Remove the ribs from the crockpot and place them on a serving platter.",
    "Use a pair of heat-resistant tongs to take the ribs out of the crockpot.",
    "Be careful when doing this as the meat may fall off the bones very easily if jostled.",
    "Rest the ribs on a serving platter and enjoy!",
    "If you cooked your ribs in a sauce, spoon the thinned sauce onto the ribs or serve it on the side to dip the meat into.",
    "If you did not cook your ribs in a sauce, then take some time before serving the ribs to coat them in your choice of sauce.",
    "Make sure to coat both sides evenly.",
    "Remember to turn off and unplug your crockpot when you are finished using it.",
    "Allow it time to cool off before storing it away.",
    "Store any leftovers in a sealable container and keep them in the refrigerator for about a week.",

    "Heat your gas or charcoal grill as you normally would.",
    "If needed, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for how to preheat your particular grill.",
    "If you have a smoker box for your grill, consider prepping this with some wood chips to further flavor your meat.",
    "For example, apple wood chips greatly complement the natural flavors of the pork.",
    "Place your seasoned, portioned ribs bone-side down onto the grill.",
    "Use a pair of heat-resistant tongs to place the ribs on the grill rack.",
    "Do not place the ribs directly over the flame, as this will cook the meat quickly.",
    "Instead, only have half of your burners turned on and cook the ribs on the side of the grill rack where the burners are off.",
    "If your grill has a top rack, place the ribs there instead.",
    "Cook the ribs over the indirect heat for 2-3 hours at 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C).",
    "Close the lid on the grill and allow the ribs to cook.",
    "Check on the ribs every hour to make sure that they are not burning and are cooking properly.",
    "When done, the internal temperature of the meat will be about 190\u2013200 \u00b0F (88\u201393 \u00b0C) and the meat will be tender.",
    "Do not walk away from your grill for long periods, as this is considered a fire hazard.",
    "Coat the ribs in your selected sauce during the last 20 minutes of cooking.",
    "Use a sauce mop to apply the sauce to one side of the ribs, and then let it cook for 5 minutes to adhere.",
    "Flip the ribs over using a pair of heat-resistant tongs, and apply the sauce to the second side.",
    "Let the ribs cook for another 5 minutes, and repeat the process a second time to baste the ribs further.",

    "Use your heat-resistant tongs to take the ribs off the grill and place them onto a serving platter.",
    "Allow the ribs to rest in their juices for 10 minutes before cutting or serving them.",
    "Apply additional sauce to the ribs before serving if desired or serve some of the sauce on the side to dip the meat into.",
    "Store any leftovers in a sealable container and keep them in the refrigerator for about a week."
