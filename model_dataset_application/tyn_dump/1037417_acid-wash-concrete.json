Phosphoric acid creates less fumes. Use it in rooms that contain stainless steel or other acid-vulnerable metals. It's also a good choice if you're just cleaning off mineral deposits. Muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) is the most dangerous option and produces strong fumes. Recommended only for professionals working outdoors."

Protect your lungs with a respirator with an acid-grade filter, and use fans to improve ventilation if necessary. Protect exposed skin with well-fitting clothing at minimum, and ideally with a face shield plus a PVC or Butyl coverall or apron. Keep water nearby to wash spills from skin or clothing. Showers and an eye wash station are ideal. Keep baking soda or garden lime nearby to neutralize spills on the ground."

Defer to the manufacturer\u2019s directions on the acid container over the guidelines below. These general ratios are suited to some mixes but not all:\nSulfamic acid: 1 pound powder or crystals per 1 gallon hot water (120 grams per 1 L water). Phosphoric acid: dilute to 20\u201340%. Muriatic acid: mix 3 to 4 parts water with 1 part acid, or follow label instructions for a 10% concentration (15% for hard, smooth concrete). These solutions are for etching the concrete. If you're just removing mineral deposits (efflorescence), use a much weaker mix (10:1 or 16:1 for muriatic acid)."

Scrub this over the concrete and let sit at least ten minute to ensure that all the acid is neutralized. Pay particular attention to the edges and any low spots in the concrete.

Use a hose to rinse the acid rather than a pressure washer. These can drive acid deep into the concrete. To be safe, test the final rinse water with a pH test strip. If it is below 6.0, there is too much acid and the floor needs more rinsing. (Less commonly, a result above 9.0 means you've added too much basic neutralizer.)"

Slowly stir in more acid and base as needed until the mixture stops fizzing. Once neutralized, you can pour it down the sink or storm drain. Hose off any equipment or clothing that may have touched the acid. If you do not have plans for the rest of the pure acid, you may want to dispose of it the same way.
