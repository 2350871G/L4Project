If you are using a clear, square shaped pegboard, you should slide a pattern underneath before beading, or you could create a freeform design of your own making. When using a pattern beneath your pegboard, it's important to make sure the pattern is properly aligned with the pegs. Each bead represented by the pattern should center around a peg. You might make use of a realistic color scheme, or you might choose wacky colors to give your creation character. Your imagination's the limit! Due to the fact that the pegs of your Perler pegboard are so small, it's very easy for you to jostle the board and knock your beads loose. To prevent this, you may want to lay a non-slip craft mat beneath your beading project. You can put your Perler beads onto the pegs in any way that works best for you, but you may want to consider working from the bottom up or top down. Working from the outside in can crowd the empty pegs on the inside of the board, which may cause you to accidentally knock beads off of pegs."
