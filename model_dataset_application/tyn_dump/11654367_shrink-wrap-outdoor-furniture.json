          "description":"Your patio or yard are excellent places to work. You can do this on a porch if you have enough space, but you need room to walk around your furniture and apply your shrink wrap. Clear an area to work and give yourself at least 10\u201315 feet (3.0\u20134.6 m) to move. Remove any outdoor rugs, flower pots, or garden fixtures that may get in the way. If you\u2019re using a roll of shrink film to package your furniture for moving, you don\u2019t need to use a heat gun. That means you can do this inside if you prefer. You still need plenty of room to work, though. If you are working outside and you\u2019re using industrial shrink wrap, don\u2019t do this on a windy day. It will be too difficult to heat the wrap without risking a fire."

To wrap them individually, stand your first piece of furniture up so that it is oriented the way it normally is when you\u2019re using it. If you\u2019re wrapping your furniture because you\u2019re moving, this is the ideal way to wrap it. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you wrap your furniture individually or as a stacked bundle if you\u2019re protecting it from the weather, but it\u2019ll be more work to wrap each furniture item separately."

If you\u2019re wrapping a table and chairs, put a blanket on top of the table and stack the chairs upside down on top of it. If you\u2019re only wrapping chairs, stack them on top of one another. Feel free to bundle your furniture however you\u2019d like to stack it or minimize the amount of space it\u2019s taking up. If you have a patio umbrella, leave it in your table and lower the pole as far as it will go. Then, wrap a few bungee cords or rubber bands around the umbrella to keep it from opening while you work. If you have smaller items you want to protect over the course of the winter, leave them underneath the table or chairs that you\u2019re stacking."

Connect armchairs by tying the armrests of different seats together and tie furniture legs to other furniture legs. Tie your furniture together as needed to ensure that it doesn\u2019t slide around while you\u2019re wrapping it or fall over during turbulent weather.Tip: There\u2019s no single correct way to secure your furniture items.

If you\u2019re purchasing a single sheet, measure every side of your bundle or biggest individual item and add them together to find the length and width of your sheet. Industrial shrink wrap comes in folded rolls, and can measure up to 100 feet (30 m) wide, so it\u2019s incredibly important that you purchase wrap that isn\u2019t too big for your purposes. These rolls need to be cut into separate sheets for each item or bundle. If you\u2019re wrapping your pieces individually, stack each piece alongside one another in a single-file line and measure the length, width, and height of the line.

Unfold the plastic if necessary by pulling the edges out from underneath the roll if that\u2019s how it came.

For example, a table with 4 corners will require 4 cuts at each corner where the plastic groups up as it hangs. The goal is to place as few relief cuts as required.

Continue this process until you\u2019ve heated the wrap at the bottom over the tape or cord on each side.Warning: Keep a fire extinguisher nearby while you do this. Shrink wrap tightens and adheres to whatever surface it is sticking against and shrinks as it\u2019s heated. However, the shrink wrap can catch fire if you hold the heat source against the surface for too long. If you smell smoke or fire, stop heating the film and inspect the wrap for a fire to make sure you\u2019re safe.

As you heat the wrap, you can see it move away from the heat source and stick to the surface. Run the gun over every section 2-3 times and work your way to the bottom to finish wrapping your furniture.

With your base and cuts secured, you can move on to the larger sections of the shrink wrap. Start on the top of the furniture and work your way down. Hold the heat gun 6\u201310 inches (15\u201325 cm) away from the surface and move it back and forth in 3\u20134 ft (0.91\u20131.22 m) sections. As you heat the wrap, you can see it move away from the heat source and stick to the surface. Run the gun over every section 2-3 times and work your way to the bottom to finish wrapping your furniture. You don\u2019t need the shrink wrap to burn or melt to get it to shrink and stick to your furniture. A light layer of heat is usually enough to secure the film to your surface. Install a vent to prevent condensation from building up if necessary. If there isn\u2019t any air flow at the bottom of your furniture, install a vent. Buy a plastic vent cover from a shrink wrap company. Peel off the adhesive backing or follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to stick it to the side of your shrink wrap. Then, cut a small 1\u20133 in (2.5\u20137.6 cm) hole in the shrink wrap inside the area covered by the vent to finish securing your outdoor furniture for the season. The vent will keep condensation from building up in your furniture over time. It is not necessary if there is plenty of air flow in the furniture, though. Repeat this process if you\u2019re shrink wrapping each item individually. If you didn\u2019t bundle your items together, set your wrapped piece of furniture out where you plan to store it for the season. Then, stand your next piece of furniture up. Pull out a new roll of shrink wrap and cut it off to repeat this process. Continue shrink wrapping your furniture until you finish all of your outdoor furniture.",

    "Add these 3 measurements together to determine the width of the industrial shrink wrap you need to wrap your items.",
    "If you\u2019re purchasing a single sheet, measure every side of your bundle or biggest individual item and add them together to find the length and width of your sheet.",
    "Industrial shrink wrap comes in folded rolls, and can measure up to 100 feet (30 m) wide, so it\u2019s incredibly important that you purchase wrap that isn\u2019t too big for your purposes.",
    "These rolls need to be cut into separate sheets for each item or bundle.",
    "If you\u2019re wrapping your pieces individually, stack each piece alongside one another in a single-file line and measure the length, width, and height of the line.",
    "Double the sum of these measurements to find how much shrink wrap you need.",
    "Order a roll of industrial sheet wrap based on your biggest measurement.",

    "If you have a long roll of shrink wrap, set it up on the ground so that it\u2019s facing your furniture.",
    "Pull the edge out and lift the plastic over the furniture.",
    "Unfold the plastic if necessary by pulling the edges out from underneath the roll if that\u2019s how it came.",
    "If you have a long roll of shrink wrap, cut the wrap at the roll once you\u2019ve completely covered the bundle or furniture item with the shrink wrap.",
    "Use your utility knife to cut parallel to the roll to remove your portion of the roll.",
    "Adjust the fabric so that it hangs equally over every side of your furniture.",
    "Place relief cuts in the wrap as needed so the wrap hangs at the sides.",
    "Use a utility knife to cut the shrink wrap at any point where the plastic clumps up as it hangs.",
    "Cut vertically through the plastic at the point where it hangs and run your cut all the way to the ground.",
    "Repeat this process for every location where the shrink wrap doesn\u2019t hang cleanly.",
    "For example, a table with 4 corners will require 4 cuts at each corner where the plastic groups up as it hangs.",
    "The goal is to place as few relief cuts as required.",
    "Each cut will require heat to seal it, so only place relief cuts where you think they will help the shrink wrap tighten against the furniture.",
    "Trim any excess material with your knife.",
    "If there is excess plastic hanging on the ground or there are any corners of shrink wrap that you don\u2019t need, cut them off using your utility knife.",
    "To cut the shrink wrap, stick your blade into the material and drag it through the material.",
    "You only need enough plastic to wrap tightly around the furniture, so trim any portions off that you know you won\u2019t need.",
    "Pull and tape the areas that you cut to hold the wrap in place.",
    "To keep the shrink wrap still while you\u2019re heating and securing it, use basic tape to secure any cut portions together to keep them from blowing around in the wind.",
    "For every location where you placed a relief cut, grab the shrink wrap and pull it taut.",
    "Then, place a small piece of tape over the tear to hold the fabric tight.",
    "You will remove these pieces of tape later, so don\u2019t press them into the wrap so hard that you won\u2019t be able to remove them.",
    "Feel free to use regular clear tape.",
    "You can also use painter\u2019s tape, masking tape, or any other tape that won\u2019t leave a residue.",
    "Duct tape won\u2019t work for this, though.",
    "Secure the fabric at the bottom with a strap or heavy-duty tape.",
    "To keep the shrink wrap secured at the bottom, use a shrink-safe woven cord or flame-resistant tape.",
    "To use the woven cord, wrap it around the base of your furniture and pull it taut.",
    "Use the woven cord\u2019s buckle to hold the cord in place once you pulled it tight to the furniture.",
    "Wrap the tape around the base while pulling the tape tight to the furniture.",
    "Many DIY industrial shrink wrap kits come with the woven strap and buckle needed to complete this step.",
    "You can also purchase these items separately from a shrink wrap company.",
    "Flame-resistant tape typically looks like aluminum foil.",
    "It\u2019s often used for ducts and gas lines that get extremely hot.",
    "Fold the material up around the strap and heat it with your heat gun.",
    "Put on a pair of heat-resistant gloves to protect your hands while you work.",
    "Plug in a heat gun or shrink wrap gun and turn it to the lowest setting.",
    "At the bottom of the furniture, fold the shrink wrap up over the tape or cord.",
    "Hold the heat gun 6\u201310 inches (15\u201325 cm) away from the surface and move it back and forth in 2\u20133 ft (0.61\u20130.91 m) lengths to shrink the shrink wrap over the tape.",
    "Continue this process until you\u2019ve heated the wrap at the bottom over the tape or cord on each side.Warning: Keep a fire extinguisher nearby while you do this.",
    "Shrink wrap tightens and adheres to whatever surface it is sticking against and shrinks as it\u2019s heated.",
    "However, the shrink wrap can catch fire if you hold the heat source against the surface for too long.",
    "If you smell smoke or fire, stop heating the film and inspect the wrap for a fire to make sure you\u2019re safe.",
    "There are special heat guns designed for shrink wrap specifically, but they cost $400-1,000.",
    "You can use a standard heat gun if you prefer.",
    "Remove the tape and heat the cut edges together.",
    "Since you\u2019ve heated the base of the furniture, you no longer need the tape to hold the shrink wrap in place.",
    "For each cut in the shrink wrap, remove your tape and fold the cut edge over itself.",
    "Use the heat gun to heat the seam where the 2 pieces meet and rejoin the shrink wrap together.",
    "Don\u2019t hold the cut edges next to one another; overlap them and then heat them so there isn\u2019t any space between each cut.",
    "Depending on the shape of your cut, this can be kind of awkward.",
    "Keep your hands away from the mouth of the heat gun while you work and do your best to get the shrink wrap as tight as possible.",
