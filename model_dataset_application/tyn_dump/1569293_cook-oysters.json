If you'd prefer to season them after cooking, or perhaps not at all, you're better off leaving them in their shells while they cook. How do you shuck oysters? Wrap the top of the oyster in a towel or put on heavy-duty gloves for protection. Slide an oyster knife into the hinge (backside) of the oyster. Twist the oyster knife by turning your wrist, like you're turning on the ignition in your car with a key. Scrape the blade across the top part of the oyster shell, twisting to open the muscle.
