Add approximately 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of lukewarm water to the container, so the kokum are completely covered with liquid. Allow them to soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Kokum, also known as kudampuli or gambooge, are the outer skins of fruit from the kokum tree that have been dried in the sun and used to provide a tart flavor to the curry. You can usually find them at Indian grocery stores."

Set the burner to medium high, and heat the pan until the oil is hot, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Kerala fish curry is traditionally made in an earthen clay pot known as a meen chatti. If you have one, you can use it. Otherwise, a standard skillet or pan can work well."

Heat them over medium high heat until they start to sizzle and pop, which should take approximately 3 minutes. You can also tell that the spices are ready when the seeds start to take on a darker color."

Allow the mixture to saute for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly fried.

Mix until well combined, and let the mixture cook until the spices turn golden brown, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. You can adjust the amount of chili powder based on how spicy you want the curry to be. If you use 2 or more tablespoons (16 g), it will be very spicy. Stick to just a 1 tablespoon (8 g) if you want the flavor to be more mild. Using Kashmiri chili powder instead of regular chili powder can also help make the spice in the curry more mild. It has a vibrant red color as well, so your finished curry will have a more vivid color."
