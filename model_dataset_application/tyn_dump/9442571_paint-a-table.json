Don\u2019t worry about removing all of the varnish, but sand down enough that the table isn\u2019t too glossy and the primer will stick.

Apply 1 coat of primer with a mini foam roller or medium to small brush. Let that layer dry before applying a second coat and letting it dry as well. Primer helps the paint stick to the wood and covers up any stains and discoloration. Make sure to roll or brush the primer in the direction of the wood grain. In between coats, wrap your roller or brush in a plastic bag and place it in the fridge. This will keep the paint moist and save you cleaning time in between layers."

The foam roller will create a smooth, even finish without any brushstrokes. Be careful to avoid drips around the table\u2019s edges and try to make the transition between brush and roller as level and smooth as possible.
