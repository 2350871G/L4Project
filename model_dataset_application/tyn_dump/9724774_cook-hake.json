Hake is a delicate fish that doesn\u2019t take long to cook through, so it\u2019s best to use a moderate temperature to prevent it from getting too done.

Add your choice of aromatics, such as lemon slices, whole peppercorns, bay leaves, and allspice. For a tangier poaching liquid, you can also use white wine in place of the broth or stock. Traditionally, a mixture of diced onion, carrots, and celery known as \u201cmirepoix\u201d is also incorporated into the poaching liquid. These ingredients can be useful for infusing your hake with a subtle savory flavor."

          "description":"Place the saucepan on the cooktop over medium-high heat until it just begins to bubble. Allow the mixture to simmer for 2-3 minutes. This will give the various flavors a chance to mingle. For best results, your poaching liquid should reach a temperature between 160\u2013180 \u00b0F (71\u201382 \u00b0C) before you add the hake.

When the meat turns opaque and takes on a plump, juicy appearance, they\u2019re ready to come out. Avoid stirring the fillets as they\u2019re poaching.

Place the fillets on a layer of folded paper towels to soak up any remaining moisture, then transfer them to individual plates for serving. Poached hake goes particularly well with bright, mild vegetables like tomatoes, mushrooms, and zucchini. Some buttery dinner rolls or a loaf of crusty, fresh-baked bread can help balance out the moistness of the fish nicely. Poach fish is best enjoyed fresh. However, any uneaten portions should keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator when stored along with the remaining poaching liquid."
