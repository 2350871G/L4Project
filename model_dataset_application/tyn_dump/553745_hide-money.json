If you're traveling somewhere unfamiliar, this is a good idea to make sure you keep your cash safe. Women can safely cup a few bills inside bras, while men will usually need to hide bills in their undershorts. The waist-band is a good bet, but it can become unloosed quite easily. If you can, sew a pocket into a pair of undershorts to keep your money secure, or use a paperclip to clip it to the hem. Head to the bathroom before you get your cash out obviously. Don't just start digging in your nether regions."

This way, if you attract the attention of a thief or pick-pocket, they're likely to come up empty-handed. Instead of putting credit cards inside, put old grocery store membership cards, or expired cards or some kind. Instead of cash, put monopoly money, or just a dollar or two. Keep it visible in your purse, and easily accessible if you're a woman, or put it in your back pocket if you're a guy."

If you're traveling, this is an excellent way to keep yourself from being robbed. Likewise, wallet chains are a common accessory in many areas, letting you turn any pair of pants into a secure pair. Pants with buttons on the pockets are somewhat effective, but less so than pants specifically outfitted with clips for the money. Use some combination of methods for the best protection."

It's uncommon for thieves to mess around with literature. Pick a specific page to put cash in with your books. If you've got a lot of money to hide, you might try doing it at your favorite page in a bunch of books. Pick page 88 for Reggie Wayne's number, or whoever your favorite player is, and you'll always remember. It can be easy to lose cash, so this is a good way to help yourself remember. If you've got too much cash, use an X-Acto knife to cut out a cash-sized divot in the pages of a big book. Get a significant one, like Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, and cut out a rectangle from the middle of the pages, so a stack of cash will nestle easily into the interior. Video game cases, DVD cases, and other types of cases can be a great alternative to books, if you don't have many laying around. Fill your old VHS sleeve of \"Money Train\" with actual cash."

Talk to your financial advisor about setting up an appropriate trust. Once you set up an irrevocable trust, the terms are unmodifiable, meaning that you can't go back on it.

    "Gold, metal, and platinum are sometimes thought to be a more secure long-term investment than keeping your money in the bank.",
    "Though they are somewhat variable in terms of their cash-value, it's usually thought that in the event of a total bank collapse, the gold-standard will be the safe way to go in the future.",
    "It's pretty difficult to cash in your gold in the meantime.",
    "Investing in precious metals might make your money secure, but it might be so secure that you can't actually use it.",
    "Buy prepaid gift cards.",
    "If you've got a lot of cash but don't want to declare it for tax purposes, it's ok to buy prepaid gift cards and instead use those to make purchases.",
    "Gift cards are widely available for lots of purposes, and you can use them to buy gas, groceries, and more store-specific items.",
    "This tactic is common among drug traffickers, some even going so far as to explore off-shore debit options that go much higher than the usual $250 limit for gift cards.",
    "Buying traditional pre-pay debit cards will typically require you to provide other information, including a social security number.",
    "If you have to provide any of this information, it won't be an effective technique."
