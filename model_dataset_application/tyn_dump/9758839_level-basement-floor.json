  "text":" Leveling with a Concrete Grinder Rent a concrete grinder from your local home improvement center. Most home improvement centers have concrete grinders you can rent out for a project so you don\u2019t have to buy one outright. If you\u2019re not sure whether a store near you rents them, call ahead and ask before you go in. Clear off your basement floor. When using a concrete grinder, it's important that the floor is completely free of any obstacles or debris. Remove all of the appliances and furniture in your basement. Then, go over the floor with a vacuum to pick up any dirt or dust. Put on safety goggles and a respirator before you start. When you\u2019re grinding concrete, small particles of concrete can be thrown into the air. These particles can be dangerous if they get in your eyes or lungs.
