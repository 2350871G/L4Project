If you want to create a specific length, measure out more than you think you\u2019ll need. As a rule of thumb, an uncurled strand of ribbon should be 3 to 6 times longer than the final curled strand.

Assembling a Curled Ribbon Bundle Create a bundle of multiple strands of ribbon before curling them. If you\u2019re wrapping a gift, use multiple strands of ribbon to tie up the box. Secure the ends in a knot at the top. Leave the loose ends long so that they create a voluminous curl.

When creating a knot, you might be worried about ruining the curls. Luckily, curling ribbon is pretty resilient. Once it\u2019s been curled you\u2019ll have a hard time flattening it out!

Or, you can punch a staple through the ribbon bundle\u2019s central knot and the paper. Make sure both of the ends of the staple have gone completely through the ribbon so it doesn\u2019t come loose.
