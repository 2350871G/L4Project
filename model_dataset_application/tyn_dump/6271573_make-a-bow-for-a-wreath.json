    "A fun variation here is to use a colored or patterned ribbon to cover the floral wire for a little pop of color!",
    "Use your glue gun to secure the burlap on the backside.",
    "Flip your bow over and apply some hot glue to the burlap that's covering the floral wire.",
    "Use your scissors to trim off any burlap that is still sticking up.",
    "Let the hot glue dry before you flip it back over so it doesn't accidentally get stuck to your table.",
    "If you don't have a hot glue gun, you could use double-sided tape.",
    "Cut out triangles from the ends of the \u201ctails\u201d for an added flourish.",
    "Instead of leaving the ends of your burlap as straight edges, cut out a triangle shape from each end for a rustic and authentic feel.",
    "It's okay if the triangles don't match exactly, but try to keep them about the same general size."
