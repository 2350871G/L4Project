Store the cheese in protected cabinets or plastic boxes, adding a damp paper towel for moisture. Open the cabinets or containers every day so that fresh air can reach the cheese. When you put the damp paper towel inside the plastic box or cabinet, make sure it isn\u2019t touching the cheese. Try using plastic boxes such as plastic tupperware or cake holders. Put the cheese on mats so that they\u2019re not touching the bottom of the cabinet or plastic container."
