Some brackets might say if they're meant specifically for MDF, but it's more important to check that any brackets you use can support the weight of the board. MDF boards can be over 50 pounds (23 kg). Any product that can hold enough weight will work. Check the board's weight by weighing yourself, then weighing yourself again holding the board. Subtract the first number from the second number to get the board's weight. These sets should come with 2 brackets, 1 for the board and 1 for the wall, and any screws or other hardware you need.
