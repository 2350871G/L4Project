Guide the blade along the horizontal lines of the mortar. Continue pushing the blade back and forth until you have removed the mortar to a depth of 15 millimetres (0.59 in). Repeat the process with all of the mortar lines you need to repair. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Rent a mortar raking tool or pneumatic chisel from a tool rental company, if necessary. A small chisel and hammer can be used. The smaller the chisel, the less damage you will do to the bricks. Use water and a mask to cut down on the dust that you breathe. Try your best to avoid grinding the brick when you are removing the mortar."

Start at the top of the chimney and work your way down to the bottom. Finish by brushing or blowing over the faces of the bricks to remove any surface dust. If you brush is getting quite dusty, bang the back of the brush on the ground to shake the excess dust off. Purchase stiff and soft-bristled brushes at a hardware or homeware store."
