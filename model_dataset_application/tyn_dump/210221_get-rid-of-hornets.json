Since they remain active after sunset, European hornets are an exception to this rule. For this species, the best time to spray is just before sunrise when it's still dark. European hornets can grow over 1 in (2.5 cm) in length, and have a reddish-brown head and thorax (the middle section of the body). Other wasps and hornets don't have this reddish-brown coloring.
