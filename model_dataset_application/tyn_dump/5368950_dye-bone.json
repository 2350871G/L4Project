          "description":"Pop the caps off 15 acorns and toss the nuts into a powerful electric blender. Blend on high to pulverize the acorns into powder. You could use two large oak galls instead of acorns if desired. Instead of a blender, you could also grind the nuts into powder using a stone mortar and pestle."

        {
          "headline":"Combine the acorn powder with water.",
          "description":"Place the powdered nuts in a small to medium non-reactive bowl. Add 1 cup (250 ml) of room temperature water to the powder. Mix to combine using a plastic spoon. Note that the level of the water will need to be high enough to cover the bone you plan to dye. If you need to create more dye, you will need to add six more powdered acorns or one more powdered oak gall for each 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water."

Note that 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of powdered rust could be used instead of a steel wool pad if desired. You may want to choose a container with a lid since this solution will sit out overnight without being used. It must be prepared now, however, and not immediately before use."

          "description":"Place the bone in the bowl holding the acorn solution. Set the container aside and allow the bone to soak overnight, or 8 to 12 hours. Make sure that the bone is completely submerged in the acorn dye. A longer soak time will lead to a darker dye. If you only want a light brownish-gray color, you can cut this amount of time down by about half."

          "headline":"Remove the bone.",
          "description":"When the bone has had enough time to soak, remove it from the acorn dye. Hold the bone over the container for a minute so that any excess solution can drip off. Do not worry if the dye is not quite the right color when you remove it from the acorn dye. The chemical reaction that the dye undergoes when immersed in the iron salt solution will alter the color and set the dye. You may want to wear rubber or plastic gloves when removing the bone to prevent your fingers from getting dyed, as well."

You need to add between 1/3 and 2/3 oz (9.5 and 19 g) dye powder for every 1 lb (450 g) of bone you plan to dye. On average, 1/2 oz (14 g) should work well for small batches of bone.
