    "If you want to paint, it's much easier to do while the bed is still in pieces.",
    "Do all the painting before completing the assembly.Paint in a well-ventilated area.",
    "Open the window in the room you're working in and use a window fan to pull fumes out of the area.",
    "Set up a sheet or drop cloth so you don't make a mess with the paint.",
    "You can always stain or paint the bed later, after you've assembled the whole thing.",
    "Building the Cabinet Cut 2 pieces of plywood to 84 inches (210 cm) by 17 inches (43 cm).",
    "These boards form the vertical supports for the bed frame.",
    "Measure and cut these boards the same as you cut the boards before.",
    "Work slowly and carefully to make sure all your boards are the correct length.These measurements are designed for a homemade queen wall bed.",
    "If you\u2019re using a kit or pre-made plan, follow those measurements instead.",
    "If you have a lot of room to work, you may want to assemble the cabinet in the room you\u2019re placing the bed.",
    "This is easier than transporting the whole cabinet.",
    "Remember that this is a big job, so only work in the installation room if you have enough room.",
    "Cut 2 more pieces of plywood to 64 in (160 cm) by 17 in (43 cm).",
    "These boards form the horizontal supports of the cabinet.",
    "Use a straightedge and pencil to draw straight cutting lines onto the wood.",
    "Then saw along the lines.",
    "Attach the 4 pieces of plywood together.",
    "Once you\u2019ve cut the 4 boards to form the cabinet, join them together to complete the frame.",
    "Lay 1 of the verticals on its edge.",
    "Then overlap its edge with 1 of the horizontal pieces.",
    "Drill 2 screws through the horizontal piece to connect the pieces.",
    "Do the same with the other 2 boards to complete the rectangular cabinet.",
    "Paint or stain the wood if you want to.",
    "If you want to decorate the cabinet, then apply any stain or paint that you\u2019d like.",
    "If you already painted the bed frame, make sure you match the colors.Wear gloves and goggles while you\u2019re painting.",
    "Work in a well-ventilated area or open a window in the room you\u2019re working in.",
    "Move the cabinet into the area that you\u2019re going to install the bed in.",
    "This is much easier with 2 people.",
    "Either lift the cabinet with a partner or put a sheet down and slide it along the floor.",
    "Then stand the cabinet up along the wall that you\u2019re installing the bed in.",
    "Installing the Hardware Attach the cabinet to the wall with 2 L-brackets.",
    "Press the cabinet against the wall as close as you can.",
    "Find 2 studs in the wall near the center of the cabinet.",
    "Arrange the cabinet so the 2 studs are evenly-spaced inside the cabinet.",
    "Then take 1 L-bracket and screw 1 side into the stud and the other side into the top support of the cabinet.",
    "Do the same for the other L-bracket.L-brackets are available at hardware stores or online.",
    "Studs are usually 16 inches (41 cm) or 24 inches (61 cm) apart.",
    "If the studs in your wall are 16 inches (41 cm) apart, find the next stud instead to space out the L-brackets.",
    "Fasten the rotating brackets to the inside of the cabinet 6 inches (15 cm) from the floor.",
    "Most rotating mechanisms have 4 holes for that fasten to the cabinet.",
    "Hold the piece against the cabinet 6 inches (15 cm) from the bottom and even with the cabinet\u2019s front edge.",
    "Then drill a hole into the wood through each hole in the bracket.",
    "Insert the bolts that came with the bracket and secure them with nuts.",
    "Do the same for the other side of the cabinet.Tighten each bolt with a wrench to make sure it\u2019s secure.",
    "There are many different kinds of hardware kits for Murphy beds, so follow the specific directions on the product you use.",
    "The distance you install the rotating mechanism from the bottom also depends on the particular kit you use.",
    "Follow the provided instructions to install the pieces correctly.",
    "Screw the mattress frame to the rotating mechanism.",
    "Slide the mattress frame into the cabinet so the header lines up with the rotating brackets.",
    "Lift the frame by its header and line it up with the brackets on each side of the cabinet.",
    "Drill into the frame using the bracket holes as guidance.",
    "Then insert the bolts from your kit into each hole and secure them with nuts.For easier installation, prop up the frame with wood while you work.",
    "That way the frame will stay stable while you install the brackets.",
    "Remember that the specific instructions depend on the hardware kit you\u2019re using.",
    "Follow those directions for proper installation.",
    "Attach the stand to the mattress frame.",
    "Hardware kits also come with a stand that supports the bed when it\u2019s in the down position.",
    "Take the stand in your kit and center it on the footer of the mattress frame.",
    "Drill through the holes on the stand and install the bolts and nuts to attach the stand.Test the stand by letting the bed stay in the down position and see if it supports the weight of the mattress.",
    "For a more realistic test, try laying in the bed and make sure it holds a person\u2019s weight.",
    "Some stands loop over the mattress when they\u2019re closed and some tuck under the mattress.",
    "Refer to your instruction manual for the correct storage position.",
    "Drill 2 in (5.1 cm) bolts through the cabinet to keep the bed closed.",
    "Close the bed and have someone else hold it shut.",
    "Then drill a hole through the cabinet and mattress frame just below the footer of the bed.",
    "Insert a 2 in (5.1 cm) bolt to work as a latch and keep the bed up while it\u2019s closed.",
    "Repeat the process for the other side.Do this step before you put a mattress on the bed to prevent drilling into the mattress.",
    "Hold the bed frame while you remove the bolts so the bed doesn\u2019t suddenly drop down while you\u2019re opening it.",
    "Install a handle on the front of the bed.",
    "Finally, complete this job with a handle to pull the bed open with.",
    "Install the handle 1 foot (0.30 m) down from the top of the cabinet so you can pull the bed down.",
    "The hardware kit you use may come with a handle.",
    "Otherwise, simply drill a piece of wood to the front of the cabinet to use as a makeshift handle.If you\u2019re installing shelves on the front of the cabinet to hide the bed, these can work as handles.",
    "No need to install a separate handle in this case."
