Most of the weight will get discarded since crawfish come with their shells on. Source the crawfish from seafood and grocery stores or crawfish trucks, which sell crawfish when it's in season. If you don't have a source of crawfish in your area, purchase it online from a vendor such as Louisiana Crawfish co., which will ship the crawfish to you live. When you take home your crawfish or receive your shipment make sure you keep them cool, away from light and heat, so they're fresh when it's time to cook them. Boiled crawfish that have been frozen do not taste nearly as good as live boiled crawfish."

Clean your crawfish by taking the following steps:\nWash off the sack. If you bought a sack of crawfish, begin with washing it off so the dirt from the outside of the sack doesn't make its way inside. Empty the sack of crawfish into a large bin, such as a kiddie pool or storage bin, and fill it with clean water. Use a paddle to stir the crawfish, then let them sit in the water for 30 minutes. Discard the dead crawfish, which will float to the top after a few minutes. Strain the water and rinse the crawfish with clean water. Keep them in a shady spot until you're ready to boil them."
