          "description":"Lay out a piece of poster board on a table and use a ruler to measure along one side from the corner. Mark the length with a pencil and draw a light line with a ruler and pencil at that mark down the paper. From the same corner, measure 6 inches (15 cm) down the other side. Make a mark and draw a line with the ruler across the paper so it meets the first line you made, forming a rectangle.If you want to make sure the hat will be form-fitting, wrap a piece of string around your head and measure the length with a ruler. Then, add 2 inches (5.1 cm) for overlap. That will be the long side you measure on the poster board. Children's hat sizes range from 20 inches (51 cm) for preschool kids to 22 inches (56 cm) for teens. Don't forget to add 2 inches (5.1 cm) or so for overlap. You can also use construction paper."

          "description":"Set the excess aside. You should now have a rectangle that's 6 inches (15 cm) wide and 24 to 26 inches (61 to 66 cm) long. Wrap the long side around your head (or the person you're making it for) to see if it fits with a little overlap. If it's too long, you can trim a bit off."

          "headline":"Fold the long edge up over the ruler by 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so.",
          "description":"Lay your ruler along the long edge of the paper, lined up with the side. Flip that edge of the paper up with the ruler so that the paper is overlapping it just enough to cover the ruler. Fold along that edge and then pull the ruler out.Basically, you need to fold the edge of the paper up 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so along the long side of the paper. You can measure this out and fold it that way if you prefer."

About 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end, cut from the edge of the paper toward the fold, stopping at the fold. Move another 2 inches (5.1 cm) down and make another slit. Keep going along the this edge until you reach the end.You should end up with flaps sticking up from the fold every 2 inches (5.1 cm) or so."

The flaps you cut in the previous step should be facing the inside of the circle, making a 90-degree angle along the fold; they will overlap a bit. Overlap the strip by 2 inches (5.1 cm) or so. Apply glue to the paper that goes underneath the edge of the other side and hold the pages together for a few seconds so the glue has a chance to take hold.You can run a glue stick along the edge or use basic white school glue. A hot glue gun would also work, but always be careful when applying hot glue! It can burn your fingers."

Cut down the lines to make a square piece of foam core board.You can find foam core board at most craft stores and big box stores. Alternatively, cover a piece of cardboard with black paper. If you're having trouble cutting the foam core with scissors, use a craft knife to cut along the lines.

Hot glue will work best, but you can also use school glue. To create an overhand knot, make a loop with both strings together as one string, then pull the end through the loop on the other side."
