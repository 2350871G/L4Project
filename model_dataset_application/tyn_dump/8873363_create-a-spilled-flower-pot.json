Here are some ideas to get you started:\nFor a tapering spill, have it start the same width as the container opening, then make it get wider and wider further out. This works best for vases. For a short spill, try having something that's curved, like a puddle of spilt milk. A long spill would look great along a fence or wall. Have it run for several yards/meters before running into a rock, pond, or other fixture. Work with your landscape. If you want a wavy spill, have it wind around rocks and other pots that might be in its path. Combine straight spills with tapering spills. You can have them grow wider or narrower the further they are from the container. This will make them look more interesting."

You can have them grow wider or narrower the further they are from the container. This will make them look more interesting. Preparing the Garden Loosen the soil in your desired location based on your plan. You need to loosen the soil not just along the spill path, but also where you will be placing the container. You can easily loosen the soil by turning it with a trowel or shovel. Set the container down on its side. Position it at the start of the spill, with the opening facing the opposite end. It should be about 1/4 to 1/2 of the way deep in the soil. If you are using something like a vase, push it down until the soil is just below the rim. If you are using a vase, consider angling the opening downward or upward. This will make it look like the flowers are pouring out of it. Fill the base of the container with good-quality soil. Keep filling it until the soil is level with the soil on the outside. You won't be filling the entire container with plants, but you will be adding some in there to make it look like the flowers are splitting out of it. The soil in the container should be at least 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) deep. Fill the loosened soil in the spill path with more soil. The soil in your garden is likely not very high-quality. Your plants will be much happier if you give them nutrient-rich soil. Mix your high-quality soil into the loosened soil, and pat it down. Adding the Plants Remove the plants from their containers. Gently squeeze on the sides of the plastic pots that the flowers came in. Grab the plants by the base of the stem, and gently lift them out. Arrange the plants on the path where you want them to go. Don't dig holes into the soil just yet. Simply set the plants down according to your plan and where you think they might look best. Even if the plants are all the same type, some might still be a little shorter/taller than others. You may have to adjust your plan based on the actual flowers. Place the taller plants towards the center of the path, and the shorter ones towards the end and edges. Add long, drooping plants into the mouth of the container. This will make it look like the plants are slipping out of it. How many plants you put inside the container really depends on the size of the opening and how much of it is sticking out of the ground.
