If you\u2019re going to make more than 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9.1 kg) of pellets, plan to order scrap wood from a local lumber yard or saw mill. To order logs or wood from a scrap yard or saw mill, expect to buy at least 1 ton of product and pay for shipment to your location, which can be expensive. Remember to order your materials in advance if you won\u2019t be gathering them yourself, since the demand for sawdust and wood is very high. Many people who make smaller batches of pellets also order excess raw plant material from local farmers to use in their wood pellets. This includes items like branches or the stalks and leaves of dead plants."

Set a container at the opposite end of the chipper to catch the wood chips as they shoot out of the machine. Some wood chippers won\u2019t let you choose the size that you want the chips to be. In that case, you may have to run the wood through the chipper 2 times to make it as small as you can. If you\u2019re using pre-processed sawdust, you won\u2019t be able to make the pieces smaller, so you can skip this step."

Turn the hammer mill on and slowly pour the wood chips into the mouth of the machine. Place a container under the mill to catch the small particles as they come out of the machine. If you don\u2019t have a hammer mill, you may be able to rent one from a local saw mill or lumber yard. This step isn\u2019t necessary if you\u2019re starting with sawdust, since it\u2019s already milled and refined to small pieces."

For a larger batch, place the wood pieces in an industrial dryer or drum heater until the pieces are dried to the desired moisture level. You can test the moisture level of the wood using a moisture meter, which you can purchase at most agriculture stores or online. In most cases, you don\u2019t have to dry sawdust. However, if your sawdust has been stored in a moist environment or feels wet to the touch, spread it out on a flat surface in a dry room for 24 hours to dry the dust."

This will help the pieces bind together as they\u2019re mixed without adding harmful chemicals to the pellets. There won\u2019t be a major difference in the texture of the wood material, since the vegetable oil is absorbed quickly.

You can find stand mixers at most housewares stores. Pour the wood into the bowl, adding vegetable oil if you\u2019re using it, and attach a curved arm for mixing the material.
