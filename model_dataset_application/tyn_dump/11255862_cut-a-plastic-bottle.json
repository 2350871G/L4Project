Even if you're familiar with the project, guides are always useful throughout the cutting process. Wrap a non-mechanical measuring tape around the bottle if you need to cut it in half. Some projects might require more marking than others. For instance, a bird feeder might require one long cut around the center of the bottle, while a cell phone holder might require a more specific, rounded cut."

Depending on how complex your project is, you might have a lot of rectangular corners to remove from the bottle. Instead of turning the bottle while the bandsaw is still cutting, turn off the machine and readjust your bottle. Above all, do your best to always operate the bandsaw using straight lines."
