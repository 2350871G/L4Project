Soak the rice for 20 to 30 minutes, then pour the rice through a fine sieve to drain the water. Soaking is optional, but it will reduce your cooking time by about 20 percent.

    "This technique is useful if you\u2019re adding brown rice to soups or if you\u2019re substituting it for white rice.",
    "For instance, if you want to make risotto with brown rice instead of Arborio rice, you\u2019ll need to parboil it first.",
    "Remove the rice from heat and drain it.",
    "When the rice is al dente, remove it from heat.",
    "It probably didn't absorb all of the water, so pour it into a fine sieve to drain the excess water.",
    "Keep the rice in the sieve after draining it instead of transferring it back to the pot.",
    "Shock the rice with cold water to stop the cooking process.",
    "After draining excess cooking water, dip the sieve (with the rice) into a bowl of ice water.",
    "Shocking the rice will help prevent it from turning mushy when you finish cooking it in your soup or stew.",
    "Incorporate the rice into your recipe.",
    "Add the rice to your dish according to your recipe or about 15 minutes before the dish is finished cooking.",
    "For example, if your soup needs to simmer for 25 minutes, let it cook on its own for 10 minutes, add the rice, then cook everything together for 15 minutes."
