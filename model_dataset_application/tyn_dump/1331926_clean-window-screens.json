          "description":"Before you can start washing the window screen, you'll need to remove it from the window. Removing the screen will allow you to completely and easily wash it. Make sure any screen you plan on washing has been removed from the window before you being cleaning it. The exact method you use to remove the screen will depend on the type of window screen you have. Many window screens will have small tabs that are pulled out, releasing the screen from the window frame. Make sure you carefully remove the screen as many window screens can be ripped or torn easily."

You'll want to make sure you've got plenty of room to work in. The area you choose should allow you to spray and drain water easily.

          "description":"A good screen cleaning will require you to have a bucket of household ammonia and water ready. Cleaning the screen with this mixture will allow you to break up and remove dirt, dust or any other substance that has come in contact with the screen. Mixing up some ammonia and water will be the last thing you need to do before you start washing the window screen. Mix one part ammonia with three parts water. If you don't have ammonia handy, you can also use warm water mixed with mild soap. Make sure you wear rubber gloves when mixing or cleaning with this mixture. Once you've mixed the ammonia and water together, stir the mixture to evenly distribute both parts. You could also use mild dish detergent if you don't have ammonia handy."
