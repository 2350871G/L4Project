Dry the head of broccoli with paper towels, then use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the florets into bite size pieces. Trim the stalks into 0.125 in (3.2 mm) thick discs, then cut the discs in half if they\u2019re bigger than bite size. Even if you don\u2019t plan to eat the stalks, cut them up so you can place them in the bottom of the bowl. This will keep the tender florets from boiling in the water in the bottom of the bowl. An average head of broccoli is roughly 1 lb (450 g) in weight."

If the broccoli is bright green in color and you can easily pierce it with a fork, it\u2019s done. Otherwise, re-cover it and cook it for another 30 seconds. It may take up to 4 minutes in total to steam the broccoli to perfection. Keep checking every 30 seconds after the first 2.5 minutes, since broccoli can go from bright green and perfectly steamed to drab green and overcooked quickly! Always be cautious when uncovering a bowl of steaming veggies. The hot steam will escape quickly, and it could burn you if you are not careful.

    "You need at least 1 in (2.5 cm) of water to build up enough steam to cook the broccoli.",
    "Bring the water to a boil over high heat.",
    "Since there\u2019s a small amount of water in the stock pot, it won\u2019t take more than a few minutes to come to a boil.",
    "Place the cut broccoli in the colander while you wait, if you haven\u2019t done so already.",
    "Put the colander of broccoli in the stock pot and add the lid.",
    "Wait until the water is at a full boil before doing this.",
    "Move on to the next step\u2014reducing the heat\u2014as soon as you put the lid on.",
    "Make sure the lid is on snugly so the steam can\u2019t escape.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium-low and check the broccoli after 5 minutes.",
    "Tender florets may be done after 5 minutes, but plan for 6-7 minutes in most cases.",
    "Put the lid back on if the broccoli isn\u2019t bright green and easy to pierce with a fork after 5 minutes, then check again 1 minute later.",
    "Repeat once more if necessary.",
    "Steamed broccoli can turn drab green, mushy, and unappetizing quickly, so check every minute after the first 5 minutes of steaming.",
    "Season your broccoli to taste and serve it right away.",
    "Remove the colander from the stock pot and pour the broccoli into a serving dish.",
    "If desired, stir in 2 Tbsp (30 g) of butter and a pinch or two of salt.",
    "Try adding lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, or toasted almond slivers to your steamed broccoli.",
    "Some people even like their steamed broccoli with mayonnaise on the side!"
