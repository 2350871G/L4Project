          "description":"Inspect the floor carefully for deep cracks, gouges, and places that have sunken due to continual wear. Fill in these areas by slathering a small amount of patching compound directly over the problem area using a hand trowel. Smooth the compound with the flat side of the trowel and use the edge to work it further into deep openings. Allow the patching compound to cure completely before proceeding. This may take 1-4 hours, depending on the exact product you use. You can find pre-mixed patching compound at any hardware store or home improvement center. Unless your floor is severely damaged, you'll most likely only need a small bucket."

          "description":"Switch on your polisher and guide it over the surface of the concrete in tight, overlapping circles. Work your way gradually from one end of the room to the other, focusing on areas that are marred by obvious imperfections, such as divots and uneven textures, as well as the places you filled in with patching compound. Polishing may not be necessary if your concrete floor is relatively new. However, it\u2019s a good idea to go ahead with the process if the concrete shows any paint splotches, oil stains, or similar residue. If you\u2019re staining a concrete floor that was previously covered with tile, you'll need to use a floor grinder equipped with diamond bits to remove stubborn scraps of dried mortar from the floor. You may need to use an extension cord to polish large rooms like foyers or galleries."

Don\u2019t forget to suction the corners and the area around the baseboards, as well. If you don't have a Shop-Vac on hand, sweep up as much dust as you can with a heavy push broom and dustpan, then go over the area again using a standard household vacuum with a floor attachment."

Mop the floor from corner to corner, or scrub it using a stiff-bristled broom or thick handcloth. After cleaning the floor, go over it with a squeegee to remove as much standing water as possible. If your floor is especially grimy or oily, you may need to apply a small amount of trisodium phosphate (TSP) or a similar degreaser to lift away heavy residue."

If you want to etch your floor, pick up a bottle of etching acid and follow the specific instructions laid out on the label. Most types of chemical etching agents need to be mixed with warm water and scrubbed onto the floor using a rigid brush. Not all concrete stains require the surface to be etched\u2014in fact, some products advise against it. Be sure to read the recommended uses of the stain you\u2019re working with before you attempt to etch your floor.

Different types of stains can have drastically different drying times. As always, be sure to consult your product\u2019s instructions to find out exactly how long to let it set.

    "Allow the stain to dry for 3-4 hours.",
    "Give the initial coat time to dry to the touch before you move on to testing the color or applying follow-up coats.",
    "The best way to make sure you stain has had enough time to dry is to let it sit overnight, though most products will begin setting within 1-2 hours.",
    "Different types of stains can have drastically different drying times.",
    "As always, be sure to consult your product\u2019s instructions to find out exactly how long to let it set.",
    "Be aware that the color of the newly-stained surface may change slightly as the stain dries.",
    "Wet a small section of the stain to test the color if desired.",
    "Pour a little water over the dried stain on an out-of-the-way part of the floor.",
    "Doing so will give you an idea of how the stain should look after you\u2019ve applied the clear sealer.",
    "If it\u2019s too light for your liking, plan on adding a second or even third coat.",
    "Be sure to soak up the water quickly after checking the color to prevent the stain from blotching or running.",
    "Apply additional coats as needed.",
    "Mix and apply the stain in the same manner as before.",
    "A subsequent coat may be necessary If the initial coat came out too light, or if there are visible seam lines or bristle marks in the finish.",
    "Remember to spray, roll, or brush the stain on in an alternating pattern to minimize the appearance of stroke lines.",
    "Allow each coat to dry for 3-4 hours before determining whether additional coats are still needed.",
    "Sealing the Stain Let the stain dry for 12-24 hours.",
    "After applying your final coat of stain, allow up to 24 hours for it to dry and set completely.",
    "If it\u2019s not properly cured by the time you add the sealant, it may smudge, streak, or end up thinner in some areas than others.",
    "The longer you let your stain dry, the better.",
    "Even if it\u2019s dry to the touch, the reaction caused by introducing the sealant may weaken its hold on the concrete.",
    "Scrub the floor with a mild all-purpose cleaner to ensure that it\u2019s clean.",
    "Combine equal parts cleanser and water in a separate bucket.",
    "Dip a clean, lint-free cloth into the cleaning solution and swab every inch of the stained concrete.",
    "Allow the floor to dry completely.",
    "Review the instructions that came with your stain.",
    "Some stains recommend adding baking soda to the cleaning solution to neutralize unwanted chemical reactions.",
    "If you don\u2019t clean your newly-stained floor before sealing it, dust particles could become permanently trapped in the sealant layer.",
    "Roll the sealant onto the stained floor using a low-nap roller.",
    "To simplify the cleanup process, pour your sealant into a paint tray before you get started.",
    "Apply a small amount of sealant to the roller, then glide the roller back and forth over the concrete to spread the sealant into a thin layer.",
    "Work in 4\u20135 ft (1.2\u20131.5 m) sections from the back wall to the doorway until you\u2019ve completed the entire floor.",
    "For best results, use the type of sealant recommended by the manufacturer of your particular stain.",
    "Interior concrete floors are typically sealed with wax.",
    "For high-traffic areas, however, urethane-coated epoxy sealants will ensure a resilient, long-lasting finish.",
    "Allow the sealant to cure for 1-2 days before using the floor again.",
    "The sealant must have ample time to harden before you take your first steps on the floor or begin replacing furniture.",
    "To get a more accurate sense of how long this will take, refer to the instructions listed on the label of the sealant you\u2019re working with.",
    "In the meantime, avoid touching the floor for any reason.",
    "You shouldn\u2019t need more than a single even coat of sealant, but if you do decide to use multiple coats, be sure to wait 45 minutes to an hour between applications.",
    "Don\u2019t forget to remove your painter\u2019s tape after the sealant has properly cured."
