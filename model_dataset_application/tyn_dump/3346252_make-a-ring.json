If in doubt, make the piece of wire longer as opposed to shorter\u2014you can always trim off the ends if necessary. The thickness and exact color of the wire is entirely up to you, but thinner wire is best as it allows you to easily manipulate it. Look for artistic wire at a craft or hardware store that comes in a small spool, as these are most often used for making jewelry. Flatten out the wire after it\u2019s cut. Straightening it out will make the wire easier to work with."

As you hold the wire firmly in one hand, use the pliers to bend down on the wire. Continue by then bending the next section of wire upwards, switching back and forth between downwards and upwards motions to create a wave along the wire. If desired, you can make small indentations along the wire before creating a ripple effect as well."

Once you\u2019ve added the beads to the wire, create bends in the wire on both sides of the beads so that the beads stay in place. For example, you might pick out one larger bead to be set in the middle of two smaller, identical beads. Pick out super tiny beads that can be strung along the entire wire if you want your ring to be completely beaded."

This will resemble your finger, letting you bend the ring into shape. If you don\u2019t have a nail polish bottle to use, look for a different perfectly round, ring-sized object to wrap the wire around. Using hard objects, as opposed to just your finger, is better for creating the ring shape as it ensures your ring is perfectly round."

    "Grind out the middle of the coin using a sanding wheel.",
    "If you have a sanding wheel that attaches to your drill, this is great for sanding out the rest of the coin to create a smooth ring.",
    "Hold the coin steady using your fingers or some other sort of clamp as you sand the inside of the ring until it thins out.",
    "A dremel tool with an attachable sanding wheel is also a good option.",
    "Continue sanding until the coin is the thickness you want your ring to be.",
    "Polish the ring using a polishing wheel or cloth.",
    "Attach a polishing wheel to your drill or dremel, using a small amount of polishing compound to get the best shine.",
    "Run the polishing wheel along the inside and outside of the ring, smoothing out all of the edges so the ring is shiny and completed.",
    "To use polishing compound, dip a rag or polishing wheel into the container of polish, using a small amount to rub over the ring's surface.",
    "Creating a Ring from Paper Cut a piece of paper to be 5 by 10 centimetres (2.0 by 3.9 in).",
    "This is a great ring size to work with, though the paper can be bigger if desired.",
    "Make sure the proportions stay the same\u2014the paper should be twice as long as it is wide.",
    "Use a thick, colorful piece of paper for a sturdy, bright ring.",
    "Fold the piece of paper in half horizontally.",
    "Lay the piece of paper on a flat surface with the longest sides positioned horizontally.",
    "Bring the top of the piece of paper down to form a crease in the middle.",
    "Unfold the piece of paper once this is done.",
    "You're creating a hot-dog style fold in the piece of paper.",
    "Bring each long edge to the center fold, forming creases.",
    "With the paper unfolded and positioned horizontally again, bring the bottom long edge up to the middle fold.",
    "Flatten this section to form a crease, and then pull down the top long edge to the middle fold and form a crease here.",
    "All of the folds made so far should be parallel to one another.",
    "Pick up the paper and turn it over before folding it in half.",
    "Without unfolding any creases, pick up the paper and turn it over so that the side facing you is smooth.",
    "Position the paper vertically and pull down the top of the paper until it reaches the bottom of the paper, forming a middle fold.",
    "Press down firmly on all of your creases.",
    "Fold down the corners of the new folded edge.",
    "Bring each corner to the middle, creating two folded triangles that touch each other.",
    "Press down on the creases so that they're nice and flat.",
    "Only do this to the folded edge, not the opposite end where there isn't a fold.",
    "Open the folded triangles and tuck them inside the paper.",
    "After you've formed good creases, unfold the two small triangles.",
    "Unfold the vertical fold so that the piece of paper is long and skinny, and fold in both triangles that have creases in the middle of the paper so that they disappear.",
    "After this step is done, your piece of paper will be folded in half vertically again, resembling a short pencil with a pointed tip and a flat bottom edge.",
    "Lay the pencil-shaped paper horizontally on a flat surface.",
    "The tip of the 'pencil' should be pointing left.",
    "Pull up the bottom long edge of the paper to the center, forming a crease.",
    "Do the same thing with the top long edge, folding it over so it's touching the middle.",
    "Only fold the top layer of paper, not the bottom layer at this point.",
    "Flip the piece of paper over and fold in the other two long edges.",
    "Turn the paper over with the point still facing the left.",
    "Pull up the bottom long edge of the paper to the middle, creating a strong crease.",
    "Pull down the top long edge to the middle of the paper as well.",
    "Open the paper gently so the paper diamond is in the center.",
    "Only unfold the long vertical fold so that your paper 'diamond' is in the middle of a long, skinny paper band.",
    "To make your diamond look more square, stick the flat end of a pencil inside the diamond to flatten out its top.",
    "Fit the ring to your finger by connecting both ends.",
    "Position the ring on your finger with the diamond facing upwards.",
    "To ensure it fits well, slide the edge of one end of the paper into the other end of the paper, tightening it as necessary.",
    "Curling the ends of the paper around a pencil can help maintain its ring shape."
