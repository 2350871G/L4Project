Avoid cheap brushes with stiff bristles if you can, as these are more likely to create brushstrokes.

If you are applying one thick layer of paint, then wait at least 24 hours before applying a another coat.

Look for a polycrylic or polyurethane sealer in either brush on or spray on form. You can also consider using a wax sealer, but keep in mind that the finish will not be as durable. If you are using chalkboard paint, do not use a sealer, as it will ruin the surface and prevent it from functioning. After you have applied the sealer, sure that you give the sealer enough time to cure before you use the furniture. This can take anywhere between 24 hours to 1 week."
