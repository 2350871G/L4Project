You can also shape the dough into two 12-inch by 2-inch (30-cm by 5-cm) rectangles if you prefer. Place the logs on the cookie sheet and shape them. When you\u2019ve formed the dough into logs, carefully transfer them to the lined baking sheets. Use your hands to gently square off the ends of the logs. Bake the logs until they are firm. Place the baking sheets with the logs in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the edges are firm. To ensure that the logs bake evenly, rotate the cookie sheets halfway through the baking process. Glazing and Cutting the Cookies Melt the remaining butter and cook it until it browns. While the dough is baking, place 1 tablespoon (14 g) of unsalted butter in a small saucepan and melt it over medium heat. Allow the butter to cook until it starts to foam and then browns, which should take approximately 4 minutes. Swirl the butter in the pan as it\u2019s heating to ensure that it cooks evenly. Add the powdered sugar and some water. Once the butter has browned, add \u00bc cup (31 g) of powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water to the pan. Whisk the mixture until it has a smooth, glaze-like consistency. Brush the glaze over the logs and allow them to cool completely. When the logs come out of the oven, use a pastry brush to apply it all over them. Once the glaze is applied, let the logs cool for at least 20 minutes. Applying the glaze while the logs are still warm allows them to absorb the glaze more easily. Cut the logs into bars. When the logs are fully cooled, use a sharp knife to cut them into slices on an angle. The slices should be approximately 1- to 2-inches (2.5- to 5-cm) large. Store the sliced cookies in an airtight container at room temperature. They should stay fresh for up to 5 days.",
