          "description":"Rinse off fruits with edible peels, like peaches and plums, and dry them thoroughly before wrapping and stowing them in your lunch box or bag. Roll up fruits with removable peels, like bananas and citrus fruits, without any preparation at all. The layers of fabric around the fruit create a cushioned pouch to prevent bruising and keep the fruit clean. If you don\u2019t dry off rinsed fruit before rolling it up, the extra moisture can make the fruit mushy and unpleasant. Wrap multiple pieces of fruit separately for the most protection. For example, don\u2019t roll a banana and a peach together in the same cloth napkin. If you aren't using a lunch box or bag, pack the rolled fruit in your backpack last so that it sits on top of everything else and won't get smashed."

          "description":"Rinse off grapes and berries and dry them thoroughly with a paper towel. Place the clean fruit in plastic containers to protect it in your bag or lunch box. Without a hard casing for protection, berries and grapes can get mushy and create a big, juicy mess inside your lunch box or backpack. You can chop the green stems off strawberries or leave them on. Grapes can be packed individually or in clusters. Bite-sized grapes and berries are great soft fruit options for kids' lunches because they're easy to eat."

This works best for small fruits like grapes, strawberries, and blueberries. Bigger soft fruits, like peaches and plums, won\u2019t fit nicely into compartments unless you cut them up first."

          "description":"Many fruits, like whole bananas, don\u2019t need to be kept cool. However, grapes, berries, peaches, and plums are often tastier when they're cold! Use an insulated lunch box or put an ice pack into your lunch box to keep everything chilled. For example, nestle a peach or plum wrapped in a cloth napkin inside your insulated lunch box. Keep whole grapes or berries stored in plastic containers chilled by using an insulated lunch box or bag."

Place the slices in a small plastic container with a lid to prevent spillage since oranges can be pretty juicy.

To prevent sogginess and protect cut fruit, place it in a small plastic container before packing it in an insulated lunch box. Try cutting mangoes, pineapples, kiwi, and pears into bite-sized pieces."

You can also try other fruit purees, like store-bought or homemade applesauce. Try mixing low-fat cream cheese or bite-sized pieces of soft fruits into fruit puree to change up the flavor and texture. Don\u2019t forget to pack a spoon so you can eat the puree!"

Simply toss the single serving container into your lunch and go! The containers are rigid and will protect the fruit inside. Be sure to pack a plastic spoon or fork so you can eat the fruit. For the healthiest option, choose sliced peaches, pineapples, and pears that are packed in water or their own juices with no sugar added. Avoid fruit packed in syrup."
