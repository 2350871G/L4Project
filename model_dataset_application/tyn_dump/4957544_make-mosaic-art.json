You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include. These could include buttons, bones, metals, etc. If you can, find them already precut into distinct shapes and sizes. This will keep you from having to break them with a hammer/saw later. Choose a wide variety of colors and shades. Even if your work will be mostly monochromatic, you will want varying values and ones. Choose tesserae that goes with the art you wish to create. For example, if you are doing a beach scene, it might be best to use a wide variety of shells. If you are looking to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge, you might want to look into metals."

For most bases, you can simply use water and a basic home cleaner. Scrub the dirt and grim off, and then dry the surface off. Go back over the surface a few more times in case you missed something. For metal bases, use sandpaper and a wire brush in order to remove rust. The now \"roughed up\" surface has an added benefit, it will make the tiles stick to the surface better. Score plastic and/or rubber surfaces with a utility knife in order to help the tiles stick better. Sand wood surfaces down, then apply a waterproof sealer.

Once you have a rough outline with a pencil, go back and trace over the lines with a pen or marker, depending on the type of base. If you are using a basic design, this might be the time to add in details that are not present in the original design. If the pattern is extra large, do it in sections.

Remember, before you begin to break your mosaic objects into pieces, you need to be wearing safety goggles, gloves, and an apron. Pick a safe place to cut your objects, like an empty garage, or outdoors in your backyard. If you are just looking to make randomly sized pieces, a basic hammer works best. However, there are some more specialized ways. Tile nippers and cutters are used to create straight lines and curves. They can be found at most hardware, and arts and crafts stores. These are used to cut through porcelain, ceramic, china, etc. Cut through the object you are using about halfway through. They, using your hands, break the piece off. Glass nippers and cutters work the same way, except that they are specially designed for cutting glass. When you are creating the pieces, look at your design. Try to envision what shapes you will need in order to fill the pattern. If you miss a piece, or mis-cut one, you can always come back later to cut a new one."

Once you get a basic layout of your pieces, find where the missing pieces are, or where you need a better shaped piece. Then go back and create a new one which better fits the design. Once you have your objects laid out the way you want them, you then have two options: leave them there, or take them off. If you choose to leave them there, you will apply mortar directly to the pieces. This garners a more accurate design, but takes a lot longer and can be more tricky. If you choose to take them off, place the pieces to the side in the same pattern they were placed on the base. You will be applying mortar onto the base.

Use a small knife or scalpel. When you are applying the mortar, wear gloves so that mortar does not stick to your hands. Mortar is basically a type of cement which can be difficult to get off. If you are applying the mixture to the base, only do one section at a time. Spread on a few inches, length wise, onto the base. You only need about a 1/4 inch width of mortar. If you are applying it to the pieces themselves, take your knife and apply the mixture to the back of the piece. Try to keep most of the mortar adhered to the back by gently pressing the mixture with your hands. Scrape off excess mortar from around the outside edge of the piece before you apply it."
