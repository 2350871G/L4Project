The instructions should also include guidelines for how wide the hem will need to be and how to achieve this result. If you are not using a pattern, then you might look into common hem widths for the type of project you are working on. For example, curtains usually have a 2 in (5.1 cm) wide hem, while sleeves may only have a hem that is 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide, and napkins may have hems that are small as 0.25 in (0.64 cm) wide."

If you are making a project without a pattern, then add the hem allowance before you cut the fabric. For example, if you are making napkins and you want them to have a 0.25 in (0.64 cm) double-folded hem on all 4 sides, then add 1 in (2.5 cm) to the fabric dimensions. This would mean that to make a 16 by 16 in (41 by 41 cm) napkin, you would need to cut a piece of fabric that is 17 by 17 in (43 by 43 cm)."

Even if you are following a pattern, you may find that you want the hem a little higher or lower than the pattern indicates. Mark the fabric or place pins to indicate where you think the hem should begin and end. This may require adjusting the width of the hem if you have limited fabric. For example, if a pattern calls for 3 in (7.6 cm) wide hem on the bottom of a skirt, but you would like the hem to be lower, then you might need to reduce the width of the hem by 1 in (2.5 cm) and have a 2 in (5.1 cm) hem instead."

  "text":" Determining How Wide the Hem Should Be Check your pattern for any special instructions. If you are following a sewing pattern, then it should include detailed instructions about how to hem your finished item. The instructions should also include guidelines for how wide the hem will need to be and how to achieve this result. If you are not using a pattern, then you might look into common hem widths for the type of project you are working on. For example, curtains usually have a 2 in (5.1 cm) wide hem, while sleeves may only have a hem that is 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide, and napkins may have hems that are small as 0.25 in (0.64 cm) wide. Find out how much fabric you will need before you cut and sew. If you are using a pattern, then the amount of fabric you need to create the hem should already be included. If you are making a project without a pattern, then add the hem allowance before you cut the fabric. For example, if you are making napkins and you want them to have a 0.25 in (0.64 cm) double-folded hem on all 4 sides, then add 1 in (2.5 cm) to the fabric dimensions. This would mean that to make a 16 by 16 in (41 by 41 cm) napkin, you would need to cut a piece of fabric that is 17 by 17 in (43 by 43 cm). Try on garments before creating the hem. If you want a perfect fit on garments you are sewing for yourself or for a friend, try the garment on and check the positioning of the hem before you sew it. Even if you are following a pattern, you may find that you want the hem a little higher or lower than the pattern indicates.

Sew the hem last unless you are pleating a garment. Hemming should always be your last step when you are sewing something. The only exception to this would be if you are making a pleated skirt. In this case, you will need to hem the bottom of the skirt before you add the pleats. For example, if you are making a pleated skirt, sew the hem before you work on the waistband of the skirt. Then, make the pleats and secure them with the skirt's waistband. Folding the Hem Make a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) fold along the raw edge of the fabric. Fold the fabric over towards the wrong (back) side, so that the raw edge of the fabric will be hidden on the back of the item when you are finished. The wrong (back) sides of the fabric should be together after this fold. You can make the first fold larger if you plan to do a wide hem, such as a 2 in (5.1 cm) hem. Make sure that the first fold is equal to or smaller than the desired hem width. If you plan to do a narrow hem, such as a 0.25 in (0.64 cm) wide hem, then your first fold should also be 0.25 in (0.64 cm). Fold the desired amount of fabric for the hem. You can make your hem as narrow or as wide as you like. This fold will hide the raw edge of the fabric. For example, you could make your hem 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide for sleeves, or 3 in (7.6 cm) wide for pantlegs. Try folding the fabric over and checking to see what hem width looks best.

You may also want to place a T-shirt or towel over the fabric to prevent it from getting damaged by the heat. Be careful not to iron over pins in the fabric. You may want to remove the pins in sections to avoid accidentally ironing over them. Sewing the Hem Select a thread type and color that will work for your project. You can use thread that matches your fabric if you want it to blend in, or go with thread that will contrast with the color of the fabric if you want it to stand out. For example, if you are sewing a hem on white fabric, then opt for white thread if you want the thread to blend in.
