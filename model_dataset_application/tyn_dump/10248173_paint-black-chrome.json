Rip 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) of tape, and place it anywhere you\u2019d like. For instance, if you are painting the rims of your car, remove the rims from the tires, stretch out a plastic drop cloth, and place the rims on top. You can also cover the back of the rims with painter's tape to keep the inside silver."

If you are painting an automobile, ensure you have auto primer, rather than an all-purpose primer. Your chrome will look matte and dark instead of silver and shiny.
