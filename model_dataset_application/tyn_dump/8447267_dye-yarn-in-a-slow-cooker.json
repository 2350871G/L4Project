The process won\u2019t work on plant-based fibers, such as cotton, bamboo, or flax, or synthetic yarns, such as acrylic or nylon. You can use yarn that\u2019s a blend of protein-based and other fibers as long as it\u2019s at least 50 % protein-based. For example, you could use yarn that\u2019s 75% wool and 25% nylon."

          "description":"To prepare the yarn for dyeing, you need to wrap the yarn in large loop that\u2019s approximately 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.2 m) (91 to 122 cm) long so it\u2019s easier to work with. Wind it around the back of a chair to create the loop, and use a piece of synthetic yarn that won\u2019t dye to loosely tie it so it\u2019s secure. If you purchase yarn in a hank, or a big circle, you don\u2019t need to tie it in a loop. A ball or skein of yarn must be tied in a loop, though. You may want to secure the loop of yarn in one more than one location to ensure that it stays wrapped up while you work with it."

Mix the solution with a wooden spoon to ensure that the water and vinegar are fully combined. The water doesn\u2019t need to be hot. It should be between 95 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 41 degrees Celsius)."

Push it down into the water and hold it under until it is saturated enough to remain under the water on its own. Allow the yarn to soak for at least 30 minutes. Soaking the yarn in the vinegar mixture helps soften the fibers so the yarn will absorb the color more easily."

For the best results, use synthetic food coloring. Vegetable-based food colorings typically don\u2019t work as well. You can also use powdered food drink mix, such as Kool Aid, to dye the yarn. Fabric dye also works well to dye yarn, but it will leave you unable to use the slow cooker to make meals again in the future. It\u2019s best to start with a small amount of coloring or dye. If you aren\u2019t happy with the color of the yarn when it\u2019s finished cooking, you can add more coloring and allow it cook longer.
