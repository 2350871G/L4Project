The oil will keep the dough from sticking to the pan and will give the bottom of the pizza added flavor. If you do not have a round pizza pan, use a rectangular baking sheet instead. Simply coat the baking sheet with the olive oil as you would the pizza pan."

Work from the center of the dough outward. Continue to work the dough until it roughly forms the shape and size of your pan. Purchase store-bought pizza dough in the frozen or refrigerated section of your local grocery store or a local pizzeria. If you are feeling extra adventurous, consider making homemade pizza dough instead of using the store-bought dough."
