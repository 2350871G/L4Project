November is the best time to look for the Pleiades, when they are visible from dusk to dawn and reach their highest point in the sky. In early October, the Pleiades become visible a couple hours after sunset. By about February, the Pleiades are already high in the sky at sunset. (The exact timing depends on your latitude.) The Pleiades are visible in late summer and early autumn as well, but only in the middle of the night."

On a winter evening at a mid-northern latitude, he stands almost due south, about halfway between the horizon and the sky directly above your head. Locate him by his belt, a straight line of three bright stars close together. The red star nearby, Betelgeuse, forms his left shoulder (from your perspective), while the blue giant Rigel on the other side of the belt is his right leg."

The next bright star you see in this direction is another bright, red-orange star: Aldebaran. This is the Arabic word for \"Follower,\" likely named because it chases the Pleiades each night. Aldebaran is not in a perfect line with the belt. Don't try to get there with binoculars, or you may miss it. Aldebaran dips below the horizon around March, or earlier in extreme northern latitudes. If Aldebaran isn't visible, try to follow Orion's belt all the way to Pleiades."

Fairly near to Aldebaran, you should see a tight cluster of blue stars. These are the Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters or M45. Most people can only see six stars with the naked eye, or even just a hazy clump if light pollution interferes. With a clear night and keen, dark-adjusted eyes, you may see more than seven. The Seven Sisters are clustered close together. From end to end the cluster is only \u2154 the width of Orion's Belt. This is much less than the length of the Big Dipper or Little Dipper, star patterns which some novice stargazers confuse with this one."

If you become familiar with this constellation, you can find it as a starting point and look for the Pleiades nearby. Taurus may be difficult to see during a bright moon, especially near an urban area."
