  "text":" Slicing Jellied Canned Cranberry Sauce Open the can from the bottom using a can opener. The majority of canned cranberry sauces are meant to be opened from the bottom of the can rather than the top. If you don\u2019t have a can opener, you can also use a kitchen knife to perforate around the edge of the can\u2019s bottom to pry it open. Run a butter knife around the walls of the can to loosen the jelly. The cranberry sauce often gets stuck to the sides of the can.
