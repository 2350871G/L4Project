The cornstarch and egg will continue to thicken the broth in this time. Serve the lomi hot and garnish it with soy sauce for added flavor. Use a ladle to transfer the lomi into a serving bowl. Make sure you have a little bit of each ingredient in the bowl. If you want, you can add a little soy sauce to enhance the flavor. Chop a hard-boiled egg to use as added garnish.",
