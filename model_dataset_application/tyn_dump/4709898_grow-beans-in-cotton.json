Purchase a packet of bean seeds if you want instructions for how to grow them in the ground after they sprout, or use any type of whole, dry beans if you just want to experiment. To keep the plant compact, opt for a bush bean plant. This will not require a trellis or pole to support it and it will only grow to about 2 ft (0.61 m). If you opt for pole beans, then the vine may grow to 15 ft (4.6 m), so it will need plenty of room to climb."
