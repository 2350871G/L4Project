In warmer climates this could be in mid-spring, and in cooler climates you might have to wait until late spring. If you plant your squash too early, it won't survive. If you want to get a head start, you can start the seeds indoors up to 3 weeks before the last frost. Plant the seeds 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep in seed starter mix in small pots.
