      "description":"Dark blues, grays, browns and greens tend to be less visible at night than actual black because of the silhouettes. Camouflage should match the local environment. The outfit must be comfortable and versatile. Waterproof, washable, durable clothing is desirable. Also, clothing should not be loud-this means no loose clothing that rubs together, things that jingle, or stiff clothing/shoes that creak. Sweats are best. Wear your outfit when playing."
