Otherwise, move the biscuits to paper towels or a cool baking tray. Wait for the biscuits to cool completely before storing them. Using a wire rack is the fastest way to cool biscuits. Expect a longer cooling time when using other methods. The baking tray you used to originally cook the biscuits will still be warm when it comes out of the oven. This can cause the biscuits to overcook, so move them to a cooling rack as soon as possible."

Unfortunately, they will dry out over time, so opt for a different storage method if you don\u2019t expect to use them right away. Room temperature storage may be suitable if you didn\u2019t make a lot of biscuits.
