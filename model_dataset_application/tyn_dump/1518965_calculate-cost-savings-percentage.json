For example, if the original, retail price of a sweater is $50, use $50 as your original price. For an hourly service, multiply the standard billing rate by the number of hours normally billed. Determine the new price of the product or service. This is the price after any sales promotions, discounts, coupons, or deals that you received on it. For example, if you ultimately paid $40 for the sweater after all discounts, the new price is $40. Determine the price difference. To do this, subtract the new price from the original price.
