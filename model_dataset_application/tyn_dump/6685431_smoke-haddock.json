      "description":"There are two different approaches to this, depending on whether you want to do a dry cure or a wet cure:\n\nDry Curing: Mix 700ml (about 3 cups) of salt and 250 (about 1 cup) of sugar. Add other flavourings, such as garlic, chives, pepper, et cetera, if desired. Rub the mixture over the entire fish thoroughly. Wrap the fish tightly in plastic wrap, put the fish on a plate, and refrigerate for 18 - 24 hours. Drain off any liquid that pools over this time. Wet curing: Mix 700ml (about 3 cups) of salt and 250 (about 1 cup) of sugar with 4.5 litres of water (about a gallon) in a large pot. Add other flavourings, such as garlic, chives, pepper, et cetera, if desired. Keep the fish in the plastic wrapping and place the fish into the pot, cover, and refrigerate for 6 - 24 hours. A longer brining time will create a stronger flavour and a longer-lasting fish."
