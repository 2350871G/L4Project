          "description":"Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful cleaning chemical, even when diluted, so only use small dabs of the solution to clean away the stain. It is slightly corrosive, so wash the surface thoroughly with tap water as soon as the stain has disappeared. If your stain is particularly hard to remove, lay a rag soaked with hydrogen peroxide over the stain. Let it set for 1-2 hours. Then, remove the rag and proceed with scrubbing the stain. Before you use this technique to clean a stain in a visible area, try it out in an inconspicuous spot to make sure it won't damage your tiles. Hydrogen peroxide is particularly effective for cleaning coffee stains, nail polish, and blood stains on ceramic or finished tile. Hydrogen peroxide is a bleach-like chemical, so before you use any other cleaning sprays or solutions in the kitchen, wipe down the tiles thoroughly with water to remove any remnants."

If the solution doesn't prove to be strong enough, add another cap full and try again, but be careful of how much you add as bleach is incredibly bad to get on anything except stains. Bleach is especially effective with ink, coffee, juice, and blood stains \u2014 basically anything that has a hard time being cleaned normally will be wiped away by bleach. Bleach is infamous for reacting with other cleaning solutions, especially ammonia-based solutions.

Scouring powder is effective at cleaning common floor stains such as grease stains, food stains, and water marks.

Scrub the stained area of tile until it is lifted \u2014 this may require some elbow grease for particularly tough stains. Only use Borax on finished tiles, such as ceramic, porcelain, or marble.

Marble tiles have a different structure and makeup to other tiles, and although bleach and hydrogen peroxide generally work, marble poultice is specially made to clean this material.

Baking soda and water is preferable for slate as it won't leave any permanent marks that could be easily washed away on ceramic or other glazed tiles. Baking soda is good to use for small, sticky stains, but with some elbow grease can also be effective for larger stains.

Don't mix the vinegar with baking soda or any other cleaners or it could cancel out the cleaning properties of both ingredients. If the area is still dirty, wipe the vinegar away with water before trying another cleaning method. White vinegar is great for grout, but is also effective for cleaning household ceramics such as bathtubs, toilets, and sinks. It's especially useful for removing hard water stains. Be sure to use full-strength vinegar to maximize its cleaning effectiveness. Look for full-strength vinegar in the cleaning section, as cooking vinegar isn't as strong. Opt for a mix of baking soda and water to clean non-ceramic tiles. Ceramic, marble, and other tiles with a finish coating are easily cleaned using the other methods in this guide, but slate and otherwise unglazed tiles must be cleaned with a mix of baking soda and water. Mix 3 parts baking soda with 1 part water in a bowl, stir it into a paste, then scrub the paste onto the stain with a toothbrush.

After you clean with baking soda, it's normal to have a white glaze left on the surface you cleaned. To prevent this, rinse the area well and wipe it down 2-3 times with a clean rag. Spray lemon juice on hard water stains on finished tiles. Lemon juice is very acidic and will lift hard water stains easily from finished tiles.

Only use lemon juice on finished tiles, like ceramic and porcelain, and never on stone or slate tiles, as the acidity could cause unremovable stains in the material. Using Ice to Remove Sticky Stains Fill a plastic bag with ice cubes and lay it over the wax, gum, or tar stain.
