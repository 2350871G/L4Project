If you want the cheese to be flavored, add some chopped herbs, or some spices, or chopped fruit or vegetables at this stage, and mix in. Pick up the sides of the cloth and gather it into a bundle. Tie a knot at the top. Hang the bundle over a bowl sitting in the refrigerator (use the shelf above or a taller object to hold it in place). Keep it in this position until it stops dripping. Remove from the fridge and take out of the cloth. Place the remaining cheese on a plate. Add salt if wished and enjoy with crackers. Keep refrigerated in an airtight container."
