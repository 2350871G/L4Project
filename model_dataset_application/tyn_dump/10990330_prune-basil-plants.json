          "description":"The last thing you want to do is prune your plant too early. Your basil plant needs to be at least 6 inches (15 cm) tall before you start pruning. This will ensure that there are 5-6 sets of leaves coming from the stem of the plant. Having at least 5-6 sets of leaves is important, because you want to have 1-2 sets of leaves left when you cut it. These leaves are essential for converting sunlight into energy for your basil plant."

          "headline":"Locate the central stem.",
          "description":"A basil plant is made up of a one tall, main stem with sets of small leaves growing out of each side. The central stem will be the thickest one in the middle. Cutting the main stem will yield two new stems growing from it. Be gentle when handling your plant. Basil is very sensitive and can bruise easily."

          "description":"Once you've located the central stem, start counting the set of leaves from the top of the stem and move your way down the plant until you reach the fifth set of true leaves. Make an angled cut about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) to \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) above the spot where two leaves are growing. Make sure there are at least 1 or 2 sets of leaves left at the bottom of your stem. These leaves are necessary for the continued growth of your basil plant. Always use scissors or gardening shears to cut the stem. Never use your fingers, as this may injure the plant."

          "headline":"Cut flower blossoms as soon as they start to form.",
          "description":"If you see flowers start to bloom from your basil plant, clip them off immediately. Flower growth is a sign that your basil plant has switched from growth mode to reproductive mode. This is great if you want to plant more basil seeds, but if you want your current basil plants to get thicker and continue growing, you'll need to cut those flowers off with gardening clippers. To prevent blooming from reoccurring immediately, move down the stem a few sets of leaves before cutting."

          "headline":"Repeat pruning every 1-2 weeks.",
          "description":"Make sure you prune your basil plant throughout the summer season. This will ensure optimal growth and more basil for you to cook! Wait at least 1-2 weeks before trimming again, to avoid cutting too much of the stems."

Use a watering can or spray bottle to moisten the soil so the roots can absorb the water. Make sure the soil is moist, but not soggy.

Mix the water-soluble liquid with water according to the manufacturer's instructions, and apply it at the same time you water your plants. During the first 2 months of the growing period, fertilize every 2 weeks. Throughout the summer, it's best to fertilize once a month."

If a late cold spell occurs, move your basil plant indoors or cover it with a frost blanket or plastic covering. When you cover the plants, make sure the material isn't touching or rubbing against the leaves. Use sticks to keep the covering out of the way, or a covering made for plants that will just hover over it. Basil plants will sulk and turn yellow in temperatures under 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C)."

Depending on the type of basil, the flower buds will be green, yellow, or purple, and have tiny, triangular petals. Remove them by cutting them with scissors, or pinch them off with your fingers.

All you need to do is pack them in an airtight container or plastic bag before putting them in the freezer. When you're ready to cook, just take out the amount you need and prepare them. You can also store the basil by air-drying it. For this method, remove the leaves from the stem and place them in a shady area. After about 3-4 days your basil should be dry. Although this method works to store your basil, it may not preserve all of its flavor. You can also use a food dehydrator to dry your basil leaves."
