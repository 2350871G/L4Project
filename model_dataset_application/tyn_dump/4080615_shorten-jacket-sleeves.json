For example, if you want the sleeves to end right at your wrist, but they are too short at this length when you bend your elbows, then you might need to shorten them so that they end about 0.5 cm (0.20 in) below your wrists instead."

  "text":" Measuring the Sleeves Try on the jacket to determine the new sleeve length. To get the best possible fit, put the jacket on and identify where you would like the sleeves to fall.

Mark this spot in a few places around the sleeve using a piece of chalk. Then, connect the marks in 1 solid line. Cutting the Sleeves Use a seam ripper to pull out the stitches along the hem and seam. Rip the stitches by running the hook section of the seam ripper through the stitches on the hem and seam of the jacket. You will need to remove the stitches before you start cutting. This will detach the sleeve lining from the sleeve fabric, which is necessary for hemming the sleeve properly. Be careful not to rip the fabric as you do this! Slide the lining fabric up and out of the way. To avoid cutting through the lining fabric, move it up into the sleeve so it will be out of your way. Cutting the lining along with the jacket's exterior fabric may affect the fit of your jacket. You may want to pin the lining up inside of the sleeve to ensure that it will not get in the way when you cut the outer fabric. Cut the outer fabric along the second line you created. Cut straight along the line all the way around the sleeve using a pair of sharp scissors. Make sure to cut the outer sleeve fabric only. Repeat the same process for both sleeves. Hemming the Sleeves Pull the lining fabric back down. Pull down the lining so that it extends past the new end of the sleeve fabric. If you used pins to hold the fabric back, then take out the pins first. Cut the lining to the same length as the sleeve. The jacket lining will need to be trimmed, to match the end of the jacket sleeve fabric before you sew the new hem. Line up the 2 layers of fabric and then trace a chalk line along the edge where the end of the jacket fabric overlaps the lining fabric. Cut along this line using a pair of sharp scissors. Fold the fabric under by 5 centimetres (2.0 in) so it covers the lining. Ensure that the jacket lining and outer material are lined up. Then, fold the outer material at the end of the sleeve over the lining fabric towards the inside of the sleeve. This will hide the raw edges of the lining and outer material. Place a few pins around the folded sleeve to keep it in place. Insert the pins going perpendicular to the end of the sleeve so they will be easier to remove as you sew. Place a pin about every 5 cm (2.0 in). Secure the folded fabric with a straight stitch. Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting and sew all the way around the edges of the sleeve. Make sure to use a thread that matches the color of the jacket, such as black thread for a black jacket. Position the stitch about 3 cm (1.2 in) from the folded edge. Remove the pins before you sew over each area to avoid damaging your machine. Backstitch by 5 cm (2.0 in) when you reach the end. To secure the final stitches, press down on the lever on the side of your sewing machine and hold it while still applying gentle pressure to the pedal. This will reverse the direction of your sewing machine. Sew for 5 cm (2.0 in) and then release the lever and sew back to where you started. Trim off the excess threads and you are done with the sleeve! After you finish sewing the first sleeve, repeat the process for the second sleeve.",
