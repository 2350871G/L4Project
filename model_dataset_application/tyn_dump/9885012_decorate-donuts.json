Dip it about halfway down, keeping even around the edges as much as possible. While the donut is upside down, shake off any excess glaze. Customize your glazes. If you want to change things up, divide your glaze into any number of separate bowls. Afterwards, you can add different food colorings to each. Apply sprinkles. If you're not using mixed sprinkles, dump various colors into your ice cube tray and mix them up. This is a simple and effective way of organizing your materials.
