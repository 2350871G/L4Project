If your floor has been shellacked or lacquered, you\u2019ll have to strip and wax it yearly. You can use denatured alcohol and lacquer thinner to test your floor finish. Test a small area of the floor you normally cover with furniture or a rug. Apply 2-3 drops of the alcohol. After a few seconds, touch the spot with an old cloth. If it feels soft, it\u2019s shellac. If the alcohol doesn\u2019t soften the finish, apply 2-3 drops of lacquer thinner to a nearby spot. If it softens to the touch, the finish is lacquer.
