You\u2019ll be able to find LED bulbs in an array of convenient sizes to suit your unique lighting needs at most hardware and home improvement stores.

All you have to do is hang your bug zapper up a few feet away from your porch light and let it do its thing. Because of the constant buzz of electricity and stench of burnt insects, bug zappers may not be the go-to solution for people who use their porch as a place of peaceful refuge.

Just be sure to keep the liquid away from exposed wiring and other electric lighting components. It may be necessary to spray your herbal solution once or twice a day during the muggy summer season when insects are out in full force. You can also mix essential oils with a mild carrier oil like olive or coconut oil and apply them to your skin to serve as a wearable repellent."

When outfitting your porch, be sure to choose a type of screening that\u2019s small enough to prevent gnats and other tiny nuisances from slipping through the cracks. An experienced contractor can screen-in an exposed porch in a single afternoon for as little as a couple hundred dollars. If you\u2019re handy with a toolbelt, you might also opt to install a screen yourself using a simple DIY system like Screen Tight. The occasional fly or moth may still get in while the door is open, so it\u2019s a good idea to use your screened-in porch in conjunction with a yellow light, bug zapper, or scented candle."

Drain small ponds, gulches, and low spots in your lawn using a surface pump, or have channels cut into the ground to promote proper runoff. Chances are, you\u2019ll notice a big difference right away. If you live in an area that receives a lot of regular precipitation, consider filling in problem areas with sand, gravel, or a mixture of both. Rainwater will filter down between the sediment rather than pooling on the surface. Stagnant water is a favorite habitat of insects like mosquitoes that carry diseases."
