The combination of heat and gentle abrasion will go to work on the worst of the caked-on crud in the pan before you ever lift a finger. When cleaning particularly large pans, you can use as many as 8-10 drops, or drizzle a thin line of soap along the walls and bottom surface."

Together, the soap and water will form a sudsy solution perfect for softening up messes that are too heavy for a normal hand washing. Make sure you fill the pan all the way to the top. That way, the solution will touch each part of the pan covered with cake remnants or brown, crusty buildup from past baking projects. Be careful handling your pan after filling it with hot water.

As you do, go over any remaining residue or discoloration with a soft-bristled dish brush or the rough side of a kitchen sponge. Flexible, nylon-bristled bottle brushes can be useful for getting down into the nooks, crannies, and contours of irregularly-shaped bundt, cupcake, and novelty pans. Steel wool can also come in handy for scraping off burnt and hardened residue that puts up a fight. Only use steel wool on pans made from glass or stainless steel, however, as it can easily ruin an aluminum pan."

Continue rinsing until the water runs clear, then shake off the excess moisture and pat the pan dry inside and out with a clean, absorbent towel. Be sure to rinse away all traces of the soap solution. If you allow it to dry on the pan, it may leave behind a waxy film, which could affect the taste of future confections. If you'd prefer to let your pan air-dry, place it upside down on a drying rack or mat to prevent water from collecting at the bottom. A good soak should be enough to deal with most light messes. If the pan is still visibly dirty afterwards, you may need to try a more intensive cleaning method."
