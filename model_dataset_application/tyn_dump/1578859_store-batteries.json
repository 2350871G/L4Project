Do not put a battery in a freezer unless the manufacturer recommends it.Traditional nickel-based batteries lose their charge quickly even at low temperatures. They recharge faster at cool temperatures, but not below 50\u00baF (10\u00b0C) for consumer-grade chargers.More recent LSD (Low Self-Discharge) NiMH batteries are designed to maintain their charge at room temperature."
