The dough should be course and loose in texture, rather than moist. Add the water very slowly, in small increments, so that you don't end up mixing in too much. Puri dough should never be wet or sticky. If the dough seems very moist, work in some extra maida (or cake flour) to absorb the extra moisture."

When they are crispy and very lightly brown (after about 20-30 seconds, use a large slotted spoon to place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.

Remove them before they turn dark brown, or they'll have a burned taste and fall apart easily. Cook only a few puris at a time. If you crowd the pot, it will be difficult to control the cooking time of each puri. Don't cover the puris when they're finished cooking, or they won't stay crispy."
