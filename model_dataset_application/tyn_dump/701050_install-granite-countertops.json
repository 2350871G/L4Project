Select a style and color that matches your kitchen or bathroom. Granite comes in colors ranging from blue, black, brown, deep red, and vibrant white. Expect to pay a minimum of $75 per square foot of granite slab, to more than $250 per square foot, depending on the granite color and type. You may opt to order a granite slab with pre-finished edges, or cut and smooth the edges on your own."

For more money you can order a granite slab with pre-finished edges, and in some cases, a pre-cut hole for your sink as well.

Attach the small saw to a garden hose as indicated in the manufacturer's instruction manual. Position the saw just outside the lines you drew and gently drag the blade across the granite until you cut all the way through the slab. Cut just outside of the lines you traced to leave some room for the granite to be grinded down and smoothed on the edges. Buy or rent a handheld wet circular saw from your local hardware store. Wear gloves, goggles and a face mask to protect yourself while cutting the granite. Have someone catch the sink cutout so it doesn't fall through the counter and break."

Slowly drag the grinder back and forth along the edge on the slab until you are satisfied with its smoothness. You can use this tool to make rounded corners on your granite countertop if you wish. Run a clean wet cloth over the granite after cutting and smoothing it to remove dust, dirt, and debris from the surface."
