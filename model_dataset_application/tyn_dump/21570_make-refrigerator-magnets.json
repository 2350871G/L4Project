    "You will be able to see how much of your letter or image will show through the gem.",
    "Here are some ideas of what you can use:\nPhotos\nPages from old books\nOld maps\nScrapbook paper or wrapping paper\nNewspaper or magazine pages\nPatterned fabric\nNail polish Use the gem to trace a circle onto your backing.",
    "You can use a large hole punch to cut out a perfect circle, if you can find one that is the same size as your gem.",
    "Most glass gems, however, won't be perfectly round, so it might be better to trace them.",
    "Cut the backing out.",
    "Most glass gems are beveled on the bottom, so you might want to cut just inside the line that you drew.",
    "Spread a thin layer of glossy Mod Podge  on the back of the glass gem.",
    "Apply it using a paintbrush or a foam brush.",
    "Make sure that it is even, and that the entire back of the gem is covered.",
    "You can also use another clear-drying liquid glue.",
    "If you are using nail polish, you don't need to apply any Mod Podge.",
    "Simply brush on a few coats of nail polish onto the back of your stone.",
    "Press the backing face down into the glue.",
    "Smooth it out using your fingers, starting from the center and working outward This will get rid of any air bubbles and wrinkles.",
    "Apply another coat of Mod Podge to the back of your gem.",
    "Make sure that you go a little bit over the edges of your backing.",
    "This will seal it to your gem.",
    "If you used nail polish, consider brushing on a top coat onto the back to seal it.",
    "Allow the Mod Podge to dry completely.",
    "A good indicator is when it turns clear, but it is better to let it dry overnight.",
    "This will also allow the Mod Podge to cure and make it less tacky or sticky.",
    "Glue a round magnet to the back of your gem.",
    "You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue.",
    "Place a thin layer of glue onto the magnet, then press the magnet down into the back of the gem.",
    "Allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.",
    "Hot glue will set within a few seconds, but industrial strength glues will need a much longer drying and curing time.",
    "If you are using an industrial strength glue, refer to the label for a specific drying and curing time.",
    "Just because something looks and feels dry does not mean that it is fully cured and ready to be used.",
    "Making a Clothespin Magnet Gather your supplies: Clothespins can make great magnets because you can use them to clip and hold things such as memos and recipes.",
    "Here's a list of what you will need to make one:\nWooden clothespins\nMagnet (sheet is recommended)\nGlue\nDecorations, such as paint, washi tape, etc Buy some wooden clothespins.",
    "They must be the type that have a spring in them.",
    "The solid wood ones that don't open and close won't be suitable for this.",
    "Decorate your clothespin.",
    "This is where you can get really creative.",
    "However you decide to decorate it, make sure that you leave the back blank, or you won't be able to glue the magnet on.",
    "Also, make sure that you can still open and close the clothespin.",
    "Here are some decorating ideas:\nCover the top and sides of your clothespin with washi tape.",
    "Washi tape is a type of patterned scrapbooking tape.",
    "You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.",
    "Paint your clothespin using a small paintbrush and acrylic paint.",
    "You can paint it all one color, or many colors.",
    "Simple designs, such as stripes, will work best on the clothespin.",
    "Glue a thin, flat wooden shape, such as a cat or dog, to the top of the clothespin.",
    "The wooden shape should be about the same length as the clothespin.",
    "You can find the wooden shapes in the wood section of an arts and crafts store.",
    "Glue down some buttons down the center of your clothespin.",
    "Play around with different shapes, colors, and patterns, just make sure that the buttons are the same width as the clothespin.",
    "Allow the clothespin to dry, if necessary.",
    "Depending on how you decorated it, this can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.",
    "Some decorations, such as washi tape, don't require any drying time.",
    "Cut your magnet down to fit your clothespin.",
    "Cut a strip of magnetic sheeting down to fit the back of your clothes pin.",
    "If you are using round, button magnets, plan on using two magnets per clothespin.",
    "Glue the magnet to the back of your clothespin.",
    "You can use an industrial strength glue or hot glue.",
    "Draw a line of glue down the back of the clothespin and press the magnet down into the glue.",
    "If you are using round button magnets, place a drop of glue on the top and bottom of the clothespin back.",
    "Press the round button magnets into the glue.",
    "Allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.",
    "Once the glue dries, you can use the clothespin to hold recipes and memos to the door of your fridge.",
    "Making a Stamped Clay Magnet Gather your supplies.",
    "You can make beautiful magnets out of clay and rubber stamps.",
    "Paper clay dries white, making it the perfect surface to paint on.",
    "It also dries lightweight, so it won't slide down the door of the fridge.",
    "Here's a list of what you will need: \nAir dry paper clay\nRolling pin\nCookie cutters or craft knife\nRubber stamps\nInk pad (optional)\nClear acrylic sealer\nRound button magnet\nHot glue or industrial strength glue Roll out some air dry paper clay until it is about 5 mm thick.",
    "You don't want to make it too thin or too thick, or it may crack while it dries.",
    "Paper clay is great, because it dries very lightweight.",
    "Use a rubber stamp to imprint some designs into the clay.",
    "You will be punching out shapes later.",
    "This is to give the shapes some texture and design.",
    "You can use ornate designs, such as damask and scrolls.",
    "You can also use pictures or symbols, such as a cat, dog, heart, or star.",
    "If you want your design to be colored, then press your rubber stamp into a colored ink pad first.",
    "The color will transfer to the clay, along with your design.",
    "You can also use ornate buttons or brooches to stamp designs.",
    "Use a cookie cutter or a craft knife to cut shapes into your clay.",
    "You can make any shape you want, but simpler shapes (such as circles and squares) might show off your design better.",
    "Let the clay dry.",
    "Depending on how dry or humid it is, this can take several hours or overnight.",
    "Use a fine-grit sandpaper to buff away any ragged edges.",
    "If the cookie cutters didn't cut clean, you can smooth the edges down with some sandpaper.",
    "Consider painting your piece.",
    "You can paint it using some watercolor paints or acrylic paints.",
    "Watercolor paints will give you a sheer finish, and acrylic paints will give you a more opaque finish.",
    "Allow the paint to dry before moving on.",
    "Seal the front and back of your clay piece.",
    "The clay will dry matte, but if you use a glossy sealer, you will get a glazed look.",
    "Seal the front first and let it dry before sealing the back.",
    "This will help your piece last longer.",
    "It will also prevent the magnet from peeling off.",
    "You can spray it with a clear acrylic spray sealer.",
    "You can also apply some Mod Podge over it instead using a paintbrush or a foam brush.",
    "Glue a round magnet to the back of your clay piece.",
    "You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue.",
    "Allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.",
    "Hot glue sets quickly, but industrial strength glues require several hours to dry and cure.",
    "Refer to the label on your glue as each brand is a little different."
