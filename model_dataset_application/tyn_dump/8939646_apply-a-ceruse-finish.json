Because it\u2019s such a versatile finish, it makes a great way to spruce up old, humdrum wooden items and give them some contemporary flair. The key is to look for surfaces with distinct grain patterns that you can coax out with layers of color. Experiment with used or salvaged pieces before attempting to refinish more expensive items. Working in a bright, well-ventilated area will allow you to see in better detail and disperse the fumes from stains, pigments and sealants."

Use mineral spirits or a chemical wood stripper to eat away at the existing finish. When the original wood has been uncovered, wipe it down with a mild soap solution. Adding moisture to the stripped wood will cause the grain to expand, helping it stand out after being buried beneath a sealed finish for so long.

Sanding will also help remove unattractive chalky residue from the lighter colored pigment from the outside of the wood. Avoid applying too much pressure with the sandpaper, or you could accidentally scrape off some of the pigment."
