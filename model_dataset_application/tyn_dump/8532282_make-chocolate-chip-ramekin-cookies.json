Use a metal whisk to beat the butter, egg, sugar and vanilla until they take on a whipped, fluffy texture. It may be necessary to whisk quite vigorously to ensure that the sugar granules dissolve properly. Otherwise, your cookie make come out with a gritty texture.

Use a spatula to distribute the chips throughout the cookie dough. You should now have a little ball of batter that\u2019s the perfect size for a single-serve cookie! If you\u2019d rather wait to bake the cookies, place the dough in an airtight container or cover it in plastic wrap and stick it in the refrigerator until you need it.

When the top grows firm and turns a dark golden-brown color, the cookie is done! For gooey cookies with a hot molten center, bake for 12-15 minutes. For firmer cookies baked all the way through, drop the temperature to 325 degrees F (162\u00b0C) and increase the bake time by 2-5 minutes. Because of the thickness of ramekin cookies, they tend to have more of a cake-like consistency than thinner, crispier cookies. Depending on the size of the ramekin you use, your cookie may need a little more or less time in the oven. Keep an eye on it and use your best judgment to decide when it\u2019s ready."

The outer crust will provide a crisp first bite, while the chocolate chips inside will be gooey and decadent. Give the cookie a minute or two to cool, then dig in! Reheat leftover cookies for a couple minutes in a conventional or toaster oven, or for about twenty seconds in the microwave."
