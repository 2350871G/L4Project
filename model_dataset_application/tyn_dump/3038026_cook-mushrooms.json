Chanterelles can be intimidating to clean at first, but they are not overly difficult to clean once you know what to do. Use a soft toothbrush or nylon mushroom brush to scrub off any dirt or debris from the smooth surface of each mushroom. Then, brush out the gills of each mushroom with the same brush while holding the mushroom under cool running water. Do not soak the mushrooms. For this method of preparation, you should use a sharp kitchen knife to cut each chanterelle into halves or quarters. These mushrooms are meaty and best enjoyed in large chunks."

    "Beat the egg in a medium to large mixing bowl.",
    "Gently beat the egg with a fork until the yolk and white are mixed.",
    "Add the remaining batter ingredients.",
    "Stir the cold water, flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt into the beaten egg.",
    "Continue mixing with a whisk until a thin batter forms.",
    "You can use either pastry flour or all-purpose flour for this batter.",
    "Pastry flour is less dense and will create a lighter batter.",
    "Coat the mushrooms.",
    "Dip the mushroom pieces into the batter a few at a time, turning them with a fork to coat all sides.",
    "When you remove the mushrooms from the batter, you should hold each piece above the mixing bowl for several seconds to allow excess batter to drip off.",
    "Deep-fry the mushrooms.",
    "Add the oyster mushrooms to the hot oil in small batches and cook for several minutes, or until they turn a rich golden-brown.",
    "Monitor the temperature of the oil as you fry the mushrooms.",
    "The temperature will fluctuate as the mushrooms are added and removed.",
    "Adjust the heat supply as needed to make up for this.",
    "Drain and serve.",
    "Remove the mushrooms from the hot oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on several layers of clean paper towels.",
    "Serve them immediately.",
    "Portobello Mushrooms[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Prepare the mushrooms.",
    "Portobello mushrooms need to be cleaned and trimmed before you cook them.",
    "Wipe the mushrooms down with a clean, moist paper towel or kitchen washcloth.",
    "Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut off the stems.",
    "The stems are fairly woody and fibrous, so you may discard them.",
    "Otherwise, save them for use in a flavor stock later on.",
    "Scrape out the dark black gills.",
    "These are edible, but the appearance leaves much to be desired, so they are usually removed.",
    "Pry the gills out with the tip of a metal spoon.",
    "Do not use the side of the spoon.",
    "You should be able to dig the gills out in neat, small chunks and avoid staining the cap.",
    "Score the cap.",
    "Use a small paring knife to cut a light \u201cx\u201d onto the top side of each cap.",
    "Scoring the caps will let the steam escape more easily.",
    "As a result, the mushrooms will cook more evenly, faster, and with minimal distortion or shrinkage.",
    "Mix your marinade.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, onion, garlic, and vinegar until thoroughly combined.",
    "Marinate the portobello mushrooms.",
    "Place the caps on a plate with high sides and pour the marinade over them.",
    "Let sit in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes.",
    "Portobello mushrooms are one of the few mushrooms that take well to being marinated, but you should still avoid marinating them for more than 1 hour.",
    "Place the caps top-side-down when arranging them on your plate.",
    "Preheat a grill to high heat.",
    "Oil your grill grate to prevent the mushrooms from sticking and preheat your grill to a medium-high or high temperature.",
    "If using a gas grill, preheat most of the burners to medium-high or high.",
    "Give the grill a few minutes to heat up.",
    "If using a charcoal grill, pile a thick pile of charcoal in the center of the grill, add your lighter fluid, and light them up.",
    "Allow the fire to die down and do not add your mushrooms until white ash begins to form on the top of the coals.",
    "Grill the mushrooms for 10 minutes.",
    "Arrange the portobello caps on your preheated grill top-side-down.",
    "Cook for 10 minutes without turning them, or until the caps are well browned, tender, and somewhat shrunken.",
    "Serve immediately.",
    "Remove the portobello mushrooms from the grill and serve as a light vegetarian meal.",
    "Shiitake Mushrooms[6]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Heat oil or butter in a large skillet.",
    "Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of butter or cooking oil, such as olive oil or canola oil, to a large skillet and heat over medium.",
    "Prepare the mushrooms.",
    "Shiitake mushrooms should be cleaned and trimmed before cooking them using this method.",
    "To clean the mushrooms, either rinse them quickly under cool running water or wipe the caps clean with a damp paper towel.",
    "Do not soak.",
    "Use a sharp paring knife to trim the stems at the point where they attach to the cap.",
    "The stems are too tough to eat, so you can discard them or use them to add flavor to stock later on.",
    "Use your knife to cut the shiitake mushroom caps into small, bite-size pieces.",
    "Add the shiitake mushrooms to the hot oil.",
    "Toss the shiitake mushroom caps into the pan of hot oil.",
    "Use a heat-resistant spatula to spread the mushrooms out so that each cap touches the bottom of the pan.",
    "Cook for 10 minutes.",
    "Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms over medium heat, stirring them frequently with your spatula until they turn an even and rich brown.",
    "Season and serve.",
    "Remove the cooked mushrooms from the heat and season with salt and pepper, as desired.",
    "Toss to coat before serving."
