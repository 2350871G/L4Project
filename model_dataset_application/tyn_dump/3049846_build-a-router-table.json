Use a pencil to draw a line on the tabletop in the shape of the acrylic. If you want more counter space to hold tools or materials, make the square closer to the front.

Test how the acrylic fits inside the tabletop and continue to make adjustments as you need them. The router will make curved corners on the tabletop, so you need to round the acrylic so it matches. Installing the Router Make a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) round hole in the center of the acrylic sheet. Use a hole saw attachment for your drill in the center of the acrylic sheet to make your cut.

Attach the router to the underside of the acrylic with screws. Set your router upside down and place the sheet of acrylic on top of it. Line up the holes so the center is over the router bit and the mounting holes line up. Use a drill to attach the screws to your router to the acrylic so it holds firmly in place. Drop the acrylic and router into the table so it fits flush. Carefully feed the power cord through the hole in the tabletop and set your router inside so the acrylic sheet sits on the ledge. Make sure the acrylic is flush with the tabletop. Once the router and acrylic are in place, you can plug it in and it's ready to use! If you ever need to remove your router, lift it out of the hole and unscrew it from the acrylic sheet.",
