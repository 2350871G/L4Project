          "description":"Hold the bottle by the neck with your non-dominant hand so there\u2019s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the top of your hand and the cap. Position the edge of a metal spoon underneath the cap and rest the handle against your hand. Push down on the handle to pry the bottle cap off of the bottle. Be sure to use a spoon that that won\u2019t bend or deform when you apply pressure to it."

Push the handles down and slightly squeeze them together to pry open the bottle and pop off the cap. Alternatively, you could try to cut along the ridges on the cap until it comes loose from the bottle. Make sure the scissors are pointed away from you so they won\u2019t cut you in case they slip."

Hold the bottle securely in place with your non-dominant hand while you hit the cap with your dominant hand. It may take 2-3 hits to fully remove the cap, but it will come off due to the force. Be careful not to break the bottle while you hit it. The drink inside the bottle may start to foam up if it\u2019s carbonated. Make sure it doesn\u2019t spill onto anything you can\u2019t easily clean.Warning: This may damage your countertops so only do it if you\u2019re sure your counters can handle it. Avoid doing this on wooden countertops since they could easily get nicked or dented."
