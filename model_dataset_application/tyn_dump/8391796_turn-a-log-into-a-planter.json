          "description":"You can make a planter out of any size log that you like. However, keep in mind that larger logs can weigh a great deal, which makes them difficult to move around your yard or deck. In general, try to find a log with a diameter of approximately 12- to 14-inches (30- to 35-cm)\nA log that\u2019s approximately 45-inches (114-cm) long is usually a good size for a planter. You can go smaller or larger, though, depending on how much space you have in your yard and how many flowers you\u2019d like to plant. When it comes to the type of log to use, a harder wood will usually last longer. However, hard woods are more difficult to cut. Maple is a good option."

          "description":"You can make the opening in your log planter as small or as large as you\u2019d like. You can make it almost as long and as wide as the log itself, so nearly the entire top of the log is available for planting. You can also opt for a smaller opening so more of the log is visible. It\u2019s best to use a tape measure when you\u2019re trying to decide how large to make the planter opening. That will help you understand how much space that you have to work with."

          "description":"Part of the charm of a log planter is its rustic appearance. However, you may want to strip the bark off of the log to expose the bare wood underneath. You can use a debarking tool, such as a draw knife, to manually remove the bark or a debarker that attaches to the end of a chainsaw and uses a rotating blade to remove the bark much more quickly. If there are any twigs, moss, and other debris on the exterior of the log, you may wish to remove those as well."

Make sure the wedges have a flat edge so they won\u2019t move when you begin to cut. When you\u2019re choosing a location to set the log up for cutting, it\u2019s best to select a spot that\u2019s close to where you plan to put the planter.

It\u2019s also a good idea to wear a pair of canvas or leather work gloves to protect your skin. You may also want to wear a dust mask over your nose and mouth to protect yourself from the sawdust and chips that fly around when you\u2019re cutting the log."

You don\u2019t need to cut the full depth of the opening -- just make a superficial score line. For best results, use a chainsaw with a low kickback blade.

Make sure that you join the short side cuts with the long side cuts so the opening is cut to the desired depth all the way around. Hollowing Out the Log Create several lengthwise cuts to the center of the opening cut out. After you\u2019ve cut out the entire outline of the planter\u2019s opening, use the chainsaw to make several lengthwise cuts in the center of the opening. It\u2019s best to create 3 to 4 cuts that are parallel to one another. The lengthwise center cuts should all be the same depth. Saw diagonally along the center of the opening cut out. Once you\u2019ve made the lengthwise center cuts in the opening, make several diagonal cuts to the center portion of the opening that you\u2019re going to hollow out. They should crisscross the lengthwise cuts that you made previously. The diagonal cuts should be just as deep as the lengthwise cuts to the center of the cutout. Use a hatchet to remove the wood from the opening cut out. When the planter\u2019s opening has been completely scored, you\u2019ll be left with chunks of wood in the center. Cut this wood out with a hatchet or ax until you\u2019ve created a complete opening for the planter. Create drainage for the planter with the chainsaw. To prevent the planter from becoming waterlogged, it helps to create drainage slits in the bottom. Use the chainsaw to cut all the way through the bottom of the planter opening in three to four spots so the water can drain out. Be sure to elevate the log on a sawhorse before you cut the drainage slits. You may damage the chain on your chainsaw if you allow the blade to hit the ground. Setting Up the Planter Set the planter in its spot. Once you\u2019ve finished cutting the log, it\u2019s time to set the planter in the spot where you want to keep it. It\u2019s important to move it before you fill it with soil and plants because it may be too heavy to move afterward. If you like, you can elevate the log planter on two or more flat pieces of wood.
