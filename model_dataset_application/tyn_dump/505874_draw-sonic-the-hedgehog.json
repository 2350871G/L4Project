  "text":" Steps Draw a medium-sized circle. This will be Sonic's head. Sketch lightly at this point. Underneath the head, draw an oval for his torso. Now, we can begin adding detail! Start with the top circle. Add the spikes that go on top of his head. They are like a saw blade. Draw 2 upside down v's on the head. These will be the character's ears. With the ears, add two bigger v's on top to complete the ears.  For the eyes (and part of the muzzle), draw a butterfly shape.  With the butterfly shape, join it to the head. Make sure the butterfly shape is inside the head first! Move onto the body. Join the head and body by adding a rim outside the oval torso. Draw the arms like you were drawing a couple of bread sticks. Refer to a Sonic picture for help on this. For the hands, make the gloves look like doughnuts.  Now its time for the legs. Draw the legs coming out of the body like sticks. Add detail to the sticks to make them look like his legs.  Do the same doughnuts wrapped round his ankles for the socks.  Draw some triangles for shoes.  Add detail to the shoes. For example, buckles, stripes, etc. Add detail to rest of the drawing.  Erase extra lines.  Go over lines using a black felt tip marker.  Add color!  Alternate Method Draw a circle. Then add a spiky shape. This will serve as the outline of Sonic's head. Add vertical and horizontal lines. These will help you later when you draw his face. Merge the circle and the spiky shape together. Using the guidelines from the previous step, add his eyes, right ear, nose and mouth. Draw the shape of his body.  Outline his hands and shoes. Make them slightly larger than usual. Have his right hand making a thumbs-up sign. Add details. For example, add lines for the folds of his gloves and add detail to Sonic's shoes. Continue adding details. For example, draw his tail and the spikes on his back. Sketch circles behind Sonic to serve as a background. Start outlining Sonic by using a pen or marker and erasing pencil marks. Outline the background circles.  Color your artwork. Sonic is usually blue, has green eyes and wears red shoes.",
