REMOVE POWER:  Remove the two \"D\"-sized batteries to prevent inadvertent Wick or fuel ignition.  SECTION A: SERVICING THE BURNER WICK (REPLACEMENT) REMOVE GRILL CAP:  Using a #2-Phillips screwdriver, loosen the two screws that secure the Grill Cap to the Grill. Turn the Cap counter-clockwise until the screws clear their slots and then lift the Cap off. REMOVE CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY:  Reach down through the top of the Grill, grasp the Chimney Assembly, and lift straight out. Notice in the photo the heavy carbon-buildup on the glass Chimney Collar...this unit will require maintenance. REMOVE GRILL AND BASE ASSEMBLY:  Facing the front of the heater, use a #2-Phillips screwdriver to remove the (3)-1/2\" screws (one on the left panel, one on the right panel, and one on the rear panel just above the Battery Holder). Grasp the Grill and gently lift while tilting and sliding the assembly forward to clear the Wick Control Knob, the Shut-off Lever, and the Igniter Button. DISENGAGE SPRING CASE:  Disengage the spring case by turning it counterclockwise enough to where the tab on the spring case clears its locking-seat. Prior to disengaging the spring case, depress the shut-off lever to insure that the wick assembly (chimney) is fully in the down-position, otherwise there could very well be tension on the spring case which could lead to personal injury or damage to the spring case when it is disengaged.

Removing the insulation plates (aka the heat-dam decking) involves removing the four(4)-wingnuts on the base of the assembly that attaches it to the fuel reservoir. Prior to lifting off the plates, be aware that:\nThe plates themselves are two-halves joined together by interlocking tabs (we are removing these as a single assembly), and\nThe Ignition Device Assembly is still attached to the Battery Holder by its two electrical wires. If just replacing the wick, the plates can be gently lifted straight up off the mounting studs and placed safely off to one side to allow further work. Disengage wick control gear shaft. Grasp the gear-shaft and pull outwards until it cannot go any further. This will disengage the raise/lower control gear on the end of the wick control gear shaft from the wick assembly. Using both hands for this step, grasp a hold of the wick assembly (chimney) by the lip of the outer metal cylinder (known as the wick holder), and slowly remove the assembly by lifting it straight upwards until it clears the inner cylinder (known as the wick guide cylinder).  Install the replacement wick. The actual wick itself is held inside the wick Holder by a number sharp metal \"spikes\" that pierce the wick material to hold it in place.

REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #1: Insure that the Chimney Assembly is put together correctly if it has been taken apart. Make sure that the rods are fully inserted, tight(do not move), and that the Chimney Rod Retaining Washers are firmly attached and seated. REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #2: When reinstalling the Chimney Assembly, make sure that the assembly is firmly and properly seated on top of the Wick Assembly. Also, insure that the Wick moves freely upwards into the Chimney without it binding or disturbing the assembly. If it does, some trimming of the wick-top may be necessary. REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #3: When reinstalling the Wick Assembly, make sure that it freely moves up and down on the Wick Guide Cylinder without any sort of binding or hesitation.  REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #4: When the Wick is installed into the Wick Holder double-check that it is installed and fully seated on the spikes at its correct position as specified by the manufacturer  REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #5: Spring Case is properly functioning by setting the Shut-off Lever, running the wick all the way up, depressing the Shut-off Lever, and then observing that the Spring Case freely brings the Wick Assembly rapidly down to its full-bottom position (shutoff position).  REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #6: It is CRITICAL to verify that the Emergency Shutoff Device is properly functioning. The Tilt-Weight (situated on top of the Emergency Shut-off Device...aka Wick Control Assembly) properly functions by setting the Shut-off Lever, running the Wick all the way up, and then tapping the Weight with your finger. When the Weight \"bobs\" or falls-over it should trip the Spring Case and as a result, lower the Wick Assembly to its full-bottom position (shutoff position). REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #7: After refilling the Fuel Reservoir, wait a minimum of two-hours before attempting to ignite the Wick to insure that the Kerosene has had time to fully wick-up into the material, otherwise damage to the Wick can occur.  REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #8: Visually inspect the Ignition Glow Plug to make sure it is in good working condition. The coil element should not be \"bowed\" in shape, or \"sagging\"...if so, it must be replaced.",

    "REMOVE POWER:  Remove the two \"D\"-sized batteries to prevent inadvertent Wick or fuel ignition.",
    "SECTION A: SERVICING THE BURNER WICK (REPLACEMENT) REMOVE GRILL CAP:  Using a #2-Phillips screwdriver, loosen the two screws that secure the Grill Cap to the Grill.",
    "Turn the Cap counter-clockwise until the screws clear their slots and then lift the Cap off.",
    "REMOVE CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY:  Reach down through the top of the Grill, grasp the Chimney Assembly, and lift straight out.",
    "Notice in the photo the heavy carbon-buildup on the glass Chimney Collar...this unit will require maintenance.",
    "REMOVE GRILL AND BASE ASSEMBLY:  Facing the front of the heater, use a #2-Phillips screwdriver to remove the (3)-1/2\" screws (one on the left panel, one on the right panel, and one on the rear panel just above the Battery Holder).",
    "Grasp the Grill and gently lift while tilting and sliding the assembly forward to clear the Wick Control Knob, the Shut-off Lever, and the Igniter Button.",
    "DISENGAGE SPRING CASE:  Disengage the spring case by turning it counterclockwise enough to where the tab on the spring case clears its locking-seat.",
    "Prior to disengaging the spring case, depress the shut-off lever to insure that the wick assembly (chimney) is fully in the down-position, otherwise there could very well be tension on the spring case which could lead to personal injury or damage to the spring case when it is disengaged.",
    "If you are just replacing the wick the spring case can be left on the shaft in the disengaged position, otherwise slide the Spring Case off the shaft.",
    "The wick-controlling spring case serves as a spring-tensioner against the wick assembly when the it is in the raised (up) position.",
    "This allows spring-action to rapidly lower the wick when either the shut-off lever depressed (without controlling the spin on the wick control knob), or in the event the heater is tilted or jilted enough to the point where the emergency shut-off device (also known as the wick control assembly) is tripped and the heater is automatically shutdown.",
    "As a precaution against damaging the delicate Ignition glow plug, remove it by gently pushing it backwards down into its socket (it's spring-loaded) and turning it counter-clockwise until the locking pin has disengaged and cleared its notch-seat.",
    "Removing the insulation plates (aka the heat-dam decking) involves removing the four(4)-wingnuts on the base of the assembly that attaches it to the fuel reservoir.",
    "Prior to lifting off the plates, be aware that:\nThe plates themselves are two-halves joined together by interlocking tabs (we are removing these as a single assembly), and\nThe Ignition Device Assembly is still attached to the Battery Holder by its two electrical wires.",
    "If just replacing the wick, the plates can be gently lifted straight up off the mounting studs and placed safely off to one side to allow further work.",
    "Disengage wick control gear shaft.",
    "Grasp the gear-shaft and pull outwards until it cannot go any further.",
    "This will disengage the raise/lower control gear on the end of the wick control gear shaft from the wick assembly.",
    "Using both hands for this step, grasp a hold of the wick assembly (chimney) by the lip of the outer metal cylinder (known as the wick holder), and slowly remove the assembly by lifting it straight upwards until it clears the inner cylinder (known as the wick guide cylinder).",
    "Install the replacement wick.",
    "The actual wick itself is held inside the wick Holder by a number sharp metal \"spikes\" that pierce the wick material to hold it in place.",
    "Remove the old wick by compressing it off the \"spikes\" and properly dispose of it.",
    "To install the new wick, refer to the manufacturers instructions and follow accordingly (see the photo for an example).",
    "Once the wick is properly positioned inside the holder, simply press the wick against the spikes until they pierce the outer material and the wick is firmly impaled and cannot slide up and down inside the holder.",
    "Reassembly (for wick replacement only).",
    "At this point, should the user only be replacing the wick, no further disassembly is necessary.",
    "Reassembly of the heater is essentially the reverse of those prior steps that apply only to the wick replacement objective with a few minor precautions discussed in subsequent steps below.",
    "Recommendation to the user is to review these precautions to insure a smooth and trouble-free reassembly.",

    "Note that the control-knob screw is machined with left hand threads!",
    "To remove the screw it must be turned to the right.",
    "After the knob has been removed, also remove the control dial directly behind the knob.",
    "This dial-indicator has a large spring behind it that keeps it snug to the rear of the control-knob.",
    "Remove the wick control gear assembly (skip this step if just replacing the wick).",
    "Remove the gear assembly by pulling the gear itself off the gear-shaft.",
    "Be aware that the metal tabs in front of the gear are actually a part of the assembly and care must be taken as to not bend, twist, or otherwise damage these tabs.",
    "Also, there is a coil-spring loaded into the face of the gear and care must be observed as to not allow the spring to disengage form its securing pins or become disengaged from the gear-face.",
    "Remove wick guide cylinder top.",
    "Removal of the wick guide cylinder top requires special attention due to the type of screws that are used to fasten the top to the guide cylinder.",
    "These screws (as shown in the photo) have a smooth shank between the threads and the head of the screw which prevent them from inadvertently backing out caused by repeated heating and cooling.",
    "To remove these screws, lift and hold the screws up as far as they will go and then using a Phillips screwdriver, remove them.",
    "Remove emergency shut-off device (aka the wick control assembly).",
    "Using a 3/4\" wrench, loosen the nut through which the wick control gear shaft passes and is holding the emergency shut-off device assembly to the fuel reservoir (the nut itself cannot be removed from the shaft from either end unless the rolling pin piercing the shaft is also removed).",
    "Once the nut has come loose, pull the gear-shaft out and then lift off the emergency shut-off device.",
    "Remove battery holder.",
    "The battery holder is fastened onto the fuel reservoir by a single 9/32\" nut.",
    "Remove it and lift the holder off the stud taking care that it is also still attached to the ignition device assembly and the insulation plates.",
    "Remove grill base mountain brackets.",
    "There are two additional grill base mounting brackets besides the battery holder bracket, that serve to hold the grill and its base.",

    ": SERVICING THE CHIMNEY This section deals with the steps necessary to disassemble the Aladdin TR5000 Kerosene Heater Chimney Assembly.",
    "Overhaul of the Chimney Assembly is usually unnecessary except in instances when there is excessive carbon buildup or damage to the assembly at some point has occurred.",
    "REMOVE CHIMNEY WIRE COIL: Begin this subsection by gently removing the Chimney Wire Coil from the assembly.",
    "REMOVE CHIMNEY ROD RETAINING WASHERS: Two metal rods that crisscross the bottom of the Chimney Assembly hold the entire assembly together as one unit.",
    "These rods are held in place by two(2)-pressure washers that must be carefully removed without damage.",
    "The tool shown here is a typical metal pick manufactured by Stanley Tools and is used to gently lift the tabs one-at-a-time working the washer off the rod.",
    "Once the washers have been removed, the rods can then be extracted from the Chimney Assembly.",
    "CAUTION!",
    "Take care when the final rod is removed and the assembly comes apart that the tempered-Glass Chimney Collar is not allowed to break...they are somewhat EXPENSIVE!",
    "!",
    "DISASSEMBLE CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY: Once the rods have been removed, the entire assembly freely comes apart.",
    "The individual parts should be arranged according to their position in the assembly and closely inspected for any damage or possible material failures (cracked metal, glass, etc.)",
    "If any damage or failures are found, the part must be replaced as this assembly receives the most stress during its operational lifetime and in not doing so may possibly result in failure of the heater which becomes a potential fire hazard!",
    "CLEANING OF CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY: The most common need for disassembly of the Chimney Assembly is to remove excessive carbon buildup.",
    "Excessive buildup is the direct result of (1) Old or dirty wicks, (2) Old or contaminated Kerosene, (3) Excessive Wick height due to improper installation or incorrect Wick model, or (4) Chimney Assembly not seated down properly onto the Wick Assembly.",
    "This carbon can be removed with mild-soap and water.",
    "CAUTION!",
    "The Carbon buildup is an extremely fine residue...take safety precautions to prevent inhalation, contact with the skin, or contact with clothing as it is difficult to remove.",
    "REASSEMBLY OF CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY: Assembly of the Wick Chimney is reverse of its disassembly.",
    "NOTE: Trial and error is usually a requirement when reinstalling the rods in getting the correct combination of holes to line up through all sections of the assembly...take your time and have patience...they'll go in there!",
    "CLEANING OF THE FUEL RESERVOIR: The fuel tank can usually be cleaned with a soap and water solution or a mild solvent.",
    "If there are more severe issues such as rust, corrosion, or etching there are methods on the Internet that can be used to remove such as these but serious safety consideration in replacing the Reservoir should be taken into account.",
    "CLEANING OF GRILL, GRILL CAP, GRILL HANDLE: These parts over time will develop corrosion and rust due to being repeatedly exposed to rapid heating and cooling.",
    "Rust can be removed using various grades of wire-brushes and in delicate areas, scouring-pads work well.",
    "After brushing down the rusted areas they should be cleaned with a mild soap and water.",
    "If repainting is desired (such as the Grill-Cap) a heat-tolerant paint is required!",
    "REASSEMBLY OF THE HEATER: Reassembling the Aladdin TR5000 is essentially the reverse of the above steps.",
    "REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #1: Insure that the Chimney Assembly is put together correctly if it has been taken apart.",
    "Make sure that the rods are fully inserted, tight(do not move), and that the Chimney Rod Retaining Washers are firmly attached and seated.",
    "REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #2: When reinstalling the Chimney Assembly, make sure that the assembly is firmly and properly seated on top of the Wick Assembly.",
    "Also, insure that the Wick moves freely upwards into the Chimney without it binding or disturbing the assembly.",
