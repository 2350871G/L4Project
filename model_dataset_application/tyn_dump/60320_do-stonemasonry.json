This means you'll need a tightly strung string that is strung from above where you're working and all the way down to the bottom at a specific measurement. So suppose you're wrapping your stone around a pillar and your distance is two and a half inches away from the wall; cut a 2x4 at about a six inch length. Then get some particle board and cut it in a long strip. Drill the six inch long 2x4 to the particle board with two screws so that the tension in the line doesn't cause the 2x4 to pivot. Drill the particle board to the wall. Measure from the two walls two and a half inches and make those measurement marks on the 2x4. Extend those marks with a square to the point to where the measurement marks intersect. Drill a screw into that intersection point, but don't drill it 100% into the wood. Leave some of the screw out a little ways. Now, tie a stiff and durable string to that screw you just drilled. Make sure that the string reaches all the way to the bottom with a little extra remaining."

So make sure you measure as much of everything that seems important and even some of the things you'd usually not consider. Just measure, measure, and measure some more. It's hard to get to the point to where you're measuring too much."

      "description":"For example, you'll be picking up this big heavy stone and moving it around and making marks on the stone and cutting it a little bit, then repeating this process in order to finally lay the stone. The more you play with a stone, the more likely it's going to break. So you can either work with lots and lots of small rock, or you can use a template. This is a trick of the trade! Buy some wire that's not tie wire. (Tie wire is too stiff, you need some wire that you can move and shape easily; usually this means having a thinner caliber of wire. However, if it's too thin it won't hold its shape and it'll sag and waste your time.) Find a brand of wire that you're comfortable with. Get a good length of wire, cut it, then wrap the two ends together. You should have a circular-looking type of wire. Put it in those difficult to cut places and shape it to the shape the outer portions the shone should be. Shape it so that it's not touching any of the already laid stones. Spend an extra minute or two just to make sure it's right. Working a little longer on a light piece of wire is much faster and easier than having to pick up a heavy stone, mark it a little bit, cut, then mark again, and cut, and repeat this process however many times is necessary to get it right. Hopefully you've shaped the wire properly. Place it atop your stone. If you have a pencil or Sharpie marker, place the wire onto the stone and mark it from the inside of the wire. (Make sure you don't invert your template, otherwise your stone will be worthless. Sometimes you can salvage it by flipping the stone, but if you undercut it probably won't be; so there are downsides to undercutting, but it does more good than bad). Once you've marked your stone, put your stone to that shape and it should fit perfectly into place."

You'd wind up with a bundle of X joints. If they were a map they'd be four-way stops rather than T intersections. These are bad. They look ugly and usually cause a running joint. A running joint is a joint that extends more than three feet. Those are bad. Why? Because as the stonemasonry ages sometimes cracks form.

Be sure to stretch it out. Mark the shape of the stone you're going to cut. Write TOP in the middle of the plastic template so that you don't invert the stone.

    "Chisels",
    ": There are two types of chisels.  Of course, there are many different shapes for different purposes for different breaking of the stone, but I'm talking about grades of chisels.  There are chisels you can buy at essentially any Home Depot or Lowes that are entirely made out of steel.  These are \"okay\".  They get the job done.  They're usually used the most because they're expendable, however there are downsides to using these. You have to constantly check to see if they're sharp.  If they're not sharp then you'll break the stone improperly, which can sometimes set you back about an hour or two and most stonemasons are paid by the square foot, rather than by the hour.  Now, the second type of chisel are those called Carbon Tipped Chisels.  These obviously have a special tip that never dulls.  The downside is that they're expensive and because they're so pricey, you'll only want to use them when you're doing something complicated with a stone but you'll still have to be familiar enough with them that you'll know the proper techniques to not screw up.",
    "Trowel",
    ": A Marshall Town or a Rose is recommended.  Both of these are high quality. Just get a conventional bricklayer's sized trowel. Cut a somewhat forty five degree angle off the trowel about four inches down from the tip - this is so that you can move mud around more efficiently, scoop more cement out of the bucket at one time and scrape it out of the bottom with ease.",
    "Grinder",
    ": this is essential.  The best brand can only be purchased at The Home Depot.  It's a Ridgid grinder.  Basically, they're so good because when they lock up, they react in such a way that they don't burn up the engine; they just last longer and they're a great thing.  If you want details about it then go to Ridgid.com and read up on them yourself. All Ridgid tools are pretty good.  They're a little pricey, but they'll last long enough to make your money well spent.  Anyway, grinders are helpful.  It's best to use them outside because they kick up quite a bit of dust and you don't want to breathe that indoors.  The downside is that you probably shouldn't cut stone any deeper than a half-inch, otherwise you'll overheat the diamond blade and chip it, cause the grinder to bind up and overwork its engine. The only time cutting deeper with a grinder is ok is when you're squirting a constant stream of water on the blade as you're cutting the stone but usually there are other tools for deeper cuts.  Usually a deep scoring of the stone is all that's truly needed. Sometimes you need to cut deeper, or even all the way through the stone and you'll know when you'll need to do that. But usually a deep score will cause a weakness point in the stone to the point where if you strike the stone with a hammer and chisel on the score, it'll usually break along that scoring.  Just be smart about how hard you hit and where you hit.  It's not rocket science, but it's not easy all the time.",
    "Wet Saw",
    ": Most stonemasons make their own.  They buy a conventional old saw and purchase a syphon kit and custom tailor it to work. The reason for a wet saw is so that you can cut all the way through stones as as to not kick up dust everywhere, but they're wet so they're a little messy.  They're great for working indoors, but you'll usually have to cover up your surrounding area so that it doesn't get dirty.  These are also great when you need really deep cuts in really thick stone.",
    "Blades",
    ": So what's a grinder and a wet saw worth if you don't have a diamond blade? Purchase Cherokee blades.  They last a long time.  They're usually a little pricey, but they usually are a high enough quality to make your money well spent.  They're usually reliable.",
    "Hammer Drills",
    ": These are handy.  They save time and they're efficient. There's a technique in using them and that's to keep it in motion.",
    "Drill",
    ": A hammer drill and a drill are completely different.  Hammer drills put bursts of FORCE on and off on during their use, and they're usually heavy duty.  You'll just simply need a normal drill - a cordless one is best as the more cords you have all over the place, the longer it takes to get the day started and finished; cords cause more work because  you have to pay more attention to avoiding them and that will irritate you because cords are the last thing you want to worry about as you're working along.  These will be mostly used in putting in wall ties."
