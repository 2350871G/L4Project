Once you reach the other end, write down the measurement rounded up to the nearest whole number so you have a little extra when you need to calculate. Continue finding the lengths of each wall you plan on putting wallpaper on, and write each of them down so you don\u2019t forget. For example, if the length of one wall is 119 \u20444 inches (302.9 cm), then round it up to 120 inches (304.8 cm). If your room is rectangular, then you only need to find the lengths of 2 walls since the ones on the opposite side of the room will be the same measurement."

Place the end of your tape measure against the wall and extend it up toward the ceiling. Keep pulling the tape measure out until it reaches the floor so you can find the measurement. Round your measurement up to the closest whole number so you can have some excess wallpaper. For example, if your wall is 95 \u20442 inches (242.6 cm) tall, round it up to 96 inches (243.8 cm) instead."

If you were measuring the lengths and width in inches, divide each of your measurements by 12 to find the total distance in feet. If you found the length in centimeters, divide the measurements by 100 to calculate the wall dimensions in meters. For example, if your wall is 120 inches (304.8 cm) long, divide it by 12 inches (30.48 cm) to find it\u2019s length in feet or meters, which is 10 feet (3.0 m)."

Multiply the total perimeter by the height of the wall so you can find the total surface area of the room. Use a calculator if you need to so you can find out exactly how much area you need to cover. For example, if your total perimeter was 48 feet (15 m) and the height was 10 feet (3.0 m), then the total surface area equals: (48)(10). Multiply the numbers together to find the solution: (48)(10) = 480 square feet (45 m).Tip: You don\u2019t need to subtract the surface area of your doors or windows since it\u2019s better to have some extra paper rather than too little."

Find the length from one of the bottom corners of the triangle to the other bottom corner to measure the base. Then, measure from the top point of the triangle down to the base to find the height. Multiply the length of the base and the height of the triangle together, and then divide the result by 2 to find the surface area. For example, if the base of the triangle is 10 feet (3.0 m) and the height is 5 feet (1.5 m), then the surface area is (10)(5)/2. Simplify the equation: 50/2 = 25 square feet (2.3 m)."
