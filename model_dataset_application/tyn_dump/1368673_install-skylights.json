          "description":"Most skylights are manufactured with specific roof pitches in mind. It is important to measure the pitch of your roof before purchasing your skylight. Use a level with a ruler on the side to measure the roof run and height to calculate the pitch of your roof. From the side of the house measure from the corner along the wall 12 inches (30.5 cm) and mark the spot with a pencil. Make sure that this line is level using the bubble on your level. Then use a tape measure to measure the distance between the mark and the underside of the roof. Your roof ratio will be this vertical length divided by 12 (for 12 inches). Some skylights are also designed specifically for use on corrugated metal roofs."

This way you can check if there is any special plumbing or electrical wires at this location. If there is anything in the way, it is usually easier to simply choose a new place for the skylight. Otherwise, it is possible to re-route plumbing and wires around the location. The opening should fit in between 2 rafters to prevent structural damage. If you are installing a skylight on a corrugated metal roof then it should be positioned just below the lap of the roofing and aligned with the grooves on the skylight fins."

For those that have a frame in place, the sheathing is a layer that will fit beneath your skylight to help prevent water leaks. For curb-mounted skylights you will need to secure two by sixes (5 cm by 15 cm) along the edges of the opening. To attach the sheathing for frame in place skylights, nail it down around the perimeter of the opening on top of the roof. Then attach a strip of self-adhesive membrane along the bottom edge of the opening. One inch (2.5 cm) of this adhesive should be folded over the edge into the opening of the roof. To create the curb for curb-mounted skylights you must measure the sides of the opening and cut four 2x6s (5 cm by 15 cm) to fit along the upper edges. Nail the four pieces together into the shape of a rectangle. Make sure this box is square and then toenail it into place around the roof opening. Toenailing involves driving the nails in at an angle to securely attach the curb to the roof."

Lower the skylight into place. Rest the skylight against the bottom edge of the opening first and then lower the light onto the roof. If the skylight is curb-mounted then you will need to lift window over the curbs and rest it on top of the sills. Skylights for corrugated metal must be slid under the upper flap of the roof. To slide it under the top flap of roof you will need to make two cuts in the roofing so that the skylight can be slid into location. This protects the roof from water leakage.

Curb-mounted skylights will be attached directly to the curb. Skylights in corrugated metal roofs will be secured with 1 \u00bc inch (31 mm) self-tapping sheet metal screws at 3 inch (7.5 cm) intervals. Preventing Water Leakages Staple roofing felt onto the roof all around the skylight's edges. Staple 18 inch (46 cm) wide roofing felt onto the roof up close to the edges of the skylight. Make sure it surrounds the entire perimeter of the skylight. Add the membrane around the edges of the skylight. Some skylights will recommend a membrane around the edges of the skylight frame or curb that extends 6 inches (15 cm) past the skylight\u2019s sides.

Attach the bottom sill of the flashing. The bottom sill will be a U-shaped metal piece that slips over the bottom of the skylight. Nail it to the side edges of the frame or curb of the skylight. The roofing felt and step flashing helps keep water from leaking around the skylight. The bottom sill flashing for skylights with a frame in place will be nailed directly to the roof at the top outside corners of the sill.

Measure the sides of the openings and create frames from 2x4 (4 x 10 cm) lengths of wood. Attach them to the roof and ceiling to hold the rest of the light shaft frame in place. Cut four 2x4s to fit between the corners of the skylight and ceiling openings and nail them into place. These four 2x4 (5x10 cm) pieces of wood will form the basic frame for the light shaft. Cut the pieces so that they are the correct length to fit between the corresponding corners of the openings and nail them into each of the corners. You will likely need to cut the ends at an angle to fit securely against the ceiling and roof surfaces. Add additional beams so that the width between each beam is about 16 inches (40.5 cm). Add additional beams between the frames of the ceiling and roof. These will be the studs for your drywall installation. Again use 2x4s (5 x 10 cm) to create these beams and nail them into place. Nail in rigid foam insulation around the outside of the shaft. While in the attic, nail rigid foam insulation around the outside of the light shaft frame you have just created. Frame the skylight from inside while on a ladder. Cover the skylight's interior support with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick drywall. Prime and paint the interior around the skylight if needed using the same color paint as your ceiling.",

    "Nail it in on the top outside counter and cover with a shingle.",
    "Continue with the rest of the step flashing.",
    "For the next piece, overlap the next step flashing piece on top of the shingle, again securing with a nail on the top outside corner.",
    "Place another shingle on top of that step flashing piece.",
    "Continue alternating step flashing pieces and shingles on both sides of the skylight.",
    "Cover with the counterflashing.",
    "The counter-flashing will either surround all four sides or just be on the sides of the skylight.",
    "This is essential for preventing water leaks through your skylight so be careful to install the counterflashing correctly.",
    "The counterflashing should simply snap into place.",
    "Counter-flashing is essential for protecting against wind-blown rain and snow.",
    "Add the saddle flashing.",
    "The saddle flashing is the top flashing piece that will cover your skylight.",
    "Lift up the top layer of shingles and slide the saddle flashing into place.",
    "Nail this piece into place underneath the shingles.",
    "Then add a layer of shingles on top of the flashing, making sure to leave 4 inches (10 cm) exposed.",
    "Finishing the Light Shaft Create a frame for the roof and ceiling openings.",
    "Measure the sides of the openings and create frames from 2x4 (4 x 10 cm) lengths of wood.",
    "Attach them to the roof and ceiling to hold the rest of the light shaft frame in place.",
    "Cut four 2x4s to fit between the corners of the skylight and ceiling openings and nail them into place.",
    "These four 2x4 (5x10 cm) pieces of wood will form the basic frame for the light shaft.",
    "Cut the pieces so that they are the correct length to fit between the corresponding corners of the openings and nail them into each of the corners.",
    "You will likely need to cut the ends at an angle to fit securely against the ceiling and roof surfaces.",
    "Add additional beams so that the width between each beam is about 16 inches (40.5 cm).",
    "Add additional beams between the frames of the ceiling and roof.",
    "These will be the studs for your drywall installation.",
    "Again use 2x4s (5 x 10 cm) to create these beams and nail them into place.",
    "Nail in rigid foam insulation around the outside of the shaft.",
    "While in the attic, nail rigid foam insulation around the outside of the light shaft frame you have just created.",
    "Frame the skylight from inside while on a ladder.",
    "Cover the skylight's interior support with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick drywall.",
    "Prime and paint the interior around the skylight if needed using the same color paint as your ceiling."
