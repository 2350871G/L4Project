If you don't have a brie knife, use any knife that has a thin, sharp blade, or even a blade with holes. These are sometimes called open blade knives. If you plan on spreading the brie on a baguette, you may also want to get out a small, pointed cheese knife that you can set next to the cheese. This knife is sometimes called a small spade."

You should now have 2 equal-sized semicircles of cheese. It will be harder to taste the unique flavors of the brie if it's served cold from the refrigerator. If you plan on serving half of the brie, wrap 1 semicircle in parchment or waxed paper and store it in the refrigerator."

Make the wedges about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide at the widest part of the triangle. You can cut from 1 or both sides of the semicircle.Tip: Avoid cutting several triangular pieces of brie in advance because you don't want to let the cheese dry out. If you're serving guests, leave the semicircle of cheese on your platter with the knife next to it. Then, let your guests cut triangular pieces from the cheese. You can store leftover brie as long as it hasn't been out at room temperature for more than 2 hours (including the 1 hour you left the cheese out before serving). Wrap the brie in plastic wrap and put it in an airtight container. Then, refrigerate it for up to 2 to 3 days."

The point of the wedge is called the nose, which is why you might have heard people say, \"Don't cut the nose off of the cheese!\" Removing the Rind Put the brie in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes. Keep the brie in its packaging so it doesn't absorb odor while it's in the freezer. Chilling the brie briefly will make it easier to slice off the rind. You can freeze the brie up to 1 day. Remove the brie and set it on a cutting board. Take the brie out of the freezer at least a few hours before you're going to serve it. Then, unwrap the brie from its packaging and put the cheese on a cutting board. While you want it to drop to room temperature for serving, you should cut the rind off while the cheese is still cold. Turn the brie on its side and cut off the flat sides. If you're cutting a wedge, turn it onto one of its flat sides. If you're cutting a disc of brie, you'll have to move it onto the rounded edge and hold it in place. Then, take a sharp knife and carefully slice away the flat sides of the wedge or disc.Tip: Ensure that you're only trimming off the rind and not cutting into the cheese itself. You can use any type of knife for this step. Trim off the rounded sides or sides of the wedge. Lay the disc or wedge of brie back down onto the cutting board and carefully cut off the rounded edge around the sides of the disc. If you're cutting a wedge, you'll need to trim off the long sides and the flat, wide end of the wedge. Regardless of which style you're cutting, trim about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) of the rind so you don't cut into the cheese itself. If you prefer, switch to a smaller knife to make it easier to cut around the brie's edges. Let the brie come to room temperature. Once you've finished removing the rind, leave it for 1 to 2 hours so it's no longer cold. You and your guests will have an easier time enjoying the flavors of the brie if it's at room temperature.
