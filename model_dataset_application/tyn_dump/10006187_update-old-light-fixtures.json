          "headline":"Find a cardboard box big enough to accommodate your light fixture.",
          "description":"Use an empty cardboard box as your working area to prevent spray paint from ruining any carpeting or furniture. Place the box on its side so that the open end is facing east or west. Try spray painting in a garage, or anywhere you don't mind making a bit of a mess. Make sure you spray paint the fixture in an area with good ventilation to protect your lungs. Additionally, wear protective eyewear."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Place a piece of foam underneath your light fixture.",
          "description":"Line the bottom of your box with foam so you can easily move your fixture by dragging the foam's corners. Foam also gives your fixture a soft floor that won't scratch it. As you paint, you can continuously rotate the foam so that you get all sides of the fixture. Pebble style foam is ideal because the spray paint won't melt it. This kind of foam typically comes packaged with TVs and knock-down furniture. Styrofoam can easily melt if the spray paint is applied too close to the surface of the foam. Use light coats of paint to minimize the chances of your foam melting."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Raise your light fixture with a stick if it's not a flat bottom.",
          "description":"Any light fixture that doesn't have a flat bottom (meaning it tilts to one side if placed on a flat surface) can be held up on top of the foam using a popsicle stick or toothpick. Stick one side of the stick or pick into the foam, and then rest your fixture on the top end. Use the stick to rotate and move your fixture without touching it. As another option, you can hang the light fixture from a wire, which makes it easier to spray paint the light fixture from every angle. For example, you might hang the light fixture from a long tree branch or a beam in your garage."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Wash the fixture in hot water if it's covered in a lacquer.",
          "description":"Most light fixtures are made of brass and typically come with an outer coating of lacquer (a clear finish that covers the piece) to prevent oxidation. If your fixture falls into this category, place the piece into a sink basin and cover it with hot water. This will expand this coating and, once cooled down, it will be easy to peel off. If your piece is small enough, you can boil it in hot water for 2 to 3 minutes using a non-aluminum pot."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Clean and dry your brass light fixture with a cloth and lukewarm water.",
          "description":"Afterwards, you can use a cloth dipped in lukewarm water and some mild dish soap to clean your brass fixture. If you're not sure whether your fixture is brass, put a magnet to it\u2014if it doesn't cling to it, it's brass. If it clings to it, it's probably iron or steel."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Clean copper fixtures using a cloth with salt and white vinegar.",
          "description":"Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of salt in a bowl and dip a soft cloth into it. Gently rub the surface of your light fixture to clean it. You can also use half of a lemon with salt sprinkled onto it. Just rub the salted side gently onto your fixture. Sprinkle some baking soda onto a cloth with some lemon juice for another simple cleaning tool."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Polish stainless steel fixtures using a cloth and vinegar.",
          "description":"Dilute your vinegar with 1 quart (946 mL) of warm water for every \u20442 cup (120 ml) for light polishing. Clean your fixture with a soft cloth or paper towel and always remember to wipe in the same direction as the grain. Both white and cider vinegar can effectively clean your light fixture, but cider types leave a pleasant smell. Cleaning vinegar is best for light fixtures that have tough stains, as it is more acidic than other types. If you don\u2019t have vinegar, one or two shots of olive oil (around the size of a dime) will work."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose the type of paint your want for your light fixture.",
          "description":"General purpose stray paint is designed to dry quickly with minimal dripping and is your best bet. It comes in many kinds of finishes, including gloss, metallic, stone, textured, and stained glass. Professional enamel paint is great if you're willing to invest a bit more money for higher quality and is designed for corrosion protection and resists fading and cracking. Professional enamel paints dry the fastest (15 minutes or less). Special use paints are ideal for decorative designs and come in forms like glazed pottery, glitter surfaces, and fluorescent paints."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Spray a coat of metal primer onto your light fixture.",
          "description":"These products help paint adhere to metal surfaces. Be sure to give them enough time to dry before you begin paint application. Metal primers can be purchased from local home hardware stores. Before you spray paint your fixture, make sure you cover the wires and light sockets with plastic wrap or painter's tape. This will protect the electrical parts of the fixture from damage."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Apply light and even coats of spray paint onto your light fixture.",
          "description":"Always apply light coats of paint each time you apply spray paint. Heavy coats have a tendency to run, which can ruin the appearance of your fixture. After applying each coat, wait for them to dry before applying any more paint. Keep your application as even as possible. Spray painting over coats that are still wet can lead to paint blistering, which is when the paint rises from its underlying surface. Shake your can often \u2013 every 2 to 3 minutes is recommended for larger pieces. Always wear a paint mask to avoid breathing in fumes. These can be purchased from local home hardware stores."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a tack cloth to pick up any dust and dirt as you paint.",
          "description":"Even after you've cleaned your light fixtures, you'd be surprised how often dirt and dust can return. Keep a tack cloth handy and wipe it across any dusty or dirty surfaces prior to paint application. Purchase tack cloths from the paint department of your local home hardware store."

Home hardware and furniture stores offer many shapes and sizes, so you have plenty of selection to choose from. An even cheaper solution is to use some thumbtacks to cover your light with a piece of fabric. Choose a fabric that is attractive and lets light through. A square piece is ideal, as you can stick a tack into each corner and secure it to your ceiling. Just make sure it's big enough that it hangs low enough to avoiding heating up and posing a fire hazard."

          "description":"Find or purchase a small laundry basket or bin that you would normally use as a shower caddy. Try and find one with a color and design that matches the theme of your home or space. Cut the handles off using a box cutter and then use it to puncture an \"X\" shape in the center of the basket or bin's bottom. Slide the opening over your light fixture and you're good to go! Remove glass domes or panels that get in the way. To add more style to your space, you can cover the basket or bin with a piece of fabric that matches your decor. As another alternative, you can spray paint the basket or bin a matching color."

Use a knife or box cutter to carefully poke a hole into the center and slide it over your light fixture. Spray paint the base circle piece or cover it with electrical tape. Make sure the chopping board you choose will allow light through. If you pick a textured chopping board, it might diffuse too much of the light."

Measure the circumference of your light fixture and select a shade that is big enough to accommodate it. Secure ribbons of varying or identical colors using a glue gun or fabric glue. Most furniture or hardware stores have specific shades designed for various kinds of light fixtures, such as chandeliers. The amount of pieces you cut depends on how you want your shade to look. A maximum of 4 is recommended, but 1, 2, or 3 pieces will also work. Use different colored ribbons if you want a multi-colored design."

Take off the bulbs before you do this, and then screw them back on after. You can also purchase new ones that create a different feel. Electric candle lightbulbs work great for this design and contribute to the chandelier look. Use Edison bulbs in your fixture for a farmhouse or industrial look."

Dab some hot glue onto the bottom of each arm and then begin wrapping them with rope. Apply hot glue to each 1 inch (2.5 cm), and tie the strings off once they reach the top where the bulbs are attached. Select a material that can comfortably be wrapped around your light fixture. Twine will usually stick easier as it's less dense than most rope."

Spray paint it in a color that matches your beads prior to hanging them. Use wooden beads for a more rustic look or acrylic crystal beads for something more classy and eye-popping."
