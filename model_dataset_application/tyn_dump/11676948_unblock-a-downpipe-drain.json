Remove the screws at the top of the downspout connecting it to the gutter. Then unscrew the straps attaching the spout to the house. Lift the spout out of its position at the opening of the downpipe. Depending on how tall the downspout is, you may need a ladder to reach the top. If so, make sure the ladder is on a flat, stable surface and don't stand on the top step to maintain your balance. Remember that sometimes the downspout is clogged, not the downpipe. Look down the spout with a flashlight before removing it to see if there is a blockage in there. If so, spray down with a high-pressure hose to dislodge it."
