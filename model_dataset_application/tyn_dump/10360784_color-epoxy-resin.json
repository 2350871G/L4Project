For best results, purchase a paint or tint designed to bond with resin and bring out particularly saturated colors. A tint is an artificial dye used to change an object\u2019s color.

Follow the instructions on your resin container to determine what is the proper ratio of resin to hardener you should use. Be sure to wear eye protection (e.g., goggles) and rubber gloves to protect your eyes and skin during this procedure.

Use a mixing container that includes volume measurements on the side for easier measuring. For example, a small measuring cup used for dispensing cough syrup would work very well for testing resin colorants."

You can roughly estimate how much to add to make up 2%-6% of the mixture\u2019s weight, or use a digital scale to precisely weigh your colorant and mixture. Avoid going over the 6% weight limit, as adding this much colorant might disrupt the delicate chemical process that takes place in resin and that is necessary for it to be properly used. There is no harm in adding so little colorant that it amounts to less than 2% of the mixture\u2019s weight. However, this may not be enough colorant to produce a different color in your resin. If you\u2019re not sure how much colorant to add, err on the side of adding less than you think you might want. If it isn\u2019t enough, you can always add more."

For example, if you used .25 fluid ounces (7.4 mL) of resin in your mixing cup to test the colorant and your overall amount of resin is 2 fluid ounces (59 mL), then you should multiply the amount of colorant you added to the mixing cup by 8 to determine the amount you should use in the rest of the resin."
