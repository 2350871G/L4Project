For those with a stacked condenser unit, examine the condenser box attached to the top of the furnace. Next, check the bottom right corner of this box to locate the refrigerant lines, which are a pair of thick and thin tubes. When you\u2019re trying to find a leak in an outdoor unit, the filter/dryer tube is the most likely suspect.Tip: All A/C condenser units will have 2 refrigerant lines: a suction line and a liquid line. The suction line is a thicker, wider tube that holds gas. The liquid line is a narrow, thinner tube that transports liquid."
