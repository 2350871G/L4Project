Roast halved plums for 15 to 20 minutes. Poach plums whole for 15 to 25 minutes. Stew sliced and pitted plums for about 10 minutes. Bake plums in pies and crumbles. Poaching Plums Bring the water and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.

You do not need to peel them, but you should discard the pits. Slice the plums into wedges first. After that, you can leave them as is, or cut them further into chunks. Place the plums into a shallow saucepan, and cover them with sugar. You will need 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of sugar for every 1 pound (500 grams) of plums. If the plums are very sweet, or if you don't have that give of a sweet tooth, you might want to use only 2 or 3 teaspoons instead. Add some water.

You can ladle the sauce over the plums, or save it for another recipe. Roasting Plums Preheat your oven to 390\u00b0F (200\u00b0C/gas 6).  Mix the sugar and ground cinnamon together in a bowl. Measure out \u2154 cups (150 grams) of white granulated sugar and \u00bc teaspoon of cinnamon. Put them into a bowl, and mix them briskly together with a fork. Make sure that the cinnamon is distributed evenly throughout the sugar. Beat the egg white in a shallow dish with a whisk. If you have not done so already, crack open an egg over a shallow dish, and separate the yolk from the white. Discard the yolk, or save it for another recipe, then whisk the egg white. You want it to be a little foamy, but not so much that it turns white and stiff. Dip the plums into the egg white, then roll them in the cinnamon sugar. You do not need to peel, cut, or pit the plums first. Simply rinse them, then pat them dry. Roll them in the beaten egg white until they are evenly coated, then roll them in the cinnamon-sugar. Arrange the plums in a buttered baking dish. Choose a baking dish with high walls. The plums will release lots of juices as they bake. Make sure that the dish is big enough to fit the plums comfortably; you don't want to pack them too tightly. Bake the plums for about 15 to 20 minutes. They are ready when they have turned crusty and juicy. You can check if they are cooked through by poking one of them with a toothpick. If the toothpick pieces the plum easily, then the plums are ready! Serve the plums. They taste great with cream, custard, or vanilla ice cream. Grilling Plums Grease your grill with cooking spray, then preheat it to medium-high. You can use an outdoor grill or a stovetop grill for this method. Wash, halve, and pit the plums. Choose some firm plums suitable for cooking. Rinse them with cool water, then pat them dry. Slice them in half, then remove the pits. Mix together the butter, sugar, and cinnamon. If you have not already, melt the butter, either in a small saucepan or in the microwave. Pour it into a small mixing bowl, then add the sugar and ground cinnamon.
