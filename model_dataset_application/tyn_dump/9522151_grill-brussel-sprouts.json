If you don't like using the microwave, you can also blanch the sprouts in a pot of boiling water for 3-5 minutes. The warm brussels sprouts will also soak up more flavorful oil and seasonings."

Cayenne pepper, minced garlic, onion powder, and red pepper flakes are all popular seasonings for jazzing up brussels sprouts and similar veggies. In addition to some of the more common cooking spices, you might also try incorporating sweet and zesty ingredients like honey, dijon mustard, or lemon zest.

Leave at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of space between each to give them a little room to breathe. Once you've loaded the skewer with 4-5 sprouts, start a new one. Orienting all of the sprouts the same way will help them cook more evenly on the grill. It's important that you only use metal skewers for grilling. Wooden skewers will simply burn up when exposed to an open flame."

Spread the skewers out over the grill surface so they'll be easier to turn and remove once they're done cooking. If you situate the skewers so that they're running parallel to the grate, there's a chance they could slip down through the openings as they cook down. Grilling the sprouts directly on the grate results in a bolder flavor than wrapping them in foil or cooking them on one of the upper racks."

Especially large or tough sprouts may require as long as 10 minutes per side to heat through. Exact cooking times may vary, depending on the size, texture, and number of the sprouts. Keep an eye on your brussels sprouts as they grill and use your best judgment to determine when they're done. As the sprouts cook, the coating of oil on the outside will cause them to caramelize, making them nice and crispy."
