      "description":"There are all kinds of ways to prepare flavouring for your shaved ice. Some include melting sugary drinks, chopping up fruit, or even just using a favourite beverage. There are many ways you can prepare flavourings:\n\nUse powdered drink mixes: The key to this type of flavouring is to have it come out very concentrated and very sweet. A simple way to do this is mix 2 cups of sugar and \u00be cup of water in a pan. Heat the mixture to a full boil and remove the pan from the heat. Then add the powdered drink mix like Kool-Aid into the liquid. Cut up fruit: Fruits are great when paired with some sugary liquid like condensed milk, vanilla ice cream, or just plain sugar water. Use soft fruits cut into bite-sized squares like mangos, peaches, strawberries, berries, passion fruit, bananas, and kiwis. Use syrups: You can purchase syrups specifically designed for shaved ice or snow cones. There are variety of flavours that you can drizzle onto your shaved ice. Use beverages: You can simply pour in your favourite pop, juice, or coffee onto your shaved ice."

      "description":"Whether you're using a shaved ice maker or a blender, you'll need to make or buy ice. Fill several ice trays with water, or any other liquid you want your shaved ice to taste like (and that can be frozen), and let them freeze overnight. Or purchase a bag of ice from your local grocery store. Some stores may even sell ice shaved."

      "headline":"Shave your ice.",
      "description":"You can purchase machines that make shaved ice or make your own shaved ice with a sturdy blender or food processor. Create shaved ice with a blender by pressing the \"crush\" button for about a minute. If the mix is too thin, add more ice; if too thick, add more liquid. Crush ice thoroughly, then press blend until it is blended to your desired consistency. If your ice cubes are too large, blend small amounts of ice thoroughly until you've created a powdered like consistency. It may be helpful to get a bag and crush the ice in it with a rolling pin beforehand."

You can also arrange your fruit on top of the ice and pour condensed milk or sugar water over your fruit. Alternatively, you can add your flavouring into the blender or food processor to mix together."
