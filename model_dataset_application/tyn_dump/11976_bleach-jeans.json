Wear thick rubber gloves to avoid irritating your skin from the solution. You may also want to wear safety goggles to avoid getting bleach in your eyes."

If you feel faint, leave the area immediately and call poison control. Keep the product label nearby, if possible, to give information to poison control specialists. Never mix bleach with other household products. Some chemicals, when mixed with bleach, create toxic fumes. Avoid mixing bleach and ammonia, or ammonia and rubbing alcohol."

Try your solution out on your ruined jeans before you apply it to your favorite jeans. You will get a better handle of how bleach lightens jeans and whether your concentration is too strong. Different jean colors may react in unique ways. Choose a ruined pair close to your favorite pair's color for the most accurate idea."

Bleach pens won't create a quite as natural look, but they involve less clean-up and are applied more easily. You can also use a bleach pen to draw intricate designs or words onto your jeans."
