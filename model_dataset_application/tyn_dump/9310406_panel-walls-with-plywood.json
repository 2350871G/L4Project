If you\u2019re just paneling one wall with plywood, you'll only need the length of that wall. Divide the perimeter of the room by the length of the plywood panels you want to use to find out how many panels you'll need. For example, if the perimeter of the room is 24 feet (7.3 meters), and the plywood panels you want to use are 4 feet (1.2 meters) across, you would need six panels. If you\u2019re paneling one wall that\u2019s 15 feet (4.6 meters) long, and the plywood panels you want to use are 4 feet (1.2 meters) across, you would need four plywood panels. Four of the panels would equal 16 feet (4.9 meters), so you\u2019d need to cut 1 foot (0.3 meters) off one of the panels."

Four of the panels would equal 16 feet (4.9 meters), so you\u2019d need to cut 1 foot (0.3 meters) off one of the panels. Acclimate the plywood panels to the room before you get started. This will prevent them from warping once they're up on the walls. Lean the panels along one of the walls in the room you\u2019ll be paneling. Let the panels sit in the room for 24 hours. If you\u2019re paneling a room that\u2019s below ground level, like a basement, let the panels acclimate for 48 hours. Arrange the panels in your desired placement.

Use a saw to cut the plywood panels to size. You want the height of the panels to be the distance between the floor and the ceiling in the room you\u2019ll be paneling. If you\u2019ll be installing ceiling molding, make the panels \u00bc inch (0.6 cm) shorter. Make the cutouts for any outlets. Take a piece of chalk and heavily outline the perimeter around the outlet cover on the wall. Take the piece of plywood that will go over that section of the wall and press it into place. Tap the section of the panel that\u2019s over the outlet so the chalk outline transfers onto the back of the panel. Remove the panel and cut out the chalk perimeter on the plywood with a saw. Make the cutouts for any doors and windows. Mark where the panel that will cover the door or window will begin and end. Measure the distance between the marks and the edges of the door or window. If you\u2019re covering a window, measure how high up the top and bottom of the window are from the floor. If you\u2019re measuring a door, measure how high up the top of the door is from the floor. Use the measurements to draw the shape of the window or door onto the plywood panel. Use a saw to cut out the shape. Prepping the Walls Remove any trim from the walls.

Attaching the Paneling Use a caulking gun to apply panel adhesive to the walls. Start with one section of wall in a corner of the room. Squeeze the handle on the caulking gun so panel adhesive comes out. Smear a quarter-size amount of the panel adhesive onto the wall. Repeat every 10 inches (25.4 cm) up, down, and across the section of the wall where the first plywood panel will go. Only apply the panel adhesive to one section of the wall. Wait until you get the paneling up on that section before you move on to another one. You can find a caulking gun and panel adhesive at your local hardware store. Press the first plywood panel into the adhesive on the wall. The backside of the paneling you want hidden should be facing the wall. Use a rolling pin to firmly press the panel into the adhesive. Hammer 1 \u00bc inch (3.2 cm) finishing nails into the top and bottom of the panel. The nails will ensure the panel stays in place.
