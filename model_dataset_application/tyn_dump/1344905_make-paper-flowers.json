          "description":"A really nice way to get paper flowers with interesting, nuanced petals is to paint on watercolor paper. It allows for slightly different shades within the same piece that look natural and reminiscent of a real flower. For watercolor paper, you simply dip your brush in a bit of clean water, add some watercolor paint to the tips of the brush, and go over the paper. The best part about it is that it\u2019s supposed to look slightly different in every spot, so you don\u2019t have to worry about shading or blending. You can also use cardstock or construction paper, too, and it\u2019s quicker and cheaper. You just won\u2019t have the soft gradient of watercolor paper; however, you could choose a more vivid color with this type instead."

Let\u2019s make three different sizes, then: 1\" (2.5cm) flowers, 2\" (5cm) flowers, and 3\" (7.5cm) flowers. All you need to do is cut squares that are these sizes (in both length and width) and pile them up. Make a whole bunch. Each flower will require at least 12 squares or so. And it\u2019s not that the 1\" squares are in the middle and the 3\" squares are on the outside \u2013 instead, it\u2019s just the amount you roll them up to get them bigger and smaller. A 3\" flower, for example, will be made entirely of 3\" squares."

The more intense your rolling, the more curved they'll be. And then unroll them. When you unroll them, they'll maintain a bit of the curve of the roll.

Since you're still on the second layer of petals, this one, too, will be highly curved and close to the bud. As you expand, the petals should get more and more splayed out. Every layer should peep out from between the layer before. In the valley where the two petals meet in one layer should be the center of the petal from the next layer. And again, with each succeeding layer, your petals should get less and less rolled up. Once your layers reach the size and width that you want, you're done. It's as simple as that! With this technique, they look even better in groups, so don't stop now. Make a few to stick together to make their beauty (and your creativity) exponentially more remarkable."
