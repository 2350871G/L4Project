    "Trim the fabric off with fabric scissors, then overlap the 2 pattern pieces.",
    "Press the tape down to seal the pieces together.How much you peel the backing by and how much you overlap depends on the seam allowances in the pattern.",
    "Usually, this is around \u20442 inch (1.3 cm).",
    "Scrunch your fabric to gather it, then secure it with tape.",
    "Duct tape fabric doesn't behave like regular fabric, so you can't gather it in the same way.",
    "If your pattern calls for gathering, scrunch a 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) length of duct tape fabric, then fold a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide strip of duct tape over the gathered edge to secure it.",
    "Work your way along the top edge until it is gathered.How much you gather the duct tape fabric depends on how long the fabric is to begin with, and how long it needs to be in the end.",
    "Topstitch the seams down, if desired.",
    "You don't have to do this, but it will give your dress a nicer finish.",
    "Turn the dress so that you can see the seams.",
    "Sew down the hems using a straight stitch on your sewing machine and a \u20448 to \u20444 in (0.32 to 0.64 cm) seam allowance.",
    "Use regular scissors to cut off the excess seams as close to the stitching as possible.",
    "If you don't know how to sew, you can cover the seams with \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide strips of duct tape instead.",
    "Hem your dress by folding and taping the raw edges in.",
    "Peel the fabric away from the duct tape by about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm), or however wide you want your hems to be.",
    "Cut the fabric off with fabric scissors, then fold the exposed duct tape down.Alternatively, you can fold 1 in (2.5 cm) wide strips of duct tape over the raw edges.",
    "You can use the same color as the dress, or you can use a different color.",
    "If you know how to sew, you can fold the hems down by about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) towards the fabric side, then sew them down using a straight stitch.",
    "Add the closure recommended by the pattern.",
    "Most dress patterns will have a zipper closure, which will give you the most durable and professional finish.",
    "You will need to sew it in according to the pattern instructions, however.",
    "If you don't know how to sew, you can use self-adhesive Velcro or even eyelets.If you are adding in a zipper, you don't have to fold the raw edges of the fabric down.",
    "Duct tape doesn't fray, after all!",
    "If you want to use a zipper but don't have a sewing machine, you can sew the zipper in by hand using a thread, needle, and straight stitch.",
    "If you choose to use eyelets, be sure to add some laces to close them up.",
    "Shoe laces will give you a cool, punky look that matches the duct tape theme.",
    "Adding Designs Choose a design to add to your dress.",
    "You don't have to add designs, but they are a great way to spruce up a plain-looking dress.",
    "They can be as simple as polka dots to as fancy as flourishes and scrolls.",
    "You can even give your dress a theme, such as Batman, and cut out the Batman logo.",
    "The designs will look the best on plain, solid-colored dresses.",
    "If you used patterned duct tape, you might want to skip the designs, or your dress will look too busy.",
    "Lay down strips of duct tape on a cutting mat.",
    "Decide how big you want your design to be, then tear off a strip of duct tape a little bit longer than that, and lay it sticky-side-down on a cutting mat.",
    "Lay down more strips of duct tape until you have a duct tape sheet a little bigger than your desired design.",
    "Choose duct tape in a contrasting color.",
    "For example, if your dress is black, try white duct tape.",
    "If you want to have multiple small designs, you can make a bigger duct tape sheet in order to fit all of them.",
    "Cut your desired design out of the duct tape with a craft blade.",
    "You can free-hand the design, or you can sketch it out with a pen first.",
    "Carefully trace over your outlines with a craft blade.",
    "If you are working on black duct tape, use a white gel pen so that it shows up.",
    "Use stencils to help trace the design if you don't want to draw.",
    "Peel the design off of the cutting mat like a sticker.",
    "You may need to use your fingernail or the tip of a craft blade to pry the corner of your design up from the cutting mat.",
    "Once you have the corner picked up, carefully peel the design away from the cutting mat, just like you would peel a sticker.",
    "If you made multiple designs, peel just 1 design up for now.",
    "Press the design where you want it to go on your dress.",
    "If you mess up, carefully peel the design up, move it to where you want it to go, and press it down again.",
    "Repeat the process with more designs.",
    "If you cut multiple designs, now is the time to add them on.",
    "Use them to decorate your dress as desired, such as the bodice or skirt."
