This should be 1 to 2 inches below the pot\u2019s rim depending on the size of your seedlings. You also want to make sure you aren't packing the soil. It shouldn\u2019t be loose, but you don't want it compacted or it will be difficult for the roots to continue forming. You can also add rocks to the bottom of your pot to help drain the water. Good drainage is essential for many herbs, such as rosemary and sage. Try to stick to pots between 6\u201d-8\u201d for single plants and 10\u201d and up for multiples. Make sure that your pots have drainage holes."
