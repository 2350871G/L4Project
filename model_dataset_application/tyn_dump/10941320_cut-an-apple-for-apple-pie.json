Discard the thin slice. Removing a thin slice from the end will make it easier to peel since the vegetable peeler will have a way to grab the apple."

Pull the vegetable peeler down to remove a strip of the peel and continue peeling around the entire apple. Discard the peels.Variation: If you prefer, leave the peels on your apples. This will give a firmer texture to the apple pie filling. Try baking the apple peels with a little cinnamon and sugar until they're crisp. Or steep the peels in hot water to make herbal tea."

          "headline":"Cut the apple into 4 pieces to remove the core.",
          "description":"Set the apple cut-side down on your cutting board and carefully use a chef's knife to cut down through the apple right next to the core. Lay the apple down on the side you just cut and make another cut next to the core. Turn the apple to the flat side again and make another cut along the core. Make 1 more cut so that you're left with a square core and 4 large pieces of apple. Although you can use an apple coring tool to remove just the center of the apple, cutting the apple into pieces as you remove the core will give you flat surfaces on which to slice or chop the apple."

Then use a chef's knife to carefully make \u20444 to 1 inch (0.64 to 2.54 cm) thick slices. Repeat this for each piece of the apple.

Apply pressure on both handles as you push straight down. This will cut the apple into 6 to 8 wedges. Keep in mind that most apple cutting tools will remove the cores, so you can begin with a whole, peeled apple if you use the tool."

Adjust the mandoline blade according to the manufacturer's instructions in order to set how thick the apple slices will be. Then rub the apple piece down against the mandoline blade to slice it. Repeat this with the other apple portions. Since the mandoline will slice the apple thinly, make the slices between \u20444 and \u20442 inch (0.64 and 1.27 cm) thick."

This ensures that some of the apples break down while others stay firm during baking.
