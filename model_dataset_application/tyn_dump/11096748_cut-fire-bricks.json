Subtract this from the length of the brick to determine how much you\u2019ll need to cut away. If your brick is 9 in (23 cm) long and you\u2019d like to fit it into a 6 in (15 cm) space, you\u2019ll need to cut off 3 in (7.6 cm). For an angled cut, use a protractor to determine what angle you\u2019ll need to use in order for your brick to fit in place."

If you\u2019ll be hand-cutting the brick, mark the cut lines all around the perimeter of the brick.

This will make the hammering easier and will help reduce the strain on your arms and back. Choose a sturdy, level work surface that can hold up to or absorb shock. A layer of packed sand can help absorb shock as the brick will sink into it when you make your strikes. But make sure the brick sits level atop the sand so that you can make the cleanest possible cut. A wooden workbench may also be suitable, but be aware of the shock transfer. Clear off the surfaces so other items don\u2019t topple over."

Maintain a steady, firm grip on the handle and focus on holding the chisel perfectly upright. Keep your fingers away from the top of the chisel to avoid striking them with the hammer.

Rotate the brick and repeat this process to lightly score all 4 sides. Don\u2019t try to pound down on the brick; just let the hammer\u2019s weight gradually create a dent in the brick with each strike."

If it\u2019s your first time using a hammer and chisel to cut brick, this is a good chance to experiment with how the tools work together and how much impact is necessary to dent the brick. If you mess up the scoring or cutting, it\u2019s ok! Just make sure you have a few spare bricks handy."

          "description":"Hold the hammer higher up above your head, and bring it down directly so it strikes the top of the chisel. The idea is to transfer the full impact of the hammer to the chisel so the brick cracks evenly and cleanly. Just like with golfing, follow through so you finish with a solid strike and transfer all of the pressure to the chisel and brick. If it doesn\u2019t break along the scored lines during your first attempt, make a few more heavy strikes. While this can seem a little daunting if it\u2019s your first time, try to relax your body and build up some confidence. If you\u2019re holding the chisel steadily upright and have scored the brick all the way around, you can feel assured about your preparation to make the final blows successful! You don\u2019t need to pound down on the brick, just let gravity and physics work their magic."
