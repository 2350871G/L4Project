Some plants, such as onions, can handle freezing temperatures after you harden off seedlings. Other plants, such as tomatoes, will suffer if the temperature goes below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 degrees Celsius). Members of the cabbage family can handle cold temperatures but are more likely to bolt, or produce flowers and seeds, if the temperature remains cool for longer than a week. Don't let cabbages sit out in temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 Celsius). Place the seedlings near a wall of your house in the evenings at first, so they will benefit from the warmth of the house. The walls will protect the seedlings from wind."
