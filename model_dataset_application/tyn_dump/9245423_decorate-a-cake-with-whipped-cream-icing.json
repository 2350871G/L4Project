Your whipped cream frosting will come together and hold its shape much easier if your cookware is chilled. If you don't have a metal bowl, it's fine to use plastic. However, it's best to use metal, as metal bowls will help insulate cold whipping cream, which makes for a more stabilized icing. Be sure your bowl is large enough to hold 2 cups of whipped cream without overflowing."

If you're making a double layer cake, and plan on using whipped cream icing to frost in between your layers, double the recipe to guarantee you wont run out of frosting."
