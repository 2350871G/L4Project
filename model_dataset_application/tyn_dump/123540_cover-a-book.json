You can cover your books with foreign or old newspapers, old or new maps, sheet music, old wall paper, a brown paper bag, etc.. Unless you are covering a smaller book, you will need a large piece of paper to make your cover. It will need to be at least double the length of your book and three inches taller than the height of your book."

          "headline":"Cut the paper to size using the measurements for your book.",
          "description":"To find the width of the book, lay the book open and measure the width with a measuring tape or ruler. Then add 6 inches, 3 inches to cover both sides of the book. Next measure the height of the book and add 3 inches, 1 \u00bd inches to cover the top and bottom of the book. Using a ruler, mark a faint line with a pencil on your paper the dimensions of your cover, and then with a sharp pair of scissors, cut your paper to size. Avoid laying the book out so that a previous crease that was in a bag or on your paper aligns with a cover edge. If your paper is already worn, it will tear more easily when it is on an edge of the book."

Faintly mark the edges of the top and bottom of the book then add an extra \u00bc inch so that the book will fit inside of the cover. Take the book off the paper, and fold the paper up to the spot marked and make your fold into a crease. Repeat the process with the top of the book; fold the paper down and create your crease about a 1/4 inch above the top of the book. Go back over the creases you have made in the paper with a pen or bone folder. You want your creases to be crisp and clean, especially if you are using heavy paper."

Press your book down so it does not move, and fold the paper over the right side of the book and create a crease. Go back over the crease, more lightly than before, with the side of your pen or your bone folder. To accommodate for the thickness of the cover, do not make the creases too heavy. With the flap in the right side of the book, close the book and wrap the paper around the book and mark where you want to fold the paper to make the last flap. Take the book of the paper, and crease the flap for the left side of the book. Go over the crease with your bone folder or pen again, but remember to keep the crease lighter."

To secure your notebook in the cover, put your notebook under the rubber band closer to the book opening, and set it on top of the rubber band nearer to the book spine. Making a Fabric Cover Choose one or two fabrics to make your notebook cover with. If you have a sewing machine, making fabric covers is a simple way to cover your notebooks. Pick one fabric for the cover and the another fabric for the flaps on the inside of the cover. You can choose a combination of a print and a solid color fabric, two print fabrics, or two different colored solid fabrics. You should prewash your fabric to prevent it from shrinking. Iron the fabric before you use it as well. You will need less fabric for the inside of the cover and more for the outside. Find the dimensions for the cover.

To get the width, multiply the width of the front cover by two, then add the width of book's spine, and then add another inch. For example, your height and width may be 8 (height)x 12 \u00bd (width of book spread open) inches, and then you would add another inch to have 9 x 13 \u00bd inches. For the dimensions of the inside flaps, use the same cover dimension for the height, for my example it is 9 inches. To find the width, divide the width by 3. In my example, 13 \u00bd  divided by 3 is 4.5 inches. My fabric will measure 9 x 4.5 inches. Cut the fabrics to the dimensions you took. Using a pair of sharp scissors and a ruler, make a faint straight line on your fabric and cut out your fabric to size. You should cut out 2 larger pieces of fabric for the outside and inside and 2 smaller pieces of fabric for the inside flaps. Use an iron to make a double fold. Make a \u00bc inch flap along one of the long sides of the inner fabric, and iron it down so that it is creased. Double the fabric, turning over the folded crease once more so that it has a second \u00bc inch fold over the first fold. Create a crease on this double fold and then iron it down. Do this on both pieces of the flap fabric. Sew the double fold shut. On the inner side of the double fold, use your sewing machine and sew the flap down so that it is closed. At the top and bottom of your fabric back up your sewing machine and go back over the stitches to ensure the stitching does not come undone at the ends. Repeat the process with both pieces of fabric. Layer your fabrics, and pin them into place. Lay out a piece of the bigger fabric with the print or color side facing up. Then place the smaller fabric flaps on top of the bigger fabric so that they are covering the right and left sides of the bigger fabric. The sewn sides of the flap fabrics should be facing in toward the center of the big fabric. Then place the last piece of big fabric on top of the three pieces of fabric with the print or color side facing down. Pin the 4 fabric sheets together. To keep the fabric in place while you sew, pin about four pins on the bottom and top of the fabric and the three pins on the sides of the fabric. Sew around the edges of your cover using a \u215c inch inseam. Leave a gap of an \u00be inch in the middle of the bottom or top of the cover so that you can turn the cover inside out once you have finished sewing. Use your scissors to round the corners of the fabric, and then turn the cover inside out. To round the corners, trim the sharp edges of the 4 corner edges off. Then flip the cover inside out. Make sure to get all of the corners all the way turned out. Iron the cover, and then sew a perimeter around the sides of the cover. Iron the cover to flatten it, and then use your sewing machine to go back over the 4 sides of the cover. You can use a 3/8 inch inseam. This perimeter will close the \u00be inch gap you left, and give the cover a clean and finished style.",

    "For example, your height and width may be 8 (height)x 12 \u00bd (width of book spread open) inches, and then you would add another inch to have 9 x 13 \u00bd inches.",
    "For the dimensions of the inside flaps, use the same cover dimension for the height, for my example it is 9 inches.",
    "To find the width, divide the width by 3.",
    "In my example, 13 \u00bd  divided by 3 is 4.5 inches.",
    "My fabric will measure 9 x 4.5 inches.",
    "Cut the fabrics to the dimensions you took.",
    "Using a pair of sharp scissors and a ruler, make a faint straight line on your fabric and cut out your fabric to size.",
    "You should cut out 2 larger pieces of fabric for the outside and inside and 2 smaller pieces of fabric for the inside flaps.",
    "Use an iron to make a double fold.",
    "Make a \u00bc inch flap along one of the long sides of the inner fabric, and iron it down so that it is creased.",
    "Double the fabric, turning over the folded crease once more so that it has a second \u00bc inch fold over the first fold.",
    "Create a crease on this double fold and then iron it down.",
    "Do this on both pieces of the flap fabric.",
    "Sew the double fold shut.",
    "On the inner side of the double fold, use your sewing machine and sew the flap down so that it is closed.",
    "At the top and bottom of your fabric back up your sewing machine and go back over the stitches to ensure the stitching does not come undone at the ends.",
    "Repeat the process with both pieces of fabric.",
    "Layer your fabrics, and pin them into place.",
    "Lay out a piece of the bigger fabric with the print or color side facing up.",
    "Then place the smaller fabric flaps on top of the bigger fabric so that they are covering the right and left sides of the bigger fabric.",
    "The sewn sides of the flap fabrics should be facing in toward the center of the big fabric.",
    "Then place the last piece of big fabric on top of the three pieces of fabric with the print or color side facing down.",
    "Pin the 4 fabric sheets together.",
    "To keep the fabric in place while you sew, pin about four pins on the bottom and top of the fabric and the three pins on the sides of the fabric.",
    "Sew around the edges of your cover using a \u215c inch inseam.",
    "Leave a gap of an \u00be inch in the middle of the bottom or top of the cover so that you can turn the cover inside out once you have finished sewing.",
    "Use your scissors to round the corners of the fabric, and then turn the cover inside out.",
    "To round the corners, trim the sharp edges of the 4 corner edges off.",
    "Then flip the cover inside out.",
    "Make sure to get all of the corners all the way turned out.",
    "Iron the cover, and then sew a perimeter around the sides of the cover.",
    "Iron the cover to flatten it, and then use your sewing machine to go back over the 4 sides of the cover.",
    "You can use a 3/8 inch inseam.",
    "This perimeter will close the \u00be inch gap you left, and give the cover a clean and finished style."
