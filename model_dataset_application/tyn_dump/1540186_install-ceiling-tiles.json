Then divide the square footage of the ceiling by the square footage of one tile. This will tell you how many tiles you'll need. For example, if your tile is 24\" long and 24\" wide (2' by 2'), then the square footage for the tile is 4 (2 multiplied by 2). If the square footage for your room is 180, divide it by 4. You'll need at least 45 tiles. Always buy 15 percent more tiles than you think you'll need. That way, if you need to cut tiles or make a mistake, you'll have plenty to complete the job."

This is also a good time to give fixtures and vents a quick clean. Installing Tiles Directly on the Ceiling Use chalk lines to find the center of the room. Measure halfway across each wall in opposite directions, using the length and width measurements you made for the ceiling. Have someone hold the chalk line or reel while you walk to the opposite end of the room. Snap the chalk against the ceiling. Rotate 90 degrees and do the same for the two opposite walls.

A joist is a length of timber or metal that provides structural support. It's easiest to use a stud finder to locate them in the ceiling. Mark the spot with a nail or chalk mark. You might want to start by checking for joists near lighting fixtures since they're often installed along joists. Find the other joists.
