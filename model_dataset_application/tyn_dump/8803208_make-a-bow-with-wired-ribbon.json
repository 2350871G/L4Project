  "text":" Making a Basic Bow Cut a length of ribbon. How long the ribbon is depends on how big you want the bow to be. The wider the ribbon is, the more ribbon you will need to cut. This method will create something that looks like the standard bow you'd use to tie shoe laces with. Make two loops in your ribbon. Find the center of your length of ribbon first, then make a loop to each side of that point. Make sure that both loops are pointing upward. Cross the loops over and under each other. Gently tug on the loops to tighten the knot. This is just like when you are tying your shoes. Gently adjust the length of the tails and the loops. Pull the loops or tails one at a time until you get the length you want them to be. Stop when the loops are the right length for you, then tug on them both at the same time to tighten the knot. Don't worry if the tails are too long. Straighten the knot, if needed. If you have a very wide ribbon, the knot in the middle may be wrinkled. Slip your forefingers under each side of the knot on the front of the ribbon. Straighten out the side edges of the knot. Shape the ribbons and trim the tails. Use your fingers to fluff up the loops to you liking. The wires inside the ribbons will help the loops keep their shape. If you need to, use a pair of scissors to trim the ribbon tails down.

Wrap the tail ribbon around the middle of the bow. Place the knotted part of the tail ribbon over the center of your bow.
