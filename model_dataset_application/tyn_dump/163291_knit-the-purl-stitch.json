This will make a reversible pattern that has ribs on both sides of the fabric. For a double rib, knit 2 and purl 2 for every row. This will create a slightly wider rib.

Cast on as many stitches as you like and knit every stitch on your first row. Turn the work and purl every stitch of the following row. Keep alternating the rows so your fabric has a bumpy side and a smooth side.Tip: Keep in mind that stockinette tends to curl along the edges, so you may want to block the fabric or add a border so your fabric lies flat. The smooth side will show the knit stitches while the bumpy side shows the purled stitches. The stockinette stitch is referred to as \"St st\" in most patterns."
