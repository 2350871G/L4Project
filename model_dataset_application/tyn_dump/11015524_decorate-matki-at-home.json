          "description":"It is important to wait for the paint to dry; otherwise, you risk it smudging. Place the matki jar on a flat surface away from pets and children, so that it won't get knocked over. If the paint is still sticky to touch after 24 hours, leave it to dry for another 12 hours."

Consider painting a line of dots right around the top of the jar for a traditional look or painting random dots for a modern look. Experiment with different sized dots to create contrast in your design. If you don't feel confident drawing freehand, draw the designs in pencil first or use a stencil."

Consider painting multiple squiggly lines around the middle of the jar or painting a straight line around the top or bottom of the jar. Be creative and combine the different elements to create a unique look. Instead of painting lines right around the jar, consider painting small squiggly lines randomly over the jar for a fun, playful look."

Gold and red would look eye-catching over a navy base coat. If you don't have all the colours that you want, try mixing your paints to create new colours. For example, blue and yellow make green and red and blue make purple."

Then, carefully place the decoration on top of the glue and wait for it to dry. Super glue generally takes about 15 minutes to completely dry. This is a great option if you want to use your matki jars at a wedding or if you want to use them as decorations. Purchase decorations from a craft store or dollar store.

Then, liberally sprinkle glitter over the glue and wait 12 hours for it to dry. Once the glue is dry, lightly shake the pot to remove any excess glitter. School glue is also known as PVA glue. A thick line of gold glitter around the bottom of the matki jar is a popular design. Alternatively, spread the glue in a circle shape and then sprinkle the glitter over."

If you are wanting an intricate look, consider adding multiple ribbons. Experiment with different width ribbons to create different looks. Ribbons are most popularly tied around the top of the jar. To add extra colour to your jar, opt for a bright, multi-coloured ribbon."

Press down on the laces to make them flat and cut off any extra material, if necessary. To create a pattern, layer multiple laces underneath each other.

This is a great way to make your jar look more colourful and playful. Consider placing the tassels or pom poms in a pattern.
