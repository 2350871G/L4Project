          "description":"Putty knives come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes, but choosing the best one for the job doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelming. Between flat and angled blades, flat ones are better at spreading material. Also, select a flexible blade instead of a stiff one. The blade can either be plastic or steel, depending on your preference. Plastic knives are inexpensive, but they are also weaker and more disposable than metal ones. If you\u2019re planning on using the knife often, get a stainless steel one instead. For most projects, a 3 in (7.6 cm) blade works well. You could use a 4 in (10 cm) blade to fill in bigger areas or switch to a smaller blade to fill smaller holes."

Try to get enough putty to cover the gap you plan on filling. If you use too much, you can always scrape off the excess putty afterward. Note that many products, including wall putty, have to be mixed with water before they can be applied. Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions about how much water to use. Dry products that don\u2019t have to be mixed, such as window glazes, can often be applied by hand. Set it where you need to spread it instead of trying to pick it up with a knife."

Bring the handle down toward you so the coated edge is easy to move down the wall. If you\u2019re working on a gap larger than a nail hole, spread putty around its edges first.

Continue moving the knife from top to bottom over the uncovered portions of the surface. Any holes in the surface will be about half-full with putty, and it\u2019s okay if any of them are still visible. If you used too little putty earlier, scoop up a little extra and apply it above the hole. Make sure you use a little bit at a time to keep the layer of putty consistent. Before beginning, spread some of the putty along the top edge of the area by moving the knife from right to left. This will help you distribute the putty more evenly while you\u2019re moving the knife down the wall.
