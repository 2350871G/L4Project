Starting Your Project Gather your supplies. Before you start putting stones on the wall, set out everything you\u2019ll need and cover the floor or counter with a plastic or canvas drop cloth. This prevents a mess in case you drop adhesive. The main supplies you\u2019ll need are the AirStones, the adhesive, a putty knife, and a hacksaw. It can be useful to take all of the stones out of the box at this point. Lay the stones out and look at the variety. A primary feature of AirStone is the range of colors and sizes which create a natural look of variation. Lay the stones out and group them by size or color so that as you apply them to the wall you can pick from the piles. Purposefully randomizing the stones gives the most desirable look. This will add time to your process and it isn\u2019t vital, but it is a helpful way to get the best look. Make a template.

If the section you are covering includes a corner, always place a corner piece to start the row of stones. This keeps you from getting to the corner with too little room to hang a piece. Start with a corner piece for each row. Spread adhesive on the back of the stone. Take your putty knife and scoop up some adhesive from the bucket.
