Ideally, you should put them on over rubber gloves or glove liners to protect yourself from electricity, in case the power is turned back on while you are working. Safety glasses will protect your eyes from glass shards, and are especially important if the light fixture is on the ceiling. If the light fixture is on the ceiling, a hat in addition to the safety glasses will keep broken glass out of your hair. Even though you will be removing the power to the light fixture, there is a small chance the fixture is still charged due to faulty wiring.
