    "You can make a longer flap by working more rows, such as 18 rows for a 7 in (18 cm) long flap.",
    "Cut and tie off the yarn when you finish the flap.",

    "Once you have threaded the braid all the way through the opening, you can use the braid to close the bag.",
    "Tug the ends of the braid until the opening cinches together, then tie the ends of the braid together to keep it closed.",
    "You can tie the braid in a bow to secure it or tie a loose knot.",
    "Sew a button onto the bag to help secure the flap if desired.",
    "If you\u2019d like a way to keep the flap down when your bag is closed, try sewing a button onto the front center of the bag near the opening.",
    "Choose a button that is small enough to fit through a stitch, but large enough that it won\u2019t slip right back out.",
    "Thread a needle with 24 in (61 cm) of yarn, pull until the ends are even, and then tie them in a double knot.",

    "Then, sew the straps onto the backside of the bag using a yarn needle.",
    "To sew canvas straps onto the bag, cut the straps so they are each about 21 in (53 cm) long.",
