          "description":"Whenever you work with a sprayable substance, set up your workspace in a clean, well-ventilated area. After slipping on a safety mask or other specialized gas mask, check that your mouth and nose are fully covered and protected. Since you\u2019re working with a sprayable product, you don\u2019t want to accidentally inhale any rubber coating. While you don\u2019t have to wear gloves, you can slip some on as a safety precaution."

          "description":"Cut or rip away several sections of painter\u2019s tape, then arrange these pieces in a square or rectangular shape around a surface you\u2019d like to protect and recolor. If you\u2019re painting a larger surface, like the hood of a car, tape drop cloths or plastic sheeting around the designated area. For instance, if you\u2019re repainting the silver emblem on the side of your car, place strips of tape a few inches or centimeters away from each side of the emblem. Next, cover the nearby car doors and windows by taping sheeting and/or drop cloths into place. If you\u2019re painting over a large surface, don\u2019t worry about masking off specific areas."

If you don\u2019t shake the can before spraying the Plasti Dip, you might end up with a lumpy, inconsistent application. Ideally, try shaking your can throughout the painting process, like between different coats. This will keep your Plasti Dip smooth."

Work in slow, overlapping, horizontal strokes that cover the entire surface that you\u2019re trying to cover. Don\u2019t worry if the surface\u2019s original color is still visible, as this first coat helps the Plasti Dip bond to the metal.

    "Remove the item slowly from the can.",
    "Don\u2019t leave the item in the coating for an extended period of time; instead, gradually pull it out of the can.",
    "Once again, count to 5 in your head while removing a 1 in (2.5 cm) section from the rubber mixture.",
    "Continue pulling on the end of the wire until the object is completely out of the can.",
    "The dipping and removing processes should take the same amount of time to complete.",
    "Wait 30 minutes for the Plasti Dip to dry completely.",
    "Twist the loose end of wire along a thin railing or some other space with lots of open air.",
    "Leave the newly coated item alone for 30 minutes, so the rubber product can seal and adhere properly.",
    "Whenever you add a new coat of Plasti Dip, always let the item dry.",
    "If you\u2019re working outside, consider tying your item to the handle of a walk-behind lawnmower.",
    "Apply 2-3 coats to finish coating your project.",
    "After the initial coat of Plasti Dip dries, submerge your item back into the can of coating.",
    "Repeat the same process as you did before, and use gradual motions to lower and raise your object in the rubber coating.",
    "After each new coat, use the wire to hang up your item in an open area so it can dry completely.",
    "Since the dipping method is used for smaller objects, you don\u2019t need to worry as much about the drying time between coats.",
    "Brushing on Plasti Dip Lay plastic sheeting down to protect your workspace.",
    "Arrange a large section of plastic sheeting over a table or other flat area where you plan on working.",
    "Once this sheeting is in place, arrange your other supplies, like the Plasti Dip can, plastic tray, paint roller, and the object you\u2019d like to paint over.",
    "This method is good for painting car accessories, like your splash guards.",
    "If you want to take extra steps to protect your skin, consider wearing work gloves.Warning: Whenever you work with paint or a paint-like substance, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area.",
    "Keep your windows open, and have a fan blowing air out of the room.",
    "Stir the can of Plasti Dip with a paint stirrer.",
    "Open up the can of rubber coating and place a long, thin item inside, like a paint stirrer.",
    "Using slow, gradual motions, stir the rubber coating in a slow circle, working to make the substance as smooth as possible.",
    "Don\u2019t mix the Plasti Dip too quickly, or the product could spill over the edge and make a mess.",
    "Pour a small amount of Plasti Dip into a plastic container.",
    "Fill up your plastic paint tray with less than 1 cm (0.39 in) of Plasti Dip.",
    "Don\u2019t pour in too much at first, as you can always refill the tray later on.",
    "The brushing method works best on smaller objects, so your paint tray and roller don\u2019t need to be very large.",
    "Dip a short-haired roller into the container.",
    "Place your paint roller into the tray and push it forward.",
    "Roll the tool back and forth, until the roller is completely covered in Plasti Dip.",
    "Try to paint with the roller completely coated, or else the paint job won\u2019t look very smooth.",
    "Whenever you run out of Plasti Dip on your painting tool, dip and roll it in the plastic tray.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a roller on hand, you can also use a paint brush.",
    "Paint over your item with long, even strokes.",
    "Focus on making your coating look as consistent as possible.",
    "As you work, try guiding the paint in smooth, fluid directions, so no roller marks are obvious on the item.",
    "If you\u2019re using a brush, try painting in 1 direction.",
    "This will prevent any obvious brush marks from showing up.",
    "Wait 30 minutes so the first coat can dry.",
    "Leave your item on your workspace, then step away for about half an hour.",
    "Give the rubber coating time to seal to the object\u2019s surface, so the paint job will last longer.",
    "Keep in mind that if you\u2019re coating both sides of an item, you might need to let the 1 side of the item dry before flipping and painting over the opposite edge.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to lose track of time, try setting a timer.",
    "Add 2-3 extra coats of paint to ensure even coverage.",
    "Repeat the brushing process as you apply multiple layers of product to your item of choice.",
    "Like you did before, wait 30 minutes before painting on any additional coats.",
    "If you\u2019re painting both sides of an item, expect the painting, drying, and flipping process to take longer than it would to paint just 1 side.",
    "Don\u2019t use the item for at least 4 hours.",
    "Keep the painted item in an area with lots of open air.",
    "Next, step away from your workspace for at least 4 hours, so the rubber coating can completely seal and harden.",
    "When enough time has passed, feel free to use your newly coated items as you see fit!"
