Apply pressure on the shackle, which is the curved handle at the top of the padlock. Turn the dial clockwise (CW) slowly as you press the shackle. If you can't turn the dial at all from the zero point, release the shackle and turn the dial CW just a number or 2 and then try it again. Find the first sticking point. As you turn the dial CW with tension on the shackle, you will come to the first clockwise stopping point where you can't turn the dial anymore. Make note of where it stops.

Turn the dial clockwise about one number higher from the first sticking point in order to allow you to \"escape\" that sticking point. Reapply tension to the shackle and continue turning the dial clockwise to find the rest of the sticking points. You should find 11 more sticking points, for a total of 12 sticking points in one complete turn of the dial. Write all 12 sticking points down. Find the third number of the combination. Look at your list of sticking points and eliminate all those which are not whole numbers (that is, cross off any number that ends in 0.5). You should eliminate 7 of the 12 numbers with this step. Of the remaining sticking points, choose the number with the unique digit in the \"1s\" position.

For the example above, the numbers would be 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, and 39. One of these numbers is the first number of the combination. (Note: For some 800XXX locks, this will be the second number of the combination. The next set of numbers will be used as the first) Find the possible second numbers of the combination.

One of these numbers is the second number in the combination. Cross out the numbers plus or minus 2 from the third number of the combination. In this example, since 27 is the third number, you can cross 25 and 29 off your list of possible second numbers. Figure out the correct combination by trial and error. You now know all the possible first numbers (3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39), all the possible second numbers (1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 33, 37), and the third number (27).

You only have to clear the lock when the first or third number exceeds the second for the first time. So we would try 27-1-27, then rotate CW to 5 and CCW to 27, then CW to 9 and CCW to 27, then CW to 13 and CCW to 27, then CW to 17 and CCW to 27, then CW to 21 and CCW to 27, *now that the next number we would try is 33 which is greater than our first digit we would try 27-33-27, then CW to 37 and CCW to 27.
