For example, if you are working an item in single crochet, work single crochet decreases. If you are working in double crochet, work double crochet decreases. Crochet 2 together for most of your decreases. Crocheting 2 together will be less noticeable than crocheting 3 together, so opt for crocheting 2 together most of the time and only use crochet 3 together decreases sparingly.
