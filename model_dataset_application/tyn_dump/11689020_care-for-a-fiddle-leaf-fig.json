For the rest of the day, place the plant in an area that\u2019s well-lit, either by natural sunlight or artificial lights. This is important so that the plant will get plenty of indirect light. If the plant\u2019s leaves look pale, spotty, or dull after 2-3 weeks in its current location, move it to a brighter spot. This means that the plant is not getting enough sunlight."
