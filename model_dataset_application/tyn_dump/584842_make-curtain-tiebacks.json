If you'd like to make larger tiebacks, try 9 by 30 inches (22.86 by 76.2 centimeters) instead. Fold the fabric strip in half lengthwise with the right sides facing inward. Press the strip flat with an iron, using a heat setting that is suitable for the fabric you are working with. Sew along two of the edges, using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Sew along the long edge and one of the narrow edges. Leave the other narrow edge open so that you can turn the curtain tieback inside out. Turn the curtain tieback inside out. Use a chopstick, knitting needle, or some other blunt tool to push the curtain tieback inside out. To reduce bulk and prevent bunching, snip the corners of the seams first, just be careful not to cut through the stitching. Tuck the raw edge in, then press the entire tieback flat with an iron. If the raw edge won't stay tucked inside the tieback, secure it with pins. Topstitch all the way around the tieback, \u00bc-inch (0.64centimeter) away from the edge. Use a color that matches your fabric; you can also use a contrasting color if you'd like something more interesting. Be sure to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing a few times to prevent unraveling. Hand sew a small, plastic or metal ring to the top left and top right corners of your tieback. Make sure that the rings are big enough to fit over the wall hooks. If you don't have any wall hooks, you'll want to mount some to either side of your curtain. The hooks should be the same color as your wall so that they blend in. Decorate the curtain tiebacks, if desired. Find a pretty silk or fabric flower that matches your curtain, and hot glue it to the front corner of your tieback. You can also get several flowers, and attach them to the tieback with snaps. This way, you can change out flowers as the seasons change. Use the curtain tiebacks. Hook the tieback onto the wall hook. Pull the curtain towards the wall, then wrap the tieback around it.

    "Pick a color that contrasts with your curtains.",
    "If your curtains have a pattern on them, match the color either to the background or to the pattern.",
    "For a rustic theme, use jute twine.",
    "Start wrapping the ribbon around the ring.",
    "Overlap the ribbon with each turn, so that you don't get any gaps.",
    "Secure the end of the ribbon to the back of the ring with hot glue or fabric glue.",
    "Once you are back where you started, cut off the excess ribbon with a pair of scissors, then glue the end down to the back of the ring.",
    "Decorate the ring, if desired.",
    "Your ring will have a top, bottom, left, and right side.",
    "You can only decorate the top and bottom.",
    "If you decorate the left and right sides, you won't be able to slide the pin through it.",
    "Use hot glue or fabric glue to attach your decorations.",
    "Pearl beads, silk flowers, and ribbon flowers are great choices!",
    "Make sure that the decorations match the color of your ring or the color/theme of your curtain.",
    "For a rustic theme, use flat-backed seashells, sand dollars, and starfish.",

    "Choose a color that is the same color as your ring, or a contrasting one.",
    "Try to cover both ends of the chopstick with ribbon as well to conceal any raw wood.",
    "Decorate the top, wider part of the pin, if desired.",
    "Choose smaller versions of the decorations you used on your ring, and glue them to the top of the pin using hot glue or fabric glue.",
    "You don't need to decorate all the way around the pin; just the front will be enough.",
    "Don't decorate more than 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters), or the pin won't be able to go through the curtain.",
    "If you weren't able to cover both ends of the chopstick with ribbon, you can hide the raw wood with a dab or paint or nail polish.",
    "Choose a color that matches your ribbon, then let it dry.",
