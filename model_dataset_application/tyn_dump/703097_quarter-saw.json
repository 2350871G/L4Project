The \u201cray flecks\u201d that are visible in quarter-sawn wood are the tree\u2019s medullary rays, a type of structure that grows in the wood perpendicular to the growth rings. These structures help transport water and nutrients throughout the tree during life. Quarter-sawn oak is particularly effective for cabinet and furniture making. Oak is also valued for its exceptional stability and resistance to warping. Due to its hardness and fine grain, quarter-sawn maple is ideal for making instruments, decorative boxes, and other fine woodworking projects. The finished wood has a beautiful rippled appearance."

You can also hand-peel the bark from the log. Make sure you are wearing safety gloves. Grip a piece of loose bark from one end of the open face of the log, then pull it up and off the log. Repeat this process using other loose pieces of bark until it\u2019s all been pulled off. If some of the bark is hard to peel off, slide a knife blade or 5-in-1 painter\u2019s tool between the bark and the sapwood to loosen it. It\u2019s easiest to hand-peel bark from logs that have been dead for a year or 2, since this will give the wood and bark plenty of time to dry out."

For example, white maple sapwood is much more desirable than the hardwood and is ideal for making flooring, instruments, and athletic equipment (such as baseball bats). If you want to use sapwood, treat it with wood-preserving chemicals to extend its lifespan. Sapwood is also harder to seal than the heartwood, because it has a lot more moisture in it."
