Leave a small portion that is just big enough for you to hold. This will make it easier for you to slice the beets, if you decide to do that. Consider saving your beet greens. The greens can be cooked separately and can be saut\u00e9ed, roasted, or steamed as well. It won't take nearly as long to cook the greens as it would to cook the beets (just 4 minutes in a steamer will do for the greens), so you'll still have to separate them from the beet, even if you do plan on eating them."

  "text":" Steps Choose the freshest beets. If you want to choose the freshest, tastiest beets, then you should choose beets that are nice and firm. If they're spongy, that means they're older and won't taste as delicious. Fresh beets will also have dark green leafy tops; beets that are past their prime will have tops with a yellow coloring. Remove the beet leaves. Slice the leaves off using a sharp knife. The leaves should be sliced close to the tip of the beet, but not completely removed. Leave a small portion that is just big enough for you to hold. This will make it easier for you to slice the beets, if you decide to do that. Consider saving your beet greens.

Clean the beets. Wash them under running water, scrubbing them thoroughly with a vegetable brush until you no longer see any visible dirt. You can also just use your hands, but you have to be thorough about it. Roasting Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF (204\u00baC).  Prepare your baking sheet. Find a shallow baking sheet that is suitable for roasting your beets. Covering the baking sheet with aluminum foil is not necessary to prevent the beets from sticking, but beet juice may leak out, and a lining could make cleaning up easier when all is said and done. Wrap the beets in aluminum foil. Make sure that the beets are still moist from being washed. If they have dried, rinse them once more to slightly moisten to exterior.

Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the beets before cooking them. Cut the beets into matchstick-size strips. The strips should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. Wider strips will be easier to fry without burning, but they may take a little longer to cook through. Dust the strips with cornstarch. Put 1/4 cup (60 ml) cornstarch in a metal or dark bowl. Avoid plastic bowls, since the raw beet juice is more likely to stain plastic. Add the beet strips to the bowl and gently toss them in the cornstarch using a fork until they are lightly coated. Heat vegetable oil in a medium stockpot. You will need about 4 inches (10 cm) of oil. Attach an instant-read candy thermometer on the side of the pot and continue heating the oil until it reaches 340 degrees Fahrenheit (171 degrees Celsius). Add the beet strips to the hot oil. Cook the beets in batches, adding no more than a handful of the strips into the oil at a time.

Steaming Fill the bottom of a steamer with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Steaming beets is a great way to cook them while allowing them to retain their flavor. Bring the water to a boil.  Arrange the beets in a steamer. Arrange the beets in a single layer so that they are evenly cooked. Cover the steamer once you've placed the beets in it. Cook them for 45 minutes or until they're tender. If you peel and quarter your beets in advance, then you can cook them in half the time. Remove the beets from heat.

    "Peel the skin.",
    "Gently rub the skin with a paper towel until it flakes off.",
    "If the skin does not flake off, use a vegetable peeler to gently peel the top layer of skin away.",
    "This may also mean that you should cook them for another minute so they become more tender.",
    "Serve.",
    "These microwaved beets are ready to be enjoyed on their own, in a salad, or in another recipe of your choice.",
    "You can enjoy them quartered, whole, or sliced.",
    "Frying Peel the beets.",
    "Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the beets before cooking them.",
    "Cut the beets into matchstick-size strips.",
    "The strips should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick.",
    "Wider strips will be easier to fry without burning, but they may take a little longer to cook through.",
    "Dust the strips with cornstarch.",
    "Put 1/4 cup (60 ml) cornstarch in a metal or dark bowl.",
    "Avoid plastic bowls, since the raw beet juice is more likely to stain plastic.",
    "Add the beet strips to the bowl and gently toss them in the cornstarch using a fork until they are lightly coated.",
    "Heat vegetable oil in a medium stockpot.",
    "You will need about 4 inches (10 cm) of oil.",
    "Attach an instant-read candy thermometer on the side of the pot and continue heating the oil until it reaches 340 degrees Fahrenheit (171 degrees Celsius).",
    "Add the beet strips to the hot oil.",
    "Cook the beets in batches, adding no more than a handful of the strips into the oil at a time.",
    "Fry the beets until they are crisp and lightly browned outside but tender inside, about three to five minutes.",
    "Remove and drain the beets.",
    "Use a heat-resistant slotted spoon to remove the beets and drain the oil by placing them on plates lined with paper towels.",
    "Allow the beets to cool before serving.",
    "Serve.",
    "Enjoy these beets on their own, in a salad, or even use them to make borscht, a traditional Ukrainian beet soup.",
    "Boiling Place the beets in a large pot.",
    "Boiling is a great way to cook vegetables as thoroughly and as quickly as possible.",
    "The downside is that, when you boil the beets instead of steaming them or using another method, they may not retain as much of their rich flavor.",
    "Cover them with cold water.",
    "Add sugar and salt as needed.",
    "You should add about 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of salt for every half gallon of water.",
    "Boil the water over high heat.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium once the water boils.",
    "This should keep the water at a nice simmer.",
    "Cook the beets for 45-60 minutes until they're done.",
    "Younger, fresher beets will take less time, closer to 45 minutes, to boil.",
    "Older beets can take an hour or more to cook through boiling.",
    "If you peel and quarter your beets in advance, you can boil them in half the time.",
    "Remove them from the heat.",
    "Once they have finished boiling, you should drain the water and then quickly place the beets into cold water.",
    "Then, cut off the tips of the roots and rub off the skins with a damp towel or paper towel.",
    "Serve.",
    "You can slice or mash these beets and serve them as they are or drizzle them with olive oil and season them with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Steaming Fill the bottom of a steamer with 2 inches (5 cm) of water.",
    "Steaming beets is a great way to cook them while allowing them to retain their flavor.",
    "Bring the water to a boil.",
    "Arrange the beets in a steamer.",
    "Arrange the beets in a single layer so that they are evenly cooked.",
    "Cover the steamer once you've placed the beets in it.",
    "Cook them for 45 minutes or until they're tender.",
    "If you peel and quarter your beets in advance, then you can cook them in half the time.",
    "Remove the beets from heat.",
    "Then, quickly place them in cold water and remove the skins with a paper towel or a damp cloth.",
    "Serve.",
    "Enjoy these beets as they are or slice them, quarter them, or add some olive oil and salt and pepper to them to give them a richer flavor."
