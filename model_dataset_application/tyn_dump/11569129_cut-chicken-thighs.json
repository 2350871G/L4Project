Cover the thigh with a paper towel and apply light and even pressure to wick up the excess liquid. Continue drying the chicken until it doesn\u2019t feel slippery. Drying the thigh will help keep it from sliding around while you\u2019re trying to cut it. If the raw chicken feels sticky, has a potent odor, or looks a dull grey color, throw it away since it has gone bad."

          "description":"Use a filet knife with a long, narrow blade so you can easily cut along the bones without damaging the meat. Set the chicken on a cutting board with the skin facing up, and bend the drumstick back from the thigh until you can see a white line of fat in line with the joint. Slice right along the fat line with your knife to easily separate the thigh and drumstick. Chicken thighs that are sold as \u201cquarters\u201d have the drumsticks still attached. If you hit bone when you cut into the meat, move your knife over and try again until it glides cleanly through the joint. Be sure to use a sharp knife since you\u2019re more likely to hurt yourself with a dull blade."

Place the tip of your knife against the left side of the bone and make slow, short cuts down its length to separate the meat. Try to keep the blade as close to the bone as you can so you don\u2019t accidentally leave behind scraps of meat. Don\u2019t apply too much pressure while you\u2019re cutting, or else the blade may slip off of the bone and cut you.

Pat the meat so it stays in place before placing the tip of your knife along the uncut side of the bone. Use short, slow strokes with the blade angled toward the bone so you remove the most meat.

Raise the bone up to pull the meat tight, and scrape the blade against the length to finish cutting off of the meat. When you reach the end of the bone, cut any places where it\u2019s still attached to the meat to remove it. Never cut toward your fingers since you could easily hurt yourself if the blade slips. Save the bones if you want to make a chicken stock.Tip: Practice deboning multiple thighs at the same time so you can get more practice. Wrap any thighs you don\u2019t want to cook in aluminum foil and store them in your freezer for up to 9 months."
