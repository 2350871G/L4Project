Since you\u2019re making enough beets to fill several jars, you could try slicing the beets several different ways to see which you like best. Simmering the Pickling Liquid Put your pickling spice into a cheesecloth and tie it off. You can buy pickling spice and a cheesecloth from your local grocery store. Put 2 tablespoons (12 grams) of pickling spice into the center of the cheesecloth, and twist and knot the excess fabric to seal the spice into the cloth. Pickling spice is made up of a mixture of mustard seeds, allspice, coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, cloves, ground ginger, cinnamon, and bay leaf. Combine the vinegar, sugar, water, salt, and cheesecloth in a large pot.
