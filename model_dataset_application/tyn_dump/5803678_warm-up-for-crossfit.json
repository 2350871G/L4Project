Then, put your left foot outside of the second box, and then the right. Continue moving your feet inside then outside of the boxes until you reach the end.

Ask your CrossFit coach for instructions or look online to find targeted exercises. If you do get injured, visit a doctor or a physical therapist before returning to CrossFit.
