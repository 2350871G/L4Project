This makes it easier to build and design your wall since you have spatial restrictions. Look for a location in your home where you have enough space to maneuver and climb off the ground. Consult with a contractor to make sure the existing structure can support the weight of your climbing wall while you or others are on it. A common place to build a climbing wall is in a garage, but account for any storage space you need or space to park your car.

A free-standing wall is best if you want to transport it or if you\u2019re renting.

    "Screw in the handholds to make different climbing routes.",
    "Place the hole in the handhold over one of the holes drilled in the wall.",
    "Use the screw provided with the handhold and a drill to secure it to the wall.",
    "Add as many handholds as you want depending on how easy or difficult you want the wall.",
    "Handholds can be purchased online or at specialty climbing stores.",
    "Some handholds can be attached with screws without a T-nut on the back.",
    "Make routes on the wall using different colored handholds.",
    "For example, space red handholds farther apart to make a difficult route or place green handholds close together to make an easy route.",
    "Place soft padding under the wall in case of falls.",
    "Place foam gymnastic mats or thin mattress under the walls so you have a cushion in case you fall off the wall.",
    "Cover the area around your wall since you will not always fall straight down next to the wall.",
    "Use thicker padding or double-layer what you have if you have a wall going higher than 8 feet (2.4 m)."
