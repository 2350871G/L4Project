Stair drawers have gained popularity as a creative storage solution, and can be installed in homes of almost any size. Each drawer is the length and width of one step, giving you tons of bonus space that was formerly off-limits. If your stairs has a stringer (or a support stand) running through the center, don't remove it. Put drawers on either side of the stringer.
