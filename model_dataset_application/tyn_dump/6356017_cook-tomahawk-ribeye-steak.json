      "description":"The Tomahawk Ribeye is a special type of cut steak which you may not be able to find in every local market. When purchasing this steak, you have to ask your butcher to cut it for you. The butcher will french-trim the meat, which is usually about 2 inches thick, and leave it attached to the rib bone. If you cannot find the steak at your local market, you could order it from specialty meat retailers online instead."

    {
      "headline":"Season the meat and let it rest.",
      "description":"Tomahawk steaks are such high quality flavorful steaks that you don't need to marinade them, but seasoning them slightly will help enhance the flavor. Brush the steak with a light coat of olive oil, then rub steak seasoning onto both sides of the meat. Alternatively, you could mix up some garlic, salt, and a little black pepper and rub this on top of the steak instead of using the steak seasoning. After you're done seasoning the meat, let it rest for approximately half an hour at room temperature before grilling it."

    {
      "headline":"Begin the reverse-sear.",
      "description":"A reverse-sear involves cooking your steaks at a low temperature until they're almost done, then elevating the temperature to seal in the juices and flavors. To start your reverse-sear, bring your grill up to 250 degrees, then let the steaks cook until they reach an internal temperature of 110-115 degrees. This should take approximately 45 minutes."

      "headline":"Finish the reverse-sear.",
      "description":"Once your grill has reached 600 degrees, put your steaks back on the grill for approximately 5 minutes per side to sear them and seal in the juices. When you've reached the 2.5 minute mark on each side, give your steaks a quarter-turn in order to create beautiful grill marks. Once your steaks have reached an internal temperature of 135 degrees, remove them from the grill."
