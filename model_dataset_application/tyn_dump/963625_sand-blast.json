          "headline":"Opt for mineral sand to remove rust and paint.",
          "description":"Mineral sands are composed of materials like olivine and staurolite and should be used on thick metal pieces with rust. This abrasive works quickly and can also be used to remove weathered coatings and scale. Silica sand is not commonly used due to the possibility of developing silicosis, a lung disease caused by inhalation of the silica dust. Sand creates friction as it is released from the blaster and generates heat. If you have a delicate or heat-sensitive material, it may deform. Sand can be reused if it\u2019s collected, but some of the sand will blow away if working outdoors."

          "headline":"Use plastic or a soda abrasive around sensitive areas.",
          "description":"For areas that are made of plastic or have electrical components, use a light abrasive. While these media work slower, they are more gentle to the material and will not damage the surface. Plastic beads are reusable if you use them in a blast cabinet."

        {
          "headline":"Pick glass beads for a smooth finish.",
          "description":"Glass beads are a harder material used to remove rust from metal without roughening the surface underneath. Use glass for cosmetic materials, like a car or tiling. Glass beads are a great choice for polishing metal, like cast iron, stainless steel, and aluminum. Glass beads can be reused if they\u2019re collected or used in a cabinet blaster."

Use walnut to polish and clean surfaces without leaving any patterning on the surface. Walnut can only be used once since the shells break apart upon impact."

If it is too strong, it could damage your material, but if it\u2019s too weak, it won\u2019t work efficiently. Check the specifications of the compressor before you choose which one to rent or buy. The PSI you need will depend on what material you\u2019re blasting. Start on a low setting and increase the pressure slowly until it fits your needs. Look up the material you\u2019re blasting to determine what PSI you should be using. The size of your air compressor will depend on the size of the job you have.

As a rule of thumb, select a nozzle that has a narrow opening that is about \u20448 inch (9.5 mm) to have the most concentrated stream of abrasive. As abrasive passes through the nozzle, the interior walls of the nozzle will start to wear away. Select a straight bore nozzle for a concentrated stream of abrasive. A Venturi nozzle will spread out the abrasive more, but it will give a more uniform particle distribution."

Wear protection that covers your eyes, mouth, and nose to prevent inhalation or eye damage. The abrasive comes out of the hose at high speed. Avoid pointing the nozzle at anyone or any part of your body. Wear long sleeves and pants to lower the amount of exposed skin. Wear coveralls to keep dust off of your clothes. Compressors are very loud and blasting abrasive only increases the volume. Wear earplugs or earmuffs to prevent hearing loss. Cabinet blasters have built-in gloves, but you should still wear eye and ear protection as well as a respirator."
