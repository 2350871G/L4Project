          "description":"Wallpaper comes in many different materials, featuring lots of different features to consider, depending on the job and the room. Some are more difficult to hang, while some are easy for the first-time user. Vinyl wallpaper is the most common variety, and is easy to hang and remove. Canvas-backed vinyl paper is moisture-resistent and versatile, making it very appropriate for hanging in bathrooms and basements. It's generally prepped with adhesive, which means it's easy to hang and handle. Embossed wallpaper is textured and patterned, making it ideal for covering the imperfections in walls. It's also easy to paint over and lined with adhesive, which means it'll be versatile for years to come. Textile-based wallpaper is more difficult to hang, because you'll have to hang with clear adhesive paste, which is more time-consuming but also gives you more control over the final product. Flocked textile wallpaper features raised patterns for a professional effect, but are difficult to clean."

If you want to buy a wallpaper with a distinctive pattern, make sure you take care to match-up the pattern and avoid clashing. You can also make the room seem larger using patterned wallpaper. Use horizontal patterns to make the room seem wider. If you've got a tall and skinny room,  you can make it seem cozier using horizontal patterns. Imperfectly squared rooms, however, can be affected slightly by using horizontally-patterend wallpaper, making it seem worse. Use vertical patterns to make the ceiling seem higher. If you've got low ceilings, vertical-patterning can help trick the eye."

To do so, you'll simply peel the adhesive strip off the back of the paper and press it firmly and evenly onto the wall, making it super-easy to use. Other varieties are often more involved. Pre-pasted wallpaper is similar to self-adhesive, except you need to activate the paste on the back of the paper, usually with water or another activator provided by the manufacturer. Dryback wallpaper requires that you also purchase wallpaper adhesive to use in the hanging of the paper. These types of wallpaper are often more intricate and expensive, but also more difficult to hang, especially alone."
