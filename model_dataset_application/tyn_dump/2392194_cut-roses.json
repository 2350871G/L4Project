The sharper the blade of the pruners or garden scissors, the easier it will be to trim the stem without squeezing it too hard. A pair of shears or scissors with a smaller head are best for reaching into thick bushes. As opposed to flat blades, curved blades tend to make the cleanest cuts. Some pairs of scissors and shears have a \u201ccut and hold\u201d feature that holds onto the stems when they\u2019re cut so they don\u2019t fall to the ground. Clean the blades often with rubbing alcohol or soap and water."

That\u2019s when they\u2019re driest and weakest. If you can\u2019t cut the flowers in the morning, late evening is the 2nd best time for cutting.If the roses are from your own garden, water them the night before you cut them.

The number of petals a rose variety has can affect which blooms you cut. For example, roses with more petals, like the Moonstone or St. Patrick types, can be cut at a more open stage. If you aren't sure which variety you have, ask your local nursery or look at a gardening book or website."

Longer stems allow you extra length at the end to trim off if you need to fit a vase, so cut them as low to the ground as you can. Cut stems from the front of the bush. The stems in the back haven\u2019t been exposed to as much sunlight, so they\u2019re usually weaker."
