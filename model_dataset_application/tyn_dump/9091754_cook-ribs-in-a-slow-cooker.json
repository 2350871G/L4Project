Slow-Cooking the Ribs Prepare the slow cooker. Spray the inside of the slow cooker with nonstick spray. Or you could place a disposable slow cooker insert into the cooker. Spread a little of the barbecue sauce along the bottom of the slow cooker. Arrange the ribs in the slow cooker. Place the ribs in the slow cooker and spread a little more sauce on top.
