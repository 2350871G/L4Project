Either way, using room temperature butter will make it easier to whip to the right consistency while minimizing the risk of lumps. Similarly, use butter over margarine when possible. When opting for margarine, use softened stick margarine over soft spreadable margarine, since both butter and stick margarine will hold their form better, resulting in a thicker frosting."
