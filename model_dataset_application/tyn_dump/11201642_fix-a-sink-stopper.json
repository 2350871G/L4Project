It will have a pair of hexagonal nuts holding it to the other pipes. Turn them counterclockwise by hand or by using a wrench if needed. Move the nuts to the side so you can slide the P-trap off the other pipes. Place a bucket underneath the P-trap before removing it. It typically has some water in it. It may also smell a little nasty, but that is normal. Removing the P-trap isn\u2019t strictly necessary when fixing a sink stopper. However, it\u2019s worth inspecting and cleaning along with the other pipes."

It\u2019s a round, plastic part that you can remove by hand and is recognizable by the horizontal rod passing through it. Twist it counterclockwise to remove it and set it aside. The retaining nut holds the levers that connect the stopper to its control on top of the sink. It\u2019s not hard to spot since you can see these levers underneath the sink. If the nut looks rusted or leaky, you may need to replace it. Try cleaning or tightening it first before getting a new one."

This will also free the sink stopper, which you can remove by pulling it out of the top of your sink. The pivot lever hooks to the hole at the bottom of the stopper. If the stopper is stuck, make sure the end of the pivot rod is free first. If the pivot rod and stopper weren't connected, that could be the issue. Reposition the stopper so the hole at the bottom faces the pivot rod. Then, push the end of the pivot rod into it."

    "It could also be responsible for a stuck stopper.",
    "Put the spring clip on the end of the pivot rod.",
    "Slide the pivot rod through one of the holes in the metal clip.",
    "The bend in the clip is meant to fit around the clevis.",
    "Don\u2019t slide the other end of the clip onto the pivot rod until you have finished assembling the stopper mechanism.",
    "If you\u2019re using bead-like clips, position them on opposite sides of the clevis.",
    "Slide one on the pivot rod, slide the pivot rod through the clevis, then add the second clip.",
    "Align the pivot rod with one of the holes in the clevis.",
    "The clevis will have 4 or 5 slots on it.",
    "The closest hole is fine when you\u2019re installing a new pivot rod but reposition the pivot rod as needed.",
    "Try to keep the pivot rod parallel to the ground so the stopper sits at a reasonable height.",
    "Once you have the components connected, slide the other end of the spring clip onto the pivot rod to hold everything in place.",
    "Reposition the rod to the next slot on the clevis.",
    "To get the stopper to stay down, raise the pivot rod up one slot.",
    "You can drop the pivot rod to a lower slot if you need to raise the stopper.",
    "Test the sink stopper to see if it works properly.",
    "Get out from under the sink and pull the lever that controls the stopper.",
    "It should cause the stopper to lower into the drain pipe.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t form a tight seal on the drain, you will need to readjust the pivot rod\u2019s positioning again.",
    "Having someone else on hand helps a lot.",
    "Let them press the lever while you watch the stopper components move.",
    "You will get a better view of the parts and can identify what isn\u2019t working without having to reach for the stopper lever!",
    "Loosen the screw on the clevis to fine-tune the stopper\u2019s positioning.",
    "The clevis has a screw at the top binding it to the stopper\u2019s control lever.",
    "Remove the spring clip and pivot rod first before making an adjustment.",
    "Then, loosen the screw to free the clevis and reposition it.",
    "You can slide it up a little bit to raise the stopper or move it down to lower the stopper.",
    "Return the screw, spring clip, and pivot rod when you\u2019re done.",
    "Repositioning the pivot rod is usually better, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t align with the clevis properly.",
    "Adjusting the clevis solves that problem.",
    "You may need to adjust the clevis a few times to get the stopper where you want it to be.",
    "Test it after each adjustment.",
    "Reattach the P-trap when you\u2019re ready to use the sink again.",
    "Lift the P-trap into the gap between the sink\u2019s tailpipe and the outlet pipe in the wall.",
    "Fit the P-trap in place, then slide the hexagonal nuts over the connections.",
    "Turn both of the nuts clockwise to secure the pipes together.",
    "When you\u2019re done, test out the sink to see if everything works correctly with no leaks.",
    "The shorter end of the P-trap fits on the tailpipe while the longer end connects to the outlet pipe.",
    "The U-shaped bend faces the floor.",
    "If you need to replace the hexagonal nuts or the P-trap, shop online or visit a hardware store.",
    "Slide the nuts onto the pipes first before attaching the P-trap."
