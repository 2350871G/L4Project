          "description":"Smothering your lawn will block light and prevent photosynthesis, killing the grass and weeds. The smothering method is not as dependent upon the weather as solarization or herbicides. Mow the grass closely. Cover it with layers of cardboard or newspaper (use black ink; colored ink could contain metals). Wet the covering and top it off with grass clippings (4 inches / 10 cm or more), compost, 6-inch (15cm) wood chips, or another organic mulch. Black plastic also works. It will block the sun and prevent photosynthesis. Avoid heavy mulching in shady areas,which prevents the soil from warming up, causing too much moisture in the root zone. The layers of your old lawn will break down, making compost. The soil is now ready for planting."

Weeds, seeds and pathogens are also removed.You\u2019ll need to cover the entire lawn with clear plastic\nKeep the lawn covered for about 7 weeks. Cloudy days slow things down. The hottest days with direct sunlight are optimal for solarization. Remove the plastic when the grass has died. The dead grass can also be removed, or you can leave it as compost. Clear plastic is preferable to opaque because more sunlight can get to the grass surface. Thick plastic will last longer because it\u2019s sturdier and resists tears."

Read the full label before you begin and be sure to follow all safety instructions, including the use of personal protective gear. Mix the herbicide in accordance with the directions on the product, then apply it over the entire lawn, taking care to avoid nearby garden plants. Select a herbicide that will degrade quickly. This will minimize how long it stays in the environment. Herbicides containing glyphosate are a wise choice. Add just a few drops of dishwashing liquid soap or another surfactant to help the herbicide stick to vegetation. Apply the herbicide on a sunny day (60 degrees or above) so that the herbicide will dry quickly. Choose a day with little to no wind to avoid drifting. Reapply the herbicide if the turf has not completely died. Wait about four weeks before reapplying. Wait one week after the final application. Till the dead turf into your soil."

          "description":"Sod removal works best for grass that doesn't have long roots. Grasses that are perennial, Bermuda grass and perennial rye, for instance, have roots that go down several feet. It\u2019s hard to get all of it by cutting away the sod. Kill the vegetation using one of the methods above first to make sod removal easier. Rent a sod cutter if you don\u2019t have one. They're about $70.00 per day. Alternately, you can use a flat shovel rather than a sod cutter. It\u2019s less expensive, but it\u2019s a lot more labor. Cut the sod into strips. After cutting the sod, roll up the strips and dispose of them. Alternately, you can leave the sod in place by inverting it and using it for compost. Cover the inverted sod in 6 to 10 layers of newspaper. The decomposed sod improves the soil and prevents grass from regrowing. Do not leave the sod in place if it contains undesirable weeds or invasive grasses. You can also use the inverted sod to make high places on your lawn or to fill in low places."

    "Keep the seeded area moist until the grass sprouts (about 3 weeks).",
    "Water for brief periods of time, but often.",
    "When the weather is warm, try for four or more times a day.",
    "Mow your new lawn.",
    "Mow for the first time after the grass has grown a third taller than its optimum height.",
    "Use sharp, straight, undamaged mower blades and go slowly to avoid damaging the new roots.",
    "Mow in different directions each time for more even cut and growth.",
    "Monitor your new lawn closely for the first 4-6 weeks.",
    "Avoid walking on the lawn or weeding it for the first 4-6 weeks.",
    "If weeds are still a problem in 6 weeks, remove them then.",
    "Spot spraying herbicide is more effective than hand pulling, but avoid multiple uses of the same herbicide.",
    "If applied too often, most broadleaf control products will kill the grass seedlings as well.",
    "Starting Your New Lawn Using Sod Test your soil.",
    "You'll need to confirm that the base of your lawn site will be a good fit for the sod you'll order.",
    "For about US$15.00 your local extension will send it to a lab for analysis.",
    "Grade the soil for your new lawn.",
    "You can fix existing problems by grading, as you prepare for sod to arrive:\nAvoid too much slope for your new lawn.",
    "The maximum slope is about twelve inches for every four feet.",
    "If your slope is greater than that you might need to build a retaining wall.",
    "Use a hose to water the site for your new lawn.",
    "Note areas where puddles have formed.",
    "Use a rake to fill in the low areas on your lawn with soil from the high spots.",
    "Be sure the finished grade is level with the areas surrounding your lawn site.",
    "If the soil test report suggests you need soil amendments, allow an additional 2 inches (5 cm) of depth to accommodate them.",
    "Buy your sod.",
    "This will generally be a mix of two to three turf grasses, ordered from a sod farm or a garden center.",
    "Let the supplier know your lawn's sun conditions before placing the order.",
    "Measure the square-footage of your lawn carefully so that you can order the right amount of sod.",
    "It\u2019s best to go over a bit to cover cutting around curves .",
    ".",
    ".",
    "about 5% over should do the trick.",
    "Lay the sod the same day it arrives.",
    "Two people could cover about a thousand square feet of sod in a day.",
    "If your yard is bigger, consider getting a little help from your friends to install the sod as quickly as possible.",
    "Lay the sod as follows:\nLay your first strip in the longest straight section of your yard.",
    "Keep off the sod during installation.",
    "Pat down the sod so that it\u2019s flat against the soil beneath it.",
    "Lay the next row of sod.",
    "Cut the sod in half first and lay it in a staggered design (as bricks are laid).",
    "Roll out each roll in the same direction.",
    "If rolled in different directions, your lawn will look uneven (at least at first), and the seams may be harder to lay with adjacent strips.",
    "Make sure the sections of sod are snug against each other, without overlapping.",
    "Continue this process for your whole lawn, cutting sections and staggering them as you lay them down.",
    "You can cut holes in the sod for ground sprinklers if you plan on using them.",
    "Use a knife to trim the sections of sod that abut paved areas.",
    "Roll out the lawn.",
    "Fill a lawn roller half full with water and walk over your lawn in various directions.",
    "This will press down the sod so its root base is firmly in contact with the soil, encouraging them to grow together.",
    "Water the newly sodded lawn frequently.",
    "Water just to the point of puddling, then stop.",
    "Depending on the weather, you may need to repeat this more than once a day to prevent the seeds from drying out.",
    "Avoid overwatering, which can prevent good soil contact and encourage fungal diseases if left damp overnight.",
    "Keep foot traffic on the sod to a minimum in the early stages.",
    "Mow and fertilize the lawn.",
    "When the grass reaches about 3 inches (8 cm) cut it down to 2 inches.",
    "The grass is still fragile, so use a regular lawnmower rather than heavier equipment.",
    "Grass in the heat of summer will fare better if allowed to grow taller and cut on the mower's highest setting.",
    "The taller growth helps retain moisture at ground level.",
    "After three to four weeks growth, add fertilizer to the lawn.",
    "This will replace nutrients lost to watering and wet weather."
