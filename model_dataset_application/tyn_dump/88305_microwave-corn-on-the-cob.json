Make sure each ear still has the husk around it and that it is ripe. Here's how you can check for ripeness:\nLook for corn with tassels, or strings, that are brown and sticky instead of dry and yellow. Brown, sticky tassels means the corn is ripe. Squeeze the ear gently to feel the kernels through the husk. They should feel plump and firm, but not hard as little pebbles. Try to buy only what you can eat within a few days, and keep it refrigerated so that the sugar in the corn kernels does not have time to get starchy and overripe. If you have too much corn on hand after a harvest, you can always freeze it."

In order to ensure that the corn cooks evenly, each ear should be near the center of the microwave without touching the other ears. To ensure even exposure and heating of each ear, arrange the ears in a triangle for three ears, or a square for four ears. Make sure the ears are not touching each other.

If you are cooking several ears at once, you can stop the cooking halfway through and turn the ears over to make sure they cook evenly.

Be cautious and use oven mitts or tongs to handle hot corn. Check that it is done by peeling back the husk and feeling or even nibbling a few kernels to test the temperature and the springiness of the kernels.
