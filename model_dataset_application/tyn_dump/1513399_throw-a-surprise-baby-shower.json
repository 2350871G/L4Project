          "description":"Surprise baby showers aren\u2019t for everyone, as pregnancy can be stressful and overwhelming without the added surprise of a party that they didn\u2019t know about. Try to make sure the guest of honor would truly want and like the surprise party before starting to plan it by asking close friends or family member's if the guest of honor would enjoy it. Try to ask the guest of honor's spouse or close friend if she would like a surprise baby shower in person as opposed to over text or email so the guest of honor is less likely to find out. If you want to keep it a surprise but also want the mom-to-be to feel prepared, consider telling them about the baby shower the day that it\u2019s happening. This way it\u2019s still a surprise, but they can get dressed and ready knowing they\u2019ll be around lots of people.

Pick a date 1-2 months before the due date so the mom will get to enjoy the shower even if the baby comes super early.

Making plans with the guest of honor yourself is also a great way to ensure they'll be available.

You should also take into consideration where the mom-to-be would enjoy celebrating, as well as a venue that will hold the amount of people you\u2019re hoping to invite. For example, hosting the shower at the guest of honor\u2019s house will make it hard for you to keep it a surprise and you won\u2019t have much time to set up.

If you don't want to create a registry, you can give guests a list of ideas for gifts to buy and encourage them to put the gift receipt with it just in case there are duplicates. Encourage the guest of honor to add necessary items to the list, such as diapers, clothing, bottles, or safety gear, as well as items that cost a range of prices.

    "Planning Decorations and Activities Choose a theme or color scheme for the party.",
    "Themes can help tie the entire baby shower together, giving you an opportunity to choose food, decorations, and games that all relate to one another.",
    "If you know the sex of the baby, you can pick out a theme relating to this, or you can go for a neutral theme such as a tiki luau, zoo animals, the circus, or the alphabet.",
    "You might choose a princess theme for a girl or a sports theme for a boy.",
    "If you wanted a beach theme, you could put up streamers in shades of blue to recreate the ocean, have a cake that looks like a sand castle, and put the party favors in little beach buckets.",
    "You can also opt for a color theme, such as gray, yellow, green, or purple.",
    "Plan the menu for the party.",
    "You\u2019ll want to pick out food for the guests to eat, along with a cake and drinks (both non-alcoholic and alcoholic, if desired).",
    "Choose foods that make sense for the time of day the party will be happening, and feel free to get creative to make the foods fit with the theme you\u2019ve chosen.",
    "Pick out foods the guest of honor likes or has been craving, and plan to buy enough to feed all of your guests.",
    "If you\u2019re having the party at 11 in the morning, you might have brunch foods such as eggs, muffins, and fruit.",
    "Consider having an afternoon cookout where you serve mini sliders, chips, and veggie and fruit platters.",
    "Decorate cookies or other sweets to fit the theme, or use cookie cutters to cut fruit or veggies into theme-specific shapes.",
    "Purchase supplies such as decorations, tableware, and party favors.",
    "Once you\u2019ve picked your theme, it\u2019ll make it easy to pick out which supplies you need.",
    "Choose decorations such as streamers, tablecloths, and balloons in your desired color scheme.",
    "Make sure you have all the plates, cups, and utensils you\u2019ll need, and stock up on party favors to give to each of your guests that will be coming.",
    "If you\u2019re planning a party with a gray and yellow color scheme, purchase streamers, plates, and party favors in these colors.",
    "For a barn-themed baby shower, have the guests place the presents in a wheelbarrow, purchase plates with farm animals on them, or give the guests Peeps as a party favor.",
    "Prepare baby-related games to play.",
    "You can make up your own baby games that go with your theme, or you can opt for traditional baby shower games that are often played.",
    "Pick out 3 games that you think will be fun, and gather all the supplies you\u2019ll need to put them together.",
    "You can find lots of ideas for baby shower games by doing a quick online search.",
    "For example, have everyone taste baby food and guess the flavor or have everyone decorate a baby onesie with fabric markers or paint."
