Peel, quarter, and stuff the onion with cloves. Remove the outer layers of the white onion. Cut the peeled onion into quarters. Stud each quarter with one clove. Combine the ingredients in a saucepan. Pour 1 liter of full fat milk into the sauce pan. Add the quartered onions, 2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon whole white peppercorn, 2 blades of mace, and 1 teaspoon table salt. If you are using ground mace, sprinkle it into the milk.
