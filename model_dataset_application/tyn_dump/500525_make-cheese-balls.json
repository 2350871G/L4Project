    "Create the dough by mixing together 1 cup (125 g) panko breadcrumbs, 2 cups (312 g) chopped steamed broccoli, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup (93.75 g) of shredded cheddar cheese, and 1/4 tsp (1.25 g) of salt and black pepper.",
    "Then, consider adding 2 cloves of minced garlic and scallions to round out the flavors.",
    "Place marble-sized balls of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet.",
    "Break off a small piece of dough that is roughly the size of a marble and roll it with your hands.",
    "Place the ball of dough onto the baking sheet.",
    "Leave 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of space between each row and column of dough balls.",
    "To make the process move faster, use a teaspoon as a small scoop to break off pieces of dough that are the same size.",
    "If you did not add additional vegetables or meat to your dough, consider stuffing the cheese balls as you roll them.",
    "For example, take your portioned piece of dough and wrap it evenly around a pimento-stuffed olive or a small dice of cooked chicken.",
    "Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 1 hour.",
    "Maintain the shape of the cheese ball by chilling the dough in the refrigerator before baking.",
    "This will give the handled dough a chance to firm and will keep it from spreading or flattening in the oven.",
    "Bake the chilled cheese balls in the oven at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 15 minutes.",
    "Check on the cheese balls after the 15 minutes.",
    "The tops of the cheese balls should have a light, golden-brown coloring.",
    "If the cheese balls still appear doughy or pale, continuing baking them for another 5 minutes.",
    "Arrange the cheese balls on a platter and serve immediately.",
    "Create a single layer of cheese balls on a platter to keep them from getting soggy as they cool.",
    "Just be careful when eating the cheese balls after they come out of the oven, as they may still be very hot.",
    "Store leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week."
