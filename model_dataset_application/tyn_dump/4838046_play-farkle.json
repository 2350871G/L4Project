Establishing a threshold in players' opening turns before they can begin scoring. Common thresholds are 350, 400, 500, and 1,000. At the beginning of the game, each player must throw in their turn until they reach the threshold; after that point, they can choose to stop or keep rolling in all subsequent turns. Changing the winning score to greater or less than 10,000 points (e.g., 20,000 or 5,000 points). Another option is to make the score exactly 10,000 points, which is called the \"welfare\" version of Farkle. If a player scores above 10,000, all points won during that turn are transferred to the player with the lowest score. Changing the farkling rules. If a player farkles three times in a row, he/she loses 500 or 1,000 points. Allowing players to begin their turn by rolling the dice remaining from the previous player's roll (those dice not set aside for scoring). If the player scores with any of the dice on the first roll, they receive 1,000 points in addition to any other points they win. This is called the High Stakes (Piggy-backing) variant."
