If not, use a clean cutting board and sharp knife to finely mince the root. The finer the mince, the more flavorful your dip will be. Fresh horseradish can be super pungent and can irritate your nose and eyes, so avoid touching your face after handling it. Open a window if the scent gets to be too strong. If you don\u2019t have access to fresh horseradish, you can also use the jarred and preserved variety you find at the grocery store.

Put everything into the mixing bowl along with the grated horseradish root. For an even punchier sauce, substitute the Dijon mustard for the same amount of whole grain mustard. You can use low-fat sour cream, but the consistency of the sauce won\u2019t be as creamy and the flavor not quite as rich as it would be with regular sour cream. The white wine vinegar neutralizes the enzymes that were released when the horseradish root was grated. The longer you wait to add the white vinegar to the horseradish, the spicier your sauce will be."
