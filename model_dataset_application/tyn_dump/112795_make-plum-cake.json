Once the egg yolks are incorporated, consider adding fragrant extracts to enhance the flavor. For example, add 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) of almond extract.

    "Cream the butter with the sugar.",
    "Add the soft butter to a large mixing bowl.",
    "Use an electric mixer or a whisk to turn the butter into a creamy paste.",
    "Next, add in the sugar.",
    "Continue mixing the sugar and butter mixture until it resembles light fluffy sand.",
    "Make sure to use a very large mixing bowl, as you will be adding other ingredients to the butter mixture.",
    "Add the egg yolks and lemon zest to the butter mixture.",
    "Use an electric mixer or a whisk to incorporate the egg yolks and lemon zest into the butter mixture.",
    "When you first start mixing, the egg yolks won\u2019t mix well and the batter will look strange.",
    "However, the egg yolks will eventually become incorporated and the batter will look smooth and creamy.",
    "Once the egg yolks are incorporated, consider adding fragrant extracts to enhance the flavor.",
    "For example, add 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) of almond extract.",
    "To further enhance the flavor, consider adding the zest of other citrus fruits as well.",
    "For example, add an extra teaspoon (5 grams) of orange zest.",
    "Sift the baking powder and flour into a bowl.",
    "Sifting will aerate the flour and remove any lumps in the baking powder.",
    "First, hold a sifter over a large bowl.",
    "Pour in the flour and move the sifter from side to side.",
    "Once all of the flour has fallen into the bowl, pour the baking powder into the sifter and repeat the process.",
    "If you want a slightly spiced plum cake, add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture.",
    "After sifting, use a whisk to mix the baking soda and the flour together.",
    "Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture.",
    "Add about half of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and blend it together.",
    "Once the flour is completely absorbed, add the rest of the flour mixture.",
    "Continue mixing until all of the flour has been incorporated into the batter.",
    "Fold in the egg whites.",
    "Add about a quarter of the whipped egg whites into the mixture.",
    "Use a spatula to fold the egg whites into the mixture.",
    "To do so, scoop batter from underneath the egg whites and gently drape them towards the center of the bowl.",
    "Turn the bowl slightly and repeat the process until the egg whites disappear.",
    "Continue folding in batches egg whites until all of the egg whites are incorporated.",
    "Resist the urge to stir the mixture.",
    "If you do, the cake will flatten in the oven.",
    "Baking the Cake Preheat your oven.",
    "Set your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, or 190 degrees Celsius.",
    "Many modern ovens will alert you when they\u2019re done preheating.",
    "If yours doesn\u2019t have this feature, preheat the oven for at least ten minutes to bring it to temperature.",
    "Grease and flour a cake pan.",
    "You can use two circular 8-inch (21cm x 5cm) cake pans, a nine-inch (23cm x 8cm) Bundt pan, or two 8-inch (23cm x 13cm x 6cm) loaf pans.",
    "Rub the inside of the pan and dust it with flour to create a non-stick surface.",
    "Alternatively, spray cooking spray on the inside of the pan.",
    "Discard any extra flour leftover from greasing and flouring the pan.",
    "Pour in the batter.",
    "Gently pour the cake batter into the cake pans.",
    "Use a spatula to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl clean.",
    "If you\u2019re using two cake pans, fill them as evenly as you can.",
    "To do so, add a large dollop of cake batter to each pan until all of it has been used.",
    "Arrange the sliced plums.",
    "If you want to create a beautiful pattern, carefully arrange the sliced plums in a spiral formation.",
    "If you want to create a rustic, haphazard look, drop the plum slices into the batter in a random pattern.",
    "If you are using plum halves instead of slices, set the plum halves in the batter flesh-down and press gently.",
    "Don\u2019t press the plums too far into the batter.",
    "The batter will rise around the plums in the oven.",
    "Bake the cake for 40-45 minutes.",
    "When finished, the cake will have a golden-brown crust.",
    "To test whether or not your cake is done, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake.",
    "If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done baking.",
    "If it\u2019s covered in batter, let the cake continue baking for five more minutes and check it again.",
    "Place the cake on a pastry rack to cool.",
    "Once the cake is done cooking, remove it from the oven.",
    "Slide the cake out of the pan and onto a wire baking rack to cool.",
    "If you let it cool in the pan, the bottom will become soggy.",
    "Allow the cake cool completely.",
    "While the cake is cooling, dust a layer of confectioner\u2019s sugar over the top to add visual excitement.",
    "Serve the plum cake.",
    "Once the cake has cooled, serve your plum cake with a hot cup of tea or coffee.",
    "Alternatively, make a caramel sauce and pour it over a slice of plum cake before serving it.",
    "Finally, if you have a strong sweet tooth, serve a slice of cake with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.",
    "Refrigerate any leftover cake.",
    "Eat the cake within three days of baking it.",
    "Another Way to Make Plum Cake (see \"for Method 2\" under \"Ingredients\") Cook the jam and brandy in a skillet over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, or until it is a thick syrup.",
    "Remove the pan from the heat and add plums, cut side down, into the syrup.",
    "Return the pan to the heat, and cook until the syrup is thick again.",
    "Be sure the plums don't stick to the pan.",
    "Cool the syrup and plums for about 20 minutes.",
    "Move the oven rack into the middle of the oven and pre-heat to 350 degrees.",
    "In the mean time, grease and flour a 9-inch springform pan.",
    "Put the sugar and almonds through a food processor until the ingredients are finely ground.",
    "This should only take a minute or two.",
    "Add the flour, baking powder, and salt.",
    "Use the \"pulse\" setting on the food processor to mix the ingredients.",
    "Add the eggs, vanilla, butter, and almond extract.",
    "Process the ingredients until the batter is smooth.",
    "This should take under a minute.",
    "You may want to scrape the bowl with the spatula to keep it from sticking.",
    "Pour the batter into the pan that you previously greased.",
    "Using the spatula, smooth out the edges and the top of the cake.",
    "Return to the pan containing the plums.",
    "Stir them around until they are coated with the syrup.",
    "Place the plums evenly on top of the batter.",
    "Do not push them down in too far, let them rest at the surface.",
    "Place the cake in the pre-heated oven.",
    "Bake the cake for about 40-50 minutes, or until golden brown.",
    "Put a wooden skewer through the center of the cake and remove; the cake is ready when the skewer comes out with only a few crumbs of cake.",
    "Loosen the cake around the edges with a knife, and allow cake to cool for 30 minutes or so.",
    "Transfer the cake to a large platter.",
    "Lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar.",
    "Slice into eight triangular wedges and serve."
