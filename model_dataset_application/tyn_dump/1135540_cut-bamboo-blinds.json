Check the width in the middle and the bottom of your window in case it isn't perfectly square. Write down your measurements so you don't forget them later. If you plan on hanging your blinds outside of the trim, be sure to measure from the outer edges of the trim rather than the size of the window."

          "description":"Use your tape measure to find the width of your blinds so you know how much you need to trim. Look at the top bar of your blinds to see how much space there is between the ends and the mounting hardware. If you only need to make a minor adjustment, you can cut one side of the blinds, but if you need to remove more than 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm), then cut a little bit off of each side. For example, if your window is 36 inches (91 cm) wide and your blinds are 40 inches (100 cm) wide, then you can either trim 4 inches (10 cm) off of one side or you can remove 2 inches (5.1 cm) off of each side. Use bamboo blinds that are only slightly larger than your window since you can only remove about 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm) total. Most bamboo blinds are asymmetrical, meaning the hardware is usually closer to one end than it is to the other."

Measure the same distance from the edge in 2 more places to ensure you draw a straight line. Lay a straightedge so it lines up with your marks and use a pencil to draw your line. Repeat the process on the other side of the blinds if you need to trim both ends."

Cut a piece of tape that's as long as the lines you drew and press it onto the bamboo. Make sure your tape is on the side of the line that you aren't removing or else the edges will fray.

Pull the saw handle down slowly and cut through your blinds. Once the first cut is finished, lift the handle of the saw back up to stop it. Make cuts on the other side of the roll if you need to.
