  "text":" Making the Perler Design Gather your materials. While Perler beads, jump rings, and Perler accessories can usually be found in craft stores, you might have to order the key chains online. You can also just use string to attach your creation to the item you're accessorizing. Prepare the work area. Pull out a pegboard, if you're using one, or use a hard, iron-safe work surface like a wooden table. Make your pattern. Arrange the Perler beads on the pegboard or surface in whatever pattern you want, such as a heart or Pokeball. Use a picture for reference if you need to. Prepare to iron. If using a pegboard, carefully transfer it to an ironing board and turn on the iron. If not using a pegboard, leave the beads on the surface and turn on the iron. Place a sheet of parchment paper or Perler ironing paper over your design. Make sure the iron is on a \"dry\" setting, not a steam one. Press the hot side of the iron over the beads. Carefully move it in a circular motion, making sure that all of the beads are fused. Pressing too hard or moving too roughly can knock beads out of place! Completely fused beads shouldn't have visible holes in the center. Set the iron aside. Put a heavy flat object on top of your creation and let the beads cool. Remove the heavy object. Lift the fused beads and flip them over, then iron the back for a smooth, finished look. Turning Your Craft into a Keychain Carefully poke a hole through one of the perimeter beads. If you have jump rings, spread one open with your fingers or jewelry pliers. Push it through the hole in your creation. If using string, thread it through the hole. Secure the jump ring around the key chain's end, joining it through  the key chain's last link. If using string, simply loop the string through the key chain's last link (you can loop it through more than once for extra strength), tie it off in a knot, and trim the ends. Attach the key chain to a buckle, zipper tag, or decorative metal loops on the purse/backpack/etc. Alternatively, tie the Perler bead creation directly to the purse/backpack/etc. using string.",
