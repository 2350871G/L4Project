Roll the roller in the tray to load it with primer, and begin rolling the primer on the floor, starting in a back corner of the garage. When you start, apply more primer directly over your border, rather than starting right beside it. Cover a length of floor about 3 feet (0.9 m) long and 2 feet wide (1.2 m long and 0.6 m wide) at a time before freshening the roller with more primer.

This will help to disperse over a wider area, instead of in clumps. Before you begin painting, do a test run with your chips once your primer has dried. Be sure that you have have enough to cover the entire floor. Also, practice your tosses so you don't end up using all your flakes before the end due to poor dispersal.

If you do a second coat, be aware that many experts recommend applying second coats in a perpendicular fashion to the first. For example, if you rolled from the back of the garage toward the door, you should then roll from one side of the garage to the other during the second coat. However, the confines of your garage might not allow you to do this so easily. In this case, just apply the second coat in the same exact fashion as the first.
