Essential supplies for moving are: a variety of small, medium and large packing boxes; packing tape; permanent markers for identifying box contents; box labels or colored tape for coding the contents of your boxes; packing material such as bubble wrap or newspaper; and furniture pads. Sandwich bags are an excellent option for packing small parts. Plastic wrap such as Glad Press n\u2019 Seal will allow you to seal clothing in drawers so that you don\u2019t have to pack them in a separate box.
