The SCOBY is sensitive to high temperatures, so it\u2019s very important that you wait until the tea has cooled before moving on to the next step. You can speed up the cooling process by placing your kettle in an ice bath for around 30 minutes. Make sure the tea is at most 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) before adding the SCOBY.

A tight weave cloth will have strands of fabric in close proximity to each other and will keep bugs out of your brew while allowing air to circulate. Cheese cloth is the best cloth to use for brewing kombucha, although coffee filters will also work. Make sure whatever cloth you use is breathable.
