  "text":" Creating the Base Find a bottle large enough to fit your phone. Try to find a bottle that is more oval in shape rather than round; the flattened back will help it rest better against the wall when you hang it. A 15-ounce (444-milliliter) shampoo or conditioner bottle will fit most phones. Hold your phone against it to test the size\u2013\u2013the edges should extend around the outside of the phone Remove the labels and clean the bottle, inside and out. Rinse the bottle out in hot water to remove any residue left inside. Peel off the label and remove any residue using white vinegar, oil, or a glue remover (ie: Goo Gone). Allow the bottle to dry upside down before proceeding. Mark where you want the opening to start with a permanent marker. Hold your phone against the bottle, with the bottom edges lined up.

Wipe away any marker lines with rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. Simply dampen a cotton ball or pad with your desired product, then wipe it over the pen marks.
