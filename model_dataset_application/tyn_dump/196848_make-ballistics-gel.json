Preparing the Mold Obtain a large plastic storage container. Find a container that is 12 (h) x 12 (w) x 20 (l) inches in size. Avoid containers with patterns on the sides or bottom, as it will make removing the gel more difficult. Measure and mark the mold. Measure the inside wall 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the bottom of the container and mark it with a permanent marker. This will be the line that you fill the water to. Spray the container with non-stick cooking spray. Coat the entire inside with spray to help release the gel when it is finished. Wipe any excess spray out to avoid cloudiness in the finished gel.
