Typically, these products are a powder that you must combine with an equal amount of water in a handheld sprayer. Borate works best in wood that won\u2019t be exposed to water. It is a chemical that is not a threat to your health, unlike gas fumigants."

This is difficult in homes, where most of the wood will be covered, so it\u2019s best to apply borate when the house is framed. If your wood furniture has varnish, you\u2019ll need to strip the varnish so the borate can soak into the wood. Scrape off the varnish or apply a chemical stripper. Any stains left by the borate should be wiped up with warm water before the finish is reapplied."

You will have to treat the wood in a kiln, heating chamber, or freezer. The object would have to be heated for one and a half hours at 150\u2109  (66\u2103) or frozen at -4\u2109 (-20\u2103) for a week. Search your area for commercial treatment areas if you don\u2019t have the space or tools to do it yourself. The wood must sealed in a bag before freezing to protect it from moisture.
