Hold the suede in place, and move the rotary cutter across the surface, pressing down as you go. If it doesn't go all the way through, run the cutter back over it. Most suede is thin enough to use a rotary cutter. If your cutter still isn't going all the way through, try another technique, or switch out your blade for a sharper one. A rotary cutter is like a pizza cutter. It has a round blade that goes around in a circle. You can find one at fabric or leather stores."

Create a straight line across the suede. Make sure to keep your hand out of the way as you make cuts. Don't cut towards your hand. Use this type of tool to cut out shapes like triangles or squares. You can then use them as decorative pieces on purses, pillows, or even a leather jacket."

Any scissors will do, but leather scissors or a heavy-duty pair of sewing scissors will work best. You can use round cuts to create curved shapes like swirls or circles to use for decorations."

          "description":"Suede doesn't really have a wrong side, as both sides have a nap. However, you can designate a side that will be on the inside of your piece so you can mark a pattern. It can be difficult to get any marks out of it, so make sure you hide the marks in the finished product. You can use a ballpoint pen, a grease marker, or a leather marking pen. The leather marking pen may come out, but since most suede is not coated, it may not. You can even use a silver or black permanent marker. Suede should generally not be washed at home, so don't try to run it through the washing machine before using it, even if you've marked it up."

          "description":"A straight edge can help you cut a sharp line, but it also helps hold the leather in place. Press down on the straight edge, and cut along it with a utility knife or rotary cutter. It's best to choose a ruler that has a non-skid back. If yours doesn't, try hot gluing a strip of felt on it or using non-skid tape."

          "description":"If your blade isn't sharp, it's not going to cut all the way through. Plus, you may leave a rough edge behind. Always begin with a sharp blade, no matter what kind of knife or scissors you're using. For blades like utility cutters or craft knives, you may need to change out the blade. Other blades, like the ones on scissors, can be sharpened."

          "headline":"Use a cutting mat for a soft, stable cutting surface.",
          "description":"A cutting mat can help protect the surface you're working on and make it easier to cut through thick suede. Set the mat up on a flat surface, and hold the suede down on top. Follow the geometric lines on the cutting mat to make intricate cuts, or to cut out evenly-sized pieces. A self-healing cutting mat is your best option, which actually closes up around the cut you made in the surface each time. Also, a slightly softer surface like a cutting mat will keep your blades from dulling so quickly."

          "headline":"Pay attention to the nap when cutting for sewing.",
          "description":"Suede has a nap, which means it has tiny fibers that run one direction, like a grain. If you flip them up with your hand, you'll have a different color than if you're smoothing them down. You can decide how you want the nap to go, but make sure you're cutting your pieces all the same way so they're consistent. If the nap is smooth when it's facing upward on a piece, the piece will be darker. If it's facing downward, it will look a little frosted."

Use the top part of the square to create an even width at the top of the suede, which will form the band that holds the fringe in place. The other part of the square should be on top of the suede going down, so that you can use it to guide your cut. A thick band at the top will keep your fringe from coming apart."

Press down on the square, and run a utility knife down the length of the suede, starting at the bottom edge of the square at the top. Once you get the hang of it, you can decide how thick or thin you want the fringe. Pressing down helps hold the square in place while you cut."
