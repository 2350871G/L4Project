The leaves should be as long as either the diameter of the petals for the open flower or the height of the quartered tissue paper for the closed rose. Roll the leaves around a pen. Bunch the leaves over the bottom end of a pen as described in Step 3 of Method 1. Curling them slightly gives them a more realistic look.

Keep twisting until the stem is about three centimeters long. Add the leaves. Pinch one end of a leaf and twist the stem around it. Give the stem another few twists, and then add a second leaf.
