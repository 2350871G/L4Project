    "Just remember to remove them before you carve and serve the ham.Optional: Prior to scoring and glazing, some cooks prefer to remove the rind, or the skin, and top layer of fat.",
    "If you\u2019d like, slice and peel them off with a sharp knife.",
    "Then score the ham by making \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) deep cuts across the its surface.",
    "Brush the ham with about a third of the glaze.",
    "Use a basting brush or a spoon to coat the ham with a portion of the glaze.",
    "Be sure to work the glaze into the ham\u2019s scored lines or spiral cuts.",
    "The sugars in the glaze will caramelize, yielding an attractive, flavorful, and candy-like skin.",
    "Glazing the ham too early in the cooking process will lead to a scorched ham, so wait until the last 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "Raise the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and continue baking the ham.",
    "Return the ham to the oven and continue baking it, uncovered, until the glaze begins to become shiny, crispy, and slightly brown.",
    "Raise the temperature when you first remove the ham so the oven has time to heat.",
    "Brush on another third of the glaze after about 10 minutes.",
    "Work quickly when you brush on more glaze to prevent the oven temperature from dropping too low.",
    "Keep the ham in the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes until the surface is crisp, brown, and caramelized.",
    "Be sure to keep a close eye on the ham through the oven window to keep it from burning.",
    "Serving Your Glazed Ham Remove the ham from the oven and let it rest.",
    "Take the ham out of the oven, transfer it to a carving board, and turn off the oven.",
    "Tent it loosely with foil, and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "While the ham rests, its internal temperature will increase a bit.",
    "This means the final serving temperature will be around 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) for a cured ham and 145 to 150 \u00b0F (63 to 66 \u00b0C) for one that was uncooked when you purchased it.",
    "For a fresh, uncooked ham, 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) is the recommended safe internal temperature.",
    "A cured ham was already cooked, so it\u2019s even safe to eat cold.",
    "Make a quick sauce with the rest of the glaze.",
    "While the ham rests, whisk 2 to 4 tablespoons of the pan juices with the remaining third of the glaze until you\u2019ve thinned it into a sauce.",
    "To keep the glaze warm, place the saucepan over a burner set to low heat and stir it occasionally.",
    "Present the ham to your guests before carve it.",
    "Garnish the ham with a bouquet of fresh herbs, such as parsley or watercress, and show it off to your guests.",
    "Once they've had a chance to admire your handiwork, you can get to carving and serving the ham.",
    "Carve the ham into \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) slices.",
    "If your ham isn\u2019t pre-cut, slice it yourself with a sharp carving or chef\u2019s knife.",
    "First, remove the cloves, if you inserted any into the scored surface.",
    "Cut off a few slices to flatten the thinner side, then turn the ham onto the flat side so it won\u2019t roll as you carve the meatier side.",
    "If you look at the cut side, you\u2019ll see that the bone is closer to one edge.",
    "This is the thinner side, and you want to carve the opposite, meatier side.",
    "Slice straight down into the ham until you reach the bone.",
    "Make cuts every \u20444 inch (0.64 cm), then run the knife horizontally along the bone to remove the slices.",
    "If you bought a spiral-sliced ham, simply cut along the bone to remove the slices.",
    "Serve the ham slices with your glaze sauce.",
    "Transfer the slices, along with your garnishes, to a serving platter.",
    "Set a serving fork on the platter, and pour the glaze sauce into a gravy boat.",
    "Bring the boat and platter to the table, serve your guests, and invite them to add sauce to their liking.",
    "Pair your glazed ham with side dishes such as balsamic green beans, mashed or scalloped potatoes, and roasted carrots."
