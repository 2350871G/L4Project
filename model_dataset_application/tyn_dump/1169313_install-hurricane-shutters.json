  "text":" Accordion Shutters Pull out the parts and lay them out on your driveway or lawn near the window they will be protecting. Each part should come numbered and pre-drilled. Place the top track above the top of the window. Level and mark your wall to line up with the pre-drilled hole(s). Attach this part with 2.25-inch (57.150 mm) concrete anchors and screws. The ends of these screws should remain out until the sides are put on. Make sure the track is level. Position the wheels into the top and make sure the pins face the outside. Adjust the curtains as needed so they are away from the edges. Each wheel assembly should be marked left or right. Attach one side panel with 2.25-inch (57.150 mm) concrete anchors and screws. Check that the panel is straight and flush with the top piece. The smaller part of the side panel should face inward toward the window. Fasten the bottom panel with the same-sized concrete anchors and screws. Insert the bushings at the back of the curtains into the grooves on the bottom track. Affix the start strips of the curtains to the side panels with the screws provided.  Check that the sides of the accordion close and lock properly.  Caulk around the sides of your accordion shutters, if desired.  Bahama Shutters Check that the build-out frame (BOF) numbers match the numbers on the shutter frames.  Place the BOF frame against the window and attach an included fastener (usually a screw) to the top corner of the frame.  Attach the last side panel using the same instructions as the first.  Ensure the frame is even with the window and put in another screw at the opposite bottom corner. This screw should be diagonal to the first. Attach the rest of the screws into the holes provided.  Place plastic plugs into the holes on the BOF and caulk around the sides of the frame, if desired.  Affix the shutter frames to the BOF by the top center pre-drilled holes with the provided screws. Install the leftover screws into the hinge holes. Attach rubber pieces to each bottom corner of the Bahama shutter frame and close the frame.  Mark the center of the tabs on the build off frame and mark the center of the tabs.  Pierce the center of the tabs with the included drill bit.  Create threads by using a 1/4-20 or a size 7 tap.  Close the shutters and insert a .25-inch (6.35 mm) screw into the tabs and BOF.  Remove the screws in the tabs to install the open rod and push the shutter out.  Place the rod in the tab on the shutter frame and a 3/8-inch (10 mm) hole on the bottom of the BOF. Put the screws back into the BOF. Roll Down Shutters Lay the shutter flat with the \"ears\" facing up.  Measure the shutter box and tracks to ensure it is 8 inches (203 mm) longer than the window or door.  Attach alignment rails to the base of the box and lean the structure against a wall until you are ready to lift it.  Secure the highest alignment hole and place the structure over the window into proper position. Level the structure and label the locations of other alignment holes. Mark an upright line between the operational end cap and the alignment rail. Make a straight line where the operational side alignment rail meets the end cap. A stamp should be made at the peak of the end cap. Put the shutter down on the ground again. Measure towards the window 5/8 inches (15.875 mm) on your vertical line. If your shutter is a top exit you also have to measure down 3/4 inches (19 mm) from the top line you drew. Drill marked holes including a \"control\" hole for the strap which should be .75 inches (19 mm). It is important that this hole be straight and even. Secure the belt through the hole and attach the structure to the brackets on the wall with concrete anchor screws.  Check clearance and let the shutter lower into place. Remove the protective covering of the shutter and fasten its housing box into the wall with flat screws. Put the manual crank box on a level surface and take off the cover. Take out the big plastic gear and thread the belt through. Ensure you have a firm knot on the end of the belt and pull it to place the knot into the gear. Install motors and put back on the cover. Retighten the screws on the cover. Place the crank box into position and have an electrician run and hook up the wires in the soffit. Secure the crank box with screws. Test your shutter to make sure it rolls up and down correctly. Caulk the outer edges and remove any protective films.",
