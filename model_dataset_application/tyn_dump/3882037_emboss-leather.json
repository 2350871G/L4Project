  "text":" Clamp Embossing Leather Purchase unfinished leather at a craft supply store. Embossing doesn\u2019t work on pre-treated clothing or accessories. Find a sturdy metal shape or a metal leather stamp. You can use a charm or purchase a leather stamp in the design of your choice online. You can order custom leather stamps through sellers on Etsy. If you use a metal charm, make sure it has cut edges, rather than a tapered design. It will make your shape appear more pronounced in the leather. Smooth your unfinished leather section onto a worktable. The front side should be facing up. It must be near the edge of a table on which you can hook a strong C-clamp. Dampen a sponge. You don\u2019t want it to be sopping wet, so squeeze it out several times. Brush the leather with the sponge in one even layer. Move the leather so that it can fit under the clamp. Place the flat metal stamp or metal object on the leather where you want the embossed design to be.  Set the top foot of the C-clamp in the center of the metal object. Crank the clamp until it is clamped as far as it will go. Remove the C-clamp after 20 minutes. Seal the leather with leather finish, if you want to improve the durability of the design and surface of the leather. Leather finish should be applied after all embossing is complete. It should also be done before you sew or complete assembly on a leather project. Stamping Leather Purchase a leather stamping set online or at a craft store. Buy 3-D stamps with a cylinder that can be inserted into any of the flat stamps. You can order custom stamps online or start with a set of alphabet stamps.
