  "text":" Baking Crisp Matzo Place an upside-down baking sheet in the oven and turn the oven to 500 \u00b0F (260 \u00b0C). You'll be cooking the matzo on the baking sheet and heating it ensures that the matzo will become crisp. If you prefer, use a pizza stone instead of a baking sheet. Mix the flour, salt, olive oil, and water in a bowl. Put 2 cups (240 g) of all-purpose flour into a mixing bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of kosher salt along with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) plus 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of olive oil. Use your fingers or a spoon to stir in \u20443 cup (79 ml) plus 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of water. You can use virgin or extra-virgin olive oil or substitute another oil, such as canola, coconut, or vegetable oil, if you prefer. Knead the matzo dough for 4 to 5 minutes. Use your fingers to fold and stretch the dough in the bowl until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Keep folding and stretching the dough until it's soft and easy to knead. If the dough is still too dry, mix in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water at a time. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll each as thin as possible. Portion the dough into equal pieces and set them on a floured work surface. Take a rolling pin and roll each piece out so it's as thin as you can make it. If you can, roll the matzos so thinly that you can hold them up and see light coming through them. Roll the matzos into any shape you like so they're at least 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. Try simple ovals or rectangles, for instance. Poke the surface of the matzos with a fork and brush them with oil if you like. Push the tines of a fork into the surface of each matzo piece to prevent them from puffing up too much as they bake. If you'd like the matzos to be golden on top, dip a pastry brush into vegetable or olive oil and brush it over the top of each matzo.Tip: If you want extra-flavorful matzos, sprinkle a little flaky sea salt over them or scatter sesame seeds on top for a little crunch. Lay 1 or 2 matzos on the hot baking sheet. You might be able to fit 2 pieces on the sheet if your sheet is large enough. If it isn't big enough, you'll have to bake 1 matzo at a time. It's fine to place the matzos close together on the baking sheet since they won't expand as they bake. Just ensure that the pieces aren't touching. Bake the matzos for 3 to 4 minutes and flip them halfway through the baking time. Let the matzos bake on the sheet until they're crisp and brown. To help them cook evenly, use tongs to carefully flip them over halfway through the cooking time. Cool the matzos on a rack and store them at room temperature for up to 1 week. Arrange the matzos in a single layer on a cooling rack. Serve the matzos once they're completely cool or put them into an airtight storage container and use them within 1 week. The matzos will soften the longer they're stored, so eat them quickly if you like them crisp. Making Simple Roti Flatbreads Combine whole-wheat flour, salt, and oil in a bowl.
