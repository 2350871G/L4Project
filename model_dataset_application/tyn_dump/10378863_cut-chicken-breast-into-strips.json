A longer knife will help you make smooth, clean cuts instead of having to make repeated cuts like a shorter knife would. A chef\u2019s knife is also sturdy enough to cut through meat with just a little bit of pressure. An easy way to sharpen a knife is with a knife sharpener. Press the knife blade into the side labeled as \u201ccoarse\u201d and pull it towards you a couple of times, applying gentle pressure. Then pull it through the \u201cfine\u201d side. Chef\u2019s knives vary greatly in price based on quality and materials. Shop around at a kitchen store or an online retailer to pick one that you like and that\u2019s comfortable to hold."

You don\u2019t need to cover the breast and you can either leave it in the packaging or remove it first. If you don\u2019t want to wait for the chicken to get firm in the freezer, use a paper towel to pat the chicken dry before cutting. This won\u2019t be as effective but will make the chicken a little less slippery."

          "description":"Remove the breast from the freezer and slide it off the plate onto the cutting board or use your hands to pick it up and set it down. It helps to place the breast towards the center of the cutting board. If it slides around at all, it will stay on the cutting board instead of slipping off onto the counter and potentially infecting it. If you use your hands to pick up the chicken and move it to the cutting board, don\u2019t touch anything besides the cutting board, chicken, or knife. Raw chicken can have bacteria which you don\u2019t want to spread around the kitchen. Use a separate cutting board for chicken to avoid contaminating other food."

This protects them from getting cut by the knife as you slice. For people who are prone to injury or don\u2019t trust themselves with a super sharp knife, buy a pair of cut-resistant gloves online or at a kitchen store. They\u2019re made from the same material as bulletproof vests and will keep your hands cut-free."

Make a long stroke with your knife, dragging it through the breast in one clean slice. Cutting against the grain makes your chicken more tender once it\u2019s cooked."

Depending on the width of your strips, 1 chicken breast can yield anywhere from 5 to 7 strips. Determine how wide you want your strips based on what you're using them for. Fajitas, for example, use thinner strips that are about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide whereas fried chicken strips should be cut 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide."

Look for a pair that\u2019s detachable (they may also be labeled as \u201c2-piece\u201d). With this type of scissor, you\u2019re able to take the 2 halves apart to clean between the blades.
