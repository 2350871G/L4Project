      "description":"The cost of heating your home can take a big bite out of your paycheck very quickly. (If you\u2019ve moved from a very warm or hot region, you\u2019re probably familiar with what air conditioning can do to a utility bill. This is the same; in reverse.) Add more insulation to your attic, if you have one. Heat rises, and will escape through a poorly insulated attic. Fiberglass insulation comes in rolls with paper backing that you can roll and tack up to winterize your home. Caulk cracks around windows and doors to eliminate drafts. Use water resistant caulk on the outside of buildings. Add weather stripping to doors and windows when winterizing buildings. Install outlet gaskets to electric outlets located on outer walls. The gaskets will eliminate drafts when you prepare your house for winter. Clean your furnace, if you have one, and replace the air filter. Dirty air filters clog the flow of air and could start a fire. Service your wood burning stove. Have a professional chimney sweep come out to clean and inspect your wood stove when preparing your house for winter. Close off rooms that are not in use. Try to confine areas in your home that don\u2019t require heating."

Hot pasta dishes, a stove-top stew of potatoes and chunky vegetables are great tummy warmers. (Afraid of added weight? Your body will burn those carb calories keeping you warm.
