Apply the painter\u2019s tape so that it is even with the edges of the walls, molding, and fixtures. Keep in mind that you do not need to press hard on the tape when you apply it. Using a bit of gentle pressure will be enough to keep it in place."

For example, you can. Patch cracks or holes using patching compound for plaster walls and joint compound for drywall surfaces. Spackle works well for both. Apply the compound with a putty knife and allow it to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sand patched and/or rough surfaces smooth using 220-grit sandpaper.
