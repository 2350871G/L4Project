Fill the pan or fryer with about 2 cups of vegetable or canola oil. The bottom of the cooking surface should be covered with a couple inches of oil. A deep fryer with a built-in basket will make this type of culinary project much easier, but it is not a requirement. To ensure that the bacon has the right consistency, the oil you use should be a liquid at room temperature, not a semisolid like coconut oil or shortening."

If you're working with a smaller pan or fryer, cut the strips of bacon in half before you drop them in."

The oil will continue cooking the bacon after you remove it from the fryer, so you'll want to take it out before it starts turning brown. There is no exact time it will take to fry the bacon. You'll just have to watch it closely and use your best judgment. The thickness of the bacon you're preparing may cause it to cook a little faster or slower."

You now have a mound of tasty bacon that's evenly cooked, perfectly done and ready to enjoy! Dab the bacon with a paper towel if you don't like it quite as greasy. Thick-cut bacon will have a chewier, meatier texture when deep fried than thinner slices, which will be especially crispy."
