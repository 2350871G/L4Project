Open the cold water tap for 3-5 seconds.  Make sure that your airlock is fixed!  Check the hot water at another tap.  Repeat steps 5-8 two or three times.  IF the hot water is working, switch off all taps and remove your hose.  If not, call a plumber! ! Alternative Method Disconnect the blue pipe from the back of the washing machine.
