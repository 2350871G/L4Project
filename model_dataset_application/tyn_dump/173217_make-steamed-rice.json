A rice cooker will always make a superior cooked rice. Invest in one if you plan on eating rice often. It will make your life much easier. Choose your rice carefully. Different rices work better in different dishes. Depending on what you want to use the rice for, you might want to change which rice you buy. Different rices will be drier or stickier, have different flavors, or have more or fewer nutrients. For example, basmati makes a dry final product, but jasmine will be a lot stickier. This is because of starch content. Wash your rice. Wash rice before you cook it, if you don't want it to be too sticky. This will remove some of the starch and improve the final texture. Soak the rice before cooking. Soaking your rice in warm water before you cook it will greatly improve the texture of the final product. Cover the rice in warm water and allow it to soak. Adjust the water to the rice. Long grain rices need about 1 1/2 cups of water to every cup of rice. Brown rice will need at least 2 cups of water and likely more, but short grained white rice will need less than the standard to get it perfect the first time. You should always adjust the water once you see how a new rice cooks up. Cook with spices. Before you close up the lid for your rice to steam, add in some spices to give it a little flavor, and then give it a stir. Good spice options include a slight sprinkling of celery salt, garlic powder, curry powder, or furikake.",
