          "description":"You\u2019ll need enough room to be able to get to the sides and the top of the fridge. Moving it away from counters or other appliances also protects those pieces from getting paint on them. Never paint a fridge or clean it with liquids while it's plugged into an electrical outlet. It could electrocute you. Have a friend help you if the refrigerator is too heavy to move by yourself. Empty the food in the refrigerator and the freezer into a cooler or backup fridge. Otherwise, since the refrigerator will be unplugged, the food will go bad."

If you\u2019re spraying inside, like in a workshop or the kitchen, open all of the windows and turn on the fans to help air out the room. Wearing a mask will also prevent you from inhaling all of the fumes. You'll likely need a friend or family member to help you relocate the fridge. Use a dolly to wheel it to wherever you're going to spray it."

You can buy drop cloths at a paint store or a hardware store. If you don\u2019t have a drop cloth, lay out a tarp, trash bags, or an old sheet instead. Be careful trying to lift the fridge. Ask someone to help you, or lift one corner at a time by yourself and slide the drop cloth underneath."

Use a damp cloth or microfiber towel to wipe the front, sides, and top. Let the fridge air dry. Don\u2019t brush it with a towel because that could leave lint behind, which makes paint look bumpy. Use an air compressor to dust any nooks and crannies, like the crack between the door and the fridge. This will also remove food particles. A mixture of 1 part white vinegar and 1 part water will work if you don\u2019t have soap or want a natural alternative."

Scrub gently but firmly with a medium grit sandpaper, like 180-grit, which strips away the varnish without damaging the refrigerator itself. If your fridge is already painted, you don\u2019t need to take off all of the paint. You only need to sand off the glossy finish. You can wipe the refrigerator down with a damp cloth after sanding if there\u2019s a lot of dust buildup."

          "description":"Not only does it save you from having to prime the fridge separately, it also tends to be a thicker paint. That helps avoid splatters and drips, as well as provides more coverage. If you don\u2019t use a two-in-one paint and primer, you\u2019ll have to prime the refrigerator before painting. You can buy primer at a hardware store or paint store. Choose an oil-based primer, which protects your fridge from rust. Apply 1 to 2 coats with a foam roller, letting each coat dry for 4 to 6 hours. How to Choose a Paint Color and Design\nIf you want a customizable fridge, opt for chalkboard paint. You can write your grocery list, the menu for the week, or silly doodles in chalk, then erase it and start over. For a vintage look, paint the entire fridge in a retro pastel color like pale pink or robin\u2019s egg blue. If you\u2019d like a funky pattern, use painter\u2019s tape to tape off sections in a design. For example, make a color-blocked fridge by taping a diagonal line across the front and spraying the top half in one color and the bottom half in a contrasting color. For a smudge-free fridge, avoid paint with a flat finish, which tends to show every fingerprint. Look for satin or gloss instead."

Multiple thin layers is better than 1 super thick layer, which is more prone to chipping or dripping. Saturate the roller completely by rolling it in the paint tray. This helps the paint go on smoothly without streaks. It should take each coat about 4 to 6 hours before you can paint the next one. If you don\u2019t let the paint dry completely before applying the next coat, you\u2019ll just smear and ruin the previous coat. Don\u2019t forget to paint the top of the fridge!

Clean up any mistakes, like paint that got somewhere it wasn\u2019t supposed to, with a cloth or Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol. Scrub the area to remove the paint.

Stick to a solid color or 2 complementary colors so your paint job looks professional instead of sloppy. For example, if your color scheme is navy, baby blue, and cream, paint the top half baby blue and the bottom half navy. Neutrals like white, black, gray, or chrome are always good options for a subtler effect. Avoid eggshell or matte finishes which show fingerprints and smudges."

It\u2019s also best to hold the can about 8 inches (20 cm) away from the refrigerator while you spray, just like you did for the primer. Allow each coat to dry before you apply the next coat. Shake the paint can for at least 1 minute before you start spraying to thicken it up. If you notice any drips once a coat has dried, use a piece of fine, 150 to 220 grit sandpaper to lightly sand it off. Spray paint should dry enough in 1 to 2 hours for you to apply a new coat. Wear latex gloves while spraying if you want to avoid staining your hands with the paint. Spray Paint FAQs\nWhat causes my paint to look speckled?Those pesky \u201cfreckles\u201d tend to pop up when you\u2019re painting in a spot that\u2019s too cold or too humid. Why do I keep getting drips when I spray?You\u2019re most likely spraying too close to the surface, applying coats that are too heavy, or not waiting for 1 coat to dry before spraying the next one. Also, some spray paints are simply thinner and runnier than others. Does my spray paint need to be sealed?Nope! But spraying a sealant over your paint does help protect it from everyday wear and tear."

Paint takes longer to dry in high humidity or cool temperatures. If you want to prolong the life of your paint, you can spray a protective sealant over it once the paint is dry. Apply 1 coat of sealant and let it dry for at least 72 hours. A spray enamel sealant will prevent the refrigerator from rusting."

    "Check the instructions on your can to see how long the drying time is for that specific type of paint.",

    "Leaving the primer to dry overnight will ensure it\u2019s totally dry before you start painting.",
    "Choose 1 or 2 paint colors based on the color scheme of your kitchen.",
    "Since spray paint is hard to control in a small space, tiny patterns or multicolored designs are difficult to do.",

    "Avoid eggshell or matte finishes which show fingerprints and smudges.",
    "Spray the paint in thin coats, letting each one dry completely.",
    "Instead of spraying one thick coat, spray multiple lighter layers to prevent dripping.",

    "Allow each coat to dry before you apply the next coat.",

    "Why do I keep getting drips when I spray?You\u2019re most likely spraying too close to the surface, applying coats that are too heavy, or not waiting for 1 coat to dry before spraying the next one.",
    "Also, some spray paints are simply thinner and runnier than others.",
    "Does my spray paint need to be sealed?Nope!",
    "But spraying a sealant over your paint does help protect it from everyday wear and tear.",
    "Let the paint dry for 24 hours before moving the fridge back.",
