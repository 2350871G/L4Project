  "text":" Constructing a Leyden Jar Choose a jar. You have to be careful about what materials you use to construct your Leyden jar. The material must serve as an insulator between the inner charge (+) and the outer charge (-). Choose a glass jar or a plastic bottle with a lid. If possible, get a big jar or bottle, such as one that holds 0.5 to 1 gallon (1.9 to 3.8 l). Place foil inside the jar. You will need a conductive material inside the jar in order to charge it. Traditionally, water was used inside the jar. To build a more modern Leyden jar, you should line the inside of the jar with metal foil (tin foil, aluminum foil, etc).

The foil should wrap all the way around the bottom half of the jar. The foil on the outside of the jar should not contact the foil on the inside of the jar. The outer foil will have a negative charge with respect to the inner foil. Charging a Leyden Jar Tape a styrofoam cup to a pie pan. The styrofoam cup will act as an insulator that allows you to pick up the pie pan without touching it. This will be important for charging the Leyden jar effectively. Tape the cup upside down in the center of the inside of the pie pan. The pie pan is functioning as a electro-porous, or charge carrier. Obtain a foam plate. You will use the foam plate because foam is an insulator. When you add or remove electrons from the foam, the charge will not travel. Instead, the foam will hold it's charge until the charge is dissipated by things like moisture in the air. Rub the foam plate with wool. Rub wool on the foam plate to deposit electrons onto the plate. The electrons from the wool are attracted to the foam and \u201cstick\u201d to it. This gives the foam a negative charge. You can buy a small scrap of wool at a fabric store. Touch the pie pan to the foam plate. Pick the pie pan up by touching only the styrofoam cup. Rest the pie pan on top of the foam plate.
