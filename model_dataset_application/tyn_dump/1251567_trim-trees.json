Cutting Away Large Branches Cut a 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) notch into the bottom of the branch. Measure 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) from the leader, or the main vertical stem of the tree, then place your hand or pruning saw against the underside of the branch.

If you\u2019re cutting smaller branches you don\u2019t have to cut a notch and you can use hand pruners. Cut through the branch 6 inches (15 cm) from the notch.

When transplanting a young tree, use a pair of hand pruners to snip away smaller lower hanging branches. Pruning young trees helps the root system take hold and promotes growth of their crown, or the top of the tree. Cut branches that are growing vertically or towards the leader. Use hand pruners and snip any smaller branches growing inward towards the leader. These branches rub against the tree as they grow and will damage it over time.

Pruning outgrowing branches should start as soon as you plant the tree. This will keep it aesthetically pleasing and promotes healthy growth.
