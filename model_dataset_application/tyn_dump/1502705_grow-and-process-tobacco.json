Once you see small sprouts in each cell, remove the aluminum foil cover and keep the sprouts on a windowsill so they can receive light throughout the day. Growing Tobacco Plants Indoors Pluck out half the sprouts from the cell tray with tweezers. After 2 weeks, pick out any seedlings that are growing near the edge of a cell or have grown crooked and sideways. Leave about 5 seedlings in each cell so they will not be overcrowded as they continue to grow. Transplant seedlings into pots when they are 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) tall.
