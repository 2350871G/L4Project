You have a few options:\nPlastic wrap: this wrapping material is always well suited, but might require multiple layers as moisture might get in. Plastic wrap is easy to wrap and fairly durable. Aluminum foil: this wrapping foil is probably one of the best barrier films as it's impervious to light, moisture and bacteria. One major disadvantage is that it tears very easily. Place the wrapped cake into a metallic tin, if desired. This protects the cakes from being knocked by other items, makes it very easy to find and provides added protection from moisture and freezer odors, such as seafood."
