          "description":"Add 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of food grade citric acid, 3 tablespoons (23 g) of icing sugar, and 2 tablespoons (19 g) of flavored gelatin crystals in the flavor of your choice to a small bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together well, so they\u2019re fully blended. In some parts of the world, icing sugar is also known as powdered sugar. In some parts of the world, flavored gelatin is also known as jelly crystals. Food grade citric acid is usually sold in grocery and mass merchandise stores with the canning supplies. If you can\u2019t find it in a local store, you can also order it online. The citric acid helps give the sherbet powder a sour taste to contrast with the sweetness of the sugar. It also reacts with the baking soda for a fizzy sensation. If you want sherbet powder to be more fizzy, you can add in a little more citric acid."

Make sure that you have a separate bag for each flavor of powder that you\u2019ve mixed up. You can substitute any airtight container for the plastic bag.

If you don\u2019t want to use candy to eat the powder, you can just use a plain wooden popsicle stick to dip into it. Kids often enjoy just dipping their fingers into the sherbet powder and licking it off. This recipe will make a single flavor of sherbet powder. If you want to create more than one flavor, you\u2019ll need 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, 1 teaspoon (5 g) food grade citric acid, and 3 tablespoons (23 g) of icing sugar for every 2 tablespoons (19 g) of different flavored gelatin that you plan to use."
