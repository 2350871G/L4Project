Peel 2 medium potatoes and use a sharp knife to chop each into 4 equal sized pieces. Put these chunks in the pot and cook them until they're lightly browned. You'll need to stir them occasionally to prevent them from sticking. Transfer the potatoes to a paper-towel lined plate. Pour off the oil and saut\u00e9 the onions with the garlic for 2 minutes.

Stir in the chicken pieces and cook them for 3 to 5 minutes. Nestle the chicken pieces into the onion in the pot. Cook the chicken pieces until they become slightly golden on both sides. Stir the chicken a few times to prevent sticking. Stir in the fish sauce and cook the pochero for 2 to 3 minutes. Measure 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fish sauce into the pot and cook the pochero for a few minutes to develop the flavor. Bring the tomato sauce and water to a boil over high heat. Stir the tomato sauce and water into the pochero until the mixture is combined. Turn the burner to high so the pochero comes to a boil. If you'd like a clear broth, skim off and discard any foam that floats to the top of the pot. Add the saba bananas, potatoes, chorizo, and garbanzo beans. Stir the slightly saut\u00e9ed saba bananas and potatoes into the pot. Chop 2 chorizo del bilbao into 1 inch (2.5 cm)-thick pieces and add them to the pochero along with 2 cups (330 g) of garbanzo beans. You can use cooked or canned garbanzo beans. Cover and simmer the pochero for 1 hour. Reduce the heat to medium so the liquid bubbles gently. Put the lid on the pot and let the pochero simmer until the chicken is completely cooked and tender. The chicken should reach 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C) with an instant-read thermometer once it's finished cooking. Stir in the green beans, napa cabbage, and bok choy. Add 8 to 10 trimmed green beans, the napa cabbage pieces, and the leaves from 1 bunch of bok choy. Let the veggies cook in the pochero for 3 minutes so they soften a little. Serve the chicken pochero immediately. Refrigerate the leftover pochero in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days. Creating Beef Pochero Bring water to a boil and add the beef, onion, and peppercorns. Pour 4 cups (950 ml) of water into a large pot and turn the burner to high. When the water boils, gently lower in a 4 1/2 pounds (2.0 kg) beef shank. Dice 1 onion and add it to the pot along with 2 tablespoons (17 g) of whole peppercorns. Simmer the beef over medium heat for 1 1/2 hours. Reduce the heat to medium so the water bubbles gently. Keep the lid off of the pot and let the mixture simmer until the beef is tender. If you prefer, you can make this in a pressure cooker. Pressure cook the beef pochero for 30 minutes.

Be sure to include meat, a corn cob piece, and vegetables. Store the leftover pochero in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. Making Fish Pochero Season the fish and let it rest for 15 minutes. Sprinkle 2 whole golden pompano with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Cut each fish into 4 equal pieces and put them back in the refrigerator to rest for 15 minutes. If you don't have golden pompano, you can use tilapia, tuna, or salmon. Saut\u00e9 the saba bananas and potatoes for 5 to 7 minutes. Pour 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of olive oil into a large skillet and turn the burner to medium. Use a sharp knife to cut each peeled saba banana into 3 equal sized pieces. Chop each peeled potato into 4 equal sized pieces and stir them in the skillet with the saba bananas. Cook the vegetables until they're golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked vegetables to a plate and set them aside.

Remove the fish from the refrigerator and lower each piece into the hot skillet. Cook the fish and turn it occasionally so all of the sides turn golden brown. Transfer the fried fish to a platter and set it aside. Reduce the heat and saut\u00e9 the garlic and onion for 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the burner down to medium and add 1 thinly sliced onion to the skillet. Stir in 3 cloves of minced garlic and cook the mixture for 3 to 5 minutes. The onion should soften and the garlic will become fragrant. Stir in and saut\u00e9 the green beans for 1 minute. Chop 15 green beans into 2 in (5.1-cm) long pieces and add them to the skillet. Stir and cook the green beans until they become slightly browned. Bring the water, tomato sauce, and ketchup to a boil. Stir 1 cup (240 ml) of water, 1 cup (225 g) of tomato sauce, and \u00bc cup (55 g) of banana ketchup into the skillet. Turn the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and stir in the sugar and fish sauce. Turn the heat down to medium so the pochero bubbles gently. Stir in 1 tablespoon (12.5 g) of sugar and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of fish sauce. Let the mixture cook for 3 minutes so the sugar dissolves. Stir in the kidney beans and bok choi and simmer it for 3 minutes. Add 1 cup (185 g) of canned or cooked kidney beans into the pochero along with the chopped pechay (bok choy). Let the pochero bubble gently for 3 minutes so the pechay softens. Simmer the fish in the pochero for 3 minutes. Transfer the saut\u00e9ed fish to the skillet and let it cook over medium heat. Scoop the cooked fish into serving dishes so each dish has an equal number of fish pieces. Stir the saut\u00e9ed saba bananas and potatoes into the pochero. Turn off the burner and transfer the saba bananas and potatoes to the skillet. Stir the mixture well to coat the vegetables in the sauce. Serve the fish with pochero and cooked rice. Spoon the sauce over the fish pieces in the serving bowls. Ensure that you include chunks of potato and saba bananas in each bowl. Serve the pochero along with hot, cooked rice.
