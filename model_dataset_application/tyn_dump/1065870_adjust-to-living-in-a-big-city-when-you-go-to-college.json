      "headline":"Choose where to live.",
      "description":"Have you decided if you are going to live on campus or off campus? Regardless of what decision you make, there are a lot of choice that go with it. If you are going to be living on campus, you have to think about living with other people, sharing all of your stuff, and especially sharing your personal space. If you decide that you are going to be living off campus, you must consider if you are again going to live with roommates, or if you are going to front the bill yourself. If you do live by yourself, it will be harder to adjust to the city if you are alone all the time."

      "headline":"Budget your Money.",
      "description":"The biggest stress of moving to a large city is how it seems like you are spending money on things you never did before. Try to really make sure you budget your money. Don\u2019t get caught up in spending because everyone else is."

      "headline":"Get a Job.",
      "description":"Getting a job in the city is actually easier than getting a job in your small town. In a small town, there is not that many jobs to come by, and usually you are in that job for many years. Now there is a really fast turnover rate for many places. The biggest place to go to find a part time job is the nearest mall."

Try it with a bunch of friends during the day if it\u2019s your first time ever. It does get easier as your experience it more. Your own car. You might not need your own car when you move to the city. Usually you have to drive quite a distance to get to the nearest store, but now they are all going to be in walking distance, or at least most of them are. And like it as said before, there is even public transportation to get you places. You can save a lot of money by not taking your car with you. You will lose out of coming home as often without a car though."

You might be gone for a week, and it seems like forever. Going home is sometimes the most exciting part of your week! You will get to eat some great home cooked food, do free laundry, and sleep in your own bed. It\u2019s a wonderful sensation."

      "description":"Making friends is quite possibly the hardest part about moving to a large city. At home, you knew the name of everyone in your school, possibly even their parents, grandparents, and other relative\u2019s names. You have had the same teacher as all your siblings, and maybe even your parents. Now you move to a city and you might meet one person one day and never see them again. Try to be friendly and nice to everyone you meet, you never know when you are going to see them again, and if you do, it\u2019s best to leave a good impression. To make more friends, be outgoing, go to places you wouldn\u2019t normally go, eat foods you\u2019ve never tried, and be adventurous. You will never make friends if you sit at home all the time; you have to put yourself out there, even if it makes you out of your comfort zone."
