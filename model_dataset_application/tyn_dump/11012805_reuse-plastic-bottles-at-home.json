In particular, coffee creamer bottles come with caps that make pouring quite easy. Make sure to check the number inside of the triangle at the bottom of plastic bottles before using them to store food.

          "description":"You can make a pencil and pen organizer for your desk with very little effort. First, use a knife to cut the plastic bottle to your desired length by cutting it in half. Then, use a pair of scissors to trim any sharp or rough edges. Lastly, you can use a steam iron to heat the edges a little bit and smooth them out, although sandpaper also works. You can paint or decorate the bottle to give it a personal touch! Be careful when heating the edges of a bottle with a steam iron. Use the lowest possible setting or you\u2019ll warp the plastic. Half the height of a standard 16 oz. water bottle works well for pen and pencil storage, but you\u2019ll want to cut higher for longer materials like paintbrushes, or pipe cleaners."

Then, play around with different patterns by placing them together on a foam board or blank canvas. Once you\u2019ve found an image or pattern that you like, you can glue the bottle caps to your material with hot glue or collage sealer. You may want to put newspaper under your canvas or board so that you don\u2019t make a mess. You can sand down the top of the lids if you\u2019re having trouble keeping them attached to your board or canvas.

Once you have several lines of bottles strung together, you can tie them together and hang them over an enclosed light source to make a chandelier.

Use a drill or knife to create an opening in the center of each plastic section. Take any length of metal rod and, starting with the biggest section of plastic, carefully insert each portion of bottle through the rod vertically to make a jewelry stand. You can use nuts and washers to keep each section firmly in place if the rod is threaded. You can mix colors if you\u2019d like to make your jewelry holder match a color scheme."

Whether you\u2019re priming a fresh canvas or touching up the trim in a freshly painted room, repurposing a bottle as a paint tray or easel is easy enough. If the bottle\u2019s opening is too small to dip your brush into, simply cut an opening of 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) in to the side of the bottle on the opposite side of the handle and make one. Many people prefer using a bottle like this to a purchasable paint tray because the sharp edge left by your cut makes it easy to get excess paint off of your brush. To remove excess paint with the edge, simply press your bristles in to the edge while pulling your brush out and you\u2019ll see the excess paint drip nicely back into the rest of the paint in the bottle."
