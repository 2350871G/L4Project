Lightly press one of the strawberries with your thumb to test for firmness. If the strawberries are too soft, they will be hard to shape. The more uniform they are, the better your flowers will look. Wash and dry your strawberries before you make your flowers. You'll also need at least one skewer to hold the strawberry while you cut your petals into it. For cutting, use a small paring knife. Sharpen the knife before you begin for the best results."

Depending on the size of your strawberry, you should be able to get four to six of these petals circling around the bottom of your strawberry. After you make your incisions, use the flat of the knife to slightly bend each petal outwards, so it curls like a flower. As you cut, be careful to only cut into the strawberry slightly. Avoid removing any part of it."

For even more decadence and a geometric look, dip your strawberry flowers completely in chocolate. Melt chocolate chips or chopped up chocolate over a double boiler or in low power increments in the microwave. Stir often. To temper the chocolate, add a few extra pieces of solid chocolate to your melted chocolate and stir them in until they melt. To create an even drizzle, spoon your melted chocolate into a plastic sandwich bag. Cut off a tiny bit of one corner of the bag. Squeeze the chocolate onto your strawberry in this hole in the bag as though you are piping icing. Lay out your strawberries on wax paper to let the chocolate harden so that it doesn't become messy or smudged."

For a touch of class, add single edible sugar pearls in the petals of your strawberries. You can find these at most grocery stories in the confectionary aisle. To add these pearls to your strawberries, use a dot of melted white chocolate as a kind of edible glue. Simply dip one side of the pearl in the chocolate, and then place it on one of the petals of your strawberry. Don't move the strawberries until this chocolate dries."

You can use stems from plastic flowers for a reusable option or cut the stems off of fresh flowers. For fresh stems, take a sharp knife to create a 45-degree angle on each of your stems. This will help them glide easily into the strawberries. Carefully stick your stems into the base of your strawberries where the skewers were. Only push them in far enough that the flowers feel secure. You don't want the stem to protrude from the top of your strawberry flower. Place your finished flowers in a vase of your choice to serve. If you don't want to use stems, you can also dye your skewers green. Mix some green food coloring and water in a large dish like a roasting pan. Then, lay all your skewers in the pan, and leave them to dye for 30 minutes. Lay them out on a paper towel to dry."
