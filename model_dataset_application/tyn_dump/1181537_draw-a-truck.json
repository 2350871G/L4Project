The rectangle will serve as the entire length of the truck. This is only the foundation of the truck drawing. The lines will be modified and erased as the picture progresses. Draw two circles to be the wheels. One is drawn near the front and one near the back. The two circles should be the same size. Because this is the side view, only two tires are seen.

Erase any lines from the initial rectangle that are visible inside of the \"u\" shape. Apply a hood to the front of the truck by making the piece of the rectangle in front of the cab a rounded line curving downward to meet the side of the rectangle.  Form a side window by making a shape in the cab. The shape will look like a trapezoid on the half nearest the front of the truck (have a slanted side). The back half of the shape should be a rectangle (have a straight side). Add a mirror by creating a semi-circle near the bottom of the side of the window nearest the front of the truck. The flat part of the semi-circle should face the back of the truck and the rounded part face the front of the truck. Create a door handle by placing a small rectangle under the window toward the bed of the truck.  Draw a line straight down from the back of the cab to the bottom of the original long rectangle. This line will separate the cab section from the bed of the truck. Add another line from the front of the cab down to the bottom of the truck. This will form the door. Add any additional details that you wish. A gas tank cover, stripes, decals and other details are optional. Paint, color, or add shading to the truck. ",
