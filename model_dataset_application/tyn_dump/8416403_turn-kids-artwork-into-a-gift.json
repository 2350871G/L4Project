          "description":"If you decide to simply present the original artwork as a gift, feel free to use any size paper (or, if using paint, a literal canvas) that you like. However, for many of these projects, you\u2019ll be scanning the finished artwork to your computer. If you decide on one of these, use paper that will fit your scanner. Also:\nBe aware that changing the size of your scanned image may alter the image itself. For example, shrinking your child\u2019s 8.5 x 11-inch self-portrait to fit a small canvas pouch may cause facial features to condense and blur together. Conversely, blowing up a smaller picture to cover a larger dishtowel may cause the blown-up image to appear pixelated. To avoid this, use paper that roughly matches the surface area of the item that it will be transferred to. Or, simply trim larger sheets of paper down to size with scissors."

          "description":"Again, if you intend to give the original artwork as a gift, this is less of a concern. However, for artwork that needs to be scanned and transferred, consider the dimensions of the item that it will be transferred to. If the item is wider than it is long, instruct your kids to orient their paper accordingly. For example, if you\u2019re going to iron your transfer onto a small wide pouch, you\u2019ll most likely want a horizontal image to cover as much surface area as possible."

          "description":"Of course, if you want to, give your kids free rein to draw or paint whatever they choose. But also consider instructing them to draw appropriate subjects for the occasion. Ask them to create a custom image that ties directly into the occasion and/or the recipient for a more personalized gift. For example:\nIf the occasion is a birthday, they could draw a party scene with cake and balloons. For holidays like Christmas or Hannukah, have them draw a Christmas tree or a menorah. For relatives like grandparents, aunts, and uncles, ask each child to draw a family portrait, or make it a group project with each family member drawing themselves."

However, if you\u2019re going to use it to decorate another item (or present copies of one image to more than one recipient), scan the artwork to your computer. Once scanned, crop, minimize, or otherwise edit the image to your liking and save the file. If you don\u2019t have a scanner, you can either use a smartphone or digital camera to take photos instead.

If you\u2019re fairly sure of where the recipient will hang it, choose a colored matte that will match that room\u2019s color scheme and/or other matted artwork.

For each one, print your scanned artwork onto an 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of plain vellum paper (a translucent form of paper that will allow plenty of light to shine through it). Cut away the excess paper, wrap the image around the holder, and tape the ends together where they meet. Measure the holder\u2019s dimensions before your kids create the artwork. This way you can give them appropriately sized paper to draw on. This helps eliminate the need to alter the size of the image after scanning. It also saves you from wasting printer ink on larger images that will need to be trimmed down to size. For a more seamless look, add an extra inch to the width of the vellum paper when cutting out the image. This way you can overlap the ends when wrapping them and then use double-sided tape between them so the tape is out of view."

Trace an outline of the book on the back of the artwork, with an added border of a half-inch (1.25 cm) along each side. In the top and bottom borders, draw a vertical line at each corner of the spine. Remove the book and cut the outline out with scissors. Then:\nRub the entire surface area of both covers, plus the spine of the journal, with a clear glue stick.

Fold the border\u2019s corners over those of the journals and press it firmly to the inside of the covers. Then do the same with the edges.
