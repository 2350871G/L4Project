You can also find special molds for making stepping stones in an arts and crafts store. The mold needs to be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick. If the edges of your mold are not rigid, then you will need to use something to reinforce them until the concrete hardens. This usually takes about 24 hours."

Wash your hands with mild vinegar followed by hand soap and water to reduce irritation to your skin if you get concrete on it. Avoid getting dry or wet concrete in your eyes.
