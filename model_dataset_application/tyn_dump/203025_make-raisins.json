Spread the grapes so that they aren\u2019t touching one another on the tray. Use a kitchen towel to cover the grapes. You can also use a pillowcase to cover your grapes if you\u2019d rather not use a kitchen towel. Your cover should also be effective at keeping insects away from your grapes as they dry.

Only put them out during warm, dry weather; the warmer and dryer the climate, the easier your grapes will dry out. If you put your tray out in overcast, cool, or particularly humid weather, the grapes will take longer to dry out (and may not even completely dry out). Aim to put your tray outside when the forecast is sunny, humidity is not too high, and the temperature is at least 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C). If your area gets foggy or dewy at night, take the tray inside at the end of the day and place it outside again the next morning."

However, they should be left outside for at least 3 days. Go out and rotate the grapes twice each day to make sure both sides of the grapes are exposed to the sun. After 3 days, feel free to conduct a taste test on 1 or 2 of the grapes to see if they\u2019re sufficiently dry. If they\u2019re to your liking, go ahead and bring them inside. If they\u2019re not quite dry enough, leave them out for another day. You can leave grapes out in the sun for up to 5 days, though you shouldn\u2019t need to leave them out any longer than this."
