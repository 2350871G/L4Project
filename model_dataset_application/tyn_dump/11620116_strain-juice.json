Take the strainer and put it on top of a bowl or pitcher with tall sides so your juice doesn\u2019t drip over the sides. You can buy fine-mesh strainers from kitchen or restaurant supply stores. If the strainer doesn\u2019t fit over the pitcher without hanging over the sides, set a funnel on top of the pitcher first before putting the bowl on it."

Apply firm pressure to the pulp to drain out as much juice as you\u2019re able to before throwing the pulp away. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, or you could break through the strainer.Tip: Stir the leftover pulp every 1\u20132 minutes to ensure that you press out as much liquid as possible."
