          "description":"Take 1 pound (454 g) of elbow macaroni or another tube-shaped pasta, and place it in a large bowl. Pour enough hot water over the pasta to cover it, and add salt to taste to season the mixture. Let the pasta rest in the water while you work with other ingredients. Hot water should reach a temperature between 130 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 57 degrees Celsius). It should be too hot to touch comfortably. While you should let the pasta sit in the water, make sure to stir it twice during the first 10 minutes that it's soaking. That will keep the macaroni from sticking together."

          "description":"Pour 2 28-ounce (794 g) cans of whole peeled tomatoes into the pitcher of a traditional blender or into a bowl that you can fit a hand blender into. Blend the tomatoes until they are almost entirely smooth and then set aside for use later. If you don't have a blender, you can use a potato masher to pulverize the tomatoes into a thick, smooth puree."

          "description":"In a Dutch oven or 5 quart (4.7 L) saute pan with straight sides, place 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter, and heat on medium-high. Swirl the pan regularly until the butter is almost completely melted. While the combination of olive oil and butter usually provides the best flavor, you can use only one if you prefer. For example, opt for 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of olive oil or 4 tablespoons (56 g) of unsalted butter."

          "headline":"Sautee the onion and pepper until softened.",
          "description":"Once the olive oil and butter are heated, add 1 large onion and 1 large green pepper, both finely diced, to the pan. Continue heating the onion and pepper over medium heat until they are softened but aren't browned. It should take approximately 7 minutes. While the onion and pepper are heating in the pan, make sure to stir them frequently so all of the pieces cook evenly."

          "headline":"Add garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and half of the parsley to the pot and cook.",

Allow the ingredients to cook for approximately 1 minute until the mixture becomes fragrant. Make sure to stir the contents of the pot while you're cooking them for that minute so nothing sticks to the bottom and it all cooks evenly."

Use a wooden spoon to break the beef into small pieces and cook it on medium-high heat until it is no longer pink, which should take approximately 4 to 7 minutes.

Allow it to cook until the macaroni is nearly cooked through, which should take approximately 5 minutes. If you don't have a lid for your pot, you can press a sheet of foil over it or lay a cookie sheet across the top. To know how long the pasta should cook, consult the package's instructions. You should cook it for approximately half the recommended cooking time. You can also finish off the dish in the oven. Make the sauce as directed above, but add the Worcestershire sauce to it directly and leave out the chicken stock. Cook the macaroni halfway, and mix with the sauce and half of the mozzarella in a casserole dish. Top with the rest of the mozzarella and half of the Parmesan.

Make sure to stir the contents of the pot while you're cooking them for that minute so nothing sticks to the bottom and it all cooks evenly. Combining the Beef, Tomatoes, and Pasta Crumble the ground beef in the pot and brown. Push the onion and pepper mixture to the side of the pot to make room, and add 1 pound (454 g) of ground beef.
