If you are cleaning grout haze off of tiles that have recently been installed, wait a day for the grout to set. This will allow the grout to firm up so it is not damaged when you are removing the grout haze. This is key if you have smooth tiles made of glazed ceramic or porcelain. Talk to the professional floor installer to find out the setting time for the grout. Most cement and ready-mixed grouts dry within 24 hours."

Get a cheesecloth that is designed for cleaning grout haze at your local hardware store or online. Rub the surface of the tiles with the dry cheesecloth to remove the haze. You may need an extra pair of hands to help you rub the tiles with the cheesecloth, especially if you are removing grout haze off a large area."

Wet the terry towel and wring out as much water as you can before you use it. This will ensure excess water does not get on the grout. Then, rub the damp terry cloth over the tiles to remove the grout haze. You can also try swiping a damp terry cloth over the grout haze to wet it.

Then, use a mop or a nylon scrubber to spread the cleaner and remove the grout haze. Make sure you use a scrub pad that is soft and made of nylon.
