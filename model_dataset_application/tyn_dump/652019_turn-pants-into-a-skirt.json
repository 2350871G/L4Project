If the pants are too big, you'll need to rip up the side seam, cut out the unnecessary fabric, and sew it back together to match your waistline."

As long as it's a clean line, it doesn't matter what angle it's at. In fact, a steeper angle can give your skirt a more refined, less patched-together look. If you want to use the legs for the rest of your skirt (right now it's too short), don't throw them away just yet!"

Or you can use the pant leg of the ones you just tore up. Does the thigh or the calf give you the width you'd like? Cut 1/2\" (1.25 cm) wide than you need for a seam allowance. Make sure the fabric is long enough to wrap around the entirety of the skirt. If you're using your old jeans, you may need to rip out the seam that meets the skirt -- otherwise that's a lot of thread going on in one place. And because of the cut of the jean, make sure the fabric lines up (width-wise) front and back."

Flip the skirt inside out and begin either hand stitching or blazing through with a sewing machine. If your fabric requires it, create a seam on the bottom edge, too. Just don't make it too short!

You can cut off some of excess material (length-wise) right now if you'd like, or you can just sew it all and adjust for length later. But if you'd like a slit, don't sew up the back all the way! Your backstitch should be as close to the edge as possible -- you can follow the seam line that's already there. You can do this either by hand or with a machine, no problem.

If the skirt is bigger than you, take a skirt that fits you and lay it on top. Then, cut your pants-skirt to that size, leaving 1\" on each side for a seam allowance.

You may also need to pull at the fabric a little to keep it taut and straight. Then try it on! You can adjust for length once you see how it fits your body."

Cut it at the desired length, create your edge, and you're done! You have two main options here: you can either hem it, creating a clean, finished edge, or you can cut and fray it, sticking with the distressed look. If you do choose to hem it, fold under 1/2\" (1.25 cm) of material and sew along the edges. Do the same for your slit, if applicable."

    "Pin the sides and sew.",
    "Each side needs a good pinning (up and down both sides) to make it easier on you for sewing and to assure a straight line.",
    "If you're working with denim, make sure you're using denim thread.",
    "Don't have denim thread?",
    "Then use cotton thread and go over it twice.",
    "Again, if you're using denim, sew very slowly.",
    "You may also need to pull at the fabric a little to keep it taut and straight.",
    "Then try it on!",
    "You can adjust for length once you see how it fits your body.",
    "Cut it to length and create your edge.",
    "Once you've tried it on, find out where you'd like it to hit your leg.",
    "Pin it, take it off, and you're almost there!",
    "Cut it at the desired length, create your edge, and you're done!",
    "You have two main options here: you can either hem it, creating a clean, finished edge, or you can cut and fray it, sticking with the distressed look.",
    "If you do choose to hem it, fold under 1/2\" (1.25 cm) of material and sew along the edges.",
    "Do the same for your slit, if applicable."
