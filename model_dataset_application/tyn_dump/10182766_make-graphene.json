Alternatively, you can purchase powdered graphite at your local department or home improvement store for about $10.00 for 6 ounces (170 g). Use tweezers to place a small amount of the powder onto the piece of paper. A pinch would be too much."

After about 20 times of peeling, you should end up with a layer of graphite that is only 1 atom thick. This is graphene. If you are using fresh pieces of tape, rather than folding, place the third piece of tape on top of the second piece; the fourth piece of tape on top of the third, and so on."

If you used the same piece of tape folded on top of itself multiple times, you will notice that some spots will be darker and some will be lighter. The lighter spots are the thinnest layers and the lightest spot is the graphene. If you used fresh pieces of tape to peel layers each time, use your final piece of tape (about the 20th piece) to place under the microscope."

Without lab equipment, it is difficult to distinguish between actual flakes of graphene and small flakes of graphite. In general, if the graphene particles are too big (still graphite), they will sink to the bottom of the blender; if they are smaller, they will float to the top.
