In addition to the gear, work in an area that is relatively well ventilated to avoid excessive gas build up. Prepare the mold. Before proceeding, the mold should be sprayed with a material that allows the part to separate from the mold once it is finished. These materials are usually a specialized type of wax that does not interfere with the curing process of the part. You can order a mold lubricant online or buy one from a carbon fiber retailer. The wax is not to be confused with the resin. The wax creates a layer between the mold and the resin, and does not harden. Spray the inside with resin. For best results, make sure that all nooks and crannies of the mold are completely saturated with the resin. Depending on the size of the mold, you may need multiple cans of resin This will create the surface needed to apply the carbon fiber. Unlike the wax, the resin will harden and be removed from the mold as part of the carbon fiber piece. Laying the Carbon Fiber Apply the fiber cloth. Quickly press sheets of carbon fiber cloth into the mold. As with applying the resin, make sure you completely cover all sections of the interior mold with the fiber cloth.
