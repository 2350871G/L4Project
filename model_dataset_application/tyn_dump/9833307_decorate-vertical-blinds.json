If you have vinyl blinds, choose a spray paint that is multi-surface. If your blinds are made of fabric, choose a fabric spray paint. Consider spraying inside or around a stencil to create a pattern or random touches throughout the blinds."

Lay the blinds down next to each other on a drop cloth and secure them on the top and bottom with painters tape to make sure they are aligned. Start at the top of the blinds and move down as you fill in the stencil. Don't put too much paint on your paintbrush. Using a little paint at a time will allow you to better control the amount that ends up on the blinds. Use dabbing motions with the brush instead of stroking to prevent streaking."

  "text":" Painting the Blinds Take the blinds down. You will want to be able to lay the blinds down on a flat surface like a drop cloth on the floor. You may also want to take the blinds outside to prevent your house from getting dirty. Most vertical blinds unhook from the top individually. Wash the blinds with soap and water and let them dry. Use a sponge or washcloth to clean the front and back side of each blind panel. You want to make sure any dust and dirt is removed before applying paint. Wipe down the blinds with a dry towel and lay them flat until completely dry. Use spray paint for a quick paint job. Buy a paint from a local crafts or home improvement store. Hang up the blinds outside with clothespins or nails. Spray both sides of each blind with a thin layer and let dry before applying 1 or 2 more coats. Wear a mask over your nose and mouth so you don't breathe in the fumes from the paint. If you have vinyl blinds, choose a spray paint that is multi-surface.

Using a little paint at a time will allow you to better control the amount that ends up on the blinds. Use dabbing motions with the brush instead of stroking to prevent streaking. Using Drapes and Curtains Use drapes to create a darker, formal feeling. Choose drapes that have a liner if you want to block out a lot of light. Select a drape that comes with extra fabric that hangs from the curtain for an even more extravagant look. If you want to give your room a luxurious vibe, opt for drapes that are made of velvet and sateen in dark red, brown, and black. Use curtains to give a casual, flowing mood to the room. Choose varieties made of cotton, linen, and wool. These materials will make the colors look extra vibrant as the sun shines through.

However, if you want your window to appear taller, consider hanging them higher than this. Consider having the curtains hang about 3 in (7.6 cm) to 6 in (15 cm) beyond either side of the window frame. Mount the curtain rod using your marks as a guide. Follow the instructions that come with the rods to mount the rod and hang the curtains. Curtain rods come in many shapes, sizes, and supplies to hang. You will usually use a drill and screws to mount the curtain rod holder. Use accessories to dress up the blinds even more. Use a napkin ring to bunch the curtain or window scarf to the side and out of the way during the day. Pull the curtain through the napkin ring until it has reached half-way up the curtain. You can also choose to use a window scarf for a soft touch. Make one loop around the center of the curtain rod where both curtains meet in the middle. Drape either end of the scarf around the ends of the curtain rod. Making and Decorating Cornices Choose an upholstered cornice for a stylish, casual look. You can make this on your own and control which fabric colors and patterns end up on the piece. If you want to add a subtle touch to the blinds, consider using a color that is either a few shades lighter or darker than the wall color. For a dash of style, opt for a fun pattern to spice up the window. Choose a polished or natural wood cornice to create a neutral feel. Opt for an outside mount wood cornice as these styles have enough space between the window frame and cornice board. Measure and cut the boards for the cornice. Use a measuring tape to measure the width of the window for the front board and two side board pieces. For the front board, measure from one outside edge of the trim to the other and add 4 in (10 cm). Measure and cut 2 side pieces 5 in (13 cm) each. Measure and cut 2 wood blocks. Each block should be 5 in (13 cm) by 3.5 in (8.9 cm) each. These blocks will be used to hang the board on the wall. Attach the two side pieces to the front board using a screwdriver and screws. Align the 5 in (13 cm) side of one of the side pieces under the end of the front board. Drill a pilot hole through the corner of the front board into the top of the side piece. Repeat this with the other side piece on the opposite side of the front board. Drill pilot holes in each corner of the front board into the side pieces. Use a screwdriver to screw in screws into the 4 pilot holes you\u2019ve drilled. Prepare your supplies to wrap the front of the board. Measure the batting and fabric so there is extra left over on either side of both of the side pieces. Iron the fabric before attaching it to the board. Place the fabric face down on a flat surface. Lay the batting on top aligning the edges to the fabric. Place the board front side down on the batting and fabric, keeping in mind the pattern on the front side of the fabric is centered. Wrap the front of the board using a staple gun. Fold the fabric over the top of the board and staple in the middle, pulling the fabric taught. Keep pulling the fabric over the top and stapling every 1 in (2.5 cm) until the top of board is all stapled. Fold the fabric over the bottom of the board, staple in the middle, and then every 1 in (2.5 cm). Make sure the fabric is taught on the front of the board and the pattern is aligned.
