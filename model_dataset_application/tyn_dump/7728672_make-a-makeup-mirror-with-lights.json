Find two extension cords, scissors, and picture hanging strips (the ones with adhesive that pull off). You may need to go to a hardware or lighting store for vanity light bars and light bulbs.

Depending on which light bars you purchase, you'll see holes for screws in several places. Use a screw driver or a drill to secure the light bar to your mirror. Your vanity light bars will probably come with the screws you need to attach the bars."

Make a 1/4 inch cut at the end of the cord where you just removed the adapter. You should cut in between the two thin cords that are connected."

Use your scissors to cut just the plastic covering the copper wire about an inch from the end. Once you've made the cut, slide the plastic off the end so you see the copper wire. Do this for both of the wires on both sets of extension cords. Take care not to cut into the copper wire while you're cutting away the plastic covering."

Take one plastic wire nut and firmly place it onto the exposed copper wire that you just twisted. Twist the wire nut until it's affixed securely. Repeat this for each connection between the light bar and extension cord wires so that all the copper wire ends are covered. The wire nuts are necessary to securely connect the wire and reduce the likelihood of electrical fires, so it's important to use them."

Set the cover back onto the vanity light bar so that all the cords are covered.When doing this, try to keep the white and black wires separate from each other within the light bar. Separating the cords can prevent the cords from touching, which can cause the circuit breaker to trip, or even cause a fire."

Screw one light bulb into each electrical socket so that it's firmly in place. Plug the extension cords into power outlets and turn on your vanity lights. If you're using a wireless remote control, you may need to follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding setup."

          "description":"Mark the back of the mirror where you'd like to screw in hardware. Some mirrors already come with hooks attached to the back, so you simply need to hang the mirror on the wall. Measure the distance between the hooks. Measure the same distance on the wall where you're hanging the mirror and make a small mark. Use a drill to attach hardware (like a wall anchor or screw) to the wall so you can hang your mirror. Make sure you weigh the mirror and use hardware that supports that weight. Otherwise, your makeup mirror may damage your wall or fall down."
