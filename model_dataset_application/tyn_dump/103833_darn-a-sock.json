You can also use a dark color for horizontal stitching and a lighter color for vertical stitching. If you have a dark sock, using white thread will help you to see what you\u2019re doing more easily. Same goes for a white sock and dark thread. It doesn't have to match exactly; unless you are a foot model, not too many people will see your sock-covered feet."

You will want to thread the needle with one or two strands of thread, depending on the weight of the sock. As you may have guessed, if it is a thicker sock you will want to use a thicker thread (or two pieces of thread.) Tie a knot in the end of the thread. You will begin by sewing from the inside of the sock, out, so that your knot is on the inside of your sock."

If you don\u2019t have a darning egg or don\u2019t want to buy one, you can pretty much use anything that is round. A tennis ball works well, as does a lightbulb, so long as you are very careful. You can also just use your other hand; stick it in the sock like you would your foot. This last option will make darning your sock a bit more difficult."

You can also choose to sew a running stitch for a few rows above and to either side of the hole. Doing this reinforces the sewing you will be doing to close the hole up and supports the thread around the hole (which is probably pretty thin and on the verge of forming a hole itself.)"
