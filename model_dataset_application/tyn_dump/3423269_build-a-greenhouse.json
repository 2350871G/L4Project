    "Untreated wood can degrade in as little as 3 years.",
    "Choose your wood treatment carefully.",
    "Some wood treatments require that the food is no longer listed as \u201corganic\u201d or safe for consumption because of the use of chemicals.",
    "Consider a treatment like Erdalith, which has limited leaching properties.",
    "Use metal supports in place of wood supports whenever possible.",
    "Seal the covering to the frame as closely as you can.",
    "You may be able to simply bolt film to wood.",
    "The more expensive the covering, such as glass, fiberglass, or double walled plastic, the more time you should take to seal it to the foundation and frame.",
    "Research the best procedure for the covering of your choice.",
    "Controlling Temperature Place fans in the corners of the greenhouse.",
    "Set up fans so that they are diagonal and create a airflow.",
    "They should run almost constantly during the winter months, to ensure the entire greenhouse is benefiting from the heater.",
    "Install vents in the ceiling of your greenhouse.",
    "They can also be located near the top of the supports.",
    "Some ventilation of carbon dioxide is essential.",
    "The vents should be adjustable.",
    "You will need to open them wider in the summer months.",
    "Consider installing an electric heater.",
    "Solar heat may only account for 25 percent of the heat in your greenhouse, so a backup heater is essential.",
    "You can also use a wood or oil-based heater, but it must be vented to the outside to ensure good air quality, carbon dioxide poising is a real danger to be looked out for in such a close space.",
    "You should check with your town or council to see what heating options are available in your area.",
    "Install a forced-air system, if you are using a glass-frame greenhouse.",
    "If you can afford to outfit your greenhouse with its own temperature control system, then you can set it up to grow almost anything.",
    "Employ an electrician and a contractor to install your system.",
    "It may need regular maintenance to ensure it can handle ventilation and heating in the winter.",
    "Install thermometers or thermostats.",
    "You should install several thermometers in case 1 breaks.",
    "Place them at different levels of the greenhouse so that you can observe the temperature in your greenhouse at all times.",
    "You can buy a thermometer that measures the temperature inside your house and inside your greenhouse, so that you can watch it closely during the winter months.",
    "Additional Greenhouse Planning Study planting conditions for the plants you want to grow.",
    "The more sensitive the plant is to changes in heat, the less likely you will be able to grow other plants in the same section.",
    "A cool house is a greenhouse designed to keep plants from freezing.",
    "It is ideal for temporary greenhouses.",
    "A hot house is a greenhouse designed to keep plants in tropical temperatures.",
    "You will need to choose what the temperature will be and keep it steady.",
    "It is not possible to create different zones in an open greenhouse.",
    "Ensure you have a steady water supply.",
    "Ideally it should be supplied by hose water and cisterns.",
    "Construct raised beds inside your greenhouse.",
    "Slatted tables can be used in the meantime, since they will allow water to drain through the table and into the gravel.",
    "If possible, construct the beds to the primary gardener\u2019s height to limit ergonomic problems."
