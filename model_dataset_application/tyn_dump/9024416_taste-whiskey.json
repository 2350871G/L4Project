Bring the glass up directly beneath your nose and allow the aromas to drift up. Don\u2019t breathe in deeply; let the scents come to you. The initial scent of the whiskey will have a strong alcohol scent. By letting the whiskey\u2019s aroma drift up to you, you give your nose time to adjust to the amount of alcohol in it. Otherwise, your nose may feel like it\u2019s burning. Keep your mouth open as you sniff the whiskey to experience a more powerful aroma."

Be careful not to spill any of the whiskey, and raise the glass up in a straight line while you smell it. You should be able to take in the aromas of the heavier compounds that are usually at the bottom of the glass. The heavier compounds in the whiskey typically have woody, smoky, and earthy aromas."

The first few times that you try this technique, it may make you feel like gagging. That's usually due to how strong the whiskey is -- the burning sensation that it provides can make you cough, which can trigger your gag reflex. Don\u2019t try to look for any particular flavors; just see what notes you detect."

Don\u2019t do it too quickly or you may not be able to pick up all of the whiskey\u2019s flavors. Overall, you should hold the whiskey in your mouth for about 30 seconds before you swallow it to really take in all of its flavors. You'll likely taste woodsy and spicy flavors when you first take in the flavor. Depending on the type of whiskey, you may also taste hints of citrus, nuttiness, caramel, and other flavors."

The burning feeling that you experience as it goes down is known as the finish. Try to notice exactly how it feels -- it could be short, long, mellow, or unpleasant, depending on your alcohol tolerance. A short finish doesn't linger long in the mouth so the flavor disappears quickly. A long finish lingers in the mouth so the flavor stays with you after you swallow the whiskey. A mellow finish has a smooth, pleasant flavor. An unpleasant finish may have a bitter flavor or burn as it goes down."

Be sure to use room-temperature water, though, so differences in temperature don\u2019t affect the whiskey\u2019s taste. Mix still or flat water into your whiskey, not carbonated or sparkling."

Use a pipette or a straw to add just 1 drop at a time so you don\u2019t wind up diluting the whiskey rather than opening it up. If you don\u2019t have a pipette or straw, you can use the cap from your bottle of water to add a small amount at a time. If you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re picking up any new aroma or flavors from the whiskey after adding a drop of water, you can add another."

During this time, the water slowly changes the flavor of the whiskey, which will allow you to notice more of a difference when you taste the whiskey again. Adding the water to the whiskey can help bring out subtle flavors that you didn't pick up when it was neat. For example, you may be able to taste citrus notes or a nutty flavor that you didn't detect at first tasting. The water can also help tone down the alcohol taste of the whiskey, so if it had an unpleasant finish, you may find that you like it better with the water."
