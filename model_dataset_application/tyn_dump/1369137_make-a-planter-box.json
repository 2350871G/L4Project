Use a straight edge or angle square to mark a straight line where you want to cut with a carpentry pencil. 4 of these pieces will make the longer sides of your box, while 2 of them will serve as the base. The size of your sides will determine how long the length of your box will be. A length of 3 feet (0.91 m) is good for a medium-sized box that will fit 3-5 smaller plants. You can use pine, spruce, or fir, but cedar is generally more durable and is better at handling intense weather over long periods of time. Use pressure-treated wood if you don\u2019t plan on eating anything that comes out of your planter box, since it will hold up better over time. You don\u2019t want the chemicals used to pressure-treat wood seeping into any fruits, vegetables, or spices that you\u2019re growing, so don\u2019t use pressure-treated wood if you\u2019re growing any vegetables, fruits, or spices."

Repeat this process 3 more times to drill your ends into the sides. Hold each end piece flush against an exterior corner so that the 2 90-degree angles meet. Affix your end boards to the legs by using the same wood screws. Do this on 1 end of each side so that the 2 boards are attached to opposite ends of each side. This will make each side easier to join together. Fit the 2 L-shaped pieces together like puzzle pieces to make a hollow box. Lay 1 end flat on the ground so that its long side sticks up in the air. Take your other side and lay its long edge on top of the opposite leg. While you\u2019re putting the second side down, guide the end that is sticking out in the air on top of the leg on the opposite side. Clamp your 2 L-shaped pieces together with rubber clamps and use 2 1 \u20448 in (4.1 cm) wood screws to affix each section of fence board on your end to the leg it\u2019s laying on top of. You can lay your planter box on its legs now. You will have a stable and hollow box with no bottom. Constructing Your Bottom Measure the interior sides of your box from leg to leg. Measure the 4 interior sides of your box and write the measurements down on a piece of paper so that you can easily refer to them later when you\u2019re cutting. You are going to build a railing for the base of your planter to rest flat, so the railing has to run from each interior edge of your legs to the adjacent interior edges. Your length should be 33 inches (84 cm) and your width 10.5 inches (27 cm) if you\u2019re building a medium-sized planter box. Cut your pieces using your circular saw and fit them in by hand. Using your 2 in \u00d7 2 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm) cedar boards, cut 2 longer pieces and 3 shorter pieces. Push your longer pieces in between the legs on the 2 longer sides, using the tension between the legs to hold them in place against the side. Push 2 smaller pieces in between the interior edges of the legs at both ends, and push 1 smaller piece in between the two sides in the middle, relying on tension to hold them still.Tip: Use a mallet to punch the pieces into place if they\u2019re a little snug and won\u2019t easily move into the bottom of the box. You need the third piece in the middle to support the weight in the center of your box. Lay a level on top of each section of railing to make sure that they\u2019re flat. If they aren\u2019t, tap each section lightly with a mallet until they\u2019re level. Use wood screws to attach the railings to the frame. With your pieces forced into place and level, screw your railings into place with 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) wood screws placed 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) apart across each side of your railing. Hold each screw on the outside of your box, and place them so that they\u2019re level with the center of the railing. Drill a pilot hole using both hands to guide the screw into the correct location. Once the screw punctures the exterior, brace the inside of the railing with your nondominant hand and hold it in place while the screw goes all the way through the wood. A pilot hole refers to any small incision that you make with a drill head or screw to make the threading on the screw catch easily. To drill a pilot hole in your planter, simply take your drill head and pull the trigger for 1-2 seconds at the exact location where you want your screw to go. Brace the railing 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) away from the location that you\u2019re drilling so you don\u2019t drill into your hand. Make sure that you drill through the center of your center railing. If your center railing seems loose, you can use wood glue to provide some additional support. Finishing Your Base Put your 2 base boards on top of the planter and trace the corners out. Your planter needs a floor, but you have to cut around the sections where the legs rest. Lay your 2 remaining pieces of fence board on top, and use a carpentry pencil to trace around each leg post by using a scrap piece to simulate the location of the leg. You can measure the size of each leg and draw the cut out yourself if you\u2019d like, but the scrap piece of 2x2 will be the exact same size as your leg. Do this twice on the same side of each plank so that you have 4 sections drawn out on all 4 corners of your base. Use a jigsaw to cut out the corners for your legs. Lay each plank flat on your work surface. Brace the plank with your nondominant hand and lay the base plate of your jigsaw against the edge where you drew your leg out. Pull the trigger and guide the jigsaw through the first guiding line. Repeat this cut on the adjacent line to remove a square section at the corner for your leg. Do this on all 4 corners of your 2 planks.Warning: Move slowly when operating a jigsaw to make small cuts like this. Accuracy is important if you want your boards to lay flush at the bottom of your box. Drop your base boards into place and drill drainage holes at the bottom. Lay your boards down on the inside of the box one at a time. Drill a 6-8 drainage holes using any sized drill bit across the floor of your planter box. Add 3-4 small rocks around each hole to prevent soil from falling through the hole and to keep the holes from getting clogged. Add your rocks right before you add your soil, since they\u2019ll roll around if you move your planter. You need drainage holes to keep water from building up at the bottom of your planter box.",

    "Use the guide line on the front of the base plate to guide your cutting line.",
    "Repeat this process for each cut until you have 6 pieces of equal length.",
    "Set 2 of the lengths aside.",
    "These will be the bed of your planter box and will come in handy later.",
    "You can use a miter saw instead of a circular saw if you prefer.",
    "You can use the first length as a straight edge to cut your other pieces so that they\u2019re uniform.",
    "Don\u2019t push forward too hard as you cut.",
    "Let the traction from the saw blade pull you through the cut.",
    "Measure 4 pieces of cedar to make your legs.",
    "Use a measuring tape to measure out 4 lengths of equal size on 2 in \u00d7 2 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm) cedar posts.",
    "Use a straight edge or angle square and a carpentry pencil to indicate the location of each cut.",
    "The longer you make your pieces, the higher off of the ground your box will sit.",
    "14 in (36 cm) pieces will make your box sit relatively low to the ground while still keeping it elevated off of the floor.",
    "You can also mark off one cut and then use a single piece as a straight edge for each additional portion.",
    "Rub a file against the edges where you cut to remove any splinters and even out any rough edges.",
    "Cut your cedar boards into 4 pieces of equal length.",
    "Place each section of your 2 in \u00d7 2 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm) board flat on your sawhorse and put the edge of your circular saw\u2019s base plate against the line that you marked.",
    "Pull the trigger on the saw and carefully run it through your guiding line.",
    "Repeat this process for each section until you have 4 separate pieces.",
    "These 4 pieces will serve as the individual legs for your planter box.",
    "You will install them inside your box to keep the frame together.",
    "Measure and cut 4 pieces of fence board for the shorter sides of your box.",
    "You\u2019re going to join your 2 sides together with 4 smaller pieces.",
    "You\u2019re going to stack 2 of these smaller pieces on top of one another for each side, so you need 4 pieces total.",
    "Measure and mark your lengths on the fence board with a measuring tape and straight edge and cut them the same way you cut your other pieces.",
    "These 4 pieces will be used to form the sides on the 2 shorter ends of your box.",
    "12 in (30 cm) is a good length for your fence board pieces if you want a medium-sized planter box.",
    "The ends will determine the horizontal depth of your planter box, so you can use larger pieces to make a bigger box, or smaller pieces to make a shallow planter.",
    "Building Your Frame Clamp 1 leg perpendicular against the end of your first side.",
    "Place 2 pieces of fence post flat on your work surface with the edges hanging over the side.",
    "Line them up by hand so that they lay flat and parallel against one another.",
    "Use rubber clamps to hold the pieces in place.",
    "Take 1 leg, and hold it underneath the edge of the 2 boards.",
    "Move it by hand so that the top and side of the leg are flush against the 90-degree angle at the top of your 2 sides, and clamp it in place.",
    "Drill 4 wood screws through the sides and leg.",
    "With your pieces clamped in place, hold a 1 \u20448 in (4.1 cm) wood screw so that it rests 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top and side of your fence board, directly on top of the leg.",
    "Drill the screw all the way through the side panel and leg to join them.",
    "Repeat this process near each corner of you side panel to secure your leg to the side.",
    "You now have 1 side of your planter box and 1 leg assembled.",
    "Clamp your second leg to the opposite side and drill it in place with wood screws.",
    "Flip your board so that it\u2019s facing the opposite direction.",
    "Lay your leg underneath the 2 opposite sides, with the same side sticking out underneath your fence panels.",
    "Clamp it in place and secure it using your 1 \u20448 in (4.1 cm) wood screws.",
    "You now have 1 entire side built with 2 legs assembled.",
    "Set your finished piece aside and repeat the process to create your second side.",
    "Start by laying out your 2 other fence posts on top of your work surface.",
    "Move them together so that they\u2019re flush and parallel.",
    "Secure them to your 2 leg posts using your drill and 1 \u20448 in (4.1 cm) wood screws Place each screw 1 in (2.5 cm) away from each respective corner of a plank.",
    "You now have your 2 sides and 4 legs assembled.",
    "Join a side and end together by drilling your ends through each side.",
    "Place a finished side flat on your work surface with the legs facing up.",
    "Hold a shorter length of cedar fence board flush against any corner where a leg and edge of a side meet.",
    "Use your nondominant hand to hold the three pieces together while you drill 2 1 \u20448 in (4.1 cm) wood screws through each side of your panel where your leg is.Tip: You are attaching your end pieces to the leg because the fence board is too thin to drill through.",
    "Look at your screw location before sending it all the way through the wood to make sure that you aren\u2019t drilling into the fence board.",
    "Repeat this process 3 more times to drill your ends into the sides.",
    "Hold each end piece flush against an exterior corner so that the 2 90-degree angles meet.",
    "Affix your end boards to the legs by using the same wood screws.",
    "Do this on 1 end of each side so that the 2 boards are attached to opposite ends of each side.",
    "This will make each side easier to join together.",
    "Fit the 2 L-shaped pieces together like puzzle pieces to make a hollow box.",
    "Lay 1 end flat on the ground so that its long side sticks up in the air.",
    "Take your other side and lay its long edge on top of the opposite leg.",
    "While you\u2019re putting the second side down, guide the end that is sticking out in the air on top of the leg on the opposite side.",
    "Clamp your 2 L-shaped pieces together with rubber clamps and use 2 1 \u20448 in (4.1 cm) wood screws to affix each section of fence board on your end to the leg it\u2019s laying on top of.",
    "You can lay your planter box on its legs now.",
    "You will have a stable and hollow box with no bottom.",
    "Constructing Your Bottom Measure the interior sides of your box from leg to leg.",
    "Measure the 4 interior sides of your box and write the measurements down on a piece of paper so that you can easily refer to them later when you\u2019re cutting.",
    "You are going to build a railing for the base of your planter to rest flat, so the railing has to run from each interior edge of your legs to the adjacent interior edges.",
    "Your length should be 33 inches (84 cm) and your width 10.5 inches (27 cm) if you\u2019re building a medium-sized planter box.",
    "Cut your pieces using your circular saw and fit them in by hand.",
    "Using your 2 in \u00d7 2 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm) cedar boards, cut 2 longer pieces and 3 shorter pieces.",
    "Push your longer pieces in between the legs on the 2 longer sides, using the tension between the legs to hold them in place against the side.",
    "Push 2 smaller pieces in between the interior edges of the legs at both ends, and push 1 smaller piece in between the two sides in the middle, relying on tension to hold them still.Tip: Use a mallet to punch the pieces into place if they\u2019re a little snug and won\u2019t easily move into the bottom of the box.",
    "You need the third piece in the middle to support the weight in the center of your box.",
    "Lay a level on top of each section of railing to make sure that they\u2019re flat.",
    "If they aren\u2019t, tap each section lightly with a mallet until they\u2019re level.",
    "Use wood screws to attach the railings to the frame.",
    "With your pieces forced into place and level, screw your railings into place with 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) wood screws placed 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) apart across each side of your railing.",
    "Hold each screw on the outside of your box, and place them so that they\u2019re level with the center of the railing.",
    "Drill a pilot hole using both hands to guide the screw into the correct location.",
    "Once the screw punctures the exterior, brace the inside of the railing with your nondominant hand and hold it in place while the screw goes all the way through the wood.",
    "A pilot hole refers to any small incision that you make with a drill head or screw to make the threading on the screw catch easily.",
    "To drill a pilot hole in your planter, simply take your drill head and pull the trigger for 1-2 seconds at the exact location where you want your screw to go.",
    "Brace the railing 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) away from the location that you\u2019re drilling so you don\u2019t drill into your hand.",
    "Make sure that you drill through the center of your center railing.",
    "If your center railing seems loose, you can use wood glue to provide some additional support.",
    "Finishing Your Base Put your 2 base boards on top of the planter and trace the corners out.",
    "Your planter needs a floor, but you have to cut around the sections where the legs rest.",
    "Lay your 2 remaining pieces of fence board on top, and use a carpentry pencil to trace around each leg post by using a scrap piece to simulate the location of the leg.",
    "You can measure the size of each leg and draw the cut out yourself if you\u2019d like, but the scrap piece of 2x2 will be the exact same size as your leg.",
    "Do this twice on the same side of each plank so that you have 4 sections drawn out on all 4 corners of your base.",
    "Use a jigsaw to cut out the corners for your legs.",
    "Lay each plank flat on your work surface.",
    "Brace the plank with your nondominant hand and lay the base plate of your jigsaw against the edge where you drew your leg out.",
    "Pull the trigger and guide the jigsaw through the first guiding line.",
    "Repeat this cut on the adjacent line to remove a square section at the corner for your leg.",
    "Do this on all 4 corners of your 2 planks.Warning: Move slowly when operating a jigsaw to make small cuts like this.",
    "Accuracy is important if you want your boards to lay flush at the bottom of your box.",
    "Drop your base boards into place and drill drainage holes at the bottom.",
    "Lay your boards down on the inside of the box one at a time.",
    "Drill a 6-8 drainage holes using any sized drill bit across the floor of your planter box.",
    "Add 3-4 small rocks around each hole to prevent soil from falling through the hole and to keep the holes from getting clogged.",
    "Add your rocks right before you add your soil, since they\u2019ll roll around if you move your planter.",
    "You need drainage holes to keep water from building up at the bottom of your planter box."
