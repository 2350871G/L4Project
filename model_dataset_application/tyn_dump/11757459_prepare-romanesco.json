Start the blade of your chef\u2019s knife on top of the romanesco and push it straight down through the stem to split it in half. Then lay each half flat on the cut side and slice vertically through them again so you have 4 wedge-shaped pieces that are easier to work with.You can leave the romanesco in wedges if you want.

Continue cutting the rest of the wedges and throw away the stems.Work slowly and keep your fingers away from the blade so you don\u2019t accidentally cut yourself while you\u2019re working.Variation: You may also break the florets off of the stem by hand if it\u2019s easier for you.

    "Stir the romanesco in the pot for 2\u20133 minutes so the pieces get more tender before removing them from heat.If you try to saute the romanesco without boiling them first, it could still be raw in the middle and have an inconsistent texture.",
    "Dunk the florets in a bowl of cold water for 10 seconds.",
    "Fill a large bowl with cold water and scoop the romanesco into it.",
    "Allow the romanesco to soak for about 10 seconds so the pieces cool down and stop cooking.If you don\u2019t soak the romanesco in cold water, they will have a mushy texture and get overcooked when you try to saute it.",
    "Pat the romanesco dry with a paper towel.",
    "Scoop the florets out of the cold water with a slotted spoon and set them on a piece of paper towel.",
    "Allow them to drip dry before lightly patting them with another piece of paper towel so they aren\u2019t wet when you cook them.You can also let the romanesco air-dry completely.",
    "Saute butter and garlic in a skillet over medium heat.",
    "Put 2 tablespoons (28.4 g) of butter in a skillet and turn it onto medium heat.",
    "Let the butter melt, and tilt the pan so the butter coats it evenly.",
    "Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and let them cook until they\u2019re golden-brownVariation: If you don\u2019t want to use butter, you can also use 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of any other cooking oil.",
    "Add the romanesco and cook it for 5\u20136 minutes.",
    "Stir the romanesco and garlic occasionally to combine the flavors and ensure the pieces don\u2019t overcook.",
    "Keep the romanesco in the pan for 5\u20136 minutes, or until you can easily poke through the pieces with a fork.The ends of the florets will turn golden-brown as you cook them.",
    "Serve the romanesco while it\u2019s still hot.",
    "Scoop the romanesco out of the pan and put it into a serving dish.",
    "Enjoy the romanesco as a healthy side dish with your meal, or combine it with rice or quinoa if you want to incorporate it into your entree.Keep leftover pieces in a resealable bag or container for 7\u201310 days in your fridge.",
    "Steamed Romanesco Bring a pot with 1 in (2.5 cm) of water to a simmer.",
    "Choose a pot that has a lid and is large enough to fit all of the romanesco florets.",
    "Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to the pot and put it on your stove over medium heat.",
    "Keep heating the water until it starts to bubble.",
    "You can also use a wide skillet or pan if you don\u2019t have a pot that\u2019s deep enough for all of your romanesco.",
    "Put the romanesco florets in the pot.",
    "Spread the romanesco as evenly as you can in the pot so each piece is partially submerged.",
    "Be careful not to break the florets any smaller, or else they may not cook evenly.Variation: You can also put the romanesco inside of a steamer basket and place it on top of the pot if you don\u2019t want to put the florets directly in the water.",
    "Cover the pot with a lid.",
    "Immediately put a lid on the pot to trap the steam inside so the florets cook faster.",
    "Make sure the lid fits tightly against the lip of the pot.",
    "Keep the lid on at all times to prevent steam from escaping.",
    "Cook the romanesco for 15 minutes or until they\u2019re tender.",
    "Leave the pot over medium-low heat so it maintains a simmer.",
    "Avoid removing the lid since it lets the steam escape and could affect how long it takes for your romanesco to cook.",
    "After 15 minutes, see if you can easily stab into one of the florets with a fork, which means they\u2019re cooked through and tender.The romanesco will also change to a lighter green color as they cook so you can easily tell when they\u2019re finished cooking.",
    "Drain the romanesco into a colander.",
    "Set a colander in your sink and pour the romanesco into it so the water drains out.",
    "Shake the colander to remove any excess water that\u2019s still stuck between the pieces.If you don\u2019t have a colander, hold the lid against the lip of the pot and slowly pour the water into your sink.",
    "Keep the lid in place so the romanesco doesn\u2019t fall out.",
    "Season the romanesco before serving it.",
    "Return the florets to the pot and sprinkle salt and pepper on them.",
    "Stir the seasoning into the romanesco until it\u2019s thoroughly mixed before serving them.",
    "You can keep cooked romanesco in your fridge for up to 10 days if you store it in a resealable bag or container."
