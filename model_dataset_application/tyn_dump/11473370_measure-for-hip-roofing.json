For trapezoidal roofs, measure the bottom edge, the top edge (also known as the \u201cridge\u201d), and the distance between the 2 edges. If you\u2019re working with a rectangular roof, be sure to measure both the longer and shorter hips separately. You\u2019ll need both sets of dimensions in order to accurately tab out your roof\u2019s total square footage. Jot down eat dimension separately in a notebook or scrap sheet of paper. Don\u2019t forget to label which dimension is which. It\u2019s not necessary to measure the vertical sides of your roof, or to figure out its slope. To find the square footage of a hip roof, you just need to calculate the area of each of its faces. For this, you'll use the same formula that you would use to find the area of an ordinary triangle or trapezoid."

For a trapezoidal roof, add the lengths of the bottom edge and ridge together, divide the sum by 2, and multiply the number you get by the measurement of the line running between the two edges. Do this for every face of differing size. If the bottom edge of one triangular roof face is 30 feet (9.1 m) long and the distance between the peak and the bottom edge is 18 feet (5.5 m), the area of the face is 270 square feet (25 m). If one face of a trapezoidal roof is 30 feet (9.1 m) long at the bottom and 24 feet (7.3 m) long at the top with a 14 ft (4.3 m) height differential, its cumulative area would be 378 square feet (35.1 m).Tip: Punch your measurements into an online roofing calculator to save yourself time and effort.

If you\u2019re trying to work out the total area of the roof of a square building, simply multiply the area of one of the identical faces by 4.
