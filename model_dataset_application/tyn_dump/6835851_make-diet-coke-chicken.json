The amount of time that the chicken will need to simmer depends on whether you chopped or sliced the chicken, and, if whole, how thick the chicken breasts are. When the dish is done cooking, the sauce should be thick and the chicken should be cooked through. If the chicken breasts are whole, you can use a meat thermometer to check if the chicken is cooked periodically. The chicken is done when the thermometer reads 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C)."
