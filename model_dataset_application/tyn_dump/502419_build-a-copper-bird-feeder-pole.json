A good idea is to find a way to secure the feeders in such a way that they could spin easily for a different look and could be removed for cleaning and filling. The easiest way some would think to do this was to drill a hole in the bottom of each arm about an inch from the end. A hole is drilled large enough for a deck nail shaft to fit but not the head. Taking a pair of vice grips, the nails are bent so the pointed end acts as a hook which can be fed through the inside of the hole drilled in the pipe so the nail hook is suspended by its head and can spin freely."
