Let it boil for about 7-10 minutes, depending on how cooked you like your vegetables to be. Rinse the cauliflower in cool water and chop it into florets. Use a knife to cut up the cauliflower head into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces, or roughly bite-size. Try to keep them all a similar size so that they'll fry evenly. The more flat sides your florets have, the easier you\u2019ll find it to fry them. Prepare 2 mixtures for the batter. In one small container, whisk together 2 eggs and \u20444 cup (59 mL) of milk.
