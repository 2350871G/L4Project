Be sure to use a bottle rack inside the pot so that the bottoms of the bottles don\u2019t touch the bottom of the pot directly. When filled, your bottles will be completely submerged in boiling water for a length of time that allows the material on the inside of the bottle caps, or plastisol, to adhere to the glass tops of your bottles, creating a vacuum seal. You can buy a water bath canning pot specifically online or from kitchen supply stores, or just use a pot from home that\u2019s deep enough with a lid and rack. Bottling/canning racks can be purchased online and at some kitchen supply stores. Test yours to make sure that it fits your pot before starting your bottling process."

Check the bottles for air bubbles and lightly tap the sides and bottoms of your bottles if you see any. If you overpour and leave less than 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top of a bottle, carefully pour some back into the pot and try again until you have left the right amount of space at the top."
