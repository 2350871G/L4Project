  "text":" Filling with jam Add jam straight from the jar. Choose a jam that complements the flavor of the cake. Simply spread enough of the jam across the base half of the cake from the edges to the middle, or in a circular fashion. Add gently warmed jam. For jam that is chunkier, warming it will help it spread more easily. This is especially good for a jam like apricot jam. Add the amount needed to a small saucepan. Gently heat for a few minutes, stirring to help break down the jam a little. Then remove from the heat and spread across the base half of the cake until covered. Place the top layer on the cake. Frost or ice the cake if you're doing so. Filling with syrup Select a suitable syrup. When using syrup, the expectation is that it will cover the base half but it will also seep into the cake, so it must be a flavor that matches well with the cake and the cake texture must be such that it will take well to being soaked, such as a sponge cake or a cake with a slightly dry texture that could do with having moisture added.

Frost or ice the rest of the cake if you're doing so. Buttercream filling Use the ingredients outlined above.  Beat the butter in a mixing bowl until smooth.  Gradually beat in the icing, sugar, and cocoa powder.  Add the brandy and mix well.  Spread or pipe over the cake base until filled.  Place the top layer on. Frost or ice the rest of the cake if you're doing so.",
