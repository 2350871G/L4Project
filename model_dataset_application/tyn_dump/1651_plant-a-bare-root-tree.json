If your area is experiencing a heavy long term drought, do take the time to water your young trees in the winter about every 2 weeks. Trees get very stressed under those type of weather conditions and need the additional moisture to help them survive and thrive."

Hammer a metre-long (39\") stake into the ground  before planting the tree, at a 45 degree angle and for three quarters of its length, in a position so that the top of the stake is above where the tree is being planted. Then tie the tree stem to the stake with a rubber tree tie."
