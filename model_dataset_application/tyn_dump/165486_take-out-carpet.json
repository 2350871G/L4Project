Pull up a corner of the carpet and see what's underneath if you haven't yet. Will you put down new carpet, or hire someone to do so? If so, you may wish to leave the tack strips in place if they are in good condition. Ask the installers you will hire what they prefer. Will you lay tile, vinyl, wood, or another hard floor?"

If you want the installers of the new floor to haul away the old carpet, make sure they know in advance and figure it into your price. Also, make sure that they know not to charge you for the time to tear out the carpet or move furniture. Call the dump where you usually take or send your trash and find out what they charge for disposal. Some may charge a different rate for carpet, so be sure to mention that it is carpet. Make sure you have some way to haul away the carpet you will discard. Hauling services are often available, as are rental trucks. Check out your phone book and see what you find."
