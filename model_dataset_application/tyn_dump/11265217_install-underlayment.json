Most wood floors can be lifted with a pry bar, and you can also use a utility knife to cut up carpeting. Slide a metal scraper underneath the flooring to break through any mortar, staples, or other adhesives. Clear out as much debris as possible.

Cut through the caulk using a utility knife, then pull the boards off the wall with a flat knife and pry bar. The door frames can also get in the way if they are long enough to touch the subfloor. Remove them the same way as the baseboards. Reinstall these components after you finish laying the new underlayment. If the boards are in poor condition, replace them to freshen up your room's aesthetic. You need about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) of clearance between the bottom of the frame and the subfloor. If that space is already available, you won't need to remove the frame. Otherwise, cut the frame shorter to create space for the underlayment."

You can use a 120-grit piece of sandpaper or flooring edger to wear away high spots in wood floors. If your subfloor is made of concrete, add fresh concrete to the lower areas to fill them in. Another option is to get a thicker subfloor material or self-leveling compound to cover the low areas. Try to level out the floor as much as you can first. Leveling the subfloor is important for keeping the underlayment flat and damage-resistant."

          "description":"Plywood is a common underlayment because it creates a smooth surface for most types of flooring. The boards have to be at the correct thickness in order to fit between the walls and subfloor. After purchasing the boards, leave them in your home for up to 2 days to warm to room temperature. Then, inspect them and discard any that boards that look damaged. Plywood underlayment is available online or at most home improvement stores. Look there for any other tools you may need to install the underlayment. Switch to cement boards if you're planning on installing tile. Spread mortar on the floor first to place the boards. You could also use particle board, which is cheaper but less resistant to damage. Pair a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) layer of particle board with a \u20448 in (1.6 cm) layer of plywood to strengthen it."

Tape some heavy pieces of construction paper together, leaving a 1 in (2.5 cm) border on all sides to expose the floor. Trace outlines, then use scissors to cut out the shapes. Transfer the design to the plywood. Since moving whole plywood boards can be difficult, paper templates make the job easier. It helps the most with small rooms where you need to cut the boards to a specific shape. Use the template cuts to compensate for vents, pipes, trim, curves, and other features in the room."

Take advantage of a circular saw to make broader cuts and trim the boards to size. Always wear a dust mask, safety glasses, and hearing protection when operating a saw. Don't wear gloves or a long-sleeved shirt that could get caught by the blade. Before installing the plywood, move the boards into the room to see how they fit. They should fit together cleanly like puzzle pieces. Keep cutting and adjusting them as needed until they are perfect."

Keep the factory-cut edges against the wall and over breaks in the subfloor, if possible. Position the boards so they are perpendicular to the seams or joists in the existing floor. Make sure the seams in the plywood don't overlap the seams in the subfloor. It can weaken the underlayment. If you arrange the boards so they are perpendicular to the seams, this won't be a problem. Fill in tight areas, such as spots near walls and furniture, with cut boards. Face any cuts you make toward the inside part of the room. The factory-made cuts are easier to align with the walls."

Measure in \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the edges of the boards, then place a staple every 2 in (5.1 cm) along the underlayment. Secure the sides closest to the walls. Leave the other sides alone and staple them in the next step. You could also use a nail gun to nail the underlayment to the floor.

Make sure you space the staples out evenly. When you're done, the board should feel stuck to the floor so you can move on and finish securing the rest of the boards. Some brands of underlayment come with markings showing you where to attach the staples. You can follow the markings diagonally across the boards, placing staples as you move."

Felt tends to be a little denser than foam and made with recycled material. Rubber resists moisture and sound better than the other types of material, but it's also more expensive. If you're installing underlayment for a roof, stick to asphalt-saturated felt or rubberized asphalt, or a plastic synthetic."

Chalk shows up well on most surfaces and is difficult to wear off, but you can also use a marker. Keep the lines straight so you know exactly where the seams belong in case you need to move the underlayment. Keep in mind that the underlayment may slide around a little while you're working. If you have good outlines, you can always reposition the material for a successful install."

Also, mark where you need to cut the underlayment to fit against the walls. The double outline will allow you to cut a second patch out of the underlayment. Glue that patch back in place after you finish installing the underlayment roll. Keep in mind that the underlayment material won't perfectly align with obstacles. You may need to cut along the sides of 2 rolls to fit them around a pillar, for instance."

Choose a modified thinset mixed with a latex additive, then stir it into a plastic mixing bucket with water. Keep stirring it with a paddle mixer until it looks spreadable like a thick peanut butter. After letting it rest for 10 minutes, mix it a second time. Thinset mortar is available online or at most home improvement stores. Remember to put on a dust mask and safety glasses before mixing the mortar. Check the manufacturer's instructions for the recommended ratio of water to thinset. It can vary between brands, but you usually need about 6 cups (1,400 mL) of water for every 50 lb (23 kg) of mortar. If you're installing underlayment over concrete, consider trying an unmodified thinset mortar instead. You don't need the additive to get it to bond strongly to the existing subfloor."

Push down on it with a clean grout float or another flat tool. Sweep the tool from the center of the underlayment to its ends to press out any wrinkles. To check the membrane's adhesion, you can pull it back and look at the mortar underneath it. Half of the mortar will stay on the floor, but half of it will stick to the underlayment."

    "Another option is to get a thicker subfloor material or self-leveling compound to cover the low areas.",
    "Try to level out the floor as much as you can first.",
    "Leveling the subfloor is important for keeping the underlayment flat and damage-resistant.",
    "Placing New Wood Underlayment Purchase \u20444 in (1.9 cm) plywood or another wood underlayment.",
    "Plywood is a common underlayment because it creates a smooth surface for most types of flooring.",
    "The boards have to be at the correct thickness in order to fit between the walls and subfloor.",
    "After purchasing the boards, leave them in your home for up to 2 days to warm to room temperature.",
    "Then, inspect them and discard any that boards that look damaged.",
    "Plywood underlayment is available online or at most home improvement stores.",
    "Look there for any other tools you may need to install the underlayment.",
    "Switch to cement boards if you're planning on installing tile.",
    "Spread mortar on the floor first to place the boards.",
    "You could also use particle board, which is cheaper but less resistant to damage.",
    "Pair a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) layer of particle board with a \u20448 in (1.6 cm) layer of plywood to strengthen it.",
    "Measure the room size and any spots you need to cut into the plywood.",
    "Professional installers often lay a big sheet of paper on the floor to make a template.",
    "Tape some heavy pieces of construction paper together, leaving a 1 in (2.5 cm) border on all sides to expose the floor.",
    "Trace outlines, then use scissors to cut out the shapes.",
    "Transfer the design to the plywood.",
    "Since moving whole plywood boards can be difficult, paper templates make the job easier.",
    "It helps the most with small rooms where you need to cut the boards to a specific shape.",
    "Use the template cuts to compensate for vents, pipes, trim, curves, and other features in the room.",
    "Cut the plywood to fit squarely inside the room.",
    "After transferring the template design, begin preparing the boards.",
    "To complete smaller cuts such as vent holes, consider using a jigsaw.",
    "Take advantage of a circular saw to make broader cuts and trim the boards to size.",
    "Always wear a dust mask, safety glasses, and hearing protection when operating a saw.",
    "Don't wear gloves or a long-sleeved shirt that could get caught by the blade.",
    "Before installing the plywood, move the boards into the room to see how they fit.",
    "They should fit together cleanly like puzzle pieces.",
    "Keep cutting and adjusting them as needed until they are perfect.",
    "Lay the plywood in the room across the existing floor.",
    "Start by moving the biggest pieces of plywood in first.",
    "These pieces usually belong near door openings with lots of foot traffic.",
    "Keep the factory-cut edges against the wall and over breaks in the subfloor, if possible.",
    "Position the boards so they are perpendicular to the seams or joists in the existing floor.",
    "Make sure the seams in the plywood don't overlap the seams in the subfloor.",
    "It can weaken the underlayment.",
    "If you arrange the boards so they are perpendicular to the seams, this won't be a problem.",
    "Fill in tight areas, such as spots near walls and furniture, with cut boards.",
    "Face any cuts you make toward the inside part of the room.",
    "The factory-made cuts are easier to align with the walls.",
    "Leave the boards up to \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the wall.",
    "The boards should always be at least \u20448 in (0.32 cm) from the wall.",
    "They will expand and contract as the weather changes.",
    "The extra space prevents them from cracking.",
    "Leaving a little space allowance also protects the walls.",
    "Plywood can scratch up walls if you're not careful.",
    "It's better to avoid having to deal with repairs and a new coat of paint.",
    "Staple every 2 in (5.1 cm) along the outer edges of the boards.",
    "Work on one board at a time, starting with the biggest ones up against the wall.",
    "Load a pneumatic stapler with galvanized \u20448 in (2.2 cm) underlayment staples.",
    "Measure in \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the edges of the boards, then place a staple every 2 in (5.1 cm) along the underlayment.",
    "Secure the sides closest to the walls.",
    "Leave the other sides alone and staple them in the next step.",
    "You could also use a nail gun to nail the underlayment to the floor.",
    "However, make sure the galvanized nails you use are short enough to avoid puncturing all the way through the subfloor.",
    "Finish stapling the boards with staples spaced 4 in (10 cm).",
    "Measure in from the initial rows of staples you made to fasten the boards to the floor.",
    "Then, add rows of staples all the way across each board.",
    "Make sure you space the staples out evenly.",
    "When you're done, the board should feel stuck to the floor so you can move on and finish securing the rest of the boards.",
    "Some brands of underlayment come with markings showing you where to attach the staples.",
    "You can follow the markings diagonally across the boards, placing staples as you move.",
    "Fitting Fabric and Rubber Underlayment Rolls Choose a type of underlayment up to \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick.",
    "Look for underlayment rated as 2 to 3 mm thick for most projects.",
    "Foam is the least expensive option and provides cushioning for all types of flooring.",
    "Felt tends to be a little denser than foam and made with recycled material.",
    "Rubber resists moisture and sound better than the other types of material, but it's also more expensive.",
    "If you're installing underlayment for a roof, stick to asphalt-saturated felt or rubberized asphalt, or a plastic synthetic.",
    "Roll the membrane out inside the room.",
    "Start in the far corner of the room.",
    "Spread the first roll of the membrane material out next to the wall.",
    "Continue adding more rolls of the material until the entire floor is covered.",
    "Leave a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) gap between the underlayment and the walls.",
    "Consider marking the rolls in permanent marker so you know where each one fits in the room.",
    "For instance, mark the first roll near the far wall as 1, then the one next to it as 2.",
    "Mark the positioning of the underlayment using chalk or another tool.",
    "Go around the entire room, outlining the borders of each piece of underlayment.",
    "Chalk shows up well on most surfaces and is difficult to wear off, but you can also use a marker.",
    "Keep the lines straight so you know exactly where the seams belong in case you need to move the underlayment.",
    "Keep in mind that the underlayment may slide around a little while you're working.",
    "If you have good outlines, you can always reposition the material for a successful install.",
    "Outline vents, pipes, and other obstacles on the underlayment.",
    "Use a tape measure to determine the length and width of pipes and other obstacles.",
    "Sketch the measurements on top of the underlayment using a marker or chalk.",
    "For obstacles in the middle of the room, extend one edge of the outline so it's about \u20448 in (1.6 cm) longer than the obstacle you're working around.",
    "Also, mark where you need to cut the underlayment to fit against the walls.",
    "The double outline will allow you to cut a second patch out of the underlayment.",
    "Glue that patch back in place after you finish installing the underlayment roll.",
    "Keep in mind that the underlayment material won't perfectly align with obstacles.",
    "You may need to cut along the sides of 2 rolls to fit them around a pillar, for instance.",
    "Cut the underlayment using a utility knife.",
    "First, cut any underlayment strips you need to make in order to fill in exposed floor areas.",
    "Tackle the exterior borders next, remembering to leave a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) margin between the wall and the underlayment material.",
    "Finish by slicing along the outlines you made for pillars and other room obstacles.",
    "Work slowly to avoid damaging the underlayment.",
    "Although it is easier to cut from the backside, but you don't need to flip it over at all if you're careful.",
    "Mix thinset mortar in a bucket until it reaches a spreadable consistency.",
    "Thinset mortar is a cement adhesive often used to bind underlayment to cement.",
    "Choose a modified thinset mixed with a latex additive, then stir it into a plastic mixing bucket with water.",
    "Keep stirring it with a paddle mixer until it looks spreadable like a thick peanut butter.",
    "After letting it rest for 10 minutes, mix it a second time.",
    "Thinset mortar is available online or at most home improvement stores.",
    "Remember to put on a dust mask and safety glasses before mixing the mortar.",
    "Check the manufacturer's instructions for the recommended ratio of water to thinset.",
    "It can vary between brands, but you usually need about 6 cups (1,400 mL) of water for every 50 lb (23 kg) of mortar.",
    "If you're installing underlayment over concrete, consider trying an unmodified thinset mortar instead.",
    "You don't need the additive to get it to bond strongly to the existing subfloor.",
    "Spread the mortar across the floor with a trowel.",
    "Starting on the far end of the room, roll up the underlayment.",
    "Add the mortar directly to the subfloor.",
    "Move in one direction only, spreading the mortar into a consistent layer no more than \u204416 in (0.48 cm) thick.",
    "Fill in the entire exposed floor with mortar.",
    "You're better off working on one section of the underlayment at a time.",
    "If you try to cover the entire floor, the mortar will get messy and dry out before you get a chance to put the underlayment back in place.",
    "Roll the underlayment roll onto the mortar and press it flat.",
    "Unroll the underlayment again, making sure it lines up properly with the piece next to it.",
    "Once you're sure you have it where you want it, walk over to its center.",
    "Push down on it with a clean grout float or another flat tool.",
    "Sweep the tool from the center of the underlayment to its ends to press out any wrinkles.",
    "To check the membrane's adhesion, you can pull it back and look at the mortar underneath it.",
    "Half of the mortar will stay on the floor, but half of it will stick to the underlayment.",
    "Continue spreading mortar until the installation is finished.",
    "Roll up the underlayment sheets one by one, spreading mortar under each of them.",
    "Press them flat after installing them again.",
    "You won't need to wait for the mortar to dry before walking on the underlayment.",
    "When you're done, mix more mortar as needed to fill in any gaps you notice in the underlayment.",
    "Remember to return the additional pieces of underlayment you cut out in order to work around obstacles.",
    "If you don't add mortar over the underlayment, you could start installing flooring right away.",
    "However, consider waiting a day for the mortar to set."
