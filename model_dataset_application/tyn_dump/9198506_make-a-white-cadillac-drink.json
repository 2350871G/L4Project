Serving the White Cadillac Chill a cocktail glass. This cocktail is best served in a chilled cocktail glass. To chill a cocktail glass, pour cold water and ice into the glass. Let the ice and water sit in the glass for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, pour out the water and ice, dry the glass with a towel, and your glass is chilled and ready for a cocktail. Strain the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass. Once you\u2019ve shaken the mixture well, use a strainer to pour the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass. Many cocktail shakers come with a strainer, but you can use a separate strainer if your shaker does not have one. Add chocolate shavings to the drink. The drink is ready now, but you can add some extra flavor and decoration by adding chocolate shavings. Choose the chocolate of your choice. White chocolate is the closest to the flavor of the cocktail, but a milk or dark chocolate will add an extra punch of color and flavor. Sprinkle a handful of the shavings over the drink. Serve while still cold. Serve or enjoy the drink as soon as you are finished making it. Add extra ice if you find that is not as cold as you\u2019d like it to be. Repeat the process for more than one drink. The first mixture creates enough beverage for one cocktail. If you need to make more than one cocktail, repeat the process. Repeat until you\u2019ve made the desired amount of cocktails. Trying Variations of the Recipe Use a three ingredient recipe.
