However, keep in mind that this does not work for all knit fabrics, and some people simply dislike the look of an unhemmed garment. For example, if you are making a jersey knit dress or skirt, then you can often get away with skipping the hem. To see if your fabric will hold up against a hem-free finish, try gently stretching the raw edge of the fabric to see if it frays or unravels when you do so. If it does, then skipping the hem may not be a great idea for your fabric. If it holds up, then you can probably skip the hem."

Your serger should have a rolled hem setting that you can switch on and then sew along the raw edge of your knit fabric to create the rolled hem. If you do not have a serger, then you can also try sewing a rolled hem by hand. However, keep in mind that this can take a long time if the hem is long."

You can do a lettuce hem the same way you do a rolled hem, but you will need to stretch the fabric slightly as you sew. Gently stretch the edges of the fabric as you sew. Do not stretch to the point of extreme tension, just stretch the fabric slightly to create the ruffling effect. You will need a serger to do a lettuce hem as well."

For example, if you want a \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) hem, then you could get \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) interfacing tape. Then, cut he interfacing to the length needed for your hem and lay it down on the wrong side of the fabric so that it is about \u00bc\u201d (0.6 cm) from the raw edge.
