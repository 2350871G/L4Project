  "text":" Sanding the Furniture Take off any handles or knobs from the furniture. Put them in a plastic bag so you don\u2019t lose them. If something won\u2019t detach from the furniture, cover it with painter\u2019s tape. Fill in dents in the furniture with a wood filler. You can find wood filler at your local hardware store. Let the filler dry per the instructions on the label. Use a 120-grit sandpaper to lightly sand the furniture\u2019s surface. Sand in circular motions until the surface of the furniture looks dull and less glossy. Don\u2019t sand too much or you might tear up the laminate from the surface. Wipe down the furniture with a damp cloth to remove any wood dust. Make sure the surface of the furniture is clean before you begin the priming process. Applying a Primer Lay down a tarp in a well-ventilated area. Move the furniture onto the tarp so no primer or paint gets on the floor. Use newspaper if you don't have a tarp. Apply an oil-based bonding primer to the furniture\u2019s surface. Look for an oil-based bonding primer at your local hardware or paint store. Apply the primer using a brush or roller until there\u2019s an even coverage on the entire surface of the furniture. Use a spray can primer for an easier application. Let the primer dry for at least four hours. After four hours, gently touch the primed surface with the tip of your finger to see if it\u2019s fully dried. If the primer is still wet, let it finish drying. Sand the primed surface with a 220-grit sandpaper. Lightly sand in circular motions like you did the first time you sanded the furniture. Wipe off any dust from the surface with a damp cloth. Painting the Furniture Use an acrylic latex paint. Decide whether you want your finish to be glossy or matte, and look for an acrylic latex paint with that finish. You can find acrylic latex paint at your local hardware or paint store. Apply the first coat of paint using a brush or roller. Paint using short, even strokes going in the same direction. It\u2019s OK if the first coat looks slightly patchy or uneven. Let the paint dry for at least two hours. Some paints may take longer to dry, so check the label on the paint you\u2019re using for specific drying instructions. After two hours check to see if the first coat of paint is dry using your fingertips. Alternate between painting and drying until you get an even coverage. This could take between three to four coats of paint. Allow the furniture to dry for at least two hours between each coat. Let the newly-painted furniture cure for a week. You can re-attach any handles or knobs to the furniture once the final coat is dry, but avoid setting anything on the furniture until it's cured for a week to prevent peeling. You can also add a paint sealer to the surface of the furniture after the last coat dries.",
