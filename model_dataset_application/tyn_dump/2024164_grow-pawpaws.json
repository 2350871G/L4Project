    "Using a paintbrush or something soft, rub a flower of one pawpaw tree to collect pollen.",
    "Then proceed to rub a flower of another tree.",
    "You cannot take pollen from one tree and use it on the same tree.",
    "Each individual flower will only accept pollen from a flower from a genetically distinct individual tree.",
    "If you're growing pawpaws outdoors, insects will pollinate your trees for you as long as you have 2 unrelated trees growing nearby.",
    "Monitor your pawpaw fruits and determine when they're ready for harvesting.",
    "Fruit production typically begins after trees reach 6 feet (1.8 m), which usually occurs after 5 to 7 years.",
    "Harvesting Your Pawpaw Fruits Squeeze potential fruits to test their ripeness.",
    "Using your thumb and forefinger, gently squeeze the fruits you believe are ripe.",
    "If it's still hard and doesn't give in to pressure, it needs more time.",
    "When the fruits turn a brownish yellow, they are usually ready to be picked.",
    "Picking pawpaws to early will cause unripe fruits to turn dark, but never soft.",
    "This prevents them from ever sweetening.",
    "Shake the pawpaw tree gently.",
    "The simplest way to test for ripe pawpaws is a gentle shake of the tree.",
    "Ripe fruits will fall to the ground, while fruits that need more time will stay attached to the tree.",
    "Pawpaws bruise readily, so skip this step if you're growing your fruits for market.",
    "Smell your pawpaws prior to eating them.",
    "Always smell your pawpaw fruits before you eat them.",
    "If they are ready, they will give off a strong smell akin to floral perfume.",
    "Any fruits that fail this test can be placed on your counter for ripening.",
    "Once the pawpaw aroma begins to fill the room, they're ready to eat.",
    "Refrigerate or freeze pawpaws that you want to preserve.",
    "Pawpaws can be placed in the refrigerator for several weeks.",
    "If you're going to be freezing them, they will last for a year or more."
