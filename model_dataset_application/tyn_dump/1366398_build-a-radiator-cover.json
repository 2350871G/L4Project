The idea is to make the cover large enough to easily slide over the radiator. For example, a radiator that is 10 inches (25cm) deep, 20 inches (50cm) tall, and 30 inches (76cm) wide, you might need 12 inches (30cm) clearance in depth, 22 inches (55cm) clearance in height, and 32 inches (81cm) clearance in width. This will give you a snug but still comfortable cover for your radiator."

Fiberboard, or MDF (medium density fiberboard) is a combination of sawdust and resins packed tightly together. It is inexpensive, takes paint well, and won't require miters that plywoods require. On the downside, it doesn't take wood stains especially well. Veneered plywood. Veneered plywood is incredibly sturdy and beautiful unfinished, but also takes a wood stain really nicely. On the flip side, it is considerably more expensive than MDF, and probably requires some mitering on the edges of the plywood so that you don't see the center of the plywood core."

You'll use it on the wall behind the cover to radiate heat back into the room and supercharge the efficiency of the radiator. Cutting the Wood and the Moldings Consider cutting the panels of your cover at the hardware supply store. If you don't have a skill or circular saw, a jig, or a workspace that will make cutting your wood and sheet metal easy, an easy way of getting your materials cut is to have them processed wherever you buy them. Most hardware supply stores will cut your materials for free if you supply them with the dimensions. Start cutting the two side panels.

Using the same technique, plan on cutting the top \u00bd inch (1cm) wider than the sides and 1 (2.5cm) inch longer than the width of the front. This will give the top an elegant differentiation. Decide how large you want your grate opening to be on the front panel. Depending on how large your radiator is, draw straight lines that are between 3 to 5 inches (7.5 to 12.5 cm) away from the sides and top, and slightly more (4 to 6 inches) from the bottom. This will make the screen grating the centerpiece of the front panel. If you wish to have grated openings on the side panels as well as the front panel, follow the exact same procedure. Cut the rectangle from the middle of the front panel using a plunge cut.

Finish off the corners using a simple handsaw. Use a handsaw to extend each cut until it hits the corner. This will remove the center piece from the front panel. Measure the rectangle in the front panel and cut your cove molding to fit in all four sides. Cut two 45\u00b0 inside miters in each piece of molding, so that the four pieces will form a mitered rectangle (reminiscent of a picture frame) when fitted into the front panel. Assembling the Cover Glue the moldings in place inside the front panel with yellow wood glue. Secure the moldings in place with some headless pin nails. Measure, cut, and fit the grate. Place the metal grating on the inside of the front panel. Leaving at least 1 and \u00bd inch clearance on each side of the center rectangle, cut the grading using a straight edge and a level as a guide.
