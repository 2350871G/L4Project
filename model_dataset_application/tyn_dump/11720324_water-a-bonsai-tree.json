Otherwise, it's too dry and is in need of water. If the soil on the sides of the planter feels dry but the soil near the trunk is damp, don\u2019t water it and check it again in about 8 to 12 hours."

When it's time to water, this top layer will appear extra loose and dull-gray in color.

Pull it out to check the water line before every day or touch it to your inner wrist or cheek to feel for moisture. Reinsert the chopstick into the soil at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the trunk of the tree so it\u2019s ready to check the next day. Use a clean wooden or bamboo chopstick\u2014this won\u2019t work with ceramic or plastic chopsticks. Don't stick the chopstick into the soil any deeper than 1 in (2.5 cm) because doing so might disturb the root system. Some store-bought bonsai trees come with small wooden posts for this very reason."

The idea is to fully saturate the soil but not so much that it stays sopping wet, so stop watering as soon as you see water dripping out of the bottom. If you notice yellowing leaves or shriveling branches, skip the second watering because these are signs of oxygen deprivation due to too much water. If your bonsai tree has crispy leaves, do a third 30-second watering or revive it in a water bath."
