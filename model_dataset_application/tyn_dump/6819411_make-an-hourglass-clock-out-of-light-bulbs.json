Place a cardboard box under the light bulb, so that it catches any falling glass. Goggles are needed in this step because it involves breaking glass. This is the part that is done by adults only. Use needle-nose pliers to remove the metal tip from the bottom of the light bulb. Carefully push up the sides of metal tip away from the black glass part. Hold on really tightly on one side of the bulb. Yank out the metal piece. You will feel some little wires snap when this is done. Break away the black glass carefully and remove it. This is done by firmly holding one side of the glass with pliers and twisting it up to break the glass. Hold on the bulb firmly\u2013\u2013the black glass is quite thick and it takes some force to break. Be very careful while doing this step. Look at the bulb. You will be able to see the inside parts of the light bulb at this step. Use a flathead screwdriver to carefully snap the interior tube, using the screwdriver as a lever from the bottom. It will make a little sound as the gas escapes. Smash the remaining glass containing the tube. It takes a little force to do this, so hold on the light bulb firmly. The light bulb will not break, provided that you keep the screwdriver away from the bulb itself. Pull out any remaining wires and glass tube with the pliers.  Pour salt into the light bulb and shake it. This will remove all the white substance from the inside edge of the light bulb. Use a screwdriver to break off any remaining bits of glass around the interior edge. Now you have a hollow light bulb. That was the hardest part of this project. Making the hourglass Obtain sand. Make sure that you have enough sand to place in the cookie sheet. The sand can be bought either at a garden store or obtained free from a beach. If you are using beach sand, rinse it thoroughly to remove any non-sand materials. Dry the sand and spread it out on a cookie sheet. Put it into the oven at 350\u00baF/180\u00baC.

Make sure that you place a hole in the center of both for the sand to flow through. The picture is similar, but it gives you an idea of what you have to do. Making the frame Build the frame. This is the fun part because you can make it any way you want it to look. A simple hand saw can take care of the whole job. You will need measuring tape and a hammer for the nails. Also, you need four columns, a base, and a top for the frame. Look at your work so far. You are almost done; you can see that there are three columns in place. Do a mock-up. This is the part in which you set up your materials in the way that you want it to ultimately look.
