Don\u2019t draw the line too thick, or else the marker will be visible after you make your cut. If you don\u2019t want to draw directly on the glass, put a piece of paper with the shape you want to draw underneath the glass so you can trace it with the glass cutter."

Hold the glass cutter so your index and middle fingers are on top of it, and so the wheel points down. Press the wheel onto the glass where you plan on making your cut.

Pull the glass cutter toward you along the outline you drew to leave a score mark on the glass. Keep dragging the glass cutter until you reach the edge of the glass to complete your cut. The glass cutter will only cut part way through the glass to make it easier to break. Don\u2019t try to force the cutter completely through the glass, or else it may shatter or break in a different place. Only make 1 cut at a time so it\u2019s easier to break apart later on.Tip: If you want the score to be perfectly straight, guide the glass cutter with a straightedge so the line isn\u2019t crooked."

Open the pliers and gently squeeze the handles together to grip the edge of the glass. Make sure the pliers don\u2019t cover any part of your cut or else it won\u2019t make a clean edge when you break it.

If the piece of glass doesn\u2019t break along the score line, then flip it over and try using the glass cutter again to make the cut slightly deeper."

    "If the edges of the bottle are very uneven, it may be difficult to sand the bottle to the shape you want.",
    "Try cutting another bottle instead since it\u2019s easier.Tip: Wet the piece of sandpaper if it\u2019s difficult to smooth out the rough edges.",
    "Cutting Bottles with Yarn Cut a length of yarn that can wrap around the bottle 3-4 times.",
    "Use a fabric or acrylic piece of yarn since they are the most absorbent and work the best.",
    "Wrap the end of the yarn around the bottle along the line you want to cut 3-4 times to find the length you need.",
    "Unwind the yarn and use a pair of scissors to cut it.",
    "You can also use twine if you don\u2019t have any yarn.",
    "Don\u2019t use thread or string since it\u2019s too thin to cut through the glass.",
    "Soak the yarn in acetone nail polish remover.",
    "Fill a small bowl with acetone nail polish remover and dip the piece of yarn into it.",
    "Make sure the yarn is completely saturated with the acetone, or else you won\u2019t be able to cut the bottle well.",
    "Pull the yarn out from the acetone and shake any excess off of the surface.",
    "You can buy acetone nail polish remover from convenience stores.",
    "Wrap the yarn around the bottle where you want to cut it.",
    "Take the acetone-soaked yarn and rewrap it around the bottle it the place you measured it.",
    "Once you loop it around the bottle the third or fourth time, tuck the end of the yarn underneath the loops to hold it in place.",
    "Push the loops as close together as you can to make the cut more precise.Tip: If the yarn still doesn\u2019t stay in place, cut a new piece of yarn that\u2019s 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) longer so you can tie a knot.",
    "Light the yarn on fire with a lighter.",
    "Hold the bottle over your sink so you don\u2019t risk burning anything else.",
    "Hold the lighter underneath your bottle and light the yarn so it catches on fire.",
    "Rotate the bottle so the flame spreads evenly around the yarn wrapped onto the bottle.",
    "The fire will burn the acetone and heat the yarn and bottle so it\u2019s easier to break.",
    "Be very careful while working with an open flame so you don\u2019t burn yourself.",
    "Submerge the bottle in ice water immediately after the yarn goes out.",
    "After about 30 seconds or when the flame on the yarn goes out, dip the bottle completely in a bowl full of ice water.",
    "The sudden change in temperature will cause the bottle to break where you wrapped it with yarn.",
    "Once the bottle breaks apart, pull it out of the water and let it dry.",
    "Be careful with the bottle after it breaks since the edges might be sharp.",
    "If the bottle doesn\u2019t break after the first time, soak another piece of yarn in acetone and repeat the process.",
    "Sand the broken edges with 220-grit sandpaper to remove any rough edges.",
    "Apply a gentle amount of pressure to the sandpaper around the edges of the bottle to smooth it out.",
    "Rotate the bottle while you sand it so you can get an even finish completely around the break.",
    "Keep working around the edge until there aren\u2019t any shards left on the bottle.",
    "If the edges are very uneven, you may not be able to sand them smooth."
