In most cases, halving the gourd down or across the center will be sufficient. Then:\nUse a spoon or your hand to tear out the seeds of the squash. These will likely be slimy with gourd guts. Place the seeds in your colander. Once you have removed as many seeds from the squash as you desire, run cool water over the seeds in the colander to clean them.
