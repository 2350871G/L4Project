You\u2019ll need the paper towels in the hole to support the expanding foam you\u2019re about to add. Without the paper towels, the foam would fall to the bottom of the hollow door.

Squirt a generous amount into the hole, so that the foam expands to fill the hollow space behind the hole. Allow the foam to dry. This will take several hours, so it\u2019s best to let it dry overnight. You can purchase foam insulation at any local hardware store or home-supply store. If the store has a variety of options, purchase a low-expansion type. This will leave you with less cleanup."

This material will dry and harden quickly, so you\u2019ll need to work fast. After about 5 minutes, once the filler has started to thicken, take the edge of a putty knife and scrape it across the filler. This will smooth the surface and remove any excess, semi-dry filler.
