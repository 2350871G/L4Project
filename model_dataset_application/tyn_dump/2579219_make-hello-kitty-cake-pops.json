  "text":" Making the Cake Pops Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C), and lightly grease your baking pans. You can use one 13 by 9 by 2-inch (33 by 23 by 5-centimeter) sheet pan or two 8 or 9-inch (20 or 23-centimeter) round pans. Beat together your cake mix, pudding, eggs, water, and oil. This will take about 2 minutes in an electric mixer. You can also use a handheld beater or a food processor fitted with whisks. You are adding more ingredients to your cake mix than what is stated on the package. This will help make your cake richer and taste homemade. You can also use white cake mix and vanilla pudding. You can also use chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding instead. Pour the batter into your grease baking pan(s). Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture into the pan(s). If you have any residue inside the bowl, use the rubber spatula to scrape it out and into the pan. Bake the cake in the center rack of the oven. The cakes are ready when they turn golden brown, and a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean. Your baking times will vary depending on the shape of your baking pan:\nIf you used a round baking pan, your cake will be ready in 30 to 35 minutes.

Then, take the cake out of the pan, and let it finish cooling completely. Don't worry if the cake breaks or comes apart when you take it out of the pan; you will be crumbling it up anyway. Making and Shaping the Cake Pops Crumble the cake in a large bowl. Use your hands to do this. Keep crumbling the cake until there are no large chunks left. Be careful not to squish the cake into dough, however. Gently mix in 1 to 1\u00bd cups (225 to 340 grams) of the frosting into the crumbled cake. Use a rubber spatula or the back of a metal spoon to do this. Don't use all of the frosting. If you use too much, your cake balls will be too mushy and won't hold their form. Roll the mixture into 1\u00bd-inch (4-centimeter) balls. You will need about 2 tablespoons of the cake pop mixture for each ball. Don't worry about making the ears just yet. Flatten the balls into slight ovals. Hello Kitty's head is not a perfect circle, but rather an oval. Flattening the cake balls slightly will give you a more authentic Hello Kitty shape.

Don't cram the cake balls onto the baking sheet. If they won't fit, use a second baking sheet. Dipping the Cake Pops Melt \u00bc cup (45 grams) of the candy coating in the microwave. Put the candy coating into a small, microwave-safe bowl, then melt it according to the instructions on the package. Each brand may be a little different.

Poke the lollipop sticks straight down into the Styrofoam block, so that the cake pops are standing upright. Be sure to leave some space between each cake pop. Melt another \u00bc cup (45 grams) of the candy coating, and use it to \"glue\" the chocolate chips on to make the ears.

You will need about \u00bc cup (45 grams). You will use this to attach the decorations in this section. Simply dip the end of a paintbrush into the melted candy, then use it to make dots where you want the decorations to go. Make the bow. Make two dots of melted candy at the base of one of the ears. Press two heart-shaped sprinkles into the candy, with the points touching. Next, make a dot of melted candy between the two hearts, right on top of the points. Press a small confetti dot or mini M&M into the glue. For a small bow: use two small heart-shaped sprinkles, and a small confetti dot. Be sure to match the colors. For a large bow, use two large, red, heart-shaped sprinkles, and a mini red M&M. Add the nose. Make a dot of melted candy right in the middle of Hello Kitty's face, and press a yellow confetti dot into it. You can also use a small, yellow candy pearl. Alternatively, you can also draw the nose on using a yellow, edible ink pen. Make the eyes. Dip a thin paintbrush into dark-colored food coloring, and draw two small ovals to either side of the nose. Hello Kitty's eyes are low, so make them just above the nose. They are also wide apart, so leave some space between them! Alternatively, you can draw the eyes on using a black, edible ink pen. Draw the whiskers. Using a thin paintbrush and dark food coloring, draw three whiskers on each side of Hello Kitty's face. Make them short, and as close to the edge of the face as you can. Don't let them touch the nose or eyes! You can also draw the whiskers on using a black, edible ink pen. Serve the cake pops. You can keep them on the Styrofoam block, or you can stand them upright in a nice cup.",
