The robbers are unsure of where the safe is, so they split up throughout the bank. One robber goes to the basement, one goes to the first floor, one goes to the second floor, and the fourth robber stays on the roof as the lookout. The alarm tips off the cops, so the lookout needs to send a signal to the other robbers that it's time to leave. Miraculously, all four robbers get back to the roof and escape in time to get away without getting caught. The 4 Jacks are robbers and the deck of cards is the bank they're robbing. As the trick unfolds, you will move the robbers (Jacks) throughout the bank (deck of cards). The magic of the trick is that all 4 robbers will escape to the roof of the bank (top of the deck) in time to get away. The cops are a part of the story of the card trick, and actually have nothing to do with the cards. As long as your story still makes sense with the trick, you can alter this story or add any details that you'd like."
