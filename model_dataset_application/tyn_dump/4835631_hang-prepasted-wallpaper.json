Read the instructions that come with your wallpaper very closely. Each paper is slightly different. When in doubt, use the specific directions rather than general directions for wallpapering. Prepping the Walls and Supplies Purchase or rent a complete set of supplies according to the list of things below.  Ask if you can rent a basswood table from the wall covering shop. To make your own, rest a three by six-foot (0.9m by 1.5m) piece of three-fourths inch (1.9cm) plywood on top of two sawhorses. Sand the corners of the plywood to avoid tearing.

This means the prepasted side, usually white side, should be toward the outside. Fill your water tray with room temperature water. Place it at the bottom end of your worktable.

Laying the paper too soon will cause it to expand on the wall and create gaps. Hanging Prepasted Wallpaper Pick the wallpaper up off your worktable. Ensure the pattern is right side up. Align and apply the top half of the paper sheet to the wall. Use your plumb marks on the wall to line it up. Then, leave about two inches (5cm) of extra paper above the trim to remove later. Slide the paper into position as needed. The size on the walls should allow you to slide it to an exact position. Use a wallpaper smoothing brush or tool to remove bubbles. Brush the bubbles out toward the sides. Repeat until the wallpaper is smoothed to the wall. Repeat with the bottom half of the strip. Always smooth from top to bottom and from the center toward the sides. Wet a sponge and wash off excess paste from the patterned side of the wallpaper as needed.  Trim the wallpaper by holding a putty knife flush with the trim. Cut with one clean motion against the top edge of the putty knife using a utility knife. Keep your utility blade as horizontal as possible as you cut. Replace the blade after cutting the trim off two pieces of wallpaper. Sharp blades are essential to avoid tearing. Apply the rest of your wallpaper in a similar fashion. Make sure you align it with the plumb line and with the previous strips of wallpaper.
