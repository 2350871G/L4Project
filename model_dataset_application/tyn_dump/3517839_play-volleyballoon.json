If some of the team members are much taller than others, like if you\u2019re playing with a mixture of adults and kids, you might want to have the taller players play on their knees. If you\u2019re playing in a classroom, have everyone sit on top of their desks to play. Nobody can leave their desk during a play, but you can rotate desks after each play."
