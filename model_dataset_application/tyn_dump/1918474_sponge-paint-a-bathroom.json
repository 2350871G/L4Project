          "description":"Use a low-gloss paint for the base coat. This will make sure that the shinier latex glaze of the top coat stands out. Make sure your base coat resists mildew. The bathroom has a lot of moisture, what with the shower and the sink, so a mildew-resistant paint is best. You can ask at the paint store for recommendations about which interior paints best resist mildew. Make sure that your base color paint looks good with your top color. A simple way to do this is to pick 2 colors from the same color family (i.e. different shades of red). Alternatively, pick 2 colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, like green and blue. The base coat can either be lighter or darker than the top color. If your base color is lighter than your top color, the 2 colors will look more blended. If your base color is darker, the top color will appear to be floating off of it. This is a lovely look but also shows flaws in the painting more clearly."

If you\u2019re having trouble getting the paint onto an irregularly-shaped sponge, use a paint brush to brush the paint onto the surface of the sponge. Tap the sponge on the wall, turning your wrist side to side as you go. Turning your wrist will vary which part of the sponge hits the wall, which will vary the pattern and texture of the paint. This will make the texture and pattern of each tap a little different, to avoid repetition and add visual interest. You can also try alternating which hand you use to sponge. Dab the sponge lightly to create more detail. Lift the sponge about 1 in (2.5cm) off the wall with every tap. Then turn the sponge slightly and place it on a nearby bit of wall. Overlap the edges of each sponged area slightly as your tap. This way, your wall will not look polka-dotted. Instead it will have an even top coat of sponged texture. Rinse the sponge and reload with paint. Rinsing gets rid of dried-up paint in the pores. Dried-up paint would make the pattern blotchy, so rinsing will keep it clear and crisp. Once you\u2019ve rinsed the sponge, wring it out and reapply the paint, either by dipping the sponge in the paint or by brushing on the paint with a paint brush.
