Adding Roofing Cover the rafters with OSB and shingles if you want it to match the home\u2019s roof. Nail OSB sheets into the rafters using a nail gun.

This is a highly waterproof material that looks nice next to any other roofing materials. OSB is a type of engineered wood made of compressed layers of wood strands, kind of similar to particle board. This is a good option if you attached the deck cover to the side of the home. Cover the rafters with corrugated plastic for a translucent protective roof. Lay out overlapping sheets of corrugated plastic roofing over the rafters. Pre-drill holes every 16 in (41 cm) through the sheets where they will lie on top of the rafters and nail them into place with aluminum screw nails. This is a good option if you want protection from the rain and weather over your deck, but still want some light to shine through. Nail a wooden trellis to the rafters if you want to let vines grow over the cover. Lay out pieces of wooden trellis over the rafters so that the structure is completely covered. Nail them into place with carpentry nails and a hammer or using a nail gun. Put nails every 16 in (41 cm) or so along each rafter. This is a nice option if you just want to add some shade to your deck but keep it more open to the air. You can then put planters with vines next to the corner posts and let them grow up the posts and onto the trellis to add some nature to the deck.",
