  "text":" Clean the Wood Stove Remove oil, graphite, or other burned-on substances from the surface of the stove. Put on eye protection and gloves. Use a clean, white rag and pour a small amount of trisodium phosphate onto the surface to be cleaned. Scrub the surface with the rag to remove all dirt, or use a wire brush for heavier debris. Wipe the surface with another clean rag. Remove excess oil. Use a lacquer thinner instead of trisodium phosphate for very oily stove surfaces. Apply with a clean, white rag and scrub the surface. Use another clean, white rag to wipe it down. Remove stubborn, chipped paint. Use medium-grit sandpaper on areas of the stove that have paint bubbles or stubborn chipped paint that can't be removed with the rag. Lightly sand the stove until it is as smooth to the touch as possible. Paint the Wood Stove Prepare the spray can. Shake the paint can vigorously for 2 minutes. This \"stirs\" the paint and distributes it evenly. Test the aerosol spray plug by spraying for 1 or 2 seconds onto a newspaper or other disposable surface. When the color comes out and the stream is good, the paint is ready for application. Paint the surface of the stove. Place on eye protection and gloves to avoid stains on your hands. Hold the spray 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the surface to be painted. Use a sweeping motion to cover an area of the stove in 1 streak. Continue to cover the surface in 1-stroke sweeps until it is covered. Do not keep your hand on the spray nozzle the whole time you are painting, and do not use a circular motion, as this will cause the paint to be unevenly distributed. Allow the paint to air dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, as brands will vary.  Cure the Paint Use the heat from your stove to cure the paint. Curing occurs when you heat your stove to seal the silicone resin in the paint, which is what contains heat-resistant properties. Heat your wood stove to a temperature of 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow the stove to cool. Repeat the curing. Reheat your stove to a temperature of 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) a second time, and allow it to remain on for 20 minutes. Turn it off and allow it to cool. Heat the stove a third time. Heat the stove to 460 degrees F (237 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Turn it off and allow it to cool.",
