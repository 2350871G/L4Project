Cut 2 joint pieces at 45-degree angles in the same direction (meaning both angled to the left, or both to the right). These joint pieces should fit together to form a flat line against the wall. Most corners will be 90-degree angles. For most corners, cut corner pieces at 45-degree angles in opposite directions (one to the left and one to the right, so that they fit together). For corners that are very different from 90 degrees, measure the angle with a protractor, and divide this number by 2 to determine the angle of your cuts. If your quarter round will end at an obstruction, cut at a 45-degree angle and attach a quarter round return."

Steady the miter box with your non-dominant hand, and hold the saw in your dominant hand. Apply pressure with the saw and move it back and forth over the quarter round until your cut is finished. A miter box and saw set can be purchased at most home improvement stores, or online. Remember to wear gloves and protective eye wear. Always exercise caution when using a saw."
