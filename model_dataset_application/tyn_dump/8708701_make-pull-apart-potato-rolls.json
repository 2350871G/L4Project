You can also use a standard potato masher, mixer, or fork if you do not have a ricer. Make sure the potatoes are thoroughly mashed with no remaining lumps. Making the Dough Mix milk and potato in a stand-up mixer. Using a stand up mixer with the whisk attachment, combine 1 cup (237 ml) of whole milk and \u00be of a cup (177 ml) of mashed potato. Continue to mix until there are no lumps remaining. Add the melted butter. Then, add \u00bd a cup (118 ml) of melted butter and continue to mix until the butter has been completely incorporated.

Brush the dough with melted butter and then cover and let stand in a warm location for approximately 30 minutes. During this time the dough will expand about 1 \u00bd times the original size. Constructing the Potato Rolls Divide dough into 18 pieces. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and then divide the dough into 18 equal parts. Roll each piece into a ball. Then, using your hands roll each of the parts into a ball and place them on a buttered pan. The baking pan should be 9x13 inches (22x33 cm). Place the dough balls close enough together so that they touch. This way when you are finished baking them you will have to pull apart the rolls. Brush with butter and let the dough rise. Brush the rolls with melted butter and then let them sit, uncovered, for an additional hour. The rolls should almost double in size during this period. Baking the Potato Rolls Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). While the rolls are left to rise, you can begin to preheat the oven. This can be done when the rolls have approximately 15 minutes left to rise. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/d\\/d2\\/Make-Pull-Apart-Potato-Rolls-Step-13.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d2\\/Make-Pull-Apart-Potato-Rolls-Step-13.jpg\\/v4-190px-Make-Pull-Apart-Potato-Rolls-Step-13.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":307,\"bigWidth\":\"190\",\"bigHeight\":\"127\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Bake for 15-20 minutes.
