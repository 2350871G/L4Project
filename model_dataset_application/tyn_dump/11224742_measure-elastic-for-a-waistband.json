You might wrap the tape measure around your waist at a point about 3 inches (8 cm) below your navel for traditional low-rise pants, for instance. Then, read the measurement.Tip: Try to wear pants or a skirt that fits close to your skin and remove any bulky jackets or tops that might make it difficult to take an accurate measurement. If you don't have a fabric measuring tape, wrap a string or piece of yarn around your waist. Then, use a ruler to measure the length of string."

Unwrap a length of your elastic and mark a length of elastic based on your measurement. Then, cut the adjusted measurement.

If it feels comfortable, you can begin sewing your waistband. If it's uncomfortable, adjust the elastic size and try it on again. If the elastic slides down too much, cut the elastic shorter. You may need to cut an extra 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) off of the elastic. If the elastic is too tight, move it higher up on your waist or use a longer piece of elastic."

Instead, place a small piece of excess fabric from your project underneath the elastic band ends. Then, press the ends together and zigzag stitch them so they're attached to the excess fabric. Trim off the excess fabric before you pin the elastic to your waistband and sew it in place using a zigzag stitch."

Close the safety pin and hold the non-pinned end outside of the casing while you feed the pinned end through it. It will be easier to feel and pull the safety pin than just the end of the elastic. Once the elastic is completely through the casing, remove the safety pin and gather the ends together so they overlap by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Then, sew the ends together using a zigzag stitch before you sew the casing closed with a straight stitch."

This flexible elastic is really soft so it's also great if you plan on sewing the elastic waistband directly onto your fabric. You can also use knit elastic if you're sewing the waistband into a casing.

If you're sewing the waistband directly onto the fabric, decide if you want to buy fashion elastic that comes in bright colors or patterns.

          "description":"Although elastic comes in several widths, you'll probably want the elastic to be between \u20444 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) wide. Keep in mind that the width will vary depending on whether you're sewing it directly onto the fabric or into casing.Tip: Think about how high you'll want the garment to sit on your waist. For most adults, narrow elastic that's around \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) may cut into the skin or be more likely to twist if it's low on the waist. For example, if you're sewing an exposed waistband, you might want it to be over 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. If you're making clothes for kids, get elastic that's closer to \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide."
