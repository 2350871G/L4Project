Pick an area of your property to plant your tomatoes where they\u2019ll be exposed to 6 or more hours of sun each day. Till the soil and mix in some manure, compost, or fertilizer. Then purchase some transplants from a local garden center, dig holes in the soil that are about 4 feet (1.2 m) (1.2 m) apart from each other, and put the root part of the plants inside.

This allows the plant\u2019s leaves to grow and protect the tomatoes from the sun. Potted tomato plants need support, too. Use a single stake or a tomato cage that will fit in your pot. Spread a layer of mulch on top of the soil to prevent mold. Because caged tomatoes are leafier, they\u2019re more susceptible to mold and fungus.

Place the wire cages overtop of each plant and push the \u201clegs\u201d on the bottom of the cage into the ground. This will keep the cage stable. Whether your tomato plants are newly-sprouted seedlings or hearty transplants, do this immediately after planting to keep from damaging the plant\u2019s roots. Pull the stems through the cage as the plant grows. The horizontal wires on the cage are what provide support to the tomato plants. Check on each plant\u2019s growth every few days. When the plant has grown tall enough to reach the next horizontal wire, gently pull that part of the plant through the cage so that it can rest on the wire.

Once the weather gets cooler and there aren\u2019t any tomatoes to harvest, pull the cages out of the ground and spray them down with a cleaning solution. Let them air dry and then stack them up in a cool, dry garage or barn until spring. Make an easy cleaning solution by mixing 9 parts water and 1 part bleach. Trying Other Supporting Methods Support your plants with a trellis. Wire trellises combine the concepts of single stakes and cages.

While keeping it attached to the spool, use garden twine to tie a loop around the base of a tomato plant. Then unravel the spool while you wind it around the plant 2-3 times. Continue unraveling the spool until the twine is long enough to reach the top of the trellis. Then, cut and tie the twine to the top of the structure. Try the Florida weave. Install posts just like you would with a wire trellis, and then tie long pieces of tomato twine around one of the end posts at multiple heights. Then weave the twine around the other posts and ultimately tie them to the post that\u2019s furthest away on the other end. Tie a loop around the base of each plant with one end of a new piece of twine and tie the other end to the topmost woven piece of twine that makes up the structure. This way, the plants will grow up and in between the twine. Use tripods and tuteurs in windy areas. Get three large 6-foot (1.8m) stakes made of wood or bamboo for each tomato plant. Wrap 2-3 thick, elastic bands around the tops of all 3 stakes and insert each end into the ground around the outside of the plant.
