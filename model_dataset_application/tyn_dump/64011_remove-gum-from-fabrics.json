Clear a space in your freezer so you can set the folded clothing in it. Leave the clothing in the freezer until the gum hardens. Depending on how thick the gum is, you may need to freeze the clothing for an hour or two. Avoid covering the clothing with something that the gum may stick to. You can simply put it on a shelf of the freezer."

Wash the fabric as usual, but check it before you dry it. If there's still a stain, treat the stain again. If you dry the fabric while there's still a stain, you may set the stain.

Mineral spirits are also called white spirit and mineral turpentine. Use the mineral spirits in a well ventilated area and avoid touching the soaked cloth with your bare hands since mineral spirits can irritate your skin.
