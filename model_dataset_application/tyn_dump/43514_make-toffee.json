Once it's lightened in color, use a plastic spatula to spread the chocolate evenly across the surface of the toffee, making a two-layered chocolate-toffee treat. Freeze as usual.

Then use a food processor to finely chop another 1/2 cup of nuts and pour them on top of the toffee when it is still hot (or the chocolate, if you chose to add it on top). Freeze as usual.

This is called a double boiler, as the hot water surrounding the pot melts the chocolate, not the direct heat of the stovetop.

Sweet, salty, and savory, bacon toffee is hard to resist. To make it, simply fry, dry, and finely chop 1lb of bacon. Then lay the small pieces on your baking pan and pour the toffee over them. Use your toffee in cookies and other baked recipes. Crunch your toffee up and use them alongside chocolate chips in chocolate chip cookies.
