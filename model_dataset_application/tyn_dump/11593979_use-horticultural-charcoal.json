Check if the soil requires watering by sticking a wooden skewer into the soil. If the skewer comes out completely clean, the soil is dry and needs to be watered. If the skewer comes out wet with soil attached, the soil still has moisture left. If you live in a very dry and arid location, you may need to water some of your plants more often.

    "Insert your plant into the soil and fill the pot.",
    "Once there\u2019s enough potting soil in the pot, add one or more plants.",
    "Use more potting soil mix to fill the space between the plant(s) and the edges of the pot.",
    "Push down at the base of the plant(s) to make sure it\u2019s securely in the soil and the soil is slightly compacted.",
    "If there\u2019s space between your plants, also fill that space with more potting soil mix.",
    "Water your newly potted plant and check moisture with a skewer.",
    "Use only a small amount when you water the plant.",
    "Add between \u20444\u2013\u20442 cup (59\u2013118 mL) of water to start for small pots and slightly more water for larger pots.",
    "Under normal conditions, water your plant every 1-2 weeks.",
    "Check if the soil requires watering by sticking a wooden skewer into the soil.",
    "If the skewer comes out completely clean, the soil is dry and needs to be watered.",
    "If the skewer comes out wet with soil attached, the soil still has moisture left.",
    "If you live in a very dry and arid location, you may need to water some of your plants more often.",
    "It is much better for plants to be under-watered than over-watered.",
    "Applying Wood Ash to Lawns and Gardens Burn untreated wood in an outdoor fire pit or indoor fireplace.",
    "Only burn wood that is not pressure-treated, painted, or stained.",
    "Do not include any other items in the fire, such as cardboard or trash.",
    "Add a small amount of wood to get your fire going; once it\u2019s hot and well-burning, add more wood as needed.",
    "You can allow the fire to burn itself out if you\u2019re able to keep an eye on it or if it\u2019s in a protected area.",
    "Otherwise, dump water on the fire to completely extinguish it before leaving the area.",
    "Always keep a bucket of water and a hose (turned on) near any outdoor fire pit.",
    "Do not burn wood when the fire conditions are high and fires are banned.",
    "Hardwood produces more ash than softwood.",
    "Shovel the ash into a wheelbarrow for easy distribution.",
    "Once the ash is cool and dry, shovel it into a metal wheelbarrow so you can transport it around your yard.",
    "You may want to use eye protection and a face mask as the ash will be quite dusty.",
    "If you aren\u2019t going to use the wood ash right away, don\u2019t allow it to sit in one place on the ground.",
    "Instead, scoop it into a fireproof container that has a lid (such as a metal garbage bin).",
    "Piles of ash will produce salt, which can seep into and destroy the soil.",
    "Never pile the ash anywhere you want to be able to grow something in the future.",
    "You can also use the ash that\u2019s accumulated in your indoor fireplace, as long as you\u2019ve only burned untreated wood.",
    "Scatter the wood ash onto your recently watered lawn.",
    "Estimate the square footage or squared metres of lawn that you have.",
    "Use a hose and wet your entire lawn (unless it rained and the ground is still wet).",
    "Sprinkle or scatter between 10\u201315 pounds (4.5\u20136.8 kg) of wood ash per 1,000 square feet (93 m) of lawn.",
    "Spread it evenly on the lawn, then rake the whole lawn once the ash is spread.",
    "Do not spread wood ash on a windy day, as it will get into your eyes and mouth very easily.",
    "Wear protective equipment on your eyes, nose, and mouth when spreading the ash.",
    "Do not spread ash on your lawn if you\u2019ve recently seeded.",
    "Work wood ash into the soil of your flower and vegetable gardens.",
    "Use a shovel, hoe, or garden rake to mix wood ash into the soil of your garden.",
    "While you can mix the ash into your soil at any time of the year, the best time to do it is before you\u2019ve planted items for the seasons.",
    "The wood ash will increase the pH of the soil and neutralize soils that are too acidic.",
    "Do not use wood ash in gardens where you\u2019re growing potatoes, blueberries, rhododendrons, or azaleas.",
    "Do not use wood ash around plants that prefer acidic conditions.",
    "Do not use wood ash in soil that already has a pH value of 7 or higher.",
    "Add wood ash to your outdoor compost regularly.",
    "Wood ash will add much-needed nutrients to your outdoor compost bin.",
    "Keep the wood ash in a fireproof container (with a lid) near your compost pile and add a scoop or two whenever you dump in green material (kitchen scraps, leaves, etc.).",
    "Do not add too much wood ash all at once, as it may raise the pH level too quickly and kill helpful bacteria and worms.",
    "Making Your Own Biochar Select and obtain a burner or stove in which to make the biochar.",
    "Determine which option works best for you based on cost, convenience, capacity, and safety.",
    "One option you have is to purchase a stove that\u2019s specifically designed to make biochar (usually called a wood or biomass gasifier).",
    "Another option is to purchase a cone stove (also known as a Japanese kiln).",
    "Check with your local fire code to make sure the burner or stove you want to use is allowed.",
    "In general, biochar is charcoal that\u2019s produced by burning biomass material (in this case, wood) at low temperatures with very little oxygen.",
    "The process, called pyrolysis, keeps most of the carbon in the charcoal.",
    "Wood ash, on the other hand, is produced by burning biomass materials at high temperatures with oxygen.",
    "The process, called incineration, produces a lot of carbon dioxide as the carbon from the biomass is released.",
    "Collect dry organic green waste to turn into biochar.",
    "Almost any type of yard waste can be used to make biochar.",
    "However, the most useful items are those that are of consistent size.",
    "For example, breaking down logs, sticks, and branches in a wood chipper will produce an excellent product for making biochar.",
    "If necessary, you can also purchase woodchips commercially to turn into biochar.",
    "While you can technically use any \u2018green\u2019 item to make biochar, avoid using plants that are used to grow hedges (such as oleander).",
    "These plants produce toxins to help them survive, which may not completely burn off in the biochar making process.",
    "Water down the area around your burner or stove.",
    "Your biochar stove or burner will produce temperatures much higher than a typical campfire or bonfire.",
    "To reduce the chances of a wildfire starting in the area around your stove or burner, use your garden hose to drench everything around it.",
    "Also, soak the ground under your stove or burner.",
    "Keep your garden hose nearby and turned on throughout the process.",
    "Keep a bucket full of water nearby as well.",
    "Fill your biochar stove or burner with dry kindling.",
    "This can include small branches and sticks, as well as dry leaves and grass.",
    "Use a lighter or match (or fire starter if needed) to light the kindling on fire and get it burning.",
    "Add more kindling, if necessary, to keep the fire going.",
    "The goal here is to get a good, hot fire going inside the stove or burner before you add the wood.",
    "Add your biochar material to the stove or burner.",
    "Once the kindling has created a good-sized fire within your stove or burner, start adding the actual wood you want to use to make biochar.",
    "Add this wood consistently.",
    "If a lot of smoke is produced, slow down the rate at which you\u2019re adding the wood.",
    "If you notice a lot of ash is being formed, speed up the rate at which you\u2019re adding the wood.",
    "Keep adding wood until the stove or burner is full.",
    "Biochar is formed when the wood is burned at very high temperatures without a lot of oxygen.",
    "Therefore, you want to load the stove or burner as much as possible to reduce the number of air pockets.",
    "Add a lid or cover the burner or stove with soil.",
    "Once all the wood is added and the fire is hot enough\u2013when the flames look blue\u2013place a lid on the stove/burner (if it has one) or add a layer of soil on top of the burning wood.",
    "Some stoves/burners may instruct you to add a second layer of wood material that will keep the lower layer of burning wood hotter than the top layer.",
    "Read the instructions for the stove or burner you purchased to make sure you follow any specific steps required for it.",
    "Allow the biochar to burn until it starts to produce smoke.",
    "The wood needs to burn at a high temperature in order to turn it into biochar.",
    "Depending on the type of stove or burner you\u2019re using, you may notice a lot of smoke at one point, which indicates the burning is complete.",
    "For other burners or stoves, the end of the process may simply occur when there\u2019s nothing left to burn and the fire goes out.",
    "Do not touch the stove at this point without using welding gloves or gloves that are heat resistant.",
    "Regular oven mitts will not be enough.",
    "Leave the biochar to cool or drench with water if required.",
    "If you need to leave the area, drench the biochar and the stove/burner with water to ensure all flames are out.",
    "Then leave the biochar to cool and dry.",
    "If you can watch the area at this point, you can allow the biochar to air cool.",
    "It can take anywhere from several hours to a day or two for the biochar to cool, depending on how tightly packed it is in the stove or burner.",
    "You can move the biochar to another container to cool.",
    "However, if you choose to do this, make sure it\u2019s a fireproof container and that you use welding gloves.",
    "Shovel the biochar into a container for storage.",
    "Once the biochar is cool, you can use it right away or you can store it for use later.",
    "If you want to use it right away, shovel it into a wheelbarrow or bucket, add compost, and use your shovel to mix the two items together.",
    "Once mixed, you can use the biochar in your garden the same way you used wood ash.",
    "If you want to store the biochar, use a shovel to put it into a fireproof storage container that also has a lid.",
    "An ideal storage container is a metal garbage bin and lid, which will keep your biochar dry and safe until you need it."
