Continue rubbing the stick back and forth until the entire crack is filled in. Some other options are stain markers and blending pencils.

Get it as level with the surrounding wood as possible. Don\u2019t worry about spreading the filler material past the crack. It is easy to remove as long as it doesn\u2019t have time to dry.

Wipe along the wood\u2019s grain as much as possible to reduce the possibility of adding new scratches. Be careful not to disturb the material in the scratch. An easy way to level the filler material and get all the excess is with a solid edge, like a credit card. Hold the card vertically against the wood, then drag it across the scratch. Use a rag to pick up the filler. If the filler begins to dry before you clean it all up, dampen a rag with mineral spirits. Make sure the rag isn\u2019t dripping, then scrub along the wood\u2019s grain over the excess wax."

Hold the knife horizontally and move it across the crack to level out the filler. To avoid scratching the wood, use a plastic knife instead of a metal one. Latex wood filler is similar to traditional wood putty, but it holds shape in deep scratches more efficiently. Get some online or at a home improvement store. Another option is to use a similarly-colored wood stain. Dip a rag or paint brush into the stain, then spread it along the inside of the scratch. Continue adding more until the scratch is filled.

Set out a palette, then open the paints starting with the lightest color available. Drip a little of each paint onto the palette and blend them together with a palette knife. If your wood consists of a few different shades, match the paint to the lightest one. Wax paint is often sold in stick form, which melts when held over heat like a candle or lighter flame. The paint itself is often available at craft stores in addition to some home improvement stores and online. For an alternative to wax paint, try oil-based or acrylic paint."
