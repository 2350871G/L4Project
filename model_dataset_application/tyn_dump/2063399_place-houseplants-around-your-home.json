Use these experiences to reorganize your houseplant setup to keep your plants alive and well. If you have trouble keeping your plants alive, try raising a few sturdier plants. Succulents are incredibly hardy and nearly impossible to kill. Cacti can thrive without needing very much water.

Flowering plants may need different temperature or sunlight requirements in order to bloom successfully. Windowsills can become drafty during the colder months of the year. During this time, pull any plants you have resting there away from the window by a few inches. Similar draft problems can occur for plants that are located near entrances to the home.
