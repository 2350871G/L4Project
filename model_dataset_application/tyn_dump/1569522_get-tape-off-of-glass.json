Taking the time to read product labels and using the solvent it in a well ventilated area may prevent unnecessary accidents when removing tape from glass.

If you have any questions, contact the company at the phone number given on the label. Make sure the area you use the solvent is well ventilated. The fumes may be dangerous if inhaled for too long. Open any windows in the room or use a fan to bring in fresh air. If you don\u2019t have any windows or a fan in your area, try and remove the glass to an area that is well ventilated. Consider taking a break every few minutes to get some fresh air. Keep the solvent and its container away from children, pets, and flames."

Try soaking the glass in hot or boiling water if a hairdryer doesn\u2019t work. Leaving the glass in the water for 30-40 minutes may soften and dissolve the tape and adhesive enough so they simply wipe right off. Fill a sink with hot or boiling water. Be sure to not burn yourself. Place the glass in the sink and leave it for 30-40 minutes. If the glass is too large to put in the sick, soak a dishcloth in the water and place it directly on the taped area. Leave it for the same amount of time. Wipe off the tape and any residue.

You likely have olive oil as a staple in your diet, now you can put it to work against tape and adhesive. Try other vegetable oils such as canola or safflower if you don\u2019t have any olive oil on hand. Apply a few drops of oil over the area with tape and let it sit for a few minutes. You can also soak a paper towel with the oil and leave it on the glass. This allows the oil to penetrate the tape and adhesive.

Mix equal parts baking soda with a vegetable oil, water, or lemon juice until it forms a paste. Rub this paste onto the area with tape and leave it on for a few minutes. Wipe the paste off with a clean cloth. The tape should come off relatively easily. If there is any lingering tape or residue, use one of your kitchen scrubbers to remove it. You don\u2019t have to worry about using a new one, as a baking soda paste is natural and safe to use. Consider soaking your glass in boiling water for 30-40 minutes before rubbing on the paste.

    "Leave diluted vinegar on the tape for a few minutes to let it work its magic.",
    "Mix one part water to one part vinegar.",
    "Then soak a dishrag in the solution.",
    "Either wrap the cloth around the glass or set it on top of the glass.",
    "You can also safely hold it in place with your hands if you can\u2019t set the glass on the ground.",
    "Allow the mixture to penetrate the tape and adhesive for a few minutes before you remove the cloth.",
    "You\u2019ll likely notice that the tape is much less sticky.",
    "Wash the class with a dish soap and warm water to remove any lingering tape or residue.",
    "Rub on a baking soda mixture.",
    "Baking soda is an abrasive that can help pick up bits of tape and residue.",
    "Mixing it with an oil or acid such as lemon juice makes a natural paste that can scrub off and remove tape from glass.",
    "Mix equal parts baking soda with a vegetable oil, water, or lemon juice until it forms a paste.",
    "Rub this paste onto the area with tape and leave it on for a few minutes.",
    "Wipe the paste off with a clean cloth.",
    "The tape should come off relatively easily.",
    "If there is any lingering tape or residue, use one of your kitchen scrubbers to remove it.",
    "You don\u2019t have to worry about using a new one, as a baking soda paste is natural and safe to use.",
    "Consider soaking your glass in boiling water for 30-40 minutes before rubbing on the paste.",
    "This can remove paper or other materials that may be stick to the tape or adhesive."
