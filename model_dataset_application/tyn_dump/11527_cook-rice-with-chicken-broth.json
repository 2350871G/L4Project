Then, follow your machine's instructions or use the \"rice\" button. Keep in mind that the chicken broth contains salt, so you won't need as much salt as you usually use. You could use low-sodium broth if you're watching your salt intake. To add a richer flavor, saut\u00e9 1 chopped shallot in 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (28 g) of butter over medium heat before you put the rice in the pan. You could also add 1 smashed clove of garlic with 2 sprigs of fresh thyme."
