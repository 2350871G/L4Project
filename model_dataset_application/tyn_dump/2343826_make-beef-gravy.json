Gravy with Pan Drippings and Flour[2]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Pour the pan drippings into a measuring cup.

Note that this recipe for beef gravy can only be prepared if you cooked a roast, steak, or other cut of beef that produced adequate pan drippings. Skim the fat. Remove the fat from the top of the pan drippings using a spoon. Reserve 2 Tbsp (30 ml) and discard the rest. Transfer the 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of reserved fat to a small saucepan and set aside. Add broth or stock to the drippings. Pour enough beef stock or beef broth into the removed drippings to create 2 cups (500 ml) of liquid. If desired, you could use water, milk, or cream instead of the stock, but beef stock or broth will create a stronger beef taste. Combine the flour and reserved fat.

The combination of fat and flour is referred to as a roux. For a thicker gravy, use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of flour. Gradually add the drippings. Slowly pour the combination of pan drippings and broth into the roux, whisking continually to prevent lumps of flour from forming. If possible, whisk and pour at the same time to maintain more even control over the consistency of the gravy. If this is too difficult, however, you can alternate back and forth between adding the drippings mixture and stirring it in. Thicken the gravy. Bring the gravy to a boil and stir until it thickens. Do not cover the saucepan. Season the gravy. Add salt and pepper to the gravy, as desired, in order to season it. Stir well to incorporate the seasonings. If you are uncertain about how much to use, try adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper. Serve warm. Pour the beef gravy into a gravy boat and serve with your meal.
