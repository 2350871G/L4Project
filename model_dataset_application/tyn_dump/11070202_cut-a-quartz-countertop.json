The average distance for an overhang is 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), but you can choose to add between 1\u20136 inches (2.5\u201315.2 cm).Tip: If you want your countertop to be flush with a stove or refrigerator, don't add overhang measurements to the sides where you'll insert an appliance.

Some sinks come with a template that you can outline on your countertop to help you cut. When you're installing your sink, you'll rest it in on top of a fitted hole that you'll cut out for it, so don't measure the very edge of your sink.

Instead, use painter's tape and wrap it around the edges where you're going to cut, and then set up your guide rail to cut a square out of the middle of your sink's outline. A plunge saw is also known as a track saw. Line up the back of your saw blade with any corner of your sink's outline. There is a slot or marker on the side of your plunge saw where your blade ends in the back. Release your blade all the way up so that it isn't sticking out through your base plate, and line up the corner of the sink with this line. You'll usually have about a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin of error. A lot of sinks don't have form-fitting lips that you need to cut perfectly into. Attach your plunge saw to the guide rail. The guide rail that comes with your plunge saw has groves in it for you to insert the plunge saw. After you've lined up your guide rail with the grease marking, put your saw on top of the guide rail and lock it into place if it has a locking mechanism. Drop your plunge saw slowly and begin to guide it forward. Put both hands on the handles on top of your saw, and slowly lower the blade into your quartz.
