          "description":"How you prep your driftwood for preservation depends on what you\u2019re using the driftwood for. If you want to clean the driftwood up, remove any weakened pieces of the driftwood. Either put on gloves and remove the pieces by hand, or use a chisel or scraping tool to break off the sections you want to remove. You may want to do this if you\u2019re preserving a single piece of natural driftwood or don\u2019t want any weak chunks of wood snapping off when you\u2019re sculpting it."

          "description":"To smooth the wood out, grab a sheet of 180- to 300-grit sandpaper. Put on a set of thick work gloves. You can sand the surface of the wood by hand, or use an orbital sander to remove the exterior layer of wood. This will give your driftwood a smooth, soft texture.The amount of pressure you use when sanding is totally up to you. The harder you press the sandpaper into the wood, the smoother the finish will be. Some people prefer the look of rougher driftwood, though. Don\u2019t forget the other side of the wood. If you\u2019re sanding one side of the wood, you should sand the other side as well to make it consistent."

          "description":"Take your driftwood outside and grab a stiff-bristled brush. Scrub the wood with the dry brush to knock off any dust, dirt, or weak layers of wood. Use an air compressor to blow the wood dust and debris off. The more dirt, sand, and debris you can knock off, the more effective the bleaching process will be.You can use some canned air instead of the compressor if you don\u2019t have one. Make sure that you scrub and blow air on the opposite side of the wood, too!"

          "description":"Get a plastic trash can or storage bin that is big enough to hold your chunk of driftwood. You\u2019re going to fill this bin with water and bleach, so make sure that you have at least 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) of space at the top. Gently set the driftwood in the bottom. Do this outside if possible. The bleach fumes can be obnoxious and you\u2019ll soak your wood for a few hours. If it may rain, wait for a clear, sunny day to do this."

          "headline":"Submerge the driftwood in a solution of bleach and water.",
          "description":"If you want to dye the driftwood white, fill your bin with a solution of 9-parts water and 1-part bleach. If you want to preserve the original color and grain, use 1 cup (240 mL) of bleach for every 5 gallons (19 L) of water instead. Fill the bin with enough of your bleach solution to completely submerge the driftwood.Tip: You have to do this if you want to preserve the driftwood. The bleach kills off any bacteria or pests that are hiding inside of the wood. Bugs and bacteria tend to build up inside driftwood, which will cause it to rot over time. Bleaching and cleaning the wood removes all of that junk. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water if you get any bleach on your skin."

If this happens, place a ceramic tile, brick, or some other heavy object on top of the driftwood. The entire piece of wood must be submerged for this process to work."

          "description":"Let the bin sit out in the open air for at least 6 hours. This should be more than enough time to remove the bacteria and pests living in the wood. However, if you want to dye the wood white, leave wood in the bleach and water for as long as it takes to change color. If you have to let it soak for more a day, change the bleach and water solution out after 24 hours.The longer you leave the wood, you whiter it will turn. You\u2019ll get diminishing returns after 3-4 days, though. The younger the wood is, the longer it takes to change color. You may need to keep the wood submerged for 2-3 days to dye it white."

If it\u2019s a bigger piece, pour the water and bleach out into a dirt patch or large sink to retrieve the wood. Pull the wood out and let it sit on the driveway, sidewalk, or some other solid surface. Let it rest in the sun for at least 24 hours before rinsing the wood thoroughly with a hose.This will give the bleach time to dissipate into the wood, which will preserve it for longer. When rinsing the wood, you can use cold or warm water. Either way, be sure to really soak the wood. It\u2019s key to washing off any bleach residue that sticks to the external surface, which you don\u2019t want."

This will give the moisture trapped inside of the wood time to completely dissipate. On days when it may rain or snow, take your wood inside and let it dry in the garage, basement, or the corner of some unused room.You can stop here if you\u2019d like. Driftwood that has been cleaned and bleached should hold up just fine for years before it starts to flake or fall apart."

This is particularly important if you\u2019re using an epoxy resin to finish the driftwood, since it\u2019s usually spread out by hand.These finishes aren\u2019t toxic, but you can put a dust mask on if you tend to be bothered by the smell of chemicals."

Move the bowl or cup toward the other end of the wood to spread a thick bead over the surface. Either spread the epoxy out by hand or use a brush to move it over the wood until you\u2019ve applied a thin layer of resin.Let the resin dry for at least 72 hours to fully cure to the wood. The thicker the epoxy layer is, the more plastic and reflective your wood will look. Some people really like this look, while others prefer to keep the wood looking as natural as possible.

Get a varnish or stain and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to apply it to your wood. Typically, this is done by applying 2-3 layers of the liquid with a paint brush.Wait 48 hours for the wood to completely dry after applying a varnish or stain. Driftwood is extremely porous\u2014even more so than other varieties of wood. It may take multiple layers of a thinner varnish or stain to actually see the layer on the surface of the wood.
