The most common surfaces for stucco are plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), cement board, and exterior grade gypsum sheathing. Make sure to follow local building codes while installing the sheathing material. It is possible to stucco over an open frame, but this results in a less even and less structurally secure wall. If you plan to go this route, drive nails halfway into the studs, spaced out vertically in 5-6 inch (13-15 cm) intervals. String line wire horizontally along the protruding nails."

          "description":"You may also use a draining house wrap such as Tyvek drainwrap. Most building codes require at least 2 layers of \"Grade D\" building paper or an equivalent water-resistant barrier. You may also use 15 lb per 100 square foot roofing felt (6.8 kg per 9.3 square meters) or some types of housewrap, but do not use a plastic housewrap not intended for stucco. Overlap the paper by at least 4 inches (10 cm) and fasten with roofing nails. Start at the bottom and overlap the paper or felt as you work your way up. While not required by most codes, an air gap between the 2 layers is highly recommended to prevent wall rot. A 3D plastic drainage mat between the 2 barriers is one way to accomplish this."

In most cases, you should nail or staple the lath to the studs (not the sheathing) at no less than 7-inch (18 cm) intervals. Overlap the lath by at least \u00bd inch (1.25 cm) along the long side and 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the end, but not much more. Be sure to use only galvanized roofing nails or staples designed for use with stucco. Otherwise, your nails or staples will rust and pull loose. In all exterior stucco applications, you must use G-60 hot-dipped galvanized lath. Choose lath with at least \u00bc inch (6mm) furring, or make up for non-furred lath using furring strips or furring nails. Without this furring, the stucco will not adhere properly to the lath."

Also install control joints wherever 2 dissimilar walls meet. If the lath is expanded metal (rather than stucco mesh), cut it behind each control joint to fully separate this rigid material into panels. Make the panels as close to square as possible, and no larger than 144 ft (13 m)."

If you choose to do this, plan on a total stucco thickness of about \u215c inch (9.5 mm) for cast concrete, and \u00bd inch (12.7 mm) for unit masonry.

    "Cover with the finish coat.",
    "This final \u215b inch (3 mm) layer determines the texture of your stucco wall.",
    "Apply and float it as you did the brown coat, but this time use 1 part cement to 1\u00bd to 3 parts sand.",
    "You may purchase a finish which already contains pigment, or trowel on a plain finish and paint over it once it has had at least a week to cure.",
    "Colored stucco finishes work best in pastel shades.",
    "If the finish is colored, wetting the surface during floating may cause mottling.",
    "A fog coat may make the color more even.",
    "Many decorative textures are possible when applying this final layer.",
    "Judge the appearance from at least 30 feet (9m) back before settling on a look.",
    "Applying Stucco Over Concrete or Masonry Prepare the wall's surface.",
    "You may apply stucco directly over these rigid, solid surfaces, but only if the surface is roughly textured and absorbent.",
    "If the wall does not absorb a sprinkle of water, or if there's obvious surface contamination, wash the surface thoroughly.",
    "If the wall is coated in paint or sealer, or if it's too smooth to support stucco, try one of the following treatments:\nAcid etching.",
    "Sandblasting.",
    "Bush hammer or roughing machine (for unpainted, smooth surfaces).",
    "Applying a bonding agent, referring to specific product instructions.",
    "Do not use a bonding agent over water-soluble paint.",
    "If there is any doubt that the wall can support the stucco, apply the stucco as you would to a stud wall, attaching metal lath and plastering over it.",
    "Wet the surface.",
    "Wet the wall right before you apply the first coat of plaster, preferably with a fog spray.",
    "This improves the suction bond and reduces the amount of water the wall absorbs from the plaster, preventing premature drying.",
    "The surface should be damp, but not soaked.",
    "Delay the job if the next week of weather involves freezing temperature, hot weather (above 90\u00baF / 32\u00baC), or high wind.",
    "These conditions will interfere with the curing process.",
    "Mix the scratch coat.",
    "This coat should be 1 part cement material (including lime) and 2\u00bc to 4 parts sand.",
    "Plastic cement, which has been pre-mixed with lime, is usually the easiest to mix and work with.",
    "Combine this with plaster sand from a dry material yard.",
    "Only add enough water to allow you to trowel the plaster, or it may sag or fail to stick to the wall.",
    "Apply and score the scratch coat.",
    "Trowel on a layer \u00bc inch (6.4 mm) thick.",
    "Score this with shallow, horizontal lines using a notched trowel, keeping the tool perpendicular to the wall.",
    "These grooves will help the next coat bond onto the surface.",
    "Acid-etched surfaces (among others) may not be quite rough enough for a strong bond with this method.",
    "Instead, dash on the scratch coat using a cement gun, or by whipping it on with a fiber brush or whisk broom.",
    "This forces out air to create a stronger bond.",
    "Some builders combine the scratch coat and brown coat into one base coat.",
    "If you choose to do this, plan on a total stucco thickness of about \u215c inch (9.5 mm) for cast concrete, and \u00bd inch (12.7 mm) for unit masonry.",
    "Allow about \u00bc inch (6.4 mm) of this thickness for the finish coat.",
    "Apply the brown coat after a few hours.",
    "With modern cement on a rigid surface, there is no need to wait for the scratch coat to cure completely.",
    "For a stronger bond, trowel on the second, \"brown\" coat as soon as the scratch coat is rigid enough to resist cracking, usually after 4 or 5 hours.",
    "Rod and float this surface until it is level and \u00bc inch (6.4 mm) thick.",
    "The brown coat mix should contain 1 part cement materials and 3 to 5 parts sand.",
    "It may help to compact this layer with a shingle float.",
    "Keep the brown coat moist while it cures.",
    "Over the next 48 hours, it is critical to keep the stucco moist.",
    "If the relative humidity of the air is below 70%, you will need to mist or fog the surface once or twice a day.",
    "Wait at least 7 days for the brown coat to cure, wetting periodically if it begins to dry prematurely.",
    "Some organizations recommend 10 or even up to 21 days of drying for even more crack resistance.",
    "In extremely hot or windy conditions, put up a windbreak and sun shade.",
    "You may even need to cover the moistened surface with polyethylene.",
    "Put on the finish coat.",
    "The decorative finish coat contains 1 part cement materials and 1\u00bd to 3 parts sand.",
    "Optionally, it may include pigment as well to add color.",
    "Trowel and float this on in a thin layer, about \u215b inch (3 mm) thick.",
    "Allow it to cure completely before painting (if desired), following the same moist curing instructions above if the weather is hot.",
    "If you\u2019re not experienced with applying textured finishes, a texture roller is a great option for achieving high-quality results.",
    "Apply the roller evenly over the final coat."
