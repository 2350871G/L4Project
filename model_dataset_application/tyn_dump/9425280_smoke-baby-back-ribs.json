  "text":" Trimming and Seasoning the Ribs Trim off the membrane from 3 to 4 slabs of baby back ribs. Insert the tip of a butter knife underneath the thin, white silver membrane to loosen it a little. Take a paper towel and use it to grip the silver membrane.

If you don't have the time, you can begin smoking the ribs instead. Setting Up the Smoker Arrange the briquettes for a burn-down. Get out an 18 pound (8 kg) bag of charcoal briquettes. Dump enough unlit coals to fill the charcoal bed of the smoker or the grate of the grill. Light and add hot coals. Take a handful of coals and put them in a chimney.

Heat the grill or smoker between 225 \u00b0F (107 \u00b0C) and 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C). Many smokers will have a thermometer installed or you can place one in the smoker. Check the temperature to ensure that it's between 225 \u00b0F (107 \u00b0C) and 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C) before you smoke the ribs. Smoking and Saucing the Ribs Arrange the ribs on a grilling rack. Once the grill or smoker has heated, set a grilling rack in it. Set each rack of seasoned ribs into the rack so there's 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space in between the racks. If you can, position the grilling rack over indirect heat. For example, try moving the grilling rack to towards the side of the grill or smoker so it's not directly over the hot coals.

Adjust the temperature until it reaches 225 \u00b0F (107 \u00b0C). Smoke the meat and add coals every hour for 4 hours.

Use tongs or gloves to lift the rib racks and lay them flat on the grill grate. Take a grilling mop and dip it into your favorite barbecue sauce. Coat the meat side of the baby back ribs with the sauce. Turn and coat the other side in sauce. Use tongs to flip the rib racks over. Dip the grilling mop into more sauce and slather the other side of the ribs in the sauce. You can keep flipping and saucing the ribs as much as you like. Serve the ribs. Once you've coated the ribs in enough sauce according to your taste, transfer them to a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut in between the rib bones and set the ribs on a plate.
