You don\u2019t need to remove the fixtures if you\u2019re only replacing single tiles that aren\u2019t in the way of your fixtures.

Make sure the tub drain is completely covered if you\u2019re removing shower tiles so none of the pieces get stuck in your pipes.

Cut through each line of grout around the tile so you\u2019re able to pry it out of place. Work through the grout around 1 tile at a time so it\u2019s easier to remove.

Tap the other end of the chisel with a hammer to force the chisel under the tile and remove it from the wall. Work completely across each row from top to bottom. Put on work gloves and safety glasses to protect yourself from any tile shards or sharp edges. Wear long pants while you\u2019re working since the tiles could fall and cut you.

Apply a firm amount of pressure so it firmly adheres to the thin-set and make sure the tile stays straight so it doesn\u2019t appear crooked. If you need to apply more pressure to the tile, lightly tap it with a rubber mallet until it sets into place. Set a level on top of the tile to make sure it\u2019s flat on top of the thin-set. If it\u2019s not, apply pressure to the raised sides. Continue adding tiles to your floor with spacers in between them. Work in horizontal rows across your bathroom floor so you can ensure your tiles stay straight. Spread more thin-set on the floor when you need it and place the next tiles adjacent for the first one. Check that the tiles are level with one another before sliding 1-2 spacers between them so they stay the same distance apart. Place the same number of spacers between all of your tiles so the floor looks uniform and even. You can buy spacers that also help level your floors to make your workload easier. Work from the furthest corner of your bathroom toward the door so you have an easy way to get out when you\u2019re finished laying the tiles. Spread grout in the spaces between the tiles once the thin-set is dry. Leave the thin-set to dry for at least 24 hours before pulling the spacers out from between your tiles. Mix your grout following the package\u2019s instructions and scoop some out with a rubber grout float. Push the grout float diagonally into the spaces between your tiles to force the grout between them. Check that the top of the grout is even with the top of the tile and fills in the space completely. If the application looks uneven, then wipe out any excess with a shop cloth. You can buy grout from your local hardware or home improvement store. Don\u2019t use a regular trowel for spreading your grout since you may scratch or damage your new tiles. Wipe away excess grout with a damp sponge. About 20 minutes after you apply the grout, wet a sponge under warm water and wring it out so it\u2019s damp to the touch. Carefully clean the tiles on your floor to remove any grout that\u2019s still on their surfaces. Be careful not to remove any of the grout between the tiles since it still may be wet.",
