  "text":" Making the Dough Pour 1/4 cup of warm water into a large bowl. Add your package of active dry yeast and a pinch of sugar. Set the mixture aside for five minutes. Add the olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper to the bowl. Add an additional cup of warm water. Add the all-purpose flour to the mixture one-half cup at a time. Stir with your wooden spoon as you add flour. Continue stirring with the spoon until the dough starts to come away from the sides of your bowl.  Flour a clean hard surface lightly. Turn the dough out. Knead it for eight minutes. Add extra flour if the dough is too sticky. Roll the flour into a ball. Pour 1/2 tsp. of olive oil into a new, clean bowl. Place the dough ball in the bowl and roll it around till it\u2019s covered. Set the dough aside in a warm place for one hour to rise. Keep it on the counter with a tea towel draped over the top of the bowl. Preparing the Filling Chop your tomatoes with a very sharp knife. Set them in a strainer over the sink. Replace the tomatoes with one cup of marinara sauce if you are short on time. Sprinkle the mixture with salt. Let it sit and drain for 30 minutes. (Marinara sauce does not need to be drained in this step.) Drain your anchovies and set them in a mixture nearby.  Slice your mozzarella into 16 pieces; one for each panzerotti. You will assemble each one after the dough is rolled and divided. Remove the dough from the bowl. Divide it into four pieces. Keep the remaining three pieces covered. Divide each of the quarters into four even quarters. You will have 16 pieces of dough in all. Roll each piece into a four inch (10 cm) circle on your lightly floured surface. Do this one piece at a time to avoid drying out the dough. Spoon one tsp. of tomatoes inside the round. Then, add a slice of mozzarella and an anchovy on the side. Turn one side of the circle to meet the opposite side in a half moon shape. Press the edges together with a fork. Repeat with the remaining pastries. Place them on a plate near the stovetop. Cover them with a towel. Frying Panzerotti Heat two cups of vegetable oil in a deep fryer, heavy frying pan or cast iron skillet. There should be at least one inch (2.5 cm) of oil in the bottom of the pan. Heat to 370 degrees Fahrenheit (180 Celsius). If you\u2019ve not well acquainted with frying food, you can use a cooking thermometer to get an exact temperature. Test the temperature by throwing a bread cube in, and waiting one minute to see if it\u2019s fried. Adjust your heat if it fries too fast or too slow. Drop two to four panzerotti into the frying pan. They should not touch. Fry for about a minute and a half on each side. They should be golden brown. Cover a plate with paper towels. Set the fried panzerotti on them to drain. Serve immediately.
