This sets the view or the perspective of the drawing. The front view will look larger and the back side of the Church will look narrow. This narrowness shows that the Church is small or big. The more narrow it gets from front to back, the bigger the Church appears. Draw the lines keeping the Church's walls in mind. The lines of the walls will start straight and end in a slope depending upon your design in mind."

As you progress, check the original Church image if you have one. If you are drawing a Church on your own with your imagination, then it will appear like your imaginative Church.

You may make a colorful display on the doors and windows to make your drawing look more aesthetic and beautiful. Add some details on it. Create lines that will form different kinds of shapes for the window."

Outline the drawing with a darker sketch pen or charcoal pencil depending upon your choice of colors. If you are not very proficient with coloring you may use crayons or pencil colors and make very light strokes. As you color, you may play with the light and darker colors. A hint to color well is to assign an area where light falls. Like sunlight will not be alike on the east and the west. Hence, one side will be dark, another will be lighter."

If you make dark strokes of color which is showing horizontal and vertical patches of color, it may not look very appealing. Make the colors blend and maintain the coloring strokes in a flow."
