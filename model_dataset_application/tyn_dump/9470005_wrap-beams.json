Have someone hold the tape measure at one end of the beam while you run it to the other end to check the length. You\u2019ll probably need to stand on a ladder or other safe surface to reach the ceiling. Use only a ladder that has 4 feet (1.2 m) that sit flat on the floor.

It\u2019s usually sold in large pallets, but let the store know you\u2019re looking for a small lot. They may have some leftovers that will be perfect for your job. If the leftover or scrap flooring is a little beat-up, that can actually make your wrap look even more authentic. You can find flooring for about $3 per square foot. So, if you want to wrap a beam that is 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide on the sides, and 4 inches (10 cm) by 10 feet (3.0 m) long, it will cost about $33."

Check with your local hardware store, and buy at least enough length to cover your beams. A faux beam that is 13 feet (4.0 m) long will cost about $200."

Likewise, if one piece of your material isn\u2019t enough to cover the beam, cut another piece. For instance, if your beam is 6.5 feet (2.0 m) long, and your lumber is 5 feet (1.5 m) long, cut another piece that is 1.5 feet (0.46 m) long to have enough to cover the whole thing. Sand the cut edges before continuing. If you don't like the look of the seams this creates, you can cover them with metal brackets or straps after you finish wrapping."

Preparing Your Material Cut your lumber to size, if necessary. If your faux beams or lumber are longer than the beam you want to cover, cut the pieces down to the right size with a ripsaw, circular saw, or table saw.

If you\u2019re using new wood, brush two coats of stain or paint on all sides, in whatever color you want. Let it dry for 24 hours before assembling the pieces over your beam. Covering the Beams Glue down the flooring pieces, if you\u2019re using them. Flooring can be applied directly to the beam, just by laying enough pieces to cover it. Spread wood glue on the back of each piece, then tack it in place with finishing nails. Cut pieces as necessary to cover the whole beam.

Don\u2019t forget to cover the sides as well. Put nails every 6 inches (15 cm) along each side of each board. Set the faux beams in place with screws, alternatively. Have someone hold up one end of the faux beam, while you hold the other. The open side of the three-sided faux beam should slip right over the existing beam. Place screws every 6 inches (15 cm) along the edges of the beam where it meets the ceiling. Add metal straps, if desired.
