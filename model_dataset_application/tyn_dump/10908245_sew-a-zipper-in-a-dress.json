          "description":"Use a tape measure to measure the area where you want the opening on your dress to be. Consider how far down you want the opening to go. If the dress is form-fitting, then a longer zipper is best since this will reduce stress on the fabric when you put on or take off the dress. Zippers range from 7 to 22 in (18 to 56 cm). Opt for a zipper that will go from the top of the dress to just below the hips. This will likely be around 16 to 20 in (41 to 51 cm) depending on the wearer.Tip: If you are following a pattern to make your dress, make sure to check the pattern for a zipper size, type, and color recommendation."

          "description":"Select a zipper that is meant for use in dresses and that will match the dress material as closely as possible. If the dress is a print, then choose a zipper in a complementary color, such as a hot pink zipper for a dress that has a lot of hot pink in the print. Even if you plan to hide the zipper with the fabric at the dress\u2019s opening, choose a color that will blend well with the dress. Black is often a good choice for dark dresses and white is a good choice for light-colored dresses. Dress zippers are often more delicate than the ones you see in pants and on handbags. They also come in a wider range of colors and lengths."

Then, sew another zigzag stitch across the zipper opening about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) below this point for extra security. Cut the rest of the zipper off 1 in (2.5 cm) below this stitch. Be careful not to sew through the zipper teeth. Adjust the zigzag stitch to the widest setting and sew back and forth into the fabric beside the zipper teeth\nYou can also hand-sew across the zipper using a needle and thread, if you prefer. Thread a needle with a matching color thread and sew back and forth across the zipper teeth where you want the zipper to end. Stitch across the zipper teeth 7 or 8 times to ensure that the new zipper ending will be secure."

Position the top of the zipper along the top edge of the dress and mark the location of the bottom of the zipper on the wrong (inner) side of the dress fabric. Note that this mark indicates where the zipper pull will come to, not where the zipper\u2019s fabric ends. If you adjusted the length of your zipper, then use the position where you stitched across the teeth as the end of your zipper. Use a fabric marker or chalk to make this mark.
