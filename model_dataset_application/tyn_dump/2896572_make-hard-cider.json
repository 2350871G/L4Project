          "description":"Apple juice and yeast are the only essential ingredients, but there are a few other ingredients that can be added in order to alter the final product. You can either use apple juice or apple cider. Many prefer the taste of pasteurized, sweet apple cider, but you could use fresh apple juice just as easily. Note, however, that unpasteurized juice will need to be sanitized before you can ferment it. Dry wine yeasts are affordable and effective. Beer yeasts are also affordable, and many beginning cider makers find them easier to work with. Specialized yeast packages specifically labeled for use with hard apple cider are also available but tend to be more expensive. Pectic enzyme helps clear cloudiness and is often used with heat-brewed cider. Adding sugar to the cider will product a higher alcohol content. The extra apple juice is only needed if you plan to use a starter."

Pour your apple juice into a resealable container with a tight lid. Pour half of your yeast into the apple juice, seal the container, and shake well for a few seconds. When bubbling occurs, release the pressure inside the container by opening the lid. Note that it may take five to six hours before bubbling starts. Reseal the lid and place the container in the refrigerator overnight. Remove the starter a few hours before you brew your cider."
