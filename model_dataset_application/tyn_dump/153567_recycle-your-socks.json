  "text":" Creating a Dust Rag Pull the sock over your hand. Fuzzy socks work best because the texture picks up dust and hair better than smooth socks. Simply stick your hand inside the sock. Dampen the sock. While fuzzy socks can pick up a lot when dry, other socks cannot. Run the sock under the faucet or add furniture polish. You don\u2019t need a lot, only enough to cover the outside of the sock. Wipe dust off your surfaces. The sock is ready to be used. Go and wipe it over any surface where dust has collected. When it looks like the sock is too full of hair and dust to pick up more, brush it off over a trash can or turn it inside-out to continue dusting. Wash the sock. Throw the sock in the washer and dryer cycle with the rest of your laundry. Your sock will come out fresh and ready to use again. Making a Muscle-Relaxant Pack Fill the sock with rice. The best socks for heat packs are long ones without holes. Add four cups (946.4 mL) of non-instant white rice or other heatable food, including dried corn kernels and flaxseed, to the sock. The amount of filler you use can be adjusted. Less for example makes the heat pack softer and able to be used to focus on smaller areas on your body. Tie a knot at the top of the sock. Wrap the end of the sock so that you can twist it into the knot. This keeps the filler from spilling out and giving away heat. Microwave the sock. Limit the amount of time microwaving to one minute at a time and no more than three minutes. The sock can get too hot and the filler can burn. The sock should feel warm to the touch but not painful. Keeping a cup of water in the microwave next to the sock will slow down the heating process. Place the sock on your body. Now that the sock is warm, it is useful for treating cold, sore, or painful spots. Drape the sock on the painful muscle or area or press it against the area you wish to treat. Turning a Sock into a Drink Cozy Measure the length of sock you need. If you have a specific size you need, such as for your favorite coffee container, break out the tape measure. Hold it up to the cup. Measure only the part you want covered by the cozy, then add an inch (2.54 cm). Measure up from the toe of the sock. If you want the cozy to bunch up a little, add extra length to your calculation. Cut off the top of the sock. When you get to the end of the length of sock you need, remove anything above it by cutting across with scissors. At this point, you may be able to use the sock as an undecorated cozy. Turn the sock inside-out. Reverse the sock. Working with the less attractive inside of the sock will leave you with a better-looking cozy later. Fold the sock downwards. Find the end that\u2019s going to be the top of your cozy. Take the top and fold it downwards about one inch (2.54 cm). Sew the hem. Use a sewing needle to secure the bottom of the folded part to the rest of the sock underneath it. If you don\u2019t want to sew, you can also place bonding tape between the parts of the sock and iron them together or use fabric glue.

It is a good idea to apply a little bit of fabric glue around the edges of the hole to protect the threads from fraying. Crafting a Draft Protector Add corn kernels to a sock. Pour the cup (236.6 mL) of dry kernels or other heat-absorbent foodstuff, such as dried beans or peas, into the sock. Let it settle at the bottom. Place quilt batting in the sock. Add an equal amount of fluffy stuffing as you did foodstuff. Quilt batting is a heat-absorbent stuffing found at craft stores. You can substitute in another stuffing, such as that from an old pillow.

You may need to create one or two more draft protectors, depending on the length of sock. Repeat the steps to fill these socks with half corn kernels, half stuffing.
