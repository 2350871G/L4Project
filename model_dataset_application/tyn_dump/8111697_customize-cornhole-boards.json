Remove any unused equipment, tools, and cords, as these can be spattered with paint or become tripping hazards as you work. Paint on a level, sturdy surface, like a work bench. An outdoor work surface can be made by putting a flat board between two sawhorses on level ground.

Use a medium grit sandpaper (60 - 100 rating) to remove burrs, splinters, and rough patches in the wood. Sand until the wood is completely even and smooth. After you are finished sanding, take a rag dampened with water and wipe away any dust or sawdust, then allow the wood to dry completely. To prevent missing spots when sanding, it helps to work methodically. For example, you might work from the front of the board to the back, from top to bottom."

Mix the primer according to its directions, take a clean paintbrush, and dip the brush in the primer. Wipe excess primer onto the inside lip of its can, then:\nPrime the wood from top to bottom, using long, even, overlapping strokes. This will prevent drips from forming and ensure even coverage. Pay close attention to edges and joints in the board. These spots can often be difficult to prime. Allow enough drying time between coats.

Long, even, overlapping strokes will provide better coverage and prevent drips from forming.
