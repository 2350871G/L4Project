          "description":"Use a sturdy pair of scissors to cut equally-sized strips of paper from each piece of paper. You can adjust the size a bit according to your preference -- adjusting the width of the strips will make the garland loops wider and adjusting the length will make the loops longer."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Form one strip of paper into a loop.",
          "description":"Simply create a loop by making the flat strip round, and touching the edges of the paper so that they are overlapping by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). The most dependable way to make the strip stay in loop form is to glue the ends of the strip together and wait for the glue to dry before you move on. But if you don't have the time or patience to individually glue each garland, you can also tape the loops together using clear masking tape. If you're really pressed for time, you can even staple the ends of the loops together twice. Remember that if one loop falls apart, the garland will disconnect."

Connect the ends of the second loop just as you did with the first loop. If you're going for alternating colors, make sure you pick a different color for the second loop."

          "description":"Continue running each strip of paper through the previous loop and then connecting it to make a loop until you've connected all of your loops and have created a paper garland of interlocking loops. If you'd like your garland to be a bit longer, just cut more strips of paper and create more loops until you're satisfied with the length."

Cut circles that are at least three different sizes -- anywhere from a 3 inch to a 6 inch (7.6 cm to 15.2 cm) diameter will do. You don't have to use each color of paper equally, and you don't have to cut the same amount of each size of circle. The easiest way to cut the circles is to use a circular punch; you can also just trace a circular pattern on the back of each piece of paper and cut it with scissors."

Place this pattern near your sewing machine so you'll be easily able to feed it."

Then continue to feed each circle into the machine, followed by the next one in the pattern you've chosen, until they are all connected by the thread. You can leave a few inches or centimeters between each circle, or spread them apart further or closer together. They don't need to be evenly spaced or sown right down the middle. As long as the circles are connected and catch the eye, you'll have a spectacular paper garland. Make an end stitch on the last circular shape."
