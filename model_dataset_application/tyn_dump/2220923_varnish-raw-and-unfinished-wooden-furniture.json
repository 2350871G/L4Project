  "text":" Prepare a work area that is well-ventilated. The room or workshop you will be working in has to be the correct temperature so that the varnish will dry properly\u2014at least 70\u00b0F (21.1\u00b0C). Keep your piece of furniture out of direct sunlight so that the varnish doesn\u2019t dry too fast.  Smooth all rough surfaces with a very fine grade of sandpaper. Sand with the grain; if you sand against the grain, you will damage the wood. Clean the furniture thoroughly after you have sanded it. Vacuum the piece and the area around it. (If possible, sand the piece in a separate room). Wipe down the furniture with a clean, lint-free cloth. Remove dust and dirt from cracks with a clean, dry brush to make sure your furniture is free of all lint, dirt and dust. You can also blow dust and dirt from the piece with a hand-held hairdryer. Use the cool setting. Wipe down the entire piece with a tac cloth to make sure every particle of dust and dirt is gone. A tac cloth looks like cheesecloth and is a bit sticky to the touch; it can pick up tiny bits of lint that would otherwise get trapped underneath the varnish. Choose a brush that is especially made for applying varnish. The brush must be clean. Purchase varnish and mineral spirits. Buy a large enough can of varnish so that you have enough to cover the furniture piece. Check the label on the can to be sure of the coverage amounts. Buy a large clean container with a wide mouth if you don\u2019t have one on hand. You will need this separate container to thin out the varnish. Hold the varnish can and rotate it gently a few times to mix the varnish.  Open the can of varnish and pour a measured amount into your empty, clean container. The amount of varnish depends on the amount of surface area you need to cover. Put the lid back on the varnish can immediately so that no dirt or dust falls into the can.  Measure the same amount of mineral spirits as you did varnish.  Slowly pour the mineral spirits into the varnish you put into the wide-mouthed container. Stir the varnish and the mineral spirits with a clean paint stick. Stir slowly and steadily until the two substances are completely mixed. Dip your brush into the thinned varnish.  Hold the brush over the container and allow the excess varnish solution drip back into the container.  Brush the varnish onto your bare furniture using long, straight strokes.  Brush with the grain, not against it. Apply the varnish evenly and thinly. If your varnish starts to thicken, add some more mineral spirits to thin it. Allow the first coat to dry overnight. You will have to sandpaper your first coat, but you can\u2019t do that until the varnish is completely dry. Test for dryness by lightly rubbing a piece of fine sandpaper on the varnished furniture.
