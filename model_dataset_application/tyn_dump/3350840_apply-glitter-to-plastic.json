This will remove any oils and residues that might prevent the decoupage from sticking. It will also remove any sanding dust, if you sanded the item. You should do this even if you cannot wash the item. There is not enough rubbing alcohol to damage the item."

          "description":"Use a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a thick coat of glossy-finish decoupage glue (i.e. Mod Podge) to the item. Run your brush over the surface again to remove any brushstrokes. If you are covering the entire item with glitter, consider coating just half of it with glue for now. This way, you'll have something dry to hold on to. If you are covering a plastic cup, stick your hand into the cup. This way, you can coat all of the sides without getting your hands dirty. You can also try using regular white school glue or even acrylic craft paint. Keep in mind that you won't be able to apply a second layer with paint, or you will dull the glitter."

Wait 1 to 2 hours for the first coat to dry, then apply more decoupage glue and glitter over the entire item. You can use a different type of glitter to create an interesting texture.
