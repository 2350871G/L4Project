Due to the fact that silk stretches, you'll want to gently pull your thread taut to pre-stretch it after you snip your length free from its spool. This will prevent your necklace from stretching longer than you intend. For the purposes of providing a guided example, a 5-foot (1.524 m) length of silk thread will be used. This length is sufficient for a 16 to 20 inch (40.64 to 152.4 cm) knotted strand. Generally, necklace lengths are broken down accordingly:12 - 13 inches (30.5 - 33 cm): collar length. This necklace will lay across the middle of the neck without much loose line.14 - 16 inches (35.6 - 38.1 cm): choker length. A classic style that encircles the neck comfortably.17 - 19 inches (43.2 - 48.3 cm): princess necklace length. One of the most common lengths, well suited for plunging necklines.26 - 36 inches (66 - 91.4 cm): opera necklace length. A lower hanging length of pearls that will hang about to your sternum."

Beading mats and trays are specialty tools used by serious beaders, but these can also make your pearl necklace making experience more efficient. Stringing Your Pearls Thread your needle and string your pearls. You'll want to use a thin wire needle, which should fit easily through your pearl holes, to string pearls one at a time onto your thread. If you have a special pearl you plan on placing centrally, or different varieties you plan on using in a pattern, remember that your pearls will be strung in reverse fashion - the first pearls on the line will be at one end of your line, and the last pearls at the other. Verify the thickness of your string against your pearls. You should check the width of your thread by passing the threaded wire needle through a pearl and then back again. If the needle can't pass through the hole, a smaller size thread would likely suit your situation best. The line is generally considered to be too small if a pearl can slip over an overhand knot. Thread your first clamshell tip. Thread your needle through one of your clamshell tips and string it all the way to the end knot connecting the loose ends of your line. Once your knot is nestled inside the clamshell tip, add a dab of glue and close the clamshell tip to close off that end of the line. Tie an overhand knot to separate your pearls from the tip. Pearls can deteriorate over time if rubbed against a hard surface, like your metal clamshell tips. By tying a knot between the clamshell tip and your pearls, you'll increase longevity. String your pearls and knot in between. Take your threaded needle and, one by one, string your pearls on the silk line of your necklace.
