Put the grill pan with the seared chateaubriand in the center of your oven. Roast the chateaubriand until it reaches 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C) to 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C).

Continue to whisk in the rest of the softened butter 3 tablespoons (42 g) at a time until it's slowly combined with the sauce. The sauce will thicken as you whisk. Turn off the burner and stir in salt, pepper, and tarragon. Once the sauce is thick enough to stick to the whisk, turn off the burner and whisk in salt and pepper according to your taste. You'll also need to whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons (3 to 5 g) of fresh minced tarragon leaves. If the sauce isn't as thick as you'd like it, continue to cook it over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Serving the Chateaubriand Slice the chateaubriand. Use a sharp carving knife to cut the meat into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm)-thick slices. To ensure tender slices, remember to cut against the grain. Plate the slices of meat. Divide the chateaubriand slices among 4 serving plates. If you prefer to let your guests serve themselves, set the meat on a serving platter in the center of the table. Store leftover chateaubriand in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. Spoon the b\u00e9arnaise sauce over the meat. Use a ladle to spoon sauce directly on the slices of meat.
