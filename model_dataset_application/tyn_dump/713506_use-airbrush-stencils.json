That way, any stray paint will end up on the tape rather than on your work surface. If you\u2019re painting on thin paper, be cautious about using masking tape.

You may need to hold the airbrush at least 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) away from the surface you are painting to get broad enough coverage and make sure you do not overload the stencil."

For example, you might begin with one paint color at the top and then make the transition to another color at the bottom to create a gradient or ombre effect. Make several passes with the airbrush if you want darker paint, or just a few passes if you want a lighter effect."

If there\u2019s any underpaint (i.e., areas where the paint seeped in under the edges of the stencil), you may be able to correct it with a little paint that matches the color of the background.

Some templates have interior details, meaning that they act like a cross between a template and a negative stencil. If this is the case, make sure to pass your airbrush over the whole template to fill in any open spaces in the design.
