In most suburban and rural areas, gathering your materials should literally be as easy as picking it up off the ground, especially during the fall and winter seasons. If you don\u2019t live in a wooded area, search for downed branches around the trees at a local park. Pass up any branches that look especially brittle, or are too misshapen to be practical. You\u2019ll only need one or two good pieces of wood to make a set of buttons, so there\u2019s no need to gather a big bundle."

Old or diseased wood tends to be dry and will often crack and splinter when it\u2019s handled. Young, green wood, however, may contain too much moisture, which can make it pulpy and resistant to shaping. Try to find branches that are firm, healthy and have a rich, tan wooden color inside. Oak, birch, pine and fir are just a few types of wood useful for crafting projects. Gray, lifeless wood should be discarded. It will likely break during the cutting or drilling process. The same goes for wood that is covered with moss or lichens. This may be a sign that the wood is rotten."

If you want, you can strip the branch of bark prior to cutting it into the slices you\u2019ll use to make your buttons. Use a pocket knife to whittle away at tough park, or pry old bark off by hand.

Carefully cut the branch into slices between \u215b and \u00bc of an inch thick. Keep your free hand away from the saw blade as you work. Saw the branch into as many segments as you desire, depending on how many buttons you plan to make. The power of an electrical saw will save you time and result in an ultra-smooth cut, while being forced to go slower with a manual saw can help you fine-tune your cuts and correct potential mistakes. You have a little freedom in how thick you want each button to be. Just remember that if you plan on sewing them onto your clothes, they\u2019ll need to be able to fit through the buttonholes."

If you\u2019ve stripped the bark from the branches, focus on the buttons\u2019 rough outer edges while sanding.
