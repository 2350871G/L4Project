Remove both cakes from the pans. Using a sharp knife, cut the round cake in half. The pieces will have one straight side and one rounded side. Assemble the heart. Turn the square cake at an angle so that one corner is pointing directly towards you. Take the two pieces from your halved round cake and place them at the top of your square so that the straight sides line up with the straight lines of the square. The cakes should resemble a heart. Frost and decorate. Cover the top and sides with frosting. Frosting will help keep your heart pieces together and give a uniform appearance to the cake. Decorating the Heart-Shaped Cake Add decorative icing. After you've already covered your cake with a layer of frosting, use a squeeze tube of icing to add a design or text. To change the color of your icing, add food coloring and stir well. Add more food coloring until you get your desired shade. Make heart-shaped designs on your cake. Use a stencil or free-hand to sprinkle chocolate chips, non-pareils, or sprinkles in a heart-shape on top of your cake. A heart-shaped cookie cutter is also a useful guide for outlining heart decorations. Add flowers. You can either pipe decorative flowers with frosting or use real flowers for a natural touch. Use ribbon. Take nice satin ribbon and run it along the bottom edges of the cake. This will create a finished look, especially if it's for a special occasion. Be sure to remove the ribbon before cutting the cake. Add fruit. Berries can add a pop of color and a little extra sweetness. Place whole berries on the cake, or slice larger berries and lay them decoratively. Stencil a design. Take a piece of parchment paper and cut out a heart. Place the heart on top of your cake and sprinkle powdered sugar or cocoa completely over the stencil. Remove the stencil to reveal the heart shape. Finished. ",
