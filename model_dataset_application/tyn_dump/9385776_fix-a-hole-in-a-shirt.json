Check to see if you already have any thread that matches your shirt. If you don't, take your shirt with you to a fabric store and find the thread that most closely matches your shirt. If you can\u2019t find an exact match, go with a darker thread rather than a lighter one. A darker color that is still similar to the shirt's color is likely to blend in and not be noticeable. Use a matte thread and avoid thread that is reflective or shiny. Matte thread will be less noticeable."

Pull the thread through the hole until the two ends of the thread are the same distance from the needle. Tie the two ends of the thread together in a knot.

If your shirt has a pocket on it, you can cut a piece of the inside of the pocket that will perfectly match the shirt.
