Since the height from one end of the closet to the other can differ, take the height measurement at the middle and each end of the opening. Use the smallest of the measurements. Measure twice and write the measurements down to take with you. If the top of your closet space has a fascia (a decorative, overhanging accent piece), then make sure you take your measurement behind the fascia where you will install the track. If you have an existing track system that\u2019s in good shape, be sure that it will work with the new doors."

Then use the pre-drilled holes to screw the track down to the floor. If your space has carpeting over a concrete slab, then put a piece of masking tape on the carpet before setting down the track. Mark the tape by poking a pen or pencil through the pre-drilled hole. Then use the marking on the tape to drill your pilot hole through the carpet into the slab before screwing the track down. Be careful if you\u2019re drilling through carpet. The drill bit can easily catch and unwind carpet loops.

  "text":" Preparing the Space Remove the old doors. If you want to install completely new sliding doors, then start by removing the old doors and tracks. Lift up on the old doors until the rollers come off the track. Angle them toward you as you lower the top guide away from the top track. Remove the old tracks. Unscrew the old tracks and pry them off if necessary. For wooden tracks coated with paint, use a utility knife at the edge of the track. This will stop the adjacent paint from potentially peeling up with the track. Clean up the area. Remove any leftover debris. Precision measurements are essential for proper installation. Install a floor liner. If the closet space has carpeting or a rug that sits right next to the door, you should install a floor liner. These inexpensive liners fit beneath the bottom track. They keep carpeting or rugs from binding the door rollers. If you decide to install a floor liner beneath the bottom track, set it in place before you measure to ensure accurate measurements. Measure the space for the doors. Before you even buy doors, measure the space because not all doors are created equal.
