Have the top layer overlap the bottom by 33 inches (84 cm) and cut away extra bag material so that your bag is 33 inches (84 cm) by 38 inches (97 cm). Finally, rub the folded bag material with a terry cloth towel to remove wrinkles and any trapped air. You can make your bag out of mylar or latex; however, mylar is more malleable and thus can be made into a more aerodynamic shape than latex can. You can buy a mylar blanket from a camping or sporting goods store. If you don\u2019t want to build your own blimp bag, you can also buy a mylar balloon off the shelf. Just make sure it meets the dimensions above."

Place the yardstick along the left side of the material, leaving .5 inches (1.3 cm) of room. Iron a seam alongside the yardstick with a continuous sweeping motion. Repeat this process for the right and bottom sides of the material, making sure to leave room for a fill spout the size of a plastic drinking straw in the bottom left corner. When you\u2019re finished, flip the bag over and repeat this ironing process on the opposite side. Place 2 pieces of clear packing tape along the sides of the fill spout. The tape gives the fill spout extra protection."

          "description":"Insert a drinking straw into the fill spout and fill the blimp bag partway with air. Tape the spout to seal it, then leave the bag alone for 1 hour. If its size remains the same after an hour, it has no leaks. If you have a leak, locate it by shining a light on one side of the balloon and looking through the other side to look for light shining through. Make sure you do this in a darkened room. You can patch holes in the balloon with adhesive tape or remove the air from the bag and redo any seams that are leaking. Remove all the air from the balloon before repairing any leaks that are more than .25 inches (0.64 cm) in diameter."

Place the fill spout on the nozzle of the helium tank and hold it firmly with one hand. With the other hand, press on the nozzle to release helium into the balloon. Once the balloon is sufficiently filled, tape the fill spout closed. You only need to fill the bag with enough helium for it to start floating. Don\u2019t feel compelled to inflate it to the greatest possible extent. You can buy a helium tank for filling balloons at many balloon and party shops. If you\u2019d rather not buy a tank, take your bag to a balloon shop and have them fill it for you."

To make sure your blimp will still float, hold it in the air after you\u2019ve attached the tail fin and carefully loosen your grip until you\u2019re no longer holding on to it.
