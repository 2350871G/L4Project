You can find all of these things at any fabric store. You'll also need scissors, pins, a sewing machine or a needle and thread, a tape measure. Cut the elastic into two even lengths.

Add 6\" to 12\" to this measurement to make the suspenders adjustable. This should be how long your elastic straps should be cut. Hold the ends of the straps to your front waistline. Hold the two pieces of elastic at the belt line (where they will be clipped on to the waistband). Take the two ends and bring them over your shoulders. Have someone help you bring the other ends of the elastic straps over your shoulders. Crisscross the two pieces of elastic. Have someone hold the two ends of the straps to your belt line in the back. Each end should go to the opposite sides so that they cross over each other. The two strips will form an \u201cX\" across the small of your back. Once you've done this, take the elastic straps off and proceed with attaching the clips and buckles. Attaching the Clips and Buckles Slide one of the buckles onto one of the elastic straps. Start from the bottom of the buckle and pull up, then down through the other side. Have the elastic extending about 1/4\" out of the buckle. Pull the elastic through again and stitch. Fold the end of the elastic sticking out 1/4\" from the buckle back through the buckle. Then stitch the elastic in place. Insert one clip into one end of the elastic. Put the end of the elastic through the hook and fold it over so that it slightly overlaps the rest of the elastic. The front of the suspender clip should be on the opposite side. Pull the elastic through the buckle. Take the end of the elastic that's open and pull it through the buckle. Insert it through the bottom and then back through the other side. This will make the suspenders adjustable. Insert another clip into the open end of the elastic. Put the end of the elastic through the hook and fold it over so that it slightly overlaps the rest of the elastic. The front of the suspender clip should be on the opposite side. Pin the elastic. Take a pin and pin it through the elastic where it's folded over on itself. This will keep the elastic in place while you sew. Sew through both pieces of elastic. Use your sewing machine or needle and thread to sew the elastic in place. Be sure to back stitch a few times on both ends\u2014this stitching will hold the clips onto the suspenders. Repeat with the other strap. For the other elastic and suspender clips, repeat the same process. Now you have your two suspender straps. Sewing the Back Attach the clips to the rear waistband of a pair of pants. Put on a pair of pants that fit you well. Then attach the two lengths of elastic to the back of the pants using the clips. Crisscross the straps. Bring each strap up and over each shoulder, forming an \u201cX\u201d in the back. Attach the clips in the front. Pull the straps over your shoulders and to the front. Attach the front clips to your pants. Pin together the elastic in the back. Have someone help you pin the two elastic straps together where they meet in the back. This will hold the crisscross in place so you can sew it together. Sew the two pieces together. Take off the suspenders first by undoing all the clips. Use your sewing machine or a needle and thread to sew a diamond of stitches where the suspenders overlap, securing the \"X\" shape. You'll need about 5 stitches in each direction. Making D-Ring Suspenders Gather your materials. For suspenders that meet in the back with a D or O shaped ring, you'll need: 2-4 yards of 1\" thick elastic (depending on your height and weight), one d-ring or o-ring, three suspender clips, thread, a needle, and scissors. Most of this can be bought at any craft store. A d-ring or o-ring can be bought at a hardware store if you cannot find it at a fabric or craft store.. Attach one of the suspender clips. First, you'll make the back piece. Start by running one of the suspender clips about an inch up one end of the elastic. Fold the end back through the clip and then sew it in place. Sew about five stitches. You can reinforce the seam by going back through a few times if you'd like. Attach the d-ring. Next, you'll want to cut the elastic about a foot up from the suspender clip. Then wrap about an inch of the open end of the elastic through the d-ring and sew it in place. Sew about five stitches. You can reinforce the seam by going back through a few times if you'd like. Remember to make the folded over end on the right side, the same side as the back of the suspender clip. Attach two more suspender clips to two new elastic strips. Cut two equal length strips of elastic that are as long as the length of your torso plus half the length of your torso. Slide the clips about one inch down the elastic straps. Fold the ends over and sew them in place. Cut the elastic straps in the front down to size. You'll need a friend to help you measure how much of the strap to cut off. Attach the back suspender clip to the back of your pants and have a friend hold the d-ring in place in the middle of your back. Attach the two front clips to the front of your pants.
