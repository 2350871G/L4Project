They can also be rasterized to remove a segment of the layers. When you rasterize an image, you are basically turning it into a graphic so that you can manipulate it."

Then select part of the image that you want to remove. Hit Delete. From the Menu, select File and Save to save the changes you made. Of all the tools in Photoshop, the Lasso Tool is probably the easiest to understand. With it selected, your cursor will appear as a small lasso icon, and you click somewhere along the side of the text that you want to delete. Continue holding the mouse button and drag to draw an outline around it. When you\u2019re finished, hit delete to remove the text. To better understand layers, you can look at them as simply one image on top of another. Imagine you have a piece of paper and you paint it red. Then you take a piece of clear cellophane and paint a yellow circle on it; lay it over the paper. Now you take another piece of cellophane and paint a word written in blue on it; lay that on top of the yellow circle. So now, you have a red background with 2 layers on that are yellow and blue. Each one is referred to as a layer. This is what Photoshop means when it refers to layers. It\u2019s basically all the separate parts of the whole."
