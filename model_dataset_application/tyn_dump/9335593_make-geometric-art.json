Anchor the needle where you want the center point of your circle to be, then extend the pencil arm to the diameter of your choice. Turn the compass a full 360 degrees to draw a circle. For instance, if you want a circle that measures a total of 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) across, extend your compass arm to 0.25 inches (0.64 cm). To draw semicircles, turn the compass 180 degrees and use a ruler to mark the bottom. You can also use a compass to draw triangles. Mark a point on your page and place your compass needle over it, then draw an arc and mark its two end points. Connect the three dots using a ruler."

You can do this by using a ruler or compass to mark the exact, mirror points of one shape on the opposite side of your page. Alternatively, aim for radial symmetry, where a consistent pattern of shapes will radiate outwards from your central point. To draw something with radial symmetry, draw upwards from your central point and repeat the shape for a full 360 degrees. Snowflakes and mandalas are examples of radial symmetry."

    "Use the ruler to trace your lines carefully and maintain the proper dimensions for your art.",
    "You can also use a protractor, a type of ruler measure the angles of a semi-circle, to measure and draw shapes.",
    "Draw circles with a compass.",
    "A compass is a mathematical instrument with two moveable arms, one with a needle and the other with a pencil to draw.",
    "Anchor the needle where you want the center point of your circle to be, then extend the pencil arm to the diameter of your choice.",
    "Turn the compass a full 360 degrees to draw a circle.",
    "For instance, if you want a circle that measures a total of 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) across, extend your compass arm to 0.25 inches (0.64 cm).",
    "To draw semicircles, turn the compass 180 degrees and use a ruler to mark the bottom.",
    "You can also use a compass to draw triangles.",
    "Mark a point on your page and place your compass needle over it, then draw an arc and mark its two end points.",
    "Connect the three dots using a ruler.",
    "Repeat shapes to create a pattern.",
    "The repetition of shapes and lines is what turns simple geometry into geometric art.",
    "Aim to make a pattern by repeating the same sequence of shapes and lines in a predictable way.",
    "Experiment with different arrangements until you make a pattern that you find enjoyable.",
    "Overlap and divide shapes in your drawing.",
    "Use your compass, ruler, and protractor to overlap shapes over other shapes, or to divide shapes into smaller shapes.",
    "You can make circles intersect by placing your compass needle point on a part of the outer perimeter of one circle and drawing a new circle from there.",
    "You can also use a ruler and protractor to dive a large shape into smaller shapes.",
    "For instance, you can use a ruler to draw a hexagon, then divide it into six triangles by connecting its opposite points.",
    "Play with symmetry in your drawing.",
    "To achieve symmetry in your art, choose a central point and draw identical patterns on either side of it.",
    "You can do this by using a ruler or compass to mark the exact, mirror points of one shape on the opposite side of your page.",
    "Alternatively, aim for radial symmetry, where a consistent pattern of shapes will radiate outwards from your central point.",
    "To draw something with radial symmetry, draw upwards from your central point and repeat the shape for a full 360 degrees.",
    "Snowflakes and mandalas are examples of radial symmetry.",
    "Painting Geometric Art Sketch out your geometric design before painting it.",
    "Draw an exact outline of your geometric design on your canvas in pencil, pressing very lightly on the surface.",
    "Use a ruler, protractor, compass, or any other tools available to ensure that you make even, clean shapes.",
    "Erase and re-draw any lines or circles that look sloppy and unpolished.",
    "Use high quality acrylic paint.",
    "To paint geometric art, forgo watercolors, which are muted and don't lend themselves well to straight lines and distinct shapes.",
    "You should also forgo oil paints, which are bold and distinct but also stain permanently, take a long time to dry, and cost more than other types of paint.",
    "Your best bet is a good quality acrylic paint, which is thick enough for detailed painting, dries quickly, and can be cleaned from clothing and furniture in the event of a spill.",
    "Shop for acrylic paints at an art supply store or online.",
    "Use small brushes to draw lines.",
    "The best way to paint straight lines in geometric art is to use small paintbrushes that allow for better detail and control.",
    "Choose round, pointed round, or small, flat brushes to make distinct geometric shapes.",
    "Carefully draw the outline of your shapes to get the straightest lines and angles possible.",
    "Use tape to paint shapes on a canvas.",
    "Place thin masking tape from one edge of your canvas straight across to its opposite point.",
    "Repeat this as many times as you wish at different angles to achieve the shapes you want on your geometric painting.",
    "If you want to be precise, draw the design in pencil before laying down the tape.",
    "Paint the shapes in between the tape.",
    "Use three of four colors of acrylic paint to color in the shapes formed between the tape lines.",
    "To see how the colors will look together before hand, paint them on a scrap piece of cardboard or thick paper to see the effect.",
    "Paint the canvas carefully to make sure only the right color of paint gets inside of each shape.",
    "in then let it dry and remove the tape.",
    "For the best results, use foam brushes to paint your canvas.",
    "You can purchase a blank canvas, acrylic paint, brushes, and tape at an art supply store or online.",
    "Let the paint dry for an hour or more before removing the tape.",
    "Let the canvas sit untouched for at least an hour so that it can dry thoroughly.",
    "For the best results, place it in a cool, dry room during this time.",
    "Pull away the tape very carefully to avoid damaging your art.",
    "Making a Basic Himmeli Geometric Sculpture Draw your Himmeli geometric sculpture to scale.",
    "Plan out your sculpture thoroughly by drawing it part by part before building it.",
    "Use a pencil and ruler to draw a template design for your Himmeli sculpture, making sure that all of the parts connect.",
    "Keep the measurements in your drawing proportional to the size you intend for your sculpture to be.",
    "Cut straws into even pieces.",
    "Find regular-sized drinking straws.",
    "Measure them and cut each one into an equal number of pieces, based on your template design.",
    "You should be left with several identical building pieces.",
    "Make a triangle by threading twine through the straws.",
    "Thread 3 straw pieces onto a long piece of string.",
    "Bend the string at between each straw to make a triangle.",
    "Pull one end of the straw through one of the straw pieces a second time to close the triangle.",
    "Tie a knot to seal it.",
    "Add 2 more straw pieces to create another triangle.",
    "Thread 2 straw pieces onto the thread extending out of the first triangle.",
    "Using one of the straw pieces that is already part of the first triangle, shape the 2 straw pieces to make a second, upside triangle next to the first.",
    "Again, tie a knot at the end.",
    "Repeat this step until you have only 1 straw piece left.",
    "Add the last straw piece and attach the two ends of the string.",
    "Thread the straw piece onto the long end of the string.",
    "Tie the short end of the string remaining from the first knot you made to the long end of the string.",
    "Make sure that the string is pulled taut to be the same length as the straw piece.",
    "Make a 3-D diamond shape by tying together two loose triangles.",
    "Push together the two loose triangles on one end of the sculpture so that they meet at their top points.Take an extra piece of string and tie them together.",
    "This should leave you with a basic Himmeli sculpture that models the principles of the method.",
    "Experiment with different materials, sizes, and colors.",
    "Use different materials, such as copper tubing and wire, to make Himmeli sculptures.",
    "Play around with tube pieces of different lengths to create more complex designs.",
    "Use acrylic craft paint to decorate your sculptures and make them more dynamic."
