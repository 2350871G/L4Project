As soon as the seed breaks free from the flesh, lift it straight out by lifting up the knife, bringing the seed with it. Peeling an Avocado Half Glide a metal spoon in between the flesh and the skin. Slip the tip of a large metal serving spoon into the flesh of the avocado as close the the skin as possible. Try to insert the spoon into the flesh before the dark green portion of the flesh to preserve as much of the flesh as possible. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e0\\/Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e0\\/Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nGently push the spoon underneath the flesh, following the curve of the skin as closely as possible. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/15\\/Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/15\\/Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nSlowly glide the spoon around the perimeter of the fruit to completely sever the flesh from the skin. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6e\\/Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6e\\/Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Peel-an-Avocado-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Lift the flesh out whole. Slide the spoon back under the bottom of the flesh and scoop it straight up and out. If the flesh has been completely loosened, it should come out in one solid chunk. If there are any parts of the flesh that are still stuck to the skin, the avocado may come out in pieces, instead. If you accidentally cut through the peel as you were severing the flesh, you may have small pieces of peel stuck to the flesh in several spots. Peel away any remaining fragments of skin. If there are any pieces of skin still stuck to the fruit, you can peel them off by digging your nail under the peel and lifting it away. If you are unable to remove the fragments with your nail, shave them off with a small paring knife, instead. From this point on, you can cut and prepare the avocado as desired. Peeling Avocado Slices Cut the avocado into quarters or slices. Cut each avocado half in half again, lengthwise, to produce quarters. If desired, you can continue cutting these sections lengthwise to create smaller, easier to handle sections. Place each half cut-side-down as you cut it into quarters or wedges. Doing so will give you more traction, making it easier and safer to cut the fruit. Smaller wedges will be easier to peel than wider wedges. Pinch the peel at the tip of the slice. Use your index finger and thumb to dig into the tip of each wedge, just below the dark green portion of the flesh and just above the skin. Ideally, you will only have the skin gripped in between your fingers. Note that this method is also referred to as the \u201cnick and peel\u201d method. Slowly peel the skin down and off. Peel the skin off the avocado as you would peel a banana. Hold the fruit in your non-dominant hand. Grip the exposed tip of the peel with your dominant hand and slowly pull it away from the flesh and downward. Peel slowly to prevent the flesh from breaking or the skin from tearing as you remove it. Alternatively, slice the skin off with a knife. If the avocado is not quite ripe, the skin may be difficult to remove with your fingers. If this happens, you can glide a small paring knife in between the peel and the flesh. This is not ideal, however, since you may lose more of the flesh this way than you would by simply peeling the skin off with your fingers. Peeling Avocado Chunks Score the avocado flesh. Use a paring knife to cut lines into the flesh. Cut a series of three or four parallel lines running from the top to the bottom of each half. Cut another set of lines perpendicular to this first set. Cut the flesh down to the skin, but do not cut into the skin. Use a spoon to separate the chunks from the flesh. Glide a large metal serving spoon beneath the flesh, severing the cubes from the skin at the point from which they are still attached. Gently push the spoon underneath the flesh, following the curve of the skin as closely as possible. Slowly glide the spoon around the perimeter of the fruit to completely sever the pieces of fruit from the skin. Peel away any remaining fragments of skin. If there are any little pieces of skin still stuck to the chunks of fruit, you can peel them off by digging your nail under the remaining peel and lifting it away. If you are unable to remove the fragments with your nail, you can try shaving them off with a small paring knife, instead.",
