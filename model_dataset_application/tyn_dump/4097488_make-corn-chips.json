          "description":"These chips are healthier if you bake them in an oven, but if you want corn chips with a store-bought taste and appearance, you'll need to deep-fry them in oil. When baking the chips, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). When frying the chips, pour 1/2 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a heavy skillet with high sides and heat it on medium high over the stove. Continue heating the oil until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)."

For thinner corn chips, you could increase the amount of water to 7/8 cup (210 ml). You could also boil the water in a microwave, but do so slowly and carefully to prevent the water from super-heating."

Add the cornmeal, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) corn or other vegetable oil, and salt to the water and mix together with clean hands or a wooden mixing spoon until well combined. If you want to add other seasonings, as well, you should do so at this time. For something mild, try 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper. For something with more of a kick, try 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chili powder, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder or onion powder, or 1 tsp (5 ml) of a steak or hamburger spice rub. Think about your favorite corn chip flavors. Experiment with different seasonings based on these flavors."
