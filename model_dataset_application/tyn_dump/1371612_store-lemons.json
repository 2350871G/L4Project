  "text":" Storing Whole Lemons Store lemons for immediate use. If you plan to use the lemons within a few days of purchase, store them away from direct sunlight. They typically stay fresh for about one week at room temperature. After this point, they start to wrinkle, lose their vibrant color, and develop soft or hard patches. Store extra lemons sealed in the refrigerator. Place the lemons in zip-locked bags, squeezing out as much air as you can.

Storing Cut Lemons Cover the cut side of the lemon. Reduce water loss and oxidization by protecting the cut side from air. Here are a few ways to do this:\nPlace lemon halves cut-side-down on a small plate. Wrap wedges or slices in plastic wrap. Place the cut lemons in the smallest airtight container you can find. Refrigerate. Although they last longer than most other cut fruit, lemons are still best within 2\u20133 days of cutting. Freeze slices to add to drinks.
