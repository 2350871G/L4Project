Cut two sole and two upper pieces. Do this by folding the fabric and laying out on a flat surface before cutting out the pattern. Pin the heel pattern to a single layer of fabric. Cut out 1 heel. You now have all the pattern pieces cut out for 1 shoe. Repeat to make the second shoe. Fold the heel piece in half width ways.  Insert a few pins along the folded edge to keep the heel in place.  Lay the elastic just along the fold line of the heel.  Mark the line with a pencil.  Sew a running stitch along the pencil line, removing the pins as you sew, to create the channel.  Clip the threads with the scissors.  Measure and cut off about 12 centimeters (about 5 inches) of elastic.  Use 1 safety pin to attach the elastic to 1 end of the channel.  Attach the second safety pin to the other end of the elastic.  Thread the elastic through the channel (casing).  Secure the elastic with the safety pin once the elastic has been inserted into the channel.  Secure one end of the elastic by sewing a running stitch with the sewing machine.  Measure the heel against the baby's foot to check the fit before securing the other end of the elastic.  Place one upper on a flat surface.  Pin the gathered heel piece edge-to-edge with the straight side of the upper.  Do this for both sides of the upper.  Sandwich the second upper on top and pin the layers in place.
