To protect yourself, take a moment to guard your nose and mouth with a respirator or safety mask. If you\u2019d prefer to take extra precautions, set up a fan within your workspace as well.

          "description":"Take a piece of coarse sandpaper and begin rubbing down the surface of your wooden project. As you go, try working the sandpaper along the grain of the wood, so your project can look as smooth and beautiful as possible. If you\u2019re working on a larger section of wood, like a hardwood floor, you might have an easier time using a drum sander or floor polisher with sanding disks. Always start with coarser pieces of sandpaper. These help get rid of any initial roughness, so you can start smoothing the surface with finer sandpaper later on. If you\u2019re using a drum sander or floor polisher, remove all furniture from the area so these items don\u2019t collect dust.Tip: You don't need to sand the wood if it's been oiled previously. This is only to remove an existing finish like wax, varnish, or paint."

          "description":"Continue going over the wooden surface, using sandpaper sheets or disks with finer grit levels. Work in long, consistent motions along the surface of the wood, keeping the sandpaper in line with the grain. As a final buffing layer, use 100-grit sandpaper to fully smooth over the surface of the wood. Feel the surface of the wood after each sanding. If the wood feels smooth and free of imperfections after an 80-grit sanding, you might not need to worry about the 100-grit paper or disk. If you\u2019re using a floor polisher, you might have a larger variety of sanding disks on hand."

    "Check on your wood surface once every 2-3 weeks.",
    "If your hardwood floor or piece of wooden furniture is used on a regular basis, you might see a rapid decline in glossiness and finish on the surface.",
    "Whenever this happens, apply 1-2 layers of boiled linseed oil to your wood, giving the item enough time to dry off in between coats.",
    "Always wipe off any excess linseed oil before applying an additional coat.",
    "Dump any oily rags into a metal can or plastic bag.",
    "As you finish using each oil-soaked cloth, toss the used rag into a separate metal can, plastic container, or bag.",
    "Once you\u2019ve set aside all your rags, fill up the rest of the can with cool water.",
    "Finally, seal off the container with a lid.",
    "Before throwing this can into the trash, call your garbage company and see what their policy is on disposing potentially hazardous material.",
    "When left unattended, rags soaked with boiled linseed oil can randomly catch on fire.",
    "If you keep any used material in a small, water-filled container, you shouldn\u2019t run into any issues."
