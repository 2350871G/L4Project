Clip off the tops of the bush, trimming it enough so that you can clearly see the bottom of the stems and which way they\u2019re growing. Pruning the plant lower will help promote new shoots. Cut the stems at approximately a 45\u00b0 angle to prevent you from having to go back and re-cut your branches later in the process."

If the plant is diseased, you might see a hole in the stem once it\u2019s cut, or a brown center. Keep cutting this off until you get to a healthy white core. Remove all of the old foliage as well. After you've removed the damaged part, cut about 1\u20132 centimetres (0.39\u20130.79 in) off of the stem at a time until you reach a white core."
