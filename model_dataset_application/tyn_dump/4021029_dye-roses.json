          "headline":"Cut the stem under water at an angle with shears or a sharp knife.",
          "description":"Hold the stem under water as you cut it down to 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 centimeters). Cutting the stem at an angle will prevent it from sitting flat against the bottom of the cup. Cutting it under water will prevent air bubbles from forming. Both of these will help the rose absorb the dye better. Take this time to trim off any thorns and leaves as well. Cut the stems shorter if you want the roses to soak up the dye faster. This will also help the roses turn out brighter."

          "description":"This will take at least 4 hours, so be patient! The longer you wait, the deeper the color will become. After 4 hours or so, the rose will take on a pastel color. If you want it to be a deeper color, you will have to wait 1 to 2 days. Keep in mind that the roses will be streaky and speckled. Rose petals will have small veins. They will look darker after you finish dyeing the rose. If this bothers you, leave the rose in the dye longer. For an interesting effect, dye the rose in one color for about 3 hours, then put it in a different color for 2 hours, then a third color for 1 hour."

If you are using shorter glasses, you can split the stems only 3 inches (7.6 centimeters). If your rose had a very thick stem to begin with, you can cut the stem into three or four sections instead.
