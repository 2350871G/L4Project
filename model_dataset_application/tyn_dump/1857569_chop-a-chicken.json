Tip: If the chicken is wet from thawing or sitting in the juices in the package, pat it down with a dry paper towel before you start cutting. This will make the skin less slippery and easier to cut. Pressing your thumb against the spot where the wing meets the body can make it easier to find the joint. If you pull up on the wing while you make the cut, the weight of the chicken will help make the separation easier. Ideally, you should use a sharp boning knife for this purpose.
