If your wall is smooth and sounds hollow when you knock on it, it\u2019s likely a form of drywall, such as sheetrock or plasterboard. For drilling a simple hole into this type of wall, a drywall bit is your best bet. You can purchase drywall bits and other types of drill bits at most hardware or home improvement stores. If you\u2019re planning to hang something (such as a picture) on a hollow section of drywall, you might choose to drive in a drywall anchor using a power screwdriver for greater security. If you\u2019ll be drilling into a stud behind the drywall, opt for a wood drill bit."
