          "description":"Start with a 5 to 6 pound roast. If it has bones, the roast will probably have about 3 bones extending out from it. Rub the entire roast with a quick brine mixture and set it in a roasting pan. Chill the roast for at least 8 hours so the brine has a chance to flavor the meat. For a brine, try mixing together:\n1 1/2 tablespoons of kosher salt\n3/4 teaspoon of dried herbs (like thyme, sage, and rosemary, or a blend)\n1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper"

Turn the oven on to 225 degrees F (107 C) while you wait for the meat. You should also move the rack to the lower third of the oven. This will ensure that you have space to set the roast."

          "description":"Put the roast in the preheated oven and cook it for 3 1/2 to 4 hours or until it has an internal temperature that you're going for. For example, if you want a medium-cooked roast, cook the roast until it reaches 130 degrees F (54 C). Remove the roast once it's as cooked as you'd like and let it rest for 30 minutes. Cover the roast with foil as it rests. This will help it retain heat and finish cooking. Use an instant read thermometer to get accurate temperature measurements."

          "description":"To get that great crispy crust on your roast, turn the oven temperature up to 500 degrees F (260 C) while the roast rests. Move the rack of the oven up as high as you can while still being able to fit the roast. Once the roast has rested and the oven is preheated, remove the foil and place the roast back in the oven. Roast the meat for 8 to 10 minutes. The roast should crisp up and turn dark brown as it sears."

Grill the steaks until they come about 10 degrees lower than the overall temperature you want. For example, if you want the steaks to be finished around 130 degrees F (55 C) for medium rare, cook the steaks over indirect heat until they're at 120 degrees F (49 C).
