If your corn is fresh and tender it may be ready to eat or you can further cook the corn by roasting it in the oven or by cooking the kernels with another method. To freeze the corn, place entire blanched ears in freezer-proof bags or containers. Blanching Corn on the Cob with Steam Prepare corn for blanching. Remove husk from corn completely.

Add roughly two to three inches (five to seven cm) of water to the pot. Use enough water that the surface  of the water is roughly an inch ( two  and a 1/2 cm) below the steamer basket or strainer. Place ears of corn in steamer basket in pot without overcrowding.  Cover pot and bring water to a boil.  Steam corn for approximately four minutes.  Plunge corn into ice water bath. Fill a large bowl or sink with cold water and ice to create ice water bath. Remove corn from pot using tongs or by carefully lifting steamer basket from pot. Submerge corn in ice water bath. Change water periodically if water temperature rises above 60\u02da F (15.6\u02da C). Use or freeze corn.  Blanching Whole Kernel Corn in Boiling Water Bring water to boil in a large pot. Use roughly one quart (one L) of water for each cup (250 mL) of kernels. Pour whole kernels carefully into boiling water.  Boil kernels of corn for approximately four minutes or until tender.  Drain water from the corn kernels by pouring the pot over a strainer placed in the sink.  Plunge corn into ice water bath to stop cooking process.  Use or freeze whole kernels of corn.  Blanching Whole Kernel Corn with Steam Prepare pot for steaming. Choose a pot large enough to blanch one to two cups (250 to 500 mL) of whole kernel corn at a time. Place a metal steamer basket or fine mesh strainer at the bottom of the pot. Add roughly two to three inches (five to seven cm) of water to the pot. Use enough water that the surface  of the water is roughly an inch ( two  and a 1/2 cm) below the steamer basket or strainer. Pour kernels of corn into steamer basket or strainer.  Cover pot and raise heat to bring water to a boil.  Steam kernels of corn for approximately four minutes or until tender.  Remove steamer basket or strainer with corn from the pot carefully.  Plunge corn into ice water bath to stop cooking process.  Use or freeze whole kernels of corn. ",
