  "text":" Baked Swordfish Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (176\u00b0C) and grease a 9x13 baking dish with olive oil.  Saut\u00e9 the garlic and the scallions in the butter in a medium sized skillet. Stir frequently until the garlic is golden brown. Add the lemon juice and wine.  Stir in the cr\u00e8me fraiche a little at a time, stirring well after each addition.  Bring all of the ingredients to a boil, stirring continuously.  Put the swordfish steaks into a greased baking dish. Allow space between the steaks; they should not overlap. Pour the wine and cream sauce over the swordfish steaks.  Bake, uncovered for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow the swordfish to stand for 5 minutes.  Transfer to serving dishes and garnish with fresh dill or parsley.  Broiled Swordfish Arrange your oven rack so that your broiler pan will be about 6\u201d (????) from the broiler heating unit. Turn your broiler setting to high.  Spray your broiler pan with vegetable oil.  Season each side of the swordfish steaks with salt and pepper.  Lay the swordfish on the broiler pan. Allow space between the steaks so that they cook evenly. Broil the fish for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven (or pull the rack out enough so that you will be able to turn the steaks.)  Carefully turn the fish over using a spatula.  Return the pan to the broiler and cook for another 5 minutes.  Serve immediately. Garnish with fresh parsley or dill and a lemon wedge. Swordfish Kebobs Cut the swordfish steaks into 1\u201d (2.54 cm) cubes.  Whisk together the mustard, garlic, olive oil, lime juice, soy sauce, pepper, dill and rosemary in a medium bowl.  Transfer the marinade to a shallow dish. The dish should be large enough to accommodate the swordfish cubes. Put the cubed swordfish in the marinade. Turn each cube over several times to be sure each one is thoroughly coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate the marinated cubes for 2 hours, turning once after 1 hour.  Start your grill. Once your fish kebabs have marinated for 2 hours, it will take you only a few minutes to put them on the skewers; your grill should be hot enough at that point to start grilling the kebobs. Remove the marinated swordfish from the refrigerator. Place the kebobs in a colander and drain the marinade into a bowl. Thread the swordfish cubes, tomatoes and pineapple chunks alternately onto each of 4 metal skewers.  Spray the grill rack with vegetable oil.  Place the skewers on the grill.  Grill for 5 to 8 minutes. Keep a close watch on your skewers so that the kebobs don\u2019t burn. Brush the leftover marinade onto the kebobs while they cook.  Put the kebobs on serving plates and serve them immediately. ",
