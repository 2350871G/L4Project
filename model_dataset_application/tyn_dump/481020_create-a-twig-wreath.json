Some trees work better than others and you should check for permission before trimming any foliage from property you don't own. Clip your twigs 8\u201310 inches (20.3\u201325.4 cm) in length.  Bend your hanger into a circle. The more even and smooth the circle is, the better your wreath will look. Wrap florist's wire around the hanger wire to fasten it.
