Here are a few delicious options:\nOlive oil, salt, black pepper (or lemon pepper), garlic powder, ground habanero pepper. Go easy on the salt and pepper, to avoid overpowering the tomato flavor. 1 cup (240 mL) olive oil, \u00bc cup (60 mL) white vinegar, \u00bc cup (60 mL) sugar, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) anchovy paste. Add parsley once cooled, and top the tomatoes with feta. To turn a marinade into a crust, mash breadcrumbs into it until soggy. Top the tomato with blue cheese and cover with the breadcrumb marinade mixture. Fresh basil, minced garlic, chopped fresh basil, and a pinch each of black pepper and salt."

Here are your options:\nCut medium to large tomatoes in half for easy handling with a spatula. If you're using the \"cheese crust\" mentioned above, cut the top \u00bc off medium or large tomatoes. Skewer small tomatoes whole on two parallel skewers, for easy turning. Place small tomatoes in a grill basket. Preheat the basket on the grill for a few minutes.

If you're in a hurry, just brush the marinade onto the cut side of the tomatoes, or onto the whole surface if the tomatoes are uncut. You'll still get some flavor, and the oil will help prevent sticking on the grate. For extra flavor, let the tomatoes soak in the marinade for a couple hours, or even overnight."
