Find the location where you want your fastener to go, and hold the hook up to the fabric on the underside (or inside) of the garment. If your garment has 2 seams which overlap, the hook should be on the overlay, and you\u2019ll put the eye on the underlay. However, a bar closure, rather than an eye, is often used for overlapping seams."

This will be the thread that you use to sew the hook into place. A basic sewing needle, called a sharp, is ideal for this project. They come in sizes 1-12, and the size you'll need will depend on the size of your hook. The needle needs to be small enough to fit through the loops and the hook and eye, but not so small that it bends when you pass it through the fabric. The thread won\u2019t be visible in your finished project, but the hook and eye will look nicer if you use thread that matches\u2014or at least coordinates with\u2014your fabric. If you\u2019re not sure what size needle you need, buy an assortment pack. These are typically very inexpensive and will allow you to experiment with different sizes."

Move the needle over just a little and do the same thing, and continue all around the loop, then repeat on the next loop. Place the stitches close together, since you want the loop to be completely (or at least mostly) covered by the thread. A blanket stitch is more secure and looks nicer than a regular stitch.

It will look best if you use the same color thread for the hook and the eye. Attach the eye to the hook and mark where the eye falls on the garment.

Pull the thread taut when you\u2019re finished. At no point should your needle come out through the top of your garment. This will leave visible stitches on the outside of the fabric.

Since you\u2019ll go back around the loop with the blanket stitches, these first stitches don\u2019t have to be as secure. Sew around both loops of the eye with blanket stitches. Pass the needle through the loop from the back to the front, leaving a big loop of thread. Then, push the needle through the loop and pull it tight. This will create a small knot. Move over just a little and make another loop, then pass the needle through again. Continue doing this all the way around both loops. Make sure the stitches are very close together.
