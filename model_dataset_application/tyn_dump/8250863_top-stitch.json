If possible, choose a sturdy fabric, such as denim, cotton, wool, canvas, or linen. If you are working with a lighter weight fabric, then you can use a stabilizer, such as tissue paper to help you get the best results. Lay your fabric over the tissue paper before you begin sewing, and then tear away the tissue paper after you finish sewing."

          "description":"Ironing your fabric before you top stitch will give you a flat, even surface to sew. It is especially important to iron along the seams of your fabric. Use long, even strokes to iron along the seams and anywhere else on the fabric that you will be top stitching. Use the lowest possible setting on your iron to help reduce the chances of damaging the fabric. You may also place a towel or t-shirt over the fabric before you iron it to protect the fabric from the heat."

You can use a universal needle meant for the density of fabric you are using, or select a specialty needle, such as a ball point needle for knits. Needle sizes range from 8 US (60 European) to 19 US (120 European). Opt for a larger number needle for heavy fabrics or a smaller number needle for light fabrics."

You can do this by choosing a thread that matches or contrasts with the fabric, and by making sure that the thread is slightly heavier than your fabric. For example, if you are going to be top stitching a pair of jeans, then you might opt for a heavy gold thread. Or, if you want to create a more subtle look, choose a dark blue thread."

Some presser foots feature guides that will make it easier to sew along the edges of fabric or to position a straight line in the center of your fabric. If you do not have or do not want to use a special presser foot, then you can also draw guidelines onto the fabric using chalk and a ruler to help you help you create straight lines. Drawing the outline of shapes onto your fabric can also help you to create decorative top stitching if desired. Use chalk to trace the edges of a shape or shapes, and then use these as guidelines when you sew the top stitching."

Try using the zig zag stitch, the curved stitch, or blanket stitch setting on your sewing machine for something extra visible. Using a decorative stitch will work best if you are going to be sewing in a straight line. If you try to sew along curved lines with a decorative stitch it may end up looking sloppy."

Move the dial (or use the digital touchpad) to reduce the tension setting by 1 point from the mid-range setting. This is 4 or 5 on most machines, so you would need to adjust your machine\u2019s tension setting down to 3 or 4. The tension dial is located at the top of your machine near where the thread feeds down towards the needle. The sewing machine tension on most machines ranges from 0 (loosest) to 9 (tightest)."

Press down evenly and gently on the pedal to ensure that you do not send your machine racing through the fabric and potentially ruining your fabric.

If you are concerned about keeping the stitches in place, try sewing 2 or 3 extra stitches in the same place at the end of the row without backstitching.
