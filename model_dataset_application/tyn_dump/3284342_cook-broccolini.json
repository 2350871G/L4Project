The same applies if the bases appear dried out, if the stems have soft spots, or if there are signs of flowering on the heads. Broccolini should be stored in a tightly sealed plastic bag or container inside the refrigerator until ready to use."

If the thin stalks are connected by a single thick stalk, this thick portion of the stalk holding the bundle together should be cut off. If any of the stalks you use are still a little too thick, you can trim them in half lengthwise for more manageable pieces."
