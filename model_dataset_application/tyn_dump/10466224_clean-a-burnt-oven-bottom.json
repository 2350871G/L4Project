Simply remove them, clean the oven racks, and replace them once you\u2019re done cleaning the oven. You can easily clean oven racks by soaking them in warm water with dish detergent mixed into it.

Excessive amounts of burned food layers can end up smoking a lot, setting off your smoke alarm and releasing chemicals. Keep an eye on your oven while running the self-cleaning cycle. If you start to see smoke, it\u2019s probably best to shut off the cycle and just clean everything by hand.

When you turn the oven back on, the heating elements can create fumes when burning off the cleaner, which could alter the taste of your food. For electric ovens, lift up the thick metal wire that forms the bake element and apply the cleaner underneath. If your oven is gas, try not to spray or get cleaner on the gas valve or igniter.
