  "text":" Preparing the Ingredients Wash the vegetables. Rinse the cucumbers and peppers under cool, running water. Dry well with clean paper towels. Peel the onion and garlic cloves. You can peel the cucumbers too, if desired, but doing so is not necessary and only a matter of personal preference. Remove the seeds from the cucumbers. Slice each cucumber in half lengthwise.

As with the cucumbers, chopping by hand will give you more control, but you can use a food processor if desired. Process each vegetable separately. Soaking the Vegetables Toss the vegetables with salt and water. Place the diced cucumbers, peppers, and onions in a large bowl. Toss the vegetables together with the salt, then cover the entire batch with cold water. Note that you should not add the minced garlic to this mixture. Set it aside until later. The bowl you use should be made of glass, plastic, or another non-reactive material. The water should be very cold to keep the vegetables as fresh as possible.

Pour the contents of the bowl through a fine mesh colander, discarding the soaking water. Thoroughly rinse the vegetables with cool, running water. Agitate the colander carefully while rinsing the vegetables to promote even coverage. Allow the rinse water to completely drain from the vegetables before continuing. Soak in fresh water.

You do not need to rinse the mixture this time, but you may need to gently press the vegetables against the sides and bottom of the colander to squeeze out as much excess moisture as possible. Cooking the Relish Combine the vinegar, sugar, and spices. Place the vinegar, sugar, minced garlic, dill seeds, mustard seeds, celery seeds, and turmeric in a 4-qt (4-L) saucepan. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat. You can use white vinegar, cider vinegar, or red wine vinegar; each will add a slightly different flavor profile and tint to the finished relish.

Allow the mixture to reach a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to medium and drop the liquid to a simmer. Allow the pickling mixture to simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

Continue cooking for about 10 minutes, or until most of the excess liquid evaporates. Stir the contents of the saucepan frequently to prevent them from burning and sticking to the saucepan. Store the Relish Prepare the jars. Sanitize the canning jars and lids in boiling water. Dry well with paper towels. If you have a dishwasher, you can clean the jars in the dishwasher instead of using boiling water. You'll still need to boil the lids, however. To reduce the amount of wait time, it's best to perform this step while simultaneously soaking or cooking the relish. Prepare a water bath. Fill a water canner halfway with water. Cover it with its lid, and start heating it over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil. It's best to prepare this water bath while the relish cooks. If you don't have a water canner, you can use a large stockpot with a heat-proof rack placed in the bottom. Note that a water bath is only necessary if you plan on processing the cans of relish for long-term storage. If you intend to use the relish within one month, you can skip this part. Pack the relish into the jars. Ladle the finished relish into the sanitized jars, leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of empty headspace in each jar. Briefly and gently stir the sides of each jar to release as many air bubbles as possible. Use a damp cloth to wipe excess liquid from the jar rims, then tightly screw the lids on top of the jars. Process the jars for 10 minutes. Carefully lower the cans of relish into the boiling water. Allow the water to reach a boil again, then cover the canner and process the relish for 10 minutes.
