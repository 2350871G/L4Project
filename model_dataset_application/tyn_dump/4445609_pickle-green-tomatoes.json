  "text":" Preparing Tomatoes Measure the amount of green tomatoes you want to pickle. You will need between one and one and a half lb. (0.5 to 0.7kg) of tomatoes per quart jar. Multiply the vinegar, water and salt needed by the number of batches you are going to do. Wash your tomatoes thoroughly.  Slice cherry tomatoes in half from top to bottom. Quarter larger tomatoes. Making the Brine Place the saucepan on the stove. Add your water, vinegar and pickling spice. Heat the brine to a gentle boil over medium heat. Remove it from the heat source when it has boiled. Decide upon the type of spices you want to use for your pickles. You will pour the dry spices into the bottoms of each jar.
