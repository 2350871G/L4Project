As the water passes through the filter, the calcite raises the pH levels of your water. Call a plumber to attach the filter to your water line. Neutralizing filters work well for raising the pH of well water. Installing a filter can affect the hardness of your water so you may want to install a water softener. Filters in the United States cost around $500 USD. The calcite or magnesium oxide needs to be replaced every 2-3 years to continue working."
