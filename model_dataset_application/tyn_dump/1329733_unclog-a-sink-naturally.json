          "description":"The plunger can unclog your sink just as easily as it can unclog your toilet. Be sure to clean the plunger before using it on the sink, though, or purchase a new plunger for use in the sink. Cover the drain opening completely with the plunger. If you have a double sink, plug the drain you aren't plunging so you get full suction. Pump the plunger up and down several times to loosen the clog. Remove the plunger after a minute or so of work to see if water will flow down the sink. If the sink is still clogged, continue to plunge to further loosen the blockage."

          "description":"Bend a wire coat hanger into a straight line, with the curved hook at one end. Slide the wire hook-first down your clogged drain and see if you can hook and remove or otherwise break apart any portions of the blockage. Push the hanger down until you feel some resistance. Then, wiggle the hanger up and down and side to side to try to get it to latch onto the block. Once you believe you have hooked the block, pull the hanger up to clear out whatever you have caught. If you do not feel resistance as you push the hanger down, chances are your clog is lower and you need a specialty tool."

          "headline":"Snake your drain.",
          "description":"A drain snake is a long metal cable with a coil or auger on the end that helps manually remove blockages from drains. Purchase a drain snake appropriately sized for your sink at your local hardware or home improvement store to help you clear stubborn blocks. Feed the snake into the drain and push down until you feel some resistance from the clog. Be careful if you have older metal pipes because you could puncture the trap. Once you've hit the clog, turn the cable clockwise for three to four full rotations, then pull up somewhat. If you feel some resistance, you have likely hooked on the clogged matter. Continue to rotate the drain snake until you have pushed through the entirety of the clog and started to break it into smaller pieces. When you feel resistance start to lessen, pull the snake out slowly and remove what's left of the clog from the end of the auger. Check to make sure your drain is unclogged. If water still doesn't flow down it properly, repeat the snake process. Once the drain is flowing, run hot water down the pipes for 5 minutes to clean them."

Try to avoid using it on metallic pipes, though, as the baking soda may corrode the pipe surface and leach metals from your water into your pipes. Remove your drain cover and pour half a cup of baking soda directly down your drain. You may want to use a funnel to help get the product down. Follow the baking soda with half a cup of distilled white vinegar. Allow the mixture to bubble and fizz in the drain for up to 15 minutes. Once the bubbling has stopped, wash your drain out with your tap water on its hottest setting."

Pour this down the drain and allow to sit for 20 to 30 minutes before rinsing out using tap water on its warmest setting. Be cautious when using hydrogen peroxide, as concentrated versions of it can cause chemical burns to the skin if not monitored properly. Do not use hydrogen peroxide if you previously tried a baking soda cleaner."

Let the plumber know what methods you have already tried to unclog your sink so that they can avoid using products that may cause a negative chemical reaction. Check local listing online or in the phonebook to see if there is a plumber near you that is environmentally-conscious."

Scrape food off into the trash can before rinsing, and use the disposal only for those small pieces that could not make it to the trash. Never pour grease or oils into the drain.

Periodically fill up sinks and bathtubs with hot water and drain them to keep your pipes clean. Do not heat tap water by boiling or microwaving it, as water that is too hot has the potential to harm your pipes."
