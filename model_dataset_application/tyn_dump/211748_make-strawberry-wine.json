    "The exact level is not crucial, however, and mostly comes down to taste.",
    "As long as you use less than a teaspoon total your wine will be fine.",
    "Use 1/16lb of Sodium Bisulfate for each 8lbs of strawberries.",
    "For large batches, dispense with the Campden tablets and use Sodium Bisulfate instead.",
    "This sterilizes the wine as you make it, eliminating competing yeasts and bacteria from your mix so the wine yeast can do its job.",
    "Add an extra teaspoon of yeast nutrient for each 4lbs of berries, up to 5 teaspoons total.",
    "If you're making over 25lbs of wine, you'll need to adapt this entire recipe for mass production.",
    "Anything less than that should be fine with 1 teaspoon per 4lbs or so, sticking to one full packet of wine yeast the entire time.",
    "Consider trying out a \"wild yeast\" version by ignoring all sterilizers entirely.",
    "This uses naturally occurring yeasts in the air and fruit for fermentation.",
    "If you do, know you must extend your first fermentation from 1-2 days to one full week.",
    "Add other fruits for new flavors without having to adjust the recipe.",
    "As long as your strawberries are the key fruit, you shouldn't have to adjust the recipe much, other than adding a little more or less sugar depending on your preferences.",
    "All of these fruits are added with the strawberries.",
    "While any fruit can be used to make wine, some popular additions with strawberries include:\nSubstitute 1lb of blueberries, apples, cherries, or pears\nAdd 1-2tb of fresh lemon or orange peel.",
