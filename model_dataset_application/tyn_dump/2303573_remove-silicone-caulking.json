A hair dryer can generate enough heat to soften old, stiff silicone caulk without the risk of damage to surrounding surfaces.

          "description":"Turn on your hair dryer and place the nozzle directly up against the bead of old caulk you want to remove. Wave the heat stream back and forth slowly over an 8\u201310 in (20\u201325 cm) section to begin warming it up. Within about half a minute, the heat from the hair dryer will have partially melted the caulk, causing it to become gummy and flexible. If the hair dryer doesn't seem to be having much effect after about 40 seconds, try turning it up to the next highest heat setting.Warning: Prolonged exposure to heat could cause permanent damage to plastic and similar materials, so be careful not to heat any single area for too long."

Once you've separated the softened caulk, pry up 1 end with the corner of your blade. A utility knife will be your best option, as the long handle and slender blade offers greater precision and control. For safety reasons, it's not recommended that you use a loose razor blade to do your scoring. If you have no other option, however, be sure to wear thick gloves to protect your hands and work cautiously."

Avoid tugging or twisting the caulk as it comes up. This will make it more likely to break into smaller sections, which you'll then have to remove individually. If you don't have a pair of pliers on hand, you can try stripping the bead using your thumb and index finger\u2014just don't forget to slip on a pair of gloves first!"

When this happens, simply wedge the end of your scraper under the caulk at a shallow angle and push it along using short strokes. It should then come away without difficulty. If you don't have one of these other tools handy, pick up a cheap grout remover tool from your local home improvement center. These are typically made of hard plastic and don't cost more than a few dollars."

Any type of applicator will get the job done. However, you'll get the best results using an abrasive item, as the rough texture will help wear down tough residue. Mineral spirits can cause mild irritation if it comes into contact with bare skin. Be sure to pull on a pair of disposable gloves before you begin working. If the residue left behind shows signs of mold, consider using bleach instead of mineral spirits."

As it does, it will slowly eat away at the remaining bits of caulk, which you'll then be able to wipe away with ease. Both mineral spirits and bleach give off powerful fumes that can be harmful if inhaled. Be sure to open all doors and windows in your work area and leave the air conditioning or fan running while soaking your caulk to create as much ventilation as possible.Tip: If you're still having trouble breaking up stuck-on residue, try covering the residue with rags soaked in rubbing alcohol and leaving them overnight."

Allow the exposed joint to air-dry overnight, or use your hair dryer to speed up the drying process. Afterward, it will be ready for a fresh bead of sealant. It's important to make sure that the area is completely free of caulk or mold. If there's any residue left over, the fresh sealant may not be able to adhere properly."
