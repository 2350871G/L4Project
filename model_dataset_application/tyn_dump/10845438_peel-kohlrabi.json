To do this, place the vegetable on a large cutting board, hold it in one hand, and use your other hand to cut it in half with a chef's knife. Keep in mind that the outer skin of the kohlrabi is very tough. Make sure to hold the kohlrabi firmly in your hand so it doesn't slip while you're cutting it."

Use the sharp tip of your chef\u2019s knife to cut out the inner core from each quarter of the kohlrabi. If you have a smaller kohlrabi, you can leave the core in the vegetable.
