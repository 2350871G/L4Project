Set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Make sure that you know how your oven alerts you that it\u2019s preheated.

          "description":"Tear 3 slices of whole wheat bread into several smaller pieces, so you can toss them into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the food processor until the bread becomes fine crumbs, which should take 25 to 30 seconds. You may find it easier to make the breadcrumbs if the bread is slightly dried out before putting it in the food processor. Leave it out on the counter, uncovered, for several hours or overnight. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can turn your bread into crumbs in a blender. Just make sure to add the bread in small batches or it may become gummy. You can also use a knife to create breadcrumbs. Cut your bread slices into strips, and then gather the strips together to cut them into smaller crumb-like pieces."

Place the sheet in the preheated oven, and allow the crumbs to bake until they are golden brown, which should take approximately 10 to 12 minutes. This recipe will make approximately 1 cup of breadcrumbs. You\u2019ll only need about half for the chicken, so store the remainder in an airtight container. They\u2019ll keep in your pantry for a couple of weeks and in your refrigerator for about a month. If you plan to prepare your chicken Parmesan right after you make the breadcrumbs, don\u2019t turn the oven off when you remove the baking sheet from the oven."

Make sure to thoroughly wash your hands, cutting board, knife, and any other items that come into contact with the raw chicken to avoid spreading bacteria throughout your kitchen.

Once the chicken is covered with the butter and oil mixture, press the cutlets into the breadcrumb mixture. Make sure to coat both sides of the chicken, and shake off the excess. Place the chicken on the baking sheet and mist with oil. When the chicken is coated with the breadcrumb mixture, set the cutlets on the greased baking sheet.
