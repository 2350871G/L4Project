Place a lid on the container or cover it in plastic wrap, and leave it to sit for 24 hours. Cooking smoked gammon usually requires a little bit of planning ahead. If you know you\u2019re making this meal for a special occasion, set a reminder on your phone for the day before so you don\u2019t forget to soak it in time. Some sources say you can soak the gammon for as little as 12 hours, so use your own judgement. The soaking process is mainly used to remove excess salt."

If you don\u2019t have a meat thermometer, follow this formula: simmer the gammon for 30 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of meat. Glazing and Roasting Remove the gammon from the stockpot using your tongs. Place the gammon on a clean surface or back onto the cutting board you used to chop up your vegetables. Alternately, if you don\u2019t want to save the water and vegetables to make your own stock, you could place a colander in the sink and drain off the water that way. Use caution when removing the gammon or draining the water! Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). It\u2019s okay to let your gammon rest on the counter while the oven preheats and you finish preparing the rest of the meal. Use a sharp knife to score the top of the gammon. Using caution because the gammon is still very hot, make shallow, diagonal cuts across the top of the gammon. Then make diagonal cuts going the opposite direction to make a diamond pattern. Scoring the gammon helps the glaze to penetrate the skin better. Chop up the rest of your vegetables and line a baking dish with them. Use a sharp kitchen knife and a cutting board to dice up the remaining 2 onions, 3 carrots, and 3 celery stalks. Additionally, cut the head of garlic in half. Take out a large, clean, oven-safe baking dish and line the bottom of it with the chopped vegetables. Place the garlic so that the cut side is facing up in the dish. There is no need to oil or butter the bottom of the dish. Whisk together the rest of the ingredients to make your glaze. Use 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of wholegrain mustard, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of honey, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of cooking oil. Combine these in a small bowl and whisk them together until they are fully incorporated. You can make a lot of different glazes for your gammon depending on your preferences. Try making a honey mustard glaze by combining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of honey, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of mustard powder, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of tomato puree, and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of balsamic vinegar. Place the gammon on the vegetables and spoon on half of the glaze. Depending on how hot the gammon is at this point, either transfer it by hand or use your tongs to put it on top of the vegetables in your baking dish. Then, use a large spoon to distribute about half of the glaze over the top. It\u2019s okay if the glaze drips down to the bottom of the dish. Just try to get as much of it on top of the gammon and in the scoring as possible. Bake the gammon for 1 1/2-2 hours, reglazing it every 15-20 minutes.
