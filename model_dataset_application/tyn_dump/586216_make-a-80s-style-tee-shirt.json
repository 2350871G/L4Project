You will be cutting this shirt up, so make sure it's one you don't mind permanently altering. A blank shirt would work best, but you can use a decorated one too."

This will give you an off-the-shoulder look. You can cut through both layers of fabric at the same time for something quick and easy. For a more professional finish, cut the front neckline lower than the back."

You will have to trim around the image, or the white will show up.Baggy t-shirts were very popular in the 80s.

Make sure that you get the right generation, however; many of the original cartoons got reboots. For example, the new My Little Ponies look very different from the original ones. This will defeat the whole vintage look. Some of the most popular ones were: Thundercats, Mighty Mouse, and Rainbow Brite. Care Bears, My Little Pony, and Popples were also popular.
