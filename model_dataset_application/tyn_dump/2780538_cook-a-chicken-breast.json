    "EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Hong\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Hong is the Executive Chef and Co-Owner of Sorrel, a New American restaurant in San Francisco.",
    "He has been working in restaurants for over ten years.",
    "Alex is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, and has worked in the kitchens of Jean-Georges and Quince, both Michelin-starred restaurants.",
    "Alex Hong\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\tUse the same technique to grill a whole chicken.",
    "Alex Hong, the Executive Chef at Sorrel, says: \"I love roasting a whole bird, but I'm also a big fan of grilling.",
    "I like to take the meat off the cage and throw it on the grill to get all the smoky flavors.\"",
    "Prepare your marinade.",
    "Add the olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, and lemon zest into a large bowl.",
    "Briskly stir it together using a whisk or fork.",
    "If you can't find any dried thyme or oregano, you can use fresh instead.",
    "Plan on using three times as much of the fresh herb.",
    "You can use your own marinade, or even some dressing instead.",
    "If you plan using some of the marinade during or after grilling, set some aside now.",
    "Once the raw chicken touches the marinade, you cannot reuse it.",
    "Marinate the chicken for at least 1 to 2 hours.",
    "Place the chicken into the bowl you mixed the marinade in.",
    "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave it in the fridge for at least 1 to 2 hours.",
    "It would be better if you let it marinate for 4 to 12 hours, however.",
    "Clean and grease your grill, and preheat it to high.",
    "Scrape the grate clean.",
    "Dip a folded paper towel into vegetable oil, then wipe the grate with it.",
    "The grate needs to be glossy with oil.",
    "Turn the heat up to high.",
    "Consider having a two-zone fire, with the heat focused on one side.",
    "That way, if the chicken cooks too quickly, you can move it to the other side of the grill to finish cooking over a lower temperature.",
    "Place the chicken breasts onto the grill once it is done heating.",
    "If you are using a two-zone fire, place the chicken on the hotter part of the grill.",
    "This way, you can move it to the cooler part if it is cooking too fast.",
    "The chicken pieces can be close together, but they should not be touching.",
    "Cook the chicken for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, turning once.",
    "Cook the chicken until the underside turns brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "Use a pair of tongs to flip the chicken over, then cook it for another 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "The chicken is ready when the center is no longer pink and the juices are clear.",
    "If you are cooking bone-in chicken, give it another minute or two on each side.",
    "Unlike beef, chicken must be completely cooked through.",
    "If you want to be extra safe, stick a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken.",
    "The temperature should read around 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).",
    "Let the chicken rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving it.",
    "This allows the juices to settle back into the meat.",
    "Keep the chicken covered with aluminum foil while it is resting so that it doesn't get cold or dry out.",
    "Saut\u00e9ing Chicken Breasts Place the chicken breasts into a plastic, zippered bag, then pound them flat with meat mallet.",
    "The chicken breasts need to be about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) thick.",
    "Focus on the thicker parts of the chicken breast first; you want the breasts to be the same thickness all around.",
    "This will help them cook faster and more evenly.",
    "No meat mallet?",
    "No problem!",
    "Use a rolling pin or heavy jar instead.",
    "Can't find any plastic, zippered bags that are big enough?",
    "Use two sheets of plastic wrap instead.",
    "Don't wash the chicken breasts before hand.",
    "You can cut away any excess fat if you'd like, however.",
    "This method is not recommended for bone-in chicken.",
    "Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.",
    "You can also use your own spices, seasonings, and rubs.",
    "Heat a skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke a little.",
    "If you aren't using a nonstick skillet, lightly coat the skillet with about 2 to 3 teaspoons of cooking oil.",
    "Tilt the pan from side-to-side to help the oil spread across the entire surface.",
    "If you are using a nonstick skillet, then you don't need to coat it.",
    "Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the skillet.",
    "The skillet needs to be big enough to big enough to fit all of the chicken breasts in one layer with some space in between each breast.",
    "If the skillet is too small, the chicken will steam instead.",
    "Lower the heat to medium, then cook the chicken for 8 to 12 minutes, turning it occasionally using a spatula.",
    "It is ready when the inside is no longer pink, and the juices are clear.",
    "The temperature should read 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).",
    "Stick a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken.",
    "It needs to read 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).",
    "If the chicken is browning too quickly, lower the heat to medium-low.",
    "Serve the chicken, or use it in your recipe.",
    "Saut\u00e9ed chicken is tasty on its own, especially if served alongside some rice.",
    "You can also slice it up, and serve it on top of a salad, or use it in a sandwich.",
    "Poaching Chicken Breasts Arrange the chicken breasts in the bottom of a large saucepan.",
    "It's okay if the chicken breasts overlap, but they will cook more evenly if they don't.",
    "Skinless, boneless chicken is the best for this method, but you can use bone-in chicken as well.",
    "Do not wash the chicken breasts beforehand, as this will only spread bacteria.",
    "Any bacteria will be killed during the cooking process.",
    "Sprinkle some salt and pepper on top of the chicken, then add the lemon slices, fresh thyme, and rosemary.",
    "At this point, you can also add in some soy sauce for extra flavor.",
    "Cover the chicken with water.",
    "The water should be 1 to 1\u00bd inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) above the chicken.",
    "How much water you use will depend on the size of your saucepan.",
    "Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then let it simmer, covered, over low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "The thicker the chicken breasts are, the longer they will cook.",
    "They are ready when the meat is no longer pink inside.",
    "If you are using bone-in chicken, it will need to cook for about 20 minutes.",
    "Take the chicken out of the saucepan and serve it.",
    "Use a pair of tongs so you don't burn yourself.",
    "You can serve the chicken as is, or you cut or shred the meat, and use it in your recipe.",
    "You can also discard the water, or strain it, and use it as a base for soups or sauces."
