A good rule of thumb is to add six inches onto your initial width measurement."

You'll want to buy a board that is as long as the measurement of your door, but you'll also need two cuts on the ends about three inches long. Cornice material is often a soft wood such as pine or poplar, but it can be made from other material such as foam. Get wood for any decorations you choose, such as a top shelf or crown molding."

You can also buy a thin piece of board where you'll rest the cornice before securing it from the top with more screws. All of these options can be found at local hardware stores. No option is preferable or sturdier to the other, so this depends on how you wish to screw into the drywall of your house. Bracket mounting can become complicated, as this includes finding L-shaped brackets and screwing these into both the wall and the cornice. Board and screw mounting is simple and good for cornices with tops, but getting the screws close enough to the walls can prove to be a tight fit."

Any fabric can be used, but engineered fabrics are more durable than natural fabrics. Some cottons are durable, but if you have pets and kids, it may be worth avoiding silk and rayon, for example. Fabric isn't a mandatory choice. You can also paint the cornice or stain it."
