If all of the flowers have opened already, then it will be difficult to evaluate the health of the plant. Inspect the petals for fungal spots and pests, which would indicate that the plant is not healthy. The grower\u2019s shop is also a good indication of a plant\u2019s health. Consider the cleanliness of the shop, the attentiveness of the shop employees, and whether or not the grower is knowledgeable enough to answer your questions."

Transferring an orchid at any other time of the year may cause undue stress to the plant and this may kill it. Orchids become dormant in the winter and will begin to grow again in the spring. Try to time your transfer for early in the spring before the orchid starts growing and flowering."

Make sure to wait until after the orchid has bloomed to repot it though. Don\u2019t wait too long to repot your orchids! The roots should not grow more than 0.5 in (1.3 cm) before you repot it."

Instead, choose a special orchid posting mix, bark chips, tree fern, or stones as the growing medium. This will help to ensure that your orchid will have a solid foundation for its roots, but will not get soggy from frequent watering. Check your local nursery or garden center for a special potting mix for orchids. If you are not sure what to buy, ask an employee for a recommendation."
