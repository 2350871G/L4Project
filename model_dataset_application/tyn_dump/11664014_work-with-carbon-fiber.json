          "description":"Take the existing part and set it on a piece of backer board. Use a clean cloth to spread a thin, even coating of a wax release agent over the top of the part. When it dries after 20 minutes, brush on a polyester gelcoat. Then, mix the putty with enough of the release agent to turn it a consistent shade of blue. After flattening it and waiting 24 hours for it to harden, spread it over the top of the part to finish the mold. The gelcoat has to be mixed with a separate hardener in order for it to work. The hardener will be included with the gelcoat when you buy it. Stir in about 12 drops of hardener per 1 fluid ounce (30 mL). Use modeling clay to seal any gaps in the mold before adding the release agent. You can shape the clay to create the mold\u2019s edges, which will hold in the molding putty and epoxy. Use a utility knife to flatten the clay. After the mold hardens, remove the old part. Try pulling it out with pliers or tapping it loose with a rubber mallet. All of the supplies needed for the mold can be found online or purchased from most hardware stores. You can also purchase pre-made molds if you don't want to make your own."

Ventilate your workspace as well to eliminate dust and fumes. Open nearby doors and windows to help ventilate the area. Turn on any ventilation fans you have available. Keep other people and pets out of the area until you\u2019re done working."

If you\u2019re using a foam and fiberglass mold, for example, spread the PVA over the fiberglass. Make sure the mold is covered with a thin but even coat, including the sides and corners. There are other types of release agents you can use, including spray-on products or silicone. Paste wax is also commonly used. To get all the supplies you need, buy a carbon fiber kit online. Otherwise, buy the components separately online, at general stores, and at hardware stores."

Use a wood mixing stick to stir them together. While you\u2019re stirring, scrape the epoxy off the sides of the cup several times to ensure it all mixes together thoroughly. The ratio of resin and hardener is typically 1 to 1, but it could vary depending on the product you use. Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for more information."

Remember to paint over any side walls, corners, and other tight spots that are easy to miss. Keep applying epoxy until the mold is covered with a thin but consistent coating. Without this initial layer, the finished carbon fiber won\u2019t be completely covered in hardened epoxy. Make sure the entire mold is well-covered in it before moving on. Some areas can be difficult to reach with a brush. If you\u2019re having trouble, use a gloved finger or a mixing stick to spread some of the epoxy around."

For most molded parts, do this at least 2 times. You will end up with 3 carbon fiber sheets bound together by epoxy. If you\u2019re wrapping something to cover it with carbon fiber, you only have to use a single sheet of carbon fiber. Remember to coat the final sheet with epoxy as well.

Remove any cut fibers or excess sheeting so it doesn\u2019t get stuck in the mold.

When you come back the next day, the epoxy will have dried out. Once it has hardened, it is safe to touch with your bare fingers. The mold can sometimes take up to 24 hours to dry. If it seems a little soft, let it dry for longer before attempting to remove the carbon fiber. Another way to cure the epoxy is by sticking the mold into a curing oven for several hours. Set the oven so it\u2019s between 250 and 350 \u00b0F (121 and 177 \u00b0C). Avoid using a regular cooking oven, since it will give off toxic fumes."

You could then switch to a higher-grit sandpaper like 600 or 1,000 for a smoother finish, but it isn\u2019t necessary. If your carbon sheeting is at the wrong size, use a Dremel tool to easily cut away the excess. Finish it with a piece of 400-grit sandpaper afterward to smooth over the edges."

Spread the epoxy onto the carbon fiber afterward. Try using a paint brush to spread it into a thin but consistent coating. Let the new epoxy layer dry overnight before using the new part. Acrylic paint or ink can also be used but will dull the epoxy. Most people prefer the shiny finish left by the epoxy, making dye powder a better choice. You could color epoxy with alcohol ink. However, the ink is flammable and toxic, which can make it a problem in some cases."

    "For most molded parts, do this at least 2 times.",
    "You will end up with 3 carbon fiber sheets bound together by epoxy.",
    "If you\u2019re wrapping something to cover it with carbon fiber, you only have to use a single sheet of carbon fiber.",
    "Remember to coat the final sheet with epoxy as well.",
    "Even though you won\u2019t be sticking another sheet there, the epoxy forms a protective layer.",
    "Trim off the excess sheeting with sharp scissors.",
    "Go around the entire mold with suitable scissors or another cutting tool.",
    "Remove any carbon fiber sheeting overhanging the mold.",
    "Cut gradually while keeping a firm grip on the mold to prevent the carbon fiber from coming loose.",
    "Make sure the remaining sheeting is the exact shape you want the finished product to be.",
    "Remove any cut fibers or excess sheeting so it doesn\u2019t get stuck in the mold.",
    "Try to keep the remaining sheeting neat with smooth, consistent cuts so the finished product looks as good as it can.",
    "Leave the mold overnight for the epoxy to solidify.",
    "Keep it on a flat, stable surface so both the epoxy and carbon fiber sheeting stay in place.",
    "Make sure the room has good air circulation.",
    "When you come back the next day, the epoxy will have dried out.",
    "Once it has hardened, it is safe to touch with your bare fingers.",
    "The mold can sometimes take up to 24 hours to dry.",
    "If it seems a little soft, let it dry for longer before attempting to remove the carbon fiber.",
    "Another way to cure the epoxy is by sticking the mold into a curing oven for several hours.",
    "Set the oven so it\u2019s between 250 and 350 \u00b0F (121 and 177 \u00b0C).",
    "Avoid using a regular cooking oven, since it will give off toxic fumes.",
    "Finishing Molded Carbon Fiber Pull the carbon sheeting out of the mold by hand.",
    "Solidified carbon fiber takes a little force to remove, but it can usually be done without special tools.",
    "Slip your finger under one side of the sheeting and attempt to lift it up.",
    "If it\u2019s stuck, lift up the other sides as well until the sheeting pops out of the mold.",
    "If you\u2019re having a hard time removing the carbon sheeting, pry it up with a tool.",
    "Plastic wedges work very well and don\u2019t leave scratches.",
    "You could also tap the mold with a rubber mallet to loosen the sheeting, but be gentle to avoid breaking it.",
    "A rubber mallet is also handy for pounding plastic wedges down under the sheeting.",
    "Sand the carbon sheeting to its final size with 400-grit sandpaper.",
    "The carbon sheeting will likely still be a little rough from where you cut it earlier.",
    "While wearing a good dusk mask, scrub around the edges.",
    "Wear away any excess material first, then give the edges a final sanding to smooth them out.",
    "You could then switch to a higher-grit sandpaper like 600 or 1,000 for a smoother finish, but it isn\u2019t necessary.",
    "If your carbon sheeting is at the wrong size, use a Dremel tool to easily cut away the excess.",
    "Finish it with a piece of 400-grit sandpaper afterward to smooth over the edges.",
    "Use an epoxy resin dye if you wish to color the carbon fiber.",
    "Epoxy resin comes in a powder form.",
    "To use it, mix a fresh batch of epoxy resin first.",
    "Then, sprinkle the power in and stir the epoxy into a consistent color.",
    "Spread the epoxy onto the carbon fiber afterward.",
    "Try using a paint brush to spread it into a thin but consistent coating.",
    "Let the new epoxy layer dry overnight before using the new part.",
    "Acrylic paint or ink can also be used but will dull the epoxy.",
    "Most people prefer the shiny finish left by the epoxy, making dye powder a better choice.",
    "You could color epoxy with alcohol ink.",
    "However, the ink is flammable and toxic, which can make it a problem in some cases."
