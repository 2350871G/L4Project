      "description":"The iris borer is a small caterpillar that eats its way into the leaves of the iris and then bores down to the rhizomes. The borers introduce bacteria to the rhizomes, which causes them to grow soft, turn brown, and eventually die. Use the pruning shears to cut off any rhizomes that show damage if there are several in a clump that are not infected and you wish to save them. Discard any leaves or rhizomes that have holes or are soft and mushy to the touch. Cleaning up dead iris leaves in the fall will help to eliminate iris borer eggs and reduce the number hatching in the spring. Apply dimethoate in the spring as a systemic insecticide if you have a severe iris borer problem."
