          "description":"Grab a large baking tray for your cashews, but do not add any grease to the tray. If you\u2019re concerned about the nuts sticking, however, you can line the tray with parchment paper. If roasting a small amount of cashews, consider using a cake pan instead, which you can shake frequently during cooking to toss the oils. Cashews can be oil roasted or dry roasted. If you dry roast the cashews and wish to add salt without adding any oil, try coating or spraying your cashews with brine or salt-water solution, then letting them dry, before roasting them. This helps the salt adhere to the nuts."

          "description":"Roasting cashews with a little oil is recommended, but not strictly necessary. Drizzle between 1 and 2 tsp (5 and 10 mL) of oil over the cashews. Stir and toss the cashews gently on the baking tray to coat evenly with oil. Roasting the nuts in oil will enhance the flavor and texture, but it will increase the overall oiliness of the finished product. If you're using them for baking purposes (e.g., adding them to cookies or brownies), omit the oil and skip this step. If you're eating them on their own or using them as a garnish, however, roast the cashews in oil. Less is more in this step. You can add more oil later, as needed, after your cashews have started roasting. You can use a nut oil, like almond oil or walnut oil, or opt for another healthy oil, like grapeseed oil, olive oil, or coconut oil."

Cashews should only need between 8 and 15 minutes of total roasting time before being ready. When ready, the nuts should release a strong yet pleasing odor and look several shades darker. You may even hear some crackling if you cooked them in oil. Cashews can burn quickly, so it's important that you check and stir frequently to minimize this risk."

If adding the roasted cashews to baked goods, you may wish to skip the oil and salt. You could also use other seasonings as desired during this step. Examples of seasonings that complement the flavor of cashews include cinnamon, sugar, paprika, cayenne, cloves, and nutmeg. If you soaked the nuts in brine or salt water before roasting them, do not add any additional seasoning here. The initial salt in the solution should be enough."

    "Once the cashews are roasted to your desired level of doneness, remove them from the oven.",
    "Toss them in the rosemary-butter mixture until all nuts are evenly coated.",
    "Cool before serving.",
    "Allow the nuts to cool slightly, for 10 to 15 minutes, tossing occasionally to redistribute the seasoned butter.",
    "Serve them immediately once cooled or store them in an airtight container, at room temperature, for up to two weeks.",
    "Note that if you only heated the cashews for five minutes instead of the full 12 to 15, you can serve them immediately while warm instead of waiting for them to cool.",
    "Sweet and Spicy Roasted Cashews Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (162 degrees Celsius).",
    "Line a large baking tray with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper.",
    "Combine the honey and cayenne pepper.",
    "Combine the two ingredients in a large bowl, stirring thoroughly to blend them into a cohesive glaze.",
    "If the honey is too thick, you may wish to microwave the mixture for five seconds or so to help liquify it.",
    "Doing so should make it easier to combine the two ingredients.",
    "If you'd like to add more dimension to this recipe, you could try adding both honey and maple syrup; stick with a total of 1/4 cup (60 ml), but vary the proportions according to your own sense of taste.",
    "Stir in the cashews.",
    "Pour the cashews into the mixing bowl.",
    "Stir and toss the cashews in the honey and cayenne mixture to coat them evenly, then transfer the coated cashews to your prepared baking tray.",
    "Make sure to spread the cashews evenly across the baking tray to form one layer.",
    "Otherwise, your cashews will not roast evenly; some may burn while others remain too raw.",
    "Roast the cashews in the oven for five minutes.",
    "Remove the cashews after this time and stir using a large spoon or spatula.",
    "This coats your cashews evenly with the sweet and spicy mixture, and promotes even cooking.",
    "Roast the cashews for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until done.",
    "The nuts should smell pleasantly strong and look slightly darkened when finished.",
    "Make sure that you stir the cashews every three to five minutes as they finish cooking.",
    "If you cook them without stirring, they\u2019ll be more likely to burn or cook unevenly.",
    "Sprinkle the cashews with sugar and salt.",
    "Remove the cashews and let cool for five minutes, then sprinkle the warm nuts with the sugar and salt.",
    "Toss gently to coat.",
    "It may help to combine the sugar and salt in a small, clean bowl prior to sprinkling the ingredients over the cashews.",
    "Mixing them beforehand will make it easier to distribute an even amount of both over the nuts.",
    "Cool fully before enjoying.",
    "Let the nuts cool fully before serving, or transfer them to an airtight storage container for later enjoyment.",
    "These cashews should stay good for about one week when kept at room temperature."
