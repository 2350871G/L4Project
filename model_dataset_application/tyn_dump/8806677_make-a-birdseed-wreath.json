Be thorough; all surfaces should have a light layer of shortening. Failing to do this could result in your wreath sticking in the mold. Frequently, stuck wreaths break or crack during removal."

Add a half cup (118 ml) of water to the pot or kettle over high heat. When it is lightly boiling, turn off the heat. If more convenient, you can also heat the water in a microwave safe bowl or dish. Heat the water until it is steaming or near boiling."

          "description":"Add the gelatin, hot water, corn syrup, and flour to the bowl. Stir it with a utensil, like a wooden spoon, until it thickens to paste-like consistency. Add the birdseed to the mixture and continue to stir until the seed is evenly distributed. Using more gelatin should make a sturdier, more resilient wreath. If you have issues with wreaths cracking or breaking, add more gelatin."

          "description":"Some gelatins may dry in as few as eight hours. You can test the mixture by pressing its surface gently with your finger. If it\u2019s soft, it needs more time to dry. For the best results, you may want to wait 48 hours, when the mixture will be fully hardened. Your gelatin may be ready in as few as two hours if placed in a refrigerator to harden. When the mixture is hard to the touch, remove it from the fridge."

Loop another length of ribbon around the wreath and fasten the ends in a simple knot so you can hang your wreath on hooks, nails, posts, and so on. Using a heavy fastener, like rope, may be too rough on your wreath and cause it to break. Prioritize lightweight fasteners, like ribbon and twine."

When it hardens, thread ribbon through the hole for hanging. To prevent unique mold shapes from falling apart too soon, you may want to add a little more gelatin to these.

For this wreath, you\u2019ll need 3 blocks of suet, a half cup (118 ml) of peanut butter, and 9 cups (2.1 L) of birdseed. To prepare a suet peanut butter wreath:\nLiquify three blocks of suet over low heat in a large pot. Stir the suet as it heats with a wooden spoon. Do not bring the suet to a boil. When melted, add the peanut butter to the suet. Continue to stir, and when the mixture is consistent throughout and fully melted, remove it from the heat. Mix in the birdseed with your spoon. Transfer the suet to a Bundt pan or similar mold that has been coated with non-stick spray. Let the mixture harden overnight in a refrigerator."
