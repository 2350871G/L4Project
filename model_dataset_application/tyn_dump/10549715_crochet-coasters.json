Cotton yarn works best for making coasters since it will absorb the moisture at the bottom of your cup. How to Choose Yarn Colors for Coasters\nOpt for dark colors to avoid visible stains, such as black, navy, plum, burgundy, and dark green. Make seasonal coasters for something festive, such as black and orange coasters for Halloween or red and green coasters for Christmas. Choose yarn colors that will match your china, tablecloth, or other items on your table, such as yellow coasters with a white tablecloth, or purple coasters to match purple mugs and plates."
