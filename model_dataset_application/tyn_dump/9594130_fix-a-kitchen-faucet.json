Leaks almost always emanate from either the faucet\u2019s base or the spout. Knowing where the leak is will help you determine what parts are responsible for the leak. Turn the faucet\u2019s water supply off. Look under your sink first. You may see a pair of valves you can turn clockwise to stop water from flowing into the faucet. If the valves aren\u2019t there, turn off the main water line. It is usually indoors, in the basement, next to the water meter. Turn the faucet on to relieve the water pressure.

A screwdriver can also be helpful for scraping away debris inside the faucet\u2019s parts. Fixing a Ball Faucet Use an Allen wrench to remove the handle. Lift the handle and look for a small hole underneath it, near the faucet's stem. Use the Allen wrench to turn the screw counterclockwise until you can lift the handle off of the faucet. Tighten the adjusting ring to fix leaks in the handle\u2019s base. Grip the top of the metal cap with a spanner tool. Turn the cap clockwise to tighten the white, plastic ring inside of it.
