          "description":"This type of indigo tolerates cold weather best, though it may not thrive if your area has long winters, meaning longer than 4 months. It's a subshrub, which means it's thinner than a shrub, and will grow to about 3 to 6 feet (0.91 to 1.83 m). Keep in mind that Isatis tintoria has only 1/4 of the dye pigment contained in other varieties of indigo, so it may need additional plants if you want to create your own dye. Although indigo plants are perennials, they behave as an annual in non-tropical climates. However, varieties other than Isatis tinctoria may not grow into full-sized plants in non-tropical regions. You should choose seeds that are less than 2 years old, as older seeds are unlikely to germinate."
