Sequins or other glued-on, glittery items will probably not survive a wash, either.

It's best to use a machine without an agitator. Never use a high-powered laundromat machine. Use a very small amount of mild detergent, such as Woolite, or just use the vinegar solution you made. If you go with detergent, a teaspoon or so will do, depending on the size of the stuffed animal. Soap nuts also have hypoallergenic properties, which are good if your child has a dust mite allergy.
