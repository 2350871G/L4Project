If you are  planning to transfer to synthetic fabric, make sure that you test it out with similar fabric first. Your transfer will probably not fare well on stretchy fabric. The stretchier the fabric, the more wear and tear your transfer will have to endure. This is why transfers are often on linen or canvas."

Some people say that if you use Mod Podge transfer medium, you can use inkjet images as well as laserjet images. If your image has text, you need to flip it horizontally on the computer in order to get the image to transfer correctly.

If your image faded, you may have washed before waiting 24 hours. If your image peeled off, you may not have rounded your edges very well. You need to iron on a hard surface, keep your iron at maximum heat, and apply a great deal of pressure when ironing.
