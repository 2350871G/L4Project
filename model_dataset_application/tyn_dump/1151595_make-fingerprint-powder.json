Avoid trying to lift prints from soft, pliable surfaces. These surfaces require a special fingerprinting chemical. Dust the powder over the print.

Identifying Fingerprints Catalogue your family. Ask each of your family members for a fingerprint. Tape the fingerprints on a notecard or a white sheet of paper. Record each family member\u2019s name, birthday, and gender. You can catalogue one finger or all ten if you\u2019d like. If you record all ten fingers, it will be easier to identify found prints.
