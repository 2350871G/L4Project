Set the mitre box on your work surface so it sits flat and locate the screw holes on the front and back. Feed screws into the holes on the mitre box and secure them to the work surface using a screwdriver or drill. You can buy a mitre box from your local hardware store or online.Variation: If can\u2019t screw directly into your work surface, place a piece of scrap wood underneath the mitre box and screw into it. Clamp the scrap wood to your work surface so it doesn\u2019t move around."

Draw a line across the board so it lines up with your measurement. Align the bottom of a protractor along the long edge of the wood so the line you drew points to 90 degrees. Set a 45-degree angle on the protractor, and trace the angled line to the other side of the wood. Make sure the end of the angled line doesn\u2019t extend further along the board than your initial measurement, or else the piece won\u2019t be the proper size."

Continue guiding the wood until the guide line you drew aligns with the slots on the mitre box that have the same angle. Hold the piece of wood securely against the front side and bottom of the mitre box with your nondominant hand. You can also clamp the piece of wood down with a C-clamp if you want to keep your hands free. Don\u2019t keep the finished side of the wood face-up since it won\u2019t leave as clean of a cut."

Position the side of the back saw closest to the handle in the slot at the front of your mitre box. Slowly lower the front end of the saw into the slot on the back side of the box that follows the same angle. You can buy a back saw from your local hardware store. You can also use a regular handsaw, but it may flex easier and make a crooked cut. Usually, mitre boxes have 2 slots that are 45-degree angles and 1 slot that cuts at a 90-degree angle."

    "Avoid using only wood glue since the boards could break apart more easily.",
    "Drill pocket holes for screws if you want to hide the joint easier.",
    "Flip your boards over so the unfinished side faces up.",
    "Place a pocket hole guide box against the end of one of the mitred corners and use a drill to make at least 2 holes in one of the boards.",
    "Clamp the boards so they form a tight corner and feed wood screws into the holes you drilled.",
    "Use a screwdriver to turn the screws clockwise and secure the boards together.",
    "Avoid using pocket holes if you have wood that\u2019s thinner than \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) since the screws will break through the other side.",
    "You can also apply wood glue if you want the joint to be more permanent.",
    "Add dowels to the ends of the boards if you don\u2019t want to use hardware.",
    "Cut wooden dowels with a saw so they\u2019re short enough to fit at a 45-degree angle between the boards.",
    "Drill 2 holes into the ends of the boards that are the same diameter as the dowels and are half as deep.",
    "Feed the dowels into one of the boards and pound them in tightly.",
    "Line up the dowels with the holes on the other mitred edge and press them together to form a tight corner.",
    "Dowels work well for pieces of wood that are thicker than \u20444 inch (1.9 cm).Tip: Add wood glue before pressing the pieces together if you want to join them permanently.",
    "Dry-fit the pieces before using wood glue to ensure the corners line up before gluing them."
