Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and saute it for 1 minute. Stir in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of white wine and turn up the heat so the liquid starts to simmer. Remove it from the heat. You can substitute water or broth for the white wine. If you use chicken or vegetable broth, the sauce may not be very white."

Heat the sauce over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes while you stir constantly. Heating the sauce over low heat will help the cheese dissolve into the sauce. Just ensure that the sauce doesn't simmer or boil because it could curdle and separate."
