Soak the sorghum overnight so the sorghum absorbs some of the water. Drain the sorghum through a colander. Chewy sorghum is a great replacement for bulgar wheat or couscous in tabbouleh or falafel recipes. If you don't have time to soak the sorghum, you can skip soaking it, although the texture of the sorghum might just be a little nubbier."

Stir in 1 cup (192 g) of whole-grain sorghum. If you'd like extra flavor, stir in 1 teaspoon (6 g) of kosher salt. Insert the inner pot and close the cooker. Place the pot with sorghum and water into the pressure cooker. Place the lid directly onto the pressure cooker and turn it about 30 degrees so it's securely shut. Turn the pressure cooker on and cook the sorghum for 20 to 25 minutes. Adjust the pressure of your cooker to 15 psi (pound force per square inch). Cook the sorghum for 20 minutes.
