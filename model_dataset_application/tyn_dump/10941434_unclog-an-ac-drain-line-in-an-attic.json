Make sure you also have an attachment that will connect the wet/dry vac to the drain line. An attachment with a \u20444 in (1.9 cm) opening should work well. If you don\u2019t own a wet/dry vac, you can rent one from most large home improvement stores, or purchase one for anywhere between $25 and $550. More expensive models are designed for heavy use by contractors and home renovators. For a job like unclogging an AC drain line, a cheaper model should work well enough."
