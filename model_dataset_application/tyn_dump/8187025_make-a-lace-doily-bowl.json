If you decide to work with a balloon, blow it up however big you want it to be, then set it down into a cup. The mold needs to be big enough so that doily doesn't hang over the edges when you place it on top. Place a couple of dried beans, some dried rice, or a marble into the balloon before you blow it up. When you put it into the cup, the beans/rice/marbles will act as weights and help keep the balloon steady."
