Pull the end of the thread through the eye until the ends are even. Then, tie a double knot to secure the 2 ends of thread together. Make sure to choose a matching color 100% polyester thread to sew buttons onto your coat. This is a strong, durable thread that will keep your buttons secure. Tip: If you have trouble getting the thread to go through the eye, lick the end, wet it with a drop of water, or rub the thread against the side of a candle. This will stiffen the thread and make it easier to push it through the eye."
