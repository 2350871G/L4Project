If there are any areas that are caked in dirt, scrub them until they come clean or use a vegetable brush for a little extra cleaning power. Pat the squash dry with clean paper towels. Even if you\u2019re not planning on eating the skin, it\u2019s still a good idea to clean it off completely.

Use a large kitchen knife to easily cut through the skin. If the squash is particularly hard to cut into, use a kitchen cleaver to get through it.

If the fork doesn\u2019t penetrate the squash easily, put it back in the oven for 10 more minutes. Smaller squashes, like the acorn squash, may only need 30 to 45 minutes in the oven. A safe way to roast squash is to start the timer at 30 minutes, check the doneness after those 30 minutes, and then continue baking the squash in 10 minute increments from there.

Sage has an earthy flavor and is very aromatic. You can leave the leaves in the sauce or take them out. Raw sage leaves don\u2019t taste great or have a nice texture when chewed, but since the leaves will have been cooked in butter, the choice is up to you."

Cook the squash for an extra 10 to 15 minutes to ensure the squash itself, as well as the meat, is cooked through. Chorizo, spicy or sweet sausages, and bacon all pair well with the flavor of different squashes. Goat cheese, mozzarella, and blue cheese are also great accompaniments.
