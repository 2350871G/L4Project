  "text":" Soaking the Rice First Pour one cup of rice into a bowl. Use a measuring cup when dumping your rice into a bowl. Deviating from the quantity of ingredients will make your rice over or undercooked. If you want to make 2 or more cups of rice, maintain the same ratio of other ingredients. You typically want to keep a 1:1.5 or 1:2 ratio of rice to water. Fill the bowl with water to submerge your rice. Use your sink to fill your bowl up with water. Don\u2019t let it overflow or some rice may be lost. The water should just cover the surface of the rice. Swirl the rice around with a spoon for 1 minute. Swirling your rice will remove the starch from it, which is the traditional method used to cook basmati rice. The water in your bowl should now look murky and cloudy. Removing the starch will prevent your rice from being overly sticky, which is popular among Japanese and Korean dishes. Drain the water out of the bowl. You can use a colander or a fine-mesh sieve to drain your rice. Make sure that all the water is drained out and you\u2019re not letting rice fall into your sink. If you don\u2019t have a sieve or colander, you can tip your bowl on an angle to drain it. Make sure you aren\u2019t tipping the bowl too much or the rice may fall out. Repeat steps 2-4 until the water becomes clear instead of murky. Continue to wash your rice and drain it, until the water in the bowl ceases to be murky. This indicates that you\u2019ve washed away the rice\u2019s starch and it can now attain a traditional basmati texture, once cooked. This process will usually take 3 to 4 times before your rice is free of excess starch. Fill up bowl again and let rice soak for 30 minutes. Allowing the grains to soak will expand them, adding to the texture of the rice. Another added benefit to soaking is that the expanded grains are capable of soaking up more sauce from your dishes. Cooking Rice on the Stove Add 1 3/4th cups of water inside of a deep saucepan or pot. If you are using 1 cup of rice, use anywhere from 1 \u00bd to 2 cups of water. Adding more water will make your rice more fluffy, while less water will make it taste tougher. Don\u2019t add too little water or your rice may not fully cook or come out burned.

Do not uncover the lid on your pot, because you\u2019ll let the steam that\u2019s cooking your rice out. Do not stir the rice or it may become broken and mushy. Let stand for 5 minutes and fluff with fork before serving. Letting the rice stand for 5 minutes allows unfinished grains to fully cook, and the remainder of the water to evaporate. Afterwards, make sure to fluff it with a fork. Fluffing rice with a fork separates the grains so there are no large clumps and the rice maintains a fluffy and light texture. Cooking Rice in the Microwave Fill a bowl with a 1:2 ratio of rice and water. In a single, microwaveable bowl, add one cup of rice, and two cups of water. If you want to make more rice, make sure to add more water at the same ratio. For example, for 2 cups of rice you\u2019d use 4 cups of water, for 3 cups of rice, 6 cups of water. Make sure you have a big enough bowl. Place in microwave and cook for 6-7 minutes on high, uncovered. Amount of time you keep your rice in the microwave depends on its wattage. For a 750W microwave keep your rice cooking for 6 minutes. For a 650W microwave keep your rice in for 7 minutes. Cover bowl with microwavable plastic wrap, leaving a vent on the side. Covering your bowl with plastic wrap will steam it and completely cook it. Do not poke holes on the top of the plastic wrap. Make sure to use wrap that can be microwaved. Reduce microwave to medium (350W) and cook for another 15 minutes. Refer to your microwave\u2019s instruction manual to see how to reduce its settings to medium. Not reducing the settings could result in overcooked or burnt rice. Do not stir your rice at any time during the cooking process. Let stand for 5 minutes and fluff with fork before serving. Your rice should not be completely cooked. Fluff with your fork to break up the rice before serving it. Be careful when taking the bowl out of the microwave. It will be hot.",
