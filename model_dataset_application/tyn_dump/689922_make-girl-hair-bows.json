Holding the first loop securely with your thumb and forefinger, make a second loop on the opposite side. You should see the shape of a bow coming together. Make a third and fourth loop, using the same technique. The fourth loop should come down across the center of the ribbon (from left to right) to form the second tail of the bow.
