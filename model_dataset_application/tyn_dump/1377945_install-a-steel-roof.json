Take this number with you to a home goods store where they will be able to assist you in figuring out how many shingles you should buy. Make sure to actually get up onto the roof instead of just estimating. Be very careful while you are on the roof, and only do this in dry conditions. It\u2019s best to buy too many shingles rather than not enough, as it\u2019s obviously a hassle to run out. Make sure you buy ridge cap shingles if you\u2019re planning on putting shingles on the upper ridge of your roof also."

Make sure the harness is secure around your chest. Harnesses are really important to wear because of the risks associated with being so high off the ground. Strapping yourself in should be the first thing you do each time you start work each day."

Make sure that you hammer in a 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) nail every 12 inches (30 cm) so it stays down. When you start moving up the roof to put more down, make sure there is an overlap of about 6 inches (15 cm) with the previous underlayment you have put down. The underlayment is put down to provide a base surface to work on. It is breathable and helps the roof deal with condensation."

Hammer the nails in every 6 inches (15 cm). You can find a drip edge at any home goods store. Make sure you measure the length of the roof so you know what length drip edge to get. You should use 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) nails that are compatible with the metal being used which, in this case, is steel. This helps prevent corrosion."

Use a hammer to tap the shingle gently just to make sure it\u2019s securely in. Make sure the shingle is pushed right up to the left or right as far as it can go. This ensures that you are covering all of the roof. It doesn\u2019t matter which side you start on, but you do need to start in a corner.

There is one nail tab on the top right corner of the shingle where you must hammer in a nail. You should also place a nail clip approximately halfway across the top edge of the shingle, and hammer in a nail through there. The nail clips come together with the shingles so you will get them when you purchase the shingles. 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) nails are fine here, but a little bit of length either side of that measurement is also ok."

Once it\u2019s hooked in, slide it up and into place where it should lock in nicely. This process is almost exactly the same as the first shingle you installed. However, instead of attaching the shingle to the edge of the roof, as with the first shingle, you are attaching it to the previous shingle.

Then, mark how much shingle you need to cover the remaining roof. After this, cut off the portion of shingle you don\u2019t need, and install the remainder as usual. Use steel cutters to cut the shingle. You can find these at a home goods store and they are reasonably cheap. It can also be a good idea to wear gloves while doing this, as once you cut the steel, it becomes very sharp and can easily cause some nasty cuts."

If you\u2019re doing it yourself, these things often take a little bit longer than if a professional was doing it. This can be a good thing to get someone else to help you with, as you can work on more than one area of the roof at a time.
