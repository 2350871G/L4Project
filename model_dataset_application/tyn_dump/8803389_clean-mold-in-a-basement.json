If all you find is dust in the return registers, that\u2019s normal and you can vacuum or remove the registers to clean them. If you don\u2019t find any signs of mold, and no one in your household has unexplained illness, symptoms or allergies, your air ducts are most likely not contaminated.

Read online reviews or obtain a referral for a qualified mold remediation contractor. Check their references and ask what EPA recommendations or other professional guidelines they\u2019ll follow. For large areas of mold, the basement and HVAC may need to be sealed off with plastic sheeting. Contaminated water can occur from flooding or sewage backup. A strong, moldy odor may indicate unseen mold growth behind walls, under flooring or beneath baseboards. You may be able to obtain a free estimate detailing what services are needed. The average cost for mold remediation is about $7,500."

You can clean mold with diluted bleach, diluted Borax, undiluted vinegar, a baking soda solution, or 3% hydrogen peroxide. Depending on which method you choose, you can use a bucket or spray bottle to hold the solution. For hard surfaces, combine a gallon of water with a cup of bleach, or one part bleach to sixteen parts water. For porous surfaces, try one part non-ammonia, liquid dish detergent, ten parts bleach and twenty parts water. To use baking soda, combine 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (1 to 2 mL) baking soda with a full spray bottle of water. Alternately, combine 1/2 cup (118 mL) baking soda with one cup (250 mL) of water and one tablespoon (15 mL) of mild liquid detergent. Borax is safe for porous and nonporous materials.
