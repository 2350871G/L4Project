  "text":" Choose any yarn and any hook that feels comfortable with it. This project doesn't really have (or need) a gauge. A larger hook and gauge will make a larger net and faster work. Tie a slip knot and chain about six stitches. This makes the first of three optional hanging loops, so if you'd like the loop larger or smaller, chain more or fewer stitches. Slip stitch into the first stitch in the chain, forming the first optional hanging loop.  Chain any number you'd like. This chain will form one side of the triangular sling or hammock, so chain until you get the length that you will want (see tips). The chain could be anywhere from 18 inches (45.7 cm) to three feet or more for larger toys. Chain another six (or whatever number you used in step 2) for the second optional hanging loop. Slip stitch back into the chain, six stitches back. Chain four. Skip two stitches and double crochet into the third. Proceed across the rest of the first row as follows: chain two, skip two stitches in the row below and double crochet.  Turn the work and slip stitch into the first loop.  Chain four. A chain of four starts each subsequent row, too. Double crochet into the next loop.  Continue across the second row in the same manner: chain two, double crochet into the next loop. Don't worry if there's a stitch or two left over at the end. Continue adding rows until you are down to a single loop. This pattern naturally reduces with each subsequent row. Turn the work and slip stitch into this final ring to center in it a bit better.  Create the third optional hanging loop.
