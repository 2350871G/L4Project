If your image is in color, use an image editing program, such as Photoshop, to change the image to black-and-white so that it looks like a silhouette. If you are good at drawing, you can trace the image directly onto your fabric with a pencil. Band logos work great, but you can use any image you want."

If you have a bottom-loading paper, insert the paper with the glossy side facing up. Print your image, then let the ink dry. Freezer paper has a glossy side and a papery side. Make sure that you are printing onto the papery side. You can find freezer paper in the plastic wrap and tinfoil section of a grocery store. It is not the same thing as parchment paper or wax paper. Alternatively, you can lay the paper over your computer screen, then trace the image onto the papery side with a pen."

You can always go back and fill these spaces in later, if needed. Don't use an old craft blade. It won't give you sharp, clean cuts."

Press the iron against the paper for a few seconds until it sticks to the fabric. Canvas or denim fabric will work the best, but you can use other types of fabric too. The color does not matter here."

Apply the paint to the fabric in this manner, working your way from outside-in. Do not apply globs of paint.

If you can't find canvas, try another thick, sturdy material, such as denim or linen. Use a thin paintbrush to paint over your design. Note the colors in your image, then get acrylic paint in those colors. Squeeze out a dollop of each color onto a palette. Use a thin paintbrush to apply each color to your image. Save any details, such as outlines, for last. Use a synthetic taklon paintbrush for best results. Don't use camelhair or boar bristle. Don't worry if you have visible brushstrokes. This will give your patch some texture, just like in a real patch! Let the paint dry before you cut the patch out. If you want to embroider the edges of your patch, leave a thin border all around it. Make the border about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm), or thinner. Embroider around the patch, if desired. Choose embroidery thread that matches the outline of your image. Whipstitch all around the patch until you are back to where you started, then knot and cut your thread.
