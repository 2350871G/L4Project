While Orgreenic recommends the use of vegetable oil, other oils and vegetable shortening could be used, instead. If selecting another oil, opt for one with a high smoking point, like peanut oil, grapeseed oil, or canola oil, over one with a low smoking point, like olive oil. This technique can be used on all Orgreenic pans, including all stovetop pans, oven pans, and grill pans."

Expect this process to take several minutes. While you might be tempted to heat the oil on high heat, you need to keep the temperature control set to medium so that the oil heats up slowly. Otherwise, the oil may not seep into the surface thoroughly enough. Every few minutes, turn the pan to redistribute any oil that has begun to puddle or bead."
