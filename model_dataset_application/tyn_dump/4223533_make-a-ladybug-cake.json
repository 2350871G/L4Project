Add about a teaspoon of flour and shake the pan so the flour begins to stick to the grease. Tilt the pan on its side and tap the pan. Turn and tap until the entire bowl is evenly coated with flour. Greasing the pan not only ensures your cake will pop out easily, it helps the cake climb the sides of the pan and gives your it more volume. Turn the pan over and tap gently to remove any excess flour. If you are baking a chocolate cake, you may want to use cocoa powder to prevent a white film that may be left by the flour."

You can use a core shaped like a nail, placing the \"head\" of the nail on the bottom with the spike pointing upward, or one that is shaped like a long, narrow plug, with the opening pointing up. You can bake this cake without a heating core, but the depth of the pan means you may over-brown the exposed top and sides of your cake. A heating core may also prevent your cake from deflating or sagging in the middle."

If you use a plug-shaped heating core, don't forget to fill the core with cake batter, too. Fill it a little higher than the level of batter outside the core. The plug-shaped bit of cake will fit into the hole created by the core once it's removed."

Test the cake by skewering near the center (but not inside the heating core) with a toothpick or kebab stick. If the stick comes out clean (a few crumbs is ok), then the cake is ready.

Otherwise, place the cooling rack on top of the pan. Holding the rack against the pan, carefully turn them upside-down, together, so the rack is on the bottom you can lift the pan off the cake. You can loosen the sides by gently running a knife around the edges. Allow the cake to cool for at least an hour.

Spread a thick layer of icing on the cake, then place the larger, bottom part of your cake on top. You are building your cake upside-down in the pan. Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes.

Try placing the pan in a hot water bath for about three minutes and then turn it over onto the platter. Unwrap the saran wrap. Your cake should be a nice, seamless hemisphere, or bowl shape. You can also heat the pan with a hairdryer or blowtorch to help force the bowl to release the cake. Place the plattered cake on your cake wheel or turn table.

Use an even amount of pressure for each star to keep a uniform size. Constantly refill your piping bag with frosting, especially when it starts to get soft.
