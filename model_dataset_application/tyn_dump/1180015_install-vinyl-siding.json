It is also a favorite for homeowners who don't want the hassle of repainting the outside of their house periodically. Before you decide to install vinyl siding on your own home, visit some vinyl sided houses and inspect them thoroughly to make sure you like what you see. Ask a local realtor about how installing vinyl siding on your home might affect the value of the house -- although it will have a positive effect in most places, if your house is the only one with vinyl siding in a neighborhood of restored Victorian homes, it could bring the value down. Decide what type of vinyl you want -- vinyl siding comes in textured or smooth, high gloss or low gloss finishes. It also comes in a wide array of colors, some with grain-like patterns which closely resemble real wood."

Installing vinyl siding is an involved process which requires a lot of time and skill. In fact, the quality of the installation can have a huge effect the finished result and even determine how long the siding lasts. Even the highest quality siding will buckle and warp if not installed correctly. If you choose to get a contractor, gather a list of names in your local area and request a price estimate from each of them.

In terms of tools, you will need: a folding ruler, a metal square, a claw hammer, a snap-lock punch, tin snips, a power saw, a chalk line, a  measuring tape, a level, a utility knife, a pliers, a nail slot punch, a carpenter's saw, a hacksaw, a stepladder, sawhorses and a pry bar. In terms of materials, you will need: lengths of J-channel, flashing, building paper, corrosion-resistant nails and enough vinyl siding to cover your home.

One of the major issues with vinyl siding is that it masks moisture problems and other structural defects. Therefore it's important to fix any existing issues before you install the siding. Tighten any loose boards and replace any rotting ones. Scrape away any old caulk from around doors and windows. Clear your work area by removing any fixtures such as exterior lights, down-spouts, moulding, mailboxes and house numbering.

Vinyl siding expands and contracts with temperature changes, therefore it is important to allow extra room for expansion in order to prevent the siding from buckling. Leave an extra \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) gap between siding panels and any accessories. You should also refrain from driving the nails too tightly, restricting the movement of the panels.You should leave about \u204416 inch (0.2 cm) between the nail head and the siding, to allow for movement and prevent waves from forming in the panels. In addition, you need to center each nail in the appropriate slot, making sure to drive the nails in straight rather than crooked. You should never face nail (drive nails through the panels) when installing siding, as this may cause the panels to buckle."

If you have to cut the last row of siding, you'll need to use a length of J-channel on the top edge of the siding (instead of utility trim).

    "Once the J-channel is installed and the soffit pieces are cut, you will be able install them.",
    "You can do this by pressing the soffit pieces into the channel, bending them to fit if necessary (vinyl siding is quite flexible).",
    "If you're having difficulty just pressing them in, you may need to pull the channel lip back with a pry bar or locking tool to get the siding panels to fit .",
    "Slide in the fascia siding pieces.",
    "Once the soffit pieces are installed, remove the gutter/downspout and slide the lengths of fascia siding under the gutter apron.",
    "Secure the top edge of the fascia pieces with galvanized or painted nails placed every couple of feet.",
    "Reattach the gutters.",
    "Siding the Walls Measure the walls.",
    "Measure the length of the walls from the eaves to the bottom of any existing siding.",
    "This will help you to figure out how many panels of siding you'll need per wall.",
    "Divide the length of each wall by 8 inches (the width of a piece of siding).",
    "If the result is a whole number, you're in luck: you'll be able to install the pieces of siding without leaving any gaps or needing to cut any pieces to size.",
    "But if the result is not a whole number, you will need to cut the final piece of siding (lengthwise) in order to fill in the remaining space.",
    "If you have to cut the last row of siding, you'll need to use a length of J-channel on the top edge of the siding (instead of utility trim).",
    "You will also need to nail a strip of 1/2-inch (12.7-mm) plywood, 3 inches (76.2 mm) wide to the channel to support it.",
    "Install a starter strip.",
    "Once you've decided where you want the siding to begin, drive a nail through a point on your chosen starting height and snap a chalk line around the perimeter of the house.",
    "Nail a piece of plywood about 3.5 inches (89 mm) thick along the top of the chalk line -- this will hold out the bottom of the first row of siding.",
    "Attach the starter strip to the plywood, but don't nail it so tightly that it will restrict the strip's movement.",
    "Remember to leave \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) between each starter strip to allow room for expansion.",
    "Install the corner posts.",
    "Install 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) foam sheathing strips on both sides of each corner, then install your corner siding pieces to these strips.",
    "The corner posts should run from \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) below the bottom of the starter strip to just beneath the eaves, after the soffit pieces have been installed.",
    "Make sure the corner siding pieces are completely straight before you secure them.",
    "Once you're satisfied, nail them to the adjoining walls, working from top to bottom.",
    "Install J-channel around windows and doors.",
    "The next step is to install J-channel around all four sides of exterior doors and windows.",
    "Place the J-channel snugly against the casing and nail it to the wall -- remembering not to nail too tightly, to allow for movement.",
    "Begin installing the wall siding.",
    "Apply any necessary insulation materials to the walls before you begin to install the siding.",
    "Measure and cut the lengths of siding, so that each panel ends 1/4 inch (12.7 mm) shy of the vertical trim pieces, to allow for expansion.",
    "If you are installing the siding in freezing conditions, you should leave \u20448 inch (1.0 cm) instead.",
    "Slide the bottom row of panels into place, making sure to hook the bottom lip of each panel under the starting strip.",
    "Secure the panels with a nail every 16 inches (40.6 cm) or so -- remembering to center the nail in slot and leave 1/16 of the nail head above the vinyl siding, to allow for movement and expansion.",
    "Overlap adjoining panels.",
    "When joining two lengths of siding together, overlap them by about 1 inch (25.40 mm).",
    "When deciding which side to overlap on, choose the side that will be least obvious from the front or most used area of your house.",
    "For example, if your driveway is located to the right of your house, then a right over left overlap will be least noticeable.",
    "Install siding around windows.",
    "When you get to a window, you will need to cut sections from the panels directly above and below it to fit.",
    "Measure the width of the piece you need to cut by holding the length of siding against the window and marking the edge points on the panel with a pencil.",
    "Leave on extra \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) of clearance on either side of these marks.",
    "Measure the height of the piece you need to cut by butting a scrap piece of siding beneath (and above) the window and marking the necessary height, leaving an additional \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) of clearance.",
    "Transfer this measurement onto the piece of siding.",
    "Make the vertical cuts on the siding panel with a saw and make the horizontal cut with a utility knife, then snap out the piece.",
    "Install the cut pieces of siding above and below the windows, as normal.",
    "Install the top row of siding.",
    "When you reach the top row of siding, you will need to measure and cut it to fit.",
    "To determine how much you will need to cut from the top of the panel, measure the distance between the top of the under-sill trim and the lock on the next panel down, then subtract \u20444 inch (0.6 cm).",
    "When you cut the top siding panel to the appropriate height you will be removing the nailing strip.",
    "Use a snap-lock punch tool to punch the top edge of the panel along 6 inch (15.2 cm) intervals, making sure the raised material is on the outside.",
    "Slot the bottom edge of the panel into the panel below and slide the top edge under the under-sill trim.",
    "The raised slots you made with the snap-lock punch will catch onto the trim and hold the top siding panel firmly in place -- so there is no need to face nail it to secure."
