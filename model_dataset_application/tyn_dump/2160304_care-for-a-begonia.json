          "description":"When potting your begonias, you should keep three factors in mind: the type of soil, the size of pot, and the amount of soil you use. When choosing your potting material, you want the soil to be relatively neutral or slightly acidic on the pH scale. Your pot should roughly fit the size of your plant--you want to keep root growth in mind but do not want the pot to be overly large. A pot that is too large can lead to using too much soil. When a pot contains too much soil, it can lead to soggy soil that could potentially \u2018drown\u2019 your plant roots and kill your begonia. Some people also grow begonias in wet stones or small pebbles as a top medium. You don\u2019t have to completely bury the plant\u2019s rhizome to do this. Just place it on top of the stones."

Avoid southern windows from February through September, as they let in too much light, unless you hang thin curtains that filter the light. Be sure to filter the light coming from eastern or western windows if these face concrete or water. If you choose to use fluorescent lights, you should place it 6 to 12 inches above your plant.
