You may also see \u201cmi-cuit\u201d liver, which has been partially cooked through slow poaching. This type of foie gras is also ready to eat right away, having a softer flavor due to the longer cooking time. Mi-cuit foie gras can be stored for about 3 months. Cuit foie gras can last for years on your shelf. Raw foie gras is \u201ccru.\u201d Since it is fresh, it only lasts a few days in your refrigerator. It is served warm."

          "description":"You do not need to add butter or cooking oil to the pan. Simply turn on the heat and let the pan warm up for about 5 minutes. Get the pan as hot as possible so it sears the liver right away. To test this, place a few drops a water in the pan. If they evaporate right away, your pan should be ready to go. Foie gras, especially the duck variety, is very fatty. The fat in butter and oil can make the taste even richer than usual. If you wish to try using oil, pour about 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of olive or canola oil into the pan before heating it."

If it is finished, it will have a deep, brown color. Flip it over and cook the other side the same way. If you have a big piece of foie gras, try slicing it first so it cooks completely. Cleaning raw foie gras isn\u2019t essential. Foie gras has a lot of stringy nerves, but they melt during the cooking process. If you want to make sure they are gone, pull them off by hand before slicing. Leaving the foie gras in the pan for too long causes it to shrink and look greasy."

You should put the foie gras in the refrigerator for between 2 to 5 minutes to chill it slightly, unless you are eating a pat\u00e9. This will prevent the foie gras from crumbling when you cut it. For pat\u00e9, leave the liver in its container or in a covered dish on your counter until it reaches room temperature. Most people find the taste from hot foie gras to be overwhelming, so chilling it can improve its flavor. If it gets too cold, though, you may lose some of its taste and texture."

Smaller slices usually leave you wanting more since you don't get an adequate taste of the liver's complex flavor. For the best results, cut the foie gras when it is chilled or at room temperature. The average serving is 1.7 to 2.5 oz (48 to 71 g) when served as a starter or 3.5 to 5.3 oz (99 to 150 g) when prepared as a main course. Note that only \u201ctorchon\u201d foie gras, which comes in the shape of a log or loaf, needs to be cut. \u201cTerrine\u201d foie gras comes pre-cooked in a terrine mold and should be served directly in the terrine."

Simply pick up the slices and place them on your desired serving method, such as a plate or piece of bread. Eat the liver as is or serve it with accompaniments that compliment its flavor. Foie gras pat\u00e9 is soft and mushy, so you will need to use a butter knife to spread it like you would with butter, hummus or similar toppings. For instance, you can set the foie gras on a plate with apples, onion jam, or another component. Alternatively, lay the foie gras on top of a piece of bread. Enjoy the foie gras by by biting into it or breaking off pieces with a fork or spoon. Whether you serve it with accompaniments or not, let it melt in your mouth."

This is because the taste of foie gras can get lost when it is buried behind other foods. Serve it early in a meal so you can enjoy the dense flavor more completely. Foie gras can be easily served plain on a piece of bread as an appetizer. You may want to add fruits and sauces if you incorporate it into a meal. If you serve both goose and duck foie gras, start with the goose. The fuller flavor of the duck liver can overpower the creamy, delicate taste of the goose liver."

Cut off a slice of bread about the same size as a slice of foie gray. Lay the foie gras on top of the bread and enjoy it with your hands. Country-style bread is commonly used with foie gras, but sourdough bread has become a popular choice as well. You can also pair foie gras with brioche or fruit bread. Sweet fruits, such as figs and apricots, compliment the rich flavor of the liver. Consider lightly toasting your bread to use as a warm, solid support for the foie gras."

          "headline":"Pair the foie gras with acidic fruits for additional flavor.",
          "description":"Various fruits, including green apples, strawberries, and cherries, can be served in slices along with the foie gras. Try spreading fruit preserves over a piece of bread or pouring a fruit sauce over foie gras on a plate. Tart and acidic fruits cut through the sweet, rich taste of foie gras, creating a balanced dish that hits a range of flavors. Sweet and sour items are among the best options. Try a cranberry jelly, citrus sauce, or an Asian-inspired chutney. Dried fruit like figs and prunes work well with foie gras. Stone fruits such as peaches, plums, nectarines, and sour cherries also work. Another option is to make an acidic sauce such as an onion jam or green apple sauce mixed with balsamic vinegar. Also consider liquor-based sauces such as caramel mixed with cognac or sherry."

          "headline":"Use a light amount of dressing if you include a salad.",
          "description":"Salads make for light side dishes when paired with foie gras, but you have to be careful about how much dressing you use. Put the salad in a mixing bowl, then pour a sparing amount of the dressing on top of it. Mix the salad until it is lightly coated, adding more as needed, then add the foie gras slices on top of it. A balsamic vinaigrette dressing is a great choice since it has a sweet, tart taste that contrasts well with the liver. However, you can use other dressings if you prefer. You can make your own dressing by mixing 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of balsamic vinegar with 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of olive oil. Be careful not to use too much oil, since the fat in it can make the fatty liver difficult to stomach."

Also try a sweet wines from the Alsace or Loire Valley regions in France. German Rieslings are another sweet choice that can bring the most out of your foie gras. You aren\u2019t limited to only those wines. Additional options include Juran\u00e7on, Monbazillac, Bergerac, and Gewurztraminer. You may even wish to try the liver alongside a port wine. Champagne has not traditionally been paired with foie gras, but it has become a popular option. Use a dry champagne to avoid overwhelming your taste buds with too much sweetness. Ask your guests for opinions. Some people may say that wine distracts from the taste of foie gras and forego it."
