          "description":"Sharpening might not be necessary if you're only roughly hollowing out a piece of wood. However, a sharpened chisel will remove wood more cleanly as you hollow it out, resulting in a more polished finished product. To sharpen a chisel, drag its end back and forth across a sharpening stone in a figure-eight shape that extends the entire length of the stone. To hone the beveled (angled) side of chisels, keep the bevel flush with the coarse side of the sharpening stone as you drag it back and forth. After honing the bevel, turn the bevel-side up, hold it flat to the fine side of the sharpening stone, and drag it back and forth same as the beveled side."

The steeper the angle you hold the chisel, the deeper it will cut into the wood. Control the depth by adjusting the angle the chisel forms with the wood."

          "headline":"Hit the chisel with a mallet to hollow out the wood.",
          "description":"For better control, keep the angle of your chisel low to the wood so you only remove a little bit at a time. With your non-dominant hand, hold the chisel at about its middle. Tap the handle end of the chisel with a mallet to shave away wood. Many woodworking chisels are intended to be used with rubber woodworking mallets. Only use a metal hammer with heavy-duty chisels. Sometimes, it's difficult to break through the surface of the wood. Give your chisel some help by etching a small groove into the wood with a utility knife. Generally, you should chisel in the same direction the grain of the wood flows. This will decrease cracking and unclean breaks."

          "description":"Position the chisel close to the end of the piece of wood. Hold the chisel straight up-and-down with the wood so they form an L-shape. Hit the chisel firmly with a mallet until the chisel is about a half inch (1.3 cm) deep, then pop the chunk off the end. Splinters and wood shavings are sometimes sent flying by chopping cuts. Always wear safety glasses when using this technique. The chopping cut works best at the ends of pieces of wood. Using this cut in the center of a solid piece will likely make it crack. A blunt chisel won't work well for this technique. Only use a well-sharpened chisel when performing a chopping cut."
