          "description":"Set your oven to bake or convection and let it start warming up. Sunchokes are somewhat tough and fibrous, so the heat needs to be pretty high to cook them all the way through. Get out a large pan or roasting dish that you can use to cook the sunchokes. Start prepping the sunchokes while the oven is preheating. You can also roast sunchokes and similar vegetables under a broiler, or wrapped in foil on a grill."

Using a sharp knife, cut the sunchokes into \u00bd\u201d slices. You can also chop them into small squares or wedges, if you prefer. Since these vegetables grow in the ground, it\u2019s important to clean them thoroughly before you eat them. The size and shape of the sunchokes is largely up to you. Just keep in mind that they will need more time in the oven to soften if they\u2019re left in bigger pieces."

          "description":"Transfer the sunchokes to the roasting dish and drizzle them with olive oil. Use enough oil to form a nice even layer over each one, but don\u2019t completely drown them. Toss the sunchokes by hand to help coat them better. Add a pinch of kosher salt, a couple crushed cloves of garlic and a minced sprig of parsley or rosemary. For a sweeter touch, go with herbs like ginger, cloves and mint. Pour on your oil slowly so that you don\u2019t overdo it. You can always add more later, but you can\u2019t take it back."

          "description":"Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, it\u2019s time to put the sunchokes in. Set a timer for 15 minutes and keep an eye on them while they roast. After the 15 minutes is up, poke one or two with a fork to see if they\u2019re sufficiently soft. The sunchokes will be done when the edges just begin to brown. There will be some variation in cook times for dense, temperamental veggies like sunchokes, so rely on your own senses to determine when they\u2019re done in addition to the timer you set. Try roasting sunchokes along with new potatoes, purple carrots, parsnips and squash for a mild, autumn-inspired root vegetable medley."

Ordinarily it\u2019s okay to leave the skin on if you\u2019re roasting or frying, but for mashed sunchokes it\u2019s better to remove it in order to achieve a smooth, creamy consistency.

Pulse the mixture together until it forms a thick, batter-like puree. Serve the mashed sunchokes while they\u2019re still hot. Unlike vegetables like potatoes or cauliflower, which can be mashed using a hand masher or egg beater, sunchokes need heavy-duty treatment in order to soften and smooth them. Try not to leave any lumps or chunks in your mashed sunchokes. These bits may be mushy and slightly chewy, which will throw off the texture of the completed dish."

Try not to overcrowd your pan. This will make the sunchokes harder to turn and fry to a consistent finish. Depending on how much you\u2019re planning on making, you may have to cook them in batches.
