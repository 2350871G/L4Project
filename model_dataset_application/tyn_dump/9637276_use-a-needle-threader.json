If you're right-handed, for instance, you'll hold the tool in your right hand, while left-handed sewers will use their left. You\u2019ll have much more coordination that way, which will allow you to focus on manipulating the small items you\u2019ll be working with. Make sure you\u2019re gripping the needle so that the eye is pointing upwards. Those with unsteady hands may find it helpful to stabilize the needle using a pincushion or piece of cork.
