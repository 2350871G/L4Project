  "text":" Setting up the Game Get two or more players together. Scattergories is recommended for two or more players, so you will need at least one other person to play. If there are only two of you, though, the game can end up being slow and quiet, and so not as fun. If you have a large number of players, it can also be fun to play Scattergories with teams. For example, if there are six of you, then you can divide into two teams of three or three teams of two. Make sure each player has everything they need to play the game. The current edition of the game comes with an hourglass timer, a 20-sided die, six cardboard folders, six copies of each of the 13 category cards, and a pad of answer sheets. Each player or team will need a folder, an answer sheet, and pens or pencils to play the game. Insert one answer sheet into the slot in your (or your team's) folder. Each answer sheet has three columns, one for each round of the game. Each column has spaces for 12 answers. Older editions of the game came with pencils, but newer ones do not. You should make sure that everybody who wants to play has something to write with. Set out a die-rolling surface. The 20-sided die that comes with the Scattergories game is large and heavy. It might damage surfaces made from glass or soft wood. If you are worried about damaging your playing surface, put out a piece of cardboard to roll the die on. Older editions of Scattergories may include a die-rolling board along with the other components of the game. Playing the Game Give each player or team one copy of the same category card. This is the category card that everybody will use during the first round of the game. Each category card shows 12 different categories. The game also comes with blank category cards so you can make your own categories if you want. Roll the die to select a letter. Scattergories comes with a 20-sided die that shows every letter of the alphabet except for Q, U, V, X, Y, and Z, as it can be challenging to think of a wide enough variety of words that start with these letters. To select the letter that you will use in the first round, roll the die and announce the letter that comes up to the other players. Start the timer. Scattergories includes an hourglass that takes around three minutes to run out. Once the letter has been announced, make sure all the players are ready. Then turn over the hourglass to start the first round. If you want a more challenging game, everyone can agree to take less time than three minutes for each round. Instead of using the hourglass, set the timer on your phone or watch to the desired amount of time. Older editions of Scattergories may come with a mechanical timer instead of an hourglass. To operate the mechanical timer, you will need to insert two new AAA batteries into the battery compartment. One difference in using the mechanical timer instead of the hourglass is that the mechanical timer can be set for periods of less than three minutes, while the hourglass cannot. Write down one word for each of the 12 categories in that round. You'll have three minutes to write one answer in the first column of the answer sheet for each of the 12 categories shown on the category cars. All answers must start with the letter rolled on the die at the start of the round. For example, if one of the categories is \u201cA Boy's Name\u201d and the letter you rolled was \u201cP,\u201d then you might choose \u201cPhil\u201d as your answer for that category. The words \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d don't count if they're the first word of an answer.

For example, if you rolled the letter J and one of the categories is \u201cBasketball Player,\u201d then both \u201cJulius Irving\u201d and \u201cMichael Jordan\u201d are appropriate answers. If you are playing as part of a team, be sure to write down any answers you want to suggest instead of saying them out loud. You don't want your opponents to steal your answers! To keep your opponents from seeing the answers you write down, hold up the upper flap of your folder so they won't be able to see your answer sheet.
