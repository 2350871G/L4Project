When you\u2019re finished, write the number down somewhere \u2014 you\u2019ll need it to find the right size piece of plywood for your attic fan to be installed on.

Wiring your attic fan improperly can be dangerous and lead to serious injury. If you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s best to hire a professional electrician to wire your fan after you install it. Installing an Attic Fan on a Roof Turn off the electricity in your attic. Use the main fuse box or circuit breaker box to shut it off. Never try to install an attic fan on your roof with the electricity on. It\u2019s also a good idea to turn any wall switches in the attic to the off position. Drill a pilot hole through the roof where you want your fan to go. That way you\u2019ll be able to tell where to cut out the hole when you climb up on the roof later. The pilot hole should be in the center of where the hole will be. Make sure the hole you\u2019re going to cut out will be centered between 2 rafters so the fan fits. Draw a circle on the roof matching the diameter of your fan. The pilot hole you drilled should be in the center of the circle. Use a tape measure to determine the diameter of your fan, or check the manufacturer's specifications. Then, get on the roof and draw the circle around the pilot hole with a piece of chalk. Wear a hard hat and boots with good traction when you're up on the roof. Ask someone to be there with you when you get on the roof in case you need help for any reason. Don't get on your roof if it's wet or you could slip. Cut out the circle with a reciprocating saw. A reciprocating saw is a handheld power saw with a blade that rapidly goes in and out of a surface. Use the pilot hole you drilled earlier as a starting point for the saw. Follow along the line you drew with the saw until the hole is cut out. Pop the cut-out section of wall or roofing out from the hole and dispose of it. Loosen the shingles surrounding the hole with a pry bar. You need to loosen the shingles so you can slide the attic fan\u2019s flange (the flat rim that extends off the body of the fan) between the shingles and the roof underneath them. If you encounter any nails or staples while you\u2019re loosening the shingles, remove them with the pry bar. Just loosen the 2 corners closest to the hole on each shingle.
