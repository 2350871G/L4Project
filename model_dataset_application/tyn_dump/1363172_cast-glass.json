You can find a hake brush at the local hardware store. It's a small brush with a long flat handle and compact bristles. You need a kiln to put your glass into. The kiln will fuse the glass and turn it into your desired shape. Get a kiln that's big enough to fit your mold into. Generally any type of kiln will do for casting glass.
