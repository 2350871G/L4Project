If they don\u2019t have units available for sale, see if you can rent the unit at a daily or weekly rate instead. A rebar locator looks similar to a stud finder and has a flat side that sits flush against the concrete so you can move it around easily. Rebar locators usually cost around $200 USD when you buy them. Handheld locators usually only detect rebar that\u2019s 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) deep."
