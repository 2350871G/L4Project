  "text":" Using a Grater Peel the potato(es) if desired. You don\u2019t have to peel your potatoes before grating them, and some people even prefer the texture skins add. If you prefer skinless, use a peeler or a paring knife to remove the top layer of skin from the potato(es). Grate the potatoes over a clean plate or countertop. Place your grater over a clean plate or countertop. Most graters have two sides, one for making thick shreds and the other for thinner ones. Choose your preferred side, then hold a potato at one end and press it into the grater as you slide it from the top down. Remove potato shreds when shredding large amounts, if necessary. Many graters are designed in an upside-down V shape. As you grate potatoes, the shredded pieces will fall in the middle of this V, which can create blockages. Clear out shreds as necessary to prevent these blockages. Be careful when you get close to the end of the potato. It\u2019s easy to skin your knuckles while grating, especially if distracted. Grating Potatoes in a Food Processor Put together your food processor. Different brands may have unique features, but for most models, you\u2019ll first need to attach the plastic bowl to the processor\u2019s base. After that, put the grater blade onto the middle part (blade shaft) at the center of the bowl. Always make sure your processor is unplugged when assembling, disassembling, or swapping in a new blade/attachment. Add potatoes to the bowl. Depending on the size of your processor bowl, you may need to cut the potatoes in half before adding them. Most processors have a fill line that indicates the maximum amount of ingredients that should be added to the bowl. Shred the potatoes in the processor. Firmly attach the lid on top of the bowl of the food processor. After that, hold down the \u201cpulse\u201d button at short intervals until the potatoes look grated. This shouldn\u2019t take long, which is one of the bonuses of using a food processor. Shredding with a Mandoline Set up your mandoline. Food cut with a mandoline will fall beneath this kitchen tool, so thoroughly clean the surface below it before shredding potatoes. If your mandoline has foldable legs, extend these and then place it on a cutting board or countertop. Sturdiness is also very important when using a mandoline. A wobbly mandoline will make kitchen accidents more likely. Insert the julienne blade. Each model will have its own procedure for swapping in a new blade. This process, if done incorrectly, can be dangerous. Follow your mandoline\u2019s directions carefully when inserting the julienne blade. The blades on some mandolines will be directly accessible from the underside, while others may have a hinged part that opens to access the blade. Blades are generally grasped by their base, and then pulled out of or pushed into a slot found underneath the mandoline. Some mandolines may have only one blade. To adjust the cut of these, you\u2019ll usually change a plastic attachment on top of the mandoline (sometimes called a runway attachment). Wet the runway. The strings leading down to the blade are referred to as the \u201crunway.\u201d These strings can get gummed up by the stickiness of the starch in potatoes. To make sure the potatoes slide easily down the runway, sprinkle a few drops of water along this part of the mandoline. Insert the potato into the hand guard. Halve the potato(es) with a knife. Put the uncut end of a potato into the hand guard. Place the flat, cut end of the potato at the top of the runway and slide it down the mandoline to shred the potato. Repeat this motion until you\u2019ve finished shredding all your potatoes. The blades of mandolines are very sharp. They can easily cut off the tips of fingers or shave skin from knuckles. Unless you\u2019re a professional, always use a hand guard when using a mandoline. Making Crispy Hash Brown Potatoes Soak shredded potatoes in water. Once your potatoes are shredded, put them in a mixing bowl filled with water. There should be enough water to completely submerge the shredded potatoes. This will remove some of the starch from the potatoes and maintain good color in the browns. Squeeze out the shredded potatoes. Use your clean hands to fish the potatoes out of the water. Squeeze the shreds lightly to remove water from them without destroying their shape. Pile the shreds in the center of a clean dish towel. Wring the towel to remove any remaining moisture from the potatoes. Cook the potatoes at medium-high heat. But first, set the heat to high and coat the skillet\u2019s bottom with butter. When the skillet is coated, turn the heat down to medium-high, and spread the shredded potatoes in the skillet in an even layer. Flip the potatoes to brown them on both sides. Wait until the shredded potatoes are golden brown on the bottom. Lift the potatoes with your spatula periodically to check their progress. When ready, flip the potatoes and cook the other side in the same fashion. Season the hash browns and enjoy. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper onto the hash browns or serve them plain. Hash browns make an excellent side for most breakfast foods, including eggs, pancakes and omelets.",
