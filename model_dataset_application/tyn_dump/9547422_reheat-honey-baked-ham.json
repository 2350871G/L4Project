For best results, only reheat 1 slice of ham at a time. In place of a microwave-safe plate, you could also use a paper plate, glass container, or even a microwave-safe plastic container."

          "description":"Place a paper towel over your ham so that it\u2019s completely covered. Use a spray bottle, or wet your hands and shake them over the paper towel, to dampen it slightly. This will help prevent the ham from drying out as you reheat it. If your microwave-safe plate or container has sides, you can also put in around 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water to stop the ham from drying out. Plastic wrap may also work for this, but increases the chances of melted plastic on your ham. Never use aluminum or tin foil in the microwave."

Repeat this process until the ham is warmed through. The amount of time it takes for the ham to heat through will depend on its thickness. Check the temperature of your ham by touching it, or by tearing off a small chunk and eating it to see if it\u2019s warmed through."

If you added a little water to the plate before microwaving, be careful not to touch it as you remove the ham. Any water left on the plate will likely be very hot."

Any water left on the plate will likely be very hot. Pan-Frying Ham to Reheat Place an oiled frying pan over medium heat. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of any cooking oil, such as vegetable, canola, or olive oil, into a frying pan. Put the pan on your stovetop over medium heat and allow it to warm up. When the pan is at the right temperature, the oil should move freely as you tilt the pan even slightly. Lay the slices of ham in the frying pan.

Once your ham has been given time enough to warm through in the frying pan, use tongs or a fork to lift it out and onto a plate. Serve the ham immediately so that it is still warm when you eat it. Make sure to turn off the heat beneath the frying pan once you take the ham out. Reheating Ham in an Oven Preheat the oven to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) and prepare a baking tray.
