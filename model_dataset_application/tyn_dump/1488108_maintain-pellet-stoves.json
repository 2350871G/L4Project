This is important to prevent chimney fires and smoke leaking from the stove. If your stove is newer, check your service contract. Your supplier can perform maintenance for you."

While your stove will run on lower-grade material, better pellets are more efficient and produce less ash. In the long run, good fuel saves you money since it does less damage to your stove over time. An example of premium fuel is softwood pellets with less than .5% ash in them. When burning pellets, buy a small bag of pellets and try them out before you purchase more. Watch them go through your stove to make sure they don\u2019t crumble and clog it."

          "headline":"Store your pellets properly.",
          "description":"Put your fuel in a location sealed and safe from the elements. Pellets that are exposed to the air and soil absorb water and stick inside your stove. Most pellets are fine when raised off the ground and kept in the manufacturer\u2019s packaging. Cover up any damaged areas on that packaging with waterproof tape or plastic. When your stove is not in use, remove any pellets so they don\u2019t stick to the hopper."

During the heating season, turn off the stove and wait for the glass to cool before cleaning it."

Vinegar on a rag works for steel piping as well, but wipe down black surfaces with a dry cloth when you\u2019re done in order to avoid streaks. For cast iron stoves, use your brush and vacuum."

If there\u2019s a thick, brown substance or pieces of hardened ash called clinkers, remove them before use. Use an ash vacuum to remove loose ash, then use an ash brush to scrape off the hardened ash before it melts.

Repeat this around the rest of the door and the ash pan and hopper doors if your stove has them. If the door becomes too loose or too tight, you\u2019ll need to undo and replace the gaskets before they ruin the door\u2019s seal. To remove the gasket, take off the door and lay it on a soft surface. Pull out the gasket, clean the groove with a wire brush, then replace the gasket with cement.

Loosen the fasteners, take out the old glass, and replace it with new glass. Tighten the fasteners only a little in order to allow the glass space to expand during heating. Stove glass is expensive.
