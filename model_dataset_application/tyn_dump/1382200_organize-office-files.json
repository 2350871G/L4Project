Different kinds of offices will have different kinds of categories, but the general system is the same. You need to figure out a system that sorts your files in a meaningful way. For example, if you work in a law office and need to organize client files, you might sort by general case types: litigation, probate, corporate, administrative, and others."

For example, if you are setting up a filing system for financial matters, you might have a general category of \u201cOutgoing Payments,\u201d and then set up subcategories of vendors, suppliers, services, professionals and administrative costs."

For example, a folder containing records of payments to your vendors would have the label, \u201cOutgoing Payments / Vendors.\u201d\nThe labels on each file should be printed as neatly and consistently as possible. You can very easily buy a software packages that will allow you to format labels, so you can type and print them using your computer.

In most cases, the envelopes are unnecessary and can be discarded. However, if you believe you may need proof of delivery or proof of a postmark, then you should staple the envelope to the papers and keep them together. Multiple papers should be stapled together. This will prevent things from getting separated or lost. Staples are preferable to paper clips because (a) they fit more uniformly in the files and (b) they do not have the problem of slipping off."
