          "description":"Since plasma TVs use more power and generate more heat than LCD TVs, it is best to turn the screen off before cleaning. Let the screen remain off for 15-20 minutes. This will allow ample time for the unit to cool before you clean the screen. Failure to do this may cause your cleaning solution to evaporate before it has had enough time to remove any dust, dirt, or contaminants on your screen."

This should be enough to remove most dirt and dust from your TV screen.
