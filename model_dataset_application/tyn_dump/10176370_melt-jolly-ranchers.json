          "description":"A bowl will work, but depending on where you will be pouring the melted candy, a coffee cup will pour a little cleaner. If you are microwaving more than 4 candies at a time, you will need to increase the cooking time. 4 candies will produce about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid. Be sure whatever it is has a handle because the candy will be quite hot once melted. A glass Pyrex measuring cup works quite well. If heating multiple batches, though, give the glass time to slowly cool between heating."

          "description":"Initially cook them for approximately 1 minute. Microwaves will vary, so you will need to adjust based on your specific model. This should get all four pieces to melt in one go. If the candies do not melt entirely on the first heat, cook them again in 15-second intervals. Then in the second batch, heat for the combined time."

The liquid will begin to harden again within a few minutes, so you will need to work quickly. If it hardens again, simply reheat the candy in 15-second intervals to liquify them again."

Make sure the candies are level with or lower than the lid of the pot so that the liquid will not overflow when it is done cooking. Put the candies in evenly stacked layers to ensure they melt evenly in the pot, depending on how much liquid you need to make. You can expect the liquid to be about half the height of the candies themselves depending on how well they are packed into the pot."

If you heat for too long, it will begin to bubble from the heat. Don\u2019t forget to use oven mitts! Use the liquid immediately after removing it from the heat. Keep the oven on in case the mixture begins to harden again, but you should have a few minutes to work with the liquid before it does. If the liquid re-hardens before you are done, pop it back in the oven for about 2-3 minutes."

In 10-15 minutes, you\u2019ve got a new take on caramel apples. If the liquid isn\u2019t deep enough to dip anymore, you may need to transfer them to a smaller, deeper bowl or pot. Otherwise, you can pour the liquid over the apples, although this can be more messy! Use a stick or skewer to pierce and handle the apples. This makes dipping and eating cleaner and safer. Each apple will need about 12 candies to coat it."

Using either of the melting methods above, you will simply pour the liquid over the molds that have a lollipop stick in them. Once the candy hardens completely, it will have formed around the stick into a lollipop."

Try mixing them into a brewed tea while it is hot. Then once it cools, you will have a fruity iced tea! Cooled drinks will take a little longer for the candies to mix with. Consider heating the drink before mixing in the candy liquid if you are in a hurry."
