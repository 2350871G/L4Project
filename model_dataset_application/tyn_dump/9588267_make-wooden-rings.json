It should be just slightly narrower than your finger. The pointed tip of the drill bit will mark the placement of the finger hole, while the angled corners bore out the outer edges of the ring.

If you take the manual approach, start with a medium-grit sandpaper (around 80 grit) and follow it up with a few passes with a high-grit one (100-120 grit) to get the most seamless texture.

Rotate the wood gradually to ensure that the band turns out as even and symmetrical as possible. Continue sanding down the blank little by little, using the circular outline as a guide. Be careful not to bear down too hard\u2014remember, you can always sand off more if needed, but you can\u2019t put it back on. At this stage, you can use your saw to shave some of the excess width off of especially thick blanks to reduce them to a more practical size. If there's enough extra material, you might even have enough left over to create a pair of matching rings. Work carefully and be patient. Shaping is the most time-consuming part of the process, and it may take a little while for you to end up with a ring you\u2019re happy with."

Rotate the ring until you\u2019ve sanded down the entire circumference, then turn it over and smooth the opposite side. Once again, be careful not to remove too much wood from the edges of the ring. Doing your sanding by hand will offer you greater control over how much material you\u2019re taking off if you\u2019re concerned about damaging the ring after all the hard work you\u2019ve put into it.

Once it\u2019s been treated, you\u2019ll be able to wear it fearlessly in virtually any set of conditions.
