  "text":" Using a Sharpening Rod Purchase a serrated knife sharpening tool. Serrated knives need different sharpeners than straight-edged blades. Most serrated knife sharpeners are rod-shaped, usually with a taper to accommodate different sized serrations. Locate the side of your knife with a beveled edge. Serrated knives generally do not look the same from both sides. On one side, the face of the blade will continue at the same angle until the blade's edge.
