If you are following a specific recipe, add your seasonings now. Don\u2019t forget salt and pepper! Oil and season your chicken. Rub cooking oil such as olive oil on the chicken to get a crispier outside texture. Add seasonings like thyme, oregano, lemon, garlic, or any other herb or seasoning to add some pizzazz to your poultry. You can also use a store bought rub like Cajun or spicy chili rub. To most thoroughly coat the chicken, pour the oil and seasonings into a plastic, sealable bag. Put the chicken inside, seal the bag, and shake. Marinate your chicken. Pour your marinade into a bowl and let the chicken soak in the marinade for two to eight hours. Make sure to keep the chicken and marinade in the fridge while it soaks. Leaving it for eight hours or more will ensure the most flavorful results. Brine your chicken. Brine gives chicken an extra salty flavor and can be combined with many different seasonings. Mix coarse salt into warm water and add your desired seasonings. Some people also add sugar to their brine. Let the chicken soak in the brine for two to eight hours (keep it in the fridge while it is soaking.)"
