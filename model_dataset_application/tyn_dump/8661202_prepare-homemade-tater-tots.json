Form the paste into cylindrical tots. Scoop the mixture out onto a clean cutting board or counter. Pick up small scoops of the mixture and use your hands to shape it into cylindrical tots that are a little shorter than the length of your thumb. Frying the Tots on the Stovetop Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Place a large stockpot on the stove over medium heat. Pour in the vegetable oil and wait a minute or so for it to heat. Place the tots in the skillet. Drop the tots individually into the skillet, placing them about 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart. If the skillet isn't large enough to fit all the tots, fry them in batches so that the skillet doesn't get overcrowded. Flip the tots over at about 2 minutes. After the tots have fried for about 2 minutes, use a spatula to flip the tots over to the other side so that they cook evenly. The tots should be getting golden and start to look crispy.

Baking the Tots in the Oven Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218.33 C). Begin baking your tater tots by preheating the oven to 425 degrees F (218.33 C). If you want extra crispy tots, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232.22 C). Spread the tots on a baking tray. Cover the baking tray with parchment paper, then place the tots on top. Parchment paper will make cleanup easier than baking the tots directly on top of the baking tray. Toss the tots in olive oil. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) on the tots, then toss them to lightly coat them in the oil. Then arrange the tots so that they are about one inch (2.54 cm) apart to ensure that they don't stick together. Bake the tots for 15 minutes and flip. Place the tots in the preheated oven and cook for about 15 minutes. Then use a spatula to flip the tots onto their other side and place them back in the oven. Bake the tots for 15 more minutes and serve. Keep the tots in the oven for another 15 minutes, then take them out and transfer them to a plate or serving platter. Garnish them with parsley if you wish, then serve them alongside your favorite dipping sauces.",
