Switch off all suspect breakers and use a suitable meter or tester to ensure that power is off - reducing the chance of shock or burns. Locate the knock out stamping (KO) sized to fit the desired connector (or fitting). There will likely be several KOs of different sizes on more than one surface from which to choose. Pick the one that will be easiest to connect the cable or pipe. Find the point of attachment for this KO. The single size KOs and smallest of multiple KOs are generally secured in a single location. Press the edge of a screwdriver against the inner-most KO's stamped edge, away from this point of attachment, and press (or rap sharply if needed) to push the KO away from the wall of the box. Twist the KO back and forth with fingers or pliers to fully remove. The smallest KO is usually a 3/8\" or 1/2\" trade size opening. Most modern connectors require a minimum 1/2\" trade size opening. If this is the size of the KO removed and the connector to be installed, skip head to step 10; otherwise continue to increase to the next step KO size. Locate the next KO ring point of attachment. The second ring of KO is much smaller and may be attached to yet a third (or more) KO ring. These KO rings are also often secured by two (or more) points of attachment.

Excessive force could damage any additional KO ring - rendering the opening too large to support the connector. Continue removing KO rings until the correct size opening is achieved.  Remove the locknut from the connector.  Insert the connector into the opening from the outside of the box.  Spin the locknut onto the connector.
