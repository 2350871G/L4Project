This is the standard way to determine how wide the curtains need to be if you want them to sit inside the window recess and only cover the window. However, if you want the curtains to be wider and sit outside of the window recess, just measure from where you want 1 side to be to where you want the other side to be."

This is how wide the curtains need to be to give them a gathered pleated look and make it more difficult to see through the window from the outside. Note that if you are using more than 1 curtain panel, then they need to add up to twice the length. For instance, if you want to use 2 curtain panels for 1 window, then each curtain panel needs to be the width of the window so that the total adds up to twice the width of the window. If you want to create more privacy you can increase the width of the curtains to 2.5 or 3 times the width of the window. Keep in mind that if they are any wider than 3 times the width of the window, the blinds will look very bunched together and crowded."
