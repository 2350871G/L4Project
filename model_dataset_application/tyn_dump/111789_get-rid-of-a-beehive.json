    "Do not leave sections of a hive within the structure of your home.",
    "Even if you seal it off so bees can\u2019t get back in, the hive will rot and smell bad.",
    "Also, the wax will eventually melt and can damage the wiring or structure of your home.",
    "Seal off the area so a new hive can\u2019t be built there.",
    "If you leave the area open, future swarms of bees may build beehives in the same spot.",
    "If the hive was in a tree trunk, for instance, use expanding spray foam, caulk, or even concrete to block off the opening.",
    "If the hive was against your home, garage, or other structure, patch up any damage and seal any openings in the area.",
    "Hire a professional to repair the structure if you\u2019re not capable of doing it yourself.",
    "Unfortunately, large beehives can cause major structural damage to homes.",
    "That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to deal with a beehive that\u2019s against your home as soon as you notice it."
