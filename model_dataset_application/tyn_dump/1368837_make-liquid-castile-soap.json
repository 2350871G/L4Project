While traditional castile soap only uses olive oil, you can use additional vegetable oils in place of some of the olive oil as well. For example, you can replace 16 fluid ounces (470 mL)  of the olive oil with 16 ounces (450 g) of coconut oil for an extra hydrating and cleaning liquid soap. You can also replace some of the olive oil with hemp oil or jojoba oil to help fight skin inflammation and redness. Just make sure that the amount of oil used still adds up to 40 fluid ounces (1,200 mL)."

Direct contact to potassium hydroxide lye flakes, and even exposure due to lack of ventilation, can burn your skin and even cause blindness if it gets in your eyes."

Then, measure out 9 ounces (260 g) of potassium hydroxide lye flakes and add them carefully to the distilled water. Use a silicone spatula to mix the lye solution, stirring slowly and carefully until the flakes are completely dissolved. You can buy potassium hydroxide lye flakes online and at some apothecary stores. Using distilled water is necessary because the pH and mineral content of tap water varies from one place to another. This can greatly impact the chemical reactions during the soap-making process, as well as its purity and cleaning ability. If you want the castile soap to be even more moisturizing, you can add 8 ounces (230 g) of glycerin to the lye solution."

Cover the slow cooker with the lid, returning to stir the mixture every 30 minutes with a silicone spatula. This will ensure that the soap ingredients don\u2019t separate as they cook in the slow cooker. As the soap cooks, it will become increasingly more translucent.
