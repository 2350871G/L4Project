          "description":"This will help the steak cook more evenly and prevents the meat from seizing, which makes it tougher. Place the steak on the kitchen counter, for instance, to let it warm up before you bake it. This is especially important for thicker cuts of meat, so the center doesn\u2019t end up undercooked while the edges are overcooked. Don\u2019t let the steak sit out for more than 2 hours or it will go bad. How to Choose a Steak\nIf you're on a budget, pick a cheaper cut, like tri-tips, top blade, or bottom sirloin. If you're looking for the most flavor, opt for a steak that's on the bone. Bone-in meat tends to be more flavorful and juicy. For that perfect steakhouse taste, choose a strip, rib eye, porterhouse or T-bone steak. These are the most popular among chefs. For the best quality, buy your meat from a butcher or the butcher's section of the grocery store. Avoid pre-packaged or frozen steak."

Unlike the traditional bake setting, which requires a specific temperature, broilers only have 2 options: on or off. Turn yours on and let it preheat while you prepare the steak. An oven will heat much faster on the broil setting. It typically only takes about 5 to 10 minutes. In most ovens, the broiler is in the main compartment. However, in older gas ovens, there may be a separate broiler drawer. Check the oven manual if you aren\u2019t sure where yours is or how to use it."

If you aren\u2019t sure if your pan can go in the oven, check the bottom to see if it says \u201coven-safe\u201d or \u201csafe for oven use.\u201d\nYou can also preheat your pan on the stove.

Get creative with your rub! Mix in garlic powder, paprika, thyme, or seasoned salt, for example. You can use any type of oil, like olive or vegetable oil, depending on your preferences or what you have in the pantry. Always wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching raw meat. Steak Rub Options\nFor a citrus flavor, combine grated lemon peel, rosemary, and salt. If you're craving Mexican food, try dried ancho pepper, chili powder, cilantro, and a touch of lime. If you like the combo of sweet and salty, add brown sugar to salt and black pepper. For Montreal steak seasoning, rub in garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, coriander, dill, and red pepper flakes."

    "Cooking Steak in Foil Packs Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C).",
    "This typically takes about 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "Turn the oven on while you make the foil packs so it\u2019s at the right temperature when you\u2019re ready to place the steak inside.",
    "To preheat the oven faster, turn on the broiler first.",
    "Then switch it to the bake setting before you use it.",
    "Lay out two 12 by 12 in (30 by 30 cm) sheets of aluminum foil.",
    "Tear off your sheets and place them side by side on a flat surface.",
    "Smooth out any wrinkles with the palm of your hand so they\u2019re completely flat.",
    "If you want to divide the steak into more than 2 servings, use smaller pieces of aluminum foil.",
    "For example, rip off 4 6 by 6 in (15 by 15 cm) sheets.",
    "For extra protection, you can place the aluminum foil on a cutting board.",
    "If any stray pieces of steak or juice comes off the foil, it won\u2019t contaminate the counter.",
    "Cut the steak into even strips that are at least 2 in (5.1 cm) thick.",
    "This will give you steak that\u2019s cooked medium-well.",
    "If you cut strips that are thinner than 2 inches (5.1 cm), the steak will likely be dry and overcooked.",
    "Use a sharp knife to slice the 1 lb (0.45 kg) top sirloin steak on a cutting board, making sure the strips are all approximately the same thickness.",
    "The thicker the strips are, the more rare your steak will be.",
    "Don't cut pieces thicker than 4 inches (10 cm).",
    "Otherwise, your steak will be undercooked.",
    "Skirt, hanger, or flank steak cuts work best for these packets.",
    "They're tender, easy to cut, and soak up marinade well.",
    "If you don't want to spend a lot of money, pick a cheaper cut like tri-tips, bottom sirloin, or top blade.",
    "Place half of the steak strips in the center of each foil sheet.",
    "Grouping the meat as close to the center of the foil will make it easier to close up the packs.",
    "Keep the amounts on each sheet even so one pack isn\u2019t much larger than the other.",
    "If you used more than 2 sheets of foil, divide up your steak accordingly.",
    "Wash your hands with soap and warm water after handling the raw meat so you don\u2019t spread bacteria.",
    "Season the steak with the olive oil, salt, and pepper.",
    "Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil over both piles of meat, then sprinkle salt and pepper on top.",
    "Add as much seasoning as you\u2019d like.",
    "Feel free to add other spices and herbs, like dried rosemary, garlic salt, or curry powder, for extra flavor.",
    "You can also chop up veggies or potatoes to cook with the steak in the packs.",
    "Substitute any type of oil for the olive oil if you prefer a different taste.",
    "Seal the aluminum foil around the steak, forming a pack.",
    "Gather the edges of the foil sheet and squeeze them together in the center, wrapping up the steak.",
    "Try to avoid leaving any gaps where moisture could escape.",
    "The tighter you seal the packs, the juicier the meat will be.",
    "If you rip the foil, transfer the steak to a new sheet and wrap it again.",
    "Place the packs in the oven to cook for 30 minutes.",
    "Set the packs directly on the oven rack, making sure the side with the sealed edges is facing up.",
    "The best spot is the center rack, which is where the hot air circulates best and cooks your meat more evenly.",
    "To avoid a mess, you can place the packs on a baking sheet to catch any juice that may leak out of the foil.",
    "Use your phone\u2019s clock app or a kitchen timer so you don\u2019t forget to take the packs out after 30 minutes.",
    "Remove the packs from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes.",
    "When steak cooks, the moisture spreads to the outside of the meat.",
    "Letting it rest before you eat it allows the steak to soak back up the juices so it\u2019s not dry.",
    "Store any leftover steak in an airtight container in the refrigerator for no more than 4 days.",
    "How to Use Leftover Steak\nCut the steak into strips for fajitas or tacos.",
    "Slice it thinly to use on sandwiches, like a Philly cheesesteak.",
    "Toss strips of steak with green salad for a filling lunch.",
    "Dice it up to add to soups or stews.",
    "Serve steak with eggs for a hearty breakfast."
