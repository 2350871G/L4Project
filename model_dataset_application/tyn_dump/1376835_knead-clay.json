      "headline":"Press the clay.",
      "description":"Throw the clay down forcefully onto the kneading surface. Bear down on the clay using the weight of your upper body. Do not flatten the clay completely. Push the clay down about halfway to the kneading surface. Draw the clay towards you. Pull the clay up into a pile. Push down on the clay until you have flattened it halfway. Ensure that you do not press the clay past the middle section of the lump. Flattening the clay completely may result in air bubbles being trapped in the clay. Continue to draw and press the clay ten times more."

      "description":"Slap one cut half of clay forcefully on top of the other. Press the top half of clay into the bottom half. Ensure that you do not leave space where air may get caught between the two halves. Arrange the halves so that their cut edges are both facing out to the left or right side when pressed together. Aligning the halves of clay will help free the clay of air bubbles. Cutting the clay and rearranging the layers ensures that all parts of the clay mix together evenly."
