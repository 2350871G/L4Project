Start by combining it with liquid ingredients first like eggs and oil, then mix in the dry ingredients like flour and baking soda.

    "Cover it with a damp tea towel to trap heat and moisture, expediting the rate it will rise.",
    "Place the bowl in a warm area to speed up the rise even more.",
    "Poke the bread with your finger to test if it\u2019s ready for baking.",
    "The indentation should bounce back about half way.",
    "If it fully bounces back, it needs more proofing time.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t bounce back at all, it\u2019s been over-proofed.",
    "If this happens, mash all the air out of it and let it proof again until it rises an inch below the rim of the bowl.",
    "This is a good time to preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
    "Divide the dough into two pieces and place them into oiled pans.",
    "Split the dough into two pieces with your hands and roll each piece into a cylindrical shape.",
    "Try to make each piece even so they\u2019ll have a similar baking time.",
    "Lightly oil each loaf pan and place each cylinder of dough into the center of each one.",
    "Let the dough sit in the pans until each chunk of dough has risen to the rims.",
    "Insert the pans into the hot oven and set a timer for 40 minutes.",
    "Place the loaf pans on the top oven rack if you want the bread to have a toasted top.",
    "Using the bottom rack will cause the bottom of the loaf to brown more.",
    "The bread is done baking when the top is dry, firm, and has taken on a deep golden brown color.",
    "Rotate the loaves at the 20 minute mark to ensure even baking.",
    "To test for doneness, take the bread out of the oven after 40 minutes and insert an instant-read thermometer into the center.",
    "A temperature of 190\u00b0F (87\u00b0C) is a good sign that the bread is finished baking.",
    "You can also insert a skewer into the center of each loaf to test for doneness.",
    "A clean skewer means the bread is fully baked.",
    "Use oven mitts to transfer each loaf to a cooling rack for 1 hour.",
    "A cooling rack will keep air circulating around the loaf and prevent the crust from getting soggy.",
    "Slowly flip each tin over onto the rack to remove each loaf.",
    "If some parts stick to the pan, use a fork or spoon to carefully wedge the loaf out of the tin and onto the rack.",
    "Let each loaf cool for 1 hour or longer before slicing them with a serrated knife.",
    "Check each loaf again for doneness by tapping on the bottom with your fingers.",
    "A hollow sound indicates the bread is fully baked while a dull, dense sound means it needs to go back into the oven.",
    "Store baked bread at room temperature in a brown paper bag.",
    "Don\u2019t put it in the refrigerator as doing so causes the starches to crystallize, resulting in stale bread.",
    "Cooking with Nutritional Yeast Substitute cheese with nutritional yeast in various dishes.",
    "Many vegans add nutritional yeast to a variety of dishes to mimic the flavor of cheddar cheese.",
    "Sprinkle it over popcorn, salads, stir-fries, rice bowls, pastas, soups, and tofu dishes to amp up the flavor of your meal.",
    "Make vegan cashew queso by blending it with soaked cashews, salsa, turmeric, salt, and any other additions you like in your dip.",
    "Thicken soups and sauces with nutritional yeast.",
    "The small flakes soak up moisture, thickening soups and sauces without the added calories of cream, flour, or other starches.",
    "Note that it will affect the flavor of the soup or sauce, giving it a nutty, cheesy taste.",
    "Add 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) to gravies, mac and cheese, creamy salad dressings, and mashed potatoes in place of starch thickeners.",
    "Use nutritional yeast as a source of B-12.",
    "Fortified nutritional yeast contains vitamin B-12, a necessary nutrient that\u2019s hard to get on a plant-based diet.",
    "Just note that the yeast must read \u201cfortified\u201d on the label because unfortified nutritional yeast won\u2019t have B-12.",
    "A little less than 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) provides the recommended daily amount of B-12.",
    "If you purchase nutritional yeast from bulk bins at the grocery store, check with the manager or one of the employees to make sure it\u2019s fortified.",
    "Store nutritional yeast is a dry airtight container.",
    "Any moisture can cause the nutritional yeast to grow mold or bacteria, so make sure it\u2019s protected in a glass or plastic container.",
    "You can store it in the refrigerator or in the pantry for up to 2 years (although it\u2019s best to use it within a month for maximum flavor).",
    "If the nutritional yeast tastes bitter or malty, throw it away.",
    "Contact with water can cause mold and other bacteria to grow"
