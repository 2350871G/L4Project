Warm-season grasses will be able to survive a brutal summer and tend to do well in the southern states. Choose from varieties such as Bermuda, St. Augustine, and Kikuyu. Cool-season grasses handle cold much better than warm-season grasses. They can tolerate freezing temperatures and some drought. Don't expect them to survive the heat or go longer than 4 weeks without water. Kentucky bluegrass is a popular cool-season grass."

Soil testing will give you an idea of how much fertilizer to use, and what kind. You can pick up a soil test at any big box store or garden center. The test will tell you whether your soil is deficient in any specific nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorus, or magnesium. If it is, you can use a fertilizer that has more of that nutrient to replenish it. Otherwise, choose an all-purpose 10-10-10 fertilizer for your lawn. It is difficult to amend soil in an established lawn. If you need to add fertilizer work it into the first 4-6 inches."

Your goal is a soil that is loose, rich in organic matter, and able to hold moisture while draining well. Clear the area of all weeds, rocks, and roots. Using a shovel dig up any large objects in the area where you'll be planting grass. Make sure you get rid of all weed roots. You may have to use a chemical weed killer to get rid of weeds completely. If you must use chemicals, refer to the manufacturer for instructions on how much to use. Till your soil either by hand or using a rototiller depending on the size of the area. This is the perfect opportunity to mix any compost or other amendments to your soil. Add gypsum to your soil to improve drainage."

It may also protect them from birds and limit their movement in the event of heavy rain. You can also spread your top-dressing by tossing it lightly over the seeded area with a shovel.

For best results, water your seeds 2-3 times a day for about 5-10 minutes for the first 8-10 days. During this period it is critical that your seeds stay moist. Water in the morning to decrease the chances of evaporation. However, avoid watering your lawn so much that it's soggy all the time, because grass doesn't like wet roots. Don't use a strong spray when watering a newly seeded lawn. You run the risk of drowning your seeds or washing them away. When watering your lawn, be aware of any potential rainfall in your area. Take the amount of rain into consideration when watering and aim for about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water a week. If you live in an area prone to heavy rainfall, you could lose some seed. However, the rain must be heavy enough to move the soil before it can move the seed."

The roots hold the strips together allowing you to put long strips onto your prepared soil. Sod is typically sold on heavy wooden pallets, ranging in size from 450-700 sq. ft (42-65 sq. m). These pallets are difficult to transport, so you may wish to ask your supplier about delivery services and fees. You will probably need to pay a return deposit on your sod. You can plant sod in almost any season, but if you plan on laying sod in the summer, make sure you give it plenty of water."

Don't walk on the sod while you're laying it and if you do happen to step on it, smooth out the footprints with a rake. Trim any excess sod off with a sharp knife and save it for odd corners. Make sure the sod is smooth as you lay it. You want it flat against the soil so the roots will take."
