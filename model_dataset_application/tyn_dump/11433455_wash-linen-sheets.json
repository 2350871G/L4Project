For a gentler touch, pass on the commercial stain removers and instead use a solution made from cold water and about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) mild liquid detergent. If you decide to use a commercial stain remover, check to make sure that it doesn't contain bleach or ammonia. Chemical oxidizers and natural fabrics are a bad mix."
