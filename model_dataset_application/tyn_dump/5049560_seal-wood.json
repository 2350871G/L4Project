          "headline":"Sand the wood until it is very smooth.",
          "description":"Sand the entire surface with a hand sander or an electric sander to get rid of rough areas and imperfections. If your wood is pretty rough to start with, begin sanding with a rough sandpaper with a grit of 100 or 120. Progress from rougher grit to finer grit sandpapers, which allows you to reduce major irregularities before achieving a fine finish. To get a very smooth surface you should end with 400 grit sandpaper. Even if your wood already feels pretty smooth, take the time to run 400-grit sandpaper over it before sealing it. This will ensure that the surface is completely smooth once the sealant is applied. Sand with the grain, which means that you need to follow the lines of the wood grain straight back and forth. This will help you avoid leaving behind swirly marks on the surface.Warning: Wear a dust mask while you are sanding to avoid inhaling wood particles."

          "description":"Wipe the entire surface several times. This will help you avoid getting wood particles stuck in your sealant, which will create an imperfect surface. A tac cloth is a special sticky cloth that is specially made to remove the dust from the surface of wood after sanding. Tac cloth will remove even fine particles that resist removal from a cloth. Avoid using water on unsealed wood, because it can alter the wood's grain and create roughness."

          "description":"Apply the stain before you apply your sealant so that it is able to soak into the surface. There are a variety of colors and types of stains available but most are applied with rags. First you will wipe your stain on the wood and then let it set for a specific amount of time, which is stated on the stain packaging. Then you will wipe off the excess with a clean, dry rag. The container of your stain will tell you how long you need to wait after applying stain to apply a sealer. Wood stains are available at all hardware and home improvement stores."

They are a quick-finish option if you have a large surface and not a lot of time to seal it. For example, many people use this type of combo product with sealing a deck, due to the large surface area that needs to be treated. They are available at all hardware and home improvement stores. These products can typically be applied with a brush or a roller."

          "description":"There are different types of polyurethane, including oil-based, water-based, and other synthetic mixes. Each type has different characteristics, so think about where your wood is located and how it will be treated in the future to pick the right product. For example, oil-based poly will stand up better to the elements outdoors but it takes much longer to dry and cure than water-based products. Water-based poly won't last quite as long outdoors but can be washed out of tools easily. When picking out a product, you also need to decide between a glossy and matte finished surface.Tip: Polyurethane is a great product for waterproofing wood. It is easy to apply, lasts for a long time, and gives a beautiful finish. However, it will create a glossy or matte sheen finish, changing the look of the wood."

Either brush the polyurethane onto the surface of the wood or soak a clean rag with polyurethane and then smooth it around the face of the wood. Polyurethane is self-leveling because it is thin enough to spread out on its own. This means that you should not have to worry too much about achieving an even coat. Make sure to use extra polyurethane for the end grain because this is the most absorbent part of the wood. The end grain is the exposed, cut part of wood on the end of the piece."

Wear gloves during this entire procedure to avoid staining your hands."

Sand between coats to smooth out any uneven areas. Keep an eye out for any polyurethane drips, and smooth them out with your brush or rag to avoid a bumpy finish. Drying time varies, so make sure you read your polyurethane's instructions and keep an eye on the ambient temperature and humidity as well."

Start at one end of the wood face and work across quickly, making sure that the shellac doesn't dry as you apply the bands. Work quickly across each face of the wood, one band at a time.
