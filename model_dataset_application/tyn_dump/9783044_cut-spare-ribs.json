Also, you should wash your hands when you are switching between handling raw meat and any other type of food. Proper hand washing technique includes using antibacterial soap, lathering the soap on the palms and back of the hands as well as under finger nails and between fingers for at least 20 seconds.

A straight edge knife is smooth on the cutting side as opposed to a serrated edge that would have large grooves. A granton edge has a row of identical scallops on each side of the cutting edge. Set out a cutting board. You may choose either a wood board or non-porous material like plastic. While plastic is easier to clean, both options are safe to use for cutting raw meat. Thaw the meat in 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes per 1 lb (0.45 kg). Place the ribs in a sealable plastic bag and then into a sink filled with the cold water.
