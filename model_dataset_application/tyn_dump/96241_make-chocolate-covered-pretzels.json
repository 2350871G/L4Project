You fill the bottom pan with water and bring it to a simmer, which gently warms and melts the chocolate in the pan nestled on top. This works best for melting chocolate because chocolate can burn easily. Melting it slowly and carefully is key. You can fashion your own double boiler by following the instructions here. If you would rather melt your chocolate in the microwave, you certainly can. Place your melting chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl. Set the timer for one minute, and set the heat to 50% power. After one minute of heating, remove the bowl and stir your chocolate. If it needs to melt more, put it in for 15-second intervals."

However, you can certainly use your hands, a fork, or another utensil if you don\u2019t have tongs. You can eliminate the need for tongs if you use pretzel sticks.

Make sure to do this step slowly and carefully to ensure you do not burn yourself on the hot chocolate. You aren't limited to using standard pretzels. You can play around with the large pretzel rods, small pretzel sticks, twisted pretzels, chunks, and more."

Once you\u2019re sure that the chocolate has completely hardened, you can serve them however you like! Put them on platters to serve at parties, give them out in clear little bags as party favors, or just eat them straight from the tray \u2013 they\u2019re just that good! Store your leftovers in an airtight container in a cool place. Do not place them in a refrigerator, as the chocolate will \"sweat\" when they are brought to room temperature. The chocolate will actually seal the pretzel and keep it fresh longer, so they will last for a couple of weeks."
