They prefer a temperature range of 12\u00b0-30\u00b0 C (53\u00b0-86\u00b0 F). The annual rainfall should be in the range of 850-1200 millimeters (33-47 inches). In terms of altitude, they can handle anything between 360 and 1350 meters (1181-4429 feet), but prefer moderate altitudes of between 600 and 1050 meters (1968-3444 feet)."

Sandalwood prefers red ferruginous loam. Sandalwood can also be planted in sandy soils, red clay soils, and vertisols. Vertisol is a type of clay-rich black soil that contracts dramatically in dry weather, creating deep mud-cracks. The soil pH should be between 6.0 and 7.5. Sandalwood tolerates rocky ground and gravelly soil."

The sandalwood tree connects its root system to that of the host tree in order to get the nutrients it needs. Ideally, you should plant your sandalwood next to an already-established host species, such as long-lived wattles (acacia trees) or casuarinas (a genus of tropical evergreens, including ironwoods and sheoaks). If you need to plant a host species, space them between the sandalwood trees at intervals of 1.6-2 meters (5.2-6.5 feet). Cajanus cajan (pigeon pea) is another good host species for sandalwood trees."
