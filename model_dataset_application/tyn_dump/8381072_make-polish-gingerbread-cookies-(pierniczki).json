The mixture should become thick and pale. Since the pierniczki cookies don't have butter or oil, the cookies get their texture from the beaten egg mixture. This is why it's important to whisk the eggs and sugar for the full 5 minutes."

If you lift up the whisk, the mixture should fall like a ribbon back into the mixing bowl. This means that the ingredients are well mixed.

Re-roll and cut out the remaining dough and other disks of dough. Traditionally, Polish gingerbread cookies are cut in heart shapes.
