The more time the paint has to dry, the less likely you are to remove it. If the paint has already dried or you are tackling an old stain, scrape off as much as possible before you attempt to clean it with water or another liquid agent. If your clothing has many layers of dried paint, you can use tape to remove many of them. Apply a strong tape like heavy duty duct tape, gaffer\u2019s tape or auto repair tape to the surface of the stain, then quickly remove the tape. It should bring the dried paint with it!
