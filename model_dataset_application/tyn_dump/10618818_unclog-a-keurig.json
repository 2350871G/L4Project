Avoid burns by giving it plenty of time to cool off. You will have to tip the machine over to drain some of the water, so play it safe by letting the Keurig rest."

The needle pierces the K-Cups during the coffee-making process, so it will always be accessible in the top part of the Keurig. You can\u2019t harm the machine by cleaning out these holes.

Then, dump the vinegar water out in the sink and put the mug back on the drip tray. Continue running the machine until it uses up all of the vinegar water in the reservoir. If your Keurig does not run without a K-Cup inside it, put a used K-Cup in the coffee pod holder. This causes a little bit of coffee or tea to run through the machine, but it doesn\u2019t prevent the vinegar from clearing out the lines. The vinegar smell gets a bit overwhelming, but it is a safe and natural way to flush out calcium scales.

  "text":" Washing the Detachable Components Unplug the Keurig from the wall outlet. To fully clean the Keurig, you need to access some of the parts involved in carrying water and coffee grounds through the machine. There are some electrical components around these parts. Always pull the power cord out of the wall before opening up the machine. Wait 30 minutes for the water inside the Keurig to cool. The water inside the machine may be hot, especially if you made coffee recently. As long as the machine has no power running to it, the water will begin to cool.

When you reinstall the coffee pod holder, notice the tab slots inside the Keurig. Align the tabs on the funnel with the slots to easily slide it into position. Clearing Sediment Clogs Manually Clear out the holes in the coffee pod holder with a paperclip. Straighten out 1 end of a paperclip to use as a cleaning tool.
