Use a food scale or count the threads to measure out the saffron. Adding too much saffron can ruin a dish, so it's best to err on the side of too little. You can always add more if the taste and color isn't to your satisfaction. Counting the saffron threads usually offers the most accurate measurement.

          "description":"For saffron to really shine in your dish, you need to ensure that its flavor and color are released. The quickest way to do that is to break down the threads. Saffron threads are very delicate, so it's easy to crush them with your hand. Use your thumb and forefinger to gently grind the threads into pieces. However, if you prefer a more uniform look to the pieces of saffron in your recipe, use a mortar and pestle to crush the threads. Crushing saffron for use in recipes typically works best if you're making a recipe that already has water or another cooking liquid in it, such as risotto or paella. Keep in mind that crushing saffron by hand or with a mortar and pestle doesn't offer the most attractive appearance because the threads are no longer in tact. However, you can still get a strong flavor, aroma, and color from crushed saffron."

That way, there's enough time for its flavor to infuse the other ingredients and its color to deepen the recipe. Make sure that there's already some type of liquid in your pot or pan before mixing in the crushed saffron threads."

          "description":"The most effective way to draw the flavor and color out of saffron is to submerge them in a hot liquid, so you want to soak them thoroughly before adding them to your recipe. In most cases, letting it sit in the liquid for 10 to 20 minutes is enough to prepare the saffron. Soaking the saffron before adding it to your recipe is the best way to ensure that it's distributed evenly throughout the dish. You can usually tell that your saffron has soaked long enough when the liquid starts to give off a strong aroma. You can crush the threads by hand or with a mortar and pestle before soaking them, but using the whole strands can add an attractive look to your dish. If you really want a robust flavor and color from your saffron, try soak the threads in room temperature water overnight. Then you can add them to warm chicken stock, milk, wine, or another liquid before adding them to your dish."

Instead, add all of the liquid, so you get a deeper, richer flavor that pervades the entire dish. Typically, the best time to add the saffron liquid is near the end of cooking, but follow the instructions in your recipe. You can strain the threads and add only the liquid to your dish if you prefer, but that's usually only necessary if you're making a recipe that should have a clear appearance, such as a jelly. If you plan to leave the threads in your recipe, there's no need to cut or chop them. The intact threads can add texture and visual interest to your dish."

If the threads have a frayed, almost worn appearance, that can also be an indication that the saffron is poor quality."
