Refer to the paint can to find out how long it takes to dry. Generally, latex paint needs to dry for about 4 hours, while oil-based paint may need up to 16 hours to dry fully. Acrylic paint dries in 1-2 hours. High humidity and low temperatures can increase the drying time."

Before you hang your painting or put items on your new \u201cmarble\u201d surface, allow the paint and/or polyurethane time to dry completely. Avoid touching the surface or moving the object during this time. Painting Marble Surfaces Work in a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator. It\u2019s important to have proper ventilation when sanding and painting so the dust and fumes don\u2019t create respiratory issues. Open windows and doors or use a fan to circulate the air. You should also wear a respirator. Lay out a drop cloth and mask areas you don\u2019t want painted. A drop cloth or old blanket will protect the floor from paint spills. You can use painter\u2019s tape to secure the drop cloth and to mask any areas you don\u2019t want painted, such as an electrical outlet or faucet spout. Use 36-grit sandpaper to remove the finish from the marble. Paint won\u2019t stick to marble\u2019s glossy finish, so it\u2019s necessary to give it some texture. Rub 36-grit sandpaper back and forth over the surface you are going to paint to remove all of the finish. Keep sanding until there aren\u2019t any glossy areas left. The marble should look dull and feel a little rough when you are finished. Clean the surface with a damp tack cloth, then let it dry. To remove the dust created by sanding, wipe down the area with a damp tack cloth. Rinse or replace the tack cloth as needed to remove all the dust and debris. Then, use a dry tack cloth to remove excess moisture. Wait until the surface is completely dry before moving on. Prime the marble with an oil-based primer. Be sure to select an oil-based primer, or the paint won\u2019t stick to the surface of the marble. Use a paint brush or roller to thinly coat the entire surface of the area you want to paint. Use long, even strokes in the same direction to prime the marble. Let the primer dry for 6-8 hours. If you don\u2019t let the primer dry fully, you may smear it and have to start the project over. Plan to do this project over several days so that the end result is exactly what you want. Paint the surface using high-gloss oil-based paint. Once the primer is dry, you can cover it in paint. Use a clean paint brush or roller to apply a thin, even layer of high-gloss oil-based paint in the color of your choice. Be sure to paint in the same direction, rather than doing some strokes up-and-down and others back-and-forth. Allow each coat to dry for 16 hours. After applying the first coat of paint, wait 16 hours or more before applying another coat. If you rush the job, the finish may bubble, smear, or become patchy. Apply additional coats as needed. You will definitely want to apply a second coat, and perhaps even a third or fourth, depending on the color you are painting and how it looks after each coat. Use the same method as before to apply additional layers, and remember to let each coat fully dry before moving on. Let the paint cure for 7 days.
