So if you don't like the color, you'll need to get it off. You could sand it off, but that'll take ages. A stripper goes much faster. You simply just rub it on, wait for the paint to bubble, and chip it off. Lots of people skip this stage. If you do, you'll still have a piece, but it won't look as good as you want it to. Take the extra time to make it look perfect by buying paint stripper (and using it). Once stripped, you may need to do some sanding.

It'll also look nice if it pops through, too (if you're only doing one color of paint, that is). To do this, just take a clean rag, dip it in the stain, and rub it in circles. The natural grain of the wood will still show through. And if you're concerned about the circles showing through, they won't through your next coat of paint."

If the furniture already has a stain or a coat of paint on it, sand away most, but not all, of the finish. Letting the old finish show through unevenly will help contribute to the weathered look of the final piece. 80-grit sandpaper is a good place to start. As you're sanding, keep an eye on how much of the original layer will still pop through. Some people like quite a bit creating a more speckled look while others like the undertones to be more of a subtle surprise."

Both will lead to beautiful pieces. Always work in thin, even layers. It'll take longer, but it'll be worth it.
