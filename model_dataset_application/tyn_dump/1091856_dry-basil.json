  "text":" Harvesting and Trimming the Basil Harvest the basil just before it flowers. Basil will flower after all the leaves on one stem are full-grown, but the herb loses some of its flavor after flowering occurs.

Lay the rinsed leaves on a paper towel and gently pat them dry with a second paper towel. Removing excess moisture before drying basil will prevent molding during the drying process. Hanging the Basil to Dry Gather the leaves in bunches. Group the prepped leaves in a bundle and tie them together at their stems with a rubber band or twist tie. Make more than one bundle if you have lots of basil leaves. Hang leaves to dry. Hang your bundles of basil from a hook or wall tack to dry.

If you want to dry the leaves more quickly, you can go ahead and remove the leaves from the stems. Discard the stems along with any leaves that are bruised or broken. Rinse the leaves and pat them dry. Rinse them gently in water, then set them on paper towels and gently pat them dry. Prepare your oven or food dehydrator. Basil leaves dry beautifully in either an oven set to very low heat or a food dehydrator. If you're using the oven, set it to the lowest temperature - 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C) or lower. If you're using a food dehydrator, ready it for operation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spread the leaves on trays in a thin layer. Either spread them on a baking tray or the food dehydrator tray. Make sure none of the leaves overlap. They should be arranged in one thin, even layer. Dry the leaves to the correct moisture content. The leaves should be dried over the course of 24-48 hours until they are no longer moist; they should crumble easily when pinched between your fingers.
