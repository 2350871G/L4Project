Make sure that the circular base is glued snugly over the waist straps and is covering the end of the tail. You can tie the waist straps together to secure the tail when your child wears it. Cutting and Sewing a Tail Shape Fold the fabric in half and mark 12 inches (30 cm) above the crease. Take 1 yard (0.91 m) of fabric and fold it in half horizontally. Use a tape measure (preferably non-mechanical) and mark 12 inches (30 cm) above your starting point on the fold. This indicates the height of your dinosaur tail. Make sure that your measuring tape expands to at least 3 feet (0.91 m). Make a second mark 24 inches (61 cm) down the fabric. Measure 24 inches (61 cm) from your starting point and mark the fabric. This 24 inches (61 cm) distance will serve as the length of your dinosaur tail. Make sure that you have enough fabric for these measurements. Make a third mark 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the second mark. Take your measuring tape and make a dot 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the second mark. This third measurement represents the pointy, bottom end of the tail. Connect the 3 marks with a marker and cut out the tail shape.

Rotary cutters can be found at most craft stores, and provide a more even and exact cut along the edge of your fabric. If you want to make your lines exact, use these measurements to sketch and cut a template out of cardboard beforehand. Trace a plate on fabric twice to create 2 circles for the tail\u2019s base. Place a ceramic plate onto the fabric and cut around it with scissors or a rotary cutter. Repeat this process so that you have 2 circles. The diameter of this circle will be the width of your dinosaur tail. Use folded fabric if you want to cut 2 circles out at once. Measure and cut out 2 pieces of fabric to create the waist straps. Use a measuring tape to mark and cut out 2 strips of fabric. The length should be 12 inches (30 cm), and the width should be 4 inches (10 cm). These strips will help attach the dinosaur to a child\u2019s waist. Adding the Spikes and Waist Straps Sketch a series of triangles onto a piece of felt using a fabric marker. Use a ruler or measuring tape to sketch a row of triangles onto the felt. Make the triangles, which will be the tail spikes, about 2 inches (5.1 cm) tall and 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. Ensure that there\u2019s 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) between each spike. You can make the spikes bigger or smaller, depending on how you want the tail to look at the end. You can also make individual triangular spikes. Arrange the cut spikes on the edge of the tail fabric and pin them in place. Use fabric scissors to cut the spikes out of the felt.

Pin the spikes so that they face inward, as you will be sewing the fabric from the inside out. Use a sewing machine to attach the spikes to the main fabric. Feed the fabric through the machine to stitch the base tail fabric and spikes together.

Fold and pin the waist strap fabric at the ends before sewing the edges together. Crease the fabric along the center so that the short ends are touching, and use a few pins to secure the fabric in this position. Stitch the edges together lengthwise, but leave the shorter end open. Pinch the fabric on the inside of the stitching to pull the straps right side out. You\u2019ll be stitching the shorter, unsewn ends of the waist straps into the base of the tail. Stitch the Velcro rectangles to the straps and attach the waist straps to the tail. Take a small rectangle of Velcro and place it on the sewn end of the waist strap before stitching it into place with a sewing machine. Then, take the unstitched ends of the waist straps and pin them to the inside of the tail. Make sure that the straps are placed perpendicular to the spikes before sewing them into place. Check to see that the strap is long enough to wrap around a child\u2019s waist. Pin the straps onto the tail and sew them into place. You can purchase Velcro at a craft store.

After sewing the edges together, pinch and tug at the inner fabric of the circle to make pull it right side out. Fill the tail with stuffing until it has a firm shape. Take fiber filling and stuff the base of the tail. Use as much fiber as you need to completely fill the dinosaur tail. You can buy fiber filling at a craft store. You may need more than one bag to fully stuff the tail. Use a ladder stitch to close off the base and complete the tail.
