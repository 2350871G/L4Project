If you don\u2019t have gloves, you can also coat your hands with about a \u20442 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of grapeseed oil or another type of cooking oil.You can use grapeseed oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil.

Because of the jackfruit\u2019s size, the best type of knife to use is a Chinese chef\u2019s knife or a knife of similar size. Pour a small dollop of grapeseed oil, or any other type of cooking oil you have on hand, onto your knife, and use your fingers to spread the oil evenly over the knife\u2019s entire surface.Spread the oil on the knife\u2019s surface slowly and carefully, so that you don\u2019t accidentally cut yourself. The oil may make the knife slippery, so be careful. Jackfruit sap can ruin a knife, so don\u2019t use a high-quality knife to cut the fruit open."
