Although you can try having it in a room temperature glass, many people believe the drink loses flavor if it isn\u2019t kept at near-freezing temperatures. Another way to chill a glass is to leave it in the freezer for up to 4 hours. Even a quick 15-minute freeze helps a lot if you don\u2019t have much time to wait."

As you get used to the taste of a Gibson martini, you can alter the ratio to fit your preferences. Try adding up to 0.75 fluid ounces (22 mL) of vermouth to balance out the sweetness and juniper flavoring most brands of gin feature. You can also substitute vodka for gin.

Cocktail onions are a part of the traditional Gibson martini recipe and add a unique sweetness that distinguishes it from regular martinis. Purchase store-bought cocktail onions if you don\u2019t have time to make your own. They are available online and at many restaurant supply stores. You can substitute manzanilla olives for cocktail onions or go without them, but your drink will taste like a regular martini instead of a Gibson martini.
