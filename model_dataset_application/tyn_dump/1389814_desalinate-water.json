If you happen to live near an ocean, you can skip these materials and fill a bottle with seawater. Seawater is full of salt and great for use in the desalination process."

You should taste pure, clean fresh water that has been desalinated. This desalination device works by using the sun to warm up the salt water. The plastic wrap helps to trap the water vapors in the bowl as the salt water evaporates. Because the top of the plastic wrap is much cooler than the rest of the bowl, the humid air in the bowl condenses on the top of the plastic wrap and forms water droplets. Over time, the water droplets on the plastic wrap grow larger and start to flow to the center of the bowl due to the weight of the rock. As the water droplets build up, they grow heavier and eventually fall into the cup. The result of this simple desalination device is a cup of fresh drinking water that does not contain any salt."
