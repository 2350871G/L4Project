Squeeze the snow together to start compacting the snow into a snowball. Don't make your snowballs too large, they can be hard to throw accurately. Wear gloves instead of mittens to allow you to more accurately form the snowball. Try using your bare hands, allowing your body heat to help form the snowball."

Strive for the right uniformity in your snow, not too wet and not too dry. Using too much water will melt your snowball. Add only enough water to help hold it together.
