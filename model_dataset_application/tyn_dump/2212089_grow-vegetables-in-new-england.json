If you don\u2019t have a yard or good sunlight, consider renting a plot in a community garden to grow your vegetables. For example, tomatoes and eggplants require more sun than beans and cabbage."

          "description":"Loamy soil has a nice mix of clay, sand, and silt. Loamy soil tends to drain well and contains plenty of nutritious organic matter. To check drainage, dig a hole about 1 by 1 feet (0.30 m \u00d7 0.30 m). Fill it with water from a hose and time how long it takes to drain. Good soil should drain completely within 30 minutes. If water is still standing after a few hours, choose a different spot. Another way to check is to squeeze the soil. Loamy soil will hold together when squeezed. If you poke it, however, it should easily crumble."

Alternatively, take a soil sample to your local Extension office for professional testing. New England soil is typically acidic. This means that the pH is too low. Mix lime in with the soil a few weeks before planting to increase the pH. To raise the pH 1 point, buy about 7 pounds for every 100 feet (30 m) of soil. If your pH is too high, mix in sulfur. Both lime and sulfur can be bought at a garden store or  nursery. Search for your local extension office here: http://npic.orst.edu/pest/countyext.htm."
