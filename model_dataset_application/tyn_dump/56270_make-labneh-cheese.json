The cheese can be left for 1-2 days, until the desired consistency is reached. The longer that the cheese is left, the firmer it becomes. The process can be sped up by squeezing the cheesecloth/muslin to force the excess water out. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/93\\/56270-7-bullet-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-56270-7-bullet-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/93\\/56270-7-bullet-2.jpg\\/v4-759px-56270-7-bullet-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":308,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":508.4065934065934,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
