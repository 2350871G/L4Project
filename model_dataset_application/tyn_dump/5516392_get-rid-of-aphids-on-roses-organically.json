You may also want to remove any leaves, stems, or petals that have been heavily damaged by the aphids. If a petal or leaf is covered in tiny little holes, trim it off."

Set the nozzle on your hose to keep the water flowing as firmly as possible without damaging your roses. While they are obnoxious, aphids aren\u2019t particularly nimble or strong. Send the aphids careening into different parts of your garden by hosing them down with water.Tip: Spray your roses in the morning so that they have time to dry out in the sun. If you water them at night, you could promote the growth of fungus. Most aphids do not have wings and will be unable to get back on the rose shrubs once the water rinses them off."

          "description":"Purchase 250-1,500 ladybugs from a gardening or pest control store. Refrigerate your bugs for 20-45 minutes and release them late at night to lower the chance that they fly away immediately when you release them. Ladybugs feed on aphids, and a few ladybugs can go along way when it comes to eliminating pests.Tip: Ladybugs will not stay in your garden forever. Once most of the aphids have been eaten, they may fly off to a different area of your garden, or fly away altogether. Place your bugs around the base of your rose bushes and wait for them to wake up a little before they get to work. Mist the ladybugs with warm water after you drop them off to incentivize them to stay in your garden. Ladybugs prefer humid environments, so a little water will help keep them in your garden."

Add some bird baths and bird houses to make your garden an attractive spot for birds. Wrens, chickadees, and other small birds all love to eat aphids, although it may take them some time to get all of them.

The nectar will attract predatory insects, which will stick around your garden looking for prey. If your flowers are close enough to your roses, they\u2019ll start feeding on the aphids. Lacewings, hover flies, and wasps are all-natural predators of the aphid. They also happen to be attracted to nectar-secreting flowers, like cosmos or stonecrop. If you ever use a pesticide in your garden, you will end up killing the beneficial bugs too. Predatory wasps will sting you. Try to coexist peacefully with wasps, but if you end up with a nest nearby, you may need to get rid of it. Catnip, oregano, fennel, and mint will all attract predatory insects."
