If you need to, sand those rough patches away with a medium to fine-grit sandpaper. Be sure to sand with the grain rather than against it. If your piece has a very rough grain, you will need to sand it smooth first."

Peel the baking off of the foam sticker on the back, then apply it to the piece. Outline larger shapes or edges with glitter glue. If you don't have glitter glue, use regular white glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter on top. Apply a light layer of white paint with a dry brush for a vintage look.
