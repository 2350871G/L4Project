Work on the outer edge of the sticker until you have enough loose material to grab. Razor blades and other sharp scrapers are best suited for use on glass, smooth, hard metals, and similar materials that aren\u2019t easily damaged. If you\u2019re in a bind without a lot of options, a credit card or similar object can also do the trick."

Keep at it until you reach the far end. If the adhesive is putting up some resistance, try moistening it with warm water (assuming it\u2019s been applied to a waterproof surface).

    "Use the product remaining on your scrubber to buff out faint streaks of adhesive or paper left behind.",
    "If there are any heavy patches of adhesive residue clinging to the surface, apply a little fresh solution and go over it with a little elbow grease.",
    "Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after working with harsh chemical cleaners.",
    "Loosening the Sticker with Oil Grab a product with a high oil content.",
    "Chances are, you\u2019ve got plenty of items sitting around on the shelves of your pantry just waiting to be put to use.",
    "A bottle of ordinary cooking oil like olive or canola oil, for example, will bust up even the most difficult stickers.",
    "You could even use peanut butter or mayonnaise to achieve the same effect!",
    "A tablespoon of baking soda can up the unsticking power of oil-based products.",
    "These types of substances tend to work best on smooth, hard surfaces that aren't at risk of becoming darkened or discolored by oils.",
    "Smear the oil onto the sticker.",
    "Use a clean cloth to soak up a quarter-sized amount of oil and rub it over the entire surface.",
    "If the product is especially thick, it may help to pick up a flexible utensil like a rubber spatula or brush that will allow you to spread it around exactly where you need it.",
    "Avoid pouring thinner oils directly onto the surface.",
    "It can be easy to oversaturate it this way.",
    "Leave the oil in place for 10-20 minutes.",
    "Little by little, it will coat the bonds between the adhesive and the sticking surface and the sticker will begin to slip.",
    "The longer you allow it to take effect, the better the outcome will be.",
    "Wipe the excess oil away with a paper towel when time is up.",
    "Newer stickers may even come unfastened before you ever touch them.",
    "If you used a thicker oily substance, such as peanut butter, you may need to use a heavier towel or washcloth to expose the sticker underneath.",
    "Pull or scrub the sticker away.",
    "Scrape up the outer edge with your fingernail, peeling it back gradually until it\u2019s free.",
    "A soft kitchen sponge may come in handy for breaking up the last few bits of adhesive.",
    "By this point, it will likely have been reduced to a papery goop, so you shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble.",
    "Wipe the area clean with a towel and enjoy your new sticker-free surface!",
    "Eliminate any remaining patches of residue by blotting the spot with the corner of a towel soaked in oil.",
    "A light dusting of cornstarch or baby powder can absorb leftover oil coating the sticker surface."
