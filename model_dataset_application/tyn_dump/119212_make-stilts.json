          "description":"These will be trapezoid pieces of wood which will hold your feet. Get a piece of 1/2 inch plywood, and draw two triangles using a pencil. The triangles should have the following dimensions: 10 inch base, two 8 inch sides (use a ruler). It is best to use the edge of the plywood as the 10 inch base, that way one side of the triangle is already smooth and sanded. Use a table saw to cut out the two triangles. When you have them cut out, measure down 1 inch from where the two 8 inch sides meet (top point). Make a mark one inch down on both of the 8 inch sides. Connect these two points using a pencil and a ruler. Take your table saw out again and cut along the line. Make sure you do this to both triangles. Finally, take a piece of sand paper and smooth over the edges. You should now have two trapezoid shapes with 10 inch bases, and 7 inch sides (triangle with the top cut off)."

Go to one end of your four boards. Make a mark 1 inch down and 5 inches down on one of the boards using a pencil and ruler. Do this again on another one of the boards. Take your ruler and line up the two 1 inch marks. Draw a line connecting them which runs across all four boards. Take your ruler and line up the two 5 inch marks.

It is best to have an extra person nearby to catch you if you fall in the opposite direction. After you have mastered walking near your structure, begin to venture out.

    "Make sure that both stilts get a piece of velcro.",
    "Put the stilts on your legs.",
    "It is best to sit high-up, like on a bar stool, when you put your stilts on.",
    "Also, make sure that the stool is next to a higher structure, such as the edge of your house, or a fence, so that when you stand you have something to hold onto.",
    "Sit on the stool and put on each of the stilts on one at a time.",
    "Place your foot in the appropriate stilt.",
    "Slide it into the shoe and tie the shoe.",
    "Then, wrap the velcro around your leg tightly, and attach it around (the velcro sticks to itself).",
    "You do not want to wrap too tightly, otherwise you could lose circulation.",
    "Practice walking around with your stilts.",
    "Get out of your stool and stand up on your stilts, as you lean against a taller structure (fence, house, etc.)",
    "Walk back and forth slowly, holding onto the structure, to get used to how they feel.",
    "Once you feel comfortable enough, let your hands go, but continue to walk near the tall structure in case you fall.",
    "It is best to have an extra person nearby to catch you if you fall in the opposite direction.",
    "After you have mastered walking near your structure, begin to venture out.",
    "Continue to have someone follow you just in case you fall.",
    "It is best to walk around in your yard, in case the worst happens your fall won't hurt so bad.",
    "Take your stilts off.",
    "Once you are done walking around, sit back dow in the stool.",
    "Undo the velcro strips, and step out of the shoes.",
    "Place the stilts some place you won't forget them and they won't get damaged.",
    "You are now free to decorate your stilts if you would like.",
    "Add a coat of paint to them.",
    "You can stain the wood to protect it from moisture.",
    "You can even add stickers or pen designs.",
    "The possibilities are endless, and all up to you!"
