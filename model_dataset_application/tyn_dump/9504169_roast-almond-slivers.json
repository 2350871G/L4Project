  "text":" Using an Oven Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Don't roast the almond slivers at a higher temperature than this or they could burn. Spread out the almond slivers on a baking sheet. Don't worry about lining or greasing the baking sheet. Make sure the almond slivers are in an even layer. Put the almond slivers in the oven for 5 minutes. Don't leave them in for any longer or they could burn. It might help if you set a timer so you don't forget about them. Remove the almond slivers and stir them with a spoon. Push the almond slivers in the center of the baking sheet out toward the edges, and vice versa. This will help all the almond slivers roast evenly. Return the almond slivers to the oven for 3 more minutes. After 3 minutes, check on the almond slivers. They should be several shades darker than when you started. If they're not, leave them in in the oven and check on them every minute so they don't burn. Remove the almond slivers from the oven and transfer them to a plate. Don't leave the almond slivers on the pan to cool or they'll continue to roast. Let the almond slivers cool for several minutes before serving. Roasting on a Stovetop Melt 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of butter in a large pan. Place the pan on the stovetop and turn the burner to medium heat. Put the butter in the pan and wait for it to melt. Add \u20443 cup (79 mL) of almond slivers to the pan. Stir the almond slivers into the melted butter so they're evenly coated. Continue to stir the almonds as they roast. Roast the almond slivers in the pan for 3-4 minutes. After 3-4 minutes, the almond slivers should look light brown and roasted on the outside. Once the almonds are roasted, turn off the burner. Transfer the almond slivers to a plate with a paper towel on it. Let the almond slivers cool for several minutes. Once the almond slivers are slightly cooled, they're ready to serve. Using a Microwave Toss 1 cup (240 mL) of almond slivers with vegetable oil in a bowl. Use about \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of vegetable oil. Make sure the almond slivers are evenly coated with the oil. Spread out the almond slivers on a microwave-safe plate. Use a spoon or spatula to spread out the almonds so they're in an even layer. Microwave the almond slivers for 1 minute. After 1 minute, remove the almond slivers from the microwave and stir them. After you stir them, put the plate of almond slivers back in the microwave. Keep microwaving the slivers at 1-minute intervals until they're golden brown. After each minute interval, take the almond slivers out of the microwave and stir them. You'll know they're finished when they look golden brown and roasted on the outside. It could take between 3-8 minutes for the almond slivers to finish roasting.",
