They're just heavy enough to help a beyblade spin with more power, and they're easy to decorate and customize. Find a large white eraser - a round one, if possible - to use as the body of your beyblade. If you can't find an eraser that fits the bill, you can make the base of your beyblade out of white styrofoam. Find a flat piece of thick white styrofoam. Several pieces of cardboard glued together will also do the job."

In order for the beyblade to spin for a long time without falling over, the circle needs to be perfectly round. Irregularities will cause the beyblade to wobble when you spin it. To make a perfectly round circle, set a small water glass, candle holder or another small round-bottomed object on top of the beyblade base. Use a pencil to trace around the object. Cut out the circle with your scissors or a knife - whichever is more appropriate for the base you're using."

The pushpin will act as both a handle that'll allow you to launch the beyblade into a spin and the point on which the device spins. Once you push it through, test your beyblade to make sure it balances well and holds a spin. If your beyblade wobbles or falls over, take a look at the pin and make sure it's right in the center of the base. If you don't want to use a pushpin, try using a nail or screw.
