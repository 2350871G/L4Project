This way, you don't have to worry about spray paint spreading to items in your home or your home itself. You should also:\nAlways paint, prime, and stain in a well ventilated area. Fumes can build up in small rooms or in those with poor airflow and become toxic. Lay down a drop cloth beneath your wicker furniture, even when outside. This will prevent grass, dust, and similar things from getting in the way of or sticking to your paint job. Choose a location that is out of the wind.

A dust or crevice tool on your vacuum can help you better get narrow spots and in between the weavings. Dust and dirtiness left on your wicker will get in the way of your primer and paint bonding to it. Failing to clean your wicker first could result in a less than desirable finished result. If your wicker chair is relatively clean, you may only need to give it a quick vacuuming before moving on to priming the wicker."

Follow your soap's label directions for the best results. After your soapy water is mixed:\nUse your stiff bristle brush to loosen dirt, flaking paint, and so on from the wicker. Use medium force; brushing too hard could damage the wicker. Take your sponge and dunk it in the warm, soapy water. Use the sponge to clean any caked on dirt, ingrained dust, and so on. Use a \u00bd cup of bleach diluted in a quart (.95 L) of warm water, rubber gloves, and a sponge wet with the bleach mixture to remove and cleanse any mildew and mold from your wicker."

This finish can interfere with your paint or primer bonding to the wicker. The best method for applying your deglosser will depend on the brand. Follow your deglosser's instructions for best results. Generally, you should put on gloves, then wet a clean sponge or rag with the deglosser. Apply a thin layer of it to the chair from top to bottom. When finished deglossing, allow your chair to dry completely before moving on. If your chair was especially dirty and required heavy cleaning, you may want to let your wicker dry overnight."

When applying primer, use multiple thin layers for a smoother, better looking, more chip resistant finish. Shake your spray primer thoroughly and then apply it by pressing its applicator button. Spray it evenly onto all wicker surfaces, including crevices and in between weavings. Wear a dust mask when priming. When priming, keep your arm straight and use sweeping, left-to-right motions. Start from the top of the furniture and work your way to its bottom. Keep the spray applicator a few inches away from the wicker. For most kinds of primer, the benefits you receive from extra coats stops at five coats of primer. Save primer by applying no more than five coats. Primer is especially important when changing colors, or when covering over dark colors. Be sure to prime in these situations."

Use a clean sponge or paintbrush to smooth any drips, runs, or unevenness so your primer coat is smooth throughout. After touching up, allow your primer to dry completely before adding another coat. The wait time for your primer should be indicated on its can. In most cases you can expect your primer coats to dry fairly quickly."

In most cases, it is best to paint from top to bottom, though you may want to paint the underside and less visible parts of the furniture before painting its main parts. Much like primer, multiple thin coats of paint will look better and be more chip resistant. Use at least two thin layers of paint, and no more than five. After you are finished spray painting each coat, check for drips, runs, and uneven spots in your paint. Use a clean sponge or brush to touch up these so each coat is smooth and even. Give your first coat sufficient time to dry completely before adding the next one. The paint will likely be dry in a few hours, but wait two days before using the furniture so the paint fully cures."
