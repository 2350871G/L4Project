Otherwise, a 12-2 Romex\u00ae cable, which is one size larger than 14-2 Romex\u00ae cable and suitable for up to 20 amp circuits (or 16 amps continuous load) is the other size cable installed for outlets.

Oversimplified, the National Electrical Code (NEC) mandates outlets in the kitchen and dining room must be served by 20 amp circuits.

Part of this process involves removing the dead front assembly (the door over your breakers) and looking inside at the bussing. This can potentially be dangerous if you accidentally short out the metal plate to the bussing in the panel. Depending on the type of panel it can be relatively simple or very hazardous. Murray or Bryant type panels usually are the safest to install into. If your panel happens to be a Zinsco, Stablok or Pushmatic you can set yourself up for serious problems trying to do this yourself. For instance on Pushmatic panels the bussing is usually energized. Without the proper knowledge you could accidentally short the bussing out and cause a catastrophic failure (phase to ground or phase to phase short). The symmetrical amperage faults available are only limited by the primary fusing on the transformer and the overall design of the system. Just something to keep in mind when doing this job yourself.

    "Install the circuit breaker into the panel by first hooking or clipping to the grounded or insulated slot or rail (manufacturer dependent) on the outboard side of the insulated electrical contacts, then line up the clip or slot of the circuit breaker with the electrical contact rail or bus.",
    "Press the circuit breaker firmly into the panel.",
    "Some styles \"click\" into place others just \"bottom out\".",
    "If the new circuit breaker is \"even\" and aligned with adjacent circuit breakers, it is most likely properly seated.",
    "Remove circuit breaker k o from panel cover.",

    "After doing so, reinstall the cover onto the panel.",
    "Restore power to the panel.",
    "Do not stand in front of the panel, but rather to the SIDE of the panel and set the Main / Service Disconnect switch to ON.",
    "Next, move the new circuit breaker handle to ON and it will power up your electrical outlet that you have just installed.",
    "Test the work.",
    "Use a meter or plug the appliance or device into the outlet and turn it on.",
    "Verify that it is working and return to the panel.",
    "Listen for hum and or crackling.",
    "Either condition is indicative of a potential connection failure or heat build up.",
    "Label the circuit breaker.",
    "Do NOT install breakers from another manufacturer because \"they fit\" or even packaging states it is for use in these panels.",
    "Installing these breakers VOIDS the UL listing and can result in insurance problems if there is an electrical fire.",
    "Have you work inspected by your locality's code enforcement office.",
    "Plug circuits installed in bedrooms require use of an Arc Fault circuit breaker(s).",
    "Plugs installed in but not limited to basements, garages, outdoors, or indoors and accessible from grade, bathrooms, etc.",
    "will require a Ground Fault circuit breaker or plug, UNLESS it is dedicated to a \"fixed\" appliance such as a washer, refrigerator, etc.",
