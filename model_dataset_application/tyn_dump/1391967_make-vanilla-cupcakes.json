Whisk the dry ingredients until they're combined. Set the bowl aside. Avoid using self-rising flour since this recipe already includes baking powder and salt.

  "text":" Mixing the Batter Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and line a muffin tin. Get out a 12-hole muffin tin and put paper liners in each of the spaces.
