This will give you time to purchase cards, visit with friends, get something to drink, set up your station, and get your head in the game before it begins. When playing online bingo, make sure you have everything you need (something to drink, your phone, etc.) before you start a game."

Masking tape can help you keep your game pieces secured to your table (so you don\u2019t waste time adjusting them). You may also want to bring some good luck charms.

However, this only holds up if you are able to truly check the numbers on all of your cards effectively. Start with no more than 4 cards. If you feel you\u2019ve gotten the hang of 4 cards, try adding 1 card at a time. In a game with 20 players where everyone has 1 card, every player has a 5% chance of winning.

If you can, look for bingo cards with more numbers toward the median. In a game that goes from  1-99, the median would be 45. The Tippett theory has never been proven.
