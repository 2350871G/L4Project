    "Mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium-sized bowl.",
    "Sift the 2 cups of all-purpose flour into the bowl first to break up any clumps, then add the baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.",
    "Stir everything together until all the ingredients are well-combined.",
    "When you are done, set the flour mixture aside.",
    "Cream the butter and sugar in a separate bowl.",
    "Cut the butter into small cubes first, then add it into a bowl with the sugar.",
    "Beat the butter and sugar together using a hand-held mixer or a stand mixer for about 3 minutes.",
    "If you do not own an electric mixer, you can use a food processor instead.",
    "Stir the eggs into the butter mixture, one egg at a time, then add the vanilla extract.",
    "Beat the butter mixture well after each egg that you add.",
    "Once you have the eggs added in, stir in the vanilla extract.",
    "Be sure to blend the mixture well; you do not want to see any streaks of egg yolk.",
    "Alternate between adding the flour mixture and the milk.",
    "Fold in half of the flour mixture first, then add half of the milk.",
    "Stir everything together with a rubber spatula, then repeat with the rest of the flour mixture and milk.",
    "Fold in the floured cinnamon apples with a rubber spatula.",
    "Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl often, so that everything blends together evenly.",
    "Fill the muffin cups \u2154 to \u00be of the way with the batter.",
    "A simple way to do this would be with an ice cream scoop.",
    "This will ensure that each cup gets the same amount of batter.",
    "Bake the muffins for 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "They are ready when a toothpick poked into the center of a muffin comes out clean.",
    "If the muffins are underdone, bake them for another 5 minutes.",
    "Let the muffins cool while you prepare the butter and cinnamon topping.",
    "Melt \u00bd cup (115 grams) of butter and pour it into a bowl deep enough to dip a muffin into.",
    "In a separate bowl, stir together the \u00bc cup (55 grams) of granulated sugar with \u00bc cup (30 grams) of ground cinnamon.",
    "Set the bowls down side-by-side on the counter.",
    "Take the muffins out of the tin, then dip them into the butter and cinnamon-sugar.",
    "After the muffins have cooled for about 10 minutes, take all of the muffins out of the tin.",
    "Then, working one muffin at a time, dip the top of the muffin into the melted butter, then quickly dip it into the cinnamon sugar.",
    "Hold the muffin by the bottom, and rotate it slightly as you dip it into the butter and cinnamon-sugar.",
    "This way, you can ensure that the entire top of the muffin gets evenly coated.",
    "Set the muffins down onto a plate or wire cooling rack so that they can finish cooling off.",
    "They are ready to eat once the butter sets, and the cinnamon sugar hardens into a crust-like topping.",
    "Finished.",
    "Finished."
