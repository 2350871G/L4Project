You must have several consecutive days with at least 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). Humidity should be less than 60 percent. Get a screen or wood tray for a drying rack. Choose a screen made from plastic, stainless steel, or fiberglass coated with Teflon. These types can be safely used for fruit.
