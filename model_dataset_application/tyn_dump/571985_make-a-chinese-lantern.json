    "This lantern is perfect for those who like working with glue.",
    "Because it requires so much glue, however, you will need to give it some time to dry.",
    "If you are in a hurry, this might not be the right choice for you; the lantern will need at least a day to dry.",
    "Here's what you'll need to make this lantern:\nBalloon\nTissue paper (white and red/yellow)\nScissors (optional)\nPaintbrush or foam brush\nWhite school glue\nWater\nBlack or gold permanent marker (optional)\nString\nHole puncher\nBattery-operated tea light Blow up a balloon.",
    "Not too big or it may pop.",
    "Cut or tear some colored tissue paper into small squares of thin strips.",
    "You will need some white tissue paper for the first few layers; this will make your lamp glow brighter.",
    "You will also need some red or yellow tissue paper for the last two to three layers.",
    "You can even use both colors, if you want.",
    "Be sure to keep the white tissue paper separate from the other colors.",
    "Mix 1 part glue and 1 part water together in a bowl.",
    "This will be your papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 paste.",
    "Make sure that you are using white school glue, as the clear type won't work.",
    "Start applying the white tissue paper pieces to the balloon.",
    "Dip your paintbrush or foam brush into the glue mixture and dab some glue onto the balloon.",
    "You don't need a lot of glue\u2014just a thin layer.",
    "This will give the tissue paper something to hold on to.",
    "Place a piece of white tissue paper over the glue and smooth it down.",
    "You can use your fingers, if you don't mind getting dirty, or your paintbrush/foam brush.",
    "Try to get the paper as smooth as possible.",
    "Keep going until the entire balloon is covered.",
    "Be sure to leave some room near the bottom of the balloon where the knot is.",
    "You can to be able to reach inside the lantern, once it dries and you pop the balloon.",
    "Consider keeping your balloon in a bowl; this will help keep it still and prevent it from rolling all over the place.",
    "Add two more layers of white tissue paper.",
    "Be sure to let the first layer dry a little bit before you add another.",
    "If your balloon starts to get too soggy, set it aside.",
    "You may also notice that after enough layers, you may not need to use much glue if at all; the lower layers will help soak up the upper layers.",
    "Add two to three more layers of your other color.",
    "You are adding so many layers to make your lantern sturdy.",
    "If you don't use enough layers, your lamp will turn out flimsy.",
    "Let the lantern dry.",
    "This may take 1 to 2 days.",
    "The lantern must be completely dry before you move on to the next step, or it will cave in on itself.",
    "Decorate the lantern.",
    "You can use a black or gold permanent marker to draw a Chinese character on the lantern.",
    "You can also draw designs on the lantern using glue, and then sprinkle gold glitter over the glue.",
    "If you use glue to decorate the lantern, be sure to let it dry before moving on to the next step.",
    "Pop the balloon and pull it out through the hole.",
    "This is now the top of your lantern.",
    "If the lantern caves in on itself, simply reach inside, and pop it back out into shape.",
    "At this point, you can also use some scissors to clean up the edges of the tissue paper.",
    "Use a hole puncher to poke two holes in the top of the lantern.",
    "They need to be straight across from each other, or the lantern won't balance right.",
    "Thread a long piece of string through both holes.",
    "Tie the ends of the string together into a tight knot.",
    "Insert the light and hang the lantern.",
    "Switch on a battery-operated tea light and drop it into the lantern.",
    "You don't want to use a real candle or a light bulb, as both can lead to a fire.",
    "Use the string to hang the lantern.",
    "Make a Chinese Lantern Candle Holder Gather your supplies.",
    "This lantern is a little bit different from the rest.",
    "You can't hang it anywhere, because it is made from glass.",
    "You can, however, use it as a real candleholder.",
    "Try not to get it wet, however; you can wipe it clean with a damp cloth, but if you leave it sitting in water, the Mod Podge will flake off.",
    "Here's what you'll need to make this lantern:\nShort, squat jar\nRed tissue paper\nMod Podge\nPaintbrush or foam brush\nPaper plate or palette\nScissors\nBlack paint\nGold glitter, glue, sequins, markers, etc (optional) Find a short, squat jar.",
    "You want the jar to be low with a wide mouth.",
    "It should be almost round or square in shape.",
    "Clean the jar well, and dry it off.",
    "Use soap and warm water to wash it.",
    "You can also wipe it down with a cotton ball soaked in some rubbing alcohol.",
    "If there are any labels on the jar, be sure to remove them, or they will show up when you are done.",
    "Cut or tear red tissue paper into small pieces.",
    "The pieces should be proportionate to the jar.",
    "For a very small jar, make the pieces about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) big.",
    "For a larger jar, try something that is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) big.",
    "Paint the entire jar using Mod Podge.",
    "You can use a paintbrush or a foam brush.",
    "If you are working on a large jar, you can paint a small section first.",
    "If you don't have any Mod Podge, you can mix one part white school glue with one part water.",
    "Cover the entire jar with tissue paper, including the neck.",
    "Use your fingers or your paintbrush/foam brush to smooth the paper down so that you don't get any wrinkles.",
    "Try not to overlap the tissue paper too much, or the light won't shine through as well.",
    "It's okay if the tissue paper extends past the neck.",
    "You want the next to be covered, so that the paint will have something to stick to.",
    "Wait for the jar to dry, then paint it with another layer of Mod Podge.",
    "This will seal the jar.",
    "Trim the excess tissue paper off.",
    "Use your scissors to trim off the excess tissue paper from the top of the jar.",
    "Paint the top edge/neck of the jar black.",
    "Squirt some black paint out onto a paper plate or a palette.",
    "Dip your paintbrush into the paint, and paint the entire neck of the jar black.",
    "This will resemble the top of the lantern.",
    "Decorate the jar.",
    "Use a black marker or glitter glue to draw some symbols onto the lantern.",
    "You can use Chinese characters, dragons, yin-yang, and so forth.",
    "You can also glue on some sequins or loose glitter onto the lantern as well.",
    "Let the lantern dry completely before you use it.",
    "You can use a real tea light inside the lantern, or a battery-operated tea light."
