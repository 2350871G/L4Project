The safest way to remove lime scale or to remove rust from a kitchen sink is with vinegar. Fill a plastic bag with white vinegar. Place the bag over the faucet, holding it in place with a rubber band. Make sure that the buildup is submerged in the vinegar. Let the faucet sit in vinegar for one hour. Remove the plastic bag and run warn water through the faucet. Scrub away any additional buildup with a recycled toothbrush or sponge."

There are two different adapter and washer sets provided with your kit. Examine your faucet and examine both adapters to determine which adapter should be used.
