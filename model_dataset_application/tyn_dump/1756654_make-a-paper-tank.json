  "text":" Preparing the Paper Fold a sheet of paper in half. You will end up with a rectangle piece of paper. Before committing to a hard fold, make a soft fold to be sure it is properly placed. The larger the paper, the larger the tank. If you are doing this for the first time, using a larger sheet of paper (at least 8.5 x11 inch) will make the process easier. You can also use origami paper. Cut or rip the paper in half along the fold. You can discard the other half or save it to make another tank. Fold the paper in half again. With this fold you are making a long rectangle. Making the Tank Fold the ends of the paper into an X. Take one corner and fold diagonally to create a point. Unfold and repeat, folding the other side diagonally. When you unfold you will see the creases form an X. Repeat on the other end of the paper. Create pointed ends. Push in the sides of the paper where you made the folds (the X at each end). The paper will fold in on itself and create a point. Do this on both ends of the paper. Both ends now have an arrow shape. Make the wheels. Fold both of the long sides of the paper once inwards towards the center. Take the inside edge and fold once again outwards, creating a flap. Making the Turret Make the first part of the turret. Choose one end of the paper. Fold the ends of the arrow up and towards the middle. Leave a small gap in the center. Turn the paper over. The smooth side (without the folds visible) should be facing up. Fold each end up. The end with the larger point (which looks like an arrow) should rest on top of the smaller end. Tuck the flap below the larger point into the smaller point. The larger (arrow) end will rest in the gap created when you folded the first part of the turret. Tuck the points of the first part of the turret underneath the sides of the arrow. Fold the points of the arrow under the turret points, locking them together to form the full turret. Finishing the Tank Pull out the wheels. With your finger, gently unfold the flaps that are the wheels. Do this on both sides. Add the gun. Insert a straw into the narrowest end of the top. You can also use a small piece of rolled up paper. Secure the gun. If the gun falls out, you can use tape or glue to secure it.",
