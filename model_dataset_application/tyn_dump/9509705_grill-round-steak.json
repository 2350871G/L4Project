Gently slide the blade of a short, sharp knife under the unwanted pieces and slide the blade down to remove the fat in thin layers. Trim fat carefully and in thin layers. Trimming too quickly could end up taking chunks of meat off, too. Steak is marbled with fat, which helps keep it moist and tender. Trim away large chunks of fat around the edges, but don\u2019t worry about trying to pick out small veins of fat in the center of the steak. Those will render down as you grill the steak."

          "description":"Round steak is a notoriously tough cut of meat, and tenderizing it can help cook it evenly and make it easier to chew. Use a meat tenderizer to pound your steaks until they look ragged but still together. The meat should be roughly 0.5 in (1.27 cm) thick once you\u2019re done. Tenderizing isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but it will help make a round steak more palatable once cooked."

The most basic way is to sprinkle a liberal pinch of kosher salt on each side of the steak. Other seasoning options include:\nMixing an even ratio of dried oregano and onion powder along with a pinch of salt and a clove of finely chopped garlic. The amount you need will depend on the amount of steak you have, and how much of the seasoning flavor you want to maintain. Experiment with different blends to find the right option for you. Combining a quarter cup (59 ml) of olive oil, a pinch of salt, a sprig of fresh rosemary, a sprig of fresh thyme, and 2 halved garlic cloves together in a plastic bag as a marinade."
