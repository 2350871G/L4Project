Fold the paper on a diagonal axis, again. The line that you are folding now will start from one corner, and will end in the middle of the other two corners.

By making the vertical valley fold, you've allowed a pocket to be formed. This is where your finger will go. Using an Alternative Technique Place the paper on a flat surface. Position the paper horizontally. You can use any type of paper you have lying around the house. If you want sturdier claws, then use thicker paper. Fold the top left corner over and down. Align the fold to the paper's bottom. The left side of the sheet now has a point. Fold the two corners on the right side. Only fold these corners to the line of the previous fold. This will create two smaller triangles. Fold the left point over. Imagine this right triangle without the other two triangles. Just fold the right tip to the opposite tip of the right triangle. Use the excess strip. Fold the excess strip with the two smaller triangles up onto the other triangle. This will form a triangle with this recent fold on top of it. Fold the paper in half.
