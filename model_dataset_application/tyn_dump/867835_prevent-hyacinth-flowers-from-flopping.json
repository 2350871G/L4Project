If the bulbs aren't planted deep enough, the plant's stem won't have enough strength to support the weight of the flowers when the hyacinth blooms.

Your hyacinth will naturally grow towards the sun. This can cause it to bend, making it more susceptible to snapping. If it's in a planter, turning it every few days will help it to grow straight. Supporting Hyacinths Cut a stake so it's the height of your plant, plus 4 inches (10 cm). Since hyacinths are a top-heavy flower, they have a tendency to flop over even if they are grown under ideal conditions. They often need some kind of support, such as being tied to a stake. Tie the stakes to the stems if your hyacinths start to droop. Place your stake about 1 inch (2.5 cm) the stalk of your hyacinth, inserting it into the ground about 4 inches (10 cm). Attach the plant to the stake with twine. To secure the plant, tie the plant to the stake with 3 pieces of twine: one at the top of the plant, one in the middle, and one at the bottom. Use a forked stake for more support. If you like, you can use a forked stake or twig from a nearby tree to support the bloom on your hyacinth.

Most hyacinths are discarded after they flower, so it won't matter if the wire damages the bulb. Use a sturdy floral wire, available at any garden store. Cutting Your Hyacinths Cut or dig up your hyacinth blooms early in the morning. Plants are most hydrated in the morning, since they've gotten moisture from the night air and the morning dew. This hydration fills the stems with water and makes your plants stand up straighter. Leave your hyacinth on the bulb if you choose. Some people prefer to leave their hyacinths attached to the bulb. In this case, dig up your hyacinth, rinse it under cold water, and place the entire plant into a vase. Cut the stem 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the ground if you don't want the bulb. This should leave enough stem to support the weight of the flower. Use garden shears to cut your flowers, as kitchen shears will crush the flower's vascular system and prevent water uptake. This will cause your flower to droop. Place your cut flowers in a bucket of water immediately. If air gets into the stem, it will prevent your flower from being able to take in water from the vase. Submerging your flower stems in water immediately after cutting the stems will help prevent this. Insert a pin into the stem just below the bloom if your flower is still drooping.
