  "text":" Speeding up the Cube Invest in a quality Rubik\u2019s cube. A quality cube's parts will move with ease, and they come in a variety of sizes, such as 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5. Most people start off with a 3x3 cube. Go with options like Moyu, YJ, Dayan,  Shengshou or Fangshi (Funs puzzle).For speed-cubing stay away from the actual Rubiks brand. These cubes were not build for speed-cubing and are far worse than any speed cube. You can purchase them online or in stores. A good cube used to set past records only cost $9, though typically quality Rubik\u2019s cubes cost around $15 and up (\u20ac4-20). A quality speed cube is helpful because turning takes very little force. Even if the layers aren\u2019t perfectly aligned, the cube will still turn. You don't need to be completely accurate with every turn. Disassemble your cube in order to lubricate it. Disassemble your cube by rotating the top face 45 degrees and popping out an upper edge piece. You can do this with your fingers, or use a screwdriver if you are having trouble. Apply a silicone-based spray or gel to the inside parts to lubricate your cube. Ensure you apply a light, even coat across all surfaces of your cube. Let your parts dry for about 10 minutes.

When learning how to solve a Rubik\u2019s cube, it is helpful to start on the white side. Though, this isn\u2019t always the easiest to solve. Be flexible and try different sides. The more you can maneuver your cube, the faster you can solve it. Experiment with algorithms to help you solve your cube faster. To understand how to move the Rubik\u2019s cube, speed solvers mark every face of the cube with a letter: F- Front, U- Up, R- Right, B- Back, L- Left, and D- Down. Algorithms are codes made up of different movement combinations, and many different algorithms can be used to speed up the time it takes to solve. Master the CFOP Method. CFOP (also known as the Advanced Fridrich method) is the most popular method for speedsolving. There are four steps to this method: White cross, first two layers (F2L), orient last layer (OLL), and permute last layer (PLL). Reducing Delays Between Moves Plan ahead to reduce delays between your moves. Scramble the cube, and then take a second to notice the details before you start trying to solve.

For example, if you're using the Fridrich Method, practice your first two layers. While you're solving one pair, look ahead to find your next pair. This eliminates any pauses in between your moves.

If you get to be this speedy, you might be a contender for some world records! However, learn at your own pace to begin with. Understand that it takes time to master the moves and solve the cube super fast. Using Finger Tricks Learn finger tricks and shortcuts to perform faster moves. Finger tricks are extremely fast moves performed with only one finger. These shortcuts can reduce your solving time by up to 10 moves per second. Try U, R, L, and B moves. Finger tricks are easier to complete if your Rubik\u2019s cube is lubricated Perform U moves by using the index finger of both hands. Push the top layer in your desired direction while keeping your other fingers away from the top layer. Complete R moves by holding the right face with your right hand. Keep your thumb on the bottom edge and your first three fingers on the top three pieces. Hold the cube with your left hand. Rotate your right wrist to perform the R and R2 move. Do L moves with the same method as R, just inverted. Instead, use your left hand and hold the left face. Perform B moves by rotating the puzzle so the B face is on top. Turn the cube as if the B face was the U face, and solve from this side. This move is tricky and rare in speedsolving. Hold the cube from the middle and top layers to complete D moves. Using your thumb and first two fingers, hold the cube from the middle and top layers. Leave room for your pinky and ring finger behind the puzzle. Use either ring fingers to push the layer where you need to move it. D moves are the most difficult and take the longest to master. Using Outside Resources Watch video tutorials on the internet to learn speed techniques. Learn speed solving methods by watching other speed solvers online. There are many tutorials on YouTube.
