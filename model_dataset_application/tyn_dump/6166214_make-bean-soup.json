          "description":"Pour roughly 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into a large saucepan and place it over a medium heat. Let the oil begin warming, to the point that it is easily moved around the bottom of the saucepan when tilted. Any other cooking oil will work here, such as vegetable or canola, but it may not taste quite the same. If you don\u2019t like the taste of olive oil, use an oil that you enjoy instead. You can begin cutting up the vegetables in the next few steps while waiting for the oil to heat up, which should save on time."

Peel and dice 2 cloves of garlic as well, and add them to the saucepan with the hot oil to begin sauteing. There are plenty of different ways to cut onion and garlic. Choose an easy method that works for you."

Line the celery sticks up and use a sharp knife to cut them into chunks that are roughly \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in width. Add the chopped celery to the pan with the onion, garlic, and oil. The celery will help add a little sweetness and freshness to the soup, but it can also be left out if you don\u2019t like the taste."

Cut up a few bell peppers into a rough, \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) dice and add them to the saucepan to begin cooking. For a little more variety, use 1 green bell pepper and 1 red bell pepper, chopped in the same way. If you want even more of a kick to your soup, try adding some finely diced chili peppers as well. Finely slice 1 fresh red chili pepper and add it to the saucepan with the other ingredients."

Add any other vegetables you have in your kitchen to the soup, chopping them into roughly \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces before stirring them in. Mushrooms, potatoes, carrots, and peas could all make great additions to this soup. Add whatever you have on hand and see how it tastes!"

Let them saute for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and all of the other vegetables become fragrant. While they will cook further as the soup cooks, sauteing the vegetables first will make the whole dish taste much better. If you\u2019re particularly short on time, you can throw them into the saucepan with all the other ingredients to cook. The vegetables should be vibrant colors and just beginning to soften after around 10 to 15 minutes. These signs, along with the more fragrant aroma of the vegetables, are a good sign that they are ready."

Sprinkle over roughly 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 tablespoon (6 g) of black pepper and stir to combine. If you want to add any other flavors or seasonings to the soup, mix them in now. For a little aromatic freshness, try mixing in 1 tablespoon (6 g) of thyme, rosemary, oregano, or cilantro. If you want a little extra spiciness, add in 1 teaspoon (2 g) of chili powder or cayenne pepper. For a slightly smoky flavor in your soup, mix in 1 tablespoon (6 g) of smoked paprika."

Pour 2 14-oz (40- g) cans of black, kidney, cannellini, or whatever other types of canned bean you have into the saucepan and stir to combine. You can also use dried beans that have soaked first instead. Boil 1 cup (225 g) of dried beans in enough water to cover them for around 2 minutes, before leaving them to soak for around 1 hour.

Add around 2 cups (470 ml) of whatever stock you have on hand or that you enjoy. Chicken and vegetable stock will both work excellently, but you can easily use beef stock or even just water instead. For a slightly more complex flavor in your finished soup, try adding different types of stock. Use 1 cup (240 ml) each of chicken and vegetable stock, or any other combination you like.

Scatter over the top of your soup and mix it in. This is another great point to customize your soup to your own preferences. Leftover chicken, beef, lamb, ham, meatballs, and anything else can add some more flavor to the soup. Use roughly 1 cup (125 g to 175 g) of whatever diced meat you choose to use. You can add more or less depending on how meaty you want your soup to be. If you\u2019re a vegetarian or vegan, or you simply don\u2019t want to add meat to your soup, feel free to skip this step."

Cover it and leave it to simmer for around 40 minutes, giving it time to thicken up and cook the beans. If you want a thicker soup, remove the lid after 40 minutes and let it simmer for a further 10 minutes. This will let more liquid cook off and result in a thicker, heartier soup."

Use a hand or stick blender to begin processing the soup and blending some of the beans and other ingredients. This will make it creamier and a little smoother. The more you blend your soup, the thicker and smoother it will be. For a thinner soup with more chunks, blend the soup for only a few seconds. Alternately, you can avoid blending it at all for a very thin and chunky soup. If you prefer your soup to be thick and very smooth, blend it until all of the beans have been processed and the soup reaches a creamier consistency. If you don\u2019t have a hand or stick blender, you can pour your soup in the jug of a standard kitchen blender to process it slightly. You may need to work in batches depending on the size of your blender."

Mix it thoroughly to combine for a slightly smoother and richer soup. If you want to keep this recipe vegan, you can skip this step entirely. You could also use the same amount of sour cream or yogurt for extra thickness and creaminess. However, this will also impart the flavor of your chosen yogurt or sour cream into the soup. If you don't like the taste of sour cream, yogurt, milk, or cream, then leave them out of this dish."

Break 4 eggs into the soup so that they are spread apart and just submerged. Leave the eggs to cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the whites are cooked and the yolks are runny. When serving, fill a bowl with soup and place the poached eggs onto it last. When you pierce the yolk, it will run across the soup, both looking and tasting incredible. Break the eggs, one at a time, into a small bowl first. Use the bowl to pour the eggs carefully into the soup. This will help keep the eggs together as you transfer them to the saucepan."

Once cooked, you can store the soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days."
