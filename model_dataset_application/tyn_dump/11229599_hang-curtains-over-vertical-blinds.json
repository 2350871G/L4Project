          "description":"The cornice is an ornamental type of padding that is used to disguise the tops of blinds; they\u2019re often made of plastic or covered with fabric. If you look between the cornice and the blinds, you\u2019ll see that there is space to suspend a tension rod between the 2 sides of the cornice. You can hang curtains from the tension rod and install them within minutes. Depending on the setup behind the cornice, you could even use a wooden dowel to hang the curtains. If your blinds don\u2019t have a cornice, you could make one yourself to elevate the look of your room even more.Tip: Tension rods aren\u2019t made to hold a lot of weight, so they\u2019re best used to hang sheer or very light curtains."

          "description":"Wipe down the inside of the cornice that is covering your vertical blinds to remove any dust or grime. Attach one side of the velcro to the cornice and the other side to the top of the exterior of the curtains. Take your time and make sure that the strips of velcro are lined up evenly. Once you\u2019re done, attach the curtains to the cornice. Choose \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide velcro for sheer curtains. Pick a wider velcro for heavier material. The one downfall of using velcro is that you won\u2019t be able to slide your curtains back and forth. But, if you\u2019re mainly interested in the aesthetic rather than the functionality, this shouldn\u2019t be a problem."
