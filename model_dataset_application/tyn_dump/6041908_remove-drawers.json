          "description":"Stand in front of the piece of furniture, take hold of the handle or knob on the front panel, and begin sliding the drawer out until it stops moving. If the drawer doesn\u2019t have a stopper, it should come right out. If you encounter resistance, you\u2019ll need to move the drawer around a little in order to work it free. Most drawers contain some type of stopping mechanism designed to keep them from falling out accidentally. In free-rolling drawers, the stopper is typically a small raised lip on the front side of the interior track. Be sure to keep enough space between you and the front of the drawer to allow it to extend all the way out.Tip: Wood-Glide draws can sometimes seem to stick a little, even if they\u2019re not fitted with stoppers. Before you start searching for obstructions, try giving the drawer a good tug to see if that gets it past its sticking point."

This will cause the wheels or lip on the back edge to raise up higher than the stopper at the front of the track, making it possible to pull the drawer out the rest of the way. You may need to rock or jostle the drawer to help free the wheels from the track. Be careful not to get too rough with it, though, or you could damage it or its attached hardware."

Set the drawer aside on a flat, stable surface and repeat the process for any additional drawers you wish to remove. If you\u2019re still having trouble getting the drawer out, there\u2019s a chance that it may be equipped with another type of stopping mechanism, such as levers or stabilizer screws."
