Keep the can at least 6 in (15 cm) or so away from the surface of the vent so the spray paint doesn\u2019t drip and create lumps on the surface. To coat the vent evenly, work in a slow, horizontal motion across the surface of the vent. Be sure to paint over the screws as well.Tip: If the color isn\u2019t vibrant enough, consider adding a second coat of paint! Let the first coat dry for whatever recommended time is listed on the can. Then, turn the vent 90 degrees and apply a second coat of paint to the surface! This rotation helps ensure even coverage over the surface of your vent."
