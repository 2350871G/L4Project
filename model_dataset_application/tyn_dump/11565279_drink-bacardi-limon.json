          "description":"Get a clean lowball glass and set it out on your counter. Use a jigger, or a measuring cup to measure out 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of Bacardi Limon. Slowly pour the Bacardi Limon into your glass to avoid spills. Then, enjoy your Bacardi Limon neat. You can also measure the Bacardi by eye and simply fill the bottom 1/8 of your glass. Exact measurements aren\u2019t as important when it comes to pouring neat pours since you aren\u2019t mixing anything. The term \u201cneat\u201d is used in bartending to refer to a drink that is not mixed or poured over ice. A jigger is a bartending tool that looks like 2 cones connected to one another. The smaller cone-shaped cup is usually a 1  fl oz (30 mL) measurement, while the bigger cup is measures out 2  fl oz (59 mL). While a lowball glass is ideal for neat pours of spirits, you can use any kind of glass that you\u2019d like. A lowball glass is also known as an Old Fashioned glass or tumbler."
