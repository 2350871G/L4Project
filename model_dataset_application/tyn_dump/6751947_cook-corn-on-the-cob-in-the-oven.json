If there's another oven rack above the center rack, you can let it remain in place as long as it does not come into contact with the corn. If it does, you should remove it completely or move it to a position beneath the center rack. Try to keep the corn in a single layer. If you need to stack it, you may need to increase the overall cooking time. You'll also need to make sure that the pile of corn does not touch the upper heating element of the oven.

Consider holding the base of each ear with an oven mitt before peeling down the husks. Also note that the steam escaping from the corn will be very hot, so you should never point the ears directly at your face.
