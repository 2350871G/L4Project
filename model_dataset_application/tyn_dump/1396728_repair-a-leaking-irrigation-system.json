Lift the lid of each of your valve boxes and check the soil to see if it\u2019s wet. If there\u2019s standing water inside one of the valve boxes, then the leak may be occurring because debris is trapped in the valve. If the boxes are dry, then the leak may be located somewhere else in your yard. The number of valve boxes in your yard depends on how many sprinklers you have attached to your system. Smaller systems may only have 1-2 valve boxes, but larger systems may have multiple spread throughout the yard. If you aren\u2019t sure where your valve boxes are in your yard, call an irrigation professional to inspect your system for you."

Make sure your irrigation system is turned off at the controller so it doesn\u2019t turn on while you\u2019re working. Look for the shut-off valve for your irrigation system either inside or outside near your water meter, and rotate the handle so it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipe.

Always keep your irrigation system\u2019s water supply off while you make repairs or else water will constantly run through the pipes and make it difficult or messy to work with. Unscrew the lid on your main valve to expose the rubber diaphragm. Check the valve box that\u2019s leaking and locate the circular lid to the solenoid valve that has screws on top. Use a screwdriver to rotate the screws counterclockwise and set them in a small container so you don\u2019t lose them in your yard. Pull the lid off of the valve to reveal a circular rubber piece, also known as the diaphragm. If you can\u2019t easily access the lid on the valve due to flooding, then use a bucket or a turkey baster to get some of the water out of the way.Tip: If your valve doesn\u2019t have a lid that easily screws off, you may need to unscrew the whole valve system by rotating it counterclockwise. Rinse and dry the rubber diaphragm to remove any debris inside. Carefully pull the rubber diaphragm out of the valve and inspect it for any rips or tears.

Turn on the water supply for your irrigation system and watch the valve box to see if it still floods inside. If the box stays dry, then cleaning the diaphragm fixed the leak. If there is still a leak that occurs inside the valve box, the valve may be faulty and you need to have a professional replace it. Checking the Sprinkler Connection Turn off the water to your irrigation system. Make sure the irrigation controller is turned off so it doesn\u2019t automatically turn on while you\u2019re working. Locate the main shut-off valve for your irrigation system connected to an indoor or outdoor pipe near your water meter. Rotate the handle so it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipe to ensure that water doesn\u2019t flow through the pipes or hoses anymore. Clean the sprinkler head filter with water to see if it\u2019s clogged. Grip the top of the sprinkler head with a pair of pliers and gently pull it up to raise the sprayer. Rotate the spray head counterclockwise to unscrew it from the base and remove the filter. Rinse the filter and sprayer under clean water to remove any clogs or debris before reattaching it to the sprinkler system. Rotate the sprinkler head until the sprayer points at your yard again. While cleaning out the filter won\u2019t fix a leak, it will help prevent them in the future since clogs can cause the water pressure to build and burst a hose connection. Dig up the ground around the sprinkler head that\u2019s leaking. Start your shovel about 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) away from the sprinkler, and remove the soil and grass around it. Work slowly and carefully so you don\u2019t break any hoses or pipes by accident, removing at least 6 inches (15 cm) of soil in each direction from the sprinkler.

Wait 2-3 minutes for the water to cycle through the hoses before you start working. The hoses may still have a little residual water in them when you remove or repair them. Dig up the area 12 in (30 cm) around the broken hose. Locate the area where you suspect the leak, and start carefully digging into the ground with a shovel. Don\u2019t use a lot of force so you don\u2019t accidentally break the hose while you\u2019re digging. Dig out 12 inches (30 cm) horizontally from each side of the hose so you have room to work. Expose the broken section of the hose and 6 inches (15 cm) of excess on each side. Contact your local utility companies before you start digging to find out if there are any buried power or gas lines in your yard that you should avoid. If you dig up the hose and you still don\u2019t see any damage, then the leak may be draining from a different area of your yard. Call a professional irrigation service if you can\u2019t locate where the leaking hose is in your yard since they may be able to locate it for you.Tip: Clean out as much mud or water as you can with a bucket so the area is dry during your repair. Remove the broken section of hose with pipe cutters. Measure at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) from each side of the ruptured hose and make a guide line using a marker. Open your pipe cutters and place the hose between the jaws. Squeeze the handles together to make a straight cut through the hose and remove the broken piece. If the entire hose looks cracked or damaged, then you may need to replace it completely. Cut a piece of hose that\u2019s the same length as the section you just removed. Get a roll of PVC hosing from your local hardware store. Make sure you use a hose that\u2019s the same diameter as the existing one so it\u2019s able to fit together well. Use the piece of hose you just removed as a guide for cutting your new piece. Hold the old piece of hose up against the new piece and make your cuts with the pipe cutters. Many irrigation lines use \u204410 in (1.8 cm) thick hoses, but it may vary depending on your system. Fit a compression coupling onto either side of the new hose section. Compression couplings are pieces of PVC that connect 2 pieces of hose together with a watertight seal. Make sure to use compression couplings that match the size and diameter of your hose, or else they may leak. Slide the couplings halfway onto the ends of the piece of hose so they don\u2019t move or slip around. Keep pushing the couplings on until it covers about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of the hose\u2019s ends. You can buy compression couplings from your local hardware store. If you have trouble sliding the coupling onto the hose, wet the edges of the hose with clean water to push them in easier. Slide the compression couplings onto the cut ends of the buried hose. Once the compression couplings are on your new piece of hose, then push the other end of the coupling onto the hose that\u2019s buried in the ground. Make sure about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of the hose goes into the coupling so it has a tight connection. If you need to, wet the ends of the hose to make it easier to push into the couplings. You do not need to use any adhesives or waterproofing material to secure the couplings since they are already watertight. Turn on your water supply to check if the hose leaks before filling in the hole. Open the shut-off valve to your irrigation system and turn on the controller to the area you\u2019re working on. Watch the hose for any leaks or water spraying out of it to see if the couplings worked. If they do, then start filling in the hole you dug with fresh, dry soil and pack it down tightly to hold it in place. If the couplings do not work, then you may need to dig up and replace the entire hose to fix it.",
