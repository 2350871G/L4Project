Pull out the nut with your hands and discard the shell in a bowl. Most of the time the nut will fall right out when you crack the shell, but you may have to fish around to pull out the nut. Use the same cup, bowl, or bag (if on the go) to collect all of your shells and make cleanup easier. Technically you can eat the shell, but it\u2019s not great for digestion and might be contaminated with pesticides."
