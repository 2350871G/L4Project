  "text":" Making Soy Milk Soak the soybeans in water overnight. Place them in a bowl and cover them with six cups of water. The beans should triple in size. If you want to change the amount of soybeans you're using, just be sure to always use a volume of water three times the volume of the soybeans. Drain the water. When the beans are soft, drain the soaking water from them using the strainer or colander. When they are completely drained, empty the beans into a bowl or other container. Boil 4 quarts of water. Use a large stockpot or dutch oven, so you won't risk having the water and beans boil over the rim. Pulverize the beans.

Line a plastic tofu container with holes through the bottom with a piece of cheesecloth about four times the size of the box. Let the ends drape over the sides of the box. You can use another loosely woven cotton cloth in place of cheesecloth. If you don't have a special tofu box, you can poke holes in a different plastic container. Cook the soy milk.

Fill a large mixing bowl with cold water. Immerse the container of tofu in the bowl of water. Turn it over and gently remove the container. Remove the gauze. The solid block of tofu is now ready to eat. Making Silken Tofu Make a coagulant solution. Stir the nigari into a cup with a few tablespoons of water. Keep stirring until the coagulant has completely dissolved. Add the coagulant to the soy milk. Place both ingredients in a bowl and use a wooden spoon to gently fold them together.
