  "text":" Strawberry Cheesecake Streusel Muffins Preheat your oven to 400\u00baF (204\u00baC).  Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners. If you don't have the liners, grease the pan so the muffins don't stick to it. Make the first part of the muffin batter. To do this, just sift together 2 cups of flour, 2 tsp. of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp. of salt in a medium-sized bowl. Set this bowl aside. Make the second part of the muffin batter. Now, beat 1 cup of whole milk, 1/4 cup of canola oil, one egg, and 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. Combine the two parts of the muffin batter. Pout the milk mixture into the flour mixture and stir the ingredients gently, until the batter is a bit lumpy. Do not overmix it. Make the cheesecake mixture. Beat 4 oz. of cream cheese, 1/3 cup of granulated sugar, 2 tbsp. of a beaten egg, and 1 tsp. of vanilla extract together in a bowl. Mix these ingredients until the mixture is smooth. Make the streusel topping. Mix together 1/4 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1 tsp. of cinnamon. Mix 3 tbsp. of butter into the mixture until it's coarse but blended. Scoop one tbsp. of muffin batter into the bottom of each cupcake liner. Sprinkle a few pieces of sliced strawberries over the batter.  Place 1/2 tbsp. of the cheesecake mixture over the muffin batter for each muffin. Sprinkle the streusel topping over the cheesecake filling.  Place another tbsp. of muffin batter over the cheesecake filling. Add a few strawberries on top of the batter.  Sprinkle the muffins again with the remaining streusel. These layers will create delicious strawberry cheesecake streusel muffins with a layer of cheesecake, strawberries, and streusel in their centers. Bake for 20-25 minutes. After 20 minutes, insert a toothpick to see if it comes out clean. Once it does, the muffins are done. Let the muffins cool on the pan and then transfer them to a wire rack. Serve. Enjoy this tasty treat for breakfast, eat it as a snack, or enjoy it as a dessert. Low Fat Muffins Preheat your oven to 350\u00baF (176\u00baC).  Crack six eggs into a bowl. Whisk the eggs until bubbles form on the surface and the eggs and whites have blended. Pour 3/4 cups of low fat milk into the bowl. Whisk the milk and the whisked eggs together until the ingredients are blended. Heat 2 tbsp. of butter in the microwave. Place the butter in a bowl and cover it to prevent the butter from exploding. Heat it for 30 - 45 seconds, or however long it takes for the butter to melt completely. Carefully pour the melted butter into the bowl. The butter bowl will be hot, so you should use oven mitts or a cloth to pick up the butter bowl to pour the butter into the bowl. Make the flour mix. Pour the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a different bowl. Pour 2 cups of flour, 2 tsp. of baking powder, 1/3 cup of sugar, and 1/4 tsp. of salt into a different bowl. Stir the ingredients until they're incorporated. Pour the egg mix into the flour mix. Mix the egg mix with the flour mix until you've combined the ingredients into a nice thick batter. Add 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds to the mixture. Stir the ingredients some more until the sunflower seeds are evenly blended into the mixture. Place 10-12 muffin cups into a muffin tray. If the batter won't fill all the cups, you can always make another batch. Pour the batter into each cup until they're 2/3 full. The cups should be 2/3 full so the muffins have room to expand as they bake. If you fill them too much, the muffins will crowd each other. Place the tray in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. After this time passes, stick a toothpick into the muffins to see if the insides are solid. If they're still mostly liquid, then bake the muffins for an additional 5 minutes and test them again. If they're still gooey, keep baking them and checking every 2 minutes or so until they're ready. Remove the muffins from the oven. Let them sit for 2-3 minutes to harden. Serve. Enjoy these delicious muffins as part of your breakfast or as a tasty snack during any time of day. Ham and Cheese Muffins Preheat your oven to 425\u00baF (218\u00baC).  Combine the flour and baking soda. Combine 2 cups of self-rising flour and 1/2 tsp. of baking soda together in a bowl. Mix well. Combine the remaining ingredients. Combine 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1/2 cup of finely chopped cooked ham, and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the remaining ingredients. Combine the flour and baking soda with the rest of the ingredients. Stir until the dry ingredients have moistened. Line a 10-12 cup muffin tray with muffin cups. If you don't have muffin cups or don't want to use them, just grease the tray a bit. Fill each cup 2/3 full with batter. This will give the muffins enough room to expand. Bake for 16-18 minutes.
