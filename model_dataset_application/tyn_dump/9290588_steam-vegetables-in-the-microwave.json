If you\u2019re in a hurry, you could fill a bowl with warm water and let the box or bag of frozen veggies soak for about 30 minutes.

If you\u2019ve bought very fresh veggies (e.g. at a farmer\u2019s market), dirt may be caked on the stalks or stems. Use a kitchen scrubbing bad if necessary to remove the dirt. If you\u2019ve thawed frozen, packaged vegetables, they won\u2019t need to be washed. Frozen vegetables are cleaned and cut before they\u2019re packaged."
