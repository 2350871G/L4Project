          "headline":"Select dark meat chicken for its high iron content.",
          "description":"Breastfed babies benefit from eating foods that are rich in iron and zinc. While white chicken meat is leaner, dark meat is a better choice for your baby because it\u2019s higher in iron and antioxidants. Go for a dark meat cut such as chicken thighs or leg quarters. Since most baby formulas are fortified with iron and other important micronutrients, it\u2019s not as important for formula-fed babies to get the additional iron found in dark meat. Ask your pediatrician whether dark meat or white meat is a better choice for your baby. Chicken thighs are also higher in fat compared to the breasts, which makes them more flavorful and easier to puree. You will need 1-2 thighs to make about \u00bd cup (approximately 65 g) of cooked chicken. A single 6 oz (170 g) bone-in, skin-on thigh will yield about 3 ounces (85 g) of meat, but you\u2019ll need more if you\u2019re using small thighs."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Remove any bones and skin from the chicken.",
          "description":"If possible, purchase chicken meat that is already boneless and skinless. If that\u2019s not available, peel off the skin and cut the meat off the bones. Chicken skin does not puree well. If you leave it on, you may end up with large pieces of skin in your puree, which could cause your baby to choke."

        {
          "headline":"Dice the meat into small pieces.",
          "description":"Before you cook the chicken, use a sharp knife to cut it into small cubes or dices. Put the chicken on a cutting board and slice it into strips about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide, then cut across the strips widthwise to make cubes. Putting the chicken in your freezer for 15 minutes before you slice it will make it easier to cut. Always take care when using a sharp knife. Keep your fingertips curled under when holding the chicken in place so you don\u2019t accidentally cut them."

          "headline":"Cover the chicken with water or broth in a saucepan.",
          "description":"Place your diced chicken in a pan and pour in enough water to completely cover the meat. Using broth will give the chicken a richer flavor, but it will also produce its own broth during the cooking process.Tip: If you prefer, you can roast the chicken or cook it in a crock pot instead of poaching it. Keep in mind that you may need to add more liquid to roasted chicken to create a smooth puree."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bring the liquid in the pan to a boil.",

The amount of time this takes will vary depending on how much liquid is in the pan. Check the pan frequently so you don\u2019t lose track and overcook your chicken."

Take care not to overcook the chicken, or it will become tough and chewy."

Using the cooking broth will add flavor and help restore some of the nutrients that were lost during the poaching process.Tip: If your baby hasn\u2019t had chicken before, using the broth might make the flavor too strong.
