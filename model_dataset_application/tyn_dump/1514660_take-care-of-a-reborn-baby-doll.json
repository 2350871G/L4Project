This could include extra diapers, a baby bottle, a changing blanket, and extra pacifiers & extra clothes. You can use these items in the same way you would if you had a child or newborn or toddler. Alternatively, place your reborn essentials into the bottom of your stroller in your diaper bag. Or, you can put them in your reborn\u2019s booster seat in your car and take them for a ride around town or take them for long car rides until they fall asleep just like you would with a newborn or toddler."
