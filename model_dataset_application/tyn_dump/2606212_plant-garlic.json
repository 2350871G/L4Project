Shop online for a wider selection of garlic and choose one to your liking. Some strains are stronger, some are hardy during cold temperatures, and so on. The garlic stocked in grocery stores is often shipped in from faraway places, so it won't necessary be a strain that works with your climate and soil type. Garlic sold in grocery stores has usually been treated with chemicals to make it last longer on the shelf. It's harder to grow treated garlic than untreated garlic."

Garlic overwinters well, and planting it early will cause the bulbs to be larger and more flavorful than a spring-planted crop. However, if you live in a southern area that doesn't have cold winters, plant your garlic early spring instead. If you're planting garlic in the fall, plan to plant it 6 - 8 weeks before the ground freezes. If you're planting garlic in the spring, plant it as soon as the ground can be worked in February or March."
