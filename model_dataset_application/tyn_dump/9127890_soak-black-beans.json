To make sure your bagged beans are safe to eat, spread them out on a baking sheet and sift through them by hand, picking out any small rocks you come across. You don\u2019t want to sink your teeth into one by accident! Most rocks will be light gray in color, which helps them stand out easily from the dark beans."

A standard serving of black beans is about \u00bd cup (75g). Unless you\u2019re fixing mass quantities in bulk, plan on soaking all of the beans at once.

From here, you can decide whether you\u2019d prefer to hot soak or cold soak the beans. A good rule of thumb is to use roughly 2-5 cups (475ml-1L) of water for every cup of dried beans you want to soak. The exact amount you add will depend on the quantity of beans you\u2019re preparing, as well as their size.

If you\u2019re using a bowl, you can heat the water in a tea kettle first, then pour it over the top of the dried beans. Black beans will typically need 1-4 hours for a proper hot soak. Smaller servings (between 2-4 cups, or 300-600g) shouldn\u2019t require much time, whereas a big batch may need to sit longer in order to fully soften up.

Set a timer to remind yourself to drain the beans once they\u2019re finished soaking. Move the beans to the refrigerator while they soak if space in your kitchen is at a premium.
