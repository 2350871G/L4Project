  "text":" Drawing the Circles Cut a piece of watercolor paper into a square. Tear off a piece of watercolor paper, which is sturdy enough to withstand watercolor and acrylic paint. Measure the size of your paper and use a ruler to cut it into a square if it's a rectangle. For example, if your paper is 12 by 16 inches (30 cm \u00d7 41 cm), cut it down to 12 by 12 inches (30 cm \u00d7 30 cm). If you can't find watercolor paper, use paper that's designed to withstand paint, such as canvas paper. Make a dot in the center of the paper. Lay a ruler horizontally on the center of the square and make a small mark in the middle using a pencil. Then, turn the ruler vertically so it's lined up with your mark and make a small dot in the center. The small dot will be the center of your color wheel. Use a compass to make a small circle 2 \u20442 inches (6.4 cm) away from the center. Attach a pencil to a drawing compass and stick the other leg of the compass on the center dot. Extend the pencil leg of the compass so it's about 2 \u20442 inches (6.4 cm) from the dot. Then, slowly rotate the compass to make a small circle.Variation: To make a simple 12-color color wheel, just draw the large outer circle for the color wheel and don't make the smaller circles within it. If you don't have a drawing compass or don't need your color wheel to be precise, you can draw the circle freehand. Make another circle that's 5 \u20442 inches (14 cm) from the center dot. To create another row for your color wheel, make a slightly larger circle beyond the small one you just made. Adjust your compass so it's 5 \u20442 inches (14 cm) from the dot and rotate it to make a circle. Draw the outer circle 8 \u20442 inches (22 cm) from the center. Move the leg of your drawing compass so it extends 8 \u20442 inches (22 cm) from the middle of the color wheel and draw the largest circle. This will be the border for your color wheel. You should now have 3 rings for the color wheel that you'll divide into spaces. Dividing and Labeling the 12 Spaces Write the numbers 1 through 12 clockwise around the outside of the wheel. Use your pencil to write 12 at the top of the outer ring and 6 near the bottom of the ring. Fill in the rest of the numbers so they're evenly spaced just like on a clock.
