While fennel is not known to be especially slippery, it is still a wise idea to hold it still on a resistant surface to prevent it from slipping away under your grasp. A silicone cutting board works especially well, but a standard wood cutting board can work well, too. Avoid slippery glass dishes or stone countertops."

          "description":"Cut away the stalks and wispy fronds by slicing them off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the bulb. The stalks and fronds can be discarded, but they contain a lot of flavor, so you should consider using them for other purposes and in other dishes. Fronds can be used as a garnish. Stalks can be saved and added to fish stock. If you decide to save the stalks and fronds, cut the bright green, wispy fronds off of each stalk. Discard any wilted, browning fronds or brown stalks. Rinse the fronds in cool water and pat dry with paper towels. Place them in resealable plastic bags or plastic wrap until ready to use."

To remove the outer layer with a vegetable peeler, hold the bulb steady in one hand with the cut top end facing your palm and the root end exposed. Pass the vegetable peeler down and around the outside perimeter of the bulb from top end to bottom end in even strokes."

Hold the fennel down on its side with your non-dominant hand. Keep the knife in your dominant hand. Discard the root once removed. It is not generally saved for use in other dishes."
