          "description":"Choose a high-quality dark chocolate, as this will be the main flavor of your finished souffl\u00e9. Chop 6 ounces (170 g) chocolate into small pieces and transfer to a bowl with 1 tablespoon (15g) butter and 2 tablespoons (30ml) freshly-brewed coffee. As you'll be adding extra sugar to the souffl\u00e9 later on, you should choose a dark, bittersweet chocolate to prevent your souffl\u00e9 from being too sweet. A high-quality dark chocolate with around 70% cacao will work excellently for this. The chocolate base is where all of the flavor for the souffl\u00e9 comes from, with the lightness coming from the meringue that is folded in. You can prepare the base ahead of time and store it in the fridge for a few hours until you need to use it."

          "headline":"Melt the chocolate mixture over a double-boiler.",
          "description":"Fill the bottom of a saucepan with around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water and bring it to a slight simmer. Put the glass bowl with the chocolate over the saucepan, making sure to keep the bottom of the bowl out of the water. Let the chocolate melt and combine with the other ingredients, stirring occasionally until smooth. Using a double-boiler will apply a very slight heat to your chocolate, which will prevent it from burning. If you can't make a double-boiler, you could also melt the chocolate in a microwave on a very low setting. Heat it for 20 to 30 seconds at a time, stirring often until the mixture is melted."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Stir in the vanilla extract and egg yolks.",
          "description":"Pour 2 teaspoons (10ml) of vanilla extract into the melted chocolate mixture, stirring until it is fully incorporated. Take the chocolate off the heat and beat in the yolks of 3 large eggs, saving the egg whites for the meringue. Once everything is fully combined, place the bowl back on the double-boiler and turn the heat as low as it can go. The vanilla extract will complement the flavor of the chocolate, rather than overpowering it. Let the chocolate cool slightly before adding the egg yolks to stop them from cooking. For extra caution, combine a little of the chocolate mixture with the egg yolks before adding them to the remaining mixture. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling. Leaving the chocolate base sitting over the double-boiler will keep it just warm enough to stop the chocolate and butter from solidifying, without cooking the egg yolks. You can leave the chocolate base sitting here while you work on the meringue."

        {
          "headline":"Whip the egg whites and salt in a new bowl until soft and airy.",
          "description":"In a different bowl, use a whisk or electric beater to begin whipping 5 egg whites and 1 teaspoon (5g) of salt into a soft meringue. Beat them only until they begin taking in some air, become white in color, and the whole mixture looks lighter. Use the leftover egg whites from the eggs used to make the chocolate base. The two egg yolks you have left over when making the meringue can be used to make custard to serve alongside your souffl\u00e9. You should stop whipping the egg whites just before they get to the soft peak stage. This step is only to lighten the egg whites before slowly incorporating the sugar, in order to make a light and smooth meringue."

          "description":"Once the egg whites are light and airy, you can begin incorporating 7 tablespoons (85g) of sugar. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar to the egg whites, beating them until the sugar is fully incorporated. Repeat this process until all of the sugar has been mixed in and your meringue forms stiff peaks. A meringue that has \u201cstiff peaks\u201d will be able to stand up straight on its own. Lift the whisk or electric beater up and out of the meringue and observe the peaks that form. If they droop over back into the meringue, they are soft peaks. If they stand up straight and only drop slightly, they're stiff peaks and your meringue is ready."

        {
          "headline":"Stir 1/3 of the meringue mixture into the chocolate base.",
          "description":"Use a rubber spatula or a large wooden spoon to transfer around 1/3 of the meringue mixture to the bowl containing the chocolate base. Stir the meringue and chocolate together until the chocolate becomes lighter, in both color and texture, and the two are fully combined. This will help add some air into the chocolate before you mix in the rest of the meringue, making it much easier to combine the two while keeping the mixture light and airy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Fold the remaining meringue into the chocolate.",
          "description":"Transfer the rest of the egg whites to the chocolate bowl. Use long, slow strokes with a rubber spatula or large wooden spoon to the lift the chocolate up and fold the egg whites into it. Keep folding the egg whites into the chocolate until they are just combined. If you overmix your souffl\u00e9 batter, you'll knock out a lot of the air and stop the souffl\u00e9s from rising fully. Mix just until you don't see any streaks of egg white left in the chocolate mixture."
