Server hacking (packet hacking) is against the law in some countries, since those packets and servers are the property of the company. If you hack the servers, it is just the company policy on third party hacking tools. You can find the policy under Support. Some people consider that hacking is a little pointless and takes away from the experience of the game. They believe that there is no point in hacking, as it does not make the hacker any better at game play."
