Generally a larger plastic bottle is more suitable (see next). Keep the lid on the bottle for the moment. Using the Exacto knife, cut out the base of the plastic bottle. This is the part of the shade that will hang downward. Insert the globe into the bottle to ensure that it fits without touching the sides anywhere. If it doesn't fit, find a larger plastic bottle.

It's important to make adjustments as you go because once the glue has dried, the spoon heads are there for good.
