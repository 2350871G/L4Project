For bronze welding, you\u2019ll use a bronze rod, but these rods come in varieties with differing amounts of copper, aluminum, and other metals. Ideally, you want to match the composition of the rod you use to the metal you\u2019re welding and the thickness of the weld you need. For example, a bronze rod with 10% aluminum is good for close-fitting joints, but a bronze rod with 7% tin is good for welding dissimilar and unknown metals. Welding rods are thicker than brazing rods. Brazing rods look very narrow because they\u2019re used to leave only a line of bronze on metal."

If you are using an oxyacetylene torch, you\u2019ll need flux to protect metal against oxides."
