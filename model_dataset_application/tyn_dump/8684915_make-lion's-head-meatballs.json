Bring the pot of noodles and water to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat. Once the water and noodles reach a boil, you will need to turn off the stove. Place a lid over the pot. Let the noodle soften. After you cover the pot of noodles, you will need to let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Allowing the noodles to sit in the hot water will soften them. Drain the noodles.

Making the Meatballs Oil a baking sheet. You will need to create a space for the meatballs to rest once you prepare them. A large baking sheet works well for this purpose. Lightly oil the large baking sheet and set aside. If you don\u2019t have a large baking sheet, you can oil a large cutting board or platter instead. Combine the meatball ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, combine the white pepper, wine, ginger, green onions, water chestnuts, and pork. Then add two teaspoons of the salt and one tablespoon of the soy sauce. Use your hands to thoroughly combine the ingredients. Form the meatballs. Once you have combined the meatball ingredients, you will use your hands to shape the meatballs.

Take several paper towels and use them to line a large plate. You can also use a large platter or another baking sheet lined with paper towels. Heat the oil. Place a thin layer of oil in the bottom of a large skillet. Position the skillet on the stove. Turn the heat to high and allow the oil to heat up for about one minute. Place the meatballs in a single layer in the skillet. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to position the meatballs in the bottom of the skillet. Make sure you do not overcrowd the meatballs.

Quarter the leaves of the cabbage lengthwise. Then cut each leaf horizontally into thirds. Set the cabbage aside. Add the cabbage and salt. After simmering the meatballs for 5 minutes, add the cut up cabbage leaves. Then add one teaspoon of salt to the broth. Cover the saucepan with a tight fitting lid and cook for 10 more minutes.
