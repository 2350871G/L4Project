          "description":"Heat 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of oil in a large pan over low heat. Once the oil is hot, add 2 sausages to the pan. After 10 minutes, turn the heat up to medium and cook the sausages for an additional 5 minutes. Once they\u2019re done, either push them to the side of the pan to keep them warm, or transfer them to a hot plate. If you use really thin sausages, they may not take as long to cook. You can check the doneness by cutting the sausage in half. If there is still red, raw meat inside, it needs several more minutes on the stove."

        {
          "headline":"Fry the bacon in the same pan as the sausage.",
          "description":"Add 2 to 3 slices of bacon to the already-hot pan. Cook them for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are as crispy as you prefer. When they\u2019re done, either set them to the side of the pan with the sausage, or put them on the hot plate. A longer cook time will produce crispier bacon. Back bacon is recommended for a truly authentic fry-up, but you can use whatever kind you like best\u2014even turkey bacon, if you\u2019re trying to be a little more heart healthy."

          "description":"Add your beans to the pan and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they\u2019re hot all the way through. Use canned beans to save time, or make your own baked beans from scratch ahead of time. Once the beans are hot, move them to the side of the pan or to a hot plate. Beans are a very common (and, often said, essential) part of a classic full English breakfast. You can add the beans to toast, eat them alongside the meats, or enjoy them on their own. Though if you don\u2019t like beans, you don\u2019t have to include them."

Sprinkle the tomatoes with salt and pepper, and place them onto the hot pan. Cook them for about 2 minutes per side. Push the tomatoes to the side or add them to a hot plate when they\u2019re done. The acidity from the tomatoes is a really important part of the flavor profile of an English breakfast. It cuts through the richness and fattiness of the rest of the dish."

If the pan is a bit dry, add \u20442 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of soft butter to the pan and let it melt. Fry the bread on each side for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bread is brown and toasty. Set the finished toast off to the side when it\u2019s done. The fried bread will be pretty rich from the fat and grease, so you\u2019ll probably just want one slice, though you can make more if you so desire."

Crack the eggs directly into the pan, and cook them for 30 to 60 seconds. Spoon melted butter and grease overtop of the eggs as they cook to baste them and infuse them with more flavor.
