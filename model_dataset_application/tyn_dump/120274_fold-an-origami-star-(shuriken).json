Fold the top right hand corner diagonally down so the top of the paper lines up with the left side, forming a point at the top right corner. Remove the extra piece. Cut or carefully tear along the edge so you are left with a square of paper. Forming the Parts Fold the square in half. The fold should be parallel to the edges. Cut the square in half.
