The question has been asked 1,000 times, whether it's ok to paint latex over oil, or oil over latex. The answer depends on who you ask, but the bottom line is this: properly prepped, you can paint anything over anything. Prepare your surface properly by cleaning and sanding and cleaning again, then apply a primer.The key is making sure that the surface that is being primed doesn't have a gloss, as paint\u2014especially latex, will not stick to a glossy base, and  you'll have a much harder job to do in fairly short order.

Use a brush. Using a high-quality brush, apply new paint (or varnish) within the time limit specified in the directions.
