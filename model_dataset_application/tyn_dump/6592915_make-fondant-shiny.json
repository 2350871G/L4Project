          "description":"Pour 1 part light corn syrup and 1 part clear alcohol into a little dish or shallow cup. Mix them well to fully combine the corn syrup (which will make the glaze shiny) with the alcohol (which will allow the glaze the harden as it dries). Warning: If you plan to use this technique, don\u2019t knead your fondant with fats (such as shortening or oil) or use tools or surfaces that have come into contact with oils or fats. Fats can cause this glaze to separate and create a bubbled or uneven surface, rather than one that is smooth and shiny. Use cornstarch instead. Using alcohol and corn syrup will give your fondant a permanent, high gloss shine. The exact amount will vary depending on the amount of fondant you need to glaze, but using 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of each component will usually work well for small decorations. Use alcohol that is 150 proof or higher. Vodka works well, but clear grain alcohols are also effective. If you prefer not to use alcohol, you can substitute vanilla extract or imitation vanilla extract for the alcohol."

          "headline":"Brush the mixture onto the fondant with a pastry brush.",
          "description":"Use a pastry brush to easily and evenly apply the glaze to the fondant you\u2019d like to make shiny. For small elements, you\u2019ll want to use a small, soft brush. To cover an entire cake, a medium or large-sized brush will be much more efficient. However, skip overly stiff brushes and don\u2019t press too hard to avoid creating indentations on the fondant. It's best to apply the glaze in thin layers. Thicker coats will create a shinier appearance, but they will also take longer to dry. It can be difficult to apply this glaze to large areas quickly enough, as it tends to set quickly. Stick to small decorations or tackle larger projects in sections."

          "description":"Depending on the batch, your climate, and the thickness of the glaze, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight to fully dry. Avoid brushing over the glazed area or touching it with your fingers once the glaze starts setting. You can easily leave marks in the glaze during this stage, and those marks will be permanent. Once the glaze dries, the shine is permanent\u2014no need to reapply another coat before serving."

Be careful not to press too hard or you\u2019ll create indentations on the surface of the fondant. This technique will give your fondant a satiny finish. If you want to keep your fingers clean, try using vegetable cooking spray. Hold the nozzle approximately 4 inches (10 cm) away from the fondant and lightly mist it over the surface at even intervals. To keep from touching a cake you\u2019re serving to friends or clients, you can brush the shortening or oil on with a pastry brush or wear food-safe gloves. Shortening and oil will both go smoothly over both dry and oily fondants. Since they are both relatively colorless, they\u2019re safe to use over white fondant without risking discoloration."

          "description":"Once you\u2019ve applied the layer of fat, you can use a paper towel or regular towel to buff the fondant. This will remove any excess shortening or oil and buff away irregularities, fingerprints, or other marks, giving the cake a nice, smooth finish. Work in small, circular strokes and press lightly to avoid marking the fondant. Any irregularities, fingerprints, or stroke marks should fade as you buff the fondant. Press lightly, however, to avoid leaving any indentations."

Although it will still have a nice, satiny appearance, you\u2019ll need to apply another coat to bring it back to its original sheen.Since shortening and oil never dry completely, it's easy to accidentally leave fingerprints and other marks while moving the cake. You can remove these marks before presenting the piece by lightly buffing them out with a dry paper towel."
