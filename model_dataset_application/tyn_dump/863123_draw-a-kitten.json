    "Use any color you'd like, but make the mouth area slightly lighter so that it stands out.",
    "If you added stripes or patterns, color those a separate shade, as well.",
    "Sketching a Realistic Kitten Sleeping Sketch a circle for the head and an oval for the body.",
    "Position them close together; some overlap may even be good.",
    "Draw a curved line connecting the body and the head.",
    "The body should only be a slight oval, and only slightly larger than the head.",
    "The connecting line should reach the approximate middle top of both the head and the body.",
    "Sketch a circle for the mouth area and a curved line for the tail.",
    "The mouth should be a small circle positioned at the bottom of the head, slightly overlapping the body oval, as well.",
    "The tail should begin near the back of the body oval, and should follow along the natural curve of the kitten toward the animal's face.",
    "Sketch the ears.",
    "The ears should be triangles coming off the top of the kitten's head.",
    "Since the kitten is sleeping, the bottom ear should be relatively flat/horizontal, while the top ear should be angled upward and away from the body.",
    "Note that the ears should be approximately the same size as the mouth section of the kitten's face.",
    "Add the eyes and the nose.",
    "The nose should be a small half-circle sitting at the edge of the mouth area.",
    "The eyes should be small, straight dashes crossing behind the mouth area and over a small portion of the face.",
    "Since the kitten is sleeping, use lines to represent closed eyes instead of circles, which indicate open eyes.",
    "Add the thigh as a circle.",
    "Make it about as big as the head, and position it slightly off-center yet overlapping the body.",
    "The thigh should just barely brush against the bottom of the mouth area.",
    "Draw the basic outline of the kitten.",
    "Widen and fill out the tail.",
    "Darken the top edge of the thigh, as well as the lines smoothing out the connections between the body, head, and ears.",
    "Erase the draft lines.",
    "Add more details like the detail of the ears and fur lines.",
    "Consider adding thin triangular stripes or other patterns to the fur.",
    "Color the kitten.",
    "Use any color desired.",
    "Note that the nose should be a different color, as should the top ear, since you'll be viewing the inner ear (this does not apply to the bottom ear; you'll see the outer furry portion of that one).",
    "If you added stripes or other details, color those separate shades, as well."
