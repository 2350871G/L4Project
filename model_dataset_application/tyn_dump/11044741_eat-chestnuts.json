To make sure that you have an edible chestnut, inspect the shell. If the shell is prickly and rough, it's a standard chestnut. If it's smooth and easy to handle, it's probably a horse chestnut. Another way to check for horse chestnuts is to smell them. Horse chestnuts have a bitter odor, while a regular chestnut smells sweet and nutty."

Then, put it in your hand and find the opening where you cut it or split it with a nut cracker. While holding it between both hands, use your two thumbs to pull the edges of each half of the shell. Pull each shell away from one another until the shell cracks in half. If you're removing the shell immediately after cooking them, your chestnuts will still be hot. Hold each individual chestnut in a clean towel with both hands and then crack it, using the towel to keep your hands from getting burned."
