  "text":" Making the Frame Remove the glass and back from a picture frame. Set the backing and glass aside; you will not need them for this project. You can also use a backless frame instead. If you can't find a frame, you can use an embroidery hoop instead. If you were able to find a framed screen meant for paper making, you can skip this section and start making the paper pulp. Cut a piece of window screen down to fit the frame. Measure the entire frame, including the outside edges. Cut a piece of window screening down to fit those measurements. If you can't find window screening, you can use another type of stiff, mesh screening. Do not use tulle or mesh fabric. It is too soft. The mesh must be finely woven. If the holes are too big, the paper will fall through. Secure the screen to the back of your frame. Turn your frame over so that the back is facing you. Place the screen on top of the frame. Secure it with nails, tacks, or stables. Trim off any excess screening. Consider wrapping duct tape around the back edges of the frame. This will prevent the screen's sharp edges from accidentally scratching you. Place an old towel into a shallow pan or tray. This will help soak up any excess water. Make sure it's one you don't mind possibly ruining. Sometimes, paper can leak out dyes. Set the frame on top of the towel. Make sure that the screen side (the back part) of the frame is facing down. You want the front of the frame to form a rim around your screen. Making the Paper Tear your paper into small pieces. Choose plain, non-glossy paper, such as printer paper, construction paper, newsprint, and paper napkins. Tear the paper into \u00bd to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) scraps. How much paper you use depends on how many cards you want to make. Soak the paper in boiled water for 10 to 15 minutes. Place the shredded paper into a mixing bowl. Cover the paper with boiled water. Wait 10 to 15 minutes, then give it a stir. If you don't have colored paper, but want to make it colored, stir in a few drops of food coloring into the water first.

Stir a few spoonfuls of your favorite type of seed. Choose seeds that are small and flat, such as: forget-me-not, poppy, or herbs.

Use your fingers to spread the paper around into a rough rectangular shape. If you wish to make shaped cards, such as hearts, place a cookie cutter on the screen first, then fill it with about 1 tablespoon of the pulp. Use your fingers to smooth the paper out. If you used cookie cutters, make sure that you smooth the pulp until it fills the entire bottom of the cookie cutter. How thick you make the paper is up to you. Keep in mind that the thicker it is, the longer it will take to dry. If it takes too long to dry, there's a chance your seeds could sprout or get ruined. Press the pulp with a towel or sponge to remove excess moisture. If you used a cookie cutter, wrap a towel around your finger first, then gently press the pulp inside the cookie cutter. Once you have most of the water drained, remove the cookie cutter. If the towel under the screen becomes too soggy, replace it with a fresh one.

Leave some space between each \"card.\" Transfer the screen to a well-ventilated area. Take the screen out of the baking dish; leave the towel behind.

You can help speed up the process by putting the screen near a heat source, such as a heater or sunny window. Make sure that air can flow under the rack. Carefully peel the paper off of the screen. If the underside is still damp, flip the paper over, and let it finish drying. Your paper is now ready to turn into beautiful cards. Making the Cards Fold a sheet of cardstock in half widthwise. This will make the base for your card. Choose a color that works well with you paper. You can also use a blank card, with nothing written or printed on it. Cut or trim the handmade seeded paper down. The seeded paper you just made will eventually go on the front of your card. If you make a rectangular sheet of paper, you can cut it down into smaller shapes using a pair of scissors.
