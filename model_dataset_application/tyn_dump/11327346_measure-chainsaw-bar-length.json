          "description":"Set your chainsaw down on a flat surface so the handle is face up. Locate the screws or bolts holding the top cover on the chainsaw's body and use either a screwdriver or wrench to loosen them. Look for a black wire plugging into a circular port under the cover, and pull the wire out of the port to disconnect power from the spark plug. Don't measure the bar length while the spark plug wire is still attached to prevent the saw from starting while you're working on it. The location of the screws or bolts may vary depending on the chainsaw model you have."

Round the measurement to the nearest inch to know the cutting length of your bar. For example, if the measurement you took is 13 \u20448 inches (35 cm), then the cutting length is 14 inches (36 cm). The cutting length may also be referred to as the called length, usable length, or effective length. The average cutting lengths on most chainsaws are 14 inches (36 cm), 16 inches (41 cm), 18 inches (46 cm), and 20 inches (51 cm)."

Once you take off the nuts, pull the cover straight off of the chainsaw to expose the rest of the bar. Move the bar forward so it releases from the clutch before pulling it off of the bolts. If your chainsaw has a brake, make sure it's in the locked position before removing the clutch cover. Otherwise, it will be difficult to put back on.Tip: Wear work gloves if you still have a chain on the saw so you don't accidentally cut yourself."
