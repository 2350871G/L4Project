As you do so, you will gain points. The winner of Carcassonne is the player who has the most points when all of the game tiles have been used. Place the starting tile. Every game of Carcassonne begins by placing the starting tile in the center of your playing space. The back of this tile looks different from all of the rest of the tiles, so it should be easy to find. Use a large table or other playing space to play Carcassonne because the tiles will sprawl out quite a bit. Prepare the scorecard. To start the game, every player puts one meeple on the scorecard. As the game progresses and players earn points, they will move their meeples to indicate how many points they have. Each player is responsible for his or her own points. Shuffle and place the remaining tiles face down. Players will need to draw tiles at random to place them on the board and continue to expand it.
