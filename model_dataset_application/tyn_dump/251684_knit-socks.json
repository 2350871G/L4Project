Wrap the yarn around pegs 1 through 12, but do not go beyond peg 12. Then, lift the bottom loop of the yarn up and over the top of each peg to knit. Repeat this for 4 rows. Decrease and repeat for the next 6 rows. To decrease on the loom, start each row by lifting 1 loop off the first peg and placing it onto the peg next to it.

When you are finished, look for 3 empty pegs on either side of the remaining heel stitches (pegs 4 through 9). Pick up the stitches from the sides of the heel. Place 1 of each of these stitches onto an empty peg. Use your hook to lift up the stitches that you have taken off of the pegs and put them back onto the empty pegs. For example, place 1 stitch onto pegs 1 through 3 and 10 through 12. Then, place 2 stitches on pegs 4, 9, 13, and 24. Knit and repeat until the foot portion of the sock is the desired length. Once all of the stitches are back on the loom, wrap the yarn around each of the pegs in the loom. Lift the bottom loop (or the 2 bottom loops if there are 2) up and over the top loop to knit. Continue to knit until the sock is the desired length. You can measure the length against an existing sock, or put your foot through the loom to check the length.

Repeat until the sock is completely sewn up and then tie off the last stitch and cut the excess yarn. Make your second sock in the same way. Using 2 Straight Knitting Needles Make a slipknot to start the cast on row. Loop the yarn around your index and middle finger twice. Pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, tug on the tail of the yarn to tighten the base of the slipknot. Slide the loop off your fingers and onto 2 knitting needles held together. Tug the tail again to tighten the slipknot around them. The slipknot counts as your first cast on stitch. Make sure to use a medium-weight yarn for knitting on 2 needles. Cast on 36 stitches while holding 2 needles together. This will result in a looser cast on stitches and help to ensure that the socks will be large enough to fit over your feet. Form a loop of yarn with your fingers, pinch and twist it 1 time at the base, and then slide it onto the 2 knitting needles. Repeat until you have a total of 36 cast on stitches. Work in the rib stitch for 2 in (5.1 cm). Knit 1 and then purl 1 stitch going all the way across the row to work in the rib stitch. Then, reverse the pattern going back across the row. The rib stitch will make the top of your sock stretchy, which will help to keep it in place. Knit until the sock is the desired length. You can make the sock as long or as short as you like. Measure it against your foot or against an existing sock to determine when the sock is long enough. For example, you could make an ankle sock, a mid-calf sock, or a knee-length sock. Bind off the last row. When you have finished your sock, knit 2 stitches to start casting off. Then, lift the first stitch up and over the second stitch. Knit 1 again and lift up and over again. Continue to knit 1 and lift 1 up and over the new stitch. Repeat this to the end of the row. Sew up the seam to close the toe and side of the sock. To complete your sock, leave a tail that is about 24 in (61 cm) after you finish binding off. Then, thread this yarn through a yarn needle. Fold the rectangular piece in half lengthwise and begin sewing from the corner of the toe. Sew all the way across the toe, and then down the length of the side of the sock. Tie off the end of the yarn and cut the excess to secure your sock. Do not sew across the sock opening! Knitting With Circular Needles Use a pair of US size 1 (2.25 mm) 9 in (23 cm) cable needles to cast on 64 stitches.Make a slipknot and place it onto the right-hand needle for your first cast on stitch. Loop your working yarn over your left-hand needle. Then, insert your right-hand needle into the loop. Yarn over again and pull the yarn through the loop. Repeat until you have 64 total stitches. This is the ideal number of stitches for a medium-sized pair of socks for an adult, but you can cast on 8 more for larger socks or 8 less for smaller socks. Opt for a fingering or sock weight yarn to make socks on US size 1 (2.25 mm) circular needles. How to Choose the Best Yarn for Socks\nOpt for a fluffy yarn if you want socks that are soft and plush.

Repeat this for each round until the cuff measures 4.5 in (11 cm). Knit for 6 in (15 cm). After you finish knitting the cuff, begin working the leg and ankle portion of the sock. Knit all of the rounds until the body of the sock measures 6 in (15 cm). You may use a different stitch if desired, but the knit stitch is the easiest option.

Work decreases to shape the foot portion of the sock. Knit 2 and then knit 2 together until you are back to the original number of stitches in the round.

Knit 2 to start binding off the round. Then, lift the first stitch up and over the second stitch. Knit 1 again and lift up and over again. Continue to knit 1 and lift 1 up and over. Sew up the end of the sock. Leave a 12 in (30 cm) tail and thread the end of it through the eye of a yarn needle. Then, turn the sock inside out and sew up the toe. Hold together the stitches at the end of the toe and sew through 2 stitches at a time to secure the end of the sock. Tie the end of the yarn through the last stitch and cut the excess to finish the sock. Repeat the process to make a second sock.",

    "Knit for 6 in (15 cm).",
    "After you finish knitting the cuff, begin working the leg and ankle portion of the sock.",
    "Knit all of the rounds until the body of the sock measures 6 in (15 cm).",
    "You may use a different stitch if desired, but the knit stitch is the easiest option.",
    "Shape the heel of the sock by working short rows.",

    "Place another stitch marker after the 29th purl stitch.",
    "Repeat the knit 3 and purl 29 row a total of 28 times.",
    "Pick up stitches to complete the round.",
    "After you have finished working across the heel rows, use the end of your needle to pick up the stitches along the sides of the heel.",
    "Insert your right-hand needle into the first stitch on the edge of the heel portion of your socks.",
    "Then, loop the yarn over the end of the needle and pull this loop through the stitch.",
    "Continue to do this until you have picked up all of the stitches on 1 side of the heel.",
    "Then, knit until you get to the other side of the heel and pick up these stitches in the same way.",
    "Work decreases to shape the foot portion of the sock.",
    "Knit 2 and then knit 2 together until you are back to the original number of stitches in the round.",
    "To knit 2 together, insert your right-hand needle into the first 2 stitches in the round.",
    "Then, yarn over, and pull through both stitches.",
    "As an example, if you have 100 stitches in the round and need to get back to 64, knit 2 and then knit 2 together until the total number of stitches in the round equals 64 again.",
    "Knit until the foot portion of the sock is the desired length and bind off.",
    "Measure the sock against an existing sock or against your foot.",
