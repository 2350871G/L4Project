If you prefer a milder flavor, add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of syrup. For a stronger flavor, use 3 or 4 Tbsp (45 or 60 ml). When in doubt, start with a smaller amount and add more later. Flavors like vanilla, raspberry, peach, and hazelnut are popular, but you can use any flavored syrup you want. Commercial syrups come in a wide variety of flavors. You can even combine flavors. For example, mix equal parts raspberry syrup and almond syrup for a raspberry-almond blend. Combine equal parts banana syrup and Irish cream syrup to create a banana cream pie Italian soda. Create \"tiger's blood\" Italian soda by combining equal parts strawberry syrup and coconut syrup."

When using commercial syrups packaged in a pump bottle, adding two to four pumps of syrup usually provides the right amount of flavor. If you've made standard Italian soda before, use the same amount of syrup for an Italian cream (French) soda. If you're starting with this drink, then you'll need to experiment a little. Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) for a milder flavor and up to 4 Tbsp (60 ml) for a stronger, sweeter taste. Use any syrup flavor you want. For a twist, you can even combine syrup flavors. Add equal parts of both syrups when combining two flavors. Some combinations that work well include: banana and Irish cream, strawberry and coconut, raspberry and almond, and peach and vanilla."

Do not stir the contents of the glass too much since doing so can cause the soda to become flat. Only stir the French soda a few times, just enough to spread the half and half through the top two-thirds to three-quarters of the glass. For a slightly different variation, add the half and half before adding the club soda. Adding the half and half after the soda is more traditional and allows the half and half to spread gradually, creating a smoother drink. Adding the half and half before adding the soda will create a foamier beverage. If you don't have half and half, combine equal parts heavy cream and whole milk. Stir the two ingredients together in a separate dish before adding the mixture to the glass. Use almond milk if you need a dairy-free alternative to half and half."
