Be sure to open a window as well. Keep a spray bottle filled with vinegar handy. If you spill the lye water on you, rinse it off with water, then spray it with the vinegar. This will neutralize the lye. If you spill the lye elsewhere, it would still be a good idea to neutralize it with vinegar first, before you wipe it off."

When it comes to soap making, you have to measure everything by weight. Use only distilled or demineralized water. Don\u2019t use water from the tap or filtered water, as the minerals may react with the lye. The water must be cool\u2014not warm or hot. It will heat up considerably once you add the lye into it.

The lye should be around 100 to 125 \u00b0F (38 to 52 \u00b0C) by the time you are ready to add the oils into it. Use a soap making thermometer to keep track of the temperature."

Whether or not you have to prepare your mold depends on what kind of mold you are using. Loaf or rectangular-shaped soap molds need to be lined with parchment paper or wax paper. Decorative molds for individual bars of soap typically don\u2019t need any preparation, although you could spray them with mold release made for soap-making.

Pour all of the oils into a stainless steel pot as you finish weighing them. Don\u2019t add these oils to the pot with the lye water in it. Use a second pot.

Rose clay is great for soap because of its absorbent qualities. Other clays that you can use include:\nBentonite clay, which is light green. It's very absorbent, making it an excellent choice for oily skin. It's also slippery, which makes it good for shaving. Kaolin clay is a mild, white clay. Its fluffy texture will give you creamy, silky soap. Rhassoul clay, which is light brown in color. It's good for exfoliating and absorbing oils from skin."

If you choose to use a combination of 2 or more fragrances, make sure that the total amount is 0.5 ounces (14 g). Rose geranium, jasmine, ylang ylang, and sandalwood combined pair wonderfully with the pink color of rose clay soap. If you prefer a simpler option, peppermint is a classic choice.

If you don\u2019t do this, the soap may develop cracks in its surface. Don\u2019t just stop at 1 blanket; use several! The heavier and thicker, the better. Consider covering your soap with a sheet of plastic wrap first. This will not only help trap the heat further, but also help keep your blanket clean."

Other molds must be taken apart first. If the soap feels soft after you take the blanket off, let it sit for a couple of hours. Keep the soap in the warm, dry place during these 24 to 48 hours. If you covered your soap with a sheet of plastic wrap in addition to the blanket, be sure to peel that off as well."

A special slicer made for soap making would be ideal, but you can also use any sharp, non-serrated knife. Skip this step if you poured the soap into individual soap molds. It\u2019s already the right size."

About once per week, rotate the soap bars so that they cure evenly on each side. This may sound like a long time, but it's very important; although the soap is solid, the lye is still caustic and can burn your skin. Keep the soap in a warm, dry place throughout this period. This is key to helping the soap cure properly. The soap will be cured and useable within 4 weeks, but it will be harsh and drying. The longer you let it cure, however, the milder it will become."

    "Rose clay is great for soap because of its absorbent qualities.",
    "Other clays that you can use include:\nBentonite clay, which is light green.",
    "It's very absorbent, making it an excellent choice for oily skin.",
    "It's also slippery, which makes it good for shaving.",
    "Kaolin clay is a mild, white clay.",
    "Its fluffy texture will give you creamy, silky soap.",
    "Rhassoul clay, which is light brown in color.",
    "It's good for exfoliating and absorbing oils from skin.",
    "Stir in 0.5 ounces (14 g) of essential oil, if desired.",
    "You can use a combination of fragrances, or you can use just 1 fragrance.",
    "If you choose to use a combination of 2 or more fragrances, make sure that the total amount is 0.5 ounces (14 g).",
    "Rose geranium, jasmine, ylang ylang, and sandalwood combined pair wonderfully with the pink color of rose clay soap.",
    "If you prefer a simpler option, peppermint is a classic choice.",
    "You can also try lavender essential oil too.",
    "Pouring and Curing the Soap Pour the soap into your prepared soap molds.",
    "Use a silicone spatula to help guide the soap into the molds.",
    "Gently tap the mold against the counter to help settle any air bubbles.",
    "The soap is still caustic at this point, so you should continue to wear your safety gear.",
    "Move the soap into a warm, dry place, then cover it with a blanket.",
    "Covering soap with a blanket may sound silly, but it\u2019s actually very important to keep the soap warm as it cures.",
    "If you don\u2019t do this, the soap may develop cracks in its surface.",
    "Don\u2019t just stop at 1 blanket; use several!",
    "The heavier and thicker, the better.",
    "Consider covering your soap with a sheet of plastic wrap first.",
    "This will not only help trap the heat further, but also help keep your blanket clean.",
    "Wait 24 to 48 hours, then demold the soap.",
    "Remove the blanket first, then take the soap out of the mold.",
    "How you do this depends on what type of mold you are using.",
    "Some molds can be inverted, like a cake pan.",
    "Other molds must be taken apart first.",
    "If the soap feels soft after you take the blanket off, let it sit for a couple of hours.",
    "Keep the soap in the warm, dry place during these 24 to 48 hours.",
    "If you covered your soap with a sheet of plastic wrap in addition to the blanket, be sure to peel that off as well.",
    "Cut the soap into 1 in (2.5 cm) thick slices.",
    "If the soap is too soft and starts to deform when you handle it, wait a few days.",
    "Once it feels more firm, you can try cutting it again.",
    "A special slicer made for soap making would be ideal, but you can also use any sharp, non-serrated knife.",
    "Skip this step if you poured the soap into individual soap molds.",
    "It\u2019s already the right size.",
    "Allow the bars to cure on a drying rack for 4 to 6 weeks.",
    "Spread the soap bars out on the rack while they dry so that they don\u2019t touch.",
    "If they touch, they won\u2019t cure evenly.",
    "About once per week, rotate the soap bars so that they cure evenly on each side.",
    "This may sound like a long time, but it's very important; although the soap is solid, the lye is still caustic and can burn your skin.",
    "Keep the soap in a warm, dry place throughout this period.",
    "This is key to helping the soap cure properly.",
    "The soap will be cured and useable within 4 weeks, but it will be harsh and drying.",
    "The longer you let it cure, however, the milder it will become."
