Choose a color as close to your paint color as possible. Apply the primer with a roller on long, wide surfaces, and with a brush for the areas that can't be covered with a roller. Allow the primer to dry according to manufacturer's instructions. Paint a second coat before painting cabinets if the first primer coat didn't fully cover the cabinet surfaces."
