  "text":" Choosing the Lobster Tails Check your supermarket for frozen lobster tails. The tails should be frozen, rather than re-frozen after sitting in the fresh fish section. Look for a use by date. Choose tails that have not yet expired. Check the label for added sodium triphosphate. This is often added to the lobster after it is caught, causing it to weigh more and cost more. Thawing the Tails Place 2 to 3 frozen lobster tails in the refrigerator overnight. Do not cook them while they are still frozen. Rinse the lobster tail in cold water. Place them on a cutting board. Cutting the Lobster Place some sharp kitchen shears at the top of the lobster shell. Cut down the length of the tail without cutting into the lobster meat. Slide a finger between the tail and the meat. This will dislodge the cartilage connecting the tail. Repeat on the other side of the cut. Some chefs prefer to leave the tail intact and cook lobster tail with the fan side down. If you prefer to do this, slice and remove the underside of the table. Then, use your fingers to loosen the tail from the fan for easy eating. Slice into the center of the lobster tail. However, only cut halfway through the width of the lobster meat. Piggyback the tail. You lift the tail through the slit in the shell and place it on top of the shell. The meat rests on the shell during baking. Seasoning the Lobster Place the 2 to 3 piggybacked tails side by side in a baking dish.  Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).  Pour 1 cup of water into the baking dish.  Combine 1 tbsp. (15ml) melted butter with 2 tbsp. (30ml) lemon juice, 1 tbsp. (1.9g) fresh minced parsley, a dash of salt and pepper. Pour the seasoning mix over the lobster tails.  Baking the Lobster Cover the dish with a layer of aluminum foil. Sealing off the top of the dish from the element will steam bake them, leaving more moisture in the flesh. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Baking time will depend upon the size (6 to 14 oz./170 to 369g) of the lobster tails. Remove the dish from the oven.  Sprinkle with more butter and parsley. Serve with lemon wedges.",
