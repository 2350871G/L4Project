Some models may vary, but in general, you can open a stapler by pulling it open or by pushing a back button. Load the stapler. Insert the recommended staples, placing the pointy legs first into the staple tray. To close top load staplers, push the top of the stapler down until it clicks into place.

This is the amount most manual desktop and electric staplers can bind, but heavy-duty staplers can handle up to 100 or more pieces. Be sure your papers are all facing the same way and are in the order you want to bind them in. Stapling Paper Put the upper left edge of the stack of paper in the stapler\u2019s mouth. The staple is going to come out of the stapler ejection gap (located at the very end of the stapler tray), so place the part you want to staple under it.

You can remove the staple if it is not in the location you wanted, if it is loose, or if it is bent. Pry open the staple legs, then pull the staple out, and try stapling it again. Unjam the stapler, if necessary. Staplers often jam if you try to staple too many papers or if a staple bends in an unexpected way. Open up the stapler, and use tweezers, pliers, or a similar tool to pull out any jammed staples. Unplug electronic staplers before fixing any jams. Using the Stapler for Tacking Open the stapler.
