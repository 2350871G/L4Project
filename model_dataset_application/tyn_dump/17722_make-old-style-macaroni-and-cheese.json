It will cook a little more in the oven, and if it's perfectly cooked when it goes in, it might come out too soft."

Turn the burner down a bit and let the roux bubble a few minutes (make sure the butter does not burn). Continue to stir to cook the flour a bit, but don't let it brown. Stir in the warm milk all at once, stirring vigorously with the whisk to smooth out any lumps. Whisk in the mustard and cayenne if you are using them and let the sauce bubble gently for about 2 minutes. This is just one of the many cheese sauces you can make.

The baked version is less creamy and has a crusty top. To butter the breadcrumbs, heat up some butter in a small skillet and stir in the crumbs or make them in the oven as described in How to Make Buttered Crumbs.
