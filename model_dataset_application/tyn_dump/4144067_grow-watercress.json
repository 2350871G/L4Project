Add a layer of landscaper\u2019s cloth at the bottom of the container to keep the potting mix from escaping when you water. Add pieces of broken pots or small pebbles to the bottom layer of the container to allow for good drainage. You can also use multiple small containers and place them in a larger drainage tray.
