Look for areas beneath trees so they\u2019re not exposed to direct sunlight, which can kill the delicate leaves of the bluebells.A small clearing in a wooded area is an ideal location to plant your bulbs.

Use a hose or bucket to fill the hole with water and let it sit overnight. The next day, refill the hole with water, then measure the water level with a ruler. Measure the water level every hour until the hole is empty. If the soil drains about 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6 cm) every hour, then it drains well.You can also look to see if water pools or collects in the area when it rains or if the ground sinks into a depression, which would indicate that the soil has poor drainage. Look for slightly elevated areas that allow water to runoff so your bulbs won\u2019t rot in standing water whenever it rains. If the soil in an area is damp, but the surrounding soil is dry, it\u2019s a sign of poor drainage.Tip: If your soil has poor drainage, try fixing it before you plant your English bluebell bulbs so they can thrive and aren\u2019t at risk of dry rotting whenever it rains."
