Tip: You can also fill in scratches with fine tip markers that match the color of the furniture's finish. Art supply stores carry a wide variety of colored markers. Compared to polishing furniture with a wood oil polish, wax polishes will leave more of a glowing sheen instead of a super glossy finish. If your wood furniture has already been polished with oil, then stick to using oil polishes instead of wax. Use wax only on furniture that already has a wax finish or is unfinished.
