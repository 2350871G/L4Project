  "text":" Making Seared Rump Steak Place both 8 oz (225 g) rump steaks in a shallow dish. Select a dish that is wide enough to easily accommodate the rump steaks. Arrange the steaks flat on the bottom of dish. The height of the dish just needs to be 2-3 inches taller than the rump steaks themselves. Mix the red wine, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic together. Measure out 3 fluid ounces (75 ml) of red wine and 3 fluid ounces (75 ml) of Worcestershire sauce. Combine both ingredients in a small bowl. Peel and crush 1 large clove of garlic.

Spoon the warm marinade sauce over each steak and serve them immediately. Refrigerate any leftovers in an air-tight container and consume them within 3 days. Making Oven-Baked Rump Steak Bring the large rump steak to room temperature. Take your steak out of the fridge and place it on the counter. Let the steak rest for about 1 hour until it reaches room temperature. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Let your oven fully preheat as you finish preparing the steaks. Add the oil to a medium-sized pan and heat it over high heat. Measure out about 1 teaspoon (4 ml) of groundnut or vegetable oil; it doesn\u2019t have to be exact. Add the oil to a large, heavy-based frying pan and place the pan on a burner. Turn the heat to high and let the oil heat up until it shimmers. You can use any cooking oil that is flavorless if you don\u2019t have vegetable or groundnut oil on hand. Pat the steak dry and season it with the sea salt. Use paper towels to soak up any moisture on the outside of your rump steak. Sprinkle both sides generously with the sea salt, adjusting the amount to your personal tastes as needed. Place the steak in the pan and cook the first side for 3 minutes. Carefully lower the rump steak into the hot oil in the pan. Be careful not to splash the hot oil. Sear the first side for 3 minutes. You don\u2019t need to stir or move the rump steak as it sears. Flip the steak with tongs and sear the other side for 3 minutes. Try not to splash the oil as you flip the steak over. You don\u2019t need to stir or move the rump steak as it sears for another 3 minutes. Transfer the steak to a roasting pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the steak from the heat.

Season both sides of each steak generously with salt and freshly ground pepper. Add the oil to a large saut\u00e9 pan and heat it up over medium-high heat. Measure out 1/8 cup (15 ml) of canola oil. Add it to the saut\u00e9 pan and place the pan on a burner. Turn the heat to medium-high and let the canola oil heat up until it shimmers. Dredge each steak in all-purpose flour. Add 1 cup (120 g) of flour to a deep bowl. Place the first steak in the flour, then flip it over. Pick it up and shake off the excessive flour. Place the steak on a clean plate.
