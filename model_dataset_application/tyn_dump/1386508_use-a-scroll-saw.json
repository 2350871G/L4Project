Add bridges within the pattern to create areas of positive and negative space. Positive space is where the wood is still intact and negative space is where the wood has been removed. The bridges are the positive spaces on the wood that connect the different parts. Stick to a simple design if you are just beginning to use a scroll saw. For example, practice making a leaf or a flower first, with only a few areas of negative space. There are many scroll saw patterns for beginners available online."

Apply a moderate amount of pressure to the midpoint of the blade with your finger. A blade that has been set to the correct tension will not move more than \u215b\" in (3 mm) in any direction. The right tension of the blade is about finding the balance between having the blade tight enough so that it doesn\u2019t cave and is accurate, but not so tight that it snaps. You can also check the tension of the blade by plucking it like a guitar string. A blade that has the right tension will make a sharp ping noise. Generally, the larger the blade the higher the tension it can withstand."

Make sure to also turn machine light on so that you can see what you\u2019re doing while you use the scroll saw. Some scroll saws don\u2019t come with a light source. If this is the case, get a bright lamp and position it so that you can see the saw and your work fully. You can also purchase specialty lights that can be mounted directly onto a scroll saw. If your machine has a dust blower, switch this on too. This will remove the dust from your work as you use the scroll saw so that you can see your design clearly."
