Mix up your favorite cake or cupcake recipe, then spoon the batter into 12 cups lined with paper and bake them according to the recipe. Remove the cupcakes and let them cool. If you're not familiar with making cupcakes, a simple vanilla cupcake is a great place to start. You can even make cupcakes from cake mix or buy pre-baked cupcakes from the bakery section if baking from scratch isn't your thing! Avoid cupcakes with fillings, as these may not be sturdy enough to stay intact through the dipping process. Tip: Try experimenting with different combinations of cupcake and gelatin flavors, like key lime or strawberry cupcakes with the lime gelatin in this recipe, or lemon cupcakes with a pineapple gelatin!"

Then, turn the mixer back on and continue beating the frosting until the tonic water is fully incorporated.

Since you're using lime gelatin, opt for 2-3 of green food coloring if you want it to be colorful. White icing glows the best. The darker you make the icing, the less it will glow. If you're using another flavor of gelatin, pick a color that matches! For example, you could use red food coloring for strawberry gelatin, or yellow if you're using lemon or pineapple."
