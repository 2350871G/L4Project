Lay your paper or other thin material you\u2019re cutting on top of that, place your die where you want it to make a cut on your paper, and top it with another thick layer of foam. Different machines can vary slightly. Follow the instructions on your particular machine for creating your die cut sandwich.

If there are places on your shape that did not fully cut and are still attached to your material, you\u2019ll need to move it back through the press."

The press will make a second cut on top of the first one, hopefully getting all the shape\u2019s edges to cleanly separate from the rest of the material. You can continue cranking the die cut back and forth through the machine. However, if it takes too many times to get your final cut, you may be using a material that\u2019s too thick for your machine."
