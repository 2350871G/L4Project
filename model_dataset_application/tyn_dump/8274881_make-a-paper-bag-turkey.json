Any additional materials will be up to you, depending on how elaborate you want the presentation of your finished turkey to be.

Shape the body of the turkey by hand until it\u2019s smooth and round. Be sure to work out any square edges of creases from the original bag.

Make one hand into a fist and stick it into each bag, molding the opening of the bag around your wrist. This will give the bag its recognizable drumstick shape. Remove your hand from the bag and fill the rounded end with newspaper. Twist the opening of each bag shut and secure it with a dab of glue.

Cut your sheet of typing paper in half lengthwise, then fold each piece in half, again lengthwise. Use your scissors to make a series of cuts in the open edge of the paper to create a neat fringe. Try to make your cuts about \u00bc inch apart. Your cuts only need to be about half the width of the paper."

That\u2019s it! The result is a quirky, lifelike baked bird that you might just mistake for the real thing. Attach the drumsticks to the tapered sides of the body where you folded down the edges of the big bag. This will give the turkey a more realistic look. The different parts of the turkey will have a little weight to them once they\u2019ve been filled. Use enough glue to make sure that everything holds."
