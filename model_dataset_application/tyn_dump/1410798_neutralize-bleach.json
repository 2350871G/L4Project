          "description":"There are several cost-effective choices for neutralizing chlorine bleach (commonly sold under the brand name Clorox), which is the kind used in washing and for decorating or changing the color of fabric products. It also contains sodium hydroxide (lye) to stabilize the hypochlorite. The lye is difficult to rinse out completely and will slowly destroy cotton. To fully neutralize the lingering effects of chlorine bleach the hypochlorite and the lye must be neutralized, too. If you\u2019re using bleach for decorative effects on cotton, denim, or other natural fabrics, you can try one of these options:\nBisulfite/metabisulfite is very inexpensive. It is sold under the brand name Anti-Chlor, and you only need to use a small amount to neutralize bleach. You can usually find bisulfite at dye suppliers or you can get Camden Tablets (which have the same ingredient) from a wine brewing supply company. Thiosulfate, which is called Bleach Stop, can typically be found at a local photography supply store, as it is commonly used in developing photographs. This is a more expensive option than bisulfite, and it\u2019s not as strong so you\u2019ll need to use more. Vitamin C/Ascorbic acid: Ascorbic acid neutralizes both the hypochlorite and the lye. You will find it in most food stores or pharmacies under its common name, vitamin C.  Yes,  get the cheapest vitamin C you can find and grind the tablets up into powder to dissolve in your rinse water. Hydrogen peroxide is the most easily obtainable of the neutralizers; you can find it at drugstores and grocery stores. This is an inexpensive choice, and it works well for people with asthma, who may be sensitive to the other compounds, which contain sulfur. Opt for the 3% solution."

Bleach Stop: 1 ounce by weight (30 grams) per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Vitamin C/Ascorbic acid: Crush up 4-6 tablets and add the powder to enough water to submerge the fabric.

This is an inexpensive neutralizer that you can find at your local grocery store.
