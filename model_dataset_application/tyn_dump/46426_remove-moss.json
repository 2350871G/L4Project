Pull the rake over the mossy area in different directions so you\u2019re more likely to rip it out of the ground. Continue raking the moss until you don\u2019t see anymore in your grass or soil.

Pour the granules of iron sulfate directly onto the mossy area so it has even coverage. Water the moss thoroughly so the iron sulfate can work into the moss and kill it faster. Wait 2\u20133 hours before you try raking the moss out of the ground. If the moss doesn\u2019t come up after 2\u20133 hours, try again the next day. You can also treat your entire lawn by pouring the granules in a garden spreader and walking it through your lawn.Warning: Keep children and pets out of the treated area for 2\u20133 hours since it can be toxic if ingested in large doses."

Place the aerator in 1 corner of your lawn and walk it in a straight line. Work back and forth across your entire lawn with the aerator so you can have healthy soil. Buy or rent an aerator from your local garden or lawn care store. Aerating lawns will not kill moss on its own. Compacted soil can trap moisture above ground and cause moss to form in your lawn."

    "You can scrub your roof with a cleaning brush after you rinse off the solution to help remove more moss.Variation: If you want to remove moss without chemicals, you can combine 1 \u20442\u20133 \u20442 cups (350\u2013830 ml) of white vinegar and 2 gallons (7.6 L) of warm water for your cleaning solution.",
    "Install strips of zinc or copper along the roof ride to kill moss in the future.",
    "Zinc and copper are toxic to moss, so rainwater that runs over the metal will prevent any spores from growing on your roof.",
    "Cut the metal into strips that are 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) wide and about 2\u20133 feet (61\u201391 cm) long using a metal cutting blade on a saw.",
    "Place the strips right underneath the ridge on the peak of your roof and secure them with roofing nails every 6 inches (15 cm).",
    "You can buy sheet metal from hardware stores.",
    "Ask the employees to cut the strips to size for you if you don\u2019t have any tools at home.",
    "You may also tuck the strip underneath the first row of shingles so only 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) extend out if you don\u2019t want large pieces of exposed metal.",
    "If you need to put in new roofing material, look for shingles that have copper particles built into them since they can prevent moss growth.",
    "Prune overhanging tree limbs to prevent moss from forming again.",
    "Moss grows the best in shady areas from tree branches and limbs.",
    "Look at your roof at different times throughout the day to see when it gets shade and what branches are causing it.",
    "For small limbs, use a tree saw to cut the branches as close to the base as possible so they don\u2019t grow back as easily.",
    "If you have large, heavy limbs, contact a professional service to remove them for you.",
    "Don\u2019t attempt to remove large branches on your own since they could damage your roof or cause serious injury when they fall."
