It is important to let the top 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of soil dry out before watering. To check, stick a finger into the soil up to your knuckle. If the soil is dry to this point, then it is time to water."

Fertilizing too frequently can cause the plant to grow quite vigorously, so if you find that it's getting too large, cut back on fertilizer. Most bougainvillea gardeners go with a 1:1:1 or a 2:1:2 fertilizer for regular fertilizing, not the high-phosphate fertilizer used at planting. Organic or slow-release fertilizers work best. Be sure to fertilize at least once a year, at the beginning of spring, to help the season's growth get underway."

After the bougainvillea has finished blooming for the season, cut it back by a few inches. This will promote healthy growth in the spring. Wear gloves when pruning bougainvillea.
