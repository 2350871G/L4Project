Flux is an oily or watery substance, depending on the type, that cleans metal surfaces so they bind better. For stainless steel, an acid flux removes oxides from the steel surface and helps the metals stick together. Use a strong, acid-based flux. Wet a brush with the flux and apply it to the stainless steel. Look for a flux that is specifically designed for stainless steel use. This is usually printed on the product label. Use gloves and eye protection when handling acids. Other rosin-based fluxes are not effective for soldering stainless steel. Use a stronger, acid-based flux. If you\u2019re soldering 2 pieces of stainless steel, wipe them both with the flux. If you\u2019re soldering stainless steel to another metal, only wipe the steel."
