Position the magnifying glass at the edge of a sturdy table with the handle hanging off the table\u2019s edge. Place a handsaw at the point where the handle meets the glass and apply pressure as you move the saw back and forth over the handle to remove it. Alternatively, you can use an old camera lens instead of a magnifying glass. You will not need to remove a handle if you use a camera lens. Use a lens that you will not be using on a camera anymore, as you may damage it if you attempt to remove it from your movie projector later. Wear protective goggles and gloves when using your handsaw. Children should ask for help from an adult for this part of the project."

Setting up Your Device Cut some sturdy foam board into 2 6.5 in \u00d7 4 in (17 cm \u00d7 10 cm) pieces. Purchase some thick foam board from a craft store.

Apply more glue to both sides of where the 2 boards meet to help your stand stay secure. Place 2 strips of double-sided tape onto a side of the standing part of your foam.

You need to have your device screen at its brightest possible setting because the lens of your projector will cause the image to darken a bit when it shines through. Playing a Movie Set your device up to play through a Bluetooth speaker. Purchase or borrow a small Bluetooth speaker so that the sound of your movie isn't muffled.

Stick your device onto the tape of your foam stand. Place the stand with the device attached into the box at the back end away from the lens. Leave the lid of your shoebox off the box until after you start the movie. Position the shoebox so the lens is facing a white, blank wall. You will need a blank wall to play your movie, and it should be painted white or another very light color. Remove any wall decorations that would be in the way of the image when you start the movie.
