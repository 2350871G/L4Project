Check the screen and clean it of lint every time before you place a load inside. Grab the handle of the screen and pull it out until it is fully extended. In most models, you will be able to remove it entirely for cleaning. Only apply gentle pressure when pulling out the screen. You should meet with little to no resistance. If you bend the screen too much, it may not fit back properly into the lint trap area."

Keep going until you can see through the screen without any blockages. Toss the gathered lint in the trash. Instead of your hand, rubbing a cleaning brush across the surface of the screen will gather the lint just as well. However, just make sure to discard the lint pulled from the screen, as it could present a fire hazard. Placing a vacuum brush attachment against the screen is another way to remove the lint.

Kathryn Kellogg\t\t\tAuthor, 101 Ways to Go Zero Waste\t\t\t\tConsider composting your lint if you wear clothing made of natural fibers. If you're drying natural fibers like wool, cotton, hemp, bamboo, viscose, or tensile, your dryer lint will be compostable, because it's cellulose-based. However, if your clothes are made of polyester or acrylic, your dryer lint will be plastic, so it's not compostable."
