Choose the exact same color; this could be good where you want it stand out against a plain top. Choose a rainbow of colors. Choose different patterns, or even sizes of buttons. Whatever buttons you choose, ensure that they are in excellent condition and will be able to withstand being turned into an often-worn item of jewelry.
