          "description":"Turn on your vacuum cleaner and push it back and forth across the top surface of your rug to suck up loose dust and debris. Work in long, parallel strokes so that you clean the entire rug. Try to vacuum your rug at least once per week. Depending on the rug\u2019s thickness, you may need to adjust the knob on the vacuum that controls its suction power. Vacuuming a shag rug is a great way to get dust and dirt out of its long fibers. However, turn off the vacuum\u2019s beater bar so you don\u2019t inadvertently tear fibers off of the rug. If your vacuum doesn\u2019t have a turn-off for the beater bar, try borrowing a different vacuum from a friend. When you\u2019re vacuuming an Oriental rug or a home-made or hand-knotted rug, set a sheet of nylon screening over the rug for protection. Weigh the edges of the nylon down with 3\u20134 books. Sprinkle baking soda onto your rug and let it sit on your rug before vacuuming every 3 months. This will help deodorize your rug."

Once the top of the rug is dirt-free, flip it over and lay the rug flat on the ground. Use the same technique to vacuum dirt and grime off of the bottom of the rug. Flip the rug back right-side up once you\u2019ve vacuumed the underside."

Hold on to one of the short edges of the rug, and vigorously shake it. This will dislodge any pieces of dirt, food, etc., that are stuck deep in the rug fiber. Also try beating the rug with a broom handle while you\u2019re holding it in the air. If you see puffs of dust coming from the rug, keep beating it. However, if you\u2019re cleaning an old or expensive area rug, don\u2019t beat it with a broom handle. In fact, depending on the rug\u2019s condition, it might be best not to shake it outside."

If you\u2019ve vacuumed and shaken out your rug and there\u2019s still fur in it, brush the rug with a stiff-bristle brush. Brush hairy spots on the rug with short, repetitive strokes to tease out the animal hair. You can purchase a brush with stiff plastic bristles at a hardware store. Don\u2019t use a brush with metal bristles, as these will tear up the rug."
