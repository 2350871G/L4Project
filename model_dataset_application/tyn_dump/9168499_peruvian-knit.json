The most notable difference is how you hold your right hand needle. You will need to hold the needle like a pencil so that the pointed end of the needle is resting between your index finger and middle finger and your thumb is keeping the other end of the needle in place. The point of the needle should extend about one inch (2.5 cm) beyond the tip of your index and middle finger. Your grip on the needle should be firm, but comfortable. Again, it should feel similar to holding a pencil."

Grip the needle with your hand so that your knuckles are on the top side of your stitches. Your hand should be positioned a couple of inches (5 cm) from the tip of the needle. Make sure that your hand is positioned so that there are a few stitches exposed near the end of the needle. This will ensure that you can easily access them with the other needle. Keep in mind that you will need to reposition this hand regularly to expose new stitches."
