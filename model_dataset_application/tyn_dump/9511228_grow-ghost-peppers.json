          "description":"If you're planting pepper plants in the ground, pick an area that is free of any muddy areas or pools of water. On the other hand, the soil should not be completely dry, either. If your soil does not drain well, the easiest option is to grow your ghost peppers in planters filled with potting soil. To test how well your soil drains:\nTake a coffee can and remove its top and bottom. Dig a hole 4 inches (10 cm) deep into your soil. Set the coffee can in the hole. Fill in any extra space around it with soil. Pour water into the can until it fills up. Wait an hour, then come back and measure how far down the water has dropped in the can, using a ruler. If 2 inches (5.1 cm) or more of water has drained out within the hour, then your soil drains well."

You can use either a digital probe or paper strips. Just follow the instructions included with your kit for proper use. You can add pulverized limestone to your soil if it is too acidic. Usually, you can apply 5 pounds (2.3 kg) per 100 feet (30 m) square. If you're working with a small area, just lightly sprinkle a bit on  your soil. If your soil is too alkaline (with a pH above 7.0), then you can add soil sulfur by lightly sprinkling some where you want to grow your peppers. Some gardeners will place 2-3 unlit matches in the soil per plant instead (match heads contain sulfur). Pulverized limestone and soil sulfur can be found at garden stores.
