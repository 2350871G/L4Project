          "description":"More mature blossoms are more likely to lose petals through air drying, so it's best to choose flowers that have just bloomed and haven't fully opened yet. If you are picking flowers from your own garden, go out in the morning after the dew has evaporated. Flowers that air-dry well include marigolds, lavender, roses, cornflowers, and hydrangeas."

          "description":"The more leaves you keep on the stems, the longer your flowers will take to dry and the more likely your flowers are to attract mold. Cut the stems no shorter than 6 inches (15 cm). Longer stems are easier to bind. You can always cut the stems after the flowers are dry."

          "description":"If you use twine to tie a bouquet of flowers together, you can tighten it as the flowers dry out. However, rubber bands can work just as well. Make sure the flowers are tied tightly enough so that they don't slip out, but not so tightly that you're crushing the stems. Crushed stems can stay damp and get moldy."

Keeping the flowers out of direct sunlight will help them retain a little bit more color. The flowers should be dry in around 2-4 weeks. The flowers will change color as they dry and become less vibrant."

You can also gently spritz the dried flowers with hair spray to make them last even longer and keep from crumbling. Use florist's foam to keep your flowers even more securely in place."

    "Use a single color of flower for a monochromatic look.",
    "To get a color-coordinated display, try drying a bouquet of one type of flower, such as white daisies or red roses.",
    "You can also dry different kinds of flowers in the same color for variation in texture.",
    "Trim the stems off of the flowers to keep a monochromatic color scheme.",
    "Alternatively, create layered or ombre look.",
    "Start by filling the jar 1/4 full of flowers in one color, then fill another 1/4 of the jar with another color, and so on until the jar is full.",
    "Place a single flower in a small jar for a minimalist look.",
    "Trim the stem off of a flower and place the dried bloom in a small jar or bottle.",
    "You can also try adding other natural decoration, such as pretty stones or shells, to add to your display.",
    "Try an apothecary jar for a romantic effect.",
    "Pull the petals off of the flower to create a confetti display.",
    "Fill your jar with dried petals, rather than whole flowers, for a pretty keepsake.",
    "Dried rose petals are a good choice for a fragrant and pretty display.",
    "You can also add in dried lavender, cinnamon sticks, and whole cloves to make a delicious-smelling potpourri.",
    "Go for a single color of flower petals to create a more understated look.",
    "Avoid over-filling the jar.",
    "To keep the flowers or petals intact, fill the jar loosely.",
    "When you notice that you have to press down on the buds to make them fit, the jar is too full.",
    "If your display looks a little sparse, fill it in with smaller flowers like baby's breath.",
    "Finish your display off with a bow made of twine.",
    "Tie a bit of twine or ribbon around the mouth of the jar for a bit of extra decoration.",
    "Twine will make your jar look more rustic, while choosing a coordinating color of ribbon can make your display more vintage chic.",
    "You can also add a pretty label or decorative stickers to the jar."
