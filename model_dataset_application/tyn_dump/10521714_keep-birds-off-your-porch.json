Poke a hole in your foil or disposable pie plates and feed a string through it to make a loop. Hang the reflectors on your porch around posts or nails so birds avoid flying or roosting in the area. Attach shiny pinwheels to any posts around your porch to make a reflective deterrent that moves in the wind. When the blades spin, the light will reflect in different areas. You can also use small mirrors or old CDs to reflect light."

Look for a fake owl with a bobbling head so it looks like it's moving in the wind. Once every few days, move the fake owl to a different place to make it seem like it's flown to a new spot.

Loop a string or fishing line through the hole and glue it in place. 3. Drill 4-5 holes along the top of the can. 4. Tie old silverware to the ends of strings. 5. Feed the strings through the holes around the can so the silverware hangs down. Make sure there's 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of string between the can and the silverware. 6.
