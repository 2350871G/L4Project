Clean the hoses, connectors, and valves with a sponge to remove dirt from them clean and rinse them off with water. Dry off all of the parts after you clean them. All of the components need to be sanitized to keep out dust, dirt, bacteria, and other contaminants. Insert a large funnel into a length of 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter tubing. Use a length of plastic tubing that\u2019s at least 3 feet (0.91 m) long so you can fit an entire can of beer into the beer bong. Slide the narrow end of the funnel into the opening of the tube. Push it as far into the tube as you can.

Try using a length of 9 feet (2.7 m) to fit up to 3 beers! But if you do opt for a larger beer bong, drink responsibly. Consuming too much alcohol too quickly can cause serious medical problems. Slide a hose clamp onto the tubing over the funnel. A hose clamp looks like a thin metal ring with a screw on the side of it and is used to secure hoses and tubes so they\u2019re airtight.

Using the Beer Bong Wipe off the mouthpiece and make sure the ball valve is shut off. Check the switch on the ball valve and look for the \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d labels.
