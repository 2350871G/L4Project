Lay the halves flat and cut them into quarters or chunks that are around 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size. You can use Russet potatoes, which become light brown on the outside and fluffy on the inside, yellow potatoes, which brown more and are more flavorful, or a combination of them. If you'd like larger potatoes, add a few minutes to the cooking time. To cut the potatoes smaller, decrease the cooking time by a few minutes."
