Do not try to force the doors open yourself. If the lift starts working again when you are partway out, you could be in for a nasty surprise. If you can't see light between the doors, the lift has stopped between floors, and no one will be able to let you out if you scream for help. Look for an emergency telephone. If there is no telephone, there should be an alarm button. Press this repeatedly. Eventually, someone should hear you and get help. If it seems like no one can hear you, don't give up hope! Keep pressing the button, and know that you will be rescued."

If there are still people in the building, you must get their help before they leave for the night. If everyone has left the building, and no one is responding to you, then you'll have to accept that you will be in the lift overnight. If this happens, stop shouting and banging - you don't want to develop sleep deprivation. You are probably tired by now. Make yourself as comfortable as possible, and get some sleep to save your energy. By morning, the building should be full again, and you can try to get some help then."
