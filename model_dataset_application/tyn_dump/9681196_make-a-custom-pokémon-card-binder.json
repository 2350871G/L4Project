Once you do that, open your Pok\u00e9mon binder. Once your binder is opened, you will need to open rings in order to put your Pok\u00e9mon card sheets in. To do this, pull the tabs on both sides of the inside of your binder. Once your rings are open, put your sheets filled with Pok\u00e9mon cards inside the binder. Make sure you put the holes on your sheets in the rings. Then, close your rings by pushing the tabs inward. If done correctly, your sheets should stay in securely, and you are able to see all of your Pok\u00e9mon. If you have more than one of the same Pok\u00e9mon (which includes the name, HP, and attacks), then both them in the sheets pocket.
