Instead of using grommets and curtain clips, you could instead use cafe clips which directly attach to the fabric. Thread these over the wire rope and attach them to the fabric at regular intervals to hang your curtains. Thicker materials such as canvas will be heavier but may do more to block out light and sound, whereas lighter materials can give an airier feel to the room. Keep this in mind when choosing your fabric. If you have small children or pets, it might be easier to leave the curtains a foot or so off the ground.
