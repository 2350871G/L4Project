If you\u2019re having trouble breaking up a dry stain, use a putty knife and a citrus cleaner such as Goo Gone. Spray a lubricant like WD-40 on dried paint and let it sit for 20-25 minutes. This helps soften the paint so you can remove it easier."

Starting at the outside edges of the stain will help you to contain the spill. Make sure you are blotting and not rubbing in the paint.
