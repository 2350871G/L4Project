Hold the bin inside a trash bag before opening it. Prepare for a bunch of debris to spill out as soon as you press the button. If you haven\u2019t positioned the bin over a bag, you may end up with a mess in your home to vacuum up again! Shake the vacuum around to knock loose as much dust as you can.

Then, wipe up the debris and sweep the excess out into the trash. Dishwashers are too hot and rough for the bin, so don\u2019t put it in there. Always clean it out by hand.

If the combination brush isn\u2019t available, try using another brush. Choose something soft to avoid scratching the plastic.
