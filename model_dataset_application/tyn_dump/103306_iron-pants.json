Adjust the ironing board to a comfortable height, and make sure the legs are locked before you start ironing.

To create this or follow your existing fold, lay 1 pant leg on the ironing board so that the inseams are directly over each other. Press the iron down at the top and bottom of the leg, and then fill in space by pressing the rest of the crease between the 2 iron points. Ensure the inseams are lined up as you do this to create a smooth, straight crease. Your crease should stop approximately at the bottom of the pockets on the front of the leg."
