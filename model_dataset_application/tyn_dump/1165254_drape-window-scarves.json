You can pin the window scarf together on the parts in the middle where it overlaps to keep the shape you created in place. Hanging Window Scarves with Hooks Install scarf hooks at both corners of the top of the window. Measure 3 in (7.6 cm) past the corners of the window frame and make a mark with a pencil. Hold the hooks in place over your mark and mark where the holes will go, then place a screw in 1 hole and screw it in with a drill.

Stretch a scarf straight across the top of the window from hook to hook or along a curtain rod. Drape another scarf as you normally would from hook to hook, or wrapped around a curtain rod in front of the shorter scarf, to create a layered look. Play with different fabrics to get the look you want. Try a delicate fabric of a lighter color in the back, and a heavier, darker fabric for the front scarf. Fold and tie your scarf to add details. Lay your window scarf out flat with the front side facing down. Fold the fabric lengthwise in 6 in (15 cm) - 8 in (20 cm) folds toward you. Tie the folds loosely into place at regular intervals with contrasting ribbons or ropes. Drape the window scarf with the tied parts hanging down so they stand out. Play with patterns and colors that provide contrast between fabrics. Mix patterned scarves with solid-colored scarves when you layer them. Add patterned or brightly-colored ribbons or ropes that stand out from the window scarf. For example, you could use gold ropes to tie a dark blue or purple window scarf, or layer a floral-patterned scarf behind a solid white scarf.",
