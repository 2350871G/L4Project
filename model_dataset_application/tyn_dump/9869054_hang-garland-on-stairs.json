Since you\u2019ll either be draping or wrapping the garland, add about 1 foot (0.30 m) to your measurements for every 3 feet (0.91 m) of banister. For example, if you have a banister that is 15 feet (4.6 m) long, you would purchase 20 feet (6.1 m) of garland."

Secure the garland at every third or fourth spindle and let it sag between those points. The dips in the garland are called swag! The amount of swag in between each point depends on your preference. You can make the drops as large and dramatic or as small and quaint as you\u2019d like! Larger drops between the points will use more garland, so make sure you have enough on hand if you\u2019re planning on going for a dramatic look."

Lowering the garland allows for more use of the hand rail, but still makes your stairs look festive! For a fuller look, weave two strands of garland in opposite directions to completely cover the bottom of the spindles. Be careful when walking on the stairs, especially if you have children.
