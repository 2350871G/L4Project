You can sow the seeds outside in a bed placing them about 18\u201324 inches (46\u201361 cm) apart. However, growing sage from seed can be challenging and it can take up to two years for the plant to reach maturity. Many gardeners choose to start plants from cuttings because of this. Start with cuttings. If you tried starting fro seeds, and the plants didn't germinate properly, then try to start a plant with sage cuttings. Cut a stem off a healthy mature sage plant at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Remove the leaves at the bottom, but make sure to keep at least a couple pairs of leaves at the top. Place your sage cutting into soil and water it. Be careful not to give it too much or too little water."

Once it's ready, take the trimmers and cut the stems of the desired leaves at the base of the plant. Be sure not to harvest more than half the plant so it will continue to grow for future harvests. If you are not confident enough to grow your own sage, or if it is too late in the season to start a new plant, you can purchase a sage plant."
