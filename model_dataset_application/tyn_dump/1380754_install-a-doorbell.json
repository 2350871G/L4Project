Visitors should be able to spot it easily when they are standing in front of your door. Placing the doorbell switch around eye-level on either side of your door frame is a good bet. It is best to opt for a weatherproof model of doorbell that will not be damaged by rain or snow."

Measure the switch and holes and use an electric drill to mount the switch on your door or wall.

Pick a room that is relatively equal in distance from all the other rooms in your home. Choose a room that you do not usually close the doors to make sure that the sound will carry. For instance, you might install the chime box in your living room or dining room."

Many models of chimes will include small wiring diagrams printed inside to help with installation. The cover should pull off the chimes easily without the use of tools.
