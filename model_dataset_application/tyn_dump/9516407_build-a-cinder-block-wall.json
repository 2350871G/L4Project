Start by measuring the width of your future wall, then calculate the footing area. Use a tape measure to find the dimensions of the footing area on the ground. For example, if your wall will be 3 feet (0.91 m) wide, your footing area should be between 6 feet (1.8 m) and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. Footing helps to spread the weight of a load-bearing wall across an area of soil. The taller and heavier your wall is, the wider the footing should be. Your footers should be free any potential water seeping or pooling. Make sure that your planned footing areas are all set up to drain water away from the footing. Remember to check with local building codes to make sure you are in compliance, as well."

    "Strike the joints with a rubber mallet or sledgehammer.",
    "This will help to solidify the bricks in place.",
    "Do this shortly after checking the mortar to make sure it has hardened somewhat, but not completely.",
    "If you choose to use a sledgehammer, be sure to use one that is 2 pounds (0.91 kg) or less.",
    "Rubber mallets tend to produce more consistent results with less chance of causing damage.",
    "Strike the horizontal joints first using gentle pressure.",
    "Then strike the vertical joints gently.",
    "Scrape off the excess mortar and strike both joints once more.",
    "Build up the corner with cinder blocks.",
    "Once your wall is 3-4 blocks high, you're ready to turn the corner of your wall.",
    "Do the same things listed above, but remember to use alternating half blocks in either direction to make sure your wall remains sturdy.",
    "Use a large level often to make sure the corners are plumb and square.",
    "Be sure that the joint line is staggered from block to block."
