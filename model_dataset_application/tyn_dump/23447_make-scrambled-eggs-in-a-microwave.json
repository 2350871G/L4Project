You can use your favorite cheese or try cheddar, parmesan, feta, or goat cheese. If you forget to add cheese to the eggs, you can always scatter shredded cheese over the cooked eggs before you eat them. To melt the cheese, microwave the eggs for an extra 5 to 10 seconds. For an extra-creamy texture, stir a few spoonfuls of cream cheese or cottage cheese into the eggs before you microwave them."

For example, stir a small handful of chopped bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo into the eggs about 30 seconds before they're finished microwaving.Tip: You can buy precooked bacon or cook it in the microwave before you make the scrambled eggs. To add a slightly smoky flavor, mix in flaked smoked salmon or trout."

Then, crack in 2 eggs and beat them with a fork before you microwave the hash. Heat the mixture for 1 1/2 to 2 more minutes or until the eggs are cooked.

Try using minced dill, basil, parsley, or chives to give the eggs a bold flavor. If you don't have access to fresh herbs, sprinkle dried herbs into the eggs before you microwave them. You could also stir a little pesto into the cooked eggs but it can turn them slightly green."

For a quick seasoning, sprinkle a little spice blend, such as za'atar or garam masala, over the eggs."
