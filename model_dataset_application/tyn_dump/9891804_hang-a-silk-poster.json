Then, purchase a poster hanger that is the same size or 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) longer than your silk poster. Poster hangers are designed to be slightly longer than the size of your poster. You can purchase a poster hanger with either a string to hang from the wall or a clip to slide into the back of your top hanger.

To insert your poster, simply hold the corners of the fabric in your hands, and push it into the slit. Once inside, slide your poster into place by its sides. If you have a hanger with a clip, find the slot on the back of the hanger and slide the clip into the center. Stop sliding your poster when you reach the edge of the top hanger."

Your hangers will either come with an attached string, or you can hang the poster by the clip on the top hanger. If your silk poster is very long, hammer your nail towards the top of your wall.

After you have secured your corners, rip additional pieces of tape \u20442\u20132 in (1.3\u20135.1 cm) long, and stick them to the edges of your silk poster. As you secure 1 side of the silk, keep the other side taught so it stretches flat across the cardboard. Reassemble your frame when your silk is secure. Once your silk poster is attached to your cardboard backing, place it back inside the frame so the poster side faces the glass. Then, re-hinge the frame using your hands or a screwdriver. Hang your frame from a nail to hang your poster permanently. Position your nails on your wall about \u2154 of the way towards your ceiling.
