Resize the pattern to the cube size you want. Bear in mind that you may need to adjust quantities of fabric, stuffing and foam for larger cubes. The quantities given in this article are enough to create an 8 inch (20cm) plush cube. Print off at least six copies of the pattern. Add a half an inch (1 cm) wide perimeter to your square for a seam allowance.  Cut six squares (include the seam allowance) each of your batting, the light grey fleece and the dark grey fleece.  Use the pattern to cut six hearts from the pink fleece.  Cut twelve half inch (1 cm) wide strips of pink fleece that are the length of a side of the cube. These will be the first things sewn. Fold each grey square in half to find the horizontal and vertical center lines.  Sew a half inch (1 cm) pink strip to each of the center lines to form a cross in the exact center of the square. Make two parallel lines of stitching approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) from each other on each pink strip. Trim the excess fabric away to leave only the narrow pink lines. Layer the batting and light grey fleece squares over the dark grey squares and their pink lines.  Lay one of the paper patterns over your fabric and batting sandwich. Take care to line up the pink lines from the pattern with the underlying pink lines you sewed onto the bottom, dark grey, layer. Pin carefully. Take care to line up the sewn pink lines with the pattern. Using a fairly short stitch, sew along the pattern lines on the paper. Back stitch each section as you sew it, to prevent the seam unraveling. Lift the needle and pressure foot between each section. (Don't stitch any extra or connecting lines between sections.) Remove the fabric and paper sandwich from the machine. The paper should tear away from the fabric along the seam lines fairly easily, since the needle holes create a perforated line as you sew. Remove all the pattern paper. Orient and center a pink heart in the center circle. Pin it in place and top stitch it carefully to the center. Place the tip of a sharp pair of scissors between the bottom, dark grey, layer and the batting layer.  Cut away the light grey layer and the batting layer from only the areas which should be dark grey. (Center \"O\" and the lines going out from it to the edge.) Trim away the edges neatly, taking care not to nick the seam or bottom, dark grey, layer.  Repeat the process 5 more times.  Carefully center each of your assembled cube sides and mark the side seam lines with washable pen or tailors chalk on the back side.
