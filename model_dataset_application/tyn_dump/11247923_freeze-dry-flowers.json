To get your flowers to open up more, try recutting their stems and letting them drink warm water. Use a deep vase so that flowers have a lot of water to help them open.

Place the flowers in a vase or container with room-temperature water and let them absorb the water for 12 hours. Even though you will eventually be drying the flowers, you want them to absorb a lot of water right now so that dry in a full shape."

To decide how much stem to remove, think about how you plan to arrange your flowers when you are done."

It\u2019s okay if the flowers touch each other, but it\u2019s best to have them spaced out on the trays. Most freeze dryer machines can freeze about three trays at once, so there\u2019s no need to crowd all your flowers onto one tray.

The blackout cover comes with the machine and slides right over the door to provide extra insulation. Close the door tightly. The door to the chamber has to be completely sealed for the freeze drying to work. Some machines have locks or handles you have to turn to ensure that the door is fully closed.
