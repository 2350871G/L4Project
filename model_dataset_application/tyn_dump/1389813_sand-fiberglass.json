Use a heat gun on a low setting and peel any stickers off. If you don't have a heat gun, try heating the stickers with a blow dryer instead. Don't use a knife or scraper to remove the stickers because you could scratch the fiberglass."

          "description":"If your fiberglass piece ever had decals or stickers on it, there is probably adhesive residue left over on the surface. This prevents you from sanding properly in these areas. Pour some acetone onto a rag and scrub areas where stickers were attached to remove the residue. Acetone is available at hardware stores. Use safety precautions when using acetone. Keep any flames away from it because it\u2019s flammable. Wear gloves to prevent acetone from getting on your skin and do not put your face near it. If any acetone gets on your skin, flush the area with running water for 5 minutes. If you ingest it or get any in your eyes, contact poison control immediately."

Then dip a sponge or rag in and scrub the fiberglass surface. If you use a sponge, don\u2019t use the rough side. This could scratch the fiberglass. If you\u2019re working with a small enough object, wash it in your sink or bathtub. If the object is larger than this, such as a tub or boat, wash it outside with a hose."

Use 120- to 180-grit sandpaper or a sanding block and move it back and forth over the surface. Only sand until the glossy finish starts coming off and the surface is no longer shiny. Sand the whole surface of the fiberglass. If you miss any spots, your paint will look uneven."

Keep the sander moving constantly to prevent friction from building up in one spot. Stop sanding when the glossy layer comes off and the finish is no longer shiny.

Stop sanding in that spot immediately. Use a lighter touch in other spots to prevent similar ruptures. Don\u2019t worry if you exposed the fiberglass by sanding too hard.

Get fiberglass resin, hardener, and cloth matting from a hardware or auto repair store. Cut a piece of matting the size of the area you have to repair and put it over the damaged area. Then mix the resin and hardener together and brush it onto the matting. Sand this area again after the resin dries. Make sure you don\u2019t break through the surface layer this time."

You don\u2019t have to scrub or wipe hard. The wet rag should pick up any reside easily. Mineral spirits are less abrasive than many solvents, but can still cause irritation. Avoid inhaling or splashing it into your eyes, and work in a well-ventilated area. If you get any on your hands, run them under a faucet for 5 minutes. After the fiberglass is completely cleaned off, you can proceed with painting it if that's your goal."
