Gently insert a screwdriver, crowbar, or similar tool between each vine and the surface it is clinging to. Slowly pull the vine up and away. If you are removing vines from a tree, pull them off slowly to avoid damaging the tree's bark."

Remove the underground roots, bulbs, and tubers completely to effectively kill the vines. For best results, do this when the soil is moist and soft in the spring. You will be able to move more of the dirt around this way, giving you better access to the root system.

Use a gas-powered machine that will be powerful enough to cut through tough vines instead of just rolling over them. Doing this at least 3-4 times a year will slowly kill the spreading vine. Electric or rotary mowers are more likely to run over vines than to cut them. If you want to reduce the hard labor of killing vines, this is the best option to try, though it will take regular, repeat mowing for it to be effective."

Applying a Systemic Herbicide Buy a triclopyr herbicide to kill thick, woody vines. Systemic herbicides enter the vines' circulatory system through their leaves, then kill off their roots.
