Don't set it and forget it, though; if it gets too dry, it will be difficult to remove. Strippers come as liquids, or in thicker formulations referred to as gels, semi-pastes or pastes. Liquid strippers are only good for horizontal surfaces. For vertical surfaces, the thicker strippers are able to hang on better. As useful as they are, chemical strippers can be bad news if used improperly. Treat them with care -- use adequate ventilation, rubber gloves, and eye protection when using these substances. After all, they are designed to soften, peel and blister paint and varnish -- you do not want them to do the same to your skin, lungs or eyes. Always follow the safety recommendations on the container. If your interest is in restoring antique or valuable old furniture, look first at products designed to clean and restore antique furniture without refinishing, and always test such products in an inconspicuous area before use. It may be that the old finish itself contributes to the value of the furniture."

Repeat the process multiple times if need be. Remove as much paint or varnish as you can with a scraper or putty knife. Round the edges of your scraping tool to prevent it from gouging the wood. Follow-up with medium grade steel wool. Soaking the steel wool in the stripper may help remove stubborn spots. Some finishes, particularly enamels, will require multiple applications of stripper to get the job done. Despite what you may read on the back of a can, if you want to do a really good job, some sanding will still be required after the old finish is removed by the stripper."

But if your wood has a tight grain, you can skip this part. You can buy grain filler in a whole bunch of different colors. If you'd like the grain to stand out, purchase a color that will contrast with the final color of your table (post-staining). If grain isn't your thing, fill it with a color that will match the finished color of your piece. To apply the paste, use a rag or stiff paintbrush. For this step, it's best to follow the directions on the packaging. Work it into the grain well and let it dry. If there's excess in certain places, remove it with your scraper or putty knife.

Then, with a clean rag, wipe off the excess. Make sure it's completely dry before you go over it lightly with sandpaper. 220 grit is good here. Take the stain off your table. If the finish is a stain, you will want to use sandpaper and sand with the grain of the wood until all the stain is gone. Use a hand power sander if you want to, but be careful not to gouge the wood.

Since you've put in the dirty work of stripping and sanding, it'll be thirsty for the stain, so time is of the essence. Once you have your stain on, grab a piece of cheesecloth to remove the excess. If it's still too light, just repeat the process once more, still maintaining an eye for evenness. Apply at least 2 coats of stain, using a light grade sandpaper in between coats to smooth the surface of any fibers sticking up. If you're looking to go green, liquid water-based stains should be your pick; they're better for the environment. They work much the same as oil-based stains, as more applications equals a deeper color. They're also very convenient in that they clean up well with only soap and water. The only downside is that they can raise the grain of the wood. To minimize this effect, dampen the wood with a moist, clean rag."
