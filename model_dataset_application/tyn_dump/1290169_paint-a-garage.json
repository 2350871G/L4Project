Exterior Garage Power wash the siding first. Pay special attention to areas that have mildew or are badly stained. Decide on your color and purchase a paint that is compatible with the type of siding you have on your garage, whether it is aluminum, vinyl, cedar plank or some other substance.  Paint from the top down, preferably using a power paint sprayer, which is more efficient than a brush or a roller for this application.  Interior Garage Prepare the interior walls and ceiling as you would inside your home. Patch holes, scrapes and tears with Spackle or joint compound. Sand it smooth and put a stain blocking primer undercoat on it. Let the primer dry and then apply exterior paint. Do not use interior paint. Even though the inside of your garage is not exposed to the elements, it is neither protected as the inside of your home.
