          "description":"MDF is a dense type of material made with compressed wood fibers. It\u2019s less expensive than wood, but it\u2019s also strong and easy to work with. Its smooth surface makes it a great choice if you plan on painting your cabinets. MDF comes in several different colors, so try to match the boards to the rest of the cabinets. Keep in mind that the material you choose determines what kind of tools you need. MDF requires a plywood-cutting blade for a circular or table saw. Use a wood-cutting saw if you\u2019re cutting wood. If you prefer authenticity or plan on staining the doors, you can use wood instead. Select hardwood, such as maple or beech. Plan on making the cabinet door about \u20444 in (1.9 cm) thick. Most hinges are designed for \u20444 in (1.9 cm) doors."

The installation process is easier when you install them over the cabinet, although they look more unique and stylish when set inside it. No matter what you choose, use a tape measure, note the dimensions, and then mark them on the material you plan on cutting. For doors that fit over cabinet openings, add about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) onto all of your measurements to account for the overlay."

Plywood is inexpensive compared to wood, but it will also keep your project lightweight, which makes assembling the various components much easier. Making this kind of door requires tools, some woodworking skill, and time to create, but it\u2019s very rewarding when done right. For the panel that fits between the boards, choose a piece of plywood about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick. The thickness doesn\u2019t have to be exact. As long as it is close to the recommended thickness, it will work."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Measure the cabinet opening to figure out what size the wood needs to be.",
          "description":"Measure the length and width of the opening. Panel doors fit over cabinet openings, so add an extra \u20442 in (1.3 cm) to each measurement to compensate for the overlay. Determine the horizontal rail length by adding the overlay to the length you measured. Determine the vertical stile length by adding the overlay to the height you measured. A panel door consists of 2 stiles, or side pieces, and 2 connecting rails on the top and bottom. The final part is a central panel that fits between everything else. The rails and stiles can be a wide as you desire, so try making them something like 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm). The central panel can be measured later. To determine its size, assemble the rails and stiles first, then measure the distance between them. For a basic cabinet, you could start with 1 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.30 m \u00d7 0.91 m) or 1 ft \u00d7 4 ft (0.30 m \u00d7 1.22 m) hardwood boards.

Leave off gloves, jewelry, long-sleeved shirts, or anything else that could get caught in a blade\u2019s teeth. Remember to also work outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. If you can\u2019t work outdoors, make sure you turn on any nearby ventilation fans or open doors and windows.

When you\u2019re ready, use a table saw or another good wood-cutting blade you have at your disposal. One way to get great cuts is to set up a scrap piece of wood in front of the table saw as a fence. Lock it in place with a c-clamp. When you need to cut something, use the fence as a brace to keep the wood steady and straight. The board used for the center part of the door does not have to be cut yet."

Plan on cutting a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) groove all the way down the inner edge of each stile board. Make these grooves on the rail boards as well, but also plan on cutting tongues on the end to fit into the stile grooves. This is known as a mortise and tenon joint. The tenons, which you will form on the rails, plug into the mortises on the stiles. The central panel also plugs into the mortises. Consider also labeling the boards so you know where they belong. For example, draw a triangle. Draw the top of the triangle on the top board, the left and right corners on the side boards, and the triangle base on the bottom board."

Most professional shops use a wood router, which you can push along the boards to easily cut thin, consistent slots. A stile router is an attachment for a table router that is specifically designed to cut mortises. If you\u2019re using a router, take your time and be sure to keep your fingers elevated. Cutting door frames is delicate work and can be dangerous if you\u2019re not careful. If you don\u2019t have a router, you could continue using a table saw instead.

Then, activate the blades to cut away the surrounding wood, leaving a tongue that will plug into the grooves you cut earlier. Make a tongue on both ends of each rail board. Fit the frame pieces back together when you\u2019re done. If they are the correct size, they will fit perfectly together. Trim the tongues gradually as needed to fit them."

Note that you may need to add several layers of stainer to bring the door to the color you desire. It\u2019s best to add small amounts at a time to avoid darkening the door too much.

    "It depends on how you want the cabinets to look.",
    "The installation process is easier when you install them over the cabinet, although they look more unique and stylish when set inside it.",
    "No matter what you choose, use a tape measure, note the dimensions, and then mark them on the material you plan on cutting.",
    "For doors that fit over cabinet openings, add about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) onto all of your measurements to account for the overlay.",
    "Put on a dust mask and protective glasses before operating a saw.",
    "MDF creates even more dust than wood.",
    "If you can, work outdoors or in another well-ventilated spot.",
    "Also, don\u2019t wear gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, jewelry, or anything else that could get caught by the blade.",
    "Put on ear protection as well to deal with the noise from the tools.",
    "To help ventilate your work space, turn on any nearby ventilation fans and open up doors and windows.",
    "Keep other people and pets out of the area until you\u2019re done working.",
    "Cut the door to size using a sharp wood-cutting saw.",
    "Use a circular saw and table saw if you have one.",
    "Handheld saws are also safe to use on wood.",
    "For MDF, select a carbide-tipped blade designed for plywood.",
    "Trim the board down gradually according to the measurements you made, then test fit the door in the frame.",
    "You may need to make several passes around the edges of the board to get it to the perfect size.",
    "Test fit it often to ensure it reaches the correct size.",
    "Rout the edges of the door to smooth them out.",
    "Cutting the material leaves a few rough edges.",
    "The best way to make the edges smooth and even is by using a wood router.",
    "Run the router over the edges until they feel consistent.",
    "Using a router can be dangerous, so be aware of your fingers.",
    "Keep them raised above the tool at all times.",
    "You may also be able to smooth a door out using an alternative like a 100-grit piece of sandpaper.",
    "Make additional doors for any other openings on the cabinet.",
    "Check the openings to make sure they are the same size.",
    "If they are different sizes, adjust your measurements accordingly.",
    "Get additional wood or MDF and cut it to fit over each opening.",
    "Then, rout and install all of them.",
    "Creating a Panel Door Select several pieces of damage-resistant plywood to create the door.",
    "Plan on using a hardwood type of plywood that can stand up to consistent use.",
    "Red oak is one example of material you might choose.",
    "Plywood is inexpensive compared to wood, but it will also keep your project lightweight, which makes assembling the various components much easier.",
    "Making this kind of door requires tools, some woodworking skill, and time to create, but it\u2019s very rewarding when done right.",
    "For the panel that fits between the boards, choose a piece of plywood about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick.",
    "The thickness doesn\u2019t have to be exact.",
    "As long as it is close to the recommended thickness, it will work.",
    "Measure the cabinet opening to figure out what size the wood needs to be.",
    "Measure the length and width of the opening.",
    "Panel doors fit over cabinet openings, so add an extra \u20442 in (1.3 cm) to each measurement to compensate for the overlay.",
    "Determine the horizontal rail length by adding the overlay to the length you measured.",
    "Determine the vertical stile length by adding the overlay to the height you measured.",
    "A panel door consists of 2 stiles, or side pieces, and 2 connecting rails on the top and bottom.",
    "The final part is a central panel that fits between everything else.",
    "The rails and stiles can be a wide as you desire, so try making them something like 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm).",
    "The central panel can be measured later.",
    "To determine its size, assemble the rails and stiles first, then measure the distance between them.",
    "For a basic cabinet, you could start with 1 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.30 m \u00d7 0.91 m) or 1 ft \u00d7 4 ft (0.30 m \u00d7 1.22 m) hardwood boards.",
    "Cut them to size so they match the length and width measurements you took.",
    "Put on a dust mask and safety glasses before cutting the wood.",
    "Expect plenty of wood dust and possibly wood shards during the cutting process.",
    "Consider wearing ear protection as well to deal with the noise from loud tools.",
    "Leave off gloves, jewelry, long-sleeved shirts, or anything else that could get caught in a blade\u2019s teeth.",
    "Remember to also work outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.",
    "If you can\u2019t work outdoors, make sure you turn on any nearby ventilation fans or open doors and windows.",
    "Keep other people and pets out of the area until you\u2019re done working and have had a chance to clean up.",
    "Cut the frame boards to size so they fit together.",
    "In a panel door, the finished boards fit together like a picture frame.",
    "Remember to account for the overlay by making the rail and stile boards wider by \u20442 in (1.3 cm).",
    "When you\u2019re ready, use a table saw or another good wood-cutting blade you have at your disposal.",
    "One way to get great cuts is to set up a scrap piece of wood in front of the table saw as a fence.",
    "Lock it in place with a c-clamp.",
    "When you need to cut something, use the fence as a brace to keep the wood steady and straight.",
    "The board used for the center part of the door does not have to be cut yet.",
    "Assemble and mark the door frame.",
    "Make sure all the pieces fit snugly together and trim them as needed.",
    "When you\u2019re done, start planning out the next cuts you need to make.",
    "Plan on cutting a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) groove all the way down the inner edge of each stile board.",
    "Make these grooves on the rail boards as well, but also plan on cutting tongues on the end to fit into the stile grooves.",
    "This is known as a mortise and tenon joint.",
    "The tenons, which you will form on the rails, plug into the mortises on the stiles.",
    "The central panel also plugs into the mortises.",
    "Consider also labeling the boards so you know where they belong.",
    "For example, draw a triangle.",
    "Draw the top of the triangle on the top board, the left and right corners on the side boards, and the triangle base on the bottom board.",
    "Cut grooves into the rail and stile boards with a stile router.",
    "Make the grooves along the side of each board.",
    "Make them about half as thick as the boards you are using, which is often a little more than \u20444 in (0.64 cm).",
    "Most professional shops use a wood router, which you can push along the boards to easily cut thin, consistent slots.",
    "A stile router is an attachment for a table router that is specifically designed to cut mortises.",
    "If you\u2019re using a router, take your time and be sure to keep your fingers elevated.",
    "Cutting door frames is delicate work and can be dangerous if you\u2019re not careful.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a router, you could continue using a table saw instead.",
    "You may need to make several passes in order to even out the mortises and get them to the correct depth.",
    "Cut matching tongues that fit into the grooves on the stiles.",
    "To make this part easier, choose a coping or stick bit for a table router if you have one.",
    "These attachments have a slot for you to fit a board into.",
    "Then, activate the blades to cut away the surrounding wood, leaving a tongue that will plug into the grooves you cut earlier.",
    "Make a tongue on both ends of each rail board.",
    "Fit the frame pieces back together when you\u2019re done.",
    "If they are the correct size, they will fit perfectly together.",
    "Trim the tongues gradually as needed to fit them.",
    "Measure the distance between the frame boards after assembling them.",
    "Set the assembled rails and stiles on a flat surface.",
    "Then, remove one of the stiles.",
    "Using a tape measure, measure the distance between the inner edge of the rail tongues.",
    "Measure the length of one of the rail boards, excluding the tongues, afterward.",
    "These measurements will be used for the center panel.",
    "It has to be trimmed to a perfect size to fit within the frame formed by the rails and stiles.",
    "Cut the central panel to fit between the rails and stiles.",
    "You can use a table saw or another wood-cutting saw for this.",
    "Trim the sides of the panel down gradually until it\u2019s the right size.",
    "Test it by sliding it into the grooves you cut into the sides of the rails.",
    "If you\u2019re uncertain about how much to cut off, keep the panel a little larger at first.",
    "Repeatedly test fit and trim it down until it fits.",
    "You can always trim a large panel, but you can\u2019t fix it once it\u2019s too small!",
    "Another option is to use 100-grit sandpaper to wear down the wood and also eliminate rough edges.",
    "Secure the boards together with wood glue after inserting the central panel.",
    "Take apart the frame to expose the grooves you made on the rails.",
    "If you are able to, use a squeezable bottle to make the glue easier to apply.",
    "After adding glue all along the grooves, fit the door pieces back together.",
    "Place a couple of bar clamps on the ends to keep everything squeezed together for about 24 hours.",
    "Dripping glue into the grooves is useful for reducing the amount of excess glue you have to clean up.",
    "If you have a spreadable glue, use a paint brush to coat the tongues and edges of the central board instead.",
    "Make absolutely sure the cabinet parts fit well together!",
    "Once the glue dries, they won\u2019t be easy to fix.",
    "Repeat the process to make more doors for the cabinets.",
    "Start with fresh material to cut and assemble the same way.",
    "Keep in mind that your cabinets may require different door sizes.",
    "Remember to measure the openings and cut the plywood to compensate for these differences.",
    "Finishing and Attaching Doors Sand the door if you plan on painting or staining it.",
    "MDF can be painted or stained just like wood.",
    "Use 220-grit sandpaper to abrade the entire door.",
    "Rub the entire door down with a gentle but consistent amount of pressure.",
    "The sandpaper slightly scuffs up the finish so paint adheres to it better.",
    "Most MDF doors are painted instead of stained.",
    "MDF doesn\u2019t have fibers like wood does, so it doesn\u2019t stain as well.",
    "You don\u2019t have to do either if you prefer the way the door looks.",
    "Paint MDF to give it a colorful but damage-resistant finish.",
    "Keep your dust mask and protective goggles on while painting.",
    "Brush the paint over the entire door in a single, consistent layer.",
    "After letting that layer dry, flip the door over to paint the other side.",
    "You may need to add 2 or 3 layers to perfect the finish.",
    "Latex and oil-based paints are good options for cabinets.",
    "Usually, latex is preferable since it\u2019s very water-resistant and dries much quicker.",
    "Oil-based paints are a little more expensive but can be more durable in the long-run.",
    "Let the paint dry after each subsequent layer.",
    "Paint can take 8 hours or longer to dry completely.",
    "Refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for more specific information.",
    "Stain wood if you wish to make it darker and water-resistant.",
    "In addition to your dust mask and goggles, put on rubber gloves.",
    "Wood stainer is like a gel that you can apply over wood with a foam brush or rag.",
    "Rub it into the wood in a single layer to work it into the grain, coloring it.",
    "After it dries, flip the door over to finish the other side.",
    "Note that you may need to add several layers of stainer to bring the door to the color you desire.",
    "It\u2019s best to add small amounts at a time to avoid darkening the door too much.",
    "MDF doesn\u2019t have wood fibers, so it isn\u2019t great when stained.",
    "Although it can be stained, the finish often doesn\u2019t look as good as it would with authentic wood.",
    "Install hinges to attach the door to the cabinet frame.",
    "Use a pair of cabinet hinges, placing them near the top and bottom along one of the door\u2019s longer edges.",
    "Hinges screw directly into the door and frame.",
    "The screws will be included with the hinges.",
    "Tighten them, then check that the door opens and closes properly to finish.",
    "Note that there are several types of hinges you can choose from.",
    "Butt hinges are the common type you see on most doors, but there are also long European-style hinges that are easier to use for adjusting the door\u2019s placement They are all installed the same basic way.",
    "Screw the hinges to the cabinets to install the doors.",
    "Fit the door onto the frame, making sure the hinges are an equal distance from its top and bottom.",
    "Mark the hinge location on the frame as needed.",
    "Once you\u2019re sure the door is where you want it, begin screwing it in place.",
    "Most hinges come with screws to be used with a Phillips screwdriver."
