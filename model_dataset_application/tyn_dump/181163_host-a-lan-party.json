      "description":"The garage is perfect for smaller LAN parties. You can usually fit about 20 gamers in the average size 2-car garage. If you need more room, start looking for large meeting halls. Try asking around at local colleges, churches, Elks lodges, and other public spaces. Finding free space is best, but if no owners are willing, then a hotel meeting room may be your best option. It can cost a lot of money, but they will be able to provide you with reliable power, air conditioning, and even tables and chairs."

      "headline":"Acquire all the necessary networking equipment.",
      "description":"You will need at minimum a router (ex: Linksys BEFSR41 or D-Link EBR-2310). Most routers only have 4 network ports, so if you plan to have more than 3 people over, then may also need a switch (ex: Linksys EZXS16W or D-Link DES-1024D). You should have 1 network port per person. 10/100BaseT equipment is more than adequate for gaming, although gigabit speeds are nice for fast file transfers. However, if you want to save money (and who doesn't? ), you can find cheap 48-port 10/100 switches on eBay. The switch plugs into the router, and all the gamers plug into the switch. Some network guidelines depending on the size of your LAN party follow:\nUp to 10 PCs - You will need a network card for every PC, a small 100BASE-TX Ethernet switch, and at least 2 100BASE-TX network cables; you may be able to purchase a network starter kit. 11 - 40 PCs - Get 100BASE-TX switches with enough ports for all your guests (or multiple switches with linkup ports) and enough cables to connect the computers to the switches. To save time and headaches, ask guests to have their network cards installed and configured and TCP/IP protocol installed before they show up. They should also bring their own switches and cables, but you should have some extra just in case. 41 - 200 PCs - In addition to the previously listed equipment, you will need switches (preferably 10/100, at least one port for each 40 people) and dedicated servers in order to avoid a lag. Consider running all your servers on 100 Base-TX, or a gigabit network."

      "headline":"Acquire all the necessary power equipment.",
      "description":"If you overload your circuits, the circuit breaker will trip and the pressure will be on for you to fix it on the spot. The best solution is to be prepared. If hosting in your garage or house, you will need extension cords to run from electrical sockets around the house. This is because you can only plug so many computers into one circuit. To determine which sockets are on which circuits, you will need to go out to the circuit breaker box. If you are lucky, then the circuits are labeled. If not, you will need a 2nd person in the house who can tell you which room's lights go out when you flip off each circuit. If you are at a hotel venue or using a generator (see Tips), you will be provided with distribution boxes, which have multiple 20 amp circuits. A good guideline is 4 gamers on a 15 amp circuit and 6 gamers on a 20 amp circuit. Run extension cords to each table to evenly distribute power, and make sure the gamers know which plug they should plug into. It's a good idea to check every circuit and map it out on a piece of paper, hand out a copy to everyone, and label each outlet. Be careful with refrigerators and air conditioning being on the same circuit as PCs. When their compressors turn on, they draw a lot of power."

      "headline":"Acquire seating.",
      "description":"For a small LAN, your dining table and desk may be all you need. For a garage LAN, you may have to rent some folding tables and chairs. Your local party rental store will be able to help you out for less than $100. 6 foot (1.8 m) tables are the perfect size for 2 gamers. 8 foot (2.4 m) tables can fit 3 gamers with a bit of a squeeze. As already mentioned, hotel meeting rooms will have tables and chairs already available for you."

      "description":"Choose a variety of game styles (FPS, RTS, Racing). Keep in mind that choosing only the newest games will alienate gamers with older PCs. If you are planning a tournament, decide the game, format, rules, and maps. You may want to run software like LanHUB or Autonomous LAN Party, which helps you track the tournament ladders."
