  "text":" Choosing Mint Varieties Choose peppermint if you want a brighter, strong flavor for tea or general use.  Pick spearmint if your garden, patio or windows get a lot of light and heat throughout the year. It is used very commonly in the Southern United States. Plant pineapple mint if you need to plant mint next to other plants. It is one of the less invasive species of mint. Opt for lemon mint if you like a refreshing citrus flavor in lemonade or iced tea.  Try apple mint for a more subtle flavor with fresh apple hints. This variety is popular in fresh salads and drinks. Starting a Mint Plant Go to your garden supply store to buy a mint seedling. Mint does not germinate from seed too easily, so only the most experienced gardeners should start from seed. Plant directly into potting soil or compost after you bring it home. A garden store will have more varieties of mint; however, you may be able to find mint seedlings and plants at your local farmer\u2019s market and supermarket.

Wait until the white roots grow several inches long before planting. They can even extend to the bottom of your pot depth. Choosing a Pot Shop for a pot that is at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. A mint plant needs plenty of space to grow. Choose a pot with drainage holes in the bottom. A mint plant thrives in well-drained soil. Purchase a saucer to place below the pot to avoid staining your windowsill or patio. Purchase an additional, much larger, pot if you want to pot mint and other herbs together. You can submerge the whole 12-inch pot in a larger pot, next to other herbs. Keep in mind that many species of mint will still find a way to take over the entire pot through the holes in the bottom of the mint pot. If you want to plant it with other herbs, you will want to separate the herbs later in the season. Planting Mint in a Pot Purchase gritty compost from a local gardening store. You can also combine potting soil with rich compost. Mint plants need rich and well-drained soil to thrive. Fill the lower third of the pot with compost and potting soil.  Set your mint cutting or seedling in the pot. Curl the roots if they are too long for the pot. Fill in the area around the mint with potting soil.

Caring for Mint Pots Water the soil so that it sinks down to the roots. Water it whenever it is dry for the first year. It should always have moist soil. If you experience hot weather, you may need to water it several times per day. Keep it in an east-facing location.
