Wiring Procedure for 2 Cables (4 to 6 wires) One cable (or pair of wires) typically supplies power to the first outlet device and the other carries power to other devices further down the line. You will need to determine which is which. There are many ways to determine which cable is the \"supply\", using various test instruments (contact, non-contact, meters, etc). The following technique is for those who are unfamiliar with such things or who do not wish to touch the wiring while it is \"live\". Detach 1 white \"neutral\" and 1 black \"hot\" wire from one of the two cables and put a wire cap on each of them. Ensure the wires come from the same cable or conduit. Reinstall the receptacle into the electrical box and restore power at the main fuse or breaker box.  Plug in a night light or other device and press the \"Reset\" button (if necessary) to determine if power is flowing into the receptacle.

Attach your \"line\" black wire to the brass \"hot\" terminal of the \"line\" section of the GFCI. Remove the yellow sticker (or other colored tape) that covers the \"load\" terminals on the receptacle. You will hook your remaining circuit wires to these terminals. Connect your \"load\" white wire to the silver \"load\" terminal and your \"load\" black wire to the \"hot\" brass \"load\" terminal.

    "If you intend to work on more than a few of these, you may want to obtain a handy \"outlet polarity and GFCI tester\" at the home improvement store.",
    "It plugs into the GFCI and has lights that confirm power is on, the proper wiring polarity and ground, and may be obtained with a GFCI test button to verify the GFCI mechanism operates in each downstream receptacle.",

    "Adding GFCI at Service Panel Consider whether you need a GFCI circuit breaker.",
    "In some cases it may be best to have an electrician install a GFCI circuit breaker in the panel, rather than a GFCI receptacle.",
    "The GFCI breaker has a protected \"hot\" conductor, a separate neutral connection, as well as a test and reset button.",
    "It will protect all devices on that entire branch, if properly installed.",
    "Don't attempt this one as a DIY job if you don't have extensive electrical experience.",
    "It can be very dangerous to work on exposed circuit breakers, even if you believe the main breaker (or feed) has been disconnected.",
    "Some newer installations may require an AFCI breaker as well as GFCI protection for some circuit branches.",
    "Combination AFCI/GFCI breakers may be an elegant way to solve that  complicated problem."
