          "description":"Resin is a thick liquid that easily traps bubbles when it\u2019s exposed to air. To encourage the bubbles to rise, you\u2019ll use a combination of heat, slow mixing, and careful pouring. To help all of your materials warm up, turn the heat on if you\u2019re working indoors. It doesn\u2019t need to be burning up, but raising the temperature to 74\u201378 \u00b0F (23\u201326 \u00b0C) can really promote the bubbles to rise out of the resin. Air bubbles in resin are just trapped pockets of air. Hot air rises. If you can heat the bubbles, they\u2019ll naturally lift out on their own."

          "description":"Get a small bowl or tray that will hold your bottles of resin. Turn the tap water in your sink to the hottest temperature. After your water warms up, fill the container with warm water. Set it down and place your bottles in the water. Let the resin soak for 10-15 minutes to warm the containers up. If you\u2019re using resin with a dye in it, use lukewarm water instead. For some brands of dyed resin, hot water can cause the pigment and resin to separate."

          "headline":"Warm your pouring cup before pouring your resin in.",
          "description":"Most people mix and pour resin out of a dedicated glass container with a spout to make the process easier. If you aren\u2019t pouring your resin directly out of the bottle, take your pouring cup and set it in a tray or bowl of warm water the same way that you soaked your resin. Let it soak for 10-15 minutes to heat it up.Tip: It is highly recommended that you use a wide-mouthed cup or beaker to pour resin. You can\u2019t mix resin in the container that it came in, and mixing the resin ensures that it creates an even, uniform texture. Most resins need to be mixed anyway to be activated. Do not fill the inside of the cup with water to avoid contaminating your resin."

Slowly pour your resin into the cup by tilting it at a 45-degree angle 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) away from the bottom of the cup. Squeeze your resin out in a circular pattern around the bottom of the cup. Pouring the resin slowly ensures that it doesn\u2019t catch any air underneath it as it fills the pouring cup.

Be careful to avoid spilling water into the cup, though."

After 3 minutes, take your pouring cup to the area where you\u2019re applying your resin. Mixing, heating, and letting your resin rest should all work to remove a vast majority of the bubbles in your resin."
