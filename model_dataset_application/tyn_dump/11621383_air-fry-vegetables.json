          "description":"If you'd like, you can play around a little with the temperature of your air fryer for cooking vegetables, but in general, a temp of about 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) will work for air-frying vegetables. However, if you find your food is cooking a little too fast, you can bump the temperature down to about 360 \u00b0F (182 \u00b0C), and just add 1-2 minutes to the cooking time if it's needed. One advantage of using an air fryer over a conventional oven is that an air fryer preheats very quickly, so you can wait to preheat it until about 3-5 minutes before you're ready to cook."

          "description":"You can cook almost any veggie you can imagine in your air fryer, from potatoes, carrots, and yams to broccoli, peppers, and zucchini. You can air fry frozen vegetables, as well. Just open the bag and pour them into a bowl to season them, then cook the same way as fresh veggies. Air-frying veggies is quick and healthy, so this is perfect for a weeknight side dish, or even an afternoon snack!"

        {
          "headline":"Peel and cut larger veggies into 1 in (2.5 cm) pieces.",
          "description":"If you're cooking a larger vegetable like potatoes, sweet potatoes, or squash, you'll likely need to cut them into bite-sized pieces. If you want to remove the skin, place the edge of a knife or a vegetable peeler at the top of the food you're preparing, then drag it firmly down to slice away the peel, if you'd like. Then, place your veggies on a sturdy cutting board and cut them into cubes, sticks, or slices\u2014whatever shape you prefer! For instance, you might slice carrots into 1 in (2.5 cm) rounds, while you might cut a sweet potato into large cubes. Don't cut the vegetables too thin. If you're cooking potatoes, for instance, you might dice them or cut them into French fries or steak fries, but shoestring cuts will tend to burn quickly in an air fryer. If you're working with smaller vegetables, like baby carrots, brussels sprouts, or broccoli, or if you want to serve the vegetables whole, like carrots or ears of corn, you don't have to cut them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Toss your vegetables in oil and your choice of seasonings.",
          "description":"Place your sliced veggies in a large bowl and pour in about 2  tsp (9.9 mL) of olive or vegetable oil. Sprinkle in 1/4 tsp (1.5 g) of salt and 1/4 tsp (0.5 g) of pepper, or whatever seasonings you want to use. Then, gently toss the vegetables in the bowl to coat them evenly. Choose seasonings that will complement the dish you're making! For instance, if you're serving your veggies alongside lasagna, you might use 1/4 tsp (1.5 g) of salt and 1/2 tsp (7 g) of Italian seasoning. If you're serving grilled hamburgers or ribs, you might mix 1/2 tsp (1.5 g) of salt and 1/2 tsp (0.9 g) of smoked paprika and sprinkle the mixture on the vegetables. Consider how the seasoning will go with the vegetable you're eating, as well. For instance, if you're making sweet potatoes, you might sprinkle them with brown sugar and cinnamon for a sweet treat, or you might use salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne if you'd prefer a more savory side."

        {
          "headline":"Place the veggies in a single layer in your air fryer basket.",
          "description":"Slide the basket out of your air fryer and shake in some of your vegetables. Spread them across the bottom of the basket. Depending on the size of your vegetable pieces and your air fryer basket, you'll probably need to split them into 2 batches. If you overcrowd the basket, your vegetables won't crisp up properly or evenly."

        {
          "headline":"Cook the veggies for 10-20 minutes, shaking the basket every 5 minutes.",
          "description":"As you saute the vegetables in the air fryer, give them a good shake every 5 minutes or so. That will help ensure that they cook more evenly. Thicker, denser veggies, like potatoes, carrots, and Brussels sprouts will take longer to cook. Soft or thin vegetables, like asparagus or bell peppers, will cook faster. Also, the larger you cut your veggies, the longer they'll take to cook. Check the vegetables frequently as they near the end of their cooking time, as they can go from just-done to overcooked quickly. When the veggies are browned and tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork, they're ready to come out of the air fryer.Tip: Be sure to set the timer on your air fryer so you don't lose track of time!"

However, if you're making multiple batches, cover the first batch tightly to keep them warm while the next batch finishes."
