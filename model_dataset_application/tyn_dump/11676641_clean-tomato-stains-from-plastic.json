          "description":"If you have pesky tomato stains on one of your plastic food-storage containers, the easiest way to clean it is with distilled white vinegar and water. Take your plastic container and fill it halfway with water. Then, fill the remainder of the container with white vinegar. Let the container soak for 12-24 hours. Rinse the container in water when you\u2019re done soaking it to remove your tomato stains.If you have a plastic spatula or some other plastic item, you can soak it in a glass filled with 1-part white vinegar and 1-part water. This method will work for basically any colored-food stain that remains after standard dishwashing."

          "description":"Take a regular lemon and cut it in half widthwise. Then, set your plastic item down on a plate or cutting board. Grab half of your lemon and hold it with the cut side facing the stain. Rub the cut side into the stained area by scrubbing it back and forth across the stained area. Squeeze the lemon gently as you scrub to release more lemon juice. Continue rubbing for 30-60 seconds. Rinse the stain off with water when you\u2019re done.Wear rubber gloves if you have any cuts on your hands or don\u2019t want your fingers to smell like lemon. This may work to remove oily tomato residue as well, since lemon juice is fairly good at fighting grease."

          "description":"Put on some rubber gloves. Pour 1-2 teaspoons (4-8 grams) of baking soda over your stain based on its size. Then, pour 0.5\u20131 cup (120\u2013240 mL) of white vinegar on top of the baking soda. The mixture will immediately foam up and expand. Scrub the surface with a stiff-bristled brush or sponge until the stain disappears. Rinse and wash the mixture off when you\u2019re done before hand- or machine-washing the plastic item.Baking soda and vinegar react quite quickly with one another. This foaming action creates a lot of bubbles and fizz, so do so near the bottom of your sink to avoid making a mess."

Pour 1-2 teaspoons (4-8 grams) of baking soda over your plastic. Then, add 1\u20132 tablespoons (15\u201330 mL) of water. Mix the water and baking soda with a spoon or by hand until it forms a thick paste. Then, rub the baking soda paste into the stain and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Rinse and wash your plastic container or utensil after the stain is gone.If the stain is especially old or pungent, feel free to leave the baking soda paste on the surface of the stain for longer. The longer the baking soda rests, the more efficient the stain removal will be."

Fill the glass or bowl with hydrogen peroxide until the item is completely submerged. Let it soak for 6-24 hours depending on tough the stain is. After the stain is gone, rinse and wash the plastic item thoroughly. Clean it at least 2-3 times and machine-wash it if you have a dishwasher.Warning: It\u2019s extremely important that you wash the plastic item thoroughly if you do this.
