          "description":"First, figure out how big you want your print to be. Keep in mind that the piece of flashing can\u2019t be larger than the feed on your inkjet printer. Then, use measuring tape and a straightedge to measure and draw lines where you need to cut the flashing. Cut along the lines with the tin snips until the flashing is cut to size."

          "description":"You need to sand the flashing before printing onto it to remove the protective top coat. Otherwise, the ink from the printer won\u2019t stick. Use a sanding block or random orbital sander so you don\u2019t leave scratches on the flashing. You only need to sand the side you\u2019re going to print onto. Going over the surface of the flashing with the sander a few times should be enough to remove the top coat. Sand your flashing outside if possible so the leftover dusty residue doesn\u2019t get everywhere in your home."

Try using a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser or a sponge with dish detergent and water."

To apply the precoat, tape the back of the flashing to a flat surface using double-sided tape. Then, pour a liberal amount of precoat in a line across the top edge of the flashing. Use a straightedge or coating bar to slowly scrape the coating down across the whole surface of the flashing. When you\u2019re finished, there should be a smooth, even layer of inkjet precoat over the side of the flashing you\u2019re going to print on. You can find inkjet precoat online or at your local art supply store."

Lay the flashing flat on a piece of paper and tape the edges to the paper using masking tape. If the flashing is the same size as the paper, you'll need to curl the tape over the edges of the paper.
