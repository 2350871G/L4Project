If the distance between your brackets doesn\u2019t line up with your stud pattern, install at least 1 of your brackets over a stud. If you have to choose between hanging a bracket on the end of the shelf on a stud and hanging a bracket in the middle on a stud, go with the bracket in the middle.

Your wall anchor must match the size of the screw, so check the acceptable screw sizes on the packaging before you buy wall anchors. Choosing a Wall Anchor:\nThreaded drywall anchors look like screw-shaped pieces of plastic with threading on the outside. They generally hold 25\u201375 pounds (11\u201334 kg) and they\u2019re perfect for studs. Expansion anchors will typically hold 25\u201355 pounds (11\u201325 kg). These look like bullet-shaped pieces of ridged plastic, and they\u2019re ideal for hollow drywall and masonry. Toggle anchors can hold over 100 pounds (45 kg). They look like metal rods with an adjustable rod on the end. These are really only necessary if your shelving is extremely heavy and you\u2019re drilling into hollow drywall or concrete."
