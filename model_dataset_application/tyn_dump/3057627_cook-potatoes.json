You can roast any type of potato. Floury potatoes, such as Russets, will have light, fluffy centers after roasting while waxy potatoes, such as yellow or red potatoes, have a rich, deep flavor."

          "description":"Take a sharp knife and carefully cut each potato in half. If you're preparing new potatoes that are small, you might not need to cut them further. For larger potatoes, continue to cut the potatoes until they're in even 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Tip: Don't cut the potatoes if you'd like to make classic baked potatoes. Instead, leave them whole and roast them for 50 to 60 minutes. For very tender potatoes, peel them before you cut them. If you'd like to make fancy Hasselback-style potatoes, keep the potatoes whole but make thin slices across the surface of each potato. They'll fan out and become crisp as you roast the potatoes."

    "If you prefer, use a knife or mandoline to slice the potatoes into \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) thick pieces.",
    "You could also cut the potatoes into cubes that are about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide.Tip: If you'd like to make classic french fries, slice the potatoes into long, thin sticks and deep fry them on the stove until they're crispy.",
    "Use caution when slicing with a mandoline since it's easy to cut yourself on the sharp blade.",
    "Melt butter in a deep skillet over medium heat.",
    "Put 2 to 3 tablespoons (28 to 42 g) of butter into the skillet and turn the burner to medium.",
    "Let the butter melt completely and tilt the pan so the butter coats the bottom.Tip: If you'd like to fry the onions with the potatoes, add 1/2 of a diced onion to the skillet when you melt the butter.",
    "Cook the onion for 5 to 10 minutes before you add the potatoes.",
    "You can also fry diced bell peppers or mushrooms along with the potatoes for a hearty breakfast.",
    "Add the potatoes to the skillet and season them with salt and pepper.",
    "Arrange the potatoes in the skillet so they're evenly spread over the bottom.",
    "Then, sprinkle as much salt and pepper as you like over them.",
    "If you'd like to double this recipe, cook the potatoes in batches.",
    "You could season the potatoes with garlic salt or onion powder according to your taste.",
    "Cover the skillet and cook the potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "Put the lid on the skillet and cook the potatoes until they become tender.",
    "Wear oven mitts to take the lid off and stir the potatoes every 3 to 5 minutes so they cook evenly.Use a flat spatula or spoon to stir the potatoes.",
    "Fry the uncovered potatoes for 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Take the lid off of the skillet once the potatoes have softened.",
    "Cook them until they're as crisp on the outside as you like.",
    "Then, turn off the burner and season the potatoes with more salt and pepper.Remember to stir the potatoes frequently so they don't burn on 1 side.",
