Then, add about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to your measurement so you can add a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance to each end of the strap. If you're following a sewing pattern, follow it's measurement recommendations for the strap sizes. If you have a garment that has straps, you could measure these instead."

Take a piece of \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) wide rubber elastic and cut it so it's as long as your new measurement.Tip: Rubber elastic won't wear out if you expose it to saltwater or chlorine, which is why it's perfect for swimsuit straps. If you're not sewing the straps to swimwear, use rubber, knitted, or woven elastic. For example, if you're making a strap that's 15 inches (38 cm) long, multiply this by 2 and cut a strip of rubber elastic so it's 30 inches (76 cm) long."
