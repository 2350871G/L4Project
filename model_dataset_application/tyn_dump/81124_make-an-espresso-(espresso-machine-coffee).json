Roast levels can vary by region, so try several to find a level that you enjoy the most. Keep in mind that you might prefer different roasts for different purposes. For example, if you're drinking the espresso straight, you might want a single-origin bean that's not roasted very dark. Or if you'll be making the espresso into a latte or cappuccino, you might want a darker roast that will stand up to the milk."

While you want fresh beans, you don't want beans that were roasted within the last day or two, since they'll still be releasing carbon dioxide. Purchase and use beans that were roasted 5 to 12 days earlier. If you're buying your beans from a store, check the label on the bag to find the roast date."

          "description":"If you have a high-quality burr grinder, use it to grind enough beans for one espresso shot. The burrs will do a better job of grinding the beans than a cheap metal blade. Grind the espresso on one of the finest settings, so the beans are as fine as granulated sugar. Grind enough beans to get about 7 grams of espresso. You'll use this to pull one 1-ounce (30 ml) shot. Or you could use 14 grams to make a double shot. If the beans are ground too coarsely, the water will run through them too quickly, so the flavor won't develop. If they're too fine, the shot will pull for too long which could make the espresso bitter. If you don't have a grinder, you can ask your local coffee shop to grind the beans on their espresso setting."

Try to use the leftover espresso as soon as you can, since the espresso will lose its flavor the longer it's stored. Avoid storing the espresso or beans in a refrigerator or freezer. These spaces can introduce moisture which will damage your beans."

If your machine isn't connected to a water source, pour water into the tank and ensure that the portafilter is in the machine. Turn the machine on to pull a blank shot of water through the brew head and into an espresso cup or shot glass. While all machines are different, you'll just need to practice to learn the specifics of using your machine. Read your espresso machine's manual to learn how it should be used.

The machine should heat the water between 197 and 204 degrees F (92 and 96 C). Properly heated water is important to extract all of the flavor compounds of the espresso. Avoid using tap water because it contains minerals that can clog your espresso machine over time. If you use tap water, you'll need to descale your machine frequently."

To tamp, grip the handle of the tamp and turn your arm so your elbow is at a 90-degree angle. Set the portafilter on a level surface and push down evenly, so you're putting about 30 pounds of pressure on the coffee. Don't set the clean portafilter on a counter that's got coffee grounds on it. You don't need to knock the outside of the portafilter after you've tamped the espresso. This will create small cracks in the packed espresso puck and can prevent good flavor from developing."
