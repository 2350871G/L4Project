Then, smell the base of the pineapple to tell if it's fragrant and sweet. If you can't smell the pineapple at all, it's not ripe enough. If you're using a plastic cutting board, lay a kitchen towel underneath it to prevent the board from sliding around as you cut."

Use a large knife to carefully slice off the end with the prickly leaves. The leaves are called the crown. Tip: Set the crown aside if you'd like to use it to decorate a fruit platter. You could place it in the center of a platter and arrange chopped pineapple and other fresh fruit around it. Use a chef's knife or serrated bread knife."
