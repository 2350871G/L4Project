Ultrasonic humidifiers use vibrations to release moisture into the air. Since these come in both cool and warm mist variations, they are a good choice for a home with children.

Some humidifiers have a small space that allows you to add things like essential oils or vapor rub to the mist. This would be the time to add those items if desired. However, if your humidifier doesn\u2019t explicitly say that it is compatible with those items, don\u2019t use them. Recommended humidity levels are normally between 30\u201350%.
