Painting all of the edges in the room, also known as \u201ccutting in,\u201d should be done before painting the walls entirely. Use an angled paint brush to carefully paint the corners and edges.

After the edges you painted are all dry, it's time to add a second coat. Try to paint nice, even coats so that you won't have to go back up the ladder to do touch ups later on. Applying the Paint Attach your paint roller to an extension pole. Once your roller is ready for use after sliding the roller cover onto the roller frame, attach it to an extension pole. The bottom of most rollers are able to screw onto the extension pole, making attaching it very simple. Paint the wall beginning at the top and working your way down.
