While you can make custards without one, professional pastry chefs know that this little trick will make better custards every time. Cutting the vanilla pod in half and remove the seeds, saving for later. A shallow cut all the way down the pod should allow you to gently pry the pod open. Save both the husks and the beans inside.

It can be severed with berries, on it's own, or stuffed into pastries, like eclairs. Fine-Tuning Your Custard Recipe Add more egg yolks for a richer custard, adding a bit more sugar for each egg. There are some recipes that call for as many as six eggs, which have a deep yellow color and thicker body. If you add more eggs, be sure to add a bit more sugar as well, about a tablespoon. An extra teaspoon of cornstarch, too, can help keep the custard together. Consider adding another flavor to your custard with extracts and liquors. A simple teaspoon of almond or cherry extract will quickly change the flavor profile of your desert. Similarly, a touch or spiced rum, chocolate liquor, or other strongly-flavored alcohols have long been used in custards. Add it after you've mixed the egg yolks in and stir well. Add 1-2 tablespoons of butter for a clean, pastry-shop sheen to your custard. The butter goes in towards the end, after you mixed in the eggs and the milk mixture. Simply stir it in until melted. Add 2 teaspoons instant coffee or cocoa powder (or both). Add these with the corn starch in the beginning and mix well.
