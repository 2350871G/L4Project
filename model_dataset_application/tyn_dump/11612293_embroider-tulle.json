Likewise, patterns that feature heavily-stitched areas can weigh down tulle fabric, so it\u2019s best to avoid these as well.Try choosing a design that feature delicate flowers or a lace-like pattern."

Check the needle\u2019s package for these numbers and the word \u201csharp\u201d to ensure that you have the right size and type.Tip: Unlike ballpoint needles that squeeze between fibers, sharp needles will pierce through them. However, you will be sewing through the gaps in the tulle rather than through the fibers, and the sharp, pointed end will come in handy for getting through these narrow spaces."
