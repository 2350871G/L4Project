  "text":" Using an Embroidery Eraser Purchase an embroidery eraser or a stitch eraser. You can find this product online or in a well-stocked fabric store. It looks a little like a pair of trimmers for beards. It is ideal for professional-quality embroidery, such as logos on jackets, shirts, and caps.
