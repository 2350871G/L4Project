          "description":"Lay out your water hose on a flat surface and try to make it as straight as possible. Use a tape measure to find the length of the hose from one end to the other. Write down the length of the hose so you can easily remember it later. If you're using a new hose for your RV, look on the packaging to determine how long it is. You only need to measure the length of the hose that connects to your water supply."

          "headline":"Tape heat cable every 1 ft (30 cm) along the hose.",
          "description":"Heat cable detects the temperature of the hose and heats it up if it gets too cold. Get a heat cable that matches the length of your hose and secure the sensor with electrical tape so it's pressed against the hose. Run the cable parallel with the hose and wrap electrical tape around it every 1 foot (30 cm) so it stays in place. You can buy heat cables from hardware stores or specialty camping stores. Use heat cables whenever you stay in an area that is colder than 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C). Most RV sites in colder climates already have insulation around the supply lines. If the water supply line at your campsite doesn't already have insulation, you may need to wrap heat cable around it as well.Warning: Avoid coiling the heat cable around the hose since it could make areas too hot and cause damage to the hose."

          "headline":"Cover the hose and heat cable with foam insulation tubes.",
          "description":"Once the heat tube is secured, get enough foam insulation tubes to match the length of your hose. Pull the side of the foam tubing apart so you can put your hose inside of it. Press the opening in the side of the tubing together so the hose isn't exposed and use duct tape every 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) to hold it in place. You can buy foam tube insulation from hardware stores. Foam insulation also comes in pieces at 90-degree angles so you can insulate the port where your water hose connects to the RV. Some foam tubes are self-adhesive so you don't need to use tape."

          "description":"Pipe insulation tape has a foil-like exterior and adheres to itself to prevent heat from escaping. Start wrapping near the end of the hose, overlapping the tape by about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) with each coil. Continue wrapping the tape around the foam tubing until you reach the other end of the hose. You can buy insulation tape from your local hardware store. If you don't have insulation tape, you can also wrap aluminum foil around the tubing and duct tape it every 1 foot (30 cm) to hold it in place."

Use insulating foam boards around the perimeter of your RV so it doesn't get cold underneath. Make sure the foam boards fit snugly under your RV or else they won't be as effective. You can buy insulating foam boards from your local hardware store. Some specialty RV stores may sell skirts that you can easily attach and store away when you're not using it.

While some of these compartments may be heated when you run your RV, they may still freeze if it gets too cold. Plug in a small space heater or heat lamp in the compartment to keep it warm or else your valves could freeze and prevent water from running through them. Make sure the heater or lamp is unplugged when you aren't using it. If your tanks are outside or exposed, you may not be able to use a heater or lamp to keep them thawed.Tip: If the valves do freeze, try pouring a small amount of hot water on them or using a heat gun to melt anything that's frozen."

          "description":"Since water expands when it freezes, it could cause the hose to stretch or burst in areas. Inspect the hose for any areas that are cracked, split, or weak to make sure it's still safe to use. If you don't find any damage, attach the hose back onto the water lines when you need more. If there is damage, you'll need to get a different hose for your water supply.Tip: Keep a spare water hose in your RV storage compartments in case your primary hose is damaged."
