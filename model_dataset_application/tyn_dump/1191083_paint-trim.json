If you paint your trim indoors, you don\u2019t have to take extra time to remove it from the walls.

For painting, you will need a few high quality paintbrushes proportionate in size to the trim you are painting, foam rollers, and a durable paint. You may choose to use a sealer to finish the trim at the end, as well. Although you may spend more at the start, it will be worth it to buy quality materials for your project. Your trim will look better and last longer if you do. You\u2019ll need to calculate the amount of paint you need based on the total space of all the trim you\u2019re painting.

          "description":"Sanding trim will help to remove any oily coating on the wood that might prevent your paint from sticking, and will give a clean, smooth base for your new paint to be applied to. Sanding is an especially important step when you are painting over old trim that is previously stained or painted, or new trim that has a glossy sealer over the top. If you\u2019re working with trim with many layers of paint, start with an 80-grit sandpaper and smooth down the wood. Move to 100-grit sandpaper after that, and finish with 120-grit sandpaper for a smooth base. If you\u2019re working with trim that is relatively free of stain or paint, you can start with just 120-grit sandpaper. You\u2019ll need to take extra time to sand down sections of trim that have curves or decorative edges."

Realize early on that patience with the first coat of paint will greatly improve the overall look of your trim when completed. Start by pouring your paint into a tray or bucket. Saturate your brush with paint, and wipe off any extra that might be dripping. Start in the center of the trim, and brush back and forth in the same direction, horizontally. When you\u2019ve finished painting a piece of trim, use a foam roller to go over the top of the paint to reduce the appearance of brushstrokes. As you add paint along the rest of the trim, spend time blending the edges of different paint patches together so as to reduce the appearance of brushstrokes. If you\u2019re painting your trim indoors, you\u2019ll need to \u2018cut in\u2019 the trim - meaning, carefully paint along the edge where the trim meets the wall/floor. Paint the center section of the trim after the edges. Wait several hours (or days, if using oil paint) for your first layer to dry completely before moving onto the second coat."

Work along the trim, using the same painting technique as you did for the first layer. You should paint all of the trim with a second coat, even if the first coat looks like it covered everything. Simply filling in patchy areas may seem like a good shortcut, but it will typically leave you with a blotchy end-job. Use your foam roller to smooth out any visible brushstrokes along the trim, when you\u2019re finished."

Caulking will seal any gaps between the trim and the wall, both protecting it from damage and giving it a more finished look. Carefully spread your caulk around the seam between the trim and the wall. Use your finger as you go, to spread the caulk into the crevice and seal the gap more evenly. Use a damp rag to clean the nozzle on the caulk gun to prevent it from clogging, and to wipe your dirty hands on. You should always use a caulk that is close in color to your trim - typically white. The idea is that the caulk will blend in seamlessly. Wait for the caulk to dry several hours before returning furniture to its original locations."
