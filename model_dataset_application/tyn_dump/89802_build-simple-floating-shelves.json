Pre-drill 1/4-inch-diameter holes at the stud locations. Hold the cleat straight against the line on the wall. Drill into the stud with a 1/8-in. bit and install a 1/4-in. x 3-1/2 in. lag screw into each stud. Make sure the screw is tight and straight. Cut away the corrugated cardboard cores at least 1-1/2 inches from the cut edge. Use a bread knife works to scrape off the glue, being careful not to gouge the wood. Test-fit the shelf. The blank should fit over the cleat. If the shelf doesn't lay tight against the wall, use a block plane or sander along the back edge. Install the shelf. Slide the shelf over the cleat. If you want the shelf to be permanently mounted, glue together the top of the cleat and the inside bottom edge of the door blank. Nail the shelf to the cleat. Start at the middle, using a square as a guide, and work your way to each end. Use 1-inch brad nails spaced 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart. Nail the bottom as well. If you wish for the shelf to be removable (and didn't apply glue), use counter-sunk screws instead of brads. Install them from the top and use a small sticker to cover the heads.
