          "description":"These options are great because they add a crunch to your salad and they contain some vitamins and minerals, but they also won\u2019t overpower your plate with any one particular flavor. Always rinse off lettuce before you use it. Use a salad spinner to rinse and dry your lettuce, or simply run the leaves under water and gently pat them dry with a clean paper towel. You can buy pre-cut lettuce from the store, or you can buy whole bunches of lettuce. If you buy a bunch, rinse off the leaves and either tear them into bite-sized pieces by hand, or use a clean knife and cutting board to chop them up."

          "description":"If you\u2019re looking for a salad base that\u2019ll have more antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, look for greens that are darker in color. Kale, arugula, and spinach are all great options that will create a hardy base for the rest of your salad ingredients. Arugula has a peppery flavor. Raw kale can be tough to chew. Use baby kale for a softer option, or cut away and discard the stems from kale leaves to make them easier to eat."

Toss the slaw in a vinegar-based dressing, or simply leave it plain and add in the other salad ingredients. The most common cabbages are the cannonball cabbage and the red cabbage, but you can also use bok choy, napa cabbage, savoy cabbage, and January king cabbage.

This is a great option if you want to enjoy salads but don\u2019t love the texture or flavor of lettuce or cabbage.

If you can peel away the skin from the fruit, you don\u2019t need to worry about rinsing it. Be cautious of adding too many dried fruits to your salad, as they can be high in sugar."
