      "description":"If possible, set up your food storage so that Roman foods and non-Roman foods are stored on different shelves to make it easier for you. Stock up on the following important Roman staples:\nOlives and olive oil. Pliny the Elder sang the virtues of the olive by claiming that: \"Except the vine, there is no plant which bears a fruit of as great importance as the olive\". Buy \"pure\" olive oil for cooking and \"extra virgin\" for flavoring uncooked things;\n\nHoney. Use this instead of sugar. Or, you can also use dates to sweeten dishes;\nChickpeas (also known as \"garbanzo beans\") and lentils;\nWhole grains and whole grain flour such as \"emmer\", \"spelt\" or \"far\" (kinds of wheat) and barley. Emmer and spelt are available in \"health food\" stores. Emmer is a very ancient variety of wheat and is the most authentic choice for early Roman cooking. Rye was also consumed by the Romans;\nSalt;\nVegetables such as radishes, parsnips, carrots,  cabbage, leek, endive, celery, globe artichokes, cucumber, gourds, lettuce, onions. pennycress, nettles, asparagus and beets;\nFruit such as grapes, raisins, currants, sultanas, figs, dates, medlar, mulberry, damson, plums, cultivated cherry, apples, pears, crab apple, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and elder berries;\nMany herbs and spices such as oregano, dill, mustard, lovage, rosemary, rue, sage, sweet marjoram, thyme, aniseed, borage, black pepper, poppy seeds, fennel, mint, flat parsley, garlic, and savory;\nNuts include walnut, almond, chestnuts, and stone pine;\nMeat in the form of chicken, mutton, or pork (and ham, bacon, sucking pigs) was far more common than beef, although beef was supplied as rations to Roman garrisons in Britain and was much enjoyed in Roman Britain; wildfowl was common, such as duck and goose, and wealthy Romans also ate other birds we're less likely to eat nowadays, such as swan, stork, flamingo, and crane; rabbit, hare, and deer would also have been consumed by Romans;\nFungi (edible mushrooms);\nSnails and frogs (the French weren't there first! );\nSeafood including many types of fish (eel, perch, pike, carp, etc. ), crustaceans, and shellfish was very popular;\nSeveral sauces, including garum (a fish sauce similar to that used in Thai and Vietnamese cooking) or fermented fish sauce (liquamen); oenogarum was fish sauce mixed with wine. See \"Tips\" to learn how the Romans made fish sauce. Try a modern fermented fish condiment, such as mild Worcestershire sauce or chopped stronger, saltier anchovies. Cheese both hard and soft was made by Romans. Ricotta and feta are two very suitable types;\nWine (cooking and drinking) and vinegar. Vinegar added a sharp taste to sauces, preserved fruits, vegetables, and fish. The Romans also brewed beer."

      "description":"By the time of the Romans, cooking equipment had become far more complex than previous cooking cultures. Cooking was done over a raised brick hearth with a charcoal fire. While some foods such as meat or fish could be grilled direct on the charcoals, other food had to be cooked in tripod pots over the coals. In addition, it is likely that the Romans used steaming methods. Baking and roasting was also done in an oven using wood or charcoal as fuel. Naturally, your modern day oven and stove will be perfect substitutes. As for your cooking equipment, the extent of the authenticity is up to you but here are some common Roman items and possible substitutes:\nUse a good, large mortar and pestle (mortaria). This is your Roman style food processor. A marble one is best because it will not pick up flavors from such common ingredients as garlic. Naturally, if you're feeling lazy, the Romans would probably have snapped up food processors in the blink of an eye, so don't hesitate! Use a pizza stone for baking. Use a large pot for stews. The Romans used iron cauldrons but there's a good reason we don't tend to anymore \u2013 they're heavy! A large casserole can also be used as a Roman oven. Use a frying pan (fretale or sartago) for cooking fish and frying vegetables. A patella was used as a slightly deeper frying pan that could also be taken to the table, and the patina was an even deeper pan for more complex dishes. Perhaps use such items as paella pans and casserole dishes without lids for substitutes. Use jugs and pitchers (amphorae) for storing and pouring your olive oil, wine, and other liquids. Naturally, a measuring jug is also perfectly acceptable as a modern-day substitute. Roman knives, strainers, pots, and pans were generally similar to our modern day ones, so it's likely your kitchen is already well-equipped for Roman cooking."

If you're really keen, look for your own flour mill to grind the flour fresh at home. Although extra work, the freshness can make it worth your while. Bread was common but there are different types: autopyron was a slave and dog bread made from mostly bran with a little flour; athletae was unleavened bread mixed with soft curd cheese; buccellatum was the troop's staple dry biscuit; and artophites was light leavened bread made from the best flour baked in a mold."

Spoons were used for sauces and soft food, with a small spoon known as a cocleare used for removing shellfish from shells. It is also likely that larger spoons served as ladles. Solid foods were eaten using the fingers. Romans had bowls, plates, cups, finger bowls, jugs, goblets, and wine ladles.
