How much you buy will depend on which appliances you plan on covering. Stainless steel contact paper is plastic-based, so it cannot withstand heat.

Having someone help you will not only make your work go by quicker, but also make it easier. You will also get a nicer finish with fewer wrinkles and air bubbles.
