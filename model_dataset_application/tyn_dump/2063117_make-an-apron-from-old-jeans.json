Cut the legs off in a straight line just below the inseam. Cut the back with the pockets apart from the front along the side seams. You can set aside 1 of the legs for another project. Use a seam ripper to open the side seam on the leg. Cut off the hem at the ankle portion of the leg. This will be the top, or bib, of the apron. Keep the leg folded in half. Cut out a slight inward curve at the top to make a narrower bib. Cut a slight outward curve at the bottom so that the apron is lower in front and tapered at the sides.
