Examples of ponds that you can build include a miniature koi pond, a frozen winter themed pond, or even a science-fiction toxic sludge pond. Once you settle on an idea, you can create a pond that reflects what you want to create. Consider different pond themes depending on the season or holiday. For example, during the autumn you can create a Halloween inspired miniature pond with mini pumpkins, ghouls, and ghosts. During the winter you can create a festive holiday pond with snow."

Remember to add the features for the ground around the actual pond, as well as the pond itself. Once you settle on a design that you like, you can begin to build your project. Draw the overall shape of the pond before you start moving into finer details like rocks, plants, and other features that will surround the pond. Your pond can have ragged or smooth edges. If you want to keep it simple, draw an oval pond with no fine details."

After you've designed the pond on a separate piece of paper, it's time that you transfer the image to your styrofoam. Use a marker to copy the design that you've created directly onto the face of the styrofoam. Draw the outer edges of your project before moving towards the center and drawing finer details. A great miniature pond size is a 1x1 feet (30.48x30.48 cm). Special details that you may want to add include bridges, foliage, fish, trees, pipes, waterfalls, and branches."

Once you lay down your plaster, allow the base to dry for a couple of hours or overnight. You can use a rough sandpaper to sand down rough areas before applying another coat of plaster."
