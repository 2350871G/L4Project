  "text":" Crispy Fried Calamari Cut 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of squid into \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick rings. Put the fresh or thawed squid on your cutting board and use a sharp knife to carefully cut across each squid to make \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick rings.

If you can't buy cleaned squid, cut the squid in 1/2 so the tentacles are separate from the body. Then, pull the head off and peel away the skin. Rinse the squid before cutting it. Put the rings in a bowl and pour in \u20442 cup (120 ml) of buttermilk. Stir the calamari until it's completely coated with the buttermilk. Buttermilk tenderizes seafood, so it prevents the calamari from becoming tough.To prepare the calamari in advance, mix the rings in buttermilk and set it aside at room temperature for up to 1 hour. Pour 8 cups (1.9 L) of vegetable oil into a deep pot and heat it to 360 \u00b0F (182 \u00b0C). Set a deep pot, such as a Dutch oven, on the stove and add the vegetable oil. Clip a deep-fry thermometer to the side and turn the burner to medium-high. Heat the oil until it reaches 360 \u00b0F (182 \u00b0C).If you're using a saucepan, choose a deep 4 US qt (3.8 L) pan. Combine the flour and pepper in a separate bowl. Put 2 cups (240 g) of all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground black pepper into a mixing bowl. Stir or whisk to distribute the pepper. Toss the rings in the dry mixture. Use a slotted spoon to lift the calamari rings out of the buttermilk. Let the excess buttermilk drip back into the bowl. Put the rings into the bowl with the flour mixture and toss them until they're coated. Fry 1 batch of the rings for 1 minute. Lift the coated rings out of the flour and shake off excess flour before you lower them into the hot oil. Slowly put 1/4 of the rings into the oil and stir them with a wire mesh strainer. Fry them for 1 minute or until they're browned and crispy. Be careful when working with hot oil. Don't drop the rings into the oil or it could splash up and burn you. Transfer the fried calamari to a wire rack and fry another batch. Use the mesh strainer to scoop the fried calamari onto a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Once the oil temperature reaches 360 \u00b0F (182 \u00b0C), add another batch of rings and fry them.Tip: Heat your oven to 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C) and put the fried calamari in it to keep it warm while you fry the remaining batches. Although you could put the fried calamari on a paper towel-lined plate, the paper towel traps steam which will make the calamari soggy.

Keep the lid off of the saucepan and stir the calamari occasionally until it's soft when you poke it with a fork.If the tomato sauce boils, adjust the burner. Remove the sprigs of thyme and add harissa and lemon zest. Turn off the burner and use tongs to take the thyme sprigs out of the saucepan. Discard them and stir 1/2 tablespoon (8 g) of harissa paste or hot sauce along with 2 teaspoons (10 g) of lemon zest into the pan.Feel free to add more harissa or hot sauce if you like even spicier food.
