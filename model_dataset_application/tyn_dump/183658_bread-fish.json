If you're using crackers or need to make your own bread-crumbs, take some time to crunch them up as thoroughly as possible. The smaller the crumb, the better the crust will be eventually. Beat 1-2 eggs into a bowl with a small amount of milk or water to smoothen out the mixture. For a basic breaded fish, prepare the following ingredients:\nFish fillets of your choice.

It's usually helpful to have them in the order they'll be used. To one side of your skillet, line up the flour, then the egg, then the coating, which should be closest to the skillet. Take a minute to season your coating, if it isn't seasoned already. A pinch or two of salt and pepper are good additions, as well as cayenne pepper, seasoned salt, dill, or Old Bay seasoning.

          "description":"To fry your breaded fish, heat a half-inch or so of cooking oil on medium-high heat and fry the fish in it, turning once, about 3-5 minutes on each side. Turn the fish over when the crust has turned a golden brown color. It won't take long, so watch carefully. Wait until the oil is hot enough (about 350 degrees) before adding the fish. It should feel hot with your hand 3\u20135 inches (7.6\u201312.7 cm) above it, and spit when you throw a drop of water into it. Avoid over-loading the frying pan with too many pieces of fish, or you'll drop the temperature considerably. Frying at a lower temperature results in oily and soggy fish. Alternatively, you can bake the fish. To bake your breaded fish, place your breaded fillets into a baking dish or onto a baking sheet. Bake at 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway through."
