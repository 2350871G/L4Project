      "headline":"Convert this base tessellation into a more interesting shape.",
      "description":"By following these steps, you ensure that your shape will always be able to tile the plane. If you find it easier to work from a rectangular base, but want your tessellation to have slide symmetry, cut off one of the triangular flaps and append it to the opposite side. In the computer-generated image shown, the angle of the parallelogram was needed to determine the extent of the glide; if doing this by hand, you could start from this tessellation directly. Cut one side of the square and tape it to the opposite side. Do not flip it over or make any other movements other than sliding the paper to the opposite side. Use the ruler markings to ensure the cut portion is attached to the corresponding part of the opposite edge. In the image, a triangular region was moved to the opposite side. Repeat this cutting and pasting as desired. Moving one more triangular region creates the tessellation shown in the next step."
