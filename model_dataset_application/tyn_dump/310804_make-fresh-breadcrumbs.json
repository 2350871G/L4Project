To make fresh breadcrumbs with a grater:\nCut a large slice of unsliced bread that is comfortable to hold by hand, or pick out a slice of bread from a sliced loaf and cut off the crusts. Hold the sliced end against the grater. Choose a side with wider teeth holes. Grate the bread. The bread will begin to crumble against the teeth and fall down in uneven pieces.
