So, if you drive your car on muddy roads or drop silverware in the dirt on a camping trip, wash the items as soon as you can. If mud has dried on the item, use dish soap and a kitchen scouring pad to get it off, then rinse it thoroughly."

          "description":"When exposed to water and oxygen, iron will rust and degrade. For that reason, keep some towels or microfiber cloths on hand so you can dry any iron item as soon as it gets wet. Wiping off the water prevents rust and will keep your iron in good condition. For example, if you ride your bicycle in the rain, dry off the frame once you return home. Be sure to dry off any tools (e.g., a saw, hammer, or screwdriver) and metal furniture that get wet to prevent them from rusting."

To prevent this, set up a dehumidifier in the room to pull moisture from the air. This will dry out the air and prevent rust on items like bikes, tools, cars, and metal furniture. Purchase a dehumidifier at a local hardware store or home-improvement store. Remember to drain the dehumidifier when it fills up with water!"

You can soak the rusted iron in an acidic solution, like vinegar or cola, grind away the rust using power tools, or sand or scour it off by hand. If the rust patch is small and the metal hasn\u2019t begun to flake, scour it off using fine steel wool rated 000 or 0000."

Apply a generous, even coating to the surface of the metal. Purchase a rust-preventing spray from any hardware store or home-improvement store.

Dip a clean cloth or paper towel in cooking oil and thoroughly coat the inside and outside of the item in a thin layer of oil. Avoid coating the handle as this could make it slippery and cause you to drop the skillet. Alternatively, use grease to coat iron items on vehicles and bicycles, like bearings, nuts, bolts, and chains, to prevent rust. Be sure to reapply the oil or grease once it wears off."

Resin takes quite a while to dry, so don\u2019t move or use the iron object for 72 hours after you\u2019ve applied the resin.
