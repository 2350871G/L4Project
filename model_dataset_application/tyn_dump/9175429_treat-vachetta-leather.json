          "description":"Vachetta leather is very light to start, but as it\u2019s exposed to wear and tear, it typically darkens, developing a darker tan color known as a patina. The leather stains more easily when it\u2019s light, so you may want to help the patina along by placing the leather in the sun for an hour or so each day to develop a tan color that won't show stains as easily. It can take two to three weeks of regular sunning for the vachetta leather to develop an even patina."

          "description":"If you like the light color of new vachetta and don\u2019t want to encourage it to develop a patina, you can treat it with a water and stain repellant spray for leather products that will prevent stains from setting in. Avoid repellent products that must be painted or brushed on, though, because they may darken the vachetta. You can purchase water and stain repellent spray for leather at most stores that sell leather products, such as department stores and mass merchandise stores. It's also available from online retailers."

Hold the bottle the recommended distance from leather and mist it lightly and evenly. Let the leather dry for a day before using the item. Always do a spot test before using the spray on leather. Mist a small amount of the repellent on an inconspicuous area of the vachetta and wait a day to see how it reacts. If the leather doesn\u2019t darken, you can apply it all over."
