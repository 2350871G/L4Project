Instead, wait until the flower falls off on its own, which will reveal the rosehip. Then, pull off the rosehips and place them in a clean bowl. Rose hips are ready when they're red or orange in color. Don't use a rosehip that looks decayed or that's been damaged by birds or insects. While you can harvest rosehips as soon as they form on your rose bush, they'll taste the best if you harvest them after the first frost. That's because the cold will increase the sweetness of the rosehips. If you don't own a rosebush, ask to harvest rosehips from someone you know who has a rose bush. Alternatively, look for rose bushes in the wild. It's best to use rosehips that you know weren't treated with pesticides.Variation: You may be able to find fresh rosehips at your local Farmers Market or health food store."
