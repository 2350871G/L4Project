  "text":" Washing and Cutting Broccoli Rinse and dry your broccoli. Rinse a head of broccoli under cool water to remove any dirt or grit. Gently shake off the excess water. Dab the broccoli dry with a paper towel. Cut the broccoli head in half to separate the florets from the stem. Place the broccoli on a clean cutting board. Locate the part of the plant where the broccoli florets (i.e., the buds on the top) meet the stem. Cut the broccoli in half about an inch (approximately 2.5 cm) under this meeting point to separate florets from the stem. Cut the florets into bite-sized pieces. Cut the stem that remains under the head of the broccoli vertically. Continue to cut it into smaller pieces until you are left with bite-sized florets. Try to make pieces that are similarly sized so that they cook evenly. Peel and cut the stem. Using a paring knife, carefully remove any dark green leaves from the broccoli stalk. Use a vegetable peeler to strip away the outer layer of the stem, which is thick and difficult to eat. Use a sharp knife to cut the remaining stem into bite-sized pieces. Cut pieces of broccoli stems to be about the same size as the florets. Steaming Fresh Broccoli Set a steamer basket on a medium-sized pot of water. Pour an inch (approximately 2.5 cm) of water into a medium-sized pot. Attach a steamer basket to the top of the pot. Make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of the basket. Simmer the water. Set one of your stove top burners to a medium-high heat. Place your pot on the burner, uncovered. Allow the water to reach a simmer. Add broccoli to the steamer basket. Place your broccoli florets and stems in the steamer basket. Do not fill the basket more than the height of the pot. Cover the pot with a lid. Steam the broccoli for about five minutes. Allow your broccoli to steam in the pot for about five minutes, until you can pierce it with a fork. At that time, remove the pot from the burner and carefully lift off the lid. Spear a piece of broccoli with a fork to see if it is tender. The fork should pierce through the broccoli with very little effort. If it does not, the broccoli is not finished cooking. Continue steaming the broccoli if needed. If your broccoli isn\u2019t cooked through after five minutes, continue steaming it for one minute intervals. After a minute, test a piece of broccoli by piercing it with a fork. If it is still not cooked, continue steaming it and check it again after one minute. Checking the broccoli this frequently will prevent overcooking, which will leave it soft and mushy. Microwaving Broccoli Place the broccoli in a heat-safe dish and cover with water. Place your cut broccoli florets and stems in a microwave safe dish. For each medium-sized head of broccoli that you use, add approximately 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) (1.5 oz.) of water to the dish. The broccoli pieces do not need to be fully submerged. The steam created from the water will cook them. Cover the dish partially. Loosely cover the dish with a microwave safe lid or dinner plate. Leave an opening for some steam to escape while the broccoli cooks. Alternatively, use a vented, microwave-safe lid that allows steam to be released from the top. Heat on high for 3-4 minutes. Place the dish in the microwave. Program the heat setting to high and cook the broccoli for 3-4 minutes. Note that cooking times may vary for different microwaves. Remove the broccoli to see if it is cooked. Remove the broccoli from the microwave and carefully remove the lid. Pierce the broccoli with a fork to see if it is ready. If it requires more cooking, place the broccoli back in the microwave for one minute intervals until it is ready. Saut\u00e9ing Broccoli Oil and heat a medium-sized pan. Pour one tablespoon (0.5 oz.) of olive oil into a medium-sized pan. Lightly tilt the pan in circular motions to spread the oil across the surface. Place the pan on the stove top over medium heat for one minute to heat it. Broccoli can also be cooked with an equal amount of another type of oil (e.g., coconut oil) or butter.

Cook and stir the broccoli for 6-7 minutes. Set a timer or alarm to count 6-7 minutes of cooking time. Cook the broccoli over a medium heat. Stir the pieces frequently with your spatula. Move broccoli pieces from the outside part of the pan towards the middle as you stir, and flip them as much as possible. Remove your broccoli from the heat and transfer it to a plate. Once the broccoli is done cooking, remove the pan from the heat and turn off the stove. Carefully transfer your broccoli to a plate using your spatula. Allow it to cool. Sprinkle the broccoli with salt and pepper as desired to flavor it. Roasting Broccoli Pre-heat the oven and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Prepare to roast broccoli by pre-heating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 220 degrees Celsius). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. The foil can be disposed of after cooking, making cleanup much simpler. Toss together broccoli pieces, cooking oil, and salt. In a medium-sized bowl, mix the florets and stems from one head of broccoli with 2\u20133 tablespoon (29.6\u201344.4 ml) (1-1.5 oz.) of cooking oil. Use a spatula to stir the pieces until they are all covered in oil. Add a dash of salt to taste. Spread the broccoli pieces out evenly on the pan. Transfer the broccoli pieces to the pan.
