If the underlayment is plywood, use a reciprocating saw and 12 inch (30.5 cm) wood cutting blade to cut through the plywood. Cut the plywood underlayment out and remove it along with the tile. If the underlayment is cement backer board, use a reciprocating saw with a carbide-grit masonry-cutting blade and remove the backer board with the tile still attached. Be careful to avoid cutting through the subfloor or you will have to reinstall a new subfloor before you place new flooring down."
