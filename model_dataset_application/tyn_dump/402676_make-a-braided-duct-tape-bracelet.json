Bring it over the new middle strand. Again, make sure that it does not twist. This is now the newest middle strand. Repeat these steps until it's loose enough to wrap around your wrist. Continue to cross the left and right strands over the middle strand. Don't let the strands get twisted or wrinkled. Stop once the braid is loose enough to wrap around your wrist.
