Try to avoid using strawberries that have a lot of purple or green color in them, since you're aiming for a specific red, white, and blue color scheme. Leave the strawberries whole, including their green tops, so that you have something to hold onto when you're dipping and eating them."

Move them around a bit to ensure all sides of the berries are rinsed off. If your strawberries are really dirty, fill a bowl with cool water, submerge them, and swish them back and forth. Then, rinse each one under the tap.Tip: Don\u2019t leave the strawberries in a wet colander or bowl after rinsing them. They will absorb water and become mushy."

Avoid rubbing or applying pressure as you dry them off, since they can be easily damaged. It's important to make sure the strawberries are totally dry before proceeding!
