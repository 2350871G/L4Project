          "description":"Get out a 9-inch (23-cm) square baking pan. Dip a pastry brush in some vegetable oil and spread it along the bottom and sides of the pan. Place 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar into a small, fine mesh sieve. Dust enough of the powdered sugar to completely coat the pan. Tap out the powdered sugar that doesn't stick to the oil. You won't need to use all of the powdered sugar. Just set the sieve aside since you'll need to dust more powdered sugar later. You could also spray the pan with cooking spray instead of spreading it with vegetable oil."

          "description":"Wash 4 medium lemons (about 1 pound or 453 g). Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the zest in large strips. Avoid peeling so deeply that you also get the white pith. If you do, just use a small knife to trim away the pith. Set the lemons aside and roughly chop the strips of lemon zest."

Stir the mixture a little so all of the powder is touching the liquid. Set the lemon-gelatin mixture aside to soften. You'll probably need four envelopes (1/4-ounce each) of unflavored gelatin."

Don't worry if the syrup foams up as it reaches temperature. You may just need to turn the temperature on the stove down a little."

Slowly pour the hot syrup into the side of the bowl so it gradually mixes into the gelatin. Turn the speed up to high, add 1/4 teaspoon (about 30 drops) of yellow food coloring, and beat the mixture for about 5 minutes so it becomes marshmallow. The marshmallow will become thick and fluffy once it's finished beating. If you turn off the mixer and lift a beater up, the marshmallow should make a thick ribbon when it falls back into the bowl. If you want a brighter yellow color, you can add more yellow food coloring."
