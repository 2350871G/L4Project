Raymond Chiu\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Director of Operations, Maid Sailors\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: A warm and less windy day is better for cleaning the outside of your house. Prepare a bucket of water and dishwashing liquid. Heavier cleaners can damage the vegetation around your home, and water is typically enough to clean the surfaces.
