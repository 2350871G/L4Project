Let the saw do most of the work and keep the blade straight as you make your cut so you don\u2019t bend or break the blade. Once you reach the end of your cut, let go of the trigger before pulling the saw out. Try changing the angle of your blade as you cut through the material to help reduce the surface area and make the cut faster.

Pull the trigger and tilt the saw up so the blade goes into the material at a 30- or 45-degree angle. Continue tilting the saw until it\u2019s perpendicular to the material and the blade has gone completely through to the other side. Plunge cuts work perfectly for cutting holes in walls or the middle of large panels.
