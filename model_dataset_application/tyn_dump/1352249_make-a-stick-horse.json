  "text":" Steps Select and gather decorative materials for the riding toy. You can use ribbons, yarn, googly eyes, large buttons and other materials to add creative touches to your hobbyhorse. Purchase a dowel that is approximately 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter and 3 feet (1 m) in length. You will use this dowel for the body of the stick horse. Cut a groove in the dowel 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) above the spot where the hands will grasp the horse's body. This groove will help you to attach the head of the hobbyhorse to the dowel. Cut out ears from a stiff, heavy fabric.  Sew the ears onto the heel of the sock, which will be the top of the head.  Use a permanent fabric marker to draw eyes and nostrils onto the bottom of the sock.  Make a Head With Fabric Make a pattern for the head. You can create a pattern for the head of the riding toy by drawing the shape of the head freehand on cardboard or poster board. Optionally, enlarge, photocopy and print an illustration you want to use for a pattern. Include a long neck on the stick horse pattern. Cut out the pattern along the outlines.  Fold the fabric in half.  Place your pattern on the fabric and cut around it. You will now have 2 identical pieces. Sew the 2 pieces together to make a head for the stick horse. Leave the bottom of the neck open to insert the dowel. Finish the Stick Horse Stuff your hobbyhorse's head about half full with cotton batting. You can cut up old socks or fabric if you don't have batting. Decorate the face to make eyes, nostrils and a mouth.  Glue or sew on curtain fringe or yarn to make the stick horse's mane.  Fit the dowel into the hobbyhorse's head all the way to the top of the head (or the heel of the sock).  Finish stuffing the head while holding the dowel inside.  Tie the head tightly to the dowel using yarn, string or hair elastics over the fabric. The fastener should sit in the groove you cut into the dowel. Add finishing touches to your riding toy, such as reins made of ribbon, if desired. ",
