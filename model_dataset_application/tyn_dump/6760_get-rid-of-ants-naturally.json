When ants walk in or over boric acid, they ingest it and die. Boric acid is poisonous and should not be ingested or come in contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Handle it with gloves. A sample boric acid bait could be made with boric acid and maple syrup. Drizzle a spoonful of syrup on a plate or saucer. Sprinkle this liberally with boric acid. Use a skewer, toothpick, or cotton swab to distribute the acid evenly through the syrup. Place your boric acid bait wherever the ants are frequenting. Keep it out of the reach of children or pets.

    "A particularly effective one is made with boric acid.",
    "Boric acid and sodium borate salts are naturally found in minerals like sassolite.",
    "When ants walk in or over boric acid, they ingest it and die.",
    "Boric acid is poisonous and should not be ingested or come in contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.",
    "Handle it with gloves.",
    "A sample boric acid bait could be made with boric acid and maple syrup.",
    "Drizzle a spoonful of syrup on a plate or saucer.",
    "Sprinkle this liberally with boric acid.",
    "Use a skewer, toothpick, or cotton swab to distribute the acid evenly through the syrup.",
    "Place your boric acid bait wherever the ants are frequenting.",
    "Keep it out of the reach of children or pets.",
    "This method can take a week to take effect.",
    "Use food against ants.",
    "There are many foods ants are unable to digest.",
    "These methods are effective, though you might have to clean up dead ants after the fact.",
    "Spread the following bait foods where the ants are appearing:\n\nCorn meal.",
    "This method is especially great around pets or children, as cornmeal itself is not poisonous.",
    "Cream of wheat (farina).",
    "Spread this raw where there are ants.",
    "It will expand in their stomachs, killing them.",
    "Coffee grounds.",
    "Ants are sensitive to caffeine.",
    "Leave used coffee grounds where the ants will carry it home and eat it.",
    "This method takes a few weeks for results.",
    "Deal with carpenter ants as naturally as possible.",
    "An invasion of carpenter ants is serious.",
    "They can compromise or damage your house structure.",
    "Piles of broken wings and ants with longer than average bodies are indications of carpenters.",
    "You may also see fecal pellets (which look like sawdust) and they can sometimes be heard rustling in the walls.",
    "Some ways to deal with them include:\nBaiting them.",
    "They like sugar, so you can turn this against them.",
    "Use the boric acid method described previously.",
    "Vacuuming their nests out of infested walls, if possible.",
    "Calling an exterminator.",
    "Professionals can drill holes in the wall and blow in diatomaceous earth, silica aerogel, or boric acid inside to eliminate the infestation.",
    "Pyrethrin spray can also be used.",
    "Using a Professional Exterminator Verify the exterminator uses natural pesticides.",
    "Some exterminators specialize in using natural pest control methods.",
    "Search for one near you by doing an online keyword search for \"organic insect and pest control\" or \"natural insect and pest extermination.\"",
    "This kind of pest control is often poorly regulated.",
    "Some pest services are only \"organic\" or \"natural\" in name, but not in fact.",
    "Call exterminators and inquire directly about services, saying something like, \"Could you tell me how your methods are all natural?\"",
    "Call a professional to deal with fire ants.",
    "Fire ants rarely enter the home, but if they do, get help immediately.",
    "They're aggressive, and their stings are painful and can sometimes trigger an allergic reaction.",
    "If the ants must be sprayed, insist on the use of a bait that has an insect growth regulator, like abamectin, in it.",
    "Follow all advice given by exterminators.",
    "Exterminators are professionals who have been trained not only in pest removal but also prevention.",
    "If you've had difficulty with any of the techniques mentioned here, ask the exterminator for their advice.",
    "For example, you may have looked high and low but were unable to find the ants' entrance into your home.",
    "An exterminator could help pinpoint this for you.",
    "Attack the nest directly on your own.",
    "Although you're not a professional, using this professional technique can have professional results.",
    "Sneak up on an ant nest on a cool day.",
    "Then pour several gallons/liters of boiling water into the nest entrance.",
    "If you want to make the water more deadly, add vinegar, insecticidal soaps, citrus oil, pyrethrum insecticide, or ammonia.",
    "Repeat this process every day or so until it seems that the ants have given up and moved.",
    "This may take several days to take effect."
