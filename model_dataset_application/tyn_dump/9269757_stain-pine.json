          "description":"Start with a coarse square (around 100-grit) and go over the pine using a wide, looping circular motion. This first pass is to wear down the small contours, ridges, and knotholes characteristic of softwoods and leave you with a more even surface to work with. A sanding block will allow you to apply more consistent pressure than a handheld sheet of sandpaper. Sanding helps open up the pores in natural wood surfaces, which will allow the stain to set in better."

          "description":"After taking off the rough outer layer, switch to a finer grain (150 to 200-grit) and sand the pine a second time. An additional sanding will ensure that the wood is properly blended and prepared for staining. If you\u2019re working with raw pine boards, don\u2019t forget to go over the cut ends, as well."

Run the damp sponge over the outer surface of the pine from end to end with heavy, sweeping strokes in one direction. This will not only restore the grain, but also pick up loose dust and debris. Wood grain becomes compressed after sanding. A little bit of moisture cause the surface fibers to swell, returning them to their natural position."

Following the second coat, you should be able to notice the sealant just beginning to pool on the grain. If you\u2019re staining a larger piece, touch up the sections you conditioned first periodically to keep them wet as you work. Pre-sealing your pine essentially evens out the empty space inside the grain, allowing the stain to stand out boldly on top without simply absorbing too deep into the wood."
