          "description":"Working with concrete can get messy, so be sure you wear old clothing and waterproof gloves. Also, put down a heavy-duty tarp in case of any spills. However, it's even more important to protect yourself from breathing in concrete dust, so work in a ventilated area and wear a dust mask. You can typically buy a dust mask wherever you buy your concrete supplies. If you're mixing up a large batch of concrete, it's best to work on the ground, rather than trying to lift up the heavy container from a table or workbench."

          "headline":"Mix up a 20 lb (9.1 kg) bag of concrete.",
          "description":"Pour your concrete mix into a large plastic container, such as a 5 US gal (19 l) bucket. Then, use a sturdy, long-handled spoon to slowly stir in about 3\u20134 cups (0.71\u20130.95 L) of water, according to the packaging instructions. The exact amount of water you use can vary depending on the brand of cement and even the humidity in your area. However, the cement should resemble thick brownie batter when it's properly mixed. A 20 lb (9.1 kg) of cement mix should make about 3-5 10\u201312 in (25\u201330 cm) pumpkins. Variation: To make a lighter cement mixture, called hypertufa, replace half of your concrete mix with equal parts perlite and peat moss. It will still be sturdy and long-lasting, but your pumpkins won't weigh as much."

As you work, squeeze the concrete mixture all the way down the leg into the foot portion of the pantyhose. Aim to use about a softball-sized batch of concrete for your pumpkin. Want to make a hollow pumpkin? Put an inflated balloon into the pantyhose before you add the concrete. Then, scoop the concrete into the pantyhose, squishing it around the balloon to ensure the balloon is completely coated. Allow the concrete to dry as normal."

Then, use scissors to snip off the extra pantyhose about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) above the knot. Try to keep the concrete formed in a round shape as you do this, and be sure you're wearing your gloves."

        {
          "headline":"Wrap rubber bands or string around the pantyhose to segment it.",
          "description":"To mimic the natural segments on a pumpkin, tightly wrap a long piece of string or several rubber bands around the pantyhose. Try to space out the string or elastic as you wrap, creating about 6-8 segments. Make sure you can see the string or rubber bands cutting into the concrete when you're finished. Otherwise, you might not be able to see the segments when the pumpkin is dry. If you're using rubber bands, wrap each one once or twice around the pumpkin so it digs into the concrete. Criss-cross 3 or 4 rubber bands so the pumpkin is divided into either 6 or 8 sections, similar to a peeled orange. If you're using string, wrap it all the way around the concrete ball once or twice, then move the string over about 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) and wrap it around the ball again. Keep doing this until you have 6-8 segments. Knot it securely when you're finished so it doesn't unravel. If you're making more than one pumpkin, continue the process until you've used all the cement mix."

          "headline":"Let the concrete dry for 1-2 days.",
          "description":"Set your pumpkin in a dry place where it won't be disturbed, like a sunny porch or a workbench. Give the pumpkin at least 1 full day to dry, although 2 days is better, if possible. When you're making cement pumpkins using pantyhose, it's important to let the pumpkin dry completely. If it's still wet, it will crumble when you unwrap it. You may need 3-4 days if you're making larger pumpkins."
        },

Then, slice the pantyhose and pull the material away from the hardened concrete. Work very carefully as you do this so you don't cut yourself! Tip: Glue a pumpkin stem on top or paint your pumpkin to personalize it!"
