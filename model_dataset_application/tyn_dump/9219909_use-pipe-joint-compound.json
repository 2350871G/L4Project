Use this applicator to smear the liquid sealant liberally onto the threads of the male pipe fitting. Make sure the pipes you're sealing are clean and dry prior to applying pipe dope.

This will help fill in the threads and promote a stronger, longer-lasting seal. Reapply the sealant as needed to achieve full coverage. By the time you're finished, you should barely be able to see the threads at all. Be sure to only spread the sealant onto the threaded section of the male pipe segment, not on the female threads or any other part of the pipe. If you're fitting pipes together for a high-pressure application, you can use wicking to ensure water-tightness. Wrap string around the threads after applying the joint compound."

One additional benefit of using pipe joint sealant over other types of sealants is that it also serves as lubrication, allowing you to insert the male segment much deeper into the female segment or fitting.

For larger pipes, however, or systems that will be subjected to high temperatures or continual vibrations, the sealant may require as long as 48 hours to set. Humid conditions may increase the initial set time by as much as 50%. Once the sealant has set, it will continue to cure for several days, or up to 2 weeks, for pipes 12\u201315 inches (30\u201338 cm) or larger. Many pipe joint sealants never fully harden\u2014they'll remain slightly gummy in order to expand and contract within the pipe. Hold off on restoring water or gas flow to the pipes until the sealant has had ample time to form a secure seal."
