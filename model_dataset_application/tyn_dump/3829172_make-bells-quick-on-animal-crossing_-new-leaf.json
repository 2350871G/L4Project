Catching rare bugs and fish can get you thousands easily. Seashells can be found on your beach or on the island. Sand dollars are worth 60 bells each. Sea snail shells are worth 90 bells each. Venus combs are worth 150 bells each. Corals are worth 250 bells each. Conches are worth 350 bells each. Giants clams and oyster shells are both worth 450 bells each. Scallop shells are worth 600 bells each. Pearl oysters are worth 1,200 bells each. You can find fruit on trees. You can plant your fruit to grow more trees. Coconut and banana trees are grown on the beach all the others are grown on the grass. Your native fruit (the first fruit grown in your town, either apples, cherries, pears, peaches or oranges) is worth 100 bells each or 600 bells if it's perfect.

Memorize the rocks that your town started with, because the ore rock will be one that you haven't seen before. Hit the new rock with your shovel, and it will blast open. You will see an ore which can be sold within the price range of 2,000 bells to 4,000 bells. You need to keep hitting it in succession. If you pause, the money will stop. Some people dig holes around them and the rock to prevent recoil, as hitting the rock pushes you away a little. You can sell the ore at Re-Tail or you can put them up for sell on the flea market spaces at Re-Tail. 7,999 bells is the usually the highest price that you can sell them for where it is guaranteed that a villager will buy it. When a villager walks into Re-Tail just push them over in front of the ore and talk to them. They will ask if they should buy it, so just tell them yes. Gold nuggets are worth 4,000 bells each, silver nuggets are worth 3,000 bells and amethysts, emeralds, sapphires and rubies are worth 2,000 bells. Make sure there is space around the rock.
