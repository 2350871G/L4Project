    "Microwaving the Zucchini Noodles Start with partially damp noodles.",
    "For this method, you should let the zucchini noodles retain some of their natural moisture so that they will cook without drying out completely in the microwave.",
    "You can skip the sweating portion of the instructions altogether or simply skip the part in which you wring out extra moisture using the paper towels.",
    "That said, you may still want to let the zucchini noodles drain in a colander for 10 minutes or so before microwaving them.",
    "If you do happen to dry the zucchini noodles out beforehand, you can still use this cooking method.",
    "Simply add 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of water to the dish with the zucchini noodles to provide the noodles with just enough moisture to keep from drying out.",
    "Place the zucchini noodles in a microwave-safe dish.",
    "Arrange them in an even layer and cover loosely with a microwave-safe lid or piece of microwave-safe plastic wrap.",
    "The seal should not be especially tight.",
    "If you use a lid, open any vents in the lid or leave it partially cracked open to vent the dish as it cooks.",
    "If you use plastic wrap, drape the plastic wrap over the top instead of securing it on tightly.",
    "Microwave on high for 2 minutes.",
    "Cook the zucchini noodles until tender but not yet falling apart.",
    "Keep a close eye on the zucchini noodles as they cook.",
    "If you overcook them, they could become soggy, hard, or otherwise gross.",
    "Serve.",
    "Drain the excess liquid and transfer the zucchini noodles to individual serving plates.",
    "There will almost always be excess liquid in the dish after you make zucchini noodles in the microwave.",
    "You can drain the liquid easily using a colander."
