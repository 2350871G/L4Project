Find the shutoff valve on the wall near the base of the toilet and turn it clockwise to stop the flow of water. Then, flush the toilet to drain the tank. Prior to draining the toilet tank, test for possible leaks by squeezing a few drops of food coloring into the tank and checking back the following morning. If the water in the bowl has changed colors, it means you\u2019ve got a leak. Rotate the shutoff valve until it stops turning to ensure that the water is completely off."

The fill valve is a narrow vertical tube that refills the tank, while the flush valve is an opening at the bottom of the tank fitted with a rubber or plastic flapper on a chain that releases water when the toilet is flushed. Pay particular attention to the condition of the ballcock arm (balloon-like rubber ball on the fill valve that gauges the water level), and the chain on the flush valve.
