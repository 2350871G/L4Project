Using your measuring tape and a pencil, mark out that distance to the right or left of the first screw. If you want the objects to sit at the same height, put a level on the line you measured out to ensure the screws are even with each other. If you want the objects to sit at different heights, measure up or down from the second mark. For instance, if you want the second object to sit 4 inches (10 cm) higher and 18 inches (46 cm) to the right of the first one, measure out 18 inches (46 cm) to the right of the first screw. Then measure 4 inches (10 cm) up from there and put the second screw in. Keep measuring, leveling, and installing screws until you have them all in position."
