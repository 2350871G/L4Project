  "text":" Reheating Plain Pasta Boil a pot of water. Pour in enough water to cover the noodles, but don't add them to the pot. Wait until the water comes to a boil. You may use the methods below instead, but this is the fastest and best option for pasta without sauce. Transfer the pasta to a metal strainer. Choose a metal strainer or colander that can fit into your pot. Ideally, find one with long handles for easy handling. Dip the pasta into the boiling water. It only takes about thirty seconds to refresh most pasta. Withdraw the strainer and taste test the noodles. If they are not ready, return them to the water. Withdraw and taste test again every 15 seconds. If your strainer does not have long handles, or if you do not have oven mitts, instead place the strainer in a bowl and pour boiling water over it. In the Oven Preheat the oven. Set your oven to 350\u00baF (175\u00baC) and wait for it to preheat. This method is gentle on pasta and sauces, but may not be practical for a single serving. Add the pasta to a baking dish. Spread the pasta across a shallow dish. A deep pile of pasta may heat unevenly. If the pasta is dry, add a splash of milk or extra sauce to keep it moist. This is especially important for lasagna. Cover with foil and bake. The pasta is usually ready in 20 minutes, but check after 15 just in case. The foil should help trap moisture, slowing the drying process. Optionally, add a sprinkle of Parmesan under the foil 5 minutes before the pasta is done. Check the pasta. Stick a metal fork into the center of the pasta dish and wait for 10 to 15 seconds. If the tip of the fork is hot to the touch, the pasta is ready. If not, return the pasta to the oven. On the Stovetop Fry most pasta dishes over medium-low heat. This is one of the easiest ways to heat pasta. Just add melted butter or oil to a frying pan, add the pasta, and heat. Stir occasionally. Add more sauce if the pasta looks dry. Heat cream or wine sauces over low heat. These easily separated sauces should be heated over very low heat. For lower risk of separation, see the cream sauce method below. Fry lasagna. Cut yourself a slab and toss it on the pan, cut side down. Rotate occasionally, heating each cut side until crispy.
