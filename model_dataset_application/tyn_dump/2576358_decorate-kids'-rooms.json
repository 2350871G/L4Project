This will help keep you from over spending, or over spending on an area that is less important. It's easy to lose track of money when decorating a room!"

          "description":"You should ask your child what they want their room to look like...they probably have a few ideas! But you'll want to keep in mind how the design can change over time. Remember, just because your little girl likes Princesses right now doesn't mean she won't grow out of it in a few years and decide she hates her room. Try to choose decorations that are easy to change, so that you don't have to spend a lot of money later. This is also true with teens. They have their own style, but think about what you're going to do with the room once they move out."

          "description":"You can of course just go with a few colors that look nice and standard decorations, but choosing a theme can make your life a lot easier.

It's easy to design a room that you'd like for yourself but remember that kids have very different needs than adults. Their personality will also play a big part in how they enjoy the room and what they'll need to get the most from their room. For example, a bench at the foot of the bed is useful for you to get ready in the morning, but your child wouldn't use one. For example, are they more bookish? If so It's probably more important to have a reading area with a comfy place to sit than a larger play area that they'll never use. But it depends on them!"

A good way to do this is to make some spaces do double duty.

For example, put the dresser and bed next to each other because those are the functional items of the room, and have another area that's for play and contains bookshelves and toys. You can even use furniture to divide a room into smaller sections. Make a secret bed cove by placing the bed against the back wall and then placing big book shelves across in front of it. Your child will love their secret hide out!"
