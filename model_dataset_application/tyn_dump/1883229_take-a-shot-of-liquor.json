          "description":"A chaser is a drink that you can use to decrease the taste of the shot. Get a soda, juice, or beer to take with your shot. You will take a sip of the chaser right after you down the shot to remove the taste of the liquor from your tongue. Make sure you have your chaser ready before you take your shot. You can also take a small sip of the chaser before you take your shot and hold it in your mouth. Drink the shot, and then swallow the chaser and the shot at the same time. Once you have swallowed, take another sip of the chaser. Depending on the shot (i.e. tequila) you are taking, you may need to get your lemon, lime, or salt ready before you take the shot. Beer is the most commonly used chaser. Tequila can be chased with a light lager such as Tecate, Corona, or Pacifico. Bourbon pairs well with an imperial stout beer. Chase with any beer that you like or ask the bartender for a suggestion. If you are drinking whiskey, try using pickle juice as a chaser."

          "description":"Slightly tilt your head as you raise the shot glass to your mouth. Continue tilting your head and the shot glass at the same time as you drink the liquor. The shot glass should be upside-down when you are finished taking the shot. This motion will make it easier for you to get the shot down your throat. Be careful not to tilt your head too far back. You do not want to choke on the liquor. Make sure you tilt both your head and the shot glass. Titling only one of these can result in a mess. For example, if you tilt the glass but do not tilt your head back, you may spill the shot on your clothes."

Once you have finished the shot, exhale out of your mouth again. Avoid breathing through your nose during the shot taking process. Breathing through your nose intensifies the taste of the shot. Remember to inhale before you take the shot. Inhaling while you take the shot will cause you to inhale fumes and cough."

You will also taste the liquor much more if you do not swallow it immediately. Prolonging the shot can also cause the liquor to go down the wrong pipe. Keep your jaw and your throat relaxed as you swallow."

If you are trying to avoid having a hangover the next day, choose a clear liquor like vodka, gin, or some tequilas. Higher quality spirits not only taste better, but they also decrease your risk of a hangover. Opt for premium liquor when possible. Dark liquors (e.g. rum, whiskey, bourbon) contain larger amounts of congeners. The increased amount of these congeners can make you have a more severe hangover. Dark liquors tend to have a stronger flavor compared to light liquors. If you do not have a preference, you may want to take a shot of a clear liquor."

A double shot at a bar is typically 2  fl oz (59 mL). If you are preparing the shot yourself, use measuring spoons: 3 tablespoons or 9 teaspoons is equivalent to a 1.5  fl oz (44 mL) shot. If you do not have measuring spoons, you can use a Solo brand cup. The bottom line of the Solo cup is 1  fl oz (30 mL). A small medicine cup that comes with a bottle of cough syrup can also be used.

If you notice that someone else has had too much to drink, figure out a way for the person to get home safely. Alcohol slows down your reaction time, changes your vision, and makes it more difficult for you to process information. This increases your chances of getting into a wreck when you are driving. If you plan to drive home, have a drink with your meal and do not consume more than 1 glass of wine, beer, mixed drink, or shot in an hour. Again, it is best not to drink if you plan to drive."

Try not to have more than 1 drink (i.e. 5  fl oz (150 mL) of wine, 12  fl oz (350 mL) of beer, 1 mixed drink, or 1.5  fl oz (44 mL) of hard liquor) per hour.
