          "description":"Use a pair of sharp pruning shears to snip the lower end of the stem at a slight angle. Only take healthy cuttings that do not have signs of disease of infestation. Cutting the stem at an angle increases its surface area, allowing it to take up more moisture and nutrients from the planting soil. Wear gardening gloves and eye protection when you take a cutting. Take semi-ripe or hardwood for your cuttings rather than younger sections that are still green. The best time to take cuttings from bougainvillea is late-spring to mid-summer, when growth is most rapid and abundant. Getting bougainvillea to root can be tricky. Consider taking multiple cuttings to give yourself more than one shot if your first attempt fails. You can cut back as much as a third of the plant's growth without worrying about harming it. Sterilize your gardening tools with rubbing alcohol before and after you take a cutting."

          "headline":"Prune the leaves from the stem.",
          "description":"The stem is the only part of the bougainvillea that will  take root successfully. Cut away all flowers, leaves, and small offshoots from the slender, woody shaft. Trim and discard any sections that are still green, as these are less likely to survive when planted. Make sure you remove at least half of the leaves from the stem. This will help ensure that all of the plant\u2019s resources are being used to form new roots. If you\u2019re not planning on rooting your bougainvillea right away, wrap your cuttings in a damp paper towel and store them in the refrigerator in an airtight plastic bag. This will keep them from drying out for 1-2 weeks."

          "headline":"Dip the cut end in rooting hormone.",
          "description":"Wet the bottom of the stem and press it into a container of powdered rooting hormone. Coat the underside thoroughly, but avoid caking or clumping. To remove excess powder, tap the stem lightly with your fingertip. Rooting hormone can be found at most major gardening centers, greenhouses, and plant nurseries. It\u2019s also sometimes known as \u201crooting acid.\u201d\nYou can also try making your own rooting hormone at home using ingredients like apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, honey, or crushed Aspirin."

When using a packaged soil, consider mixing in \u2153 perlite, vermiculite, or horticultural grit to promote proper drainage. You\u2019ll only be caring for your bougainvillea in this container until it takes root, so a pot as small as 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) will work just fine."

If you\u2019re working with a denser soil mixture and you\u2019re worried about damaging the stem, it may help to first open up a narrow hole using a pencil or similar object.
