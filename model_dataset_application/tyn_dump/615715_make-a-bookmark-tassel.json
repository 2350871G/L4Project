  "text":" Work around a wide ruler or a piece of stiff card (such as from a cereal box). Cut or fold it to an appropriate width, about 1.5 inches (4cm). You can adjust the length of the tassel by making this object wider or narrower. If in doubt, start with a card that's a little wider than you want. You can always trim the ends shorter later. Wrap the string, cord, or yarn around the ruler or card several times. The number of loops, along with the thickness of the string, determines the thickness of the tassel. Cut the end of the string off the loops and cut a second piece of a generous length, perhaps a yard (90cm) or more. Fold this second piece in half. Thread the folded end of the second string under the loops. There should be no need to use a needle. You should have a short loop on one side and two long tails on the other side. Pull the two long tails through the short loop.  Tighten this knot snugly by pulling on the two long ends. Then slide the tassel off the ruler or card. Thread both loose ends through a large needle.  Double the two loose ends, leaving about a four inch (10cm) loop.  Push the needle through the top of the tassel and out the side.  Wrap the free ends several times around the tassel, a little ways down from the first knot. Wrap tightly, and aim for even loops, forming a small, round ball. Push the needle down through the center of these loops from top to bottom.  Pull the two long tails all the way through and tighten the knot firmly.  Cut open the bottoms of the loops from before.  Trim the ends to an even length.  Insert the tassel in the bookmark by threading the loop end through the hole.  Pass the tassel through the looped ends, and tug gently.  Enjoy your new tassel. ",
