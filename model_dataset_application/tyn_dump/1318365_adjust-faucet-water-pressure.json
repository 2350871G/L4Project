Checking the Shut-Off Valves Locate the valves underneath your sink. The water valves control how much water goes through your pipes and can be found underneath your sink. You should have 2 valves made of plastic or metal attached to your faucet to control hot and cold water separately. Turn the valves counterclockwise to open them and increase water pressure. If you have low water pressure, make sure the valves are in the open position. Rotate each of the valves counterclockwise until the arrow is pointing in the direction of the pipes. This means the water valve is fully opened and you should get the maximum amount of pressure. Make sure both of the valves are all the way on so you can control the water temperature easier.

If you turn 1 of the valves, make sure to turn the other valve the same amount. Try turning the valves completely off and back on again to see if it fixes the problem on its own. Flushing the Supply Lines Turn off the hot water valve. Locate the valve underneath your sink that controls the hot water. Rotate the valve clockwise until it\u2019s horizontal with the pipe it\u2019s connected to. This will turn off hot water to your faucet. Put a towel underneath your sink in case any water spills.Tip: If you aren\u2019t sure which valve controls the hot or cold water, try turning one off and feel the water temperature from your faucet.
