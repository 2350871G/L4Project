  "text":" Using Rhinestones Find a cell phone case that fits your phone. You can use a clear one or a colored one. You will be gluing the rhinestones to this case, then slipping it over your phone. Do not glue the rhinestones directly to your phone. Arrange the rhinestones on the back of the phone case. You can use rhinestones that are all the same size and color, or you can experiment with different sizes and/or colors. You can even do a simply design, like an initial or heart.

Check the label on your bottle of glue for more specific drying times. Using Jewelry and Findings Find some blingy items to decorate your case with.

Brooches, cabochons, and scrapbooking embellishments (such as resin roses) work especially well for this. Choose pieces that go well together, or your phone case will look too cluttered.
