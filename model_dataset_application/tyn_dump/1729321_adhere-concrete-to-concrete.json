The acid will also soften the top layer of the concrete and make it ready to bond with the new concrete. Put on a face mask to avoid inhaling the fumes and pour the water into the bucket first, then add the muriatic acid and give the mixture a gentle stir. For example, if you add 7 cups (1,700 mL) of water, add 1 cup (240 mL) of muriatic acid to the water to create an effective cleaning solution.
