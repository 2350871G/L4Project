  "text":" Preparing Your Soap Base Choose your embed materials. Before you make embedded soap you have to decide what you want to embed.

Making Cold Process Soap Prepare your soap-making area. Because you're using lye in cold process soap-making, make sure there are no kids or pets in the area. You'll also want to put on your protective gear: safety goggles and gloves. Add water to your lye. Measure out the lye and water you need for the recipe you're using.

Pour the soap into molds. Once you've added your extras, pour the soap into your molds. Allow them to set for 24 to 48 hours at room temperature.
