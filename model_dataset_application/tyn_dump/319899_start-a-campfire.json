Make sure that the ground is dry, and that there is no chance of your spot being exposed to rain. If you are in a forest, look for a large clearing and build your fire near the center.

Use large stones (as big as your hand) to build the bulk of the barrier, then use smaller stones and soil to fill the cracks. Try to choose dry stones. If you cannot dig, you should still try to build a protective perimeter. Clear any twigs and leaves at least two feet away from the edge of your fire circle."
