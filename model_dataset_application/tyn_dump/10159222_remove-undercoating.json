Typically, you secure it to the top of your tool and twist it into place. A wire wheel is a circular sander featuring crimped, tempered steel bristles. It works well to easily remove rust, corrosion, paint, and primer. Most wire wheels are 6 in (15 cm) in diameter."

With little effort, the wire wheel will remove the undercoating. This is the fastest and easiest removal option. You can start removing the undercoating wherever you'd like. Start at the top of your wheel panel and work your way down to the bottom, for example."

Alternatively, you can use a propane torch instead of a heat gun. The propane torch will heat up the undercoating faster, but they are more dangerous and can start a fire.
