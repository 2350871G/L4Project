This will allow you to push the wreath out through the top of the window, and secure it to the top of the frame. The wreath will hang in front of the window. A double sash window would be ideal, but a double hung window may also work. Cut 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) of wide, outdoor ribbon.

Outdoor ribbon will be the best because you will be closing the window on it. If you can't find outdoor ribbon that you like, use a ribbon made from a sturdy material, such as velvet or grosgrain. Avoid delicate materials, such as sheer or lace. Hot glue one end of the ribbon around your wreath. Coat the end of your ribbon with hot glue and place it against the back of your wreath. Make sure that the end of the ribbon is pointing towards the top/outer edge of the wreath, and that the rest of the ribbon is pointing towards the center. If you don't have hot glue, you can use a U-shaped florist's pin instead. Wrap the ribbon around the top of the wreath twice. Thread the ribbon through the middle of the wreath. Pull it up across the front and over the top. Do this step twice, stopping when you reach the top again. You can secure the ribbon to the front of the wreath with another drop of hot glue for additional security. Add a bow to the top of the wreath for a nicer finish, if desired.
