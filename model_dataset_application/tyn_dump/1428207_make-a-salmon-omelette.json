      "description":"Find a sharp knife. Skinning salmon with a dull blade is both difficult and dangerous. Hold 1 end of the salmon filet with your fingers. Insert your knife between the skin and the meat at a 45-degree angle at the end you are holding the salmon. The edge of the blade should be angled toward the skin. Move the salmon back and forth on the knife. This should cut the salmon easily if your knife is sharp. You should not have to move the knife at all-just the filet."

      "headline":"Gather your frying pan.",
      "description":"Choose a pan that is between 6 inches and 10 inches (15.24 cm and 25.4 cm) in diameter. Any larger and the omelet will spread too thin. Any smaller and the omelet will be too thick to fold. Make sure the frying pan is a non-stick pan. Even though the egg will be fried using vegetable oil or butter, a non-stick pan is essential to ensure proper flipping and removal."

    {
      "headline":"Saut\u00e9 the fillings.",
      "description":"Heat the pan on medium high for 1 minute. Place 1 tablespoon (14.125 g) of butter into the hot pan and let it melt. Pour the onion, green pepper and salmon cubes into the pan and saut\u00e9 them for 2 to 3 minutes. Move the fillings into a small bowl and set it aside."

      "headline":"Cook the eggs.",
      "description":"Crack 2 to 3 large eggs into a mixing bowl and beat thoroughly. Add 2 tablespoons (29.6 mL) of milk into the bowl and continue to whisk until air bubbles form. Place another tablespoon of butter into the same pan as before. Pour the egg/milk mixture into the pan and let the eggs cook for 1 minute. Lift the edges of the egg patty periodically to let uncooked egg into the bottom."

Fold the omelet in half, and place a lid on the pan for about 1 minute for the cheese to melt and the egg to finish cooking. Remove the omelet from heat, turn off the stove and serve."
