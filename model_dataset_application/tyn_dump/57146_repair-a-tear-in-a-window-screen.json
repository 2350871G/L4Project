If you don't have time to let the polish dry for multiple hours, use a hair dryer on the cool setting to quicken the process. Place the blow dryer about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the screen and blast it for about one minute. Clean your window screen with cold water to quicken the drying process. Do not clean your repaired window with hot water, as it can loosen nail polish."

Sewing the screen shut is an option if the hole is too large to use adhesive.

To prep the screen for darning, unravel a few strands from the perimeter of the screen to use as your thread. Line up the window screen seams as neatly as possible.

Patching Holes Tim the damaged area into a neat square or rectangle. Using a straightedge or sharp knife, cut a clean hole around the screen tear. Make this new hole as small as possible to keep it manageable. Leave at least \u20442\u20131 inch (1.3\u20132.5 cm) of screen between the hole and the window frame. Cut a piece of patch screen material for the damaged area. The new patch should be slightly larger than the rectangular hole. Measure the patch before you cut to make certain it is at least  1 inch (2.5 cm) larger than the damaged area. Loosen the perimeter weaving of the opening and the patch. Slack ends around the opening will make it more receptive and adhered to the new patch. Make sure the entire perimeter of the patch is loosened as well.
