    "For example, if your measurement for the needed length for a piece of siding is 118 in (300 cm), subtract 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from this\u2014accounting for the \u201cwiggle room\u201d at each end\u2014and mark the length at 117.75 in (299.1 cm) for cutting.",
    "Measure the siding so it ends on a stud if it is too short to span the wall.",
    "If the wall you\u2019re covering is wider than the length of your pieces of siding, you\u2019ll have to run multiple pieces side-by-side in order to complete a horizontal course.",
    "In this case, measure the pieces of siding so that they meet in the middle of one of the framing studs that are marked on the house wrap.",
    "For instance, say the wall is 16 ft (4.9 m) wide and your pieces of siding are 12 ft (3.7 m) long.",
    "Instead of butting together a full 12 ft (3.7 m) piece and a cut 4 ft (1.2 m) piece that don\u2019t meet over a stud, cut both pieces so that they do meet on a stud.",
    "Remember to subtract the \u201cwiggle room\u201d from each end of each piece.",
    "Wear eye and breathing protection whenever you cut fiber cement.",
    "Fiber cement is a durable product that is easy to work with, but it creates a great deal of dust when you cut it.",
    "Even worse, the dust contains particles that can cause lasting lung problems.",
    "Before cutting any fiber cement, put on a breathing mask or respirator that is (in the U.S.) NIOSH approved at rating N-95.",
    "Keep the dust out of your eyes by wearing full safety goggles as well.",
    "Cut fiber cement outdoors if possible, and always in a well-ventilated area.",
    "Use a saw, scoring knife, or shears to cut fiber cement.",
    "Other than the dust problem, fiber cement cuts easily in a variety of ways.",
    "Consider the pros and cons of the following options:\nCircular saw.",
    "This is the most common option, especially for straight cuts, but it also creates the most dust.",
    "Use a blade designed for cutting fiber cement and attach a dust collecting vacuum to your saw, if possible.",
    "Jigsaw.",
    "This shares the pros and cons of a circular saw, but is easier to use if you need to make any curved cuts.",
    "Fiber cement shears.",
    "These are essentially powered scissors that attach onto the end of a power drill.",
    "They create less dust than saws, and are good for straight and gently-curved cuts.",
    "Scoring knife.",
    "You can cut fiber cement in a process similar to that used for drywall\u2014score the cut line with several passes of a scoring knife, then snap the board at the edge of a work table.",
    "Use a carbide-tipped scoring knife for better results.",
    "Hanging Trim and the First Siding Course Hang the vertical trim pieces with galvanized or stainless nails.",
    "If you\u2019re hanging fiber cement siding, you\u2019ll typically use fiber cement trim from the same manufacturer on areas like inward and outward corners.",
    "Once cut to length (minus the recommended \u201cwiggle room\u201d), attach each trim piece by driving nails through it, the house wrap, and the sheathing and into wood framing.",
    "You can use either a hammer or a nail gun to drive in the nails.",
    "Likewise, you can use either galvanized or stainless steel nails.",
    "The nails should penetrate at least 1 in (2.5 cm) into the framing studs, which makes 1.75 in (4.4 cm) roofing nails a good choice in most cases.",
    "Drive in the nails at least 0.75 in (1.9 cm) from the edge of the piece of trim or siding you\u2019re attaching.",
    "If you\u2019re attaching fiber cement trim and siding to a non-wood wall, like a concrete block wall, you may need to use specialty screws.",
    "Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for installation on alternate types of walls.",
    "Squeeze paintable exterior caulk onto all butt joints and vertical edges.",
    "If there are any spots where the ends of 2 pieces of trim meet (that is, a butt joint), squeeze a 0.125 in (0.32 cm) thick bead of caulk on the ends of each piece before installing the second piece.",
    "Then, when all the trim pieces are in place, run beads of caulk along all vertical edges of the trim.",
    "Follow the same caulking process at any butt joints where 2 pieces of siding meet.",
    "The caulk helps prevent water infiltration at the joints between pieces of fiber cement.",
    "Make sure to pick up paintable, exterior-grade caulk at the home supply store.",
    "Run a horizontal chalk line on the wall to mark the top of the lowest course.",
    "If, for example, your pieces of siding are 8 in (20 cm) high, run the horizontal chalk line 7.75 in (19.7 cm) above the bottom of the strip of wood lath attached to the wall.",
    "The missing 0.25 in (0.64 cm) accounts for the overhang of the siding below the lath.",
    "Attach the siding by blind-nailing it with a hammer or nail gun.",
    "Work with a friend to hold the siding in place along the chalk line.",
    "Drive galvanized or stainless steel nails through the siding at each marked framing stud along the wall, 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top edge of the siding.",
    "This is called \u201cblind nailing,\u201d since the nails will be hidden from view by the overlap of the next course of siding.",
    "Drive the nails flush with the surface of the siding, but not beneath it.",
    "As with the trim pieces, you can use a hammer or a nail gun, and 1.75 in (4.4 cm) roofing nails are usually a good choice for wood-framed walls.",
    "Completing the Siding Job Calculate the \u201creveal\u201d for your courses of siding.",
    "The reveal\u2014the consistent, visible height of each course of siding\u2014should be based on the height of your siding pieces and the height of the wall.",
    "Each course of siding should overlap the one below it by at least 2 in (5.1 cm), so use the following process to calculate the reveal.",
    "Subtract 2 in (5.1 cm) from the height of your siding\u2014for example, 8 in (20 cm) high siding minus 2 in (5.1 cm) equals 6 in (15 cm).",
    "Determine if the above result\u20146 in (15 cm)\u2014divides evenly into the height of the wall.",
    "If it does\u2014for instance, if the wall is 144 in (370 cm) high\u2014you can use a 6 in (15 cm) reveal for 24 courses of siding (since 144 / 6 = 24).",
    "If the result doesn\u2019t divide evenly\u2014for instance, if the wall is 138 in (350 cm) high, reduce the reveal until it does divide evenly.",
    "In this case, making the reveal 5.75 in (14.6 cm) results in 24 even courses of siding (since 138 / 5.75 = 24).",
    "Create a spacer stick to mark the reveal for subsequent siding courses.",
    "Cut a scrap of wood lath to a length that\u2019s exactly the same as your reveal height.",
    "Hold it flush against the bottom of the first course of siding at each framing stud location and use a pencil to mark the reveal height on the siding.",
    "Run a chalk line that connects these markings along the top of the first course of siding.",
    "Repeat this process after hanging each new course of siding.",
    "Using a spacer stick saves some time versus measuring the reveal height for each new course of siding.",
    "Hang the remaining siding courses the same way, overlapping the prior course.",
    "Apply a 0.125 in (0.32 cm) bead of caulk to all vertical joints and butt joints, align the bottom of each piece of siding with the reveal line determined by the spacer stick, and blind nail the siding into studs with galvanized or stainless nails, 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top edge of the siding.",
    "Keep repeating this process as you work your way up the wall.",
    "Cut the siding to leave 0.25 in (0.64 cm) above windows and doors.",
    "If you have to notch out any siding pieces so they fit over the top of a door or window, leave a little extra \u201cwiggle room\u201d for expansion and water flow.",
    "Instead of 0.125 in (0.32 cm), leave twice that amount between the top of the window or door frame (covered by flashing) and the cut portion of the siding.",
    "Unlike your other joints, do not apply caulk to the edge of the siding that\u2019s right above the window or door.",
    "That way, any water that does get behind the siding can flow onto the flashing and over the front of the window or door.",
    "Apply more paintable exterior caulk to ends, corners, and joints.",
    "Add another 0.125 in (0.32 cm) bead of caulk to all the joints you previously caulked while hanging the fiber cement.",
    "These include any butt joints in the trim, butt joints between pieces of siding, vertical (but not horizontal) joints between siding and window or door frames, and joints between trim pieces and siding pieces.",
    "Make sure you use exterior-grade caulk that will hold up to the elements, and paintable caulk so that you can conceal it when you paint the siding.",
    "Paint the siding within days whenever possible.",
    "If your fiber cement came pre-primed (as is often the case), touch up any spots where the primer was scraped or scratched off with an exterior-grade, 100% acrylic latex primer.",
    "If necessary, you can wait up to 6 months to paint primed siding with 1-2 coats of exterior-grade, 100% acrylic latex paint, but it\u2019s best to paint it as soon as possible.",
    "If the fiber cement isn\u2019t pre-primed, add a full primer coat, then 1-2 coats (as needed) of paint.",
    "Priming and painting are necessary to help the fiber cement stand up to the elements."
