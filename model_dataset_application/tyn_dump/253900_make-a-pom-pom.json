You can now use your finish pom pom by attaching it to a knitting or crochet project. Use the yarn tails to attach it to a hat, scarf, sweater, or whatever you want. Making Cheering Pom Poms Layer 10 trash bags on top of each other. Trash bags are usually only available in white and black, but you may be able to find other colors, too. If you are using different colors, then layer the trash bags so that the colors are alternating if you like or keep the colors together. Cut off the tops and the bottoms of the trash bags. Cut off the top 1\" or so of the trash bag where the drawstring is. Discard this material. Fold the trash bags. Fold the trash bags so that the tops and bottoms are lined up. Try to get all of the layers as even as possible. Cut the bags along the folded line. Cut the bags along the fold you just made so that you have a pile of 20 trash bag squares. Cut carefully and try not to leave any jagged edges. Cut slits in the bag. Start cutting from the edge into the center from the side you just cut. Cut slits in the bags every 1/2 - 1\", depending on your preference. Repeat the same cuts on the opposite side. Make the cuts from both ends and stop evenly, leaving roughly 2\" uncut at the center. Gather the bags. Gather the bags at the center, like holding a bunch of dry pasta, so that your fingers are around the uncut center and the strips you made are hanging.

Next, take the individual strips and begin to separate each piece of plastic. This will give the pom pom its volume. Crinkle the strips of plastic once they're pulled apart to make it even fuller. Your pom pom is ready to use! Make another so you have a matching pair. Making Tissue Paper Pom Poms Lay out eight sheets of tissue paper. Place the tissue paper on a flat surface and make sure that all of the edges are even. You can use less tissue paper for smaller pom poms, or more for larger, fuller pom poms. Fold length-wise in an accordion-fold pattern. Begin folding at one end of the tissue paper pile and fold the pieces in an accordion-fold pattern.
