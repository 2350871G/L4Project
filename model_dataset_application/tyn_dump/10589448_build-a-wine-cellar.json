          "description":"Despite what the term suggests, just about any room can be used as a wine cellar as long as it\u2019s well-insulated. Basements and cellars are among the best choices since they\u2019ll already be cooler than other parts of your home, but you could also use a game room, spare bedroom, or even an unused closet. The exact size of your wine cellar will depend on the space you have available, as well as the amount of wine you want to preserve. When it comes to wine cellars, the cooler, the better. If possible, pick out a room that receives little or no direct exposure to sunlight throughout the day.Warning: Don't designate an attic or garage for your wine cellar, as these spaces tend to be difficult to insulate properly."

          "description":"To convert an ordinary room to a wine cellar, you\u2019ll be installing a special cooling system that pumps warm exhaust air into a neighboring room. Try to select a room that contains at least one door, window, or air vent to allow the warm air to escape. Most cooling systems only guarantee a 30-50 degree temperature differential. For this reason, it\u2019s important that the adjacent room be no warmer than 85\u2013100 \u00b0F (29\u201338 \u00b0C) to maintain the recommended temperature of 50\u201355 \u00b0F (10\u201313 \u00b0C)  in the cellar. If you\u2019re building your wine cellar in a basement, you won\u2019t have to worry about ventilating any other rooms, as the warm air will simply be dispersed outside."

Stretch and smooth each section so that it lays as flush as possible. Secure the vapor barrier along the edges with foil-backed tape to ensure that it stays in place. Ask someone to assist you when it comes time to apply your barrier materials to the ceiling. A preliminary vapor barrier will keep out unwanted moisture that could interfere with the humidity levels in your wine cellar."

Position the boards vertically around the perimeter of the room on the inside of the vapor barrier, leaving 16 inches (41 cm) of space between each. Secure the joists with 2-3 nails at both the top and bottom ends. Do the same for the ceiling using 2 in (5.1 cm) x 8 in (20 cm) boards. You might be able to get away with not framing the ceiling of your space if it's constructed of concrete. The purpose of framing is to create enough distance between the outer walls and the room\u2019s interior to install an extra layer of insulation, which will help maintain the right temperature for preservation and aging."

For smaller spaces like closets, you can also use blown-in types of insulation like shredded fiberglass or low-dust cellulose for ease of installation. Experts recommend using insulation with a rating of at least R-19 for wine cellar walls, and at least R-30 for ceilings. This means the insulation will be about 5.5 inches (14 cm) thick on each side, with a 10 in (25 cm) layer along the ceiling. If you decide to go with a blown-in insulation, be sure to apply an additional vapor barrier to the inside of the frame joists to properly contain it."

Score your sheets to the right dimensions with a utility knife, then fasten them to the joists every 12 inches (30 cm) using drywall screws. Use 5-6 screws for each side of each sheet. Be sure to tape over the seams between each sheet so they won\u2019t be visible in the finished wall. Lightweight gypsum board, or \u201cgreen board,\u201d can perform the same function as drywall or sheetrock, but with even greater moisture-resistant properties."

          "description":"Smooth on 2-3 even coats of paint in your shade of choice, allowing each coat to dry for 12-24 hours before applying follow-up coats. For maximum protection and durability, use a polyvinyl acetate (PVA) paint formula. PVA paints offer a smooth, resilient finish and serve as an additional barrier against moisture. Painting in small, enclosed spaces increase your risk of exposure to harmful fumes. Be sure to open any nearby doors and windows and leave the air conditioning or a portable fan running to promote ventilation. Another possible option is to have wood paneling installed rather than painting. Choose a rot-resistant type of wood, such as redwood, cedar, or pressure-treated pine, to prevent warping as a result of the surrounding humidity."

    "Wine racks come in all different sizes and styles, so be sure to shop around to find a set that speaks to your sensibilities.Tip: Most connoisseurs prefer wooden wine racks, as metal racks are more likely to scratch or tear labels.",
    "Install showroom-style lighting to highlight prized vintages.",
    "Mount light fixtures on the ceiling or floor at regular intervals and position them to point at your racks at upwards or downwards angles.",
    "They'll illuminate the selections you\u2019re most proud of in a more impressive fashion than you could with ordinary ceiling lighting.",
    "Some enthusiasts opt to avoid lighting altogether, since bright light can warm the room and impact the flavor of the wine.",
    "If you do decide to include a few decorative fixtures, make sure you use a low-voltage variety, such as fluorescent bulbs or LEDs.",
    "Be careful not to damage your vapor barrier while installing and situating your light fixtures.",
    "Set aside one corner of your wine cellar to use for tastings.",
    "When it comes time to begin decorating your completed wine cellar, set out a table and a few comfortable chairs, or spend a little extra putting in a bar and some stools.",
    "That way, you and your friends can get together to enjoy a private sampling or chat over a glass of your finest reserve.",
    "You could even add a tasting area to a compact wine cellar by installing a short section of countertop with room for a handful of individual racks, similar to a sink in a half-bath."
