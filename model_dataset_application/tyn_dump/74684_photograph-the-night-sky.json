          "description":"Attach your DSLR to a sturdy tripod so it won't move or shake. Open the aperture (f-stop) of the camera to at least f/2.8 or wider so you let in a lot of light. The aperture refers to the hole through which light enters the camera. To let more light into the camera, adjust the aperture to a wider f-stop like f/2 or f/1.4. Consider using a cable release to capture the image, especially if you're leaving the shutter open for more than 30 seconds. This will reduce the chance that you bump or shake the camera."

          "description":"Check your camera settings to determine its range of light sensitivity. By dialing up the ISO, your camera will pick up more details in the low light of the night sky. Try photographing with as high of an ISO as your camera has such as 1600 or 3200. Keep in mind that shooting at a higher ISO can increase the noise (make the photo grainy), so you'll have to edit in post-production. If you're using a film camera, you'll need to load it with high ISO film.

Don't leave your white balance setting set to daylight or automatic, which will make the night images come out too warm.

Keep in mind that slow shutter speeds will blur any action taking place in the picture such as shooting stars. The manual shutter speed might be bulb on your camera.
