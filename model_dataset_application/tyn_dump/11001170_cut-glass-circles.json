You will be able to cut a circle out of glass that is up to about 25 mm with this method. If you are just starting out with glass cutting, then it is easier to see what you are doing with transparent glass. It's also a good idea to practice on some scrap pieces of glass to get the hang of it."

Use your dominant hand to apply continuous pressure while rotating the cutting wheel arm 360 degrees around the piece of glass. Tip: Starting the motion a bit to the left of the top center of the circle (if you are right handed) will make it more comfortable to complete the full rotation. Make sure you do a full 360-degree rotation without stopping or letting up pressure to create an even score line. You will hear a scratching noise as you rotate the cutter if you are applying enough pressure."

Tip: Smaller circles will require more pressure to run the score because they don't separate as easily from the rest of the glass. If you use clear glass, then you will be able to see the score line running (the glass breaking along the line) more easily. If the glass is opaque or colored then you will have to look more carefully."

Hold the circle with your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to carefully break away each outer section one-by-one. Do this above the towel and close to the work surface so that if you accidentally drop the glass there is less chance of it breaking. Use running pliers as an alternative to your hands if you have a pair. Running pliers are flat-headed pliers with rubber grips so that they won't break the glass. If you did everything properly to this point, then the sides will break away without much effort. Glass cutting takes patience and practice, so don't get discouraged if your first circle isn't perfect!"
