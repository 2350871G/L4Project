A pasting table is a folding table designed specifically for cutting and pasting things like wallpaper. Roll out your first roll of lining paper on the board to prepare to measure and cut it. You can get a pasting table at a home improvement center if you don\u2019t have one. Mark a section as long as the height of the wall plus a little extra for trimming.

You can do all the cutting at the beginning, or alternately cut and paste as you go. It\u2019s up to you and how you prefer to work. Pasting the Lining Paper to the Wall Apply wallpaper paste to the back of the lining paper with a pasting brush. Place your first section of lining paper flat on the pasting table. Cover the entire back, right up to the edges, with wallpaper paste. Make sure to always refer to the instructions for the adhesive you are using before you apply it to check for any special instructions, such as how long you need to let the paste soak in.
