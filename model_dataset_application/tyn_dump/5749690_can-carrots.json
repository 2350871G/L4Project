Use caution when removing the jars. They'll be very hot after sterilizing. You can also use a water bath canner to sterilize your jars. Place your jars onto the rack of the canner and fill it with enough water so the jars are filled. Boil the jars in the canner for 10 minutes, then use your jar lifter to remove the hot jars. Lids cannot be sterilized through the previously mentioned methods. Doing so can damage the sealing compound on them.
