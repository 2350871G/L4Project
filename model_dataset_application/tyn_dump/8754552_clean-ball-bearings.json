While using a skate tool is the preferred method, you can also use a screwdriver to poke out the bearing casing. If you have a skateboard, you can use the axle to poke out the bearing casing.

If your bearings have a rubber seal, use a paperclip to carefully pry off the seal. Alternatively, you might have a metal seal secured by a C-clip. Use a utility knife to pry out the C-clip, then tap the metal seal out. You\u2019ll be able to see the outline of the C-clip if your metal seal is removable. If the seal is pressed with no visible seam or outline, the seal is not removable and you will not be able to access the ball bearings."

A citrus cleaner is the safest choice, but might leave a residue on the casings. Isopropyl alcohol and acetone are stronger and won\u2019t leave residue, but are skin irritants and emit hazardous fumes.

    "For the rear wheel, you\u2019ll have to remove the cassette in order to access the cup-and-cone.",
    "You\u2019ll need a cassette removal tool, which you can find online or at a bike shop, to fit into the cassette and loosen the locking nut.",
    "Set the lug nuts and any washers or spacers aside in proper order to make reassembly easier.",
    "Lift the ball bearings out each side of the hub.",
    "Once you\u2019ve removed the cone, you can access the ball bearings, which sit on each side of the hub.",
    "Use a scalpel blade or narrow utility knife to carefully pull the balls out from the seat on each side.",
    "There are also magnet tools, which look like magnetic sticks, that make it much easier to pull out the ball bearings.",
    "If you use a blade, spray a little grease onto it so the balls will stick to it.",
    "That\u2019ll make it easier to pull them out from their seat.",
    "Keep the ball bearings separate so you know which side is which.",
    "Degrease and wipe the balls and bearing seat.",
    "Spray the ball bearings with an aerosol degreaser and wipe them down with a rag.",
    "Fit a small straw into the nozzle of the aerosol degreaser and spray inside the bearing seat.",
    "Wipe inside the seat by wrapping your finger in a rag.",
    "Wear gloves when using a degreaser.",
    "Pack grease into the bearing seat before reassembling the hub.",
    "Use your grease gun to pack a thick layer of grease into the bearing seat.",
    "Any excess will simply work it\u2019s way out, so pack liberally and don\u2019t worry about adding too much.",
    "If necessary, use your finger to work grease all around the bearing seat.",
    "Insert the ball bearings back into each seat and add more grease.",
    "When replacing the ball bearings, it\u2019s possible to miss the seat, causing the balls to drop through the hub and come out the other side.",
    "To prevent this, you can place the axle through the hub, but in the opposite way that it would normally fit.",
    "That way, the tip of the axle will prevent the ball bearings from falling through, making it easier to slide them into their seat.",
    "Pack even more grease into the bearing seat after you slide the ball bearings back into place.",
    "Once you\u2019ve inserted the bearings one one side of the hub, repeat the process on the other side.",
    "Replace the cone, spacers, and lug nut.",
    "Slide the axle through the hub and place the cone over it.",
    "Replace any washers or spacers you removed.",
    "Twist the lug onto the threaded axle by hand, then tighten it until it\u2019s snug with the cone spacers using the cone spanners.",
    "For the rear wheel, place the cassette back onto the hub and tighten its locking nut using the cassette tool."
