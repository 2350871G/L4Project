Make sure you apply the insecticide directly to the mites. Repeat the process as necessary until the mites are gone. Indoor-safe insecticide comes in both standard spray bottles and aerosol cans.

Check the label of an insecticidal soap before using it on your pet. Most soaps are animal safe, but some may not be."
