Cut 3 to 4 pieces of yarn 2 times the height of your compost bin. Grab the compost bin that you are going to use for your experiment and measure out 1 piece of yarn for each of your test squares. Make sure the yarn pieces are about twice the height of the compost bin so that they can hang outside of it during your experiment.If you don\u2019t have yarn, you can use twine instead. Tie each piece of yarn to each square of your test product. Cut a slit or a small hole in each of your test squares using scissors. Thread a piece of yarn through the slit and make a knot in 1 end on each test square. Make sure your knots are secure and that they won\u2019t slip out during your experiment.
