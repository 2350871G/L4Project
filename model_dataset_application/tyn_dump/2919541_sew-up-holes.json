If the fabric is soft or thin, you may use any needle \u2013 though you might want to use a more delicate needle. Cotton, nylon, silk, jute, mixed fabric, and any other thin, soft fabric is better stitched with  a lighter needles. The needle can be as short as 1-2 inches, or longer as needed. If you use a thick needle\u2014approximately 1 mm in thickness\u2014it may leave visible holes in the fabric. You may use a finger cap to prevent being poked by the needle while stitching. Opt for a thicker needle to avoid breaking any needles. Use a solid board to push the needle through while stitching if your finger hurts. Some thick fabrics like denim need pushing against a hard surface."

The in-and-out sewing motion will take up a lot of thread, and you'll also need a bit more thread than the needle's length in order to tie the final knot. Remember: the thicker the fabric, the more thread you'll need. You may choose to take two times more thread if the fabric is thicker than 5mm."

Sometimes, you will need to deal with top-stitching rather than a seam: as in an applique or a patch pocket.

Then, bring the edges of the hole as close together as possible, without puckering the hole. Use a small zig zag stitch on the sewing machine to stitch around the edges of hole, catching as much fabric (patch and garment) as possible to make the patch hold. This isn't going to be a \"pretty fix,\" but it should be serviceable. If the garment is casual, you can buy extra fabric in a contrasting color or pattern and sew patches in several areas to make the hole patch look decorative.

Stitching a little back from the ends will support the fabric and stop further tearing. Slip the needle through the cloth, and carefully weave the thread in and out of the cloth. For consistency, try to keep the distance between each stitch to about 2 mm. If the hole is especially frayed, try reinforcing with a liquid seam sealant before you start stitching. This can help make the fix more sustainable. If the cloth is too tight, a stitch may tear again once you wear the garment. Try adding another layer of a piece of a cloth beneath the hole, and then stitching that cloth for added strength. Try stitching a button to the area, if it goes with the fabric.
