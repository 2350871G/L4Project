Spray the affected area with a good carpet cleaner, especially one designed for pet stains, and blot it with a cloth. Finally, rinse the area with water and blot it dry. Your urge may be to remove the hairball right away, but it's best to let the hairball firm up a bit before removal. Blot the area lightly; do not apply too much pressure, as this may cause the stain to penetrate deeper into the carpeting."
