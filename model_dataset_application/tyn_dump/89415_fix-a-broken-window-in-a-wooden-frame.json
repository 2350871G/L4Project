Consider just taking the window to a local hardware store and let them replace the glass.

Use a vacuum to clean up any small shards."

Also remove any of the old glazier's points from the broken pane; it's a good idea to save them in case they're a different size from the modern points. Use the metal brush to get the surface as clean as possible. Optional step: carefully brush linseed oil on the surfaces that will be holding the caulk. This extends the life of your caulk job, but it takes a day or more to dry, so plan your time accordingly. It is a very good idea to prime the wood with exterior primer or use exterior varnish to seal the wood. This will make the wood last decades. Without sealing the wood, it might rot in only a few years."

Using 1/16th of an inch smaller makes fit tighter and is better for supporting the wood. If you use glass the same size as the opening, it will stretch the wood and might make the window harder to fit (or leave small gaps at the corners where water will get in and rot the wood)."

When you're just about there, carefully lay the glass almost flat, then guide it as you slide it into the groove at the top of the window.
