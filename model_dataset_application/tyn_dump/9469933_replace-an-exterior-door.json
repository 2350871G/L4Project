  "text":" Removing the Old Door Hammer the hinge pins loose with a chisel. Hold the chisel or a punch underneath the hinge. Tap it into the hinge with a hammer. It'll raise the pin in the hinge, which you can remove and set aside. Swing and lift the door to remove it. Swing the door inwards, then lift it off the frame. It'll be heavy, so it helps to have someone else hold onto 1 end. Lay a towel on the floor in the doorway to protect the floor from damage. Slice through the trim caulking with a utility knife. Cut through the caulking to remove the door trim on both sides. Angle the utility knife towards the trim, then cut the caulk all the way around the door. To avoid messing up the paint on the wall, be sure to make clean cuts that penetrate all the way through the caulking. Pry off the old trim with a pry bar. Hold a wide putty knife or block of wood against the wall. Rest the back end of the pry bar on it to avoid damaging the walls. Slip the pry bar underneath the trim to leverage it off. Do this on both sides of the door. If you're going to reuse the old trim, be careful not to damage it. Use a hand saw to remove the door frame.

Move slowly to avoid cutting into the wall itself. You can also slide a reciprocating saw between the frame and wall, using it to cut off the nails holding the frame in place. Fitting the Sill and Door Level the door sill with shims. Lay a flat piece of treated lumber in the doorway to form the sill. Check it with a level. You want the sill to be as flat as possible.

Pick up a roll of weather-resistant flashing tape at the home improvement store. Lay the tape from side to side. Wrap the excess tape over the front edge of the sill and up the doorway. Make sure the door is square. Measure the door from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. Then, measure the door from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. The measurements should be exactly the same. If they're not, the door isn't square and needs to be adjusted. Set the door in the opening to check the fit. Hold the door and frame in the opening. Use a level to make sure they're plumb. Be sure to hold the door trim up to gauge whether or not there's enough room for it. You may need to make adjustments to fit them all. Sand or saw the door to size. If there isn't enough space for the door, frame, and trim, you'll have to reduce the size of the door. Once the frame is set, you can adjust the door with a belt sander or circular saw. It's also possible to sand down the siding in the doorway to create the extra space. Installing the New Door Caulk along the door opening. Squeeze a bead of polyurethane caulk between the door opening and wall. Drag the caulk along the sides and top of the doorway.

Shim the other sides of the doorframe. Start with the latch side of the door. Place plywood and shims at the top, middle, and bottom of this side to level it.
