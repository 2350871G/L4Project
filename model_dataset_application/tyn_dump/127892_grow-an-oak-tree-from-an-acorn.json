          "description":"Acorns are best harvested in the early-to-mid autumn before they have fallen from the tree.Choose acorns that are free of worms, holes, and fungus. Suitable acorns should be brownish with slight tinges of green remaining, though the appearance of acorns can vary based on the type of oak tree they come from. A good general rule is that acorns are ready for picking when they can be removed from the cap without tearing them. Note that the cap is not part of the acorn, but a (separate) protective covering. By removing the acorn from the cap you are not damaging it unless you  tear the acorn itself. If possible, look for suitable trees in the summer. You'll want mature trees whose acorns are easily-reached via ladder or with a long pole. Some oak varieties, like red oaks, have acorns that take two years to mature, rather than one. As you pick suitable trees in the summer, keep this in mind - the acorns on some oaks will be ready in the fall, while others won't be ready until the following year."

An acorn may float because a worm or grub has burrowed into it, creating an air hole. Similarly, a fungus can make the acorn float. If, at any point, you notice that an acorn is soft to the touch, discard it as well. Soft, mushy acorns are rotten."

Put the bag in the refrigerator for a month and a half or longer - as long as is needed to germinate the new oak. This process is known as stratification, which is simply exposing a seed to cold temperatures, mimicking the natural conditions that a seed would experience had it fallen to the ground. This primes the seed for sprouting in the spring. Periodically check on your acorns. The medium should be just barely moist. Too moist, and the acorns may rot. Too dry, and they may not grow."

Plant your acorn just below the surface with the root facing down. If using a styrofoam cup or milk carton, poke holes in the sides of the cup near the bottom so that water can escape. If you prefer, you can also try just burying the acorn in the yard. Bury the root in a shallow hole and gently tuck the acorn to one side on top of suitable rich, soft soil. This will only work if the taproot is already well established, long, and has detached adequately from the acorn.

To ensure your young oak trees aren't devoured,  take steps to protect them. Cage your young trees with chicken wire or sturdy plastic fencing around their stem to prevent animals from reaching them. If you live in an area where deer are common, you may even want to consider caging the top of the tree.

During the winter and wet months, it's not usually necessary to water your oak trees. However, when oaks are young, hot and dry weather can be damaging. A drip irrigation system is a useful way to get water to young oak trees when they need it most. Irrigate your tree with about 10 gallons (38 liters) of water via drip irrigation system every week to two weeks. Irrigate during the hottest and driest months for about two years, lessening the irrigation frequency as the tree grows. Remember not to allow water to collect around the base of the tree.

Eventually, it will be big and tall enough that animals won't be able to kill it and its roots will be deep enough for it to survive the summer without any watering. Slowly, over several years, reduce the amount of care you give your tree (which, aside from watering during dry months and protecting it from animals, should not be all that much). Eventually, your tree should be able to thrive on its own without showing any signs of distress. Enjoy the lifelong gift you've given yourself and your family!

    "Taproot facing down and leaves facing up, gently place your oak into the hole you've prepared.",
    "Make sure the hole is deep enough to accommodate the oak's roots.",
    "Replace the dirt around the plant, packing it in lightly.",
    "Water your seedling after planting it.",
    "Pack soil around the oak seedling, sloping the soil away from the seedling so that water does not sit at the trunk of the tree, which can be damaging.",
    "Lay a circular ring of mulch about one foot (.3 meters) around the tree to help the soil retain moisture and discourage the growth of weeds.",
    "Make sure it does not touch the stem of the tree.",
    "To increase the chances of a successful planting, you may want to place several acorns in the same area.",
    "In this case, plant young seedling acorns directly into the ground by clearing a 2x2 foot (61 cm x 61 cm) area and placing two acorns into that space, with one or two inches (2.5 cm - 5 cm) of soil on top.",
    "Caring for Growing Oaks Protect young oak trees.",
    "Oak trees - especially young, fragile ones - are a source of food for many herbivorous animals.",
    "Acorns are a frequent snack for squirrels and mice, who can easily dig them up.",
    "Small seedlings are also vulnerable to rabbits, deer, and other animals that like to eat leaves.",
    "To ensure your young oak trees aren't devoured,  take steps to protect them.",
    "Cage your young trees with chicken wire or sturdy plastic fencing around their stem to prevent animals from reaching them.",
    "If you live in an area where deer are common, you may even want to consider caging the top of the tree.",
    "You may also want to use pesticides to protect your tree from a variety of pests, including aphids and June bugs.",
    "Use caution when selecting pesticides - only use ones that are not harmful to your oak tree or your family.",
    "Irrigate trees in dry weather.",
    "An oak's long taproot allows it to draw moisture from deep soils even when surface soils have been completely dried out.",
    "During the winter and wet months, it's not usually necessary to water your oak trees.",
    "However, when oaks are young, hot and dry weather can be damaging.",
    "A drip irrigation system is a useful way to get water to young oak trees when they need it most.",
    "Irrigate your tree with about 10 gallons (38 liters) of water via drip irrigation system every week to two weeks.",
    "Irrigate during the hottest and driest months for about two years, lessening the irrigation frequency as the tree grows.",
    "Remember not to allow water to collect around the base of the tree.",
    "Arrange your irrigation system so that water drips around the tree, not directly onto its base, where it can cause rot.",
    "Taper your care off as the tree grows.",
    "As your oak grows and its roots deepen, you will need to care for it less and less.",
    "Eventually, it will be big and tall enough that animals won't be able to kill it and its roots will be deep enough for it to survive the summer without any watering.",
    "Slowly, over several years, reduce the amount of care you give your tree (which, aside from watering during dry months and protecting it from animals, should not be all that much).",
    "Eventually, your tree should be able to thrive on its own without showing any signs of distress.",
    "Enjoy the lifelong gift you've given yourself and your family!",
    "Within 20 years, your oak may begin producing acorns of its own, though, depending on the species, optimal acorn growth may not occur for up to 50 years."
