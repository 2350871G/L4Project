Cut the flaps in half, leaving them attached to the box still. To draw the flaps together when the horse is inside, push in a thumbtack in the middle opening edge of each door. Wind thread around one tack of a top door, and one of another door. Glue in place to keep on these two doors permanently. When you wish to close the doors, simply wind the unglued end of thread around the other two thumb tacks and the doors will stay shut. (Other methods can also be improvised.) Draw a wood paneling design on the barn doors to make it seem more realistic. Cut out a window on the sides of the barn. Draw grooming gear and tack on the back wall of the barn.

Use a green sheet of fabric and cut it large enough for the horse to \"feed\" on. Make feeding buckets from egg cartons. Cut one egg carton hole off the egg carton. Poke holes each side of the open end of the egg carton hole. Feed thin gauge wire through each hole to form a semi-circle handle. Wind into place each end. Done. Make a water trough.

Hang onto the barn. Making a Saddle Trace a saddle shape on flexible cardboard. You can find shapes for saddles by searching online. Be sure to use measurements that fit the horse's size. Cut out the saddle shape.  Make it more realistic by adding fabric. Choose fleece or pleather (artificial leather). Trace the same shape onto the fabric, cut it out and adhere to the outer side of the cardboard. Use a small hole puncher to make two holes on each side of the saddle. Thread ribbon or string through this for a girth. Try it on the horse. Tie in place.",
