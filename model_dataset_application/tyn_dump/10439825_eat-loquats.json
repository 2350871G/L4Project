Once it's nice and clean, shake off the excess water or pat it dry with a paper towel.Since loquats are typically eaten with the skin on like an apple, it's important to make sure they've been properly cleaned. A colander or wire strainer can make it easier to rinse a whole batch of loquats at once."

          "description":"Pinch the long, woody stem at the top of the fruit between your point finger and thumb. Give the stem a sharp twist while holding the loquat steady with your other hand. It should come away with little effort.If the stem is giving you trouble, just cut off the entire top portion of the fruit down to about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) rather than continuing to tug on it."

Then, rotate the loquat in your hand and continue cutting along the opposite side until you've scored the entire outer edge of the fruit.Loquats tend to be quite small, which can make them tough to grip. Be careful not to lose control of your knife while trying to hold onto the fruit."

Inside, you'll find juicy, yellow-orange flesh surrounding a core of large seeds. Loquats bruise easily, so try not to squeeze it too hard."

Once you've worked the seeds out, discard them.The seeds of a loquat are mildly poisonous, so they shouldn't be eaten with the rest of the fruit. If you happen to swallow one or two by accident, don't worry\u2014the worst that's likely to happen is a little headache, dizziness, or upset stomach. If the membrane around the seeds is tough, you can remove it as well by simply peeling it away."

For optimum flavor and texture, try to consume them as soon as possible.To maximize the shelf life of your loquats, wrap them loosely in a plastic bag or paper towel. If you're already cut your loquats, their shelf life may be reduced to 2-3 days."

A perfectly ripe loquat should have a sweet, perfumed flavor similar to a peach or apricot, with just a hint of citrusy tartness.

The loquats lend a unique flavor and a splash of vibrant color to the ensemble.Use sugary fruits like strawberries, blueberries, banana, and kiwi to offset the sharp notes of the loquats.
