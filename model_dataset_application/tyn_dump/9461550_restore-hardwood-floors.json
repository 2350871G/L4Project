Make sure there aren\u2019t any puddles forming, and if there are, wipe the excess away with a rag. Overlap your next section of stain. While the stain in the first section is still wet, start the next 2 sq ft (0.19 m) section right next to it. Use your applicator to spread the stain over the area, overlapping the edge of the first section by 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) so you don\u2019t miss any spots and get even color. You can buy wood stain from paint and home improvement stores. Buy a lambswool applicator from a local hardware store or paint shop. Work quickly so the stain doesn\u2019t have time to dry. If the edges of the sections dry before you work on the next section, your floor will look like it has stripes. Use a 2 in (5.1 cm) paintbrush to stain the corners. Dip the end of the paintbrush into the stain and apply a thin coat in the corner and along the wall. Follow the grain of your floorboards to help hide any brushstrokes. Make sure to work the stain all the way to corner so you don\u2019t miss any spots. Tip: Work in the corners and baseboards as you make your way around the room. That way, you can blend your edges easily. Let the stain dry overnight to see its true color. Your stain might look darker when you first apply it since it hasn\u2019t absorbed into the wood fully. Allow the stain to dry and set completely, which usually takes about 8-12 hours. Once the stain is dry, look at the color to see if you\u2019re happy with it. If you want to stain your floors darker, apply another thin coat of stain. Applying Polyurethane Ventilate the room before you begin. Polyurethane has a very strong odor and it can be overwhelming in a small space. Open as many windows and doors as possible to get proper ventilation. You can also wear a paper face mask to protect yourself from the fumes. Stir the polyurethane. Take the lid off of the polyurethane can and use a paint stir stick to mix the polyurethane. Don\u2019t shake the can to stir the polyurethane since it could form air bubble and leave an uneven finish on your floors. You can buy polyurethane sealer from your local hardware or home improvement stores. Clean the applicators you\u2019re using for your polyurethane. Use a lambswool stain applicator and a natural-bristle paintbrush to apply the polyurethane. Stick a piece of painter\u2019s tape on the stain applicator to remove any excess fibers so they don\u2019t get stuck in the sealant. Pull out any loose bristles from the paintbrush before using it. You can buy stain applicators from your local hardware store. Begin in the far corner of the room with the brush. Starting in the corner farthest from the door, use the brush to apply polyurethane near the wall. Dip the brush into the polyurethane can and gently brush a thin layer about 4 inches (10 cm) into the room from the wall. After you paint a border around the room, use the lambswool applicator to spread the polyurethane. Work backward toward the door so you can easily get out when you\u2019re finished. Make sure you overlap each stroke slightly to get an even finish. Let the polyurethane dry before applying a second coat. The manufacturer\u2019s instructions should tell you how long to let the polyurethane dry, but it should be anywhere from 8 hours to overnight. Apply a second coat of the polyurethane and let it dry. Repeat the same process as before for your second coat. Start around the edges of your room and work toward the center. Make sure you get even coverage with the polyurethane so your floor is level. Let the polyurethane dry for 2-3 days before using the room.If the floor feels sticky or tacky, then let it dry for longer. Refinishing Scratched Floors Clear out the room and clean your floors. Make sure you remove all furniture from the room or rooms where you want to refinish the floors. Vacuum the floor to get up any dirt or debris that might be there. Spray a hardwood floor cleaner on the floor and then wipe the floor with a terrycloth mop. You can find hardwood floor cleaner at most home improvement stores. If you can\u2019t find any, you can mix your own with 10 parts water to 1 part white vinegar. If you don\u2019t have a terrycloth mop, you can wrap a towel around your mop head instead. Sand the perimeter of the room using 180-grit sandpaper. Work by hand so you can get closer to the wall than you could with a large sander. Sand 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) into the room from the wall. Keep sanding until the floors look dull and dust forms. The sanded floors will look considerably lighter than the rest of the room since you\u2019ve sanded down past any existing finish. Buff the rest of the room with a buffer. Rent a buffer from a home improvement store so you can use it for the day. Start buffing near the far corner, and follow the grain of the wood floor across the room. As you move down each row, move the buffer side to side to get an even finish. Overlap each row by about 6 inches (15 cm) so you don\u2019t miss any spots. The old finish will turn into a white powder so you can easily see where you\u2019ve worked. Use a maroon buffing pad since it has the correct grit to sand the rest of the floor. Keep the buffer on constantly, but stop every 5 minutes to vacuum the pad. Tilt the buffer up and use a vacuum extension to pull the dust off. Vacuum the floor. Put a new filter in your vacuum, or clean out the filter if it\u2019s reusable. Attach a felt-bottomed attachment to your vacuum to protect your floors from any damage. Work in the direction of the flooring strips, sweeping the attachment back and forth to suck up all the dust. Then work across the flooring strips to get any dust settled in between them. If you don\u2019t have a felt-bottomed attachment for your vacuum, a brush attachment will also work. Dry-tack the floor. Wrap a large microfiber cloth around a dry mop or broom, and secure it in place. Push the cloth across the floor in the same direction as the flooring strips to get up the very last of the dust. Work in tight areas along the wall or in corners where dust may easily form. Strain the new finish through an old watering can. Cover your shoes with booties and wear a respirator that has organic vapor canisters to protect your lungs. Pour the stain through a cone filter into a plastic watering can to strain out any contaminants. Pour the stain from the watering can into a small plastic container. Apply a strip of stain around the edge of your room. Start at the corner farthest from the door so you don\u2019t get stuck when you\u2019re finished applying the stain. Using a 3 in (7.6 cm) paintbrush, apply a strip of stain next to the baseboards that\u2019s about 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick. Get as far as you can around your room in 10 minutes before moving on. This process is known as \"cutting in.\" Working on the edges first makes it easier to work without missing any tight spots. Roll stain onto the rest of the floor. Pour a 1 in (2.5 cm) strip of stain onto the floor next to the strip you just painted on. Use a long-handled roller with a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) nap cover. Roll the finish out along the grain and then across it, overlapping each pass. Pour as much stain as you can spread in 10 minutes or else your floor may look striped or uneven. Repeat the cutting in and rolling out procedure every 10 minutes. You\u2019ll need to work with wet stain to ensure that you don\u2019t end up with visible strips on the floor. Once you\u2019ve rolled out finish for 10 minutes, go back to cutting in the edges for 10 minutes. Then roll out stain for 10 minutes, repeating the procedure until you\u2019ve covered the entire floor. Wait 3 hours to apply a second coat. If you\u2019re looking for a darker stain, you might need to apply more than one coat. Wait 3 hours in between applying each coat of stain so the coat before it has time to dry. Wait a week to replace furniture. Once you\u2019ve achieved the shade of stain you want, you\u2019ll need to let the floor dry completely. Wait a full week before you replace any furniture or accessories.",
