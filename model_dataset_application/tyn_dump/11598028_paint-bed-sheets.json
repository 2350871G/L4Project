After that, put your sheets in the drier and run it on the hottest setting. Allow the sheets to dry completely before painting on them.You can paint on any sheets or comforters that you want, but the paint will adhere better to higher thread counts since there\u2019s more fabric. Running the sheets through the hottest cycles will pre-shrink them before you paint so your designs don\u2019t get distorted if you wash them later on.Warning: Don\u2019t use fabric softener when you wash and dry your sheets since it can affect how the paint adheres to the sheets."

If you want to make your colors darker, combine them with black paint instead.Variation: You may use standard acrylic paints if you want, but they will stiffen up once they dry. If you want to use acrylics and keep them flexible, mix 1 part textile medium with 1 part acrylic paint. The textile medium will bond with the acrylic paint so it doesn\u2019t harden as it dries."

    "Start at the top of the sheet and roll the brayer in long strokes across the sheet.",
    "Overlap each stroke by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) so you can cover the sheet completely.",
    "Reapply paint as it starts to get thin on the brayer so you don\u2019t leave any spotty areas.You can buy a rubber brayer from a craft store or online.",
    "Using a brayer works great if you want to create colored backdrops from your sheets.",
    "Try adding horizontal stripes of color going from a dark black shade to a yellow or orange if you want to paint a sunrise or sunset.",
    "Try fabric spray paint to get light, even coverage on the sheets.",
    "Look for a set of fabric spray paint at your local craft store or online.",
    "Hold the spray paint container about 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) above the sheet and press down on the button to spray it.",
    "Use short bursts of paint as opposed to holding the button down so you can get more even coverage.",
    "If you want the paint to be more concentrated, move the spray paint 2 inches (5.1 cm) closer to the sheet.Avoid using regular spray paint since it can cause the sheet to stiffen after it dries.",
    "Fabric spray paint works great for filling in stencils or making ombre patterns for backdrops.",
    "Wet the fabric with a spray bottle to give the paints a watercolor effect.",
    "Mist the sheet with clean water until it\u2019s slightly damp to the touch.",
    "Dip your paintbrush in the paint and spread it over the wet section of the sheet.",
    "The paint will look more transparent and move around on the fabric surface easier to create a painterly look for your design.Sprinkle salt on the paint while it\u2019s still wet to add interesting textures to your design.",
    "The salt will absorb some of the water and leave cloudy patterns of paint.",
    "Try making clouds on a blue backdrop if you want something that feels relaxing.",
    "Use a variety of colors and paint them in random sizes and shapes to make an abstract design.",
    "Create a splatter effect by flicking the paint off of a toothbrush.",
    "Get a toothbrush with stiff bristles and dip them in the paint color you want to apply.",
    "Hold the toothbrush so the bristles face the sheet and flick your wrist forward to splatter the paint.",
    "Keep the toothbrush close to the sheet if you want a tight splatter pattern, or keep it further away for a wider pattern.",
    "Rinse the toothbrush off whenever you change colors.Don\u2019t use the toothbrush for anything other than painting.",
    "This works well if you want to add random designs or accents to your bedsheet.",
    "Soak the sheet in a bucket with water and paint if you want a wrinkled pattern.",
    "Choose a bucket that\u2019s large enough to hold the entire bed sheet and fill it with water.",
    "Put a coin-sized amount of fabric paint in the bucket and stir it to combine it with the water.",
    "Bundle up the sheet and completely submerge it in the water for 2\u20133 hours.",
    "Take the sheet out of the water and wring it out so it can dry.",
    "After about 1 week, unfold the sheets to see the pattern left by the paint.This method works well if you want to make an interesting pattern for a backdrop.",
    "While the sheet soaks in the water, paint will gather in the wrinkles and make them darker.",
    "Caring for Your Sheets Allow the paint to dry for 24 hours.",
    "Leave the sheet undisturbed when you\u2019re finished painting so it has time to dry on the fabric.",
    "Keep the painted section of the sheet flat so the colors don\u2019t run or drip.",
    "After 24 hours, lightly tap the paint with your finger to check that it\u2019s dry to the touch.",
    "If not, leave the paint to dry for another hour before checking again.Check the drying times listed on the paints you used since they may vary.",
    "Hold an iron 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) over the paint to heat-set it.",
    "Heat-setting prevents the textile paints from running or fading when you wash your sheets.",
    "Turn an iron on to medium or high heat and keep it at least 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) over the painted surface.",
    "Move the iron over all of the painted surfaces for about 3\u20135 minutes so the paints bond to the fabric.You don\u2019t have to heat-set pure acrylic paints if you used them.",
    "However, if you mixed textile medium with the acrylics, you still need to.Variation: You can also flip the bed sheet over and iron it on the unpainted side to set it.",
    "Wash your sheets on a gentle cycle to help preserve the color.",
    "Select the gentlest cycle on your washing machine and use detergent and fabric softener as normal.",
    "After the wash, choose a low heat setting on your drier and use the setting labeled \u201cDelicates\u201d or \u201cGentle\u201d to keep the colors intact.If possible, hand-wash the sheets and hang them on a clothesline to dry.",
    "That way you don\u2019t risk ruining them in your machine.",
    "Keep the sheets out of direct sunlight to prevent fading.",
    "Long exposure to sunlight and UV rays can break down the pigments in the paints, so the colors may fade.",
    "Place your sheets away from a window or out of lights so the designs last longer.",
    "If you want to use the sheets outside, like if you were using it as a banner, keep it folded up as often as possible so the sun doesn\u2019t damage the paints.If the colors on your sheets fade, you can always paint over them again."
