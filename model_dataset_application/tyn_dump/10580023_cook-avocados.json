As the oven preheats, grease a rimmed baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray or a little olive oil to prevent the roasted avocado from sticking. Using such a high heat will give your avocados a slightly toasty outside while keeping the inside creamy and flavorful."

Rotate the avocado around the stone so that the knife cuts around the entire edge. Pull the two halves apart and remove the stone from the center. Hit the center of the stone with the blade of the knife so that it sticks in slightly. Rotate the blade to spin and loosen the stone before lifting it out. You can also use a spoon pressed in between the flesh and the stone to scoop the stone out."

Use a spoon or the blade of a knife to cut the flesh of the avocado wedges away from the skin. Skinning the avocados isn\u2019t necessary for roasting them, but you will need to eat around the skin if you leave it on."

Drizzle a little bit of olive oil over each of the avocado slices, and generously sprinkle over some sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add any other herbs and spices you want to flavor your avocado as well. Here are a few suggestions:\nAdd a little paprika, chili powder, and garlic powder to give your roasted avocado a spicy kick. Sprinkle over a little cilantro and add a squeeze of lemon for a hint of freshness. Use a little basil, rosemary, thyme, or oregano to give your avocado an Italian flavor."

After around 15 to 20 minutes, they will develop a toasty brown color around the edges and begin to crisp up slightly. Remove them from the oven and serve immediately. You can eat your roasted avocado by itself fresh from the oven, or add it to a simple salad to turn it into a meal. If you want your avocado wedges to be a little crispier, you can let them cook for up to 25 minutes before taking them out. Keep an eye on them to make sure they don\u2019t burn."
