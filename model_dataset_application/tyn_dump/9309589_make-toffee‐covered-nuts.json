Cool the nuts completely before you serve them. Use caution when handling the hot nuts since the hot sugar can easily burn you. You can store leftover nuts in an airtight container at room temperature. Use the nuts within several weeks or they may become sticky. Making Toffee Pecans Prepare a baking sheet. Get out a large, rimmed baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper on it. Set the sheet aside while you make the pecans. Melt the butter over low heat. Put 1 cup (226 g) of unsalted butter in a large pot on the stove. Turn the heat to low and stir the butter occasionally until it melts. Stir in the sugars, salt, and vanilla. Turn the heat up to medium-low and stir in 1/2 cup (100 g) of light brown sugar, 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon (18 g) of coarse kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract.

Stir and cook the pecans for five to seven minutes. Keep stirring and cooking the nuts until the sugar caramelizes. The pecans should become dark brown. This should take five to seven minutes. Spread the pecans on the sheet. Carefully scoop the toffee pecans onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a fork or spoon to separate the nuts so they don't stick together as they cool. Cool and serve the nuts. Let the pecans cool completely before you remove them from the baking sheet. Serve them or store them in an airtight container. You can keep them at room temperature for three to five days. Making Toffee-Coated Peanuts Preheat the oven and prepare a baking dish. Turn on the oven to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C). Get out a 10 x 15-inch (25 x 38-cm) baking dish and coat the bottom with a little vegetable oil or cooking spray. Set the pan aside. Stir together the toffee mixture.
