  "text":" Choosing Drywall Repair Supplies Purchase a joint compound. The two commonly available joint compounds are lightweight and all-purpose.

Joint compound comes in a variety of container sizes, but be advised that smaller containers may cost just as much as the larger ones. If resealed properly, joint compound can be kept for up to 9 months for other around-the-house repairs if you end up with leftover compound. Get compound applicators and sanders. A joint knife and a metal straightedge will enable you to apply the joint compound smoothly and scrape away the excess, so the repair job will look professional instead of lumpy or uneven.

Get paint and primer. The final step to repairing drywall is painting the repaired area so that it matches the rest of the wall. Use the same primer and paint you originally used to paint the wall.
