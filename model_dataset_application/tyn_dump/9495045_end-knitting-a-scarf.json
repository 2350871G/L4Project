  "text":" Binding Off a Scarf Finish your last row of stitches. Complete the last row of knitting for your scarf before you begin binding off. Then, turn your work around to begin a new row. Switch the needle with all of the stitches on it into your left hand and hold the empty needle with your right hand. Knit the first 2 stitches. Knit the first 2 stitches of your new row as you normally would. Do not knit more than 2 stitches. Lift the first loop over the second loop. Use your left needle to lift the first stitch on your right needle up and over the second stitch on the right hand needle. Allow the first stitch to slip off of the end of the right hand needle. Knit 1 stitch. Only knit 1 new stitch. Lift the first loop over the second loop again. Take your left hand needle again and use it to lift the first stitch on your needle up and over the second stitch. Then, let the stitch you lifted up and over slide off of the end of the right hand needle. Repeat the bind off sequence to the end of the row. Continue to repeat the process of knitting 1 stitch and lifting a stitch up and over the new stitch all the way to the end of the row. You will notice that your finished scarf edge will continue to get longer as you bind off the stitches. Tie off the last stitch. When you have worked all of the stitches on your left hand needle and have only 1 stitch left on your right hand needle, pull the yarn on this stitch to lengthen the loop. Cut the loop in the center so that you have a long strand leftover. Then, tug on this strand to tighten it and finish the bind off. Make sure to leave the strand about 8 inches (20 cm) or longer to ensure that you will be able to weave it into the edges. Weaving in Loose Yarn Strands Thread a yarn needle with the strand. After you finish binding off, you will need to weave in any loose ends of yarn. Take the loose strand of yarn that you want to weave into the edge of your scarf, and then thread it through the eye of your yarn needle. Hold the strand near the eye of the needle with your thumb and index finger to ensure that it stays put while you sew. Insert the needle into a nearby stitch. Locate a nearby stitch to weave the yarn into and then insert the yarn needle through that stitch. Then, insert the needle into the next stitch from the opposite side of the scarf.

When you can no longer weave the yarn in and out of a stitch, pull the end of the strand out of the eye of the yarn needle. Then, tie the end of the yarn strand through the last stitch that you wove it through to secure it. Cut the excess yarn about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the stitch. Adding Fringe Choose the yarn for fringe. Adding fringe is a decorative way to end knitting a scarf. You can add fringe in the same color you used to knit your project, or you can use different colors of yarn. Opt for a texture that is similar to the texture of your yarn. For example, if your scarf is made from a medium worsted weight wool yarn, then choose the same type of yarn for your fringe. Cut a piece of cardboard that is the same length as the fringe you want to make. Wrapping the yarn around cardboard will help to ensure that all of your fringe is the same length.

Keep in mind that the yarn strands will be twice as long as you want them to be, but this is because you will be doubling them up along the edge of your scarf. Gather the yarn into bundles of 2, 3, or 4 strands. Divide the yarn into bundles of 3 to 4 strands, depending how thick you want the tassles to be. Keep the bundles separate from each other so that it will be easy to grab them as you work. Use a crochet hook to pull the middle of the strands through a stitch. Grab a bundle and fold it in half.

Only trim off enough yarn to even out the ends of the fringe.",
