  "text":" Getting Started Choose a plain bench that you want to modify. Simple benches with straight edges rather than curved would work best for this.

Even though you will be covering it, you still want to clean it. Any dirt and grim may prevent the adhesive from sticking properly. Wipe the entire bench down with a damp cloth first, then dry it with a clean towel. Wipe the bench down a final time with rubbing alcohol. This will remove any residual oils. Don't worry if the rubbing alcohol removes some of the original paint. You will be covering the bench with cork, so it won't be noticeable in the end. Paint the legs, if desired. You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to add a fresh look to your bench. Remove the legs first, if possible, then paint them using spray paint. Set them aside so that they can dry while you complete the rest of the bench. If you can't remove the legs, it might be easier to paint them with a paintbrush instead. Paint the underside of the bench, if desired. You won't be covering the underside of the bench with cork, but it may still be visible from certain angles.
