If it's too late for that, put the bowl into the freezer now, and the ice cream base in the fridge. Leave them there over night, then continue the next day. Assemble the ice cream maker. Take the bowl out of the freezer and place it into the ice cream maker. Insert the beater, then plug the ice cream maker in.
