Once the trench is dug, you should be able to locate the bamboo rhizomes growing horizontally under the ground. The rhizomes will look like the main stalk of bamboo growing out of the ground. Dig a couple of inches (cm) deeper if you don\u2019t find any rhizomes."

Cut through all the rhizomes in two places with a pointed shovel and remove the separated sections. If you\u2019d like to contain the bamboo to just a specific part of the yard, sever the rhizomes growing outside of the desired bamboo area. You can also try using a saw to cut thicker bamboo shoots and rhizomes. However, you'll have to dig out the soil all the way around the rhizome in order to get clear access to it with the saw."

Running bamboo rhizomes can grow 3\u20135 feet (0.91\u20131.52 m) per year and must be cut at least twice annually to control. Clumping bamboo rhizomes are less invasive than running bamboo and will only grow 1\u20133 feet (0.30\u20130.91 m) per year. This type of bamboo should be cut annually."
