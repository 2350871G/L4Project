Coating the pan is especially important if the Bundt pan has intricate details and places where cake could stick."

          "description":"Take 1/4 cup (55 g) of finely ground pecans or pecan meal and sprinkle it over the inside of your greased Bundt pan. Turn and shake the pan so the pecans coat the pan evenly. The pecans will add a slight crunch to the cake and will give it a nice golden color. Set the pan aside while you make the cake batter. You can purchase ground pecan meal or make your own. Just process the whole, toasted pecans until they are ground into a powder."

Beat the cake batter for another minute on low speed. The butter rum flavor is optional. Consider adding it for a robust flavor. Keep in mind that butter rum flavoring doesn't actually contain any rum."

Take the cake out of the oven, but leave it in the pan while you make the syrup. You'll also pour the light rum sauce over the cake while it's still in the pan."

You'll need 1/2 cup (115 g) of unsalted butter, 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water, 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of light rum. You can use salted butter.

The skewer should come out cleanly after poking the holes into the cake. If cake batter comes out with the skewer, the cake needs to cook longer."

Continue pouring the sauce over in 1/4-cup (60 ml) increments until all of the sauce is on the cake. Don't worry if the sauce goes onto the cake, instead of just in the holes.

Keep the cake at room temperature. When you're ready to serve the cake, run a knife around the edges of the cake and the pan. Flip the cake onto your cake pan and slice it. If the cake is sticking to the pan, you can place it in a warm oven (350 degrees F or 175 C) for 5 to 10 minutes. This will liquefy the syrup so you can easily flip the cake out."
