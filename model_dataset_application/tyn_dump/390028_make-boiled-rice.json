Place 1 cup (195 g) medium- or long-grain white rice in a strainer, and rinse it under cold running water. Rinsing the rice isn\u2019t always necessary. Some rice may have more starch on it than others, though, so you may just want to get in the habit of doing it with every batch that you boil."

However, make sure that you don\u2019t cook it so long that it becomes gummy. Don\u2019t take the lid off the pot before the 18 minute mark. It helps trap steam that aids in the cooking process, so if you remove the lid, it may take longer for the rice to finish.
