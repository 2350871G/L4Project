When you are done using the glue, wash the paintbrush and close the jar tightly. If you want your project to be super sparkly, wait until the glue dries before adding a second layer. Keep adding layers (and letting them dry in between) until you get the sparkly you desire. If you are using very light glitter, such as pale pink or white, consider painting your project with acrylic paint first. Use the same color of paint as your glitter. Let the paint dry before you add the glitter glue. The glitter may shed, especially if you painted a large area. Wait until the glue dries, then brush on a thin layer of decoupage or Mod Podge. This will seal the glitter in and keep it from shedding."
