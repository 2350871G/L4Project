If you are not using a pattern, then draw and cut your own paper pattern piece to ensure that all of your pocket pieces will be the same size. You can make your pants pockets any size you like, but a 10 by 5 in (25 by 13 cm) rectangle is a good size. If you want to use a pattern, but don\u2019t have one, there are some free pocket patterns available online. If you prefer a curved edge on the bottom of the pockets, then cut out a rectangle and then cut around the corners on 1 side to round them out."

Position the pieces so that the right (print or outer) sides of the pockets and pants are facing each other. As you do this, make sure that the edges of the front and back pieces are lined up. Ensure that the edges of the pants are lined up going from the waistband to the bottom of the pant legs. Line up any notches in the pocket pieces or pants at this time as well. Pin above and below the 2 dots from the paper pattern. These are the dots that indicate the pocket opening.

Continue to keep the stitch about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges all the way down the pants. Repeat this process for the other side of your pants if you are adding 2 pockets. Topstitch along the opening of the pocket. After you finish securing the side seams, turn your pants so that the right sides are facing out and the pocket material is tucked into the inside of the pants. Then, sew a straight stitch along the edge of the pocket about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the edge. Repeat the stitch on both sides of each pocket.
