You can use any type of yarn you like, but a medium-weight yarn is usually best for knitting blankets. Make sure that you check the pattern to find out how much yarn you will need to create your blanket. You will need around 6 balls of yarn to create a twin size zig zag blanket, so divide the number of colors you want to use evenly to get this amount of yarn. For example, if you are using 3 colors, then get 2 or 3 balls of each color. Yarn balls and skeins come in different sizes, so check the yardage to determine how much yarn you will get with each ball or skein."
