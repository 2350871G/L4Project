These ends are especially woody and are generally not very appetizing. You should be able to roughly estimate where the right breaking point is by gently bending the spear a few times near the bottom. The point at which the stalk turns tender will usually be the easiest, most natural breaking point, and you can usually break the bottoms off at this point with your hands."

  "text":" Before You Begin: Preparing the Asparagus Choose fresh asparagus. If using fresh asparagus instead of frozen asparagus, make sure the spears you choose, are firm and bright green.
