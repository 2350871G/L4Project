          "description":"Use a measuring tape to calculate the size of the countertops that you want for your kitchen or bathroom. Measure each length from corner to corner and draw a corresponding line with the measurement on a piece of grid paper. Once you\u2019ve sketched out each side with the corresponding measurements labeled, re-measure your cabinets 2-3 times to make sure that your measurements are accurate. Measure the opening of your sink by flipping it over and measuring the base from edge to edge on each side. If your sink is still in the box, it will list the required space for the opening. If you\u2019ve installed the cabinets yourself, make sure that you have a level line running along the top by placing a level over each individual cabinet and measuring the distance from the floor to the top. Use shingles to raise a cabinet if you need to adjust its height to make them level. Add 1 in (2.5 cm) to each side that will lead to a rounded corner if you aren\u2019t ordering countertops with 90-degree corners."

          "description":"Order your countertop from a manufacturer that produces laminate countertops. Choose a style and color of laminate that you think will look good in your kitchen or bathroom. Keep in mind that lighter colors will be easier to clean. Give the countertop manufacturer your measurements and wait for them to deliver your countertop. If you really want to make sure that the countertop fits perfectly, have the distributor take measurements for you. It may cost you a little more, but it\u2019ll ensure that you get a perfect fit. The distributor will determine how many pieces your countertop will come in. Most of the time, it will arrive as a single piece.Tip: Choose a counter that includes a backsplash if your home is less than 20 years old and your walls are perfectly flat. Get a separate piece for you backsplash if your home is older and your walls have warped a little as the house settled over the years."

Set it down slowly and evenly so that you don\u2019t damage your cabinets. Slide it by lifting it a little and repositioning it until it\u2019s in place to ensure that it fits. If it doesn\u2019t fit, measure it and double-check your original measurements to ensure that the manufacturer didn\u2019t make a mistake.

This will tell you the distance that you need to install your pilot holes from the cabinets. Once you have the measurement from the screw opening to the side of the bracket, measure and mark the locations of your screws under the cabinet. Custom-sized counters often come with the pilot holes, brackets, and screws to install it. You can skip the corresponding steps if this is the case. Corner brackets are sometimes called L brackets. They\u2019re L-shaped or triangle-shaped brackets with flat sides and they\u2019re used to attach flat surfaces that are perpendicular."

Drill pilot holes where you marked your screws with a carpentry pencil. Use a soft drill bit in the countertop to make the screws fit perfectly.Tip: The size of your pilot holes depends on the size of your screws, which is dependent upon the thickness of your countertop. For a standard countertop with a 1.75 in (4.4 cm) thickness, drill a \u204464 inch (0.20 cm) pilot hole. Place your brackets so that they rest squarely in the corner where your counter meets the cabinets. If your cabinet comes with pre-fitted slots for your screws, you do not need to drill pilot holes.

Repeat this process for each bracket. Before you drill, hold the bottom of a screw flush against the side of your countertop to make sure that you aren\u2019t going to drill through the countertop completely.

Place the bottom edge carefully in the corner where the counter meets the wall. Slide it up against the wall and press down towards the corner. When you\u2019re done, use a caulk gun and silicone caulk to fill in the gaps around the edges of your countertops and backsplash.

Cover the backside of your backsplash as well if it\u2019s preinstalled on your counter. Slide the countertops as needed to fit them perfectly on your cabinets. Look underneath your counter to see if you successfully lined it up with the tops of your cabinets. If you didn\u2019t, slide it while it\u2019s still on top of the cabinet so that the glue lines up with the wood. Once it\u2019s lined up, push it against the wall so that the backsplash or edge is flush.Warning: Don\u2019t take your time while lining it up. The construction adhesive and silicone will dry if you leave it alone for more than a few minutes. Hammer a block of wood along sections where the cabinets meet the countertop. Take a thick block of wood and place it on top of a section where your cabinet meets the countertop. Hold it along the side with your nondominant hand and hammer it down. This will press out any air pockets and affix your countertop tightly along the cabinet edge. Repeat this process for each area where your cabinet meets the counter. You can use a rubber mallet instead of a hammer if you\u2019re really worried about damaging your countertops. Let your countertop air dry for 24 hours before using it.",
