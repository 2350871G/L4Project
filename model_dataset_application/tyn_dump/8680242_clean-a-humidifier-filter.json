Drain the old water out of the tank and set it aside. It may be a good idea to lay the water tank in the sink or on a folded towel in case it continues draining after you\u2019ve emptied it.

Look over the filter to see what level of cleaning it will require. Filters that are mildly dusty can be rinsed clean. If there\u2019s mold or an excessive amount of mineral buildup present, you may need to use a vinegar or bleach-based cleaning solution instead. Disposable paper filters can simply be thrown away and replaced."

Lightly brush away stuck-on debris with a soft-bristled brush or fingertip, but be careful not to apply too much pressure to the mesh. Once the filter looks clean, shake off the excess water. You should only ever use fresh water to rinse your humidifier filter."

Attempting to speed the drying process along using another tool, such as a hair dryer, may cause permanent damage. Set the filter on an absorbent towel and check back in 1-2 hours. Mold needs moisture to thrive. Reloading your humidifier with clean water and a dry filter will prevent mold from returning. Once the filter is dry, you can reassemble and start using the humidifier again."
