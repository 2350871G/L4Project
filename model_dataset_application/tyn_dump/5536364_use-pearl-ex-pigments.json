          "headline":"Mix together Pearl Ex and embossing powder.",
          "description":"Combine one part Pearl Ex pigment with two parts clear embossing powder, mixing them together in a small bowl with a plastic spoon until evenly blended. The exact amount of embossing powder you need will vary depending on how dramatic you want the effect to be and how thin the paper is. More absorbent paper requires a greater amount of embossing powder. For use with an average sized stamp and heavy cardstock, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) Pearl Ex pigment and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) clear embossing powder should be sufficient."

          "headline":"Stamp the desired image on your paper.",
          "description":"Load a stamp with clear embossing liquid and press the stamp firmly onto a heavy sheet of paper. cardstock and other heavy-weight papers work better than light papers do. Make sure that the surface you want to emboss faces up as you stamp it. Alternatively, you could spread the clear embossing fluid on a stamp pad instead of applying it directly to the stamp itself. Load the stamp with the treated ink of the pad before stamping it onto the paper. After stamping the image, thoroughly clean away all of the embossing fluid from the stamp. If the embossing fluid is left on the stamp, it can harden and ruin the rubber."

          "headline":"Sprinkle the tinted powder over the stamp.",
          "description":"Gently sprinkle the enhanced embossing powder over the stamped design. Make sure that the entire design has been covered by the powder. Lift the paper and carefully tip it upside-down so that the majority of excess powder will fall off. Gently tap the back of the paper to encourage the excess powder to drop."

          "headline":"Heat the area with a heat gun.",
          "description":"Pass a heat gun over the entire design. Continue heating the area until the lines of the design lift above the surface of the paper. Hold the heat gun 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) away from the surface of the paper and move it around continuously as you apply the heat. Using too much concentrated heat can result in scorch marks, so you need to work carefully during this step."

          "description":"Use tissue paper, tracing paper, coffee filters, or another patch of soft paper to wipe away any excess Pearl Ex powder. Once the excess has been removed, the project is complete. Allow the area to cool and set for one to two minutes before brushing away any excess powder. If soft paper is not available, you could brush away the excess with a soft-bristled paintbrush."

          "description":"Grab a piece of white polymer clay large enough for your intended project. Knead it in your hands for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it becomes more flexible. You can also experiment by mixing Pearl Ex pigment into pre-colored clay to produce different shades. For instance, you can add a glittery pink Pearl Ex pigment to a matte pink clay to give the clay a sparkle effect."

          "headline":"Form the clay as desired.",
          "description":"Use any standard molding method to sculpt the tinted polymer clay into the pieces you wish to make. Polymer clay can be used to form a variety of pieces, including small sculptures, beads, pendants, ornaments, and containers, among other things. You can form polymer clay free-handed, or you can use a variety of tools and molds to help you create shapes. If desired, you can also apply Pearl Ex pigment directly to a polymer clay mold by brushing it on with a soft-bristled paintbrush. Turn the mold over and lightly tap the back to dump any excess before pressing the clay into the mold. This will result in a more vibrant shade, and the pigment also makes it easier to release the clay from the mold."

        {
          "headline":"Brush on additional color as needed.",
          "description":"If you want to create a bolder shade of pigment on part of the piece, you can do so by dusting Pearl Ex pigment directly over the area with a paintbrush or cotton swab. Press the pigment into the clay with just enough force to make it stick. The best way to do this is by gently rubbing it in with your ring finger. You need to apply a gentle amount of pressure to avoid damaging the shape of the clay as you work."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bake the clay.",
          "description":"Place the clay on your prepared baking sheet and place the baking sheet in the oven. Allow the clay to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until hardened. As with the baking temperature, the baking/curing time can vary based on the brand of clay you use. Check the instructions before proceeding."

        {
          "headline":"Coat with varnish.",
          "description":"After the clay cools, brush or spray clear varnish over the surface to seal in the surface pigment. Once the varnish dries, the piece is finished. Note that varnish is only necessary if you coated the surface with Pearl Ex pigment. Pigment that has been kneaded into the clay will remain in place even without varnish, but clear varnish can still be used to give the piece a glossy sheen. For best results, spray the varnish out over the surface and allow the mist to fall onto it from above. Spraying the varnish directly onto the surface can cause the powder to blow away and may also result in uneven coats or spray marks. Liquid varnish can be applied directly to the surface with a paintbrush. Use a sponge brush if you want to avoid the risk of brush stroke lines."

Tape this scrap paper to the stencil to prevent it from falling off.

Always apply spray adhesive in a well-ventilated area. Alternatively, you could apply standard PVA (white) glue to the paper using a paintbrush.
