Make sure that you\u2019re firmly holding your plastic in your non-dominant hand and cut carefully, using a flat surface to brace your plastic. Never cut directly next the hand you\u2019re holding the plastic material in. You can mark the locations that you want to cut with a permanent marker. You can also use a dry erase marker if you want to wipe the marks away when you\u2019re done."

Mark the line where you want to cut with a dry erase or permanent marker. Make an initial incision along your marked line by poking into it at a 45-degree angle. Holding the utility knife firmly in your dominant hand, drag your wrist along the area that you wish to cut. You can also use a box cutter if you don\u2019t have an utility knife."

          "headline":"Apply friction with some sewing thread to cut harder plastics.",
          "description":"Surprisingly, you can actually cut through plastic with some strong sewing thread. To do this, secure your plastic to a firm surface with some standard clamps or tape. Wrap a long line of sewing thread around each hand to secure it. Then, wrap the thread around the section that you want to cut and pull the thread back and forth in rapid and short movements. The pressure and friction from the thread will heat the plastic and you\u2019ll be able to snap it right off! This method is best used for removing smaller pieces of plastic from a larger item. To wrap sewing thread around your hands, twist the thread between your thumb and forefinger and rotate your wrists inward to create tension. The movement of your thread should be quick, and you should apply a light degree of pressure as you\u2019re pulling on it."
