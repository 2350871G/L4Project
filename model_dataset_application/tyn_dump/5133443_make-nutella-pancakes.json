  "text":" Making Nutella Syrup for Pancakes Combine the Nutella and the heavy cream in a small saucepan. Stir them together with a whisk. Don't worry if the Nutella doesn't dissolve right away. Use more heavy cream for a thinner sauce, and less heavy cream for a thicker one. Cook the sauce over low heat, stirring constantly. As the sauce warms, the Nutella will blend with the heavy cream. It is ready when the color is even and the texture is smooth. Allow the sauce to cool before storing it. Once it reaches room temperature, you can pour it into a jar or container, and store it in the fridge. You can also pour it into a mini pitcher used for pouring sauces and cream. Use the sauce. Pour it over your pancakes instead of syrup. You can also use it on top of other breakfast foods, such as toast or waffles. Pair it with strawberries or strawberry jam for the ultimate treat! Store the sauce in the fridge and use it within 7 days. Making Nutella Stuffed Pancakes Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. If you don't have any parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead.
