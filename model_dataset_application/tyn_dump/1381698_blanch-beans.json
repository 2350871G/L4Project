If you are only blanching a handful or two of beans, you do not need to measure precisely. Optionally, add salt to the water for flavor. Leave enough space in the pot to fit the beans.

The water will work best if it is 60\u00baF (15.5\u00baC) or below, in order to rapidly cool the beans before they begin to lose nutrients and flavor. Ice is recommended to keep this water cold. If you are blanching a large quantity of beans, use approximately equal amounts of ice and beans by weight. If the cold tap water from your sink stings or numbs your hand, it is cold enough to use. This water will warm to room temperature quickly, however, so if you are not using ice you may wish to fill the water bowl toward the end of the boiling process. Replace the water frequently to keep it cold if you are blanching more than one pot of beans."

Other types of bean, including lima, butter, and pinto beans, will require 2 to 4 minutes depending on size. The beans will taste cooked but still crisp when they are done blanching. If the water takes more than 60 seconds to return to a boil, you may be using too much water. Reduce the amount of water next time to avoid losing flavor and nutrients. If you have a blanching or steaming basket, you may place the beans inside it and lower it into the water.
