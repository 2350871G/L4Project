The stencil kit likely comes with a stencil for the mug body, base, and handle. Use a rolling pin to flatten the clay, and roll it out until it is about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick. Then, lay your stencils over top of the clay, and cut out the pieces using a knife or blade. To assemble the mug, place the bottom of the mug on a flat surface, and stand the body of the mug up along a long side. Wrap the body around the bottom, and use your fingers to smooth out the clay. Scratch the edges with a fork, and wet your clay to fuse together both sides. Do this to attach your handle as well. Finally, bake your mug at  325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes. Typically, the body of the mug is about 8.5 in \u00d7 3 in (21.6 cm \u00d7 7.6 cm)."
