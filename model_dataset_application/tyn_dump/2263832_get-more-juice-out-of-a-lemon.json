          "description":"To get the maximum amount of juice from your lemon, freeze it before juicing. After freezing solid, take it out and let it thaw for 4-8 hours, until the rind reaches room temperature. When you heat it afterwards, the frozen juice will expand in the membrane of the fruit and break down. This will make the juicing process more efficient and give you the most juice possible. It\u2019s actually a lot harder to juice a lemon when it\u2019s cold or at room temperature. Heating the lemon before cutting it is the best way to juice your fruit."

          "description":"Place the lemon onto a paper towel or plate. Set the lemon in the center of a microwave. Heat the lemon on medium power for 10-20 seconds. This is faster than soaking the lemon in warm water, but it\u2019s a little riskier. If there are any tiny holes in the lemon\u2019s rind, you\u2019ll end up evaporating some of the juice. If your lemon is at room temperature, heat it for 10 seconds. If it was in the refrigerator, microwave it for 20 seconds."

Let the lemon soak for 30-40 minutes, replacing the water once every 10 minutes to ensure that it stays warm. This is more time-consuming than microwaving your lemon, but you won\u2019t cause any of the juice to evaporate."

          "description":"Before you cut your lemon, roll it around on your countertop or cutting board. Set the lemon down so that it lays on its side. Place your palm on top and press down with moderate pressure. Then, roll the lemon back and forth between your palm and the hard surface. Do this for 30-45 seconds to soften the membrane inside the lemon.Tip: If your lemon is on the harder side, you can use a rolling pin to compress it by rolling the pin over the lemon while pushing down."

Puncture the lemon with the blade of your knife and remove your nondominant hand to get it out of the way. Press all the way through the center to cut it in half.Tip: If you want to avoid a mess, this is the best place to stop. You can cut each section in half again if you want to divide the lemon further, though. The idea here is to expose as much of the membrane as possible. When people cut a lemon horizontally, they end up trapping a lot of the juice near the stems."

Carve through the rind by moving your knife back and forth between the skin and the membrane. Repeat this process by rotating the lemon to remove the skin. Peeling your lemon is a little messy, but it\u2019s the only way to access the juice from every part of the lemon. Always cut away from your nondominant hand as you brace the lemon. If your lemon is too small or your hands are too big, you can hold it in place by gripping it with tongs."

Squeeze hard to remove the majority of the juice. With slices, hold the opposite ends between your index finger and thumb. Squeeze your fingers together to remove most of the juice.Tip: You can use a pair of tongs to squeeze your lemon and apply pressure while keeping your hands clean if you prefer. Place a strainer over your bowl if you don\u2019t want any of the membrane to end up in the juice. If your bowl is too small, you\u2019ll end up sending lemon juice all over the place.

Poke each section 5-10 times to break the membrane apart. Then, squeeze the lemon again to extract even more juice. You can use a knife instead of a fork if you\u2019d like.
