          "description":"Before you start, have everything ready. Sponge cakes are time sensitive cakes, so you don't want to measure ingredients or wait on the oven to heat while you're in the middle of mixing. Measure all the ingredients and have them nearby before you begin. Sift the baking powder into the flour before you begin. Set aside until needed. Preheat the oven to 375\u00baF (190\u00b0C.) Line the pan with butter before beginning. As an alternative to butter or cooking spray, use parchment paper. Parchment paper is a grease and moisture-resistant paper. When using parchment paper, no butter or cooking sprays are needed because cakes, cookies, or other baked goods won't stick. It also helps with clean up, since you will have no leftover batter to wash. If using parchment paper, cut a piece of paper into the shape and size of the bottom of the pan. You can also line the sides of the pan with paper, or you can use cooking spray or butter."

Place the yolk in the other bowl. Try other egg separating methods here: 6 Ways To Separate An Egg. This should be done half an hour before you begin mixing. The eggs are easier to separate when they are cold because both parts seem to hold their shape better. Leave the eggs out for half an hour so they can warm to room temperature before starting the recipe. Make sure your hands are clean and all soap and oil have been removed.

Next, beat in the vanilla extract, water, and lemon zest. Zest is the flavorful outer part of the rind of citrus fruit, such as lemons, oranges, and limes. On a lemon, this is the yellow part; on an orange, this is the orange part of the rind. To zest, use a lemon zester, lemon (or cheese) grater, a vegetable peeler, or a small knife.

    "Sift the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl.",
    "This aerates the flour.",
    "Lift the sifter up high to make sure the flour is extremely airy.",
    "Cream the butter and sugar.",
    "In a separate mixing bowl, combine the butter and sugar.",
    "Creaming butter and sugar is a type of mixing method.",
    "Start with room temperature butter.",
    "Using an electric mixer, beat the butter on low until it is creamy.",
    "Add the sugar, and mix on high.",
    "Cream until the color is pale, and the mixture is fluffy.",
    "Don't forget to scrape the sides of the bowl while mixing.",
    "To make your butter room temperature, take out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you begin.",
    "Room temperature butter should be soft, but not melted.",
    "Beat in the eggs.",
    "Gradually beat the eggs into the butter and sugar mixture.",

    "If you do not have an electric hand whisk, you can fold in the flour.",
    "Cut the spatula into the mixture, and then lift the batter over the top.",
    "Turn the bowl a quarter of a turn and repeat.",
    "This method gently mixes in the flour without losing the air.",
    "Pour batter into a cake pan.",
    "Bake for 25-30 minutes.",
    "Check to see if the cake is done by inserting a toothpick or fork into the middle.",
    "If it comes out clean, the cake is done.",
    "If you want to add a layer of fruit, jam, or frosting, divide the recipe into two identical pans to make a layered cake.",
    "Let cool.",
    "After you remove the cake from the oven, let it stand for a few minutes.",
    "Use a knife to loosen the edges of the cake from the sides of the pan.",
