The temperature can drop below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) for short amounts of time, but try to avoid exposing it to regular drops in temperature lower than 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). Ficus benjamina can be grown in USDA hardiness zones 9 and above. A ficus can be grown outdoors as long as there is no risk of frost in your climate."

An area with bright, indirect sunlight is the best place to keep a ficus. Ficuses do not tolerate being moved once they have settled in a location. Even a slight change in the climate or location can cause leaves to drop."

To maintain humidity, place a saucer with \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) of room temperature water underneath the ficus's pot. The water will evaporate and increase the humidity. Refill the saucer when water is fully evaporated. Keep a humidifier in the room to raise the humidity. Misting the leaves during the summer months will also help increase the humidity around your plant."

Pour just enough water into the pot to seep through the drainage holes at the bottom. If the leaves fold easily, you may have overwatered your ficus. If the leaves are crinkly to the touch, they may be under-watered. Water less in the winter since there is less sun and temperatures are colder."

If you want to, you can use a dry cloth to wipe the mist off the leaves to fully remove any dirt or dust. Mist the leaves every couple of days as the water evaporates. Leaving the mist on during the summer months will help control and maintain the humidity around your ficus."

If you notice any bugs on your tree, mix the soap with water in a spray bottle and thoroughly spray your ficus. Spray both the tops and bottoms of the leaves so you get full coverage of the area. If the insecticidal soap does not work, try using neem oil or other essential oils to deter or kill the bugs . In a case of severe infestation, it may be best just to throw away your plant."

Use pruning shears to cut off full branches where leaves are yellowing. Step away from your ficus often so you can see how you're shaping it. Do not remove more than \u2153 of the growth from the plant. The sap is irritating to the skin, so wear gloves as you prune."
