This higher pressure on your gauges is a great indicator of when its time to clean the filters. There are cases when the pressure won\u2019t increase even though the filter is dirty, such as if there is a hole in the filter that water can easily flow through. However, in most cases, high pressure is a good sign that your filter needs cleaning. Unless your pool gets very dirty, very often, this should only occur once or twice a year."

Then locate the water supply disconnect and turn it to the off position as well. Turning these off before you remove your filter will ensure that water will drain from the filter compartment and that there will be no risk of shock while you are cleaning out your filter."

Releasing this valve will allow the water to drain from the filter compartment before you take the lid off. You will know that you have successfully released the valve when you hear pressurized air coming out of it. In most cases, you will turn the valve counterclockwise until it won\u2019t move any more to release the pressure in the system."

There are a variety of types of clamps that may be used on your filtration system. Follow the instructions that came with the system to properly detach the lid of the filter compartment if it is unclear to you.Warning: Between the top and bottom sections of the filter compartment will be a seal gasket.

    "Seal the bucket you soak the filters in when not in use so you won't have to add additional chemicals each time you clean filters.",
    "Some sediment will accumulate in the bottom of this bucket, but it doesn't affect the usability of the solution.",
    "Using Acid to Dissolve Minerals Embedded in the Filter Put on personal protective equipment before using muriatic acid.",
    "The acid you use to clean the filter can be dangerous, especially before it is diluted.",
    "If you don't use proper protective equipment it can burn your skin and the fumes can damage your lungs.",
    "Before using it, put on gloves that are made for dealing with chemicals.",
    "Also put on a respirator and eye protection, so that if the acid splashes it won't get in your eyes.",
    "Muriatic acid is similar to hydrochloric acid.",
    "It can dissolve many plastics and metals, as well as skin.",
    "Mix a solution of muriatic acid and water.",
    "This mixture is used to dissolve minerals that accumulate in the filter media.",
    "Use another clean bucket with a lid that seals tightly.",
    "Add about 2/3 of a bucket of clean water, then carefully pour in enough muriatic acid to give you a 1 part acid to 20 parts water solution.",
    "In a typical 5 gallon bucket, this means about 6 gallons of water to 1 1/2 quarts acid.",
    "Using a 5% muriatic acid solution to remove calcium deposited in the filter media will increase the filter's performance if high concentrations of minerals exist in your pool water.",
    "Too many minerals in the filter reduces the rate that water can pass through the filter.",
    "This makes the filtration system work harder than it should have to.",
    "Soak the filters in the acid solution until it quits bubbling.",
    "The bubbles are an indication the acid is reacting with the mineral deposits, and when the bubbling has quit, the minerals should be dissolved.",
    "This usually takes about 10 minutes.",
    "Spray the acid-cleaned filters with a hose.",
    "Use plenty of fresh water to remove all of the minerals that have been loosened by the acid.",
    "Once they are clean, allow them to dry before putting them back in your filtration system.",
    "Shake any remaining collected dirt from the pleats, and they are ready either to proceed to chlorine soaking, or if this step has followed the chlorine soaking, they are ready for reuse in your pool.",
    "Seal the acid container when you are finished with it.",
    "If you keep your container sealed tightly, the acid will not weaken.",
    "This means it may be reused repeatedly for filter cleanings.",
    "Store the container in an out of the way place where there is no chance of it getting knocked over or opened by a child.",
    ".",
    "Allowing the containers to remain open will allow the water to evaporate out of your solution, rendering it overly strong in a short time."
