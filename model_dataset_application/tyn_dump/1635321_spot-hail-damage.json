      "description":"The 3 major signs of hail damage include bruising, cracking and granules missing from asphalt. Check for missing pieces in the asphalt of the roof. Look for areas on the shingle that have exposed, black substrate. This means the granules of the asphalt have been compromised or knocked off by something. Search for bruising in the shingles. Dents from hail are not always completely visible. Run your hand over the shingle to feel for small dimples in the surface. Press 1 of the dimples to see if it has any give. If it does, this is a sign that the shingle has begun some deterioration. Look for cracking in the shingle. Large hail can make a circular crack if the hail hits it hard enough."
