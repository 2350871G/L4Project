Perlite can be found at gardening centers for a cheaper price than at hardware stores. The perlite and cement will take anywhere from 2-7 days to dry, depending on the climate.

The more you compactly you crush the cans, the more easily they will melt.Warning: Make sure you melt the aluminum outside. Melting aluminum can cause fumes and fires, so it's important to be in a well-ventilated, optimally outdoor space. No matter whether or not you clean the cans, there will be a layer of impurities like paint on top of the melted aluminum, called dross. This can be scraped off and disposed of. Fill a large glass bowl with sand. The sand will insulate the bowl and the ground from the heat of the torch. It will also keep the melting chamber in place. If you can find one, a steel bucket is even better for melting aluminum. Place a smaller steel cup in the center of the sand-filled bowl. The steel cup needs to be at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter to melt cans.

Once the metal cools down, you can remove it from the muffin tin and store it. You can also pour the melted aluminum into a steel mold, if you have one handy. Never handle any materials that are still hot. Creating a Aluminum Foundry Surround a pipe with perlite and cement inside a 6 gallon (23 L) steel pail. Use a 8 in (20 cm) pipe cut down to about the same height as the bucket and a 60% perlite, 40% Portland cement mix. Fill the bottom 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the bucket without the pipe inside. Then, once the mixture dries, place the pipe on top and fill the rest of the bucket around the outside of the pipe with the same mixture. This will be the mold for the melting chamber. It's important to use steel to make a homemade foundry because it won't melt in the extreme temperatures you'll use.

Alternatively, you can use sand and plaster of Paris to surround the pipe, which will harden in around 1 hour. Create a lid for the foundry. Pour the same mixture of perlite and Portland cement (or plaster of Paris) onto the lid of the bucket. To create handles, stand up two 4 in (10 cm) U-bolts in the mixture, placing the ends with the nuts down in the mix. Wait until the mixture has dried, then slide it out of the lid. Drill hole in the top of the lid using an electric drill and a 3 in (7.6 cm) hole cutting saw. If your bucket didn't come with a lid, use a second bucket to create the lid. Fill it to around 2 inches (5.1 cm) with the mixture. Remove the inner pipe and drill a hole in the foundry for air supply. Remove the pipe from the foundry. You may need to use a pair of pliers. Then, drill a hole 1 3/8 inch (3.5 cm) in diameter about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the top of the bucket. Use a 1 3/8 inch (3.5 cm) hole saw connected to an electric drill to cut a hole into the bucket. Once you have cut through the bucket, position the blade at a 30-degree angle and drill. Look for a drill that is specifically made for cutting through metal.

Alternatively, you can duct tape the hair dryer to a PVC pipe coupling, which you can slide onto the PVC pipe. This will make it easier to remove the hair dryer.
