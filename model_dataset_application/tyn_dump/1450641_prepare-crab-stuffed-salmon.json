The length should be about the size of your hand. If you purchase 1 large steak, you can cut it in half to produce 2 proportional serving sizes."

Whisk 1 egg in a separate bowl. Add mustard and whip to combine it with the egg. Add this to the crab meat bowl. Grate approximately 4 tbsp (56.7 g) of frozen Brie into the bowl. Toss in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14.3 g) of pine nuts. Set the stuffing mixture into the refrigerator until the salmon is ready."

Set each steak onto the baking sheet with the skin side facing upward. Bake the salmon for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks. The meat is done when the steaks have turned an opaque pink hue. Flip the salmon and grate the rest of the Brie on top. Place in the broiler until the cheese browns, about 4 minutes."
