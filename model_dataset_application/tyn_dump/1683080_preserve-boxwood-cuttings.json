Keep in mind that you can preserve many cuttings at once, so don\u2019t be afraid to select multiple branches. Continue to sever the branches off your boxwood plant until you have enough to complete your project. For the best results, you should treat high-quality cuttings as soon as they have been cut. Keep in mind that the treatment will not hide discoloration or dried leaves. If you\u2019re using the cuttings for a project, you can adjust the size after they\u2019ve been preserved.
