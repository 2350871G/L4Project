          "description":"Add 1 cup (200 g) of softened butter, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of vanilla sugar, a pinch of salt, and 1 egg yolk to a large bowl. Use a hand mixer to beat the ingredients together until they\u2019re fully combined, which should take 30 seconds to 1 minute. You can use a stand mixer to make the dough if you prefer. You can also stir the dough together by hand, but it will require more time and effort. You can purchase vanilla sugar or make your own by combining 2 cups (400 g) of white sugar with 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract in a sealable plastic bag. Mix until the vanilla is evenly distributed throughout the sugar, and spread the sugar out on a cookie sheet. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes or until it\u2019s dry."

Blend it into the butter mixture with the hand mixer until it is just combined. Be careful not to overmix the flour into the dough. You may wind up with tough cookies. You can substitute cake flour for the pastry flour. If you don\u2019t have pastry or cake flour, you can get the same effect by mixing 2 tablespoons (16 g) of cornstarch in with every 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour."
