Look online for utility or gardening hooks that don't need to be screwed in. Purchase 2 hooks online or at a hardware store and hang them over the top of your fence to secure them. These no-screw hooks shouldn't require any further installation. Hanging hooks aren't as secure as hooks that are screwed directly into the fence but they are easier to install."

Choose the vines that you find the most visually appealing and are suitable for your local climate. Annual vines will typically grow faster than perennials but will die after the growing season.
