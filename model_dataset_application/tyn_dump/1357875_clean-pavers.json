You want a clear surface free of obstacles while cleaning. At this point, cover any surrounding landscaping with tarp that may be damaged by water or chemicals in the cleaning products. Be sure to also cover metal objects."

When all of the organic growth has been loosened, brush the debris off of your paved surface. If the growth is too heavy to remove by hand, spray a vegetation killer and wait at least two weeks before cleaning the pavers."

You don\u2019t need to power wash the area at this point; the pavers merely need to be wet so they don\u2019t soak up the cleanser and form a murky film."

Fill up a gallon sized bucket with water and add about 16oz of dish detergent. Mix the soap into the water thoroughly. Once your cleaning solution is ready, gently pour some onto your paver surface, working in small areas at a time."

Scrub in different directions to avoid wearing out the same spot. You may use a wire brush or scouring pad instead. Don't overdo it, as these tools can scratch the paver surface."

You can use a regular garden hose to rinse off the cleanser or use a power washer to blast off harsh stains. However, power washers can sometimes cause more harm than good (by excavating sand in between paver joints), so be careful if you decide to use a power washer."

Many of these are highly corrosive and/or toxic, including TSP (trisodium phosphate) and muriatic acid. Read the warning label and make sure everyone in the area follows safety precautions. This may include wearing rubber boots, protective clothing, rubber gloves, mask, and safety glasses. Strong treatments can be a risk to children, pets, and vegetation, and may damage your pavers if used incorrectly."

Sweep the sand all over on the paved surface with a dry, stiff bristled broom. Brush in multiple directions for more even coverage. Keep pouring on more sand and sweeping until the joints are filled. Polymeric sand locks the pavers together more effectively than regular sand."
