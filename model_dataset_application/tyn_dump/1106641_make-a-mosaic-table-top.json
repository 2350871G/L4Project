This will help you visualize what they will look like before you commit them to your table. It will also help you keep your tiles organized as you continue to construct your mosaic. If you are using uniform sized pieces for your mosaic, remember to leave gaps in between the tiles so that grout can fit in between them. Experiment with creating unique designs. If you don't like how your design looks, you can rearrange the tiles on the paper before you start constructing your table."
