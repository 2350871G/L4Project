You should only need to use a few drops or few sprays of solution, but you should consult the directions on the bottle just in case.

If you are cleaning items cabinets or doors, don\u2019t forget to clean the sides that are not in front of you.

It is important to ring out the cloth before cleaning because excess water can damage the woodwork if it penetrates the finish. You can use a cloth or rag to clean.
