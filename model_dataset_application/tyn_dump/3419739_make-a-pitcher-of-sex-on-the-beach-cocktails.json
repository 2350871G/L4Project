Using a chilled pitcher keeps the cocktails cooler for longer. If you have space in the fridge or freezer, place the cocktail glasses in there to chill as well."

Although the liquids should mix on their own, you could stir them with a long spoon if you like. Since you're using a lot of fruit juice, you can use an inexpensive vodka for the drinks. For smoother cocktails, use pulp-free orange juice."

For even more flavor, try a spiced rum. If you're not sure if you'll like the substitution, play around with using half vodka and half rum or tequila."
