You can find real wreaths in grocery stores and Christmas tree farms, while artificial ones are found in craft stores. Keep in mind that most stores do not sell these wreaths year-round. You are more likely to find them around the holiday season, typically November and December. Some wreaths come pre-lit or flocked with fake snow. You can use these if they fit your overall vision."

          "description":"Like artificial Christmas trees, artificial wreaths come compressed. Choose a point on the wreath to start at, then gently pull the branches away. Work your way around the wreath until you are back where you started. If the branches have smaller twigs, be sure to pull them away too. You don't have to pull the branches all the way out--just enough to give the wreath a fuller appearance. Skip this step if you have a real wreath. The branches are already fluffed out."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Flock the wreath with fake snow, if desired.",
          "description":"Purchase a can of fake snow spray from the craft store or Christmas tree farm. Follow the directions on the can to mist a light coating of fake snow onto your wreath. The product is similar to spray paint, except that it will coat the wreath with textured, white flocking instead. Let the product dry completely before moving on. You can use as much or as little flocking as you want. Keep in mind that the more you use, the harder it will be to secure the items to the wreath. How long the flocking takes to dry depends on the brand that you are using. Check the can for complete drying times, but expect to wait 8 to 24 hours."

          "description":"Buy one to two strands of battery-operated lights for the wreath. Wrap the lights around the wreath, then secure the battery pack to the back of it. Use green floral wire if it is a real wreath. If it is an artificial wreath, simply bend one or two twigs around the battery pack to hold it in place. Keep the lights proportionate to the wreath. Use standard-sized Christmas tree bulbs for large wreaths, and tiny \"fairy lights\" for small wreaths. A single strand of lights should be enough for a small wreath. A large wreath may require 2 strands."

    "Secure the battery pack to the back of the wreath with wire or hot glue.",
    "Make sure that you can access the switch and batteries easily.",
    "Create a bow for the wreath, if desired.",
    "Cut a long piece of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) wide wired ribbon.",
    "Wrap the ribbon around an undecorated part of the wreath, then tie it into a bow.",
    "Alternatively, you can tie the bow first, then tie it to the wreath with floral wire.",
    "The bow doesn't have to be on top or bottom of your wreath.",
    "It can be off to the side.",
    "Cut the flowers down to 1 inch (2.5 cm), if you are using them.",
    "Do not pull the fake flowers off of their stems, or you won't be able to secure them to the wreath.",
    "Instead, measure down 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the base of the bud, and cut the stem with wire cutters.",
    "If you bought miniature flowers, such as forget-me-nots, baby breath, or chamomile/daisies, simply cut the branches off the main stem.",
    "Arrange the flowers on the wreath.",
    "Start with the largest flowers, then fill the gaps in with the medium and small ones.",
    "You don't have to cover the entire wreath.",
    "For example, you could cover just the bottom-right corner.",
    "Arrange the flowers in groups of three for better composition and balance.",
    "If you are only covering a small part of the wreath, place the larger flowers in the center, and the smaller ones towards the edges.",
    "Secure the flowers to the wreath.",
    "In most cases, you should be able to just stick the stems through the vines that make up the wreath.",
    "If any flowers feel loose, use a small amount of hot glue to hold them in place.",
    "If you don't plan on reusing the wreath base, use as much hot glue as you want.",
    "If you wish to reuse the wreath base for other seasons, use the hot glue sparingly.",
    "This will make it easier to remove the flowers and insert new ones.",
    "Finish off with accents and greenery, if desired.",
    "You don't have to add these either, but they can take your wreath to the next level.",
    "Choose some floral accents in colors that match the rest of the wreath.",
    "Great options include berries and pine cones; a fall-themed wreath could benefit from pine cones and miniature pumpkins.",
    "Hot glue the items to the wreath as desired.",
    "If you are using berries, cut them from the stems first.",
    "They are typically sold alongside the other artificial flowers in a craft store."
