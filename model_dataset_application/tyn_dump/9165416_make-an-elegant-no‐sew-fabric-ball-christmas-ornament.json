Making an Ornament with Beading, Center Decorations, and Other Decorations Repeat the procedures above for a basic ball. Skip to here after you glued the fabric to the ball. Place nails on the top and bottom tips of the sections where the beads are to be placed. Don't full insert these in the ball fully yet, because you are going to be wrapping the wire for the beads around the pins.

Slipknot the wire around the top pin do the beads until you reach the bottom pin. Wrap around the bottom pin once in a slipknot. Counting the beads helps ensure the pattern is uniform on all sections.

Frames can put on before or after beading. These can be used to surround ornamentation. Necklace links with hoops on the ends can be placed on the beading line and glued on or using the tip above. After the beading is completed, use the same pins to secure threads and cords that'll outline the beads in an \"egg\" pattern if desired. Cut enough of the trimming to go around twice for two sections. Start by pinning through the cording at the top pin bring down to bottom pin. Stick the bottom pin through the cording and go back to top on the opposite section. Criss-cross over the first row to the bottom and go back to the top. Metallic threads and other small trimmings are just slipknot at the pins and follow the same above procedure. There are many more variations, like a double row of central beads or outlining a ribbon with beads on 2 sides. Add more pins and wire lengths. If doing the \"egg\" outline with ribbons or other trimmings dip the pins in glue and push them completely into the ball. Then glue. When finished with the central decorations, dip the pins in glue and push them firmly into the ball. Continue with the procedures to complete the basic ball. Creating a Designed Ornament Using the Fabric and\\/or Trimmings Create a harlequin or checkerboard design using two colors. Repeat the measurements procedures for basic ball cutting the sections, then cut the sections horizontally in half. Glue one half-section with the tip on the top of the ball. Glue one of other colors on the bottom of the first glued half section. Repeat alternating the colors. Finish the seams with narrow trimmings. Finish off by pinning sequins, beads, and rhinestones at the intersections. Make a half color ball. Follow the procedures for the measurements of the sections and cutting. Then skip to here. Cut two desired colors (4 sections equals 2 of each color). For a vertical split. Glue one color first then on the opposite section with top and bottom tips overlapping glue the second color. Cover the ball and complete procedures for the basic ball. For a horizontal split cut the sections horizontally in half equally. Glue the first color with the tip at the top of the ball. Glue the second color with the tip at the bottom of the ball. To the opposite, glue the third section (same color as the first top section) with tips overlapping and repeat. When the ball is covered, either cover that center seam before doing the other procedures (thin or flat trimmings) or after doing the other procedures. (thick trimmings) covering the vertical seams. Then complete the procedures for the basic ball. Create a flower pattern. Repeat the steps of the Basic Ball ornament until the ball is covered. Cut twice the number of the template pattern as the number of sections ( if it's four sections cut eight), half the height of the original sections. Glue these on top of the sections between the seams in the same direction as the original. Repeat on the bottom half of the ball. Cover the seams of these petals with a narrow trimmings or braids. Cover the seams of the ornament and complete the basic ball. Create \"lines\" ,\"v's\" ,\"x's\", designs with the ribbons and trimmings. These require carefully measuring to make sure the ends of the design meet at and are on the same height in each section for each quarter and the rows go in a single straight row in each section. Mark each measurement with measuring tape and pins or marker marks at the points of intersection in each quarter next to the seam. If you are using the pins to wrap cording or securing the decor for the ball, don't insert fully. Use the same technique for making swags with chains.
