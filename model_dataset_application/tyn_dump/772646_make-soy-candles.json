Collect the following supplies:\n2 ounces of soy wax flakes for every votive-sized candle you want to make. A 1-pound bag of soy wax chips will make 8 votive candles or 4 medium-sized candles. Wicks with anchors, which are small metal discs that keep the wick in place in the center of the candles. You'll need one wick for each candle you want to make. Candle dye. Your candles will naturally come out a creamy white, but you can add candle dye to make them a different color. Make sure you buy dye intended for use in candles, since other types of dye could ruin the wax. Scented oil. Unscented candles are versatile, but if you like scented candles, look for oils made specifically for candle making. If you need inspiration for picking out a scent, think about choosing one that pairs well with the color of your candle. Consider the following pairings, or come up with your own:\nWhite candles with vanilla or a floral scent. Pink candles with rose or strawberry scent. Purple candles with lavender or sugarplum scent. Yellow candles with banana, lemon or citronella scent, which keeps mosquitoes away when used outside."
