      "description":"Shotgun: To blow off its head, wait until the zombie gets really close to you, and then aim up and fire. Handgun/Samurai Edge: After two well placed shots to its upper chest, you might get lucky and blow off its head on the third shot. Also, when you and the zombie are at slightly different elevations and you aim up or down to its level, you have a higher chance of scoring a headshot. Samurai Edge gets more headshots than the Handgun. Under normal circumstances with the Handgun, about 1 in 10 shots will blow off their head. Magnum: You almost automatically get a headshot with this, but you should try to save Magnum ammo for the end of the game."

Make sure to kill it afterwards or it will come back as a zombie to full health once you re-enter the room or start crawling around the room right after."

The Fuel Canteen is what you fill with Kerosene, and is found in the East Stairs Save Room (the first save room you find). There are stationary bottles of Kerosene located all around the game for you to refill your Fuel Canteen (it only holds enough Kerosene to kill 2 separate zombies)."
