They are usually smaller and brighter in color. They will also have their own set of roots. Search for them along the base. Here are some things you should look for when selecting an offset to cut:\nThe offset should be one-fifth the size of the main plant. Choose an offset that has at least four leaves, and is several inches tall. Take the entire plant out of the pot, if you can. This will make it easier to find where the offshoot joins the main plant.
