          "description":"Although you could use single-sided ribbon, double-sided ribbon gives your entire rose beautiful color and sheen. Decide if you'd like to buy wired ribbon, which will hold its shape, or non-wired ribbon, which makes a loose, soft shape. Then, choose a ribbon material and color. Pick satin ribbon for a soft, shiny rose or use taffeta ribbon if you'd like a crisp, crinkly looking rose, for instance. You can also find novelty ribbon that has fun prints, texture, or lacy edges."

          "description":"Pull the ribbon off of the spool until it's at least 30 inches (76 cm) long. Keep in mind that a longer piece of ribbon makes a wider, fuller rose. Then, cut the piece of ribbon from the spool. A ribbon that's 30 inches (76 cm) long makes a rose that's about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) wide."

          "description":"Thread a needle with thread that matches the color of the ribbon and tie a knot at the end of the tail. Insert the needle through the bottom corner of the ribbon and pull until the knot catches. Then, make long, straight running stitches along the bottom of the ribbon. Don't cut the thread once you finish the running stitches. Work the running stitches about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from the bottom edge of the ribbon. This gives you a slight base for the bottom of the ribbon rose."

Then, wrap the ribbon tightly around the bud, keeping the edge with the stitches on the bottom.Tip: If you'd like to attach the rose to a stem, cut a piece of green floral wire so it's as long as you want the stem to be. Twist a knot into the end of the wire and press it onto the end of the ribbon before you roll the ribbon rose. The knot prevents the wire from slipping out of the rose."

Sew back and forth through the bottom of the ribbon rose until it is secure. Tie a knot and trim the thread tail close to the base of the rose once you've finished stitching."

If you want the rose to be around 2 inches (5.1 cm) high, make the rectangle 4 inches (10 cm) wide since you'll fold it in half. Work with a knit or woven fabric, such as chiffon or poplin, so you can pull it and make it gather. Felt won't bunch together, so avoid using it. Play around with making different sizes.

    "Ensure that you stitch through the bottom of each petal so they don't fall off of the rose.",
    "Overlap the large petals around the edge of the rose and stitch them in place.",

    "Overlap the petals a little and keep in mind that more of these petals will be visible than the smaller pieces at the center.",
    "Straight stitch across the base of the rose again so the bottoms of the petals are secure.",

    "Wet your fingers and curl the petal tops outward to shape the rose.",
    "Dip your fingers in warm water and gently shape each petal outward with your wet fingertips so they look like they're blossoming.",
    "Try to make the larger petals around the edge of the rose appear more open than the petals near the center of the rose.Tip: If you'd like to give your roses long stems, insert a thin green craft wire through the bottom of a rose.",
    "Trim the wire so it's as long as you want the stem to be.",
    "Then, wrap green floral tape around the stem and secure it to the bottom of the rose."
