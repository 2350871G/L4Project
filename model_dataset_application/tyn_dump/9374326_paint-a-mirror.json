          "description":"Mirror glass must be completely clean before you begin, otherwise the paint may not adhere to the surface well. Start by dampening a microfiber cloth with water and wiping the surface to remove any dust. Use a separate microfiber cloth to thoroughly dry the surface. If your mirror is quite dirty, use a mild soap solution to wipe it down. Follow up with plain water, and then dry the surface with the cloth. To get rid of fingerprints and greasy residue, dip the cloth in a small amount of rubbing alcohol and wipe down the surface."

          "description":"You don\u2019t have to create a highly detailed sketch. Instead, use a white water-soluble pencil to outline the main design elements onto the mirror\u2019s surface. This sketch helps you with placement and acts as a guide when you start painting. Purchase water-soluble pencils at any art supply store. It\u2019s important to use a water-soluble pencil so you can easily remove any remaining lines once you finish your painting. You don\u2019t have to use white, specifically, white shows up best on a mirrored surface."

          "headline":"Choose areas of your sketch that won\u2019t be painted.",
          "description":"One of the coolest things about painting on mirrors is that the areas you leave unpainted are just as important as the painted ones. The unpainted areas will remain reflective, acting as an ever-changing back drop to your painted piece. For example, if you are painting koi onto a mirror, don\u2019t paint the entire water backdrop blue. Leave a few unpainted areas in the water, which will create interesting effects once the painting is finished. If you are painting a portrait, sketch in the form of the person, but leave the backdrop unpainted. Once the painting is complete, the background behind the portrait will be reflective and ever-changing."

Do not apply gesso on the areas of the mirror you plan to leave reflective \u2013 only put it where your design will be painted. Paint right over your penciled lines; the gesso goes on opaque, but becomes much more transparent once it dries. Leave the gesso to dry for 24 hours before proceeding. Liquid gesso can be purchased at any art supply store."

Use a paintbrush to carefully fill in the areas you plan to paint with white acrylic. Make sure you carefully go over all of the gessoed areas with white paint.

However, if you prefer oil paint, you can use that. Squeeze a dollop of each color onto your palette. If you plan to mix any colors to create new ones, use your palette knife to do that now. For example, if you want to lighten any color, add a small amount of white paint. Use the knife to completely blend the two colors together. If you want it lighter, add more white and mix again. If you need to make brown paint, combine equal quantities of complementary colors. Complementary color pairings you can try: yellow and purple, green and red, or blue and orange."

If you still see a bit of white peeking through from underneath the dark paint, apply a thin second layer right over it. Keep clean Q-tips nearby. If you accidentally get paint in an area you want to remain reflective, quickly wipe it away using the cotton swab. If you have a pretty severe paint smear, grab some glass cleaner and dunk the Q-tip in that before wiping it away."

You can also fully complete one section of the painting at a time until it\u2019s finished. There\u2019s no \u201ccorrect\u201d approach, so do what feels natural for you. Use a fresh paintbrush for each paint color you work with. Use the size that makes sense for the area you\u2019re painting. For example, use a small brush for detail work.
