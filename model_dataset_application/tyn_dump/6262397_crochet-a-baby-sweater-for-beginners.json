  "text":" Part One: Yoke[1]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Tie the yarn to the hook. Attach the primary yarn to your crochet hook using a standard slip knot. Note that the primary yarn (color A) will be used for the yoke, body, and sleeves of the sweater. The secondary yarn (color B) will only be used for the edging. Work a foundation chain. Work 32 chain stitches from the loop on your hook to create your foundation row. Turn your work once you reach the end. You'll need 32 chain stitches to create a sweater sized for babies between 3 and 9 months old. For babies in 6 to 12 month clothing, create a bigger sweater by starting with 43 chain stitches.

Once you reach the end of the row, chain two and turn the work. Half double crochet across the second row. Work one half double crochet into each of the first two stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that. Afterward, half double crochet once into each of the next three stitches and twice into the stitch the follows those. Repeat this pattern across the rest of the row. Note that the stitch count will increase by the time you reach the end of this row, creating a slight curve. Once you reach the end of the row, chain two and turn the work. Half double crochet across the third row. Work one half double crochet into each stitch across the entire row. Chain two at the end of the row, then turn the work over. Increase the fourth row. Work one half double crochet into each of the first three stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that. Afterward, half double crochet once in each of the next four stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that. Repeat this pattern across the row.

Chain two and turn at the end of the row. For row six: Half double crochet once in each of the first four stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that. Half double crochet once in each of the next five stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that; repeat across the row. Chain two and turn at the end.

Half double crochet once in each of the next eight stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that; repeat across the row. Chain two and turn at the end. Do not fasten off. The yoke should be done by this step, but you should not cut the yarn or fasten it off. Part Two: Body[2]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Create armholes. Work a series of chain stitches and half double crochets across the last row of the yoke to form the armhole base row. Half double crochet once into each of the first seven stitches, then half double crochet twice into the eighth stitch. Half double crochet once into each of the seven stitches after that. Chain five (for 3 to 9 month size) or seven (for 6 to 12 month size), and skip 16 (for 3 to 9 month size) or 19 (for 6 to 12 month size). Half double crochet once into each of the next eight stitches (3 to 9 month) or ten stitches (6 to 12 month). Half double crochet twice into the stitch after that. Repeat once, then half double crochet once into each of the next eight (3 to 9 month) or ten (6 to 12 month) stitches. Chain five (3 to 9 month) or seven (6 to 12 month), and skip 16 (3 to 9 month) or 19 (6 to 12 month). Half double crochet once into each of the next seven stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that. Half double crochet once into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row. Turn your work at the end of the row. Work v-stitches across the first body row. Double crochet once into the first stitch from the hook. Skip two stitches, then work one v-stitch into the stitch after that. Work v-stitches across the rest of the row, skipping two stitches in between each one. Continue until you reach the last two stitches. To create a v-stitch: double crochet once, chain one, and double crochet once more into the same space. Double crochet once into the last stitch. Chain three at the end of the row, then turn the work. Cluster stitch across the second body row. Double crochet once into the first stitch from the hook, then cluster stitch into the center of each v-stitch in the previous row. More precisely, you must cluster stitch into the chain-one space of each v-stitch. Double crochet once into the final stitch of the row. Chain three at the end of the row, then turn over the work. Repeat the body rows to desired length. Alternate back and forth between the first (v-stitch) and second (cluster stitch) body rows until the sweater reaches an appropriate length. For 3 to 9 month sweaters, you'll need approximately eight body rows total. For 6 to 12 month sweaters, you'll need approximately 12 body rows total. Fasten off the yarn. When you reach the end of the final body row, cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work. Use a yarn needle to weave the remaining tail into the stitches along the underside of the garment. Doing so should hide the excess while further securing the end. Part Three: Sleeves Join the yarn. Tie the yarn to your crochet hook, then attach the yarn to the center bottom of one armhole using a slip stitch. Slip stitch around the armhole. Work one slip stitch into each stitch around the armhole. You'll need 23 stitches for 3 to 9 month sizes, or 30 stitches for 6 to 12 month sizes. Join the last slip stitch to the first with another slip stitch. Half double crochet in the round. Chain two, then work one half double crochet into each stitch across the previous round. Slip stitch the last and first stitches together to create another round. Do not turn the work at the end of the round. Repeat the round to your desired length. Continue working rounds of half double crochet to match the previous round. Repeat as needed until the sleeve reaches an adequate length. For a long-sleeve 3 to 9 month size, you'll need approximately 10 rounds total. For a long-sleeve 6 to 12 month size, you'll need approximately 14 rounds total. Decrease one round. Half double crochet once into the first stitch, skip two stitches, then half double crochet once into the stitch after that. Repeat across the round. Slip stitch the last and first stitches together at the end of the round. Decreasing the stitch count in this manner creates a cuff for the sleeve. Slip stitch across the final round. Work one slip stitch into each stitch of the previous round. This will be the final round of the sleeve. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. Weave the excess tail into the stitches along the inside of the sleeve. Repeat for the other sleeve. Work a second sleeve onto the other armhole. Follow the same procedure used to create the first sleeve. Note that both sleeves must be identical, so you need to use the same amount of stitches in each one. Pay close attention to your stitch count to maintain uniformity. Part Four: Edging[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Join the contrasting yarn to the bottom of the sweater. Tie the secondary yarn to the crochet hook with a slip knot, then join the yarn to the bottom of the sweater with a slip stitch. Join the yarn to either end of the bottom edge; do not join it to the center of this edge. Single crochet across the first row. Work one single crochet into each stitch across the entire row. Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end of the row. Double crochet increase across the second row. Work two double crochets into each stitch across the entire row. Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end of the row. Chain and double crochet across the final row. Chain four, then work one double crochet into the same stitch as your chain. Afterward, chain two, then double crochet once into the next stitch. Repeat this pattern across the row. Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to secure the end. Weave the excess along the underside of the ruffled edge. Repeat the ruffle on both sleeves. Follow the same steps to create a ruffle on the open edge of both sleeves. The pattern remains the same, but at the end of each row, you'll need to slip stitch the last and first stitches together. Part Five: Finishing Tie ribbon to the yoke. Cut six 5-inch (12.5-cm) lengths of 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) wide ribbon. Tie these pieces of ribbon to either edge of the yoke. The ribbon should roughly match the color of the secondary yarn (color B). Tie three pieces to the right side and three pieces to the left, positioning them as close to the garment edge as possible. Pair the pieces off into three sets of ribbon. Put on the sweater. Put the finished sweater on the baby. To close it, tie each of the three ribbon pairs into bows.",

    "Repeat once, then half double crochet once into each of the next eight (3 to 9 month) or ten (6 to 12 month) stitches.",
    "Chain five (3 to 9 month) or seven (6 to 12 month), and skip 16 (3 to 9 month) or 19 (6 to 12 month).",
    "Half double crochet once into each of the next seven stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that.",
    "Half double crochet once into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.",
    "Turn your work at the end of the row.",
    "Work v-stitches across the first body row.",
    "Double crochet once into the first stitch from the hook.",
    "Skip two stitches, then work one v-stitch into the stitch after that.",
    "Work v-stitches across the rest of the row, skipping two stitches in between each one.",
    "Continue until you reach the last two stitches.",
    "To create a v-stitch: double crochet once, chain one, and double crochet once more into the same space.",
    "Double crochet once into the last stitch.",
    "Chain three at the end of the row, then turn the work.",
    "Cluster stitch across the second body row.",
    "Double crochet once into the first stitch from the hook, then cluster stitch into the center of each v-stitch in the previous row.",
    "More precisely, you must cluster stitch into the chain-one space of each v-stitch.",
    "Double crochet once into the final stitch of the row.",
    "Chain three at the end of the row, then turn over the work.",
    "Repeat the body rows to desired length.",
    "Alternate back and forth between the first (v-stitch) and second (cluster stitch) body rows until the sweater reaches an appropriate length.",
    "For 3 to 9 month sweaters, you'll need approximately eight body rows total.",
    "For 6 to 12 month sweaters, you'll need approximately 12 body rows total.",
    "Fasten off the yarn.",
    "When you reach the end of the final body row, cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail.",
    "Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work.",
    "Use a yarn needle to weave the remaining tail into the stitches along the underside of the garment.",
    "Doing so should hide the excess while further securing the end.",
    "Part Three: Sleeves Join the yarn.",
    "Tie the yarn to your crochet hook, then attach the yarn to the center bottom of one armhole using a slip stitch.",
    "Slip stitch around the armhole.",
    "Work one slip stitch into each stitch around the armhole.",
    "You'll need 23 stitches for 3 to 9 month sizes, or 30 stitches for 6 to 12 month sizes.",
    "Join the last slip stitch to the first with another slip stitch.",
    "Half double crochet in the round.",
    "Chain two, then work one half double crochet into each stitch across the previous round.",
    "Slip stitch the last and first stitches together to create another round.",
    "Do not turn the work at the end of the round.",
    "Repeat the round to your desired length.",
    "Continue working rounds of half double crochet to match the previous round.",
    "Repeat as needed until the sleeve reaches an adequate length.",
    "For a long-sleeve 3 to 9 month size, you'll need approximately 10 rounds total.",
    "For a long-sleeve 6 to 12 month size, you'll need approximately 14 rounds total.",
    "Decrease one round.",
    "Half double crochet once into the first stitch, skip two stitches, then half double crochet once into the stitch after that.",
    "Repeat across the round.",
    "Slip stitch the last and first stitches together at the end of the round.",
    "Decreasing the stitch count in this manner creates a cuff for the sleeve.",
    "Slip stitch across the final round.",
    "Work one slip stitch into each stitch of the previous round.",
    "This will be the final round of the sleeve.",
    "Fasten off the yarn.",
    "Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail.",
    "Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.",
    "Weave the excess tail into the stitches along the inside of the sleeve.",
    "Repeat for the other sleeve.",
    "Work a second sleeve onto the other armhole.",
    "Follow the same procedure used to create the first sleeve.",
    "Note that both sleeves must be identical, so you need to use the same amount of stitches in each one.",
    "Pay close attention to your stitch count to maintain uniformity.",
    "Part Four: Edging[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Join the contrasting yarn to the bottom of the sweater.",
    "Tie the secondary yarn to the crochet hook with a slip knot, then join the yarn to the bottom of the sweater with a slip stitch.",
    "Join the yarn to either end of the bottom edge; do not join it to the center of this edge.",
    "Single crochet across the first row.",
    "Work one single crochet into each stitch across the entire row.",
    "Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end of the row.",
    "Double crochet increase across the second row.",
    "Work two double crochets into each stitch across the entire row.",
    "Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end of the row.",
    "Chain and double crochet across the final row.",
    "Chain four, then work one double crochet into the same stitch as your chain.",
    "Afterward, chain two, then double crochet once into the next stitch.",
    "Repeat this pattern across the row.",
    "Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end.",
    "Fasten off the yarn.",
    "Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail.",
    "Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to secure the end.",
    "Weave the excess along the underside of the ruffled edge.",
    "Repeat the ruffle on both sleeves.",
    "Follow the same steps to create a ruffle on the open edge of both sleeves.",
    "The pattern remains the same, but at the end of each row, you'll need to slip stitch the last and first stitches together.",
    "Part Five: Finishing Tie ribbon to the yoke.",
    "Cut six 5-inch (12.5-cm) lengths of 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) wide ribbon.",
    "Tie these pieces of ribbon to either edge of the yoke.",
    "The ribbon should roughly match the color of the secondary yarn (color B).",
    "Tie three pieces to the right side and three pieces to the left, positioning them as close to the garment edge as possible.",
    "Pair the pieces off into three sets of ribbon.",
    "Put on the sweater.",
