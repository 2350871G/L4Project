At most, the compost material should reach a depth of 4 in (10 cm) in the pit. When estimating the hole's size, keep in mind that the compost material will be finely chopped or torn to pieces before being thrown in the hole. Your pit can be as wide as you like. Garden rows, for example, can be enriched with a compost trench dug at standard pit depth. If you have a lot of compost material, you can dig a deeper pit, but avoid going deeper than about 3.2 ft (1 m). Important decomposing organisms cannot live beneath this depth. Try making your pit longer or wider if you need room for more material."
