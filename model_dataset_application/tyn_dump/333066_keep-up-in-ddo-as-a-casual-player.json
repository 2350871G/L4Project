If you play a Cleric, you will be able to spend less of your rare game time looking for groups.

But if you take the time to get the bonuses, you might get more XP per quest, but only complete 3 quests in the same hour for a total of 9,000 XP. And you will have less loot and favor too.

So, if you have made it to level 10, one option would be to do all of the level 9 quests that take an hour to finish and give 1500 to 3000 XP. For a casual player, it might take a month or more to level up using this method. Or, you could build a level 10 to 14  party that includes a couple of good level 14 players, and then do Madstone Crater on normal, hard, and elite difficulties. The base XP of Madstone Crater is around 15,000 XP. You will get a conquest bonus without any extra effort most of the time, which is about 3250 XP. You will get a first time bonus of either 3250 or 6500 depending on difficulty. And you will get a few other bonuses as you complete it. So, even with the 50% penalty, you will be getting over 15,000 XP on normal and hard, and over 18,000 XP on elite. Continue this with other Gianthold quests and you will soon level up to where you are no longer taking a penalty."
