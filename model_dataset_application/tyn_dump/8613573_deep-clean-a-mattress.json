This is important, as dirt, grime, and bad scents can accumulate on sheets, mattress liners, mattress protectors, and other things we commonly put on top of our mattresses. Carefully fold your sheets up as you remove them so more dust or dirt does not fall on to the mattress. Remove any mattress protectors you may have covered it with.

Without vacuuming it properly, there will be a lot of dirt and debris left on the mattress \u2013 undermining your effort to clean it. Use an upholstery attachment with your vacuum. Systematically go back-and-forth width-wise on the mattress until you vacuum the whole thing. Use the crevice attachment to vacuum hard-to-reach places like crevices, indentations, and embroidery.
