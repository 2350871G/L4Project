If using fresh chili peppers in the salsa, knowing how to peel them is an important part of the preparation process. There are two basic methods, one for those who have access to a gas flame and one for those who only have an electrical heat source. In both cases, be aware that the fumes from heated chilies can irritate your lungs, so do not inhale. Peel the chili peppers over the gas burner: Spear the chili peppers onto a long metal skewer. Turn on a gas burner flame and roast them over the flame. When the skins to blister and darken, remove them. Don't allow them to burn. Dry fry the chili peppers in a griddle pan. When the skins become scorched and blackened, remove the chilies. For both heated chili peppers, now place them into a plastic bag. Tie the bag up to trap the steam. Put the bag aside for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, take the chilies out of the bag and peel off the skin. The capsaicin in chili peppers can irritate your skin and eyes badly. Do not absent-mindedly wipe your eyes or pick your nose with your chili pepper covered fingers! Wash your hands with soap and water after finishing handling the chili peppers, or wear gloves. To finish preparing the chili peppers, slit the peeled chilies open and scrape out the seeds.  Chop up the chili peppers into small diced pieces and put to one side in a small bowl, ready for use.  Classic tomato salsa Assemble the ingredients and items needed to make the salsa.  Decide how hot you'd like the salsa to be.

Mix everything together gently until you see the sugar dissolve. Aim to coat everything with the lime juice. Cover the salsa bowl. Place it into the refrigerator to chill and marinate for 2\u20133 hours. This will give the flavors time to blend well. Before serving, throw a few lime rind pieces on top to garnish.
