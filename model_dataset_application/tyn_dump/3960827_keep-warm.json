          "description":"Move furniture away from your radiators. Opt for curtains that don\u2019t wrap around the radiator. You should avoid putting anything on the radiator itself at all costs, but placing a shelf above it, if you have room for it, can help stop the air from rising directly above it and can bring more warmth to your home. Better yet, place a layer of heat reflective aluminum behind your radiator. If the radiator is connected to an outside wall, the heat will reflect into the room, instead of absorbing into the wall itself."

Any exposed wood will be less effective at trapping heat than a nice, warm rug; in fact, up to 10% of heat lost in homes comes from the uninsulated floors."

Attach a layer to the back of the curtains with self-adhesive Velcro, and then remove the lining in the spring. If you don't want to pay up for new curtains, you can line them yourself with cheap fleece or other less costly materials.

If you have a chimney but aren't using it, you can also invest in a chimney balloon to keep it from letting in the cold and releasing the warmth in your home. Also, if you frequently step out to smoke or just have people going in and out of the house all the time, make sure that the door is open for as little time as possible. If you want to get fancy, you can even invest in (or make) a draught excluder, which is a stuffed piece of material made of cotton that is placed at the bottom of doors to keep out the cold.

This will not only save money, but can prevent power outages in cold areas where everyone is using his or her thermostat. You can find fairly efficient warming mats for outdoor pets. Place the warming mat on your chair and a wool blanket over your lap to create a warmer environment. At night, use a hot water bottle. You can purchase them for $10 or less online. Also, wearing an extra layer of clothing, such as leggings under your pants, or a wool sweater, can go a long way in keeping you warm inside your own home. Instead of turning your thermostat up higher, turn it on earlier to give your house time to heat up.
