  "text":" Prepare the vodka selection Select six different vodka brands, all unflavored. You will probably want to test at least six brands of vodka to make this a proper tasting experience. If you only test two or three brands, your party won\u2019t last very long, and if you test more than six brands, you and your guests may become too inebriated to rate them properly! Purchase or find six identical containers to pour each brand of vodka into. You won't be able to just cover up the label of the bottles since even the design of the bottles could give away what vodka it contains. The containers need to be freezer-proof. Freeze the bottles of vodka and the six containers for several hours or overnight.  Remove the bottles of vodka from the freezer when they are thoroughly chilled. Always serve vodka ice cold. If the ice in your sink or cooler starts to melt too fast, return the containers of vodka to the freezer before you pour the next tasting. Transfer each brand of vodka into the six containers. Allow 1 ounce (30ml) of vodka for each guest for each brand to be rated. For example, if you are having six guests, you will need to pour 6 ounces (180ml) of each brand into the respective blind taste test containers.

Keep the code in a safe place where the guests cannot see it. Place the appropriately coded label on each of the six containers.  Put the labeled vodka containers in a cooler or a bowl filled with ice after all of your guests have arrived.  Make vodka scorecards Create a vodka scorecard for each of your guests. Make a grid on a sheet of paper with one row for each brand of vodka and four columns. Label each row with the code for each brand of vodka. Label the columns \u2018aroma,\u2019 \u2018smoothness,\u2019 \u2018crispness,\u2019 and \u2018overall taste.\u2019 Print the scoring criteria on the bottom of each scorecard so that guests don't have to guess what the numbers mean. For example, you might state that a score of \u201c1\u201d indicates poor aroma, smoothness, crispness or taste; a score of \u201c2\u201d indicates fair rating of the category, and so on. A score of \u201c5\u201d indicates a superior rating in any of the categories. Prepare the accompanying appetizers Be sure to have plenty of appetizers on hand so that your guests can cleanse their palates between tastings, and so that food can help absorb the alcohol they will be drinking. Although the higher the quality of the vodkas you use, the less there will be a need to cleanse the palate since highly distilled vodkas don\u2019t linger on the palate like other hard liquors. Provide the following sorts of appetizers: Salty hors d'oeuvres, such as pickled herring and caviar. A variety of food choices in case any of your guests are vegetarians, such as deviled eggs, pickles, olives and slices of cucumbers and tomatoes. A variety of crackers and cheese. A plate of cured and salted meats and pates with fresh breads. Start the tasting Once your guests are seated, give each of them a scorecard and a pencil. If you and your guests are going to be seated informally in a living room, make sure they have a place where they can easily mark their scorecards. Pour the first vodka into each guest\u2019s shot glass.  Ask your friends to taste the selection. Have each person write down his or her ratings on the scorecards. Encourage the eating of appetizers between each tasting.  Wait about 15 minutes before pouring the second vodka into clean shot glasses. If you don\u2019t have enough shot glasses for each round of tasting, this gives you plenty of opportunity to wash the first set out while your guests are enjoying their snacks. Have your guests continue to taste and rate each brand of vodka, serving them water and food between tastings. Encourage them to sip and taste, rather than drinking the vodka as a shot. Ask everyone to tally up their scores after the last brand of vodka has been tasted and rated.  Announce the name of each vodka brand and its code. Refer to the piece of paper that you wrote the matching codes on when you labeled the containers earlier in the evening. Tally up the cumulative scores and declare the winning vodka brand. Another round can be shared of the winning vodka, just for fun.",
