When you're slicing, move the knife back forth using a minimal amount of pressure and let it do most of the work for you. For the best results, refrigerate your turkey overnight after cooking it and prior to slicing it."

          "description":"Start by washing your tomato in cold water and remove any stickers from it. Now, use a sharp straight-edged or serrated kitchen knife to cut it into slices of the same thickness. Afterward, either stack the slices on top of one another or align them next to each other and cut them into strips. Finally, cut the strips into equally sized dice. Cut the initial slices close together for small diced tomatoes and farther apart for thicker dices. Hold the knife steady from the top using your non-dominant hand."

Hold your grater at a 45-degree angle to the board and start swiping the cheese gently across the grater in up and down motions. Afterward, tap the metal end of the grater against the edge of your cutting board to remove the excess trimmings. Hold the cheese firmly and exercise caution so you don't cut yourself."
