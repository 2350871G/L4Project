Italians twirl the pasta because it allows them to capture other ingredients that are blended into the pasta dish, like nuts or capers. This method works with more pasta dishes than spaghetti. Traditionally, you would see more Italians using both a fork and a spoon to twirl their pasta. While this is not technically wrong, the modern trend is to use a fork instead.

Take the fork, and twirl some noodles around the tines of it. At the same time, anchor the fork on the side or the bottom of the plate. Some people then twirl the fork on a spoon, but others just use the fork. If using a fork and spoon, hold the spoon in your left hand, and the fork in your right. Push the fork tines through the pasta meeting the spoon on the opposite side. Hold the spoon firmly, and twirl the fork until no strands are hanging from it. Now, lift the fork to your mouth. You could also cut the pasta into small pieces with a fork or knife, making it easy to eat with either a fork or a spoon. Many people will serve spaghetti noodles to children in this manner."

Start by snapping the chopsticks apart. Take one stick in your dominant hand and hold the narrower tip like you would a pencil. You want to hold the stick so that only an inch of the thicker end is sticking out of the area between your forefinger and thumb. This is the base stick, which doesn't move as you manipulate the other stick between your index finger and thumb to clench the noodles between the two sticks. The same general process is used to eat noodles with chopsticks that aren't in soup broth. Asian countries such as China, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand use chopsticks to pick up the noodles and deposit them in a large spoon; then eat the contents."

In other countries, it's not done as often (such as in Thailand). In some cultures, such as in Japan, it\u2019s also appropriate to pick up the entire soup bowl and to drink or slurp down the remaining broth in it. Slurping noodles actually has a practical purpose. It\u2019s done because the breath cools down piping hot soup before you eat it."
