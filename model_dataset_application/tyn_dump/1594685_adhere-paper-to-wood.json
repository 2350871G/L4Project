If you don't have a tack cloth, a damp cloth or paper towel will work as well. If you're only gluing on one side of the wood, you only have to sand that side.

Make sure the mod podge looks like a translucent white on the wood. If it's clear, add more. If it looks completely white, spread it around a little thinner. It's okay if you get glue on spots that the paper won't cover. The mod podge dries clear. Mod podge dries quickly, so don't wait long before you press the paper down."

Don\u2019t try to cover the whole wood surface yet, because you\u2019ll spread the glue around next. Tacky glue is available online or at craft stores. It comes in clear and white varieties. Both dry clear, so either works for this project. Wood glue is a good alternative to tacky glue, but it may make the paper wrinkle more than tacky glue will. White glue that children use in school is similar to tacky glue, but it\u2019s more watered down and could cause the paper to bubble up, so it's not a good choice.

Make sure you spread the glue all the way to the edge of the wood so the paper doesn\u2019t start lifting. Add more glue as you need it. The glue should be a translucent white when it\u2019s spread out. If it looks completely clear, the layer is too thin. Add some more glue.

Set the piece in a safe place and come back in 1 hour to complete the job. To ensure an even smoother finish, place something flat and heavy on top of the paper.
