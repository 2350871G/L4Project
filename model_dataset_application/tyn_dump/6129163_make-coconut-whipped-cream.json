          "description":"Place a 14-ounce (400 ml) can of coconut cream or full-fat coconut milk in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or overnight. This will help the cream separate from the liquid. Coconut cream contains less water than coconut milk, so it should yield more whipped cream. Choose unsweetened coconut cream or milk that doesn't contain guar gum since this can prevent the coconut cream from whipping."

Starting with a cold bowl and beaters will help the coconut cream whip up faster. The coconut whipped cream will also have more volume. If you'd like to whip the cream by hand, chill a large balloon whisk."

          "headline":"Separate the coconut cream from the liquid.",
          "description":"Remove the can of coconut cream or milk from the refrigerator and open it. Carefully scoop out the cream that's floated to the top of the can and put it into the chilled bowl from the freezer. Then pour the liquid that's left in the can into a storage container. Use the leftover liquid to make fruit smoothies or use it like light-coconut milk in baking recipes. You can store it for up to 3 days. Ensure that you don't shake the can too much or the cream will mix back into the liquid before you have a chance to separate them."

Gradually turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and whip the cream until soft peaks form. This will take 1 to 2 minutes depending on how cold your coconut cream is. If you see liquid pooling in the bottom of the bowl as you begin to whip, stop and pour it out."

If you're frosting baked goods with the whipped cream, refrigerate them until you're ready to serve or the coconut whipped cream will begin to separate. Store leftover coconut whipped cream in an airtight container for up to 10 days. It will firm up so you'll need to re-whip it before you use it again."
