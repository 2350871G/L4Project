Make sure that the bottom row of tissue paper circles hangs lower than than the paper globe lamp to give it that flowing, whimsical look. Cover the entire paper globe lantern in tissue paper circles. Repeat Step 5 until the entire paper globe lantern is covered in tissue paper circles. As you move up with each row, ensure that about one inch of the row below is visible underneath.
