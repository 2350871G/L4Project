  "text":" Removing the Old Door Break apart the caulking on the trim of the door. Do this by gently slicing through it with the corner of a chisel, moving around the length of the door frame. This way, less paint is stretched or removed along with the trim. Remove any trim surrounding the door frame. You can do this carefully with a hammer and chisel. Wedge your chisel between the trim and the wall. Next, gently hammer the chisel into position. Finally, move the chisel back and forth to loosen the trim. Set aside the trim, either for re-application later or for discarding. Take extra care in removing the trim if you're going to be re-using the trim after installing the door. Cracked or broken trim will make for a less professional-looking door in the end. Remove any nails or screws attaching the door frame to the studs of the wall. A hacksaw, chisel, and hammer may be necessary to completely detach the nails and screws from their moorings on the studs. Once the nails and screws have been removed, close the door and tip it back toward the direction in which you removed the trim. The door should fall easily through the opening. Having a friend or family member nearby to help you with this step is recommended, especially if the door and frame are heavy. Prepping the Site and the Door Start by checking your rough opening. This is the width and height of the measurements between the rough framing. Rough openings need to be 2 inches (5 cm) wider and 2 1/2 inches (5.7 cm) taller than the actual door size you will be installing. If it's too big or small you will need to correct it; otherwise it will make for a difficult installation. For example, if you are installing a 30 inch (76 cm) wide door you will need a 32 inch (81 cm) wide rough opening. A normal sized door, 80 inches (200 cm) in height, would need an 82-1/2 inch (~209 cm) tall opening. Prep the door for installation. Remove any packing or shipping bands that are still attached to the door. Sleeves on the sides of doors should also be removed. Remove the lock brace from the side of the door; failure to do this now will result in a whole lot of hassle later. Installing the New Door Using Brackets Use a bracket system for efficiency. Brackets leave doors hanging very true. They are easy to install with one person and will cut your installation time in half. Brackets will also allow you to easily adjust the door clearances should you need to. Using a 4- or 6 foot (1.2 - 1.8 m) level, draw a vertical plumb line on the drywall 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in from the rough opening. This line must be on the hinge side and in the room the door swings into. Make sure that the vertical line is both straight and level. A straight line that is not level with the bottom of the floor will leave a door that doesn't swing true. Screw three brackets to back of door frame, beside the hinges. Using the 1/2\u201d (1.27 cm) screws provided, install brackets beside each hinge, making sure that they're even with the edge of the door frame. Getting the brackets right next to the hinges is extremely important. The hinges are the pressure points of the door, and improperly installed brackets that are out of line with the hinges will eventually cause the door to fall out of plumb. Screw the other three brackets on the latch side of the door. Start 8\u201d (20 cm) down from the top, and then once again 1\u201d (2.5 cm) above the latch hole, and a final bracket 6\" to 8\u201d (15 to 20 cm) up from the bottom of the door. The final bracket, if there is one, is recommended for the top, on doors 30\u201d and wider. The door is now ready to insert in the rough opening. Place 1/2\" (1.27 cm) blocks on the bottom of the floor for carpet, and 1/4\" (0.635 cm) blocks for vinyl or laminate. Never place the door directly on the bottom of the floor. Starting at the top hinge, match up one of the lines on the bracket with the level line drawn at the beginning.  Screw the door to the wall using the drywall screws provided. Work your way down the hinge side of the door, starting at the top, and making sure to use the same line for each of the three hinge brackets. Next, check the clearance between the frame and the door on the top and knob side. Take care to make sure they are equal. It's easier to unscrew the drywall screws at this point than after the final screws are already embedded in the drywall. Starting at the top again and working down, continue screwing the screws into the your brackets on the latch side. Keep the clearance between the frame and door equal as you screw the door to the wall with the drywall screws. Install any trim over top of the brackets. Most trim will have hollowed out backside, which will both allow the brackets to fit underneath and conceal them. If your trim doesn't have a hollowed out backside, you may need to hammer the brackets into the drywall just a little. Installing the New Door Using Shims Place three shims at the location of each hinge on the inner part of the door.  Drill a pilot hole through the doorstop and the shims, and then hammer in a nail into the upper shim in order to hold the door into place.  Check that the door is completely straight and plump with a 6 foot (182 cm) level. This part is all about using the level to test whether your placement is straight and level. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the shims in order to get a straight fit. Place a level along the hinge side jamb, checking to see that it's straight. If it's not, adjust the middle and lower shims until the level indicates the jamb is straight. Once completed, place the level at the jamb, checking to see that it's level. If it's not, adjust the jamb and the shims until the level indicates that it's level. Drill pilot holes through the doorstop and shims at the middle and lower shims. Then, hammer in nails through the pilot holes at the shims, anchoring the jamb to the wall. Line up three more shims on the latch side of the wall, directly across from the shims on the hinge side. Make sure that they are as level as possible with the shims on the hinge side. Drill pilot holes through the doorstop and shims at the upper, middle, and lower shims on the latch side. Finish the process by hammering in nails at the pilot holes, checking all the while that the jamb is still straight and level. Put shims into two locations at the top of the door frame. Drill pilot holes into the shims at the top of the door frame and then secure them with one nail each. Check to see that the door and the door frame are evenly spaced. Pre-drill eight pilot holes at each of the shim locations on the narrow side of the jamb. After drilling, hammer in eight nails at each of these locations, securing the inner jamb to the wall. Sink the heads of the nails completely into the jamb using a nail set. You don't want the heads of nails interfering with the swing of the door. Replace the hinge screws with 2-1/2\" (6.35 cm) screws to add more stability and balance.  Break off any portion of the shims that are protruding from the door jamb. Break off either with a hammer or a balled-up fist. File or sand down any small, jagged pieces that may be tougher to get at with a larger implement. Install any trim over the door frame. Use the old trim, if desired, saved from the old door frame, or install new trim to match your new door.",
