  "text":" Making a Tattoo Choker Buy some elastic jewelry cord. You should be able to find this at a craft store like Michael\u2019s or Joann Fabric, or you could just purchase it online. It comes in a variety of colors. Cut the cord. Cut a piece of cord about two arm-lengths long. Making this choker uses a lot of cord. If in doubt, err on the side of too much\u2014you can always trim it later. Clip the cord onto a clipboard.

Melt the knot together with a match or lighter to keep the Stretch Magic Cord from coming untied while you\u2019re wearing the choker. Making a Chain\\/String Pendant Choker Figure out how long to cut chain or string. You can do this either by using a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your neck and then adding an inch, or by simply wrapping the chain around your neck and adding an inch. When you\u2019ve got the right measurement, cut the chain. Then cut another chain which is longer than the first. Attach a clasp to the chains. Use a jump ring to link together one end of each chain and a lobster clasp. Close the jump ring with a pair of needle-nose pliers. Jewelry-making supplies like lobster clasps and jump rings can be purchased online or from craft stores, or you can recycle them from old jewelry. Add the pendant to the choker. Thread both chains through the loop on the pendant. If the loop is not big enough, attach a jump ring to it and thread the chains through that so the pendant can slide easily. See how it looks. Fasten the smaller of the two chains around your neck using the lobster clasp. Using a mirror, adjust the length of the second chain until it hangs the way you want it to. Cut it to that length, and attach it to the first chain with a jump ring. Making a Simple Ribbon Choker Figure out what length you need.
