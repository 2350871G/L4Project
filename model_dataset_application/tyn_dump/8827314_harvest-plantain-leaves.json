Snip the leaves at the narrowest part of the stalk, leaving the root section behind. In no time at all the leaves will grow back, replenishing your supply. To harvest a whole patch, gather the leaves from the bottom, lift them up and cut across all the stalks at once.

Pick the seeds once they\u2019ve turned brown or black\u2014green seeds will be too tough and fibrous to be of any use. Plantain seeds have a nutty, slightly spicy flavor.

Store dried plantain leaves in a lidded jar or airtight plastic bag. Be sure to label the bags individually so you\u2019ll know what\u2019s in them.
