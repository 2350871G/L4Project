Using honey will increase the time required to fully dry the fruit leather. If you don't have a food processor, a blender will do. Try to get the puree as smooth as possible, since lumps will hurt the texture of your fruit leather. The lemon juice acts as a flavor enhancer and natural preservative. Add more or less to taste."
