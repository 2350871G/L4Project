The length and type of wood don\u2019t matter, but the longer the twig is, the more beads you'll be able to make! You don't have to use the entire twig to make your bead(s).

If the bark just won't come off, boil the twigs in water for a few minutes, then try again. Some types of wood will be a lot easier to peel than others. Don\u2019t worry if there\u2019s some bark left, however; you can always sand it off later."

The space between each set of lines will create 1 bead. Make the spaces between these lines a little bit bigger than you want your beads to be. This will allow room for shrinkage and error. The beads don't have to be the same size. If you want them to be all the same size, however, use a ruler to make the marks."

Align the first mark on the twig with the slit on the bench hook. A split bench hook looks like a regular bench hook, except that it has a slit in it for a saw to fit into. A bench hook is a wooden board with wooden stoppers at each end, 1 on the top and 1 on the bottom."

Repeat the process until you have sawed off as many pieces as you want. Hold the twig against the hook, but keep your fingers away from the slit so that you don't accidentally nick them. A basic hand saw will do the job just fine here. If you don't have access to a saw, try using a pair of heavy-duty gardening shears instead."

Outdoors would be the best, but if it\u2019s rainy or humid where you live, leave the baking sheet indoors. The beads are shaped like cylinders at this point. Set them down on 1 of the flat sides so that they don\u2019t roll around. This is only necessary for fresh twigs that are still wet or green on the inside.

Turn the dremel on and apply a light, downward pressure. Continue drilling until the bit comes out of the other side of the bead, making a complete hole. You can use a larger or smaller drill bit, but you'll have to get an Allen key in the exact same size. If you are making more beads, drill holes through the rest of the beads. If you're worried about injuring yourself, pull on a pair of work gloves or hold the bead between a pair of pliers."

Remove the drill bit and replace it with the longer part of the Allen key. It doesn't matter which side is sticking out: the cut side or the uncut side. An Allen key is shaped like the letter \"L.\" It has a long arm and a short arm. Saw the short arm off and keep the long arm. The Allen key must be the same size as your drill bit, or it won't fit into the bead. If it's even slightly smaller, it can result in the bead flying off!"

Shaping and Finishing the Beads Turn the dremel on and run the bead across 120-grit sandpaper. Wrap a piece of 120-grit sandpaper around a wooden board.

Make sure that you're placing the curved part of the bead against the sandpaper, not the flat part. Continue to sand the bead until you get the diameter you want.

It\u2019s best to sand multiple beads in a single batch. This way, you can ensure that they're all the same size. Adjust the angle of the sandpaper to shape the edges of the bead. Take the sandpaper off the board and fold it in half. Hold it at an angle against the bead and turn the dremel back on.

Smooth the bead with 320-grit sandpaper. Fold a sheet of 320-grit sandpaper in half. Turn the dremel on, then move the bead back and forth across the sandpaper. Do the sides of the bead first, then the top and bottom edges. Follow the exact same process and angles as you did when shaping the bead.
