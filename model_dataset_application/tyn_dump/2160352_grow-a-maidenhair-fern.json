          "description":"A north-facing windowsill is usually a good place to keep a maidenhair fern, as the fern won't receive much direct light. An east-facing window also works, since morning light is more gentle. If you keep the fern at a south- or west-facing window, keep it 1 foot (30 cm) away from the sill, since the direct sunlight can singe its delicate leaves. Light is the most important factor in keeping your fern alive and happy. You can also grow maidenhair ferns under fluorescent grow lights in terrariums. If your maidenhair gets direct sunlight, be extra-vigilant about watering it, as it will dry out more quickly."

Water the plant evenly on all sides as often as daily. To check if your maidenhair fern needs water, lift the pot. If it is half as heavy as when it is freshly watered, it's time. Remember that air conditioning or heat can both dry out the soil. If you have the air or heat on, you'll need to water your fern more often. Check if your maidenhair fern needs to be watered every day."

Don't worry too much if the temperature drops temporarily, but make sure to warm your fern up as soon as you can."

If you aren't able to run a humidifier, be sure to check the soil vigilantly, as it may dry out quickly without it. Alternatively, try keeping the fern in a bathroom where the steam from the shower will keep it moist.
