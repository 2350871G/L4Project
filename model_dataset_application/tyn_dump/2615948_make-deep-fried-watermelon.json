  "text":" Deep fried watermelon Cut the watermelon in half, down its length. Then cut each half in half, again cutting down the length. Place the four wedges on a board for cutting. Cut off the rind from each wedge. Keep this rind for deep fried rind below. Cut the watermelon into slices about 2.5cm/1 inch thick. Then cut each slice into cubes, sticks or triangles. You might even go fancy and use a cookie cutter to cut out special shapes like stars or sheep. Prepare the batter. Beat the egg whites. Add the cornstarch and water to the beaten eggs and whisk together well. When it's smooth, it's ready to dip with. Heat oil in a deep fryer. Heat to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. Roll each watermelon piece in the flour, to coat.  Dip the watermelon pieces into the batter. Cover completely with batter. Place the dipped pieces into the deep fryer. Don't add too many at once or they won't fry properly. About 3-4 pieces at a time is a good amount. Fry until the batter turns golden brown.
