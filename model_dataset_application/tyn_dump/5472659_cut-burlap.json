  "text":" Mid-fabric cutting Place the burlap fabric on a flat surface. Ensure that there is plenty of space for cutting, unimpeded by other things. Work out where it is you want to cut the fabric. If needed, use a measuring tape or a ruler. Find a vertical thread that is placed exactly where you want to cut the fabric.  Stick a needle, crochet hook, or other slim tool under this particular thread. Only catch this thread; leave all of the others in place. Pull this thread up and away from the rest of the burlap fabric. Continue pulling it out with the tool. You will notice the fabric begins to bunch up; this is normal. Keep pulling with the tool until there is enough thread free to grab with your hand. Then use your hand to pull the thread right out. Once the thread has been pulled out, re-lay the fabric on the flat surface. Press down to smooth out the bunching up that occurred while removing the thread. You will now see that there is an area clear of vertical threading. Using sharp scissors, cut straight down this free space created in the burlap. You'll find that it cuts clean without fraying. Sew the edges to prevent unraveling. Use zigzag or another reliable stitch to prevent fraying along the edges of the cut fabric pieces. It's now ready to use for your craft project. (Skip this step if your project instructions require different stitching or processing.) Edge neatening cut Select the last edge thread along where you want to cut. This is the \"edge line\". Pull the chosen thread out. This will usually need to be done by pulling away at it from the open edge at various points until it comes out. Snip the thread line if needed, then pull from where it has been snipped. Once the thread has been pulled out, there will be an edge with only horizontal threads and no vertical pieces. Cut along it now to neaten the edge. Sew the edges to prevent unraveling. Use zigzag or another reliable stitch to prevent fraying along the edges of the cut fabric pieces.
