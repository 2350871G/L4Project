Don\u2019t wash the mushrooms before refrigerating them, or they will absorb too much water and can deteriorate. Cooking the Mushrooms with Flour and Butter Toss the mushrooms in flour. Place a bowl of flour on your work surface. Wipe a mushroom with a damp paper towel. Coat the mushroom with flour by dipping and rolling it in the bowl. Set the coated mushroom aside. Repeat this for each mushroom. Add mushrooms to a skillet with melted butter. Place a skillet over medium heat. Add butter or margarine and allow it to melt. Then pour in the mushrooms. Sautee the mushrooms for three to four minutes. Occasionally stir them gently as they cook. The mushrooms are done when they are golden brown in color. Serve the mushrooms and store the leftovers.
