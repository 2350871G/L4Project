Take a whisk or a fork and beat the eggs until the mixture is a uniform yellow color. Whisk for at least 10 seconds so the omelette is consistent in texture.

Use your favorite oil, such as vegetable, sunflower, canola, or olive oil. The oil prevents the butter from burning in the skillet. If you prefer, you could use all butter or all oil instead."
