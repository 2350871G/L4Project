Pour the scalded milk on top of the dry ingredients, then stir or whisk the contents together until smooth. To prepare the scalded milk, heat it on the stove or in the microwave until small bubbles form around the edge of the dish. Steam may develop, but you should not allow the milk to reach a rolling boil. Allow the milk to cool to a lukewarm temperature before adding it to the dry ingredients."

          "description":"Cover the jar and let it stand for 8 to 12 hours in a warm place away from any drafts. Ideally, the starter should be kept at a temperature around 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). Place the jar in your oven with the heat off, but turn the oven light on. Note that you may need to turn the light on up to two hours ahead of time to get the oven adequately warm. Alternatively, try wrapping a kitchen towel around the jar and placing it in a paper bag.

Continue until you've blended in at least 4 cups (1 L) of flour, then knead the flour in the bowl until it forms a stiff, cohesive, and elastic dough. Bread flour and all-purpose flour will both work for this recipe, but note that bread flour will create a denser product. You can add up to 5 cups (1.25 L) of flour total if the dough seems too sticky with less, but adding too much can make the dough too dense."

If working with large portions instead of individual portions, you'll need to use the rolling pin. Ideally, the dough should be rolled out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch (6 mm), but you can leave the dough as thick as about 3/4 inch (2 cm) if desired.

For bread 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick, bake it for about 13 to 14 minutes. Bread as thick as 3/4 inch (2 cm) may need 15 to 20 minutes. Watch the bread carefully as it bakes.

    "Make sure that the total loaf pan volume can hold 8 cups (2 L).",
    "To further prevent sticking, consider lightly dusting the bottom of the pan with a little flour after greasing it.",
    "You may also use parchment paper, but using aluminum foil since the foil can cause quicker browning and uneven cooking for this recipe.",
    "Combine the flour and sugar.",
    "In a large bowl, mix together the flour and sugar until evenly combined.",
    "Depending on your personal sense of taste and the lemon-lime soda used, you may need to alter the amount of sugar.",
    "If you have a notably sweet soda or prefer blander bread, cut the sugar back by 1 Tbsp (15 ml).",
    "If you have a mild soda or strongly prefer very sweet bread, consider adding another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar.",
    "Mix in the lemon-lime soda.",
    "Pour the carbonated soda over the dry ingredients and mix well using a mixing spoon or clean hands.",
    "Lightly knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together.",
    "Note that the dough will likely be somewhat lumpy.",
    "Do not attempt to knead out all the lumps since over-mixing the dough can cause problems with the finished texture.",
    "For a blander bread, consider using club soda instead of lemon-lime soda.",
    "You can experiment further by using different flavors of carbonated soda, but each different flavor will have a different effect on the final taste of the bread.",
    "Form the loaf.",
    "Transfer the dough into your prepared loaf pan.",
    "Use your hands to spread it out evenly over the entire pan.",
    "Pat on the top surface to flatten it out.",
    "If using two loaf pans instead of one, evenly divide the dough between the two.",
    "Bake for 45 to 60 minutes.",
    "Place the filled loaf pan in the oven and bake the bread until the top turns light golden-brown.",
    "This will usually happen after 45 minutes, but some ovens may require additional bake time.",
    "Serve.",
    "Remove the finished bread from the oven.",
    "After 10 minutes, remove the loaf from the pan and allow it to continue cooling on a wire rack.",
    "Enjoy slightly warm to room temperature.",
    "The finished bread will be somewhat crumbly and chewy, with a flavor somewhat reminiscent of homestyle biscuits.",
    "You can slice it thin or thick."
