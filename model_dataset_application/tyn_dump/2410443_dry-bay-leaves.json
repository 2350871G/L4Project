    "Place the bay leaves onto a baking sheet.",
    "Use a clean baking sheet that\u2019s large enough to accommodate all of the leaves.",
    "Place them so each leaf has at least \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) of room to ensure even drying.",
    "Make sure the baking sheet has no oils or non-stick sprays on it because that will inhibit the drying process.",
    "Place the baking sheet on the lowest rack of your oven.",
    "The rack closest to the heating element is the best location for browning and crisping.",
    "In this case, you want the bay leaves to be nice and crispy.",
    "If your oven has known cool or hot spots, be prepared to rotate the tray during the drying process.",
    "Take out any other baking sheets that might be in your oven because they\u2019ll affect the heat and air circulation.",
    "Leave them in the oven for 30 minutes before flipping the leaves.",
    "Turn each bay leaf over to ensure each one gets dried evenly.",
    "Use oven mitts to carefully remove the baking tray from the oven or to slide it out so you don\u2019t have to put your hand inside the oven.",
    "Grab each leaf by the stem and carefully flip them over.",
    "If you\u2019re leaving the door open, rotate the entire tray so the leaves that were toward the front of the oven are now toward the back.",
    "Wait 45 minutes before checking the leaves for dryness.",
    "Wear an oven mitt to slide the tray out of the oven and use your fingers to feel each leaf.",
    "If you can bend the leaves without them breaking, leave them in the oven for an additional 15 to 30 minutes before checking again.",
    "If the leaves are brittle and break apart when you touch them, take them out and let them cool on the counter.",
    "Turn off the oven once they\u2019re crispy and dry.",
    "Drying bay leaves in the oven typically takes around 1 hour, but it could take longer if you live in a humid environment.",
    "Once they\u2019re dry, shut the oven off and let them cool on the tray for about 1 hour.",
    "If the leaves look discolored and feel extremely brittle, turn off the oven and use oven mitts to transfer the tray to the countertop so they can dry without added heat.",
    "Pull off the stems and store the leaves in a sealed container or zipper bag.",
    "Pull the stems away from the leaves and toss them into your garden or compost bin.",
    "Transfer the leaves into an airtight container or zipper bag.",
    "When stored properly, dried bay leaves will keep their flavor for years!",
    "You can use dried bay leaf for up to 3 years, but their flavor and scent will diminish over time.",
    "You can crush the leaves right away, but they\u2019ll lose their flavor faster.",
    "If you\u2019re cooking right away, go ahead and use them\u2014just note that a little bay leaf goes a long way!",
    "Using a Microwave Line a microwavable plate with a paper towel.",
    "Do not use paper towels made from recycled paper because they contain small fragments of metal that might ignite in the microwave.",
    "You can also use a clean kitchen towel.",
    "If you use a kitchen towel, make sure it doesn\u2019t contain any metal tags as these can ignite in the microwave.",
    "Place the leaves onto the towel before covering them with another towel.",
    "Lay the bay leaves onto the paper towel so none of them are touching.",
    "Then cover them with another paper towel.",
    "If you\u2019re using a large kitchen cloth, fold it over instead of using a separate towel to cover them.",
    "Microwave the leaves on high power for 35 to 45 seconds.",
    "Bay leaves contain lots of oil, so they need adequate time to dry out but not so much that they\u2019re burned.",
    "Setting it to 35 seconds is recommended for standard (1000 watt) microwaves.",
    "Depending on your microwaves, cut the time down to 30 seconds or increase it to 50 seconds.",
    "Don\u2019t microwave the leaves for over 70 or 80 seconds\u2014they\u2019ll probably burn!",
    "Separate the stems from the leaves and store them in an airtight container.",
    "The bay leaves are fully dried when they\u2019re crisp and brittle.",
    "If they still feel soft or if they can bend without breaking, microwave them 10 to 20 seconds at a time before checking again.",
    "If your bay leaves are brown and smell burned, toss them and try it again with a fresh batch.",
    "Whole bay leaves retain their flavor longer than crushed bay leaves."
