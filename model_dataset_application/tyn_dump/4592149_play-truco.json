    "Deal the cards for the next round if you won the previous hand.",
    "The person who wins the hand deals the next round and is the \u201cleader.\u201d Because minimal points are won during each hand, there are plenty of opportunities for everyone to become the dealer at some point.",
    "Even though the hands go quickly, do take a minute to reshuffle the cards before each round.",
    "Keeping Score and Winning Use dry beans to keep score in the traditional way.",
    "Keep a small bowl of 30 beans on the table and appoint 1 person from each team to be their team\u2019s official scorekeeper.",
    "At the end of each trick, have the scorekeeper take beans from the bowl to represent your team\u2019s score.",
    "Keep these beans in front of the scorekeeper on the table to that everyone can see the tallies.",
    "If you don\u2019t have dry beans, you could use other small tokens.Tip: If you\u2019d rather just keep score with pencil and paper, that is okay, too!",
    "Just appoint one person to be the official scorekeeper instead of having 1 person from each team.",
    "Complete the first half of the game by getting 15 \u201cbad\u201d points.",
    "In the game of Truco, the total points you need to win (30) are divided in half.",
    "The first 15 points are called the \u201cbad\u201d points.",
    "Once you cross 15, all your points automatically transfer to \u201cgood\u201d points, or \"buenas.\"",
    "This distinction is somewhat arbitrary because the first person to 30 points wins.",
    "If the game ends and you only have \u201cbad\u201d points, that doesn\u2019t change anything in future games.",
    "Start earning \u201cgood\u201d points once you have more than 15.",
    "After you cross the threshold of 15 points, you\u2019re on your way to winning the game!",
    "It\u2019s possible for both teams to have \u201cgood\u201d points at the same time, but the first one to get to 30 will be the winner.",
    "Win the game by getting 30 points.",
    "Some groups will play the best out of 3 games, prolonging the time spent playing.",
    "Others will just play to 30 and declare that the team who won that game is the ultimate winner.",
    "Feel free to make adjustments to how you and your friends play.",
    "For example, you could decide to play to 15 points if you have an abbreviated amount of time available; or you could decide to play to 100 points\u2014it\u2019s up to you.",
    "If both players cross 30 points in the same hand, the team with the highest score wins.",
    "Deal with a tie by playing more hands until someone pulls ahead.",
    "It\u2019s possible that you and your opponents could both cross 30 points in the same hand and end with the same score.",
    "If this happens, play another hand (and then another, if needed) until one team gains more points than the other.",
    "That team is the winner!",
    "Having a tie is pretty unusual.",
    "Chances are, you won\u2019t run into this situation very often."
