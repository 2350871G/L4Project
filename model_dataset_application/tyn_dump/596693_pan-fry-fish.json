Coat each side of both fillets with the seasoned flour, and use your fingers to press the fillet into the mixture so it evenly adheres.

For example, consider adding a 1/4 tsp (0.78 g) of onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and oregano for a tangy, earthy flavor, or mix in some cornmeal with the flour to give the coating a grittier texture."
