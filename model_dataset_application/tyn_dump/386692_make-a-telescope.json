  "text":" Making a Telescope with Magnifying Glasses Gather all your materials. You'll need a piece of corrugated paper that is about 24 inches in length (this is a ridge material, easily available from paper stores or craft stores). You'll need two magnifying glasses that are NOT the same size. You will also need strong glue, scissors, and a pencil. If the magnifying glasses are the same size, the telescope won't work. Hold one magnifying glass (the bigger one) between you and the paper. The image of the print will look blurry. Place the second magnifying glass between your eye and the first magnifying glass. Move the second glass forward or backward until the print comes into sharp focus. You will notice that the print appears larger and upside down. Wrap the paper around one of the magnifying glasses. Mark the diameter on the paper with the pencil. Make sure that it is pulled tight. Measure along the edge of the paper from the first mark. You will need to measure about 1 1/2 inches from the mark. This will create the extra length to glue around the magnifying glass. Cut down the marked line on the paper to the other side. You should be cutting across the width of it (don't cut lengthwise). The paper should be about 24 inches in length on one side. Cut a slot in the cardboard tube near the front opening about an inch (2.5 cm) away. Do not cut all the way through the tube. The slot should be able to hold the large magnifying glass. Cut a second slot in the tube the same distance from the first slot as was written down between the two glasses. This is where the second magnifying glass will go. You should now have two lengths of corrugated paper. One piece should be slightly larger than the other. Place the two magnifying glasses in their slots (big one at front, little one at back) and tape them in with the duct tape. Leave about 0.5 - 1 inch (1 - 2 cm) of tube behind the small magnifying glass and cut off any excess tube remaining. Glue first length of paper around one of the magnifying glasses. You'll need to glue the edges of the paper together as well, since you've left about 1 1/2 inches of paper. Make the second magnifying glass tube. This one will need to be slightly bigger than the first one. Not too much bigger, only so that the first will fit into the second one. Slot the 1st tube into the 2nd. You can now use this telescope for looking at things farther away, although it will be difficult to view the stars clearly. This type of telescope is really good for viewing the moon.
