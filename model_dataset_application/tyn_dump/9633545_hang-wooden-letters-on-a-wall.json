Use a drill head that can create holes larger than the nail you plan on hanging your letter from. The thicker the letter, the deeper the holes should be. If your letter came with pre-drilled holes, skip this step. If your letter is symmetrical, drill 1 or more holes near the top center of the object. If your letter is not symmetrical, in addition to a hole near the top center of the object, drill holes in any areas where the weight is strangely distributed, such as the bottom hook on a \u2018J.\u2019"

  "text":" Mounting a Wooden Letter with Nails Mark the spot on your wall where you want to hang the letter. Press your letter to the wall and move it around until you\u2019re happy with the position. Then, mark the top center edge of the letter with a pencil or the corner of a sticky note. To avoid spatial conflicts, make marks for every letter you intend to put up before hanging anything. Drill small holes in the back of your letter if necessary.

Leave enough of the nail exposed that you can easily hang your letter on it. Repeat this for each mark. For heavier letters, try using wall anchors instead of nails. Hang your letter on the nails.

If you\u2019re putting up multiple letters, make marks for each before hanging anything up to avoid issues with spacing. Choose an adhesive based on the size and weight of the letters.

Hanging a Wooden Letter Using Ribbon Make marks on your wall where you want your letter and ribbon to sit. Press your letter onto the wall at the spot you want to hang it from. Adjust the letter until you\u2019re happy with the placement, then mark the top center edge of it with a sticky note or pencil. Using the same method, mark the position directly above your letter where you want the top of your ribbon to sit. Find the distance between the 2 marks. Using a tape measure, find the distance between the ribbon mark and the letter mark. The tape measure should go from just below the letter mark to just above the ribbon mark. Cut out a piece of ribbon just over twice as long as your measurement. With your tape measure as a guide, stretch out a piece of ribbon that is twice as long as the distance between the 2 marks. Before cutting, pull out an extra 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to account for the fact that you\u2019ll be attaching the ribbon to the back of the letter, not the top edge. Then, cut the ribbon off the spool using scissors. Fix the ribbon to the back of your letter using hot glue. With a glue gun, place 2 patches of hot glue on the back of your letter. Make sure the patches are spaced evenly apart. Then, press the ends of your ribbon onto the glue, creating a loop. Let the glue dry for 1 to 2 minutes. Hammer a nail into the ribbon mark. Grab a nail strong enough to hold your letter; for most letters, a 4D or 6D nail will be more than enough. Then, place it directly over the ribbon mark and gently hammer it into the wall. Leave a portion of the nail exposed so you can hang your ribbon from it. Hang your ribbon from the nail. Place the center of your ribbon loop over the nail. Let it sit for a few minutes to make sure both the hot glue and nail are sturdy enough to hold your letter. If the letter doesn\u2019t hang where you want it to, try adjusting the ribbon or moving the nail. If the nail can\u2019t support your letter, try replacing it with a strong screw or wall anchor.",
