This prevents the caulk from running down your walls. Tape is great at protecting areas where two surfaces, such as the wall and ceiling, meet. You can caulk without tape, but caulking is often a messy process unless you have plenty of practice."

You can do this with a strong pair of scissors or sharp knife, or you can use the cutter on your caulk gun if it has one. Hold the tube straight up in the air. Hold the scissors level with the ground but don\u2019t cut. Instead, move the handle down so the scissors are halfway between the ground and their original position. This 45\u00b0 cut is commonly used in all caulking projects. Keep the hole small, about a fourth of an inch (.6 cm) wide. Remember, it\u2019s better to cut a little bit off and widen the hole than it is to cut too much off at once. You can make your cut at a different angle. Do what feels comfortable for you and makes your project easier."

Push the object into the hole you made. There\u2019s a foil seal in the tube and you\u2019ll feel it pierce. Keep the hole small so that a lot of caulk doesn\u2019t come out at the same time as you work."

The old caulk should be removed first or else the new caulk won\u2019t stick. The crack you caulk should be no bigger than three-eighths of an inch (about one centimeter).
