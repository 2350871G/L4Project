Once they have the card ask them to memorize it and place it on top. Insist that they don\u2019t let you see the card, but tell them to show others if they want. Cut the deck in half. Place the bottom half on top of the card placed on top. This puts the card you memorized directly on top of their card. You can do as many cuts as you want, as long as they are single cuts. Look through the cards. Pretend to look for jokers and take them out, but also find the card you memorized. Their card is resting directly on top of it.

Ask a member of the audience to pick a card anywhere in the deck. Once they pick a card have them memorize the card. Ask them to show others, but tell them not to show you. Have the audience member place the memorized card on the top of the deck. Cut the deck. Fan the deck out and ask the participant to tell you when to stop. When they say stop, split the deck. From whatever part you stopped at, take the bottom half and place it on top of the deck. Now their card is between both Jokers. Use the magic words. Ask the contestant to wave their hand over the deck and say \"Jokers find my card.\" Now flip the cards over and fan the cards out. Their card should be right in between the Jokers. Pick up their card and ask if this is their card. Performing the Twin Towers Prepare the deck. Separate all the black cards from the red cards into two separate piles.
