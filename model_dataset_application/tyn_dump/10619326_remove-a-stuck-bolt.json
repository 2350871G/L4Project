This will effectively lengthen your wrench by 2 feet (0.61 m) and will give you more torque when you try to remove the stuck bolt.You can find hollow metal bars at large hardware or home-improvement stores. Look for a bar that has a hollow inner diameter of at least \u20444 in (19 mm). If you like, bring your box-end wrench with you to the hardware store to make sure its handle fits inside of the metal bar you choose. Be aware that using a hollow bar to increase the torque of your wrench may damage or snap the wrench."

With your other hand, grip the nut with a large pair of pliers. Pull sharply on the end of the wrench to try to loosen the stuck bolt. Ideally, the penetrating spray will have weakened the bolt\u2019s resistance so that it loosens.If it\u2019s too awkward to hold both the wrench and pliers at once, ask a friend or family member to help you by holding the pliers."

Vice-grip pliers have teeth on the inside of their rounded jaws and can be fastened tightly around the flat surfaces of a stripped bolt.You should be able to slip a hollow piece of metal over the end of vice-grip pliers just as you would over any other wrench."
