    "For instance, if you\u2019re creating a zig-zag shape, you\u2019ll need to rip away multiple short strips of tape.",
    "If you\u2019re painting the pot in 2 simple colors, you only need 1 long piece of tape to encircle the entire pot.",
    "Tie twine around the center of your pot if you don\u2019t want to use tape.",
    "Measure the circumference of your pot to determine the base length of your twine.",
    "Once you have this measurement on hand, add a minimum of 6 in (15 cm) to the existing length.",
    "Cut your piece of twine and wind it around the pot, using the extra section of string to tie your twine into a nice bow.",
    "If you want to better secure your twine into place, consider using hot glue.",
    "For a fun decorative scheme, try wrapping the twine around the pot several times before tying it into place.",
    "Try using a thick chalk paint instead of thin acrylics.",
    "Opt for a thick chalk paint to cover your clay pot instead of traditional acrylics.",
    "Using a foam brush or sponge, paint over the clay surface and inner rim with this specialized paint as your base layer.",
    "Once the paint is dry, try drawing over the surface with chalk.",
    "Now, you can leave fun messages and notes on your pots!",
    "You can add a second layer of chalk paint, if necessary.",
    "Chalk paint can be useful if you need to label herbs, flowers, and other plants.",
    "Cover your pot with fabric instead of paint.",
    "Lay out a piece of fabric that\u2019s large enough to surround your pot.",
    "After laying the material pattern-side-down onto a flat surface, use a foam brush to apply a thin layer of craft glue to the lower half of the pot.",
    "Arrange the fabric carefully around the container, applying glue in sections and pressing the fabric into place around the pot.",
    "Apply glue to the inner rim of the pot, and attach 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of fabric to this portion.",
    "Mod Podge is safe to use on clay and terracotta pots."
