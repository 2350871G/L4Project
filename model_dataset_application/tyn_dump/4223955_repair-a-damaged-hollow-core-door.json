          "description":"Depending on how the door was damaged, there may be some loose splinters or fragments around the edges of the hole or crack. Rather than trying to repair these, use a utility knife to cut away any damaged wood until you\u2019re left with a clean hole free from rough edges. Always cut away from yourself when working with a utility knife, especially when cutting through something sturdy like wood. You may need to make the hole or crack bigger before you can begin repairing it. It\u2019s much easier to repair a larger hole free from damaged wood than it is to repair a smaller one that\u2019s fragmented or broken."

          "description":"While the paper towels won\u2019t make the door stronger or repair it, they are an easy and affordable way to hold the insulation foam in place while it dries. Bunch up a few paper towels and stuff them around the bottom and sides of the hole or crack you want to repair. Paper towels work as they are light enough to hold their own weight inside the door. If you don\u2019t have paper towels, use some tissue paper or something similarly light."

The foam will expand to fill the space inside the door, with any excess expanding outside the hole through the face of the door. Expanding insulation foam should be available online or from your local hardware store. For a smaller space, a low-expansion type may be easier to handle."

Leave the foam to sit for 4 to 5 hours or ideally overnight so that it can dry completely. Check the instructions on your own brand of insulation foam for more guidance on how long it will take to dry."

Use the edge of a putty knife to smear and press the mixture over the hole, filling in any gaps and making it roughly flush with the door. Auto-body filler is a compound that will give you a very strong door, but it can be quite difficult to work with. It will normally come packaged with a hardener catalyst designed specifically to activate it. This product is available online or at your local hardware or auto store."

Work in long, smooth strokes to smear the spackle over the door as smoothly and evenly as possible. Spackle is readily available, affordable, and very easy to work with. Spackle is available online or from your local hardware store."

Use a screwdriver to remove the hardware from the door. You might need to remove the doorknob, hinges, or a strike plate near the base of the door. If you want to remove the door from its hinges entirely, press a nail against the base of each hinge pin and use a hammer to pop out the pins. This will let you refinish the door elsewhere and make the job easier. Check the screws in each fitting or fixture to choose the right screwdriver to use.

    "If you can, bring in a sample of the door to help match it \u2014 such as a piece of the door you cut away when first repairing it.",
    "Apply an even coat of paint or wood stain to the entire door.",
    "Use a broad, all-purpose paintbrush or a paint roller to apply a single coat of paint or wood stain to the door.",
    "Paint or stain any grooves or panels first, then paint long, even strokes over the rest of the door to avoid leaving visible lines.",
    "If you\u2019re worried about making a mess, lay down a drop cloth or some old newspaper underneath the door before you begin painting.",
    "Leave the door to dry for 3 to 4 hours.",
    "Once you\u2019ve applied the first coat, allow the door to dry for 3 to 4 hours.",
    "Even slight contact with the door can damage the finished look, so make sure everyone who might come in contact with it knows that it is still wet.",
    "Check the instructions on your chosen paint or stain for more information on the expected time it takes for it to dry.",
    "Apply a second coat of paint or wood stain and let it dry.",
    "Each coat that you apply to the door will darken the color slightly and improve the look overall.",
    "Once the first coat has dried, apply a second coat to help obscure any imperfections visible from the first coat.",
    "Leave it to dry fully until the door is no longer damp or tacky to the touch.",
    "Many interior paints and stains will take several days to cure completely.",
    "Be careful with your repaired door for 1 week after painting it to avoid damaging your coat of paint.",
    "You can apply as many coats of paint or stain as you want, but 2 or 3 coats will normally be plenty to make your door look fantastic."
