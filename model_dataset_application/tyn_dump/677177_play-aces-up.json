In this game, aces have the highest value, followed by Kings, Queens and Jacks. After the face cards, the numbered cards have descending value, with two being the smallest card.

If an ace of any suit comes out of the stock and you end up with an empty space to put it on, move it right away. The goal of the game is to have only the aces remaining on the tableau, so they'll need to be on the bottom spaces."
