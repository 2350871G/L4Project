Also avoid rocks with stones with lots of small pits on the surface, as these will not polish well. If this is your first time polishing stones, it may be challenging to find high-quality stones on your own.

          "description":"You will want to start with softer stones, as these are easier to shape and polish, and will take less time and work on your part. Softer stone types include: onyx, calcite, limestone, dolomite, or fluorite. Stones are ranked on hardness on the \u201cMohs hardness scale,\u201d which ranks from 1 (very soft)\u201310 (very hard). Most of the stones listed above are a 3 or 4 on the Mohs scale."

If the scrape mark is gritty or white, the stone is too soft\u2014you can still polish it, but its appearance will not improve. If the stone is left with a metallic mark from the knife blade, it is hard enough to polish. Be careful when using a pocket knife, and always scrape the stone with the blade moving away from your body. It doesn't take much pressure to scrape the stone's surface; start with light pressure on the knife, and only increase pressure as needed."

          "description":"Often stones are in awkward or unwieldy shapes; in order to shape the stone to a rounded, symmetrical point, use a hammer and chisel. Especially if you are planning to polish a larger stone, you may want to break off any large protrusions. Since rock dust can be harmful to your lungs and eyes, it's recommended that you wear safety glasses and an air mask while shaping your stones. Once you have chiseled the stone into the desired shape, grind any rough edges against a concrete surface to roughly smooth the edges."

          "description":"You can simply put all the rocks in a bucket of hot soapy water and let them soak for about 30 minutes. This will soften any dirt or material that have stuck onto the stone. Once the stones have soaked, rinse them off. It's necessary to clean excess dirt from stones before you polish them; otherwise, you'll clog up your sandpaper or tumbler with dirt and the stones won't be polished."

If you are going for a nice round stone, start at the corners and rub them down evenly. Once you have your stone shaped like you want, you're ready to use a finer-grain sandpaper. Periodically, dip the stone into your bucket of water to keep the stone wet. 60 grit, 160 grit, and 360 grit sandpaper will all be available from your local hardware store."

A tumbler polishes stones by using the same principles; instead of sandpaper, you will need to add successively finer \u201ctumbler grit\u201d to the tumbler (while the rocks are in the barrel). Although using a tumbler takes much less physical work than polishing by hand, the process takes substantial amounts of time. You'll tumble your stones three times (each with a successively finer grit), and each of these tumbling sessions takes about 7 days. The final polishing step takes 7 days as well.

Powdered stone polish will likely be available at your local hardware store. Polishing powder is often used with dremel tools, so if you're having trouble finding the powder, ask the sales staff if they stock dremels.

Apply the rouge to the denim cloth or leather strip that you used earlier, and then rub it into your polished stones. Be advised that this step is optional. Rouges are often colored, and can stain the tone of your stone. If you apply a rouge, look for a color that already matches that of your stone.
