Rotate the chuck, or end of the drill, to open the jaws that clamp onto the bit. Insert a small drill bit into the end of your power drill, hold the chuck again, and squeeze the trigger to close the jaws and hold the bit in place. Make sure the drill bit is held securely by tugging at it. Use a \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) drill bit or smaller to start."

Fitting the Rivet Nut onto the Mandrel Connect a mandrel and nosepiece that fits your rivet nut to the tool. On a rivet nut tool, the mandrel is a rod that holds the rivet nut in place when you\u2019re securing it to the metal and the nosepiece holds the rivet nut on the tool when you\u2019re installing it.

Screw the rivet nut onto the nosepiece of the mandrel. At the end of the mandrel is a threaded nosepiece. Attach the rivet nut by screwing it onto the end of the mandrel until it\u2019s flush with the end of the tool. You will see the very end of the mandrel inside of the rivet nut. Pull the end of the mandrel back and wind the adjuster. With the rivet nut flush against the end of the tool, pull on the back end of the mandrel. It will slide back a little bit and allow you to turn the adjuster knob to tighten it. Turn the knob until it\u2019s flush against the back edge of the tool. Tighten the knob well so the mandrel is held securely. Securing the Rivet Nut Insert the rivet nut into the hole. Hold the handles of the tool and slide the rivet nut into the hole.
