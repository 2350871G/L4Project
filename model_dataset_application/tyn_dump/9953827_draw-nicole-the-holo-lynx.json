  "text":" Lightly sketch a spherical shape using a pencil on a piece of paper. A perfect sphere is not necessary. Try to do this in the middle of the paper so you have plenty of room, and aren't forced to cut out any limbs. Draw a narrow, upwards-facing triangle on the top of both sides of the circle. These will be her ears. Sketch the guide lines onto the face. One horizontal line going across, and one vertical line going down. They should meet in the middle of the face. Use these lines to help in determining proportions. Sketch the outline of her hair over the head. For a simple look, draw a thin, curvy line starting at the base of the left ear, and ending a few centimeters off the side of the face. Draw a swooping arc across the upper part of both ears and falling down to the near-shoulder area, and close them off. Use the guiding lines drawn earlier to dictate the placement of the eyes, nose and mouth. Her eyes are basic oval shapes, and should align over the horizontal line, equally spaced from the vertical line. The nose should go under the point the lines meet, and the mouth directly below that. Draw two lines going down on the bottom of the head. Curves these down either direction to create her shoulders. On each shoulder, draw a circle. This should be about the width her arms will be. In between both shoulders, draw a larger circle for her torso, and for both shoulders, draw two more circles extending away from them. This will be the skeleton of the torso. Connect the lines to form the basic torso.  Start sketching on Nicole's outfit over the torso. As you extend it downwards, add in Nicole's mid-section and upper legs. Draw on Nicole's hands. Some depictions of Nicole picture her as having more feline-like paws, but she is also drawn with more traditional Mobian gloved hands. Start erasing the guide lines and overlapping lines. The sketch should start to look a bit cleaner. Begin adding facial details. Sketch on her pupils, markings, cheek fur, etc. Add any more final details.
