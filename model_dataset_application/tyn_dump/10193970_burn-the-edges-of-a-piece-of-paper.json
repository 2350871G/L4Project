Spread the water gently with your fingers so the paper doesn\u2019t get too oversaturated or rip. Wetting the corner will let you safely burn the paper without the rest of the sheet catching aflame."

Once it\u2019s lit, move the tip of the lighter under the paper so the flame is barely touching the paper. Keep it there to darken the paper and safely burn it without the sheet catching on fire. You can use a small lighter, but it won\u2019t give you as much control over the flame. Use caution with an open flame and ask a parent for help if you\u2019re younger."

Flip the paper over occasionally to check on the color of the other side. The soot that forms on the other side can be scratched off with a fingernail, so be careful when handling it."

Repeat the process as many times as you need until your paper looks the way you want. Use a fan or a blow dryer to speed up the drying process."
