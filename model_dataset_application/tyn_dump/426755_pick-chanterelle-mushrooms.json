      "description":"The chanterelle grows in many parts of North America. The 'summer' species of the chanterelles are a deep yellow color and are in the shape of a trumpet when full-grown. This makes them quite easy to spot in the forest once you have stumbled upon an area conducive to their growth. The best seasons of the year to hunt the wild chanterelle are late summer and early fall, depending on the amount of rainfall the area has received. Mushrooms must have a good amount of rain in order to grow. So, if your hunting area has had a decent, wet summer, start your search in late August or early to mid September. If you go out and see small chanterelles peeking up from the moss, just give them a couple of weeks to mature, then return to the area to harvest."

      "description":"The poisonous \"look-alikes\" most likely to cause problems are Jack-O'-Lantern mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus. While these are easily distinguished from chanterelles by a sensible observer, carelessness can lead to a nasty set of digestive symptoms. In some locations, lethal Cortinarius species, which have true gills, may have similar orange coloration to the chanterelle. This can lead to dangerous confusion when someone attempts to identify a mushroom based solely on photographs. Chanterelles have deep wrinkles or ridges underneath their caps, but do not have plate-like gills. Omphalotus species have true gills. Note the ridges in this picture. They are thick and not clearly separated. The ridges combine and split, unlike in gills. Chanterelles grow in soil. Omphalotus species grow on decaying wood - but the wood may be buried and almost entirely decayed. Omphalotus species may attain an olive tinge in age, but this is not to be relied upon.
