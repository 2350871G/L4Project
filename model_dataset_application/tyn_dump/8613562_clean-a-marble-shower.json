Ashley Matuska of Dashing Maids says: \"If you just dry your shower walls every day after you use it with a squeegee or a couple of microfiber towels, you will almost completely eliminate the need to have to clean your shower. It's that leftover water that creates soap scum. If you're not doing that, you'll need to clean your shower about once a week to keep mildew and mold away.\""
