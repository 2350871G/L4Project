This allows moisture to percolate down to the roots and makes it easier for the root system to develop. For light, sandy soils, plowing too deeply will allow the moisture to percolate too quickly, and also allow fertilizer to be leached away from your plant's roots."

Make sure there is sufficient moisture in the soil before plowing. The hilling effect of plowing will help build up soil over the plant's root system, keeping more moisture available to them, but plowing in very dry weather will break soil crust and loosen the soil, so any moisture present will evaporate quickly. Plowing just before a rainfall will not kill weeds as effectively, either, since the rain will likely give them an opportunity to re-root before they die. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7f\\/Plow-With-Two-Row-Cultivators-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Plow-With-Two-Row-Cultivators-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7f\\/Plow-With-Two-Row-Cultivators-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/aid372704-v4-728px-Plow-With-Two-Row-Cultivators-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
