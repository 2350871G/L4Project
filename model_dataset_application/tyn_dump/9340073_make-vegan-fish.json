Together, the flavors of these ingredients will give your tofu a rich, salty flavor associated with seafood. Soak tofu strips in the marinade for at least 2 hours. Once your marinade is prepared, transfer your sliced tofu strips to the bowl and make sure they are fully submerged. Allow your tofu to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or even overnight so that the tofu can absorb maximum flavor. Wrap each tofu strip in a small piece of nori paper. Remove your tofu from the marinade, and pat it dry with a paper towel before wrapping each individual strip in a small piece of nori. Use a single sheet of nori paper divided into 6 to 12 equal parts, depending on how you\u2019ve divided your block of tofu. This step will help infuse the flavor of your tofu fish with that of the nori, yielding an even fishier result. Arrange your tofu strips on a lined baking sheet. Place your nori-wrapped tofu pieces on a baking sheet with about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of space between each piece of tofu. Be sure that the nori is wrapped securely around each piece as you arrange them. Bake your tofu fish for 20 minutes at 200 \u00b0C (392 \u00b0F). When your tofu fish is finished, your strips should be golden brown and firm to the touch. When you bite into them, you should note a meaty texture and a mild flavor, reminiscent of seafood. Making Yuba Fish Soak 2 lb (32 oz) of dried yuba sheets in warm water for 6 hours. Place your dried yuba in a large bowl, and cover completely with warm water. Leave the yuba to soak for at least 6 hours. If possible, allow your yuba to soak overnight. Skip this step if you\u2019re using fresh yuba. Drain your yuba in a colander or fine mesh strainer.

Scoop a palm-sized amount of your yuba mixture from the bowl, and use your hands to shape them into flat, round patties. Fry your patties for 4 minutes on each side. Heat a nonstick skillet over a stove set to medium-high heat. Fry your patties 2 at a time for 4 minutes or until they are golden brown. Remove them from the heat when they\u2019re crispy. Preparing Vegan Fish Sticks Drain the liquid from 2 14-oz cans of hearts of palm. Once you\u2019ve removed the water from the cans, pat your hearts of palm dry with paper towels.
