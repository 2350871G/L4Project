If your variety grows large and top-heavy, aim for a sturdy pot that won't tip over. Terra cotta is a good choice. Make sure the pot has drainage holes at or near the bottom. If you're repurposing a container, avoid glass or other materials that you can't add holes to. Varieties with roots that remain close to the soil surface will thrive in a shallow pot. Those with taproots that penetrate deeply into the soil require a taller pot. Read the care instructions that come with your plant (usually on a plastic tab that sticks in the soil) for details."

For indoor plants, choose a window where the plant can get full sun. Don't put your plant in a south-facing window if you live in a hot climate. If you live in a cooler climate, test any south-facing windows for too much heat in the afternoon. The plant can become sunburned with too much sunlight.

When squashed, they leave a red stain. Aphids are about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) long. Their bodies are pear-shaped and can be black, green, yellow, pink, gray, or brown. Scale are small gray bugs.

Watch for impaired growth or limpness, which is evidence of vine weevils or root mealy bugs. Mealy bugs are usually about 2 millimetres (0.079 in) to 3 millimetres (0.12 in) long and resemble lice.

Their bodies are pear-shaped and can be black, green, yellow, pink, gray, or brown. Scale are small gray bugs. They may look like a cluster of small, cottony pinheads. Fight mealy bugs, scale, and aphids with insecticidal soap. Mix a few drops of soap in tepid water. If you have severe infestation, add a few drops of cooking oil to the mixture. Apply it to the affected areas with a cotton swab or spray bottle. You can buy insecticidal soap at your local nursery. For root mealy bugs, remove and discard of the soil.
