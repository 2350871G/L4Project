A simple cheese filling is the most common option for raviolis. However, you can use whatever filling you like for your wonton wrapper raviolis. You can add herbs and spices to the cheese filling, such as basil, thyme, sage, or nutmeg. Meats, such as sausage, chicken, prosciutto, and pancetta, can make tasty ravioli fillings. You may also opt for a seafood filling, such as crab or lobster. Vegetables and greens, such as mushrooms, butternut squash, pumpkin, spinach, and broccoli rabe, work well as ravioli fillings too. You can substitute other cheeses, such as mascarpone or gorgonzola, for the ravioli filling."

You can leave the ravioli as they are in their square shape, or use a medium cookie cutter in a fun shape, such as a heart or star, to cut them out.
