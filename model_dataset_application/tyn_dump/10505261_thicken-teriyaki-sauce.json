If the sauce coats the spoon, this indicates that it will stick well to the ingredients in your meal. Leave the sauce on the spoon for 5 seconds before tasting it to give it a chance to cool. This will help you to be able to taste all the flavours in the sauce and will give you an accurate idea of the consistency of the sauce at a cooler temperature. If the sauce is already at your desired consistency, remove it from the heat."

This helps to evenly spread the mixture through the sauce and help to stop lumps from forming. Leave the sauce on the stovetop while you stir it.
