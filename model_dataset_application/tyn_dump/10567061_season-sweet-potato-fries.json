Place the knife on top of the potato with one hand gripping the handle and the other resting on the top of the blade. Firmly press down to cut the potato into planks about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Now, cut the planks horizontally at the halfway point to make your fries. Always use the palm of your non-dominant hand to apply downward pressure to the knife when cutting. Try to cut your fries into even sizes to ensure consistent baking."
