    "Put \u00bc cup (25 g) of all-purpose flour, 4\u00bd tablespoons (62.5 g) of granulated sugar, \u215b teaspoon (0.5 g) of baking powder, 1\u00bd tablespoons (11.25 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of cinnamon in the mug.",
    "Mix everything together with a fork or mini whisk.",
    "Stir in the wet ingredients.",
    "Pour in 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of canola or vegetable oil and 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of buttermilk.",
    "Add in 1 egg, then 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vanilla extract and \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red food coloring.",
    "Mix everything together with a fork until the yolk breaks.",
    "Keep mixing until the color and texture turn consistent.",
    "If you can't find buttermilk, try sour cream or plain yogurt.",
    "Cook the cake for 50 to 60 seconds.",
    "Place the cake into the microwave and cook it on HIGH for 50 to 60 seconds.",
    "The cake is ready when the center is set.",
    "If the center is not set, then continue cooking the cake at 15-second intervals until it is set.",
    "Place something like a paper plate or paper towel under the mug incase the cake overflows.",
    "Allow the cake to rest for 30 minutes.",
    "This allows the flavors to blend together.",
    "It also gives the cake enough time to cool down so that you can add frosting on top.",
    "You can use this time to prepare the frosting.",
    "Prepare the cream cheese frosting, if desired.",
    "You don't have to make the cream cheese frosting, but it make the cake more flavorful.",
    "To make the frosting, beat together 1 ounce (30 g) of softened cream cheese, 1 ounce (30 g) of softened butter, and 4 to 6 tablespoons (45 g) of powdered sugar until the frosting is light and fluffy.",
    "You can do this with a mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks.",
    "The more sugar you add, the stiffer the frosting will be.",
    "Pipe the frosting onto the cake.",
    "Scoop the frosting into a plastic sandwich bag.",
    "Zip it shut, then cut off 1 corner.",
    "Pipe the frosting onto the cake, then serve it.",
    "You don't have to use all of the frosting.",
    "You can remove the cake out of the mug first, or leave it in the mug.",
    "Use the leftover frosting to fill the cake.",
    "You can use a piping bag and tip instead."
