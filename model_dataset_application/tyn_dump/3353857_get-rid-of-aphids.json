Depending on the species, they may be white, black, gray, green, yellow, or even pink. Some types appear to be covered with a fuzzy, cotton-like substance when viewed up close. There are both flying and wingless species of aphids, making them even more of a nuisance to control. Some will grow wings once their current food source is degraded and fly onto greener pastures. Aphids are a common pest in all parts of the globe, and have been known to infest almost any type of crop, tree, shrub, or flowering plant."

Hose down your plants 1-2 times a day until the infestation starts to thin out. Avoid using a pressure setting high enough to damage the plant itself and refrain from overwatering.

Apply the solution liberally to plants that shows signs of aphid activity. The surfactants in the soap will eventually cause the insects to dry out without affecting the plant. To make your solution even more effective, add a generous pinch of cayenne pepper. Keep your spray bottle in a garage or shed near your garden so you'll always have it when you need it.

Mist your infested plants from leaf to root. Essential oils are naturally repulsive to aphids, so whatever bugs the mixture doesn't kill off will be in a hurry to leave. Not only are essential oils complete safe, they'll also pull double duty as a pleasantly fragrant insect repellent.

The cloying oil will smother the aphids, killing them in a matter of hours. Neem oil can be found at any major gardening center. It's nontoxic and breaks down rapidly once it's exposed to air, so it won't harm you or your plants. As an added bonus, neem oil is also useful against a host of other common pests, including mealy bugs, beetles, and caterpillars.

Look for products proven to be effective against aphids. Some pesticides are sold in convenient spray bottles, while others will need to be mixed and deployed using a chemical sprayer. Keep in mind that chemical insecticides can be damaging to plants and beneficial predator species. Always follow the instructions provided on the product label, and never use more than directed.

You can typically purchase the eggs, larvae, and even live specimens of helpful garden predators at major garden supply stores. Ladybugs and lacewings and can become a nuisance in their own right.

With the right offerings, you can draw helpful ladybugs to your garden without going to the trouble of buying, releasing, and monitoring them on your own. Think twice before pulling out every last weed you find. Leaving a few here and there will help promote diversity in your growing space, and varieties like dandelion and bugleweed are actually attractive to some species of ladybugs.

Their pungent odors are offensive to the insects, who will eventually move on to a different setting in order to get away from it.
