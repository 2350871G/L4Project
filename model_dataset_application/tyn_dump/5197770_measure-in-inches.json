For example, use a measuring stick if you\u2019re trying to measure the length of something with a rigid straight edge. Rulers are best for short distances, while yard sticks are better for objects that are 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91 m) long. Use a tape measure when you need to measure the distance around a curved object. Tape measures can bend, making them better for objects that are not perfectly flat or straight."

When using a measuring stick, the stick should lie flat against the edge or line being measured. When using measuring tape, the tape should wrap around the entire distance being measured. Identify the last full inch your tool is measuring on the object. This is the last numbered value represented on the measuring tool before it reaches the opposite end of the line, edge, or distance being measured. This numbered value is the number of whole inches in the length that you\u2019re measuring. The numbered values on a ruler, yardstick, or measuring tape all correspond to whole inches. The shorter, unnumbered lines in between the numbered values are fractions of an inch. Count the unnumbered lines past the previous full inch value. Identify the unnumbered line on the measuring tool that lands at the exact end of the distance being measured. Then, count the unnumbered lines in between the measured whole inch value and that final line, including the final line itself. Add the fractions you just counted to the full inch value. This will give you the final measurement in inches of whatever you\u2019re trying to measure.

The most common object used to estimate inches is the adult thumb, which is about 1 inch wide. Other options may include a water bottle cap, a detachable pencil eraser, the width of a standard rubber eraser, the length of a paperclip, and the length of a standard small sewing pin.

For example, if you\u2019re using your thumb, lay your thumb horizontally on top of the line, with the bottom end of your thumb aligned with the starting point of the line.

Count the spaces in between lines, not the lines themselves. Make sure that you count the space before the first line and the space after the last line, as well. Converting Other Imperial Measurements to Inches Convert feet into inches by multiplying the number of feet by 12. There are 12 inches in every 1 foot. To convert a measurement taken in feet to its equivalent value in inches, you must multiply the value in feet by 12. For example, if you have a measurement of 5 feet, multiply it by 12 to get a measurement of 60 inches. Calculate inches from yards by multiplying by 36. There are 36 inches in every 1 yard. If you have a measurement taken in yards and you need to know the equivalent number of inches, you would multiply the yard value by 36. For example, if you have a measurement of 2 yards, multiple it by 36 to get a measurement of 72 inches. Find the number of inches based on the number of miles. There are 63,360 inches in every mile. If you are given the length of a distance in miles and need to know how many inches are in that distance, multiply the number of miles by 63,360. For example, if you\u2019re given a distance of 0.5 miles, multiply this by 63,360 to get a measurement of 31680 inches. Converting Metric Measurements to Inches Calculate inches from millimeters by multiplying by 0.03937. Every 1 millimeter is equivalent in value to 0.03937 inches. Multiply a length value taken in millimeters by a conversion factor of 0.03937 to convert that value into inches. For example, if you have a measurement of 92 millimeters, multiply this by 0.03937 to get 3.62 inches. Convert centimeters into inches by multiplying by 0.3937. There are 0.3937 inches for every 1 centimeter. To find out how many inches there are when you know a distance measured in centimeters, multiply the centimeter value by a conversion factor of 0.3937. For example, if you have a measurement of 34.18 centimeters, multiply it by 0.3937 to get a value of 13.46 inches. Determine the number of inches from the number of meters. Every meter is equivalent to 39.37 inches. If a length value has been measured in meters, you can convert it to inches by multiplying that value by a conversion factor of 39.37. For example, if you have a distance of 7 meters, multiple 7 by 39.37 to find the measurement of that distance in inches. In this case, that distance would be 275.59 inches.",

    "If a length value has been measured in meters, you can convert it to inches by multiplying that value by a conversion factor of 39.37.",
    "For example, if you have a distance of 7 meters, multiple 7 by 39.37 to find the measurement of that distance in inches.",
    "In this case, that distance would be 275.59 inches."
