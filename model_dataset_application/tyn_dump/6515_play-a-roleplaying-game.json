If you are making up your own game, it's important to set up some ground rules first so that everybody knows what to do. If you'll be using a rulebook, you can buy them online or at game shops. Sometimes a game will have multiple rulebooks, so ask for recommendations or read online reviews to determine which will be best for your roleplay. If you're making up your own game, think about what kind of limits there should be. Can players rise from the dead, fly, or disappear? If you're playing a fanfiction or historical roleplay, can they act completely different from the original character? Will you allow players to go again or start over with a new character if they've made a mistake? It might be helpful to write the rules down so everyone knows them."
