A toy tumbler won\u2019t have much effect on the rocks, and you probably don\u2019t need a commercial tumbler unless you\u2019re doing very large loads or plan on selling the rocks. Hobby-level tumblers are fine for most needs. Pick one up for $50-$300, depending on the size and model. Tumblers come in sizes ranging from 3 lb (1.4 kg) to over 20 lb (9.1 kg). Unless you have a large rock collection to polish, a smaller one is probably fine. You can buy tumblers online or at hobby stores. If you\u2019re only polishing a few rocks or don\u2019t plan on doing this again, then use a handheld polishing method. You may also be able to rent or borrow a tumbler for a one-time job."

If you don\u2019t have that much agate, then use a filler material to fill the tumbler the rest of the way. Filler material is available for purchase online or at hobby stores. You can place other rocks in the tumbler as well, but make sure they match the hardness of agate to avoid damaging them. Agate is a 7 on the hardness scale, so use other rocks that are a 7 like quartz and jasper. Different rock tumblers may have different instructions on how much to fill. Always follow the instructions that come with your product. Check inside for a fill line."

Scoop in the instructed amount of carbide. The amount of grit to add depends on the size of the tumbler you\u2019re using. Follow the instructions that come with the tumbler for the right measurement. Typical amounts are 3 tbsp (45 g) for a 2 lb (0.91 kg) tumbler, 4 tbsp (60 g) for a 3 lb (1.4 kg) tumbler, and 8 tbsp (120 g) for a 6 lb (2.7 kg) tumbler.

You can also run the tumbler for shorter or longer, depending on what result you want. Grind them longer if they have a lot of built-up grit on the exterior.
