Treat these spots before you move on to hand washing, otherwise, the stain could become a permanent part of your garment. If you're on the go, carry a stain-remover pen with you to treat small spots that show up over the course of the day. If you can, treat a stain as soon as possible. Dab at the stain rather than rubbing, and use cold water to try and rinse it away. This will make it less likely that the stain will become permanent."

Measure \u20444 cup (59 mL) of chlorine or laundry-specific bleach into a bucket, along with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Put your clothes into the bucket and let them soak for 15 to 30 minutes. Once they're done soaking, carefully dump out the bleach, gently wring out your clothes, and wash them as usual. If you've never bleached this particular item before, test the bleach on an inconspicuous location first to make sure it doesn't ruin the fabric (the inside of a cuff or collar is a great spot to try).

Rinse the stained area, repeat the stain-removal process if you need to, and then move on to washing it. When rubbing the stained area, use very gentle pressure.
