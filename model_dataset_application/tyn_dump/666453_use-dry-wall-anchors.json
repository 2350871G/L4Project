They\u2019re designed to be placed directly into the drywall so that you can hang even heavy items without fear of slippage or damage.

If you're only installing a single anchor, you can simply eyeball the reference mark based on the desired height and position of the item you'll be hanging. If you're installing multiple anchors, use a level and tape measure or ruler to ensure that adjacent markings are properly spaced and level."

If it's too small, you may not be able to get the anchor in, or the tight confines could cause it to malfunction. Most drywall anchors have the dimensions clearly labeled on the packaging. Simply note the width of the anchor to determine what size drill bit you need. You want your hole to be slightly smaller than the anchor. When you're installing the anchor, you'll need to lightly tap it into place. If you're unable to find the dimensions of the anchors you're using, you may need to perform a size comparison by holding them up side-by-side with several different bits."

Once you have your pilot hole in place, you can use it to install any type of drywall anchor. If you don\u2019t have an electric drill, you can also make a pilot hole using an awl or hammer and nail-set or nail. As another alternative, you can use a Phillips head screwdriver to make your hole. Press the tip of the screwdriver against the wall, then twist it back and forth to create your hole. Not every type of wall anchor requires a pre-drilled pilot hole, but it\u2019s a helpful first step and can end up saving you time that you might otherwise spend struggling to get an anchor through stubborn drywall by hand."

Assuming you marked the site of each individual pilot hole earlier, this should only take a few extra seconds. Take your time drilling to make sure the job gets done right. Your mounted item might not hang correctly if one or more of the holes have been drilled at odd angles. When hanging very heavy items, such as TVs, make sure you screw into at least one wall stud.

When you insert the included mounting screw, the tip of the anchor will flare out, keeping it from coming out of the drywall. If your expansion anchor starts to turn when you're inserting your screw, you can cut another anchor lengthwise and slide one half of it into the space between the anchor and the side of the hole. As another alternative, you can pull out the anchor and use the next size up. Expansion anchors are the cheapest, most basic type of drywall anchor. They\u2019re best used for hanging lightweight items, such as small framed paintings, paper towel racks, and anything under about 10 lbs. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that expansion anchors are only as strong as the wall they\u2019re installed in. Since drywall is a soft material, there\u2019s a greater chance of the anchor coming loose and pulling free over time."

As their name suggests, self-drilling anchors can also be screwed in with a handheld screwdriver if you don\u2019t happen to have an electric drill handy.
