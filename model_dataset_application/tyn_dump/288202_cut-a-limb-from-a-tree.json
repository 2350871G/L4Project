  "text":" Making Your Cuts Wait until your tree is dormant in the winter to make your cuts. Pruning your tree when it's dormant gives it time to heal before threatening pests arrive. If you have particularly cold winters, wait until the coldest part of winter is over before you prune your tree. Pruning in the winter will also help your tree grow more during the spring. Avoid pruning your tree during the growing season or you could stunt its growth. Use a chainsaw, bow saw, or hand saw to make your cuts.
