Choose from granite, concrete, wood, or laminate as the material for the new counter. Remove your old countertop carefully to keep the base of the island intact. Take measurements carefully and order the new countertop pre-cut to make the installation easier. If this installation seems like too much work to undertake on your own, call local contractors to get quotes for the job."

To add this effect, measure each side of your kitchen island then cut the beadboard to size. Apply heavy duty construction adhesive to the back of the beadboard and press it firmly onto the sides of your island. Let the adhesive dry for at least 3-4 hours before doing any more work on the island. Beadboard can be purchased at hardware stores. Cut beadboard with a table saw, circular saw, or jig saw."

Use a miter saw to cut one end of each baseboard at a 0 degree angle, and the other end at a 45 degree angle. Dry fit the pieces to make sure they interlock properly and glue the baseboard onto the island with heavy duty construction glue. If you end up with gaps between the baseboard edges, use caulking to fill them in."
