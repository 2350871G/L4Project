          "description":"For a ginger plant, it\u2019s best to use a wide, fairly shallow pot. That\u2019s because the plant\u2019s roots grow horizontally rather than vertically. A pot that's approximately 12-inches (30-cm) wide and 12-inches (30-cm) deep is usually a good option for ginger. Make the pot deeper if you are putting gravel in the bottom for better drainage. Make sure that your pot also has good drainage holes, so the roots don\u2019t become waterlogged. You should have a fairly deep saucer to place underneath the pot to catch the water that drains."

          "description":"Once you\u2019ve selected your pot, add potting soil to it. It\u2019s important to choose a soil that drains well so the ginger\u2019s roots remain healthy. Look for a potting soil that contains sand, which provides air space that helps the water drain out more easily. Perlite and vermiculite also help create air space for better drainage, so you can use soil mixes that contains those ingredients as well. An all-purpose soil-free mix is also good for ginger plants because it contains a high amount of organic material, such as peat, but also features sand, perlite, vermiculite, or a combination of all three that helps the soil drain effectively."

If you have a friend or neighbor with a ginger plant, you can also ask for a root cutting. Make sure that the ginger root that you choose is plump and firm. Its skin should be tight with several eye buds on it. Eye buds are similar to the eyes that you\u2019d find on potato."

Cut back on how often you water the plant and check the pot's drainage holes to ensure that they're not blocked.

Move the plant to an area where it doesn't receive direct sunlight and prune away the affected leaves.
