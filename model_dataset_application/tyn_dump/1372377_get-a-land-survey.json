      "description":"There are 6 situations in which a land survey should be performed. Get a survey done if you are buying a new piece of property. The reason is simple: you need to make sure that what you think you're buying is actually what you're buying. Most lenders will require a survey anyway. Get a survey done if you are constructing anything new on your property. Most zoning ordinances and neighborhood codes will specify a required setback from your property line. If you don't know precisely where your property line is, you won't be able to adhere to this regulation. Get a survey done if your property has any access easements. All property owners are entitled to access their property, and this often requires getting easements to allow the use of a neighboring land parcel for access. Easements should specify very clearly the centerline and width of any access corridors. Get a survey done if you are selling your property. Having a current survey on file will greatly improve the marketability of your home. Buyers will be more interested in your property if you give them the confidence that a proper survey has been performed. Get a survey done if you need to verify the acreage of your property for tax assessments. Your local jurisdiction may require you to have a current survey on file to correctly assess property taxes. Get a survey done if your neighbor starts building anything new. If you suspect your neighbor is encroaching on your property or violating setback regulations, you need a survey on your own property to initiate any legal action."
