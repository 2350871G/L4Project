Different types of chocolate will have different percentages of milk and cacao, which will affect the taste and appearance of your hazelnut spread. Milk chocolate has a low percentage of cocoa solids and has a very sweet flavor. It is used in many popular candy bars. This is a good choice if you want your chocolate spread to be sweet, mellow, and not too chocolatey. Semi-sweet chocolate is most often used in chocolate chip cookies. It has less sugar and higher percentage of cocoa solids (40%-60%) than milk chocolate and will give you a rich chocolate flavor. Higher percentages can have a slightly bitter taste. Bittersweet chocolate can have a similar flavor to semi-sweet. It contains little sugar but more chocolate liquor. It usually contains between 60%-85% cocoa solids. This is a good choice if you want a spread that is less sweet, slightly bitter, and very chocolatey. Avoid unsweetened chocolate, which should only be used for baking."

This is a good choice if you want a spread that is less sweet, slightly bitter, and very chocolatey. Avoid unsweetened chocolate, which should only be used for baking. Break the chocolate into pieces and rough chop it. This makes it easier to melt the chocolate later. Always use a sharp knife (more accidents occur with dull knives). Collect the chopped chocolate into a small bowl. If you plan to melt the chocolate in the microwave, make sure it is a microwave-safe bowl. Set the bowl aside to melt when after the hazelnuts are toasted--this will take some time and your chocolate will probably harden again if you melt it now. Toasting the Hazelnuts Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF (176\u00baC). If you don't have an oven, it is possible to toast the hazelnuts on a stovetop. Heat a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Add the nuts (don't use any oil or spray, as the nuts are naturally oily) and stir constantly with a spatula until golden brown. Spread 1 cup hazelnuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Again, don't worry if you don't get every single scrap of skin. Melting the Chocolate Prepare a bain marie (double boiler). This is when you have one pot of boiling water and fit another pot on top. The top pot is where you will put your chocolate. This method heats the chocolate gradually and keeps it from burning. You can also heat the chocolate in a microwave. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the chocolate in 15-second intervals, stirring in between. Heat and stir until the chocolate completely smooth.

Keep an eye on the chocolate, stirring until it is smooth and melted, with no little lumps. Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat once melted. Set it aside and allow it to cool.
