To protect them, change the repellent every week or two. For instance, put up CDs. When bird activity increases, replace them with foil springs.

When birds start to approach again, replace either the visual repellent or the noisemaker. If you only have a couple trees, just hang aluminum cans or other clusters of noisy objects. Anything louder may not be worth the annoyance in a home garden. The cheapest commercial devices are handheld noisemakers that fire a small, loud explosive. These require frequent patrols. To save labor, buy a stationary gas cannon or electric distress signal. Place these above the canopy, one for every 5 acres (2000 square meters)."

The netting will catch against the branches, so hold the netting flat above the tree and lower it. It should cover the entire tree, and hang fairly loosely, since cherries tight against the netting will still get eaten. To protect fruit at the edges, plant stakes around the tree to lift it above the cherries. Top the stakes with upside down milk jugs, which won't tear the netting. Valuable or important fruit can be protected by a full frame around the tree."
