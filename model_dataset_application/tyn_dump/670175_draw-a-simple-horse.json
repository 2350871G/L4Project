Include a gentle curve in towards the horse\u2019s body at the bottom of the line. Make this line about twice as long as the back of the horse\u2019s neck. Forming the Body Draw a line extending from the base of the neck for the horse's back. Ensure that the line is about twice as long as the horse\u2019s neck, and then draw a line that curves down at the end of it. This is the horse\u2019s back and rump. It\u2019s okay if there\u2019s a gentle curve in the line that makes up the horse\u2019s back. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly straight.

Make the lines about the same length as the horse\u2019s chest and rump. Include a slight 30-degree bend in the lines near the center to give the impression of a knee joint. Create a curved line going under the horse for the belly. Make it as long as the horse\u2019s back. Make the line curved enough so that the belly looks somewhat full, but not so full that it droops down past the horse's leg joints.

Ensure that the second legs and feet are slightly ahead of the first ones you drew to give the horse\u2019s body depth.
