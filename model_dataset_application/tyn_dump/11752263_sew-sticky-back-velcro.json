Push firmly so the Velcro stays in place.Tip: Trim each corner of the Velcro piece at a 120-degree angle if you don't want the corners to catch on fabric. Sharp edges are more likely to peel up and snag the fabric. You can hand-sew sticky Velcro on most lightweight fabrics such as cotton or polyester. Avoid using denim since it's too thick to stitch by hand. If you only need to sew a little bit of sticky back Velcro, buy small sticky back coins or squares instead of tape."

          "description":"Cut off an 18 to 20 inches (460 to 510 mm) long strand of polyester thread that matches your fabric. Insert the thread through the eye of a heavy-duty sewing needle and tie a knot at the other end of the thread. Buy needles that say they're heavy-duty or made for denim on the package. If you use a thin needle, it's more likely to break as you push it through the tough Velcro pieces."

          "headline":"Straight stitch across each edge of the Velcro.",
          "description":"Push your needle down through the Velcro to create a straight stitch, also called a running stitch. Then, bring it back up through the Velcro to make another stitch. To finish sewing, make a few backstitches and cut the thread. Repeat this process for the opposite piece of the Velcro. Sew as close to the edges as you can when you're doing the straight stitch, so they don't curl up. Keep your stitches as small as possible so the Velcro stays firmly in place. If you want the Velcro to be extra secure, straight stitch diagonally across the piece."

          "headline":"Wipe away adhesive with acetone and lubricate the needle if it begins to stick.",
          "description":"Although it's a lot easier to sew sticky back Velcro by hand, the needle might still become sticky from the adhesive. If it does, stop sewing and wipe the needle with a cloth soaked in acetone or nail polish remover. Then, squirt a few drops of sewing machine lubricant onto another cloth and wipe it on the needle. You may need to repeat this every few stitches or at least for every side you sew."

Position the sticky back Velcro on your fabric and press firmly so it sticks in place. Although sticky back Velcro also comes in small coins or squares, these are too small to sew using your machine. To prevent the Velcro's corners from catching on fabric, trim each corner of the Velcro piece at a 120-degree angle. Since a sewing machine can easily stitch through heavy fabrics as well as lightweight ones, you can sew sticky back Velcro onto most fabrics. Just ensure that you have a strong needle so it doesn't break."

Then, squirt a few drops of sewing machine lubricant onto a soft cloth and wipe it on the needle.Tip: It's important to use a heavy-duty needle since thinner needles may break as you sew. Try using a denim or leather needle if your sturdiest needle isn't working. The package of needles should say \"heavy-duty\" or that they're designed for denim.

Then, adjust the machine's stitch length to make straight stitches between 1.5 and 2.0 millimetres (0.059 and 0.079 in) long. If you make the stitch length longer than this, the needle may skip over the Velcro. Use polyester thread, which is stronger than cotton thread and less likely to break. Don't try to do the zig zag stitch with Velcro since your machine may have a difficult time working back and forth."
