Use stickers if you want the entire object glittered, but a shape un-glittered. Use masking tape to create cold designs, such as stripes and zigzags."

Different brands may have different instructions, but listed below are the basics:\nPut on a pair of vinyl or plastic gloves. Apply the cream using a popsicle stick. Wait 5 minutes. Rinse the cream off in a stainless steel sink. If you have a glaze or porcelain sink, use a bucket instead. Pat the design dry."

This way, the glue won't dry by the time you get around to glittering it. If you want to use more than one color, choose one color to start with. Apply the second coat of glue to the areas with that color first. You'll add the other color(s) after the first one dries.

  "text":" Getting Started Choose your glass object. You can use this tutorial for just about anything made out of glass, including mason jars, cups, and wine glasses. Avoid choosing something that will be going outside or has a lot of sharp/faceted edges, however. Keep in mind that glittered glass tends to be delicate, so something that will be going outside or heavily used is not a good glittering candidate. Clean the glass well with soap and water. Wash the glass using warm water and dish soap. Rinse it off well, then wipe it dry. This will get rid of any surface dust and dirt that might prevent the glue and glitter from sticking. It is a good idea, even for store-bought items that look clean. Wipe the surface down with rubbing alcohol. Soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and wipe down the entire surface. This will get rid of any oil and residue that the regular washing did not get rid of. Any oils left on the glass will prevent the glue and glitter from sticking. Mask off the area you want glittered.

The best type of glue for this would be a glue used for glass and ceramic projects. Decoupage, Mod Podge, and similar types of glue are also popular for these types of projects, but the finished piece will not be as durable. Avoid using tacky glue, school glue, or basic white glue.
