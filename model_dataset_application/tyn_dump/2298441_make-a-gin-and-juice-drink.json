The type of juice you use is really up to you, but tart juices are more commonly used than sweet juices. For a milder taste, consider using pineapple juice, orange juice, pomegranate juice, cherry juice, or grape juice. For a slightly stronger taste, consider grapefruit juice or cranberry juice. You can also combine juices as long as the ratio of gin to juice remains the same. Try mixing grapefruit juice and orange juice, cranberry and grape, or another of your favorite juice combinations. Strong citrus fruits, like lemon and lime, can also be mixed with gin but are generally combined with other ingredients, like syrup or soda water, to dilute the sourness."
