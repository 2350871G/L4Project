If you choose sliced, diced, or smashed, cut your fingerlings now with a clean knife. If you plan on serving them as halves, you can either halve them now or after boiling, when they are softer.

If you are smashing your potatoes, either toss them in the bowl with the butter and seasonings in the bowl first or simply use your masher to mix them in.

Whole potatoes may require a higher temperature of 500 degrees F (260 C) and/or a longer cooking time to make sure the centers cook thoroughly. For smaller pieces, like diced fingerlings, stay closer to 400 (204 C), since these will probably cook faster."

First, peel 1.5 lbs (680 g) of potatoes, if desired. Decide whether to serve them whole, halved, sliced, diced, or smashed. If you choose sliced, diced, or smashed, cut your fingerlings now with a clean knife. If you plan on serving them as halves, you can either halve them now or after boiling, when they are softer.

Set your oven between 400 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit (204 to 260 Celsius). Also, line the bottom of a large roasting pan (or other baking dish) with a tablespoon of olive oil. Prevent scorching or burning once it's time to roast your potatoes. Clean your potatoes. Wash your hands first. Then scrub the skins with your thumbs and fingers under a running faucet. Use water only, without any soap. Wash your fingerlings even if you plan to peel them, since the dirty skins may come in contact with the flesh as you peel them. Peel and cut your fingerlings as desired. For four servings, use 2 lbs. (907 g). Either keep or remove the skins according to your taste. Halve your fingerlings in two, slice or dice them into smaller bits, or leave them as they are to roast them whole. Season your potatoes. Place the potatoes in the pan. Spray or drizzle them with about a tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle seasonings over them. Toss the potatoes in the pan to make sure they are evenly coated with oil and seasonings. Roast them.

After washing your hands, use your thumbs and fingers to clean the potatoes\u2019 skins under running water. Do not use soap. Wash your fingerlings even if you peel them before cooking. This way, your peeler won\u2019t move any dirt or chemicals from the skin to the flesh. Peel and cut them as you like. Skin 1.5 lbs (680 g) of potatoes if desired. Leave them whole or slice or dice them into smaller bits. To serve them halved, you can either slice them now or wait until you have boiled them whole. Once you are finished prepping, transfer the fingerlings to a pot. Let them sit in boiled water. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the potatoes. Place the pot on a burner and boil the water. Once the water boils, switch the burner off. Allow the potatoes to sit in the boiled water as it loses heat. This may take ten or more minutes. Transfer them to a large skillet.

Continue to stir your potatoes up every couple of minutes so the potatoes brown as evenly as possible on all sides. Sprinkle your seasonings over them as you near the end. Stir them up to distribute them evenly over your fingerlings. Turn off the heat and serve. Seasoning Your Potatoes Keep it simple. For a good basic seasoning, use \u00be teaspoon of kosher salt, \u00bd teaspoon of ground black pepper, and \u215b teaspoon of ground red pepper for 1.5 lbs (680 g) of potatoes. Give them an earthier flavor. Use 1 tablespoon of fresh, chopped rosemary or thyme (or \u00bd tablespoon of each), plus salt and pepper to taste, for 1.5 lbs (680 g) of potatoes.
