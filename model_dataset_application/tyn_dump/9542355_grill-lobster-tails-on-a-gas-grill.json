Grilling the Lobster Tails Place the lobster skewers cut side down on the grill. Open the lid of the preheated grill, and place the lobster tails cut side down against the grate. Space the lobsters evenly from one another in the center of the grill for the most even cooking. Lobster tails placed towards the edges may take longer to cook than those placed in the center of the grill. Space the tails a minimum of 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart for the mot even heat. Close the lid and check the lobster tails after 5 minutes. Flip the tails if the shells are bright red. If your tails are not bright red yet, check that your grill is on medium-high heat and cook them until the shells are red, checking at 1-minute intervals. Flip the lobster tails and grill for another 4 minutes. Turn the tails over on the grill, and spoon a tablespoon (14 g) of the herbed butter over the cut meat of each lobster tail. Close the lid of the grill and cook the lobster tails on this side for 4 minutes. Check the lobster for doneness by observing its color. After 4 minutes, open the lid of the grill. The lobster meat should be opaque and white. If it\u2019s still translucent at all, double check the temperature of your grill (it should still be medium-high) and continue cooking until the meat is white and opaque, checking at 1-minute intervals.
