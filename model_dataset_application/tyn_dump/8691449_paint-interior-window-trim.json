Older, solvent based paints should be avoided; these are less environmentally friendly, and give off less noxious fumes before they dry. Acrylic paints are durable and can be easily cleaned. When determining the amount of paint you\u2019ll need to cover your interior window trim, you can use one of many \u201cpaint calculators\u201d online. You can also provide an estimate yourself by measuring the area of your indoor trim. One gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet (32.5 square meters).

A semi-gloss or satin (low-gloss) paint will also help your trim stand out against the surrounding walls, and should be relatively easy to keep clean. Although a high-gloss paint will catch your (and your guest\u2019s) eye, it will only look good on high quality and extremely smooth wood. Unless you\u2019re planning to hire a professional painter for the job, avoid using a high-gloss paint."

The 1.5\u20132-inch (3.8\u20135 cm) width should be a good fit for most window trim, and the stiffness of the bristles will prevent them from splaying while in use, and will allow for precise painting.

You can do this using individual sheets of sandpaper and your hands. There\u2019s no need to use a professional-grade sander. Sand the trim, then rub your fingers along it: the wood should feel completely smooth. Since the paint will adhere optimally to the wooden trim if the trim is smooth and has no scratches, you\u2019ll want to use a fine-grain sandpaper for this step. Your local hardware store will stock sandpaper; look for something around 120\u2013180 grit."

This papery tape is only mildly adhesive on one side, so can be applied on any wall without stripping paint off. Be sure to place the painter\u2019s tape close against the sides, top, and bottom of the window trim. If you\u2019re concerned about dripping paint onto the floor (especially if it\u2019s carpeted), you could also lay down a sheet of plastic beneath the window.
