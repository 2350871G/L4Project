  "text":" Making the Dough In a large mixing bowl, stir yeast and honey into warm water. If you have a stand mixer, that's best. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes or until bubbles form on the surface and the mixture begins to foam. These are the signs to look for to know that the yeast is doing its job. Pour in salt, oil and half the flour. Mix it well, and once that flour is fully combined, start adding the rest of the flour in bit by bit until you get the stromboli dough to the consistency you want. It should be a little tacky, but when you touch it nothing should stick to your fingers. Using a standing mixer will greatly eliminate your woes. This is doable by hand, but it'll be a workout. Be patient. Knead for 6 minutes. Turn a timer on and keep those arms working until it buzzes -- resist the temptation to stop any earlier. After six minutes, the dough should be smooth and easy to work with. It may be tempting, but don't cave. If you overwork the dough, it becomes harder to work with, the consistency becomes undesirable, and it won't raise properly. Lightly grease the bowl and the dough. If you don't, it'll dry out. Cover the dough with plastic wrap, set it on your counter, and let it rise for 1-2 hours. Try to use it as shortly after this period as possible -- it's freshest when recently risen. Pizza Stromboli Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0 Fahrenheit (232\u00b0 Celsius).  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place in a medium-sized bowl. If it's been on the short side of two hours, check to see that it's adequately raised. Coat the dough with the olive oil. Recover it with the plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. It'll be a bit more manageable when it cools slightly. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the tomatoes and their juices. Add the oregano and salt and bring to a boil. Stir it occasionally, thoroughly combining the spices. Reduce the heat in the saucepan and simmer. Crush the tomatoes with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.

Keep an eye on it, especially if your oven runs hot or cooks unevenly. Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle with basil. Slice the bread into rounds and divide among individual plates. This recipe should make about 6 servings -- depending on how hungry everyone is, of course. Ground Beef & Pepper Stromboli Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Grab a cookie sheet and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. If you'd prefer, line a sheet with parchment paper (no muss, no fuss, just throw it away after). Prep your ingredients. Chop up your bell pepper(s) and, if applicable, shred the mozzarella. Measure out your ingredients and set aside for swift assembly.

Keep an eye on it and flip it halfway through, if necessary. Remove from the oven and let cool. Slice as you see fit. This recipe should serve 6. Rolling or Braiding For a roll, start with the thinnest strip of dough. You want the largest section of non-filled dough to be at the end of the roll. This gives it a nice thin-to-thick shape and helps the dough maintain form in the oven. Brush with an egg yolk, if desired. Resume cooking instructions. For a braid, pile your fillings in the center. Start making parallel horizontal cuts about 1 1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the filling and at 1 1/2 inch (3.75 cm) intervals down both sides. Leave a 1 1/2 inch (3.75 cm) uncut edge at the top and bottom for the ends. Then, fold the uncut top and bottom edges over the filling. Starting at the top, start braiding the cut ends. Fold one strip over from the right side, then the left, and repeat, slightly overlapping a bit each time. Continue in this motion to create a braided effect, tucking in the last strips underneath the bottom, uncut edge. Cover with a kitchen towel or cheesecloth and allow the stromboli to rise for 30 minutes. Resume cooking instructions.",
