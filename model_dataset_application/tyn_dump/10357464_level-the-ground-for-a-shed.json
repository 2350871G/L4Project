The basic tools you need are a hammer, screws, a drill, a shovel, a rake, a spirit level, measuring tape, a ground tamper, a pencil, and string. You will also need 2 4 in (10 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) posts that are the same length as your shed and 2 4 in (10 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) posts that are the same width as your shed. Get a long, flat plank of wood that you will use to make sure the ground is level. Get hardened steel, structural, No.9, 2.5 in (6.4 cm) long screws."

The same goes for the mason blocks. To find the amount of pea gravel you need, multiply the length of your shed by the height of the hole (3 in (7.6 cm)) by the width of your shed. You will need enough mason blocks to lay around all 4 walls of the shed, so find the perimeter of the shed, and divide it by the length of each block to determine how many you need."

Avoid areas with standing water because this will cause a lot of problems for your shed. The water will soften the soil over time and the weight of your shed will cause the soil to shift even more.

Use a measuring tape to mark out this area on the ground. Plant wooden stakes at all 4 corners of the shed base. For example, if your shed is 15 ft (4.6 m) by 7 ft (2.1 m), measure the front of the shed first. Place 2 stakes at either side of the 7 ft (2.1 m) measurement.

Keep digging the topsoil out of the hole and placing it in a pile on 1 side until you start to notice a lighter colored, more solid soil below it. Stop removing the soil when you reach this lighter soil. Level out the subsoil using a plank and spirit level. Place a long plank into the area. At first, judge where the ground is uneven by looking at the plank. Move the subsoil until the plank looks close to level. Lay your spirit level on top of the plank and keep moving the soil until the spirit level shows that the ground is even. Repeat this process across the entire surface of the hole. Leveling the Soil and Pea Gravel Fill the hole to 3 in (7.6 cm) below the top with topsoil. Now that the subsoil is level, use your shovel to add the topsoil back into the hole. While the topsoil is softer than the subsoil and can cause problems, you won't need to worry once the subsoil is level. You will fill the remaining 3 in (7.6 cm) with pea gravel later. If your topsoil contains grass, use your shovel to slice the layer of grass off the topsoil. Use a rake to break up lumps in the topsoil. The topsoil needs to be even before you add the pea gravel on top of it. Topsoil tends to have rocks and other items embedded in it that can make it hard to even out. Drag your rake across the topsoil, breaking up lumps as you go. Throw any rocks out of the area as you rake them up. Compress the soil using a ground tamper. A ground tamper is a heavy device with a flat head. Place it flat on the topsoil and push down on it to compress the soil. You can stand on it to create a downward force. Use the tamper to compress all of the soil in the hole. You can also use a vibrating whacker plate or another heavy, flat object that's easy to move. Level out the topsoil with the plank and spirit level. To level out the topsoil, use the exact same method that you used to level out the subsoil. Place the plank on the topsoil and remove or add topsoil until it looks level. Place the spirit level on the plank and adjust the soil until the spirit level says the plank is level. The bubble at the center of the spirit level will be inside the 2 lines when the spirit level is level. Lay the plank across the whole area of the hole to level it out. Fill the hole with your pea gravel and level it. Pea gravel will allow for water to pass into the soil under the shed. Use your shovel to fill the hole with pea gravel. Once the pea gravel is added and the hole is full, level it out using the ground tamper. The ground tamper will make the pea gravel level as you compress it.
