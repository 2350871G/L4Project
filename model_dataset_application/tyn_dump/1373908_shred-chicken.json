          "description":"There are several different ways to do this. The chicken must be cooked before it is shredded, as it will not shred easily if uncooked. Boiling the Chicken: Place the chicken in a large pot. Cover the chicken completely with water or chicken stock. Chicken stock will give the chicken a saltier flavor. Add salt and pepper to your taste. Cover the pot with a lid and bring the water to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium low and allow the chicken to cook for about an hour or until it is fully cooked. The chicken is done when there is no pink coloring and the meat comes off easily from the bone. If you are cooking chicken breasts, you should be able to tear parts of the chicken off easily with a fork. Simmering the Chicken in a Skillet: (This method works best for chicken breasts.) Place one tablespoon of olive oil in a 12-inch skillet and heat on medium. Add the chicken breast top down and cook it for five minutes until it is golden brown on top. Add \u00be cup of water or chicken stock to the skillet and flip the chicken over. Place a lid on top and let the chicken simmer on medium heat for seven to ten minutes, or until the chicken is cooked all the way through. If the water or stock evaporates too quickly, you can add \u00bc cup of water or stock. Using a Crock-Pot: This method works especially well if you\u2019re cooking a whole chicken and have about seven hours before you need to serve it. Place your chicken in a crock pot. Add any seasoning you would like such as salt, pepper, paprika, etc. You do not need to add any liquid. Set the Crock-Pot to low, put the lid on, and let the chicken cook for about seven hours."
