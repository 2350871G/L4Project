If you\u2019re willing to spend a little more money, you can also spring for a complete leather maintenance package. These kits often include other products that are useful for extending the lifespan of your leather goods, such as neatsfoot oil, leather milk, and protective beeswax for waterproofing. Avoid using natural alternatives like olive or coconut oil. While these can help relax leather in the short term, they have a tendency to absorb deep into the material. Over time, they can lead to permanent discoloration or more serious cracking and deterioration."

That way, you can ensure that you\u2019re getting just the right amount. When it comes to leather products, less is more. You just want to treat the surface of the leather, not give it a bath. Don\u2019t apply the product directly to the leather. Not only is this a recipe for a giant mess, it also makes it harder to distribute the conditioner consistently."

The leather should have a faint sheen to it, but not appear wet or oversaturated. Leather conditioners are safe enough to use on every part of the item\u2019s exterior, but you could also focus your attention where it\u2019s needed most, such as the elbows of a jacket or the toe or ankle area of a boot. There\u2019s no need to rub on multiple coats. Any additional conditioner you apply will just accumulate on the surface."

With each application, the stubborn material will grow more and more supple. If you live somewhere with a warm, dry climate where your leather is routinely exposed to the elements, consider upping the frequency to once every couple of weeks. Since it will remain in a climate-controlled environment, leather furniture and upholstery will only need to be conditioned about once every six months."

Run a cool stream straight from the tap, or, better yet, pour in a bottle of purified drinking water. Make sure you screw the top on tight to avoid any unfortunate mishaps. If possible, use distilled water. There will be less chance of the unsightly spotting and mineral buildup that often comes with hard water. Assuming you can\u2019t get your hands on a spray bottle, you can also wipe down the leather with a damp cloth. This method won't be very useful on waterproofed leather, which will just cause the water to roll right off."

          "headline":"Spray the entire surface of the leather.",
          "description":"Mist the item from top to bottom until the water just begins to bead up. As it sits, the moisture will seep into the leather, breaking down the stiff grain ever-so-slightly. During this time, you can slip into the item (if it\u2019s something wearable) and move around a bit to stretch it out and help it conform to your body\nAlternatively, consider stepping outside for a few moments during a light drizzle. Just be careful not to stay out so long that the leather becomes sopping wet. Too much water is not good for leather, but a little bit can have a gentle weathering effect without causing any serious damage."

The remaining moisture will escape via evaporation. It\u2019s important not to leave behind any standing water. Oversaturation can eventually produce cracking and fading and cause leather to take on a dull, coarse appearance. Don\u2019t forget to dry off all metal components to keep them from rusting."
