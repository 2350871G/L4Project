  "text":" Cleaning the Brick Move all furniture and knickknacks out of the way. Before you start work on your fireplace, you need to be able to get to it! Move furniture out away from the fireplace and take anything you have on the mantle down. You may also want to take the mantle down if it's just a wooden board screwed into the brick. Spread out a drop cloth on the floor. Put a drop cloth down below the fireplace, making sure it covers all the floor near the fireplace. Tape it into place with painter's tape so that it doesn't move around while you're trying to paint. Remove the ashes from the fireplace.
