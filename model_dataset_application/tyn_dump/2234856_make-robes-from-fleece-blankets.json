  "text":" Preparing your Fleece Blanket Find a fleece blanket that is at least 70 inches (1.8 m) wide, if you are making a robe for an adult. You can use smaller blankets for children. If you do not have an extra fleece blanket at home, buy a blanket from a craft store and wash it at home. If your fleece blanket has a decorative edge, you may want to cut around the edges of the blanket in a straight line to make the robe appearance more uniform. Ready a large craft table so that you can measure, cut and craft your robe. Working on a flat surface will also help to make your cuts more even. Smooth it out and fold it  in half horizontally (across the width). Make sure the wrong side (inside of the robe) is out. Lay it on the table with the ends, rather than the folded side, facing you. Cutting your Fleece Blanket Go to the right hand side of the fold. Measure down 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the top of the fold. Mark the point with a fabric pen. Measure horizontally from the right edge of the blanket, at the 6 inch (15.2 cm) mark, into the center of the blanket. Measure and mark a 20 inch (50.8 cm) line into the interior if you are short and a 25 inch (63.5 cm) line if you are taller. Cut a line from the 6 inch (15.2 cm) mark inward toward the 20 to 25 inch (50.8 to 63.5 cm) mark. This will serve as 1 of the robe's arms. Repeat the same measurements and marks starting from the left hand side of the blanket fold. Cut an arm of equal length. Use a straight edge to measure a point 2 inches (5 cm) outside of where your arm slits stop down to the bottom of the fleece blanket. Mark it with a fabric pen. Repeat on the opposite side. Cut the straight line up the sides through both pieces of the blanket. Discard the extra fabric. Find the center of the blanket's width. Cut up through the center in the top layer until you reach the fold. Do not cut through the bottom layer. Place a large bowl across the top center of the fold, so that it forms a slight downward curve over the cut corners you just made.  Draw around the bottom of the bowl with your fabric pen. Remove the bowl and cut out the downward arc to make your curved neckline. Sewing your Robe Gather the ends of the fabric and pin them together. Since fleece doesn't fray, you can gather it right at the edge for a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Sew the arms together on each side, over the edges of the arm material. Remember that this will be on the inside of your robe. Pin the sides of the robe together in the same fashion. Sew down each side on your sewing machine. Fold the fleece approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) on each side of the center slit. Pin it into place. Sew a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) hem into the edge of each center slit. If you want to have a robe/blanket, sometimes referred to as a \"snuggie,\" you can leave the back open so that you can wear the robe backwards when you are sitting in a chair or lying on a couch. Sew together a robe waist band from your scrap pieces of fleece. Cut a piece that is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide. If 1 piece of side fabric is not long enough, sew 2 pieces together. Test the fleece band around your waist to see if you can wrap it around you and tie it comfortably. Turn your robe inside out and try it on. Mark a place on the back of each side of your waist with a pin. When you take the robe off you can measure to make sure the pins are at the same height on your robe. Cut 2 piece of scrap fleece that are 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Hand sew these loops onto the places where you have attached the pins. This will help to hold your waist band in place when it is not tied. Put the finishing touches on your robe as desired. You may want to fold in the edges of the arm holes, neck hole and bottom and sew a hem. You can also do a blanket stitch around all the open sides of the robe in a contrasting thread. Finished. ",
