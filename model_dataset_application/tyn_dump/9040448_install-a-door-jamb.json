Screw the hinges onto the correct side of the jamb. Unless you are installing a prehung door, you'll need to trace the outline of the hinges on the jamb and cut an indentation using a router or utility knife. Place the door in the jamb and fasten it to the hinges. Make sure it's tight and opening in the right direction. It's ideal to do this first so you can gauge how much space you have for the door stops and align them properly behind the hinges. Measure out the stopper width. The door stopper (also called stop molding) can be bought pre-cut or fashioned out of wood strips.

Measure it against the jamb until you're sure it's the right thickness. The stop molding is thin. When cutting it yourself, you only need strips of wood about one or two inches (two to five cm) wide. Measure the stopper's length on the door jamb. Start with the top part. Measure all the way across the jamb so that the stopper will go all the way across the jamb. Now measure the amount of wood needed from top to bottom of both the left and right sides of the jamb. Cut your stopper wood down to size. Use a saw to trim the wood to the required length.
