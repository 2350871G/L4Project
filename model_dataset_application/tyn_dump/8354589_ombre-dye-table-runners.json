In general, you will mix the dye with water, adding either salt or vinegar based on the type of fabric you will be using. You should make up to four cups of dye. Mix the dye in a separate bowl, pitcher, or large measuring cup. You should adjust the amount of dye for the vibrancy that you want in your table runner. Darker or brighter colors will need more dye. Lighter or pastel colors will need less dye. For cotton, rayon and linen fabrics, mix in one cup salt of salt. For silk and nylon fabrics, stir in one cup of white vinegar."

You only need two dye baths if you are using two colors. Make one bath for each color used, according to the instructions on the dye packet. Some color combinations that might work include:\nOrange and pink\nGreen and blue\nPurple and pink\nRed and yellow Roll but do not fold the runner. Dampen the runner, and squeeze out extra water.
