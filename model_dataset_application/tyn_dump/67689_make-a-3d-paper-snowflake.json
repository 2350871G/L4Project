  "text":" Gather the materials. You'll need six (or eight for a fuller snowflake) pieces of paper. White copy paper will do, although you can use more elaborate types of paper like construction paper or origami paper. You'll also need scissors, clear tape, and a stapler or some double-sided tape. Fold each of the six pieces of paper in half diagonally, and then in half again diagonally. If the paper you are using does not make a perfect triangle, cut off the rectangular edge that sticks out to make the sides align perfectly. You should end up with a square folded into a triangle. Fold the triangle in half, noting where the folded \"bottom\" of the triangle is. Cut three slits in the triangle. Position the scissors along the bottom fold, and parallel to one of the edges going up to the top. Cut almost all the way up to the double folded crease, but not quite. Keep about the same distance between each cut. (This might not be suitable for thicker paper, since the number of layers makes it difficult to cut through.) Unfold the paper so that it is flat. Position it so that one of the points of the square faces you. It should look like the picture. Keeping your paper diamond side-up, roll the first two innermost paper lines together to form a tube. Tape these two pieces together. You should see triangle shapes on each side of the roll. Turn the diamond over to the other side of the paper. Take the next two paper lines and pull them together on the opposite side of the tube and tape together as before. This will be a more rounded shape and wider than the first tube. Keep turning the paper and joining the paper lines together on opposite side in the same fashion until all paper lines have been joined.  Repeat Steps 2 to 7 with the remaining 5 pieces of paper.  Join 3 of the completed rolled pieces together at one end and staple together using the other hand. Do the other 3 pieces the same way. Now you will have 2 pieces consisting of 3 strands or \"arms\" each. (For smaller snowflakes, it may be easier to use double-sided tape or white glue in place of staples.) Staple the two new pieces together in the middle.  Staple where each of the six arms meet. This ensures that the snowflake shape is pulled into place. See picture at top for the finished snowflake. Hang them up, use them to make a center piece or use them to decorate in your own way in places where they can be admired. ",
