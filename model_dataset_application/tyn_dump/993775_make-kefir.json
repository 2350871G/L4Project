You can also divide clumps of kefir seeds and give some to friends. Like sourdough, the kefir will simply reproduce, so you'll never run out. Kefir seeds can be either frozen or dried if you want to store them. If you expose the kefir seeds to a chemical or extreme temperatures, they can die."

          "description":"If you get into the daily habit of making kefir, it's worth picking out a jar that's just the right size for your needs. For an average amount of kefir, use a quart-sized mason jar. Kefir needs a breathable lid, which you can create using a coffee filter and a mason jar lid ring. Don't use a plastic container, since the molecules can leach into the kefir. If you wish,  sterilize the jar before using it by boiling it for five minutes, then draining it on a clear paper towel."

          "headline":"Pick out a kefir base.",
          "description":"Kefir is usually made with whole milk. Using full-fat milk gives the kefir a tangy flavor and a yogurt-like texture, making it great to drink by itself or use in smoothies and recipes. For an even thicker kefir, add some cream. If you'd prefer not to drink cow milk, try these alternatives:\nWater. You can make a fermented water-based drink with kefir to get its nutritional benefits. Make sure you use purified water, though - tap water contains chemicals that can kill kefir. Goat's milk. The human body is able to digest goat's milk more easily than cow's milk, so this is a good alternative if you're lactose intolerant. Coconut milk. Kefir-fermented coconut milk makes a great base for fruity, healthy drinks. Use the purest coconut milk you can find, with no additives or sugars. If possible,  make your own coconut milk to use. Grains won't reproduce in coconut milk, so you will have to return them to a dairy base when you're finished making this type of kefir."
