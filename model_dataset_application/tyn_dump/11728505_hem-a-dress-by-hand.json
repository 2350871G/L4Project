Lay a ruler or measuring tape on the dress and make marks every 4 inches (10 cm) along the hemline. Then, lay a ruler across the marks to line them up and draw along the hemline. If you're struggling to mark an even hemline, put the dress back on while it's inside out and ask a friend to mark the line for you."

Once you've cut the fabric along this line, you'll fold it up so your hemline falls where you want. If you forget to mark a lower cutting line, your finished hemline will be higher since you'll fold and sew the bottom edge of the fabric."

Consider purchasing scissors that you only use for sewing projects and never use them to cut paper or cardboard, which could blunt them.

Skip this step if you're hemming the unfinished edge from a dress that you've already measured and cut. Hand-Stitching the Hem Fold the edge of the fabric over 2 inches (5.1 cm) and tuck the raw edge under. Take the raw edge of the fabric and bring it up so the bottom of the fabric lines up with the hemline that you marked. Then, fold the top \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) of the folded fabric under to hide the raw edge.Variation: For a completely no-sew option, cut a strip of fusible hem that's as long as the hemline.

To prevent the folded edge from coming undone, stick a sewing pin through the folded fabric. Ensure that you insert the pins vertically so they secure the folds. Position the sewing pins about every 4 inches (10 cm) so the fabric doesn't slide around. Thread a sewing needle. Cut a length of thread that's about 20 inches (51 cm) long and thread it through the eye of a sewing needle. Then, make a knot at the tail. It's important to choose thread that perfectly matches the dress. This way, it won't be noticeable if someone sees the dress's inner hemline. Insert the needle into the fabric at the seam. Keep the dress turned inside out so you're only sewing through the wrong side of the fabric. Find the vertical seam where the dress pieces are sewn together. Then, push your needle through a few of the fabric's surface loops so you're not inserting it from the bottom of the fabric. Pull the thread until you reach the knot at the end of the tail.

It might feel like you're not really sewing through the fabric, but as long as you pick up a single stitch, your hemline will hold. Pick up a stitch on the folded fabric below the hemline. Insert the tip of the needle into a single stitch below the fold. Ensure that you're sewing on the folded fabric instead of above it. Then, pull the thread so it secures the fold in place. Pull gently so you don't make the hemline pucker. Work the blind hem stitch from right to left across the entire hemline.
