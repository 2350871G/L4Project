This will make for a difficult \"pull\" through the conduit. Instead, connect only one wire directly to the string, create one or more loops in this wire 6 - 8 or more inches down the wire from the connection point. Slip any additional wire(s) several inches into the loop, fold over and wrap around the first wire. Repeat this as often as required and wrap electrical tape around the string / rope just above the connection point all the way down just beyond the last wrap of the last wire hooked through the loops. The result should look like the end of a pencil and will pass much easier through the conduit."

Fiberglass does not conduct electricity and is highly recommended for use instead of metal fish tapes and snakes."
