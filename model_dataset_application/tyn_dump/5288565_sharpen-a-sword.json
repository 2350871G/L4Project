Re-oil the stone when the oil gets murky. As you sharpen, residue from the blade and stone will discolor the oil. Wipe it off when this happens, and re-apply a fresh layer. Blend the edge with 400 grit sandpaper. Tear off a small, 2 inch by 2 inch piece of sandpaper. Then run the sandpaper up the blade on both sides at a 30-degree angle.
