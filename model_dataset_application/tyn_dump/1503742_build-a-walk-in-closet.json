Do I want to hang my belts or roll them? Do I want drawers or open shelving? Write your answers to each question onto a piece of paper. To give you a better idea of the space you have to work with, calculate the rough area you need for each piece of clothing.

Imagine yourself walking into your closet and approaching the section and ask yourself what would make it the easiest to use. Optimize your space! After giving each section proper function, start asking yourself what makes it look good without compromising this function.
