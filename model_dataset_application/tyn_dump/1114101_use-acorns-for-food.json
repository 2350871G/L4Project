It is possible to remove the tannic acid by simply leaching it out of acorns in a pot of boiling water, pouring out the hot water and having repeated changes of water. Continue doing this until the water does not turn brown after you have strained and replaced it. Another method for leaching: place one tablespoon of baking soda into one litre of water. Leave the acorns to soak in the baking soda infused water for 12-15 hours. A Native American or rustic method is bagging the nuts and allowing them to soak in a clean, flowing stream for a few days until no brown-colored water is seen when checking their progress."
