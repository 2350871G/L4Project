  "text":" Shredding with a Food Processor Wash your squash. Peel the zucchini if you don\u2019t want the peel to be included in your zucchini. The peel contains a large amount of nutrients, so avoid peeling it if you don\u2019t mind the flavor. Cut off the ends of the zucchini. Then, slice the zucchini in half lengthwise. Scoop out the mature seeds in the center. If your zucchini is less than eight inches (20 cm) long, they may be left in without changing the consistency of your shredded zucchini. Set up your food processor. Place the shredding disk on it if you have one. If not, you can shred it using the regular blade with a pulsing motion, although it will result in smaller shreds. Chop the pieces into two-inch (five cm) squares and toss them into the food processor. Fill it up to the top. Pulse your food processor for 30 seconds or insert the squash through the shredding attachment. Check to see if your zucchini shreds are small enough. If they aren\u2019t, pulse for 15 more seconds. Shredding with a Spiral Slicer Order a spiral vegetable slicer. This device is similar to an apple peeler. You insert the vegetable and turn a crank to force it through the blade in a spiral motion. Spiral shredders come in a few different types. In some cases, you place the vegetable inside a small container. While others ask you to insert the vegetable into a horizontal platform. Read the directions carefully before using the slicer. Wash the zucchini thoroughly. This machine works best with long, straight vegetables. Each squash should be at least one inch in diameter. Don\u2019t cut the zucchini in half vertically. The slicer will leave a small core that includes the mature seeds. Insert the squash into the machine, right in front of the blade. Place the lid or crank on the machine. Turn the crank to cut the vegetable in a spiral motion. You will feel when the crank stops giving you resistance. A small vegetable core will remain. Remove the spiral shreds from the machine or the other side of the spiral shredder.  Shredding with a Grater Wash your squash thoroughly. Trim the ends. Peel the zucchini if you don\u2019t want the peel in your recipes. Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise only if it is over eight inches (20 cm). Scoop out the mature seeds from the center. If you are shredding a very large zucchini, cut it into fourths. Scoop seeds out of each section. Place your large box cheese grater on your cutting board. Turn it so that it is on its side with the largest grating holes facing up. Grasp the top of the zucchini. Run it lengthwise along the top of the grater to achieve long, spaghetti-like shreds. You can turn the zucchini horizontally to make smaller shreds. Be very careful as you get closer to your hand. Reposition it frequently to avoid cutting yourself. Tip the box grater frequently to let the zucchini spaghetti fall out. Freeze or use the shredded zucchini.",
