          "description":"White shirt collars tend to pick up built-up dirt, oils, and haircare products from the back of your neck, leading to grungy, yellowish discoloration. The next time you plan to put on a white shirt, jump in the shower first and give the back of your neck a good scrub with soap or body wash. If you don\u2019t have time for a shower, wash the back of your neck with a soapy washcloth or a cleansing wipe before putting on your shirt."

These products can easily pick up dirt and grime, and some may contain staining ingredients. Let any hair product dry before putting on your shirt, especially if your hair is long enough to touch your collar."

          "description":"The major culprit behind those aggravating yellow underarm stains is not your sweat, but the aluminum used in many deodorants and antiperspirants. A chemical reaction between sweat and aluminum creates the yellow discoloration. To prevent this problem, switch to a natural, aluminum-free deodorant that focuses on combating bacterial odors rather than blocking your pores. Look for deodorants that say \u201caluminum free\u201d on the label, or make your own deodorant using household ingredients and essential oils. Some antiperspirants are formulated to both reduce sweating and prevent yellow stains. Look for deodorants that say something like \u201canti-yellow staining\u201d or \u201cfights stains on shirts\u201d on the label. To fight wetness without shirt-staining aluminum, combine an aluminum-free deodorant with a sprinkling of absorbent Gold Bond or a little baby powder."
