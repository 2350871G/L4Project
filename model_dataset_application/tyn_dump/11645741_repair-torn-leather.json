          "description":"To repair a tear in leather, purchase a leather repair kit. They are all basically the same, except some kits rely on heat instead of glue. The kits that require heat are easier to use, but they tend to be much weaker. Purchase a kit with a color compound that matches your leather. Put on some nitrile gloves before patching your leather to keep your hands clean. This will work for any minor tear where none of the leather has been removed. Holes and large rips with missing chunks of leather requires the help of a professional to patch and retreat it. Repair kits come with a fabric patch, leather glue, palette knife, tweezers, and leather finish. Purchase a leather repair kit online. You may be able to find specialized kits at an auto repair or furniture shop."

Cut out a piece of the patching fabric using scissors so that it is at least 1 in (2.5 cm) bigger than the tear on all sides. You are going to glue the patch to the underside of the tear. It needs to be a little bigger than the tear itself so that there\u2019s room for the glue to stick to the fabric."

Once the fabric is under one portion of the leather, gently lift the opposite side of the tear and slide the patch over. Release the patch once it looks like the fabric is totally filling the gap in the leather.Variation: If you\u2019re having trouble getting the patch to lay flat in the center of the tear and you\u2019re repairing a car seat, sofa, or thick jacket, hold the patch over the opening on top of the leather. Then, push a safety pin into the patch in the center of the tear. This will keep the fabric from sliding around while you push the patch under each side of the tear.

Slide the knife back and forth to apply the glue to the underside of the leather surface.Tip: If the opening is really small, use a toothpick or popsicle stick to lift the leather up. If the tear is on the larger side, you may need to use a toothpick or popsicle stick to hold the leather up while you reload the palette knife with more glue. Some repair kits use heat instead of glue to adhere the patch to the leather. On these kits, use a hair dryer or iron to heat the patch and activate the adhesive that is built into the fabric. If your tear has more than 2 sides, repeat these steps for every side of the tear."
