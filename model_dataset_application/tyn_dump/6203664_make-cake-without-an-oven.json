Cover the pot with its lid to prevent the water from evaporating as you prepare the cake batter. Grease the baking pan.

Add the cocoa powder to the small batch. Sprinkle the cocoa powder into the smaller batch of batter. Mix well by hand or with an electric mixer set to low speed. Combine the batters in the prepared pan. Pour the vanilla batter into the greased pan, then drizzle the chocolate batter on top. Use a knife to carefully swirl the two batters together without mixing them. This act will create the marbled effect. Cover the pan. Tightly cover the top of the cake pan with aluminum foil. Fold the foil under the bottom of the pan to hold it down. The top of the pan must be covered tightly. Otherwise, excess moisture from inside the steamer can get into the batter and ruin the results.
