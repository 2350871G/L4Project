Dry champagne styles can be used as a palate cleansing aperitif, such as after eating salty snacks or sushi. Or, finish a meal with champagne to cleanse the palate, rather than having dessert.

They also pair well with spicy foods as the can help balance out the dish. Ros\u00e9 styles contain tannin and are good for matching with rich fish dishes, such as ocean trout or salmon.

For example, to make a very simple champagne cocktail, place 1 sugar cube in a champagne glass, add 5 drops of Angostura bitters, then fill the glass two thirds full with chilled champagne.
