When choosing the material for the pot, decide on how much you want to spend and purchase a ceramic, plastic, metal, or wood pot. When your tree outgrows the first pot, you can transport it to a larger pot.

Choose the healthiest and largest sucker from your plant and use gardening shears to cut off the rest of the suckers from the corm. When your tree starts to grow fruit it will need to be pruned again. After harvesting the fruit, cut down the tree so it's 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) from the ground, without damaging the main sucker. The tree will grow more fruit after you prune it. Suckers will look like shoots that grow out of the corm and have leaves.
