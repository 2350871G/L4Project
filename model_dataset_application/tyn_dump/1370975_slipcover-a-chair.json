          "description":"Be sure to purchase enough fabric to fit your chair's measurements (plus a little extra for hemming and mistakes). For maximum durability, choose a fairly sturdy fabric, like denim, thicker cotton/hemp blends, canvas, or twill. Fabric is sold in a wide variety of widths: 36 inches, 42 inches, 60 inches, and all the way up to widths over 100 inches. For slipcovers, it's best to buy one of the wider widths (60 inches or more) because the wider the fabric is, the less need you'll have to sew separate pieces of fabric together. Some chairs are bigger than others, but as a very general rule, about four to six yards of a 60-inch-wide fabric should be enough for a standard armchair."

          "description":"You\u2019ll need tracing paper in order to make the initial pattern for your slipcover. The most common types of paper used for pattern tracing are freezer paper, Swedish tracing paper, and medical exam table paper. Freezer paper is relatively inexpensive and thick enough not to accidentally tear, though it\u2019s also harder to see through. Swedish tracing paper is easy to see through and doesn\u2019t tend to tear accidentally, but it\u2019s also relatively expensive. Medical exam table paper is easy to see through and very inexpensive, but it\u2019s also thinner and tends to wrinkle easily."

          "description":"It\u2019s important to trace the pattern for each section of the chair onto tracing paper before attempting to assemble the slipcover. Without a clearly traced pattern, you\u2019ll end up with an imprecise and ill-fitting cover. Start by carefully drawing the back, front, seat, and arms of your chair on your tracing paper. Compare your tracings with the measurements initially you took for guidance. If you plan to put a skirt on the chair, you can also draw a pattern for the skirt onto the tracing paper. You'll need a strip of fabric as long as the distance around the base of the chair and wide enough to hang from the bottom of the chair to the floor."

If desired, use fabric adhesive (available at most craft and fabric stores) to stick your slipcover in place. Doing so will hold your slipcover over the chair snugly and prevent it from falling, bunching, or slipping off. Use the adhesive to adhere the rear of the new slipcover material to the top of the original chair fabric. You'll need to lift up the slipcover fabric and work underneath it to do this, so it can help to have a friend help you here by pointing out where to put adhesive. Luckily, fabric adhesive is usually very forgiving before it sets. If you make a mistake, just pull the fabric up and reposition it as needed. Different adhesive products will have different drying times, but, in general, most fabric glues take about two to four hours to set. Fabric adhesives can usually be washed safely after a few days.

    "Different adhesive products will have different drying times, but, in general, most fabric glues take about two to four hours to set.",
    "Fabric adhesives can usually be washed safely after a few days.",
    "Check the product's label for more specific instructions.",
    "Trim off any excess material.",
    "Once the adhesive has dried in place, you may carefully use pair of scissors or a fabric knife to trim the loose bottom portion of your slipcover.",
    "Ideally, you want this \"skirt\" to hang an inch or two above the floor.",
    "Take care to cut in a straight line as you go.",
    "If you make a noticeable mistake, just trim the slipcover back a few inches and glue a long, skinny strip of material around the bottom to make a new skirt.",
    "Buying a Slipcover Measure your chair.",
    "Using a measuring tape, measure the height, length and width of the chair as a whole.",
    "Take these measurements carefully.",
    "If you're spending your hard-earned money on a slipcover, you will want it to fit well.",
    "Go shopping for slipcovers.",
    "Slipcovers are available at most stores and websites carrying home furniture and decorating items.",
    "Most slipcovers range in price from about $20 to as much as $150, depending on the material of the slipcover and the size of the chair.",
    "Have your measurements handy as you shop because most slipcovers will be advertised as fitting certain sizes of chair.",
    "If you're shopping at a brick and mortar store and need help choosing the right size slipcover, talk to an employee.",
    "When in doubt, buy a slipcover slightly bigger than you think you'll need.",
    "You can always pull, sew, and trim a slipcover to make it smaller, but it's difficult to make a slipcover bigger.",
    "For maximum durability, pick a slipcover made from a fairly sturdy fabric, like denim, thicker cotton/hemp blends, canvas, or twill.",
    "Vacuum the chair.",
    "Before putting on the new slipcover, you'll want to remove any excess dirt and dust from your chair.",
    "It\u2019s also beneficial to periodically remove the slipcover and vacuum the chair again before replacing it to prevent the chair from getting musty underneath its cover.",
    "Pull the slipcover over the chair.",
    "After pulling the slipcover on, go around the chair and tuck the fitted edges of the cover into folds around the seat.",
    "Pull and tie any strings or ribbons on the front or back of the cover.",
    "These ties are added to keep the slipcover tight and secured in place.",
    "Use a tight knot, but not one that's too tight to undo, as your slipcover may change size and shape slightly with repeated use and washing."
