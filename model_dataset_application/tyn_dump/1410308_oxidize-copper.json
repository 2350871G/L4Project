Place them with their shells intact in a pot of water and bring to a boil for at least ten minutes. Don't worry about over-boiling them. In fact, that over-done greenish ring and sulfur smell is exactly what you need, since the sulfur will alter the appearance of your copper."

If you don't have a bag that can fit your copper object comfortably, use Tupperware, a bucket, or any other container that can be sealed shut or have a lid placed over it. Large containers will require a large amount of eggs. Ideally, your container should be transparent so you can check on the appearance of your copper without having to open the container."

Seal or tie the bag closed to trap the sulfur fumes inside, or attach the lid if you are using a container. The bag will expand due to the heat of the eggs, but this shouldn't be enough to break most plastic bags."

Safety glasses and a respirator mask are recommended. Be ready to wash your skin or eyes with running water for fifteen minutes in case of spills. To create a green patina, mix 2 cups (480 mL) white vinegar, 1.5 cups (360 mL) pure non-detergent ammonia, and 0.5 cups (120 mL) non-iodized salt. Mix in a plastic spray bottle until the salt dissolves. Use less salt to reduce the amount of green in the patina. For a brown patina, mix baking soda in a spray bottle full of hot water until additional baking soda will not dissolve.

If you want to have more control over exactly where and how the patina forms, scrub with a scotch brite pad, brass brush, or cotton swab after spraying.
