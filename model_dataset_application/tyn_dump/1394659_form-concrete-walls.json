Work from 1 end of the wall to the other, moving back and forth until the concrete is as high as you want the wall to be. If you can help it, don\u2019t wait to pour additional layers. The concrete will cool and begin to settle. If you have to wait, pour a store-bought concrete bonding adhesive onto the settled concrete so the next layer bonds to it. Pull the spacers out as you pour the concrete. As your forms fill, watch for the concrete to reach the wood spreaders. Have a ladder ready so you can reach the top of the forms. Tug the wire up to keep the spreaders out of the concrete. Gradually raise the spreaders as you fill the space between the forms. Take the spacers out as you work to prevent the concrete from curing around them. Leaving them in will leave gaps in the layers, weakening the wall. Smooth out the concrete with a screed or another tool. Climb up a ladder and level out the concrete with the top of the form you built. If you can\u2019t get a screed up there, try using a float or a trowel. Screeds and floats are better for covering large areas in a short amount of time. Drag the tool along the concrete to remove the excess. Pack down as much of the concrete as you can before scraping off the excess. Any air bubbles or empty space left behind reduces the integrity of your wall. To help pack and level the concrete properly, tap the forms with a hammer or mallet. Cover and cure the concrete for up to 4 days. Cover the concrete with something that holds water. Burlap and straw are a few options, but you can also buy polyethylene sheeting or concrete curing blankets. Dampen the covering with water and moisten it every day until the concrete hardens. Some concrete mixes take 28 days in total to solidify, but you will need to remove the forms before then to finish the installation. Remove the forms and the wires attached to the concrete. Cut the wires to pull them out of the concrete. Since the concrete hasn\u2019t solidified yet, you won\u2019t have trouble removing the ties. Then, pull the forms away from the concrete to remove them. Remove nails as needed to deconstruct the forms. Old forms can be reused if you plan on making more walls! You can also recycle the wood for other projects. If you leave the wires in place, they may rust and discolor the wall. Cover the wall and let it finish curing for up to 24 more days. Look for any holes in the wall before you continue. Normally, you won\u2019t need to do any additional work. Put the cover back in place, wet it again, and play the waiting game. After the concrete hardens, remove the cover to admire your work. Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for drying your concrete mix. Some mixes require less than the usual 28 days to fully cure. If you happen to see holes or other signs of damage, fix them as soon as possible. Try using a store-bought concrete patching mix. Usually, you mix the patching material like concrete, then spread it over the damaged portion with a trowel.",

    "It varies depending on which mix you choose.",
    "For a quick-dry mix, it will take about 7 days.",
    "As you wait for the concrete to cure, begin building the wood form you need to shape the concrete wall.",
    "Building Forms Stack wood planks to create a frame for the wall.",
    "These wood barriers hold the concrete in place as it dries, so you will need to create 2 of them.",
    "The cheapest and easiest material to use is 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards cut from a softwood like pine.",
    "Keep the boards less than 8 ft (2.4 m) long so they aren\u2019t too difficult to handle.",
    "Lay the boards on edge horizontally, stacking them to match the height of your planned wall.",
    "Rest the frame pieces against a solid surface to prevent them from falling.",
    "If your frame is tall, you may need to begin installing the connecting studs before adding more boards.",
    "Try to make the frame pieces as long as you need them to be.",
    "If you\u2019re building a long wall, build the frame in sections.",
    "Smaller pieces are much easier to handle and can be joined together later.",
    "If you\u2019re building your own forms, you will probably need to do plenty of cutting.",
    "Have a circular saw ready along with a dust mask and ear protection.",
    "Nail studs into the back of each frame to bind the boards together.",
    "Use more 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards to assemble the frame.",
    "Space the studs out every 16 in (41 cm) along your frames.",
    "Instead of laying the studs flat, turn them on their sides.",
    "Then, use about 4 3 \u20442 in (8.9 cm) nails per stud to secure them all to the frames.",
    "Place the nails about 2 in (5.1 cm) from the top and bottom edges of each stud.",
    "Lay wales across the studs to strengthen the forms.",
    "Use a few more 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards, placing them about every 12 in (30 cm) from top to bottom.",
    "Tip each board onto its edge, laying it horizontally across the studs.",
    "Secure the boards to each stud with 2 to 4 more 3 \u20442 in (8.9 cm) nails.",
    "The wales also provide a place for you to tie connecting wires and attach braces for additional support.",
    "Attach a brace board over the back of the wales.",
    "Select 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards as tall as the forms you\u2019re constructing.",
    "Position the braces about every 12 in (30 cm) along the length of the wall.",
    "Stand the braces up so only the side edge connects with the rest of the form.",
    "Then, use a pair of 3 \u20442 in (8.9 cm) nails on each wale to connect the braces to them.",
    "The braces aren\u2019t exactly part of the forms, but they provide much-needed stability to the forms.",
    "Create the rest of the braces with additional boards and stakes.",
    "Start with a wood board sharpened into a stake you can plant in the soil outside.",
    "Set another wood board on its side, running it from the brace board to the stake.",
    "Then, add a third board, running it diagonally from the center of the brace to the stake.",
    "Use more nails to attach the boards to the brace and stake.",
    "The additional brace boards need to be about 12 in (30 cm) long.",
    "The exact length depends on the size of your wall.",
    "Taller walls need longer braces for extra support.",
    "Nail \u20444 in (1.9 cm) plywood sheets to the frames.",
    "Flip the frames over to the sides without the studs.",
    "Fit the plywood so it\u2019s the same length and height as the frame you\u2019re putting it on.",
    "Then, use more 3 \u20442 in (8.9 cm) nails to connect the plywood to the studs.",
    "Place a nail about every 12 in (30 cm) along the length of each stud.",
    "Nail through the plywood and into the studs.",
    "If you work the other way, the screw ends will stick out into the concrete you pour, affecting your wall.",
    "Installing the Forms Set the forms on plywood boards near where you plan on building the wall.",
    "Place \u20444 in (1.9 cm) pieces of plywood on the ground.",
    "These shoe plates need to be wide enough to support the forms you built.",
    "Arrange them so they border the hole in your yard where you plan on pouring concrete for the wall.",
    "Before you continue, make sure the shoe plates and forms leave the correct amount of space you need for your wall.",
    "Plant the stakes firmly in the ground.",
    "When your forms are in place, they won\u2019t budge at all.",
    "Test them out by pushing against them with your hand.",
    "If you\u2019re having a hard time getting everything to stay still where you need it, try using wire ties.",
    "Wrap wires around the studs in the forms to tie them to the shoe plates.",
    "Drill holes in the plates as needed to attach the wires.",
    "Drill \u20448 in (0.32 cm) holes on either side of each stud.",
    "Make the holes evert 12 in (30 cm) along the length of each stud.",
    "Leave about 2 in (5.1 cm) of space between the holes and the studs to avoid damaging your forms.",
    "Run wires through the holes and tie them to the wales.",
    "Use 8 gauge wire ties which have a diameter of about \u20441000 in (0.41 cm).",
    "Basically, you need to cross the wire over itself.",
    "Loop it around the wale on 1 side, thread it back through the hole, then loop it around the wale on the other side.",
    "The part of the wire between the forms will form an X.",
    "The wires hold the forms together when you pour the concrete.",
    "If the forms slip out of place, you\u2019ll be looking at a concrete mess instead of a solid wall.",
    "Tighten the wire tie with a stick or another tool.",
    "Lower the stick towards the center part of the wire.",
    "Wrap the wire around itself by turning it with a circular motion.",
    "Make sure the wire gets as tight as you can make it.",
    "If it feels slack, your forms may slip out of place.",
    "Another way to do this is by sliding tie rods through the holes.",
    "Slide brackets onto the ends of the rods so they can\u2019t slide out of place.",
    "Slip wood spacers beside each wire.",
    "You will need wood blocks as thick as your wall will be.",
    "These spacers stay in place through friction.",
    "You don\u2019t actually attach them to the wall.",
    "They prevent the forms from moving in as you work.",
    "Check your local hardware store for spacers.",
    "Many places sell \u201cspreader cleats\u201d or a similarly-named product.",
    "If you can\u2019t find any, you can always cut them yourself out of scrap boards.",
    "Drill through the spreaders and wire them together.",
    "Make a \u20448 in (0.32 cm) hole all the way through the center of each spreader.",
    "When you\u2019re done drilling, string a wire gauge through them all.",
    "Loop the wire around the top and bottom spreader.",
    "Leave a little extra length on the top part of the wire so you can easily pull the spreaders out later.",
    "Set the loop on top of your wall for now.",
    "Try tying them to the wall so the wires don\u2019t slip into the concrete as you pour it.",
    "Pouring and Curing the Concrete Mix enough concrete to complete the wall all at once.",
    "Purchase some concrete mix and pour it all into a mixer with a ramp or hose.",
    "Add water and stir the concrete according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
    "Good concrete has a gray, uniform consistency.",
    "If you add too much water, the concrete turns a little soupy.",
    "It will weaken your wall, so don\u2019t overmix your batch of concrete.",
