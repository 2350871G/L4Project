          "description":"If you already have a double boiler, you\u2019ll use the 2 pots it comes with. If not, pick out a large stock pot for the base. Then, find a metal saucepan or bowl that fits comfortably inside your stock pot. Find one that can rest on the lip of the stock pot so that it doesn\u2019t touch the bottom. Try a wide metal bowl or a smaller saucepan with a long handle. If you use a saucepan, rest the handle on the lip of the stock pot while the pan portion floats in the water. Only use a metal bowl for the smaller piece; don\u2019t use plastic or glass, which might melt or shatter. You won\u2019t be putting any wax inside the stock pot, so it\u2019s okay to use a pot you prepare food in. However, you will be placing the beeswax directly into the smaller saucepan or bowl, so choose an old one that you won\u2019t be using for food preparation. If you\u2019re using a tall metal pitcher or another bowl that does touch the bottom of the stock pot, place a metal cookie cutter at the bottom and set the smaller bowl on top of this. The cookie cutter will elevate the bowl off of the heat source."

You may have to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour for the wax to completely melt. Keep an eye on the water level, too. If it begins to evaporate away, pour more water into the stockpot periodically. Don\u2019t let the double boiler to become completely dry at any point during the process. You don\u2019t need to stir the pieces of wax; the melted liquid will quickly solidify upon contact with a colder utensil. Feel free to use a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your beeswax as it melts. It should melt around 144 to 150 \u00b0F (62 to 66 \u00b0C). Don\u2019t allow it to exceed 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C) as it will get discolored and lose its aroma past this point. Never leave the beeswax unattended as it melts."

    "Don\u2019t allow it to exceed 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C) as it will get discolored and lose its aroma past this point.",
    "Never leave the beeswax unattended as it melts.",
    "Pour the melted wax into a mold as soon as it completely liquifies.",
    "Prepare your molds or other project materials so that they\u2019re ready to use as soon as the wax has melted.",
    "Once every piece of solid beeswax melts away, remove it from the heat and immediately pour it into the molds.",
    "Use care when handling the hot wax.",
    "Wear oven gloves to protect your hands from the hot steam and any splashes of wax.",
    "If you\u2019re pouring the hot wax into glass, make sure it is heat resistant so it doesn\u2019t crack.",
    "Using a Crock Pot Water Bath Pour 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water into the basin of your crock pot.",
    "If you have a wide, shallow crock pot, try about 2 in (5.1 cm) of water, or add 3 in (7.6 cm) or more for a narrow, tall crock pot.",
    "Start with enough water so that it won\u2019t all evaporate while you\u2019re melting the beeswax.",
    "You can use tap water, or, to speed up the process, heat the water in a kettle first.",
    "It\u2019s also possible to melt the beeswax directly in the basin of the crock pot without creating a water bath, since the temperature can remain low.",
    "If you choose to do this, make sure that the crock pot basin is made from a nonstick material or line it with aluminum foil.",
    "Using the water bath is generally preferred, since it protects the wax from direct heat and makes pouring the liquid wax much easier.",
    "Place a small metal bowl inside the crock pot.",
    "Choose an old metal bowl that you won\u2019t be using for food preparation.",
    "Select a bowl that\u2019s tall enough so that water won\u2019t seep in, but not so tall that you can\u2019t close the lid of the crock pot.",
    "Make sure the bowl sits directly on the bottom of the crock pot\u2019s basin; it doesn\u2019t need to be elevated.",
    "If you\u2019re making candles, you may be able to use your candle containers for this.",
    "Just make sure you\u2019re using metal or heat-resistant glass.",
    "Set pieces of the solid beeswax into the small bowl.",
    "Since beeswax melts slowly in a crock pot water bath, use smaller pieces to help speed up the melting process.",
    "Break larger pieces of wax into small chunks of about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide, then set these into the small bowl.",
    "each.",
    "Cover the crock pot and allow the wax to melt completely.",
    "Turn on the crock pot and set it to the \u201clow\u201d temperature option.",
    "Put the cover on to seal the steamy water and heat inside the crock pot.",
    "While the beeswax melts, check on its progress every 10 to 15 minutes to make sure it doesn\u2019t reach too high a heat.",
    "Depending on how much wax you\u2019re melting, plan to wait at least 1 hour for it to fully liquify.",
    "If you\u2019d like, try monitoring the temperature of the beeswax using a thermometer.",
    "It will melt around 144 to 150 \u00b0F (62 to 66 \u00b0C), but you shouldn\u2019t let it get past 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C).",
    "Get your project materials ready while the wax melts down.",
    "Pour the melted beeswax into molds once it\u2019s melted down.",
    "Keep an eye on the beeswax as it gets close to being completely liquified.",
    "As soon as it reaches this point, you can take the lid off of the crockpot and pour out the wax into candle molds or whatever else you\u2019re using for your project.",
    "Make sure to use oven gloves as you handle the hot bowl to protect your hands from the steam and splashes of hot wax.",
    "If you want to keep it liquified for a little while longer, remove the lid and switch the crock pot to its \"warm\" setting.",
    "Making a Solar Oven Line a styrofoam cooler with aluminum foil.",
    "Cover the sides and bottom of a small styrofoam cooler with aluminum foil.",
    "Make sure the shiny side faces toward the inside of the cooler so it reflects as much sunlight as possible.",
    "This will become your solar oven.",
    "Opt for a styrofoam cooler rather than a plastic one.",
    "The styrofoam will help insulate the solar oven to keep the heat inside.",
    "Place the solid pieces of beeswax in a metal or glass bowl.",
    "Break large blocks of wax down into smaller pieces so that they\u2019ll melt down more quickly.",
    "Then, set them into a bowl that will fit comfortably inside your solar oven.",
    "You can either place the wax directly into an old bowl that you don\u2019t need for food preparation, or put it in a newer bowl that\u2019s lined with a protective layer of aluminum foil.",
    "Insert the bowl into your solar oven and cover it with a sheet of glass.",
    "Set the bowl down on the base of the solar oven so it\u2019s level.",
    "Make sure it\u2019s secure so that it doesn\u2019t tip over and spill any hot wax.",
    "Then set a thin sheet of glass or clear acrylic over the top of the styrofoam cooler.",
    "Make sure it\u2019s large enough to create a complete seal over the solar oven.",
    "Try repurposing a sheet of glass from an old picture frame for this project.",
    "Set the solar oven in the sun and allow the beeswax to melt.",
    "Make sure it\u2019s a warm, sunny day; cloud cover and cooler temperatures won\u2019t work very well.",
    "While high-tech solar ovens can heat up in sunny but cold climates, plan to use your homemade solar oven on a cloudless day when it\u2019s at least 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) outside.",
    "Find a spot outside that will receive direct sunlight for most of the day, and place your covered solar oven there.",
    "Check on the progress of your melting wax every 20 to 30 minutes, and reposition it, if needed, to keep it away from shade or moisture.",
    "Start this process earlier in the day to take advantage of direct midday sun.",
    "Don\u2019t wait until the late afternoon or evening.",
    "By the end of the day, you should have a bowl of melted wax.",
    "If you are using this process in a cooler season, find an indoor spot that receives direct sunlight.",
    "Avoid leaving the wax completely unattended; it may heat up quite quickly.",
    "Consider monitoring the temperature with a thermometer.",
    "The wax should melt around 144 to 150 \u00b0F (62 to 66 \u00b0C).",
    "Avoid letting it exceed 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C).",
    "Remove the melted wax from its solar oven and pour it into molds.",
    "Wearing oven gloves to protect your hands from the heat and melted wax, lift off the glass or acrylic cover from your solar oven.",
    "Set this aside and carefully take out the bowl containing your liquified beeswax.",
    "Immediately pour the wax into molds or use it however your project requires.",
    "Make sure you prepare your project materials as the wax melts so they\u2019re ready to go once all of the wax has melted."
