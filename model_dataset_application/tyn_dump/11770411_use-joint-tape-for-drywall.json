Start at 1 end of the seam and press the joint compound into the crack between the drywall sheets. Drag your drywall knife along the entire length of the seam to smooth it out and remove excess compound until there is just a thin layer barely higher than the surface of the drywall.Tip: You can apply this same method to repairing cracks in old or damaged drywall. The concept is the same. Just apply the tape and joint compound to a crack in a drywall sheet instead of a seam between 2 sheets to make quick repairs. Make sure you don\u2019t remove all of the joint compound from the surface as you smooth it out. Joint tape needs a base layer of joint compound to adhere to the drywall. Just try to get rid of lumps and bumps in the joint compound. This method works for any seam where 2 pieces of drywall meet flat on a wall or ceiling, including butt joints and tapered joints. For the unfamiliar, butt joints are where the sides of 2 pieces of drywall butt straight up against one another. Tapered joints are where the sides of 2 pieces of drywall are thinner than the rest of the sheets, and thus create a tapered seam."

Note that paper joint tape doesn\u2019t actually have adhesive on it, so it doesn\u2019t matter which way you fold it. The joint compound acts as the adhesive. Push the tape into an inside corner using the blade of your drywall knife. Fit the creased tape into the corner so the fold is over the seam and gently press it into the joint compound. Use the blade of your drywall knife to carefully push the crease all the way into the inside corner seam. If any excess joint compound oozes out of the sides of the tape as you press it into the corner, scrape it away with your drywall knife and discard it. Smooth out both sides of the joint tape using your drywall knife. Start at 1 side of the crease and run your drywall knife down the entire length of the tape in one smooth stroke. Repeat this on the other side of the tape. Don\u2019t push too hard or you might pull the tape out of the joint compound.

Load up half of a 5 in (13 cm) drywall knife with premixed all-purpose joint compound. Spread the compound out over 1 side of the outside corner in 1 smooth, even stroke so it just barely covers the drywall. Repeat this for the other side of the outside corner. Try to get about 2 in (5.1 cm) of joint compound on either side of the corner joint. Stick a paper-faced corner bead onto the outside corner joint and let it dry. Position the corner bead over the joint and press it lightly into the joint compound. Check that it is centered over the joint, then use your drywall knife to smooth it out and press it all the way into the joint compound on each side.
