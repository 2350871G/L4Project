It\u2019s better to add them slowly over time to preserve the health of your hydrangeas. It can take 1 to 2 growing seasons for your hydrangeas to change color."

If your soil pH is still too acidic or basic, keep adding your supplements. If your soil pH has reached a neutral area between 5.5 and 6.5 and your flowers still aren\u2019t purple, you may not have the right starting color to reach your goal. Red hydrangeas are much easier to change to purple since they mix with a blue color. Blue hydrangeas are harder to change to purple since they are already on the blue area of the color wheel. Although you can change the color of your hydrangeas, you can\u2019t change the vibrancy of the color."
