Keep the oil in the airtight-sealed jar and place the jar in a cool, dark place. Make sure wherever you place the jar is away from heat sources and direct sunlight. Spice shelf life can vary quite a bit, from months to years, so check with your seller. Cinnamon oil has numerous other uses including killing bacteria (particularly in food), it's a preservative, it controls the spread of mosquitoes, it can be used as a massage oil, it can assist with digestive problems, and its often used with warm compresses."
