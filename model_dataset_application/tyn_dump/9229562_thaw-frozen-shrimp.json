If your shrimp are stuck together, separate them before placing them in the boiling water. Remove the shrimp from the boiling water. Turn off your burner. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp from the boiling water. Pat the shrimp dry before cooking them. Place the shrimp on a paper or kitchen towel and pat them dry. Boiling your shrimp for 1 minute does not cook them, it simply defrosts them, so be sure to thoroughly cook your shrimp before eating them.",
