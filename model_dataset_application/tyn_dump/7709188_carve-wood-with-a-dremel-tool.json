          "description":"Softwoods are less likely to chip or break while you\u2019re working with them, making them easier to work with than hardwoods. Look for pieces of wood made from pine, basswood, or butternut when you first start carving with a Dremel so you can get used to the process. Make sure the wood doesn\u2019t have any warps, knots, or defects since they can be more difficult to carve through. If you\u2019ve had experience carving wood before, then you can try using hardwoods, such as oak, maple, or cherry. Hardwoods are more likely to chip, so work slowly to prevent any damage to the design. Make sure the wood is clean and dry before you carve it.Tip: Get a few extra pieces of the wood you plan on carving so you can practice before carving out your design."

Start by drawing the full outline of your design so you can trace around it while you\u2019re carving. Mark any large areas you want to carve out with slanted lines or X\u2019s so you know what you need to carve later on. Work lightly with your pencil when you first start your design so you can erase the marks and make adjustments if you need to. If you\u2019re working with a dark piece of wood, use a white pencil instead."

Print out the design on a sheet of paper and secure it to the light side of a piece of carbon paper with tape. Place the paper on top of your wood so the dark side of the carbon paper is face down. Go around the outline of the design with a pencil to transfer it onto the wood. You can get carbon paper from office supply stores.

Don\u2019t rush your design since it you can easily make a mistake and carve out a section you didn\u2019t intend to.

Secure the sabretooth bit in the end of your Dremel tool by rotating it clockwise. Turn on the tool and slowly press it into the wood to carve it out. The sabretooth bit will leave a rough finish, but it will shred through the wood very fast so you can carve out large areas. Test the speed while using a sabretooth bit on a scrap piece of wood first so you know what to expect when you use it on your design.

Follow along the outlines slowly so you don\u2019t accidentally remove too much wood from the design. Work in slow, fluid motions so you\u2019re less likely to make mistakes. Standard Dremel bit kits usually have 3-4 fluted bits you can try while carving. Use larger fluted bits to carve out big areas of wood and smaller bits when you need to add intricate lines and details. Choosing a Bit Shape to Use\nCylindrical bits work well for making flat edges and V-shaped channels.Ball-shaped bits work best for making rounded edges.Tapered or pointed bits allow you to make detailed lines as well as carve rounded lines."

Work slowly and carefully around the edges of your design to clean up any rough areas and smooth them out. You may be able to carve designs using only diamond bits if you\u2019re working with softwood, but it may wear out the bit faster."

Use a natural-bristle brush to paint a thin layer of the clear coat onto your design. Leave the clear coat to dry for 24 hours so it has time to set.

    "Sanding and Finishing the Design Sand around your carving with 150-grit sandpaper to smooth sharp edges.",
    "Once you\u2019ve carved out your design, fold a piece of 150-grit sandpaper and rub it over the surface of your wood.",
    "Focus on any areas that still have sharp points or rough textures that you want to get rid of.",
    "The sandpaper will leave a smooth texture on the wood when you\u2019re finished.",
    "You may not need to use sandpaper if you used a diamond bit in your Dremel tool.",
    "Add texture to the wood with a fluted ball bit if you want.",
    "Many people who carve wood create a pitted or textured background to make the design more visually interesting.",
    "Use a ball-shaped fluted bit in your tool and lightly press the bit into a recessed area to leave a circular mark.",
    "Continue pressing the bit into the background of your design in a random configuration for the background.",
    "You don\u2019t need to texture the background if you want your design to have a clean, smooth finish.",
    "Use a wood burner if you want to darken areas of the wood.",
    "A wood burner has a heated iron on the end to leave burn and singe marks on wood to make it look more interesting.",
    "If you have specific areas that you want to darken, plug in the wood burner and allow it to heat up completely.",
    "Press the hot end of the burner into the wood and slowly pull it in the direction you want to make your marks.",
    "You can buy a wood burner from your local hardware store.",
    "Don\u2019t touch the end of a wood burner while it\u2019s running since it can cause severe burns.",
    "Once you leave a burn mark on the wood, you will not be able to remove it.",
    "Apply a coat of stain to the wood if you want to recolor the wood.",
    "Choose a stain color that you want to use for the entire piece of wood.",
    "Use a natural-bristle paintbrush or rag to spread the stain on the surface of the wood in a thin layer.",
    "Leave the stain on the wood for about 15 minutes before wiping it off with a clean rag to check the color.",
    "Let the stain dry for 4 hours before adding any additional coats.",
    "The stain may look darker in areas you carved out and lighter on raised edges.",
    "Put clear coat or finish on the design to help preserve it.",
    "Look for a polyurethane finish or another type of clear coat to use on your wood.",
    "Mix the clear coat with a stir stick to make sure it\u2019s thoroughly combined.",
    "Use a natural-bristle brush to paint a thin layer of the clear coat onto your design.",
    "Leave the clear coat to dry for 24 hours so it has time to set.",
    "Don\u2019t shake clear coat before applying it since you could get bubbles in it that will leave an uneven finish."
