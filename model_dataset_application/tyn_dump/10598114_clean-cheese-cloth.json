Use \u00bd cup (90 g) baking soda per 1 gallon (3.75 L) of water. Leave the cheesecloth in the solution for 10-30 minutes, depending on how severe the stains are.

Simply add \u20444 cup (59 ml) of white vinegar or lemon juice per 1 gallon (3.75 L) of hot water along with the baking soda before you soak the cheesecloth. You can also spot-treat a stain by dipping a toothbrush into the vinegar or lemon juice and rubbing it against the stain before you soak it. Be sure to rinse the cheesecloth very thoroughly after to wash out all the vinegar and lemon juice. They can attract fruit flies if not completely rinsed out of the cheesecloth."

Use a detergent meant for delicate fabrics. It should be free of dyes or perfumes, which could damage the cheesecloth or leach out into your food. Use warm or hot water in the wash and cold water rinse with bleach. Avoid using a fabric softener when cleaning your cheesecloth. The extra fragrance and softening agents will leave a coating on your cheesecloth and can leach into your food the next time you use it. Cheesecloth that's labeled single-use cannot be washed in the washing machine. You may be able to hand wash it and reuse once or twice, but it's better to buy cheesecloth meant for reuse."

Check the label on your detergent to make sure it doesn't contain dyes or fragrances that could contaminate your food the next time you use the muslin. Avoid using fabric softener for your muslin, as it could cause buildup on the cloth that can leach into your food. The muslin will shrink after you wash it the first time. Pick a lightweight unbleached muslin as an easy to clean cheesecloth alternative. Unbleached muslin will have a natural cream color. Find muslin at your local fabric store.
