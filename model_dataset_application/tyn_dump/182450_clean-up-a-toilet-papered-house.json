If you simply throw paper on the ground, you will need to clean it up again. Bins will help you to avoid this. If you don\u2019t have bins, bring out a few garbage bags and put the paper in them. Garbage bags are easy to move around and can hold a lot of paper. Consider placing a rock on top of the bag so that it doesn\u2019t blow away."

Try to place the pole in between the paper and the tree branch, for example, and then pull on it. This should help take it down. To rake paper, simply reach up with your rake and scrape it down.

Make sure to use a ladder that is appropriate for the job. If you only need to reach a few feet higher, you don\u2019t need a large extension ladder. Try a step ladder instead."
