          "description":"For a truly modern living room, go with a white, cream, or beige wall color. You can also choose tones like grey or slate. Choose your modern base color, then cover all of the walls of your living room. For a modern look, bright is usually the easiest to work with. Instead of choosing an antique white or a muddy gray, look for a bright white or a silver gray. To paint the walls, lay down a drop cloth to protect your floors, and use painter\u2019s tape to protect any surface from the paint. Select regular indoor paint, and pour some into a paint tray. Then, apply the paint to your walls in light, even coats using a paint roller."

          "description":"When styling a modern space, it is best to go with neutral tones and choose 1-2 accent colors to use throughout the room. Pick 1 light shade and 1 darker hue of the same color, and choose small decorative items in this color such as curtains, lamps, or vases. If you want to add a personal touch to your space, choose your favorite color. For example, you can use a lavender and plum shade of purple. To keep things neutral, use a light and a dark gray for mostly white spaces. You can make your space your own. If you really want to use another accent color, go for it!"

Rather than traditional, hand-carved, or detail furniture and decoration, go for items that look sleek and streamlined. For example, rather than choosing a picture frame with curved edges and wood details, go with a plain, grey frame in a metallic finish. For furniture, try looking for a chair with clean lines and striking architecture rather than one with ornate features or patterns."

If you want a bright, lively space, choose a couch in your accenting color. Place your couch along the longest edge of the rug. Then, put your chair next to it. When selecting the furniture, go with simple, rectangular silhouettes for a modern living room space. If you have a television or entertainment center, make sure you can see the TV clearly from both the couch and the chairs. If you need to buy a TV in addition to the furniture, choose the right TV size and design for your space. Use rugs and pillows to soften up harsher designs. A bold rug and a couple of well-placed pillows can tie a sofa into a modern room."

Place your end table immediately next to your sofa or chair so you can easily access it. For example, if you chose a brown sofa, go with a dark brown table for a uniform look."

Situate your coffee table in the middle of your living room. If using a rug, place it on top in the center of the rug. You can stack a few magazines or books on your coffee table. In addition, place a vase or decorative accent on top, if you\u2019d like. If you don't want a glass coffee table, look for one in a single color such as a table in black lacquered wood."

Place it in a corner so it is out of the way, such as next to your TV. Then, arrange your items along the shelves so they look neat and tidy. A bookshelf is a great place to store DVDs, pictures, or artwork. Don't overload your bookshelf. To keep it modern, try to incorporate neutral-colored books or turn the books around so that the pages face outward. This keeps the shelves from looking too busy."

Either way, a large, rectangle or square rug is a great way to tie your room together. Rugs in simple patterns like checkers or stripes look great in a neutral color scheme. You can use a rug if you have hardwood, linoleum, tile, or carpeted floors."

You can also choose a throw blanket at drape it over your couch for a comfy, colorful touch. Throw pillows are a great way to add some color to your space, but they aren\u2019t necessary in modern living rooms. Go without the pillows if you want a streamlined look. You can always store excess pillows in a closet or storage ottoman and bring them out for comfort when you have company over."

If you need to add some brightness to your space, go with plain, discreet floor lamps, and place 1-3 of them across your living room. Put them in dark corners or next to a reading nook, for instance. Avoid choosing decorative, bulky floor lamps. These may look great, but they aren\u2019t a modern accessory. For example, choose white, skinny, 4 ft (1.2 m) lamps and place 1 next to your TV and another next to your reading chair. If you can, consider adding recessed LED lighting to your space to keep the number of lamps to a minimum and declutter your interior."

You can place candles and vases on your coffee table and end tables, and you can hang pictures and artwork on the walls. Pick items that you genuinely love, and use either neutral colors or your selected accent colors when decorating the space. For example, you can hang a black-and-white family portrait on the wall, and place vacation pictures in a sleek frame on your end table."

Choose a piece of artwork that is at least 2 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.61 m \u00d7 0.91 m) large, and hang it using secure nails or brackets. For example, choose a 4 ft \u00d7 4 ft (1.2 m \u00d7 1.2 m) canvas painting featuring multi-colored triangles or stripes. Then, hang this above your couch. You want your artwork to be a statement. If you can't find a large piece that suits your space, hang a smaller piece where it will have the most visual impact. Alternatively, choose a modern sculpture and place it on an end table or display case. This is a great idea if you aren\u2019t able to hang things from your walls."

          "headline":"Add a vase of flowers or a potted plant for a touch of green.",
          "description":"If you want to liven up your space, consider using a houseplant. Choose cut flowers if you want an attractive floral display, or go with a potted plant if you want a longterm option. Place your plant in the middle of your coffee table, or put it at the corner of an end table. Succulents are great for modern rooms and require minimal watering and attention. If choosing cut flowers, make sure you give them fresh water every day. Cut flowers can stay fresh in a vase for up to 1 week. If you have a potted plant, water it 1-3 times a week, based on the plant's particular needs."

If you want a pop of color, choose a rug in your accent color. Either way, a large, rectangle or square rug is a great way to tie your room together.
