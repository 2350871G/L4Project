Plunging down increases the pressure above the clog and forces it down the drain (while breaking it up), on the upstroke the pressure above the clog becomes lower than the pressure below the clog (which then may break apart and come up into the bottom of the sink, where you may collect it and dispose of it in the trash)."

      "description":"If working on a double kitchen sink with two slowly moving or clogged drains, either close up one side with a wet rag \u2014 or use two plungers at once (perhaps with a friend's help), pushing down and pulling up together. On a bathroom sink with an overflow hole, seal the hole with a wet rag (or just your hand) while plunging the drain. Failure to block any secondary openings results in a significant loss of pressure from the plunger, likely leaving the clog in place, and may cause water to eject from the opening. If you aren\u2019t dislodging the clog with a plunger, and the secondary openings are sealed off, try adding a little water in the sink around the plunger, as this may help to seal the connection to the sink/drain. If the plunger still doesn\u2019t work, the clog may be past the sewer air vent to the roof, and the force of your plunge is simply going up the vent."

If you have, be extremely careful and wear protective gloves, goggles & clothing.) Clear the trap of any clogs. If the water drained from the sink when the trap was removed, and the trap wasn't clogged, then the problem is further down the drain.
