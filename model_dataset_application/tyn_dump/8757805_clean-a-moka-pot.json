Use your fingers or a clean, soapless sponge to rub away any visible residue that doesn't wash away with the water. Do not use dish soap or scrub too vigorously, though. Dish soap will dull the pot's shine over time. It will also leave behind a lot of soapy residue, which will require excessive rinsing in order to avoid a soapy aftertaste to your next batch of coffee, especially if the pot is made from aluminum. Dish soap and/or excessive scrubbing will also strip the insides of the coffee's oils. These oils actually form a barrier that helps reduce the risk of corrosion from water."
