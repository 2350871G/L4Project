Use cinder blocks or other stone shed supports, or use treated wood to build a framework that keeps it off of the ground. Building the shed on supports keeps groundwater from soaking into it. Your options are limited if your shed is already sitting directly on the ground. You could use heavy machinery to lift the shed and then add a support structure under the shed. Most sheds installed by professionals are built up off of the ground."

Paint the entire exterior of the shed, including all four sides and the roof. This creates a water-repelling barrier so the water is not absorbed. If you are painting in conjunction with felting the roof, paint the roof in between cleaning the roof and applying the new felt."

  "text":" Weatherproofing the Shed's Structure Build the shed up off of the ground. If you are building a new shed, it is important to build it on supports rather than directly on the ground. Use cinder blocks or other stone shed supports, or use treated wood to build a framework that keeps it off of the ground. Building the shed on supports keeps groundwater from soaking into it. Your options are limited if your shed is already sitting directly on the ground. You could use heavy machinery to lift the shed and then add a support structure under the shed. Most sheds installed by professionals are built up off of the ground. Paint the outside with waterproof paint. Go to the hardware store and look in the paint aisle or speak to an employee. Choose an exterior paint that is specifically labelled as waterproof. Paint the entire exterior of the shed, including all four sides and the roof. This creates a water-repelling barrier so the water is not absorbed. If you are painting in conjunction with felting the roof, paint the roof in between cleaning the roof and applying the new felt. Caulk gaps in the shed's main structure. Grab a caulking gun and some all-purpose, exterior caulk. Look carefully for gaps at the corners and edges of the shed. Check the walls and the ceiling for holes or spaces between boards. Fill any gaps that you find with caulk. Securing the Openings and Insulating the Shed Check that the doors and windows are sealed. Always close the doors, and check to make sure they fit against the shed tightly so that nothing gets in. If there are windows that open, make sure they are shut tight any time you are away from the shed. Look around doors and windows for gaps that need to be filled. Apply weatherstripping around windows and doors. If your windows and doors don't already have foam seals around them, add some. Foam weatherstripping usually comes in a roll and is easy to apply around door frames and windows. It creates a seal for gaps between doors and windows and the frame of the building. Insulate the inside of the shed. Insulation creates a waterproof layer around the inside structure of the shed. Staple insulation to the support studs of the shed, not to the outside paneling. Insulate the roof, as well as the walls. Bubble wrap is a cheap and effective way to insulate a shed, but you can also use standard fiberglass insulation. Stapling insulation to the studs creates a small air pocket between the outer paneling and the insulation, which helps reduce moisture. Attaching Roof Felt Measure the area of the roof.
