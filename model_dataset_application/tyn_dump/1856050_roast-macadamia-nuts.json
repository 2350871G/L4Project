  "text":" Shelling the Macadamia Nuts Wear eye protection. Macadamia nuts are known for being difficult to remove from their shells. Wear safety glasses or goggles to shield your eyes from any bits of shell that may go flying during this process. Basic protective equipment can be purchased at nearly any drug or grocery store. Obtain a macadamia nut cracker. A device made specifically for the task of cracking macadamia nuts will assist you in shelling these difficult nuts. The device is made to crack the shell while preserving the integrity of the nut inside. These may be difficult to find in local stores, so order one online through Amazon or another online seller if you cannot find any in a store near you. Shell the nuts. Using your nut cracker, begin cracking the shells. Most crackers will have you pull or turn a crank that will put an immense amount of pressure on the nut until it finally cracks. Once it has cracked, peel away the rest of the shell to expose the nut inside. Throw away the bits of shell and store the nut in a bowl or container nearby. Prepping the Nuts for Roasting Use a baking sheet. A standard baking sheet should be suitable for roasting macadamia nuts. A baking sheet is a long flat sheet that has edges to keep anything, such as nuts, from rolling or dripping off the sheet. They generally measure about 17 x 12 inches (43 x 30 centimeters) with a one inch high rim. Arrange the nuts on the pan. Be sure to use nuts of relatively similar size. This will protect the smaller nuts from burning while the larger ones continue to roast. If you\u2019re unsure, turn the nuts over several times while roasting to prevent burning. It is not necessary to season the nuts, as the flavor of the nuts themselves are delicious without any additives. Do not have more than one layer of nuts, to prevent burning and uneven roasting. Create a buttery spray. Salt and butter will enhance the flavor of the nuts and is a simple mixture you can make at home. Mix water, salt, and melted butter together and pour into a spray bottle. The proportion of each ingredient can be up to you. For example, if you enjoy the taste of butter, you can melt more butter and use less water. Spray your mixture over the macadamia nuts.

You can also microwave butter to make it melt. You shouldn\u2019t need to microwave it for more than thirty seconds, as butter melts quickly. Oven Roasting the Nuts Preheat the oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius). Any temperature between 225 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (107 to 121 degrees Celsius) should be suitable for roasting macadamia nuts within ten to fifteen minutes. Mist the nuts with your buttery spray while you are waiting for the oven to warm up. Place the pan in the oven. When the oven is ready, put on a pair of oven mitts and slide the tray of macadamia nuts into the oven. Place in the center shelf of the oven. Roast for 10-15 minutes.
