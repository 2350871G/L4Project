Lightly wipe all surfaces of the stovetop, including the tops and sides of coil burners. In some cases, you may only have a flat stovetop without coiled burners, like a glass topped stove. Generally, these stoves are simply wiped clean with a suitable cleaning agent, like window cleaner. Lint left behind on coil burners will smoke unpleasantly when you turn these on later. For this reason, only use lint free cloths to clean your electric stove."

This is natural. Prevent your smoke detector from going off by turning on a stovetop fan or opening a window. When the smoke stops rising from your burners, they have burned off what they can.
