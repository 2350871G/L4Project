Make your square 7.7 by 7.7 centimetres (3.0 by 3.0 in) to create a scale model of the Great Pyramid! Every 1 centimetre (0.39 in) will represent 30 metres (98 ft) of the pyramid."

Mark the spot where you need to place each line with a small hash mark and then rotate your ruler to draw each line perpendicular to the square's side. For the Great Pyramid scale model, place each line 3.85 centimetres (1.52 in) in from the corner of each side, and make it extend 6.2 centimetres (2.4 in) out from the square. If you're not building the scale model of the Great Pyramid, you have to draw each line so that it's big enough to meet the other faces of the pyramid in the center. To be safe, make each line at least the same length as a single side of your square."

Sketch your lines out using the ruler and pencil until you've drawn 8 connecting lines to their corresponding corner on the square. You should now be looking at 4 triangles that share a base with the 4 sides of your square. For the scale model, each connecting line should be 7.3 centimetres (2.9 in)."

You can fold each face so that it lays flat in the center before folding the next section if you want to get each side out of the way. This may make folding much easier."

    "Draw and cut out a square base for your pyramid.",
    "You can draw your base out so that it fits perfectly around your pyramid by holding your glued triangles in place and using the base of each face as a straight edge.",
    "You can also choose to make a bigger base by measuring 4 lines of qual distance out from each side of the pyramid.",
    "Use a straight edge and a pencil to sketch your base and cut it out with scissors or a utility knife.",
    "For a medium-sized pyramid, a good base is 14 by 14 inches (36 by 36 cm).",
    "Draw vertical and horizontal lines with a permanent marker to make bricks.",
    "To make your pyramid look like it's made out of individual bricks, draw a series of parallel lines horizontally along each face of your pyramid with a black marker.",
    "The lines don't need to be perfectly straight if you want it to look natural, but you can choose to make them even with a straight edge if you'd like.",
    "Make vertical marks between each horizontal row every 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) to create the appearance of individual bricks.Tip: The bricks are only going to partially show through after you cover the pyramid in glue and sand, so don't worry if you make a mistake.",
    "Use a butter knife or popsicle stick to spread glue over each face.",
    "Drizzle white glue over your pyramid and use the flat side of a popsicle stick or butter knife to spread it around.",
    "Continue spreading the glue until you've covered most of the pyramid.",
    "Don't forget about the base!",
    "Spread a lot of glue around your base so that the sand can fully cover it.",
    "Sprinkle sand over your pyramid to make it look real.",
    "While the glue is still wet, pour sand all over your pyramid.",
    "Slowly pour your sand 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) above each section of your pyramid and let it collect at the base to give your pyramid a realistic look.",
    "Let it air dry for 1-2 hours before touching it.",
    "If you want more of the bricks that you drew to show through, you can scrape sections of your pyramid with your knife or popsicle stick to knock some of it off.",
    "Creating a Step Pyramid with Sugar Cubes Spread glue across the surface of a paper plate.",
    "Pour white glue on top of your plate.",
    "Use a paintbrush to spread it evenly over the surface where you want to build your pyramid.",
    "This will serve as the base, so make sure that each section has some glue on it.",
    "You can use a Styrofoam tray or wood surface as a base if you prefer.",
    "You'll need 140 cubes for a 7x7 pyramid.",
    "Place sugar cubes in a 7x7 square.",
    "Start with a corner of your pyramid.",
    "Place your first sugar cube in the glue and press down lightly to set it in place.",
    "Continue placing cubes next to it in both directions until you have 7 cubes on each side.",
    "Fill in the rest of the open space in your square with sugar cubes.Tip: Don't press down too hard on your initial layer or you'll risk breaking a cube.",
    "You don't need much pressure to get the cube to stick to the glue, since sugar cubes are porous.",
    "Drizzle glue in a 6x6 square on top of your first layer.",
    "Use the gaps between cubes to determine where a 6x6 layer will rest on top of the first layer.",
    "Pour glue in a square along the edges of your 6x6 outline and then fill in the middle of the square with glue.",
    "Put at least one dollop of glue on each interior square to ensure that the upper layer remains in place.",
    "Add your 6x6 layer of sugar cubes by putting them on top of the glue.",
    "With your glue still wet, begin to place cubes in a 6x6 row on top of your first layer.",
    "Line each cube up so that it rests directly on top of a cube underneath it.",
    "Do not press down on your cubes as you place them.",
    "Save time by setting your layer out on a separate plate and transferring it over by pinching an entire row between two fingers.",
    "Continue this process until you've completed a pyramid.",
    "Place additional layers on top of your pyramid by moving in 1 cube at a time for each layer.",
    "Your next layer will be 5x5, then 4x4, and so on.",
    "Add a new layer of glue each time that you add a layer.",
    "Do not leave cubes out of the middle of a layer or you'll risk breaking your pyramid.",
    "You can use glue and glitter, sand, or paint to cover your cube if you'd like."
