          "description":"Fill a small bowl with clean, cool water. Dip 16 strawberries in, one at a time, up to just below the leaves to rinse them off. Gently pat them dry with paper towels. If you get the leaves wet, they can curl as they dry and won\u2019t look as nice when you finish decorating them. You can use more or less than 16 strawberries if you want, just adjust the amount of chocolate chips accordingly to keep the ratio of berries to chocolate approximately the same."

          "description":"Put 1 1/2 cups (260 g) of the chocolate chips of your choice in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave them for 30 seconds at a time, stirring with a spoon after every interval, until they are totally melted.Tip: You can also color white chocolate so you can dip the strawberries in any hue that you want. Mix food coloring into the melted white chocolate a drop at a time, stirring as you go, until you get the color you want. Be careful not to burn the chocolate chips. Reduce the intervals to 20 seconds if they are almost all the way melted but just missing a couple of chips. Some common types of chocolate chips you can use are milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate."

Slowly pull it up out of the bowl and let the excess chocolate drip off back into the bowl. If you are making a larger batch of chocolate-covered strawberries, you can keep the melted chocolate warm in a slow cooker while you work."

This is why it\u2019s important to just work with one strawberry at a time. Have all your toppings ready to go so you can just dip each berry in them immediately as you go. Put the berry on a plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper or wax paper if you don\u2019t want to cover it with toppings. It's best to serve these the day they're made. If you want to store them, however, keep them in the fridge."

Use a different flavor or color of chocolate chips from the chocolate you covered the strawberry in for more variety.
