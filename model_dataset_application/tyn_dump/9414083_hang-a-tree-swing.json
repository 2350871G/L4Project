  "text":" Choosing a Sturdy Tree and Branch Select a hardwood tree. Sturdy, hardwood trees are the best for installing swings. These include oak trees, sugar maples, or ash trees. Avoid putting swings on pine trees or fruit trees. Evaluate the condition of the tree and branches. Both the tree and the individual branch need to be healthy and strong to hold a swing. Make sure that the tree is not diseased or infested with bugs. The branch should not be cracked or peeling. Never attach a swing to a dead branch. If you\u2019re uncertain about the condition of the tree, ask an arborist to check it out for you. Find a long branch that is parallel to the ground. The branch should make an \u201cL\u201d shape as it extends from the tree. You will need a branch that is at least 6 feet (1.8 m) long. The branch should not be more than 20 feet (6.1 m) off the ground. The swing will need to be at least 3\u20135 feet (0.91\u20131.52 m) away from the trunk so that it does not hit the tree. It also shouldn't, however, be near the end of the branch, where it is weakest. The branch should be very strong in the middle. Look for a branch that is at least 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter. The branch needs to be thick enough that it will not break under the force the swing exerts. Make sure that the branch does not get significantly narrower as it goes out from the tree. Bolting a Swing to the Tree Find eye bolts that are \u20448 inch (16 mm) in diameter. You can use larger eye bolts but not smaller. Get stainless or galvanized steel eye bolts that are longer than the branch is thick. If your branch is 8 inches (200 mm) thick, find an eye bolt that is longer than 8 inches (200 mm) Drill holes on the underside of the branch.
