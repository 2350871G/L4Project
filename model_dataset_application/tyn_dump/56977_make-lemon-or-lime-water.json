If you're serving the water in a plastic pitcher, there's no need to chill it before hand. Chilling the pitcher gives it a frosty look that's perfect for cooling down guests on a hot summer day. You can also place glasses in the freezer so that each of your guests has a drink that is as refreshing as possible."
