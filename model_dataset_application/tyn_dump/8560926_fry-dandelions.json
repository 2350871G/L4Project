Once you do, use your fingers to gently remove the sepals (the dark green leaves on the back of each blossom). If you\u2019ve never prepped dandelions before, keep in mind that:\nAny part that\u2019s colored dark green will retain a bitter flavor, so it\u2019s best to get rid of as much of this as possible. Dandelions can be pretty delicate and fall apart quite easily when removing stems and sepals. You may want to prep more than the recipe calls for until you get the knack for it."
