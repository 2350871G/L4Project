Never use pool grade or industrial grade DE in your home, since these forms can (eventually) cause permanent respiratory problems. All DE products are actually a mix of the \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" types. Food grade DE still has a small amount of \"unsafe\" DE, and is still dangerous if inhaled in large quantities. DE sold for pest control has to meet specific safety standards and list safe instructions on the label (at least in the US), so this is usually the best choice. Food grade DE may not have a detailed safety label, since it is not intended to be used in pure, dry form, but it is similar to pest-grade DE and the risk of harm is low with the precautions below."

Review these safety precautions before you begin:\nAlways wear a dust mask at minimum, since inhalation is the main danger. A respirator mask is much better, especially if you plan to use DE many times. Wear gloves, eye protection, long sleeves, and long trousers. Keep children and pets away from the carpet while the diatomaceous earth is there. Consider testing a small area first, following the instructions below.

The insects need to crawl across the dust for it to injure them, and they're more likely to avoid piles or thick layers of dust. Thick layers of DE are also more likely to get kicked up into the air and irritate lungs or eyes. Carpets are usually only treated on the edges so human activity doesn't kick the dust into the air (where it's more likely to make you cough than kill insects). If the carpet is in a side room, you might be able to dust a larger area and stay out of the room for a few days."

It remains effective as long as it stays dry, and often takes a week or more to start killing insects. Since the insects may have laid eggs by then, leaving on the diatomaceous earth for several weeks will help prevent a rebound."
