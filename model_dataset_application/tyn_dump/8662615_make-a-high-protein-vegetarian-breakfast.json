  "text":" Making Buckwheat Pancakes Combine your wet ingredients. First, melt your butter in the microwave or a small saucepan on the stovetop. Add the milk and maple syrup once melted. Whisk until everything is evenly mixed. Mix your dry ingredients and combine with the wet ones. In a large mixing bowl, stir your buckwheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together until they are evenly combined. Pour in the wet ingredients and repeat. Add more milk if desired to thin the batter if it\u2019s too thick for your taste. Fold the egg white into the batter. First, crack the egg over the rim of a small bowl.
