Or you can roll a small amount, if you'd only like to cut a word out. Roll the fondant to 1/8-inch (3 mm) thick. The fondant will cut easier if it's firm or chilled for a few minutes. If you're using a soft fondant, you may need to mix in a little gum paste."

Take a butter knife or offset spatula and use the blade to trim away the edges of fondant. The fondant should be within the guidelines of the mat. Rolling the fondant on the mat will also help it stick to the mat and prevent tearing. The guidelines on the sides are where the roller cutters of the Cricut move, so the fondant shouldn't go beyond them."
