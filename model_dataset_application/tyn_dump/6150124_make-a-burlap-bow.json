This can be done with nearly any width, but 2 to 4 inch (5 to 10 cm) wide ribbon will work well for many decorative applications. If you use a much thicker ribbon, you may need to cut a longer piece. It's better to start with too much length than too little since you can trim off any excess toward the end of the project."
