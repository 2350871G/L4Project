  "text":" Preparing the Batter and Pans Choose and prepare your desired cake batter. You can use your own recipe, or you can use a boxed mix instead. Most cake recipes should work for this technique. Coat 1 to 2 baking pans with butter. Make sure that you coat both the bottom and sides of the pan. If your recipe requires a different amount of pans, then just stick with that. If your recipe uses a springform pan, then use 2 regular cake pans instead. The reason you don't want to use a springform pan is because it may not fit into the pot due to the hinge and extra height. Dust each pan with flour. Add about 1 tablespoon of flour into each pan that you are using. Gently shake and jiggle the pan using a side to side motion so that the flour spreads across the bottom. Next, turn the pan on its side, and roll it like a wheel to coat the sides. Discard the excess flour. If you run out of flour, add another 1/2 to 1 tablespoon. Line the pans with parchment paper. Set the pan on top of a sheet of parchment paper, then trace around it with a pen. Cut the circle out of the parchment paper, then set it into the pan. Repeat this step for each pan that you are using. You don't need to cover the sides of the pan with parchment paper. Pour the batter into the pan(s). Use a rubber spatula to scrape every last bit of batter into the pan. If you are using multiple pans, then be sure to divide the batter evenly. Gently shake the pan(s) side to side to spread the batter around so that it is even. Lightly tap the pan(s) against the counter a few times. You don't have to do this, but it will help settle any air bubbles. Preparing the Cooking Pot Get a pot and a steamer basket or glass cooking dish. The steamer basket needs to have a flat bottom and either a set of legs that holds it away from the bottom of the pot, or a rim so that it can sit on top of the pot. You can also use a round, glass baking dish. It needs to have a flat bottom and handles so that it can rest on the rim of the pot. Fill the pot with some water, then set the basket on top.
