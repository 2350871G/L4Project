Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the potatoes in the baking dish. Bake the potato-fennel gratin for 1 hour and 30 minutes.

    "Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the potatoes in the baking dish.",
    "Bake the potato-fennel gratin for 1 hour and 30 minutes.",
    "The potatoes should become completely soft and the cheese on the top will melt and bubble.",
    "Insert a fork to see if the potatoes have cooked enough.",
    "If the potatoes are too firm, cook the gratin for another 15 minutes and check again.",
    "Rest the gratin for 10 minutes and serve it.",
    "Turn off the oven and remove the baking dish from the oven.",
    "Let the potato-fennel gratin sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.",
    "This will help the cheese set and the sauce firm up before you dish it onto serving plates.",
    "Serve the gratin with roasts, glazed vegetables, or crusty rolls.",
    "Refrigerate the leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days."
