          "description":"If you\u2019re painting screen frames that are on the ground floor, it\u2019s not necessary to use a ladder. But if the frames are too high to reach safely, place a ladder up against the wall of your home and have someone stand at the bottom to keep it steady. You may need a small stepladder to reach the top of some screen frames on the ground floor. Use a ladder with an attachable tray to prop your supplies on so you\u2019re not carrying everything at once. If you\u2019re painting screen frames indoors, set down a drop cloth beneath them so you don\u2019t get paint or primer on the floor."

          "description":"Most people paint the screen frames without removing them, but if you'd like to work on them on a flat surface, this is okay too. Press up on the upper section of the screen frame and lift the bottom portion out to the front or back to remove it. Most screen frames can easily pop out, but if they don't, it might be best to leave them installed. Place a sheet or clean piece of plastic over your flat work surface and place the screen frames on top of them."

          "description":"Fill a bucket with warm water and a regular dish soap to create suds. Dip a clean sponge or rag into the water and wipe down the screen frames to get rid of any dirt. Rinse the sponge or rag in the water every few swipes to clean it so you're not spreading around dirty water. It\u2019s okay to just use a damp rag and skip the soap, if desired. Give the screen frames a second wipe-down to remove any extra soap, if needed. Use a garden hose to rinse off the suds more quickly."

          "headline":"Use an 80-grit sanding sponge to remove imperfections from the frame.",
          "description":"Purchase a medium sanding sponge from your local home improvement store. Rub the sanding sponge against the screen frame using back and forth strokes, going along the entire frame. This will get rid of any bumps, old paint, or rust. Wipe off any dust from sanding using a clean cloth. It's not necessary to remove all of the paint if your frame is made of metal, but sanding off as much old paint as possible on a wooden frame is a good idea. Avoid pressing down with lots of pressure when you\u2019re using the sanding sponge\u2014using a light pressure works perfectly."

This will also help get rid of any dust from the sanding. Wipe the frame thoroughly to ensure it\u2019s entirely dry, otherwise the primer won\u2019t stick properly. If the towel or cloth you're using to dry the frame gets too damp, use another dry one to make sure all of the moisture gets wiped up."

Use painter's tape to attach the masking paper along the inner edge of the frame to protect the screen. Keep placing pieces of masking paper along the inner edge of the screen and securing them evenly with tape to keep off any paint and primer. Create clean lines between the frame and the screen so your paint job is straight. Purchase painter\u2019s tape and brown masking paper from your local hardware store or online. Choose masking paper that\u2019s at least 9 inches (23 cm) long so it covers as much of the screen as possible."

    "If you\u2019re painting screen frames inside, use an interior paint.",
    "Outdoor screen frames should be coated in an exterior paint.",
    "Hold the can of paint at least 5 in (13 cm) from the screen to spray it.",
    "Apply the paint color to the screen frame just like you did the primer, holding the can away from the surface as you press down on the nozzle so it covers the frame evenly.",
    "Move the can along the frame slowly as you spray and cover it in a smooth layer of paint.",
    "Shake the can of spray paint thoroughly before applying it.",
    "Go along each edge of the screen frame in as straight of a line as possible for the best look.",
    "Don\u2019t worry if the frame isn\u2019t completely covered after one layer\u2014you can apply another layer after the first one dries.",
    "Cover the frames using a paint brush if you're using liquid paint.",
    "Shake the can of paint before removing the lid or use a wooden stick to stir it, mixing the paint evenly.",
    "Dip your paint brush into the paint and apply the paint color to the frames using back and forth strokes that are all going the same direction.",
    "Go along each edge of the frame, dabbing the surface with the brush to get into any nooks and crannies.",
    "If you're painting a wooden screen frame, paint going with the grain of the wood for the best look.",
    "Wipe off any excess paint from your brush using the side of the paint can.",
    "Apply thin, even coats and don't worry if the primer is still visible\u2014you can add more coats to cover it up later on.",
    "Wait 4 hours for the paint to dry before applying a second coat.",
    "Set a timer for 4 hours so you know when your screen frames are ready for another coat of paint.",
    "Apply the second coat of paint just like you did the first, spreading the paint on evenly and avoiding any drips.",
    "If you do see drips on the frames, use a regular paint brush or a foam brush to remove them.",
    "Peel off the painter\u2019s tape and paper carefully.",
    "Pull the painter's tape off slowly at an angle so it comes off without damaging the paint.",
    "Take off all of the paper as well, revealing a clean screen.",
    "Throw away the painter\u2019s tape and paper in the trash.",
    "Let the paint dry for 24 hours after you apply the last coat.",
    "If you're painting the other side of the screen too, wait for the most recent coat to dry completely before you flip the screen over and paint the back."
