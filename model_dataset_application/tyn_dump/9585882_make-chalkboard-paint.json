If you want to make a magnetic chalkboard, try a sheet of galvanized steel, but make sure that it is magnetic first. Avoid surfaces with lots of carved details, as they will be difficult to write on later. This paint will give you a smooth, matte surface that you can write on, just like a real chalkboard. It is not the same as regular chalk paint, which will only give you a chalky texture."
