You will need enough foil to wrap completely and securely around the brisket, so if necessary, you can test the amount by wrapping it around your brisket before you use it the line the pan."

Alternatively, you could use your favorite prepared barbecue sauce instead of this sauce recipe. Use roughly 3/4 cup (185 ml) of prepared sauce and mix it with 1 cup (250 ml) of water. No simmering is necessary if using prepared sauce."

          "description":"Heat the sauce on your stove over medium-high heat until it reaches a simmer. Let cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, so the flavors blend. Pre-heating the barbecue sauce separately allows the flavors of the sauce to blend more thoroughly before you add it to the beef brisket. If you do not pre-cook the sauce, you may end with a brisket that is unevenly flavored, with some tastes being stronger on one side of the meat than they are on another."

By wrapping the brisket, you seal the liquid in and keep that liquid in full contact with the meat. This leads to a more even, more rapid, and more flavorful cooking process. Make sure the foil is wrapped around the brisket tightly so no liquid can leak out through the corners of the foil packet."

Do not unwrap the brisket during the cooking process unless you are checking for doneness. Unwrapping the meat can cause some liquid to be lost, which can upset the cooking time and lead to a brisket that is drier than ideal. You should also watch the brisket to make sure that liquid is not leaking out from the corners of the foil. If liquid does seep out, carefully refold the corners of the foil down using oven mitts to prevent additional liquid loss. Check the internal temperature of the brisket with a meat thermometer. The temperature should be between 190 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (88 to 93 degrees Celsius) when safe and tender enough to eat, and the meat should be easy to pull apart."
