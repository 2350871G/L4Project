If you prefer a more precise design, you can accordion-fold the paper 3 times instead of pinching it. Fold the top and bottom quarters of the bow toward you, and fold the center of the bow away from you to complete the shape."

If you'd prefer the center to be wider, just fold the strip in half instead of thirds. If you'd like, you can use a different color crepe for this piece to create a two-toned bow!

Arrange them so the longer sides are on the top and bottom, and the shorter edges are along the sides. If you're making a two-toned bow, stack one sheet of each color. Did You Know? You can make a tissue paper bow using this same approach. The only difference is that tissue paper is thinner, so you may want to use 3 or 4 stacks of paper instead of 2. Roll the bottom half of the 2 sheets over a bamboo skewer. Take a wooden skewer and lay it so it's parallel with the very bottom edge of the stacked crepe sheets. Then, carefully roll the bottom of the paper over the skewer. Keep rolling until the bottom half of the rectangle is wrapped around the skewer. Roll the paper tightly, but take care not to tear it, since crepe paper is fragile. Roll the top half of the sheets over a second skewer. Without unwrapping the first skewer, take a second skewer and place it along the top edge of your paper. Then, roll the paper downward until the second skewer is lined up tightly against the first. It might help to rest your scissors or another object on top of the first skewer so it doesn't move. Scrunch the paper slightly, then slide it off the skewers. Push the ends of your crepe paper along the skewers toward the center to loosen the paper and crinkle it slightly. Then, slip both of the skewers out of the rolls without unrolling the paper. When you're finished, set this aside. If you rolled it tightly, it should hold its shape. Roll 2 more sets of 2 sheets each. Stack 2 more of the sheets together, then roll the tops and bottoms on the bamboo skewers. Slide them off of the sticks, then set them aside and do the same thing for the 2 remaining sheets. When you're finished, you should have a total of 3 rolls. If you are making a two-toned bow, make sure you keep the same color on the bottom and the same color on the top each time. Unfold one of the rolls slightly and create a canoe shape. Take one of your paper rolls and unroll each end about halfway. Then, shape the paper so it's narrow at the ends and rounded through the center, similar to the shape of a canoe or kayak. Don't unroll the paper all the way\u2014you want the rolled edges to show in your finished bow. If the paper does come unrolled, try wrapping it around your skewers again.
