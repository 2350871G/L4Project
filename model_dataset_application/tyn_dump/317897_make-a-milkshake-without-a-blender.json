It's best to choose a container with a lid for shaking and storing any leftover milkshake. You can also use a large lidded jar such as a mason jar or blender bottle if you have one. If you want something like a shake, you can use a drink shaker. Note. If you decide to use a bottle with a spherical whisk to help mix your ingredients, mix any powder with milk in the bottle first. Then add your ice cream."

A light ice cream will make your milkshake fluffier, while a thicker ice cream will make it creamier. However, a thicker ice cream will be harder to mix. To make your ice cream easier to scoop and mix, consider letting it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes, or heating in the microwave for about 20 seconds. You can also substitute frozen yogurt or sorbet instead of ice cream. Try homemade ice cream, it tastes great and can be easier to mix."

Like your ice cream, the thicker the milk, the creamier your milkshake will be. If you are adding any powder, like malt powder or protein powder, mix it in with your milk first.
