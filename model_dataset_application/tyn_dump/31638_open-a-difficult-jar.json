Carefully pry the lid away from the jar, working your way around the rim, to break the seal. Tip: Listen for a pop sound as you work your way around the lid with the utensil.

Firmly slap the bottom of the jar with the center of the palm of your dominant hand and listen for a pop to tell you you have broken the seal. This method is called the \u201cwater hammer\u201d.
