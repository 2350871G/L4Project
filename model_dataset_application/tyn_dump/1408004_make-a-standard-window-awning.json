      "description":"Purchase 1 inch wide by 6 inches long (2.54 cm wide by 15.24 cm long) boards to create the awning frame. Create a 2-dimensional square frame and attach an equally sized square frame to it so they share a middle spine. Make 2 identical 2-dimensional right triangle frames attached to the ends of your square frame. This makes a 3-dimensional right triangle frame. Attach a perpendicular board from the middle spine. This board will attach to the house for support. Affix metal elbow joints to each angle on the frame for sturdiness. Place 3 metal brackets on the interior side of the frame for attaching to the house."
