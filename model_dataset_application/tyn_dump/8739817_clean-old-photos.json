Only clean the viewing glass and only do so if you know which is the viewing glass. The viewing glass should be cleaned with cotton swabs dipped in alcohol. Only do a light wipe down, to rub away any unwanted dirt and grime. Stay away from the corners and sides when cleaning, as you do not want any liquid to seep into the picture and harm the image. If you purchased the image somewhere, the paperwork may inform you which side is the viewing glass. You can sometimes tell by examining the photo carefully. Photographers often used a black lacquer on one side of the glass to darken it. The image is found on the glass opposite the black lacquer. If you do not know for sure which side is the viewing glass, take your ambrotype to a professional. You can severely damage ambrotype pictures by cleaning the glass that contains the image."
