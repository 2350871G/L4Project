If the frame is very dusty, use a damp cloth instead to make sure that all of the dirt is removed. If you used a damp cloth to clean the frame, either let it air-dry or wipe it down with a dry cloth to remove any excess water."

Use a piece of sandpaper and smooth down any bumps or uneven parts of the old paint to make the surface feel flat. It doesn't matter if you remove some of the old paint in the process, as you will be painting over this anyway. All that matters is that the surface is smooth and that the frame is clean."

          "description":"The easiest way to paint a mirror frame is to take the mirror out before you begin painting. This ensures that the paint can't damage the mirror itself. Look for small screws on the back of the mirror and unscrew these using a screwdriver. Then lift or slide the mirror out of the frame. Only some mirrors have a removable frame. If you cannot see any screws or an obvious way to remove the frame, don't try to force it as you could end up damaging the mirror. There are ways to work around painting the frame if the mirror cannot be removed. If you really want the mirror to be removed but you cannot see how to do so yourself, take the mirror to a glass shop. It can be professionally removed and refitted once you have completed painting."

The petroleum jelly can easily be rubbed away once you have finished painting, which will also remove any paint that gets on it."
