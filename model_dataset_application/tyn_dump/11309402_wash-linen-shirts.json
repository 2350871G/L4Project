In general, unless there is lace, satin, or velvet lining, you should be safe to use a laundry machine. Linen shirts don\u2019t have to be washed every time they\u2019re worn. If they\u2019re dirty, stained, or smelly, definitely wash them. Otherwise, you can rehang them in your closet and wear them another time before cleaning."

Mix a 1:1 ratio of water and white vinegar and spray it onto the stain.

Avoid washing a full load; if you can, wash medium-sized loads so that the shirts aren\u2019t crowded. Linen shirts, especially the first few times they are washed, shed really fine fibers that can get caught on the other items they\u2019re washed with.

If you can\u2019t lay it flat somewhere, hang it up on a line inside or outside, depending on what\u2019s available to you. If you don\u2019t have a drying line, use a clothes-drying rack.
