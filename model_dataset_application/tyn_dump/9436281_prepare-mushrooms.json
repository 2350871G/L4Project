  "text":" Cleaning Most Mushrooms Wet a paper towel or soft mushroom brush for non-morel mushrooms. You don\u2019t want to get most mushrooms too wet when cleaning them, so soaking them is a bad idea. Instead, dampen a paper towel or soft mushroom brush at the sink. Squeeze the paper towel or shake off the brush to remove any excess moisture. Wipe the mushrooms one at a time. When the paper towel or brush is damp, gently wipe down each mushroom. Work with a single mushroom at a time to ensure that you remove as much of the dirt as possible. Lightly rinse especially dirty mushrooms at the sink. If the mushrooms seem particularly dirty, you can give them a quick rinse under running water. Make sure that the water is cool, and keep the stream light to avoid oversaturating the mushrooms. Again, be careful not to soak the mushrooms, or they\u2019ll absorb too much water and won\u2019t brown properly when you cook them. Dry the mushrooms with clean paper towel. Once the mushrooms are clean, use a piece of clean paper towel to dry them. Pat them gently to remove the excess moisture. Washing Morels Cut and trim morels. Morels mushrooms need to be cleaned a little differently than other mushrooms. Start by using a sharp knife to cut a thin slice off the bottom of the stems. Next, cut the mushrooms in half from stem to tip if you\u2019d like. Rinse morels under cool water. After you\u2019ve cut and trimmed the morels, run them under the sink to remove any dirt or insects.

Once the morels are clean, use a clean paper towel to dry them thoroughly. Because they\u2019ve already been cut, you can use them immediately or store them in the fridge. Cutting Mushrooms Trim the mushroom stems. When the mushrooms are clean, place them on a cutting board or other safe cutting surface. Use a sharp knife to cut off the mushrooms\u2019 stems. This removes the woody, dried out part of the mushrooms and creates a flat base that makes it easier to slice or chop them. Cut the mushrooms into halves. Once you\u2019ve removed the stems, use the knife to cut the mushrooms down the center. Depending on the recipe that you\u2019re using, you may want to then quarter them. When you\u2019re cutting mushrooms, avoid using a serrated knife, which can tear at the mushrooms. Slice or chop the mushrooms as the recipe dictates. When the mushrooms are halved, use the knife to cut them as your recipe requires. Some may call for thin slices, while others may require chopped or diced mushrooms. Readying Mushrooms for Stuffing Twist the stems off the mushrooms. If you\u2019re making stuffed mushrooms, you don\u2019t need to cut them first.

Fill each mushroom with your desired stuffing. When you\u2019ve removed the stems and gills if necessary, the mushrooms are ready for filling. Add a spoonful of your desired stuffing and cook according to your recipe. Cooking with Mushrooms Saute mushrooms. Sauteed mushrooms can make a tasty side dish or topping for sandwiches.

This indicates that they\u2019re fresh. If they\u2019re mushy or shriveled, they may be spoiled. Avoid mushrooms that have bruises, spots, or a slimy texture. If you\u2019re buying white mushrooms, make sure that the gills on the underside are tightly closed. Place unwashed mushrooms in non-plastic packaging for storage.
