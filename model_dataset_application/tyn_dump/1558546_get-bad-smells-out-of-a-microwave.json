This may start a fire and/or damage the inner-workings of your appliance, leaving you with far worse problems than a bad smell. Don\u2019t put any kind of metal into the microwave\u2014both aluminum foil and metal utensils can damage your appliance."

          "headline":"Heat up white vinegar mixed with water to remove any bad smells.",
          "description":"Boil 1 cup (0.24 L) of water and 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of white vinegar by heating it in the microwave for at least 4 minutes. Once the mixture is steaming, let it sit for another 5 minutes before you open the door and wipe out the inside with a damp rag or paper towel. You can use a mixture of soap and water to clean out the microwave. After the microwave boils the water for four minutes, let the bowl stay in the microwave for another 15 to cool off and keep freshening up the scent. Depending on the wattage of your microwave, it might take less than 4 minutes for the vinegar mixture to boil. Check the user manual for your microwave to see if the manufacturer lists any recommended heating times."

          "headline":"Deodorize your microwave with lemon juice if you don\u2019t want to use vinegar.",
          "description":"Stir 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of lemon juice and 1 cup (0.24 L) of water into a small bowl, and heat the solution for 4 minutes or until it\u2019s boiling. Keep the door closed for 5 minutes to let the mixture cool down, and to let the steam spread throughout the smelly microwave. A single lemon slice contains about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of juice. You\u2019ll need half of a lime to get the same amount. As an alternative, place 2-4 lemon slices on the bottom of a small container filled with 1 cup (0.24 L) of water. Microwave the mixture for 4 minutes, or until it reaches a boiling, steaming temperature. You can use lime, orange, or any other type of citrus juice if you\u2019d prefer not to use lemon."

          "headline":"Remove bad stains and smells with baking soda if you\u2019d prefer a less acidic method.",
          "description":"Dip a sponge or rag into the mixture of 5 teaspoons (25 mL) of baking soda and 1 US quart (0.95 L) of warm water. Use this solution to thoroughly scrub all parts of the microwave. Clean the appliance by wiping in a circular motion. If splattered food has solidified inside of the microwave, apply 0.5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of baking soda to a sponge or cloth to attack the stain more directly. This method accomplishes 2 things at once, as it allows you to clean and freshen your microwave!"

This won\u2019t just remove bad odors, but it will also leave your microwave smelling like fresh coffee! This method works best with coffee grounds that have already been used."

Don\u2019t take the bowl out right away\u2014while the mixture is still hot, let the steam spread throughout the microwave to overwhelm all of the bad odors.

There\u2019s no heating involved for this method\u2014instead, you\u2019ll shut the door and leave the cloves to sit all night.

As the fruit heats up, their scent will begin to spread through the microwave, thus cancelling out any bad odors. You can use any kind of berry for this. Make sure you like the scent of whichever fruit you choose to microwave. Try to keep the plastic wrap from touching any of the berries. This helps keep the berries smelling fresh, even if the plastic wrap melts."
