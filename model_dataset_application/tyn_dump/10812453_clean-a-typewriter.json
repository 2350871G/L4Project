This protects your work surface from any dust, dirt, or products that may drip during the cleaning process. It also makes cleaning up your work surface easier. Alternatively, place the typewriter on an old sheet or towel. Not all typewriters have a carrying case. How often you need to dust your typewriter depends on how dirty it is and how often it's used. If you use your typewriter daily, aim for once every 2-3 weeks."

          "description":"Getting rid of dust is one of the largest tasks of cleaning a typewriter. Hold the vacuum cleaner extension arm 6 in (15 cm) directly above the machine and run the paintbrush over the area. Work your way around the machine with the paintbrush and vacuum cleaner to free up and remove the dust from all of the surfaces, key faces, and crevices. You can find a variety of small paintbrushes at craft stores. Pick one with very soft bristles. Alternatively, you can use a toothbrush instead of a paintbrush. However, only use a toothbrush on modern typewriters and not antiques. This is because the bristles may be too rough, which can cause paint to flake off older machines. Try to use a toothbrush labeled \"very soft\" if possible."

Scrub all sides of the key mechanism with the brush and rubbing alcohol to get it running smoothly again. When scrubbing the key mechanisms, try to scrub in between each one as much as possible. The key mechanisms are visible at the front of the machine, just below the platen. This is the rubber roller that supports the paper in the typewriter. Cotton tips (which are the same as cotton swabs) can also be useful if a toothbrush or paintbrush isn\u2019t effective. You shouldn't need to deep-clean your typewriter very often, as it typically only needs to be deep-cleaned if you notice a problem starting.

Only oil the internal mechanisms once you have removed the dust with a vacuum cleaner first. The internal mechanisms of typewriters can look complicated. The easiest way to find the pivotal joints is to hold down the space bar, backspace key, and shift key individually, and watch from underneath to see which joints move."
