Crochet 1 chain between each double crochet stitch and make a chain of 3 after each V. Chain 1 and double crochet into the same chain. Make a chain of 1 and repeat the double crochet stitch sequence to work a second stitch into the fifth chain. The 2 double crochet stitches divided by a chain count as 1 V-stitch. Skip 2 and work another V-stitch into the next chain. Do not crochet into the next stitch after you complete the second double crochet stitch. Skip the next 2 stitches, double crochet 1, make a chain of 1, and then work 1 more double crochet stitch into the same stitch. If you\u2019re working in the round, crochet a total of 4 V-stitches into the center of the chain of 4 circle. Don\u2019t crochet into the chains. Continue the sequence until you get to the second to last chain. Once you only have 2 chains left to work, skip a chain. Then, work 1 double crochet stitch into the last stitch. Do not work 2 double crochet stitches into this stitch. The last stitch in each row will only get 1 stitch. This will help to keep the edges flat. Working the Second Row Turn your work around, chain 3, and skip the next 2 stitches. To begin the second row, turn your work around and make a chain of 3. This will count as 1 double crochet stitch.
