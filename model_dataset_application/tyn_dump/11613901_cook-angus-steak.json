Other seasonings that go well with steak are cumin, garlic, oregano, mustard powder, thyme, and sage. For more spice, add some cayenne pepper. If you prefer your steak marinated, use a store-bought or homemade marinade of your choice. Leave the steak marinate for 12-24 hours before cooking it."

Wait a few minutes for the temperature to rise, then start grilling. If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, then prepare one chimney-full of charcoal and pour it out.

If you're cooking multiple steaks, leave 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) between each steak so the sides cook properly. Cook the first side of the steak the same way regardless of how cooked you want it. After flipping the steaks, you\u2019ll cook until it reaches your desired level of doneness."

          "description":"The amount of time depends on how well-done you want the steak. For a rare steak, let it cook 3 minutes on the second side. 3-5 minutes gives a medium-rare finish. 5-7 minutes makes it medium to medium-well, and 10 minutes makes it well-done. Remove the steak when it reaches your desired doneness. If you have a cooking thermometer, you can also use this to track the steak\u2019s cooking level. An internal temperature of 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C) indicates rare, 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C) is medium-rare, 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) is medium, 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) is medium-well, and 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C) is well.

    "After 5 minutes, cut and serve the steak.",
    "If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.",
    "Cooking in the Oven Preheat the oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C).",
    "Cooking steaks in the oven requires a high heat.",
    "Set the temperature and give it 10-20 minutes to preheat.",
    "Set the oven first so it has time to heat up while you prepare the steak.",
    "Rub olive oil salt, and pepper onto the steak.",
    "Pour some extra virgin olive oil into a bowl.",
    "Dip a cooking brush into it and spread the oil on both sides of the steak.",
    "Then sprinkle salt and fresh pepper on both sides as well.",
    "Other seasonings that go well with steak are cumin, garlic, oregano, mustard powder, thyme, and sage.",
    "Most steaks cook fine in the oven.",
    "Try thicker varieties and cuts so they don\u2019t dry out.",
    "Heat the skillet over a high flame before placing the steak on it.",
    "A hot skillet gives the steak a nice sear before it cooks through.",
    "Place the skillet on the stovetop over a high flame.",
    "Heat it until drops of water evaporate immediately when you sprinkle them on.",
    "You could also place the skillet under the broiler in the oven while it preheats.",
    "Sear the steak on each side for 30 seconds.",
    "Take the steak and place it down on the hot skillet.",
    "Let it sit on one side for 30 seconds, then flip it.",
    "Wait another 30 seconds to give the steak a crispy exterior.",
    "Place the skillet in the oven and cook the steak for 10 minutes.",
    "After searing the steak, open the oven and place it inside.",
    "Use a thick oven mitt to transfer the steak so you don\u2019t burn yourself.",
    "10 minutes of cooking gives you a medium steak.",
    "Subtract 2 minutes for a medium-rare steak, or add 2 for a well-done one.",
    "You can also go by the steak\u2019s internal temperature.",
    "The guide is that 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C) indicates rare, 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C) is medium-rare, 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) is medium, 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) is medium-well, and 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C) is well.",
    "Remove the steak when it reaches your desired level.",
    "If the steak is less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, cook it for 5-7 minutes instead.",
    "Otherwise it could overcook and dry out.",
    "Remove the steak and let it rest for 5 minutes.",
    "This allows the meat to reabsorb all the juices.",
    "Place the steak on a plate or cutting board and wait 5 minutes.",
    "Then cut and serve it.",
    "Save your leftovers.",
    "Cooked steak can last 3-4 days in the refrigerator as long as you keep it in an airtight container."
