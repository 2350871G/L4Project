Examine the gasket on your refrigerator to determine how it is held in place. The gasket may have adhesive strips, screws, or clips that fasten it to the refrigerator door panel. Use the appropriate tools or methods to remove the defective gasket. For example, if the gasket is held in place by screws, use a screwdriver to remove the screws. If adhesive strips are in place, use a putty knife to pry the gasket away from the refrigerator door panel. Pull the gasket away from the door panel one side at a time. This will allow you to verify that all fastening components have been completely removed, preventing pieces of the gasket from breaking off and being left on the door panel otherwise."
