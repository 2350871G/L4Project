Make the bow as tight as possible so the bundle of roses won\u2019t come apart once it\u2019s hanged. If you don\u2019t have twine, a rubber band will work just as well.

    "Simply pour water into the mold and then pour that water into your measuring cup to see how much liquid there is.",
    "You can buy molds at most craft stores or online.",
    "Plastic molds work just fine, but you could also invest in latex-rubber molds, which are more flexible and easier to remove once the resin is set.Tip: Make sure the mold you chose is deep enough to contain the rose you want to preserve.",
    "Choose one that is at least 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) deep.",
    "Pour enough resin into the disposable measuring cup to fill the mold.",
    "You can buy disposable measuring cups online, at craft stores, or at most local grocery stores.",
    "Look for ones that include measurements on the side so that it\u2019s easy to pour the right amount of resin.",
    "Because the resin is so hard to clean off, disposable measuring cups guarantee that you won\u2019t accidentally ruin your normal measuring cups.",
    "Add the catalyst to the resin per the instructions on the resin container.",
    "In general, the catalyst makes up 1-2% of the total volume of the resin, so if your mold holds 4 ounces (110 g), you would need to add about 16 drops of resin.",
    "The resin container should have a chart on the back that gives you a breakdown of how much to use.",
    "The catalyst heats the resin and helps it harden, or cure.",
    "Without it, your mold would never harden into a beautiful keepsake.",
    "Stir the resin and catalyst with a wooden skewer for 60 seconds.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a wooden skewer, use something else that is also disposable, like a plastic spoon or popsicle stick.",
    "It\u2019s important you mix things well so that the catalyst gets activated.",
    "Creating the Mold Pour the stirred resin into the mold.",
    "After stirring together the catalyst and resin for 60 seconds, carefully pour the mixture into the mold you\u2019ve chosen for your roses.",
    "Be careful to not drip the resin onto your work surface or get it onto the edges of the mold itself.",
    "If you\u2019re worried about spills, lay some old newspaper underneath your work station.",
    "Place the rose into the resin in the design that you want.",
    "Depending on the type of mold you chose, be aware of which side will be the top.",
    "For example, if you\u2019re using a domed mold, you\u2019ll want to insert the rose into the resin facedown so that it\u2019ll be visible once it\u2019s right-side up.",
    "Use the wooden skewer to push the rose into place.",
    "The rose will most likely rise to the top of the resin, and that is okay.",
    "Right now, focus on getting it into a general placement.",
    "You\u2019ll have a chance to push it deeper in a little while.",
    "This is also the time to add the dried leaves if you saved any.",
    "You could also add other dried flowers.",
    "Set a timer for 10 minutes and let the resin set to a gel-like consistency.",
    "If after 10 minutes the resin is still very liquid-like, set the timer for an additional 10 minutes.",
    "You want the resin to be pliable so you can push the rose in further without it popping back up but not so hard that you can\u2019t make any adjustments.",
    "If you\u2019re working indoors or in a humid climate, it may take closer to 30 minutes for the resin to get to the right consistency.",
    "Finalize the positioning once the resin is the right consistency.",
    "Use your wooden skewer to push the rose deeper into the resin.",
    "If it floated off to the side, you can also push it back into place.",
    "Use this time to arrange any other flowers or leaves that are in the mold.",
    "It\u2019s very hard to make roses look bad.",
    "Even if things are off-center a little, the end result will still look beautiful.",
    "Let the resin set for about 4 hours or until it is completely hardened.",
    "Consult the back of the resin container to see how long they recommend for the curing process.",
    "It usually takes several hours, but if you made a really large or deep mold, it could take longer.",
    "If the resin is still sticky to the touch, it\u2019s not done.",
    "When it\u2019s fully dry, it should be smooth and hard.",
    "Remove the mold from the resin to reveal your creation!",
    "Loosen the mold from around the resin to pop it out, or peel away the mold if you used a flexible one.",
    "Use your mold as a decorative accent around your home, as a paperweight, or give it away as a gift.",
    "The molds should come away clean, which means you can reuse them to make even more!"
