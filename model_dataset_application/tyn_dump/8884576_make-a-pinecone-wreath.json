You\u2019ll need around 40-60 pinecones, depending on how tightly you bunch them on the hanger. If you pick up pinecones from outdoors, it\u2019s a good idea to bake them in the oven at 200\u2109 (93\u2103) for about 20 minutes. This kills bugs and crystallizes the pine tar, which reduces the mess of the wreath. Break or cut stems from the bottom of the pinecones."

Use a hot glue gun to attach one bead to the bottom of each pinecone. When you glue the beads, make sure to glue the side of the bead to pinecone so the hole can be strung onto the coat hanger."
