  "text":" Washing in a Machine Load the burlap into your washing machine without any other laundry. It\u2019s best to machine wash burlap by itself since it produces lots of lint. Otherwise, all your other laundry will be covered with tiny burlap fibers. If you\u2019re washing a lot of burlap, you may need to do more than 1 load. Add half the amount of laundry detergent you\u2019d use for a normal load. When machine washing burlap, you don\u2019t need as much detergent as you do for regular loads of laundry. Any kind of laundry detergent will work \u2014 just pour it in the machine with the burlap. Wash the burlap on a delicate setting with warm water. It\u2019s important that you use a delicate setting on your washing machine so the burlap doesn\u2019t fray and unravel. Let the burlap run through a full cycle in the washing machine.

Shake the dried burlap to remove any excess lint. If your burlap has a lot of lint on it after washing it, take it outside and shake it repeatedly. If any lint remains, go over the burlap with a lint roller. Washing by Hand Start filling up a sink or tub with warm water. If you\u2019re washing a lot of burlap, go with a tub so there\u2019s enough room for all of it. Otherwise, a large sink will work. Pour a cap-full of laundry detergent into the water as it\u2019s filling up. You want to pour in the detergent while the water is running so it gets sudsy. Once the sink or tub is filled up three-quarters of the way, you can shut off the water. Submerge the burlap in the sudsy water. Push it down with your hands so it\u2019s completely covered.
