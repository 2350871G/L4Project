Then cut parchment paper to fit the inside of the pans or spray the inside of each pan with baking spray. Greasing or lining the pan will ensure that the cakes don't crumble or tear when you remove them. For example, you could use 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9 cm) round cake pans. Since you bake several cakes you can either stack them and frost them to make thick layers, or slice each cake in half horizontally to make even more thin layers."

Keep filling each of your cake pans while you weigh them so the batter is divided evenly. Dividing the batter evenly will ensure that all of your cake layers are the same thickness."

Wrap the damp strips around the outside of each filled cake pan. The cake strips or towel will help the cake bake slowly from the edges towards the center.

Doing these things will prevent the cakes from cooking quickly in the center and puffing up. For example, if your recipe calls for baking the cakes for 30 minutes at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C), turn the oven down to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) and bake them for 45 minutes.

For example, if you baked 2 round cakes, instead of having 2 thick layers, slice them in half to make 4 thin layers of cake.

For example, fill the cake with a raspberry filling, but frost it with a chocolate ganache. You could even fill the cake with custard or cream cheese filling before frosting it with a lemon or strawberry frosting. Assembling the Layer Cake Place the first cake layer on a cardboard cake round or turntable. Cut a piece of cardboard to the same size as your cake pan and set it on a turntable. Spoon a dab of frosting on the center of the cardboard then set the bottom layer of chilled cake directly onto it. Put the cake top or cut-side down. The frosting will anchor the cake layer in place. If you don't have a turntable, set the cardboard on your work surface or a cake plate. Spread frosting or filling over the bottom layer.

Then spread the filling. The frosting will prevent the soft filling from spilling out. Stack another layer of cake on top. If you're using a cake layer that you cut, lay it so the cut-side is facing down. It's fine if some of the frosting below the cake layer spills out over the sides. Spread frosting or filling over the layer. Add another 1/2 cup to 1 cup (125 to 250 g) of frosting or filling to the newest cake layer and spread it so it's evenly covered. Continue to stack the cake layers and spread filling in between them until you've added all of your cake layers. Leave the top layer of cake unfrosted for now since you'll be covering the cake with a crumb coat. Frosting the Top and Sides Spread a thin crumb coat over the top and sides of the cake. Put a large dollop of frosting onto the top of the assembled layer cake. Use an offset spatula to spread the frosting across the top and sides of the cake. The crumb coat should be so thin that you can see through to the cake. The crumb coat will trap the crumbs in the thin layer of frosting. This way, you can easily add frosting without getting crumbs in it. Chill the cake for 30 minutes and frost the top and sides. Put the cake in the fridge to chill until the crumb coat firms up. Then remove it and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake. This layer of frosting should be much thicker than the crumb coat. Spin the cake turntable slowly as you work. This will make it easier to frost the sides of the cake. For very smooth sides, run a bench scraper against them so the frosting level is even. Chill the cake for at least 30 minutes. Place the frosted layer cake in the refrigerator and let it chill until the frosting sets. This will make it easier to pipe frosting or add other decorations without the frosting sliding or melting. You don't need to cover the cake as it chills. The frosting will prevent the cake from drying out. Decorate the cake. Once your cake has been completely frosted, pipe frosting embellishments on the top and sides. If you like, sprinkle cocoa or candy sprinkles over the top. Consider garnishing the cake with flaked coconut, mini-chocolate chips, or chopped nuts. For a botanical look, place fresh flowers on the cake. Remove the flowers just before slicing and serving the cake. Transfer the cake from the turntable to a cake stand. Slide a cake lifter or large spatula under the cardboard base for your layer cake. Carefully lift it up in order to move the whole cake from the turntable. Set it down on your cake stand. Then slice and enjoy the layer cake. Use a chef's knife to slice the cake into pieces.
