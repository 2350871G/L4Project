When you drink the shot, throw your head back and try to swallow all of the tequila in one gulp. You are taking a shot, after all. Try using pineapple juice as a chaser to the tequila instead of a lime. Enjoy the shot of tequila but before taking a breath, drink the pineapple juice. It will cut the taste of the liquor."
