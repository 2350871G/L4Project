First, remove the wires from the doorbell switch (the button mechanism), and touch them together. If the doorbell rings, the switch needs to be replaced. If the switch isn't the issue, head to the chime, or the indoor doorbell mechanism. Remove the cover, have a helper press the doorbell button, and test the chime with a low-voltage meter.

          "description":"Doorbell transformers are usually located on or near the main electrical panel. Look in the area around your panel for a small black or silver metal box attached to a beam or to the panel itself. It\u2019ll have wires leading to the electrical panel on one side, 1 to 3 screws on the opposite face, and thinner wires connected to the screws that lead to the doorbell chime. If the transformer isn't near your electrical panel, look around your heating and cooling system. Check behind insulation, especially if you suspect the transformer is in the attic. While less common, the transformer may be under or inside the chime, so check there if you can't find it near your electrical panel or heating and cooling system. It\u2019s best to have a professional replace a transformer in or on an electrical panel, especially if you don\u2019t have experience with home wiring. If the transformer is attached to the panel itself, it may be trickier to replace or require you to disassemble the panel.Tip: If you have trouble finding the transformer, remove the chime box (the indoor doorbell unit) from the wall. If the wires that run through a hole in the wall to the transformer lead up, the transformer is in the attic. If they lead down, the transformer is in your basement or crawl space."

If you\u2019re not sure which switch or fuse powers the transformer, turn off the main power to cut off the electrical supply to your entire home. Look for a double-width main power circuit breaker switch at the top of the panel.

          "description":"Doorbell transformers are typically mounted on a silver metal junction box, which will likely have a cover. The cover may snap off, or you may need to loosen screws to remove it. After removing the screws, keep them in a safe place so you don\u2019t lose them. Inside the junction box, you\u2019ll find wires that run from the transformer and another set that leads through the wall (or through a metal casing) to the main electrical panel. The 2 sets of wires are connected by wire caps, which are plastic cylinder-shaped covers."

If there\u2019s electrical tape covering the caps, peel it off first. Once you\u2019ve removed the caps, untwist and separate the ends of the wires. Each set of wires is a different color. The transformer\u2019s black wire connects to the black wire that runs to the main panel, and its white wire is connected to a white wire that leads to the panel. The green wire is connected either to a green or brown wire or to a metal ground bar or screw. This grounding wire helps prevent electrical overloads."

          "description":"On the side of the transformer opposite the black, white, and green wires, you\u2019ll find thinner low-voltage wires. They\u2019re attached to screw terminals on the transformer and lead to the doorbell\u2019s other components. Using a screwdriver, rotate the screws counterclockwise to loosen them, unwrap the ends of the wires, and pull them off of the terminals. If you find more than 1 set of wires attached to multiple screw terminals, wrap each set with electrical tape so you don\u2019t mix 1 set up with another. For many doorbell transformers, you'll likely need a flat-head screwdriver to tighten and loosen the screw terminals. You'll probably find any screws that hold the transformer in place are Phillips-head, so have both types of screwdriver handy when you make the repair. The thicker wires that run to the electrical panel carry a 120-volt current. This is too powerful for doorbells, so the transformer converts the current to 16 to 24 volts. It then sends the current to the doorbell through the thin, low-voltage wires."

If there are screws, grab your screwdriver and remove them. If there\u2019s a bolt, turn it counterclockwise with a wrench. After removing the screws or bolt, take the transformer off of the side of junction box. The transformer\u2019s wires enter the junction box through a hole in the side of the box.
