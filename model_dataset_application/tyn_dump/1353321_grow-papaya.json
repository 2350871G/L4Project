As long as the soil drains well, the exact soil texture doesn't matter. Papaya will grow in sandy, loamy, or rocky soils. If you are able to test soil pH or you are choosing between commercial potting mixes, select a soil with a pH between 4.5 and 8. This is a broad range, so it is likely that any soil that successfully grows other plants in your garden has the correct pH for papaya. If you want more of your seeds to germinate, use sterile potting mix. You can make your own by mixing one part vermiculite and one part potting mix, and baking this mixture in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celcius) for one hour."

In order to produce fruit, you only need one male plant for every ten to fifteen females; the rest can be removed. Some papaya plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they produce both male and female flowers. These plants can pollinate themselves."

Planting a Growing or Mature Papaya Plant Build a dirt mound if necessary to avoid water. If there are heavy rains or floods in your area, build a mound of soil 2\u20133 feet (0.9 m).

Do not mix with manure, as this can burn roots. Apply fungicide (optional). Papaya trees can die from disease after transplantation. Follow the instructions on a gardening fungicide and apply it to the soil to reduce this risk. Add the plant carefully.

Remove the papaya plants from their containers, one at a time, and plant each in its own hole at the same depth as it sat in the container. Handle them carefully to avoid breaking or scraping the roots. Backfill the soil and water it. Fill the remaining space in the hole with the same soil. Pack gently to remove air pockets if the soil isn't filling the spaces between the roots. Water the newly planted papaya seedlings until the soil surrounding the root ball is thoroughly moistened.
