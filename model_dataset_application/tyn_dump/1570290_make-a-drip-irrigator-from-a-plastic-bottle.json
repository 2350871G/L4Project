The hole needs to be big enough to fit the rubber gasket and the flexible aquarium tubing. You can create the hole using a drill and drill bit or with a nail. The hole needs to be about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) up from the bottom of the bottle. If you are using a nail, heat it up over a flame first, then make the hole.

The gasket needs to be big enough to fit into the hole, but small enough to fit around the tubing.

You can purchase aquarium fittings in aquarium supply stores and online. They look a little like a faucet, with an opening on each end, and a knob on top. One of the opens is usually pointed. You want to insert the non-pointed opening into the tubing. Cut the top part off of the bottle, if desired. You don't really have to do this, but it will make filling the bottle easier.

Thread wire or sturdy string through each of the holes. Cut 3 to 4 long pieces of thin wire or strong string. Thread and tie each string to a punched hole. Gather all of the strings together, then tie them into a knot at the other end. Skip this step if you are standing the irrigator up. Set the irrigator up an fill the bottle with water.
