  "text":" Making Basic Macaroons Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and cover your baking sheets with parchment paper. Make sure that the oven rack is placed in the bottom third of your oven. If you have a larger oven with two racks, then place one in the bottom third and one in the upper third. Beat the egg whites in an electric mixer. Keep mixing them until they form soft, white peaks. If you do not have an electric mixer, you can also use a food processor fitted with whisks. Save the egg yolks for another recipe; you won't be using them in this one. Slowly add the sugar then add the vanilla extract and salt. Mix in the sugar until the whites turn stiff and keep their shape. Then, mix in the vanilla and salt until evenly combined. Fold the coconut into the egg white mixture using a mixing spoon. For basic macaroons, use 3 cups (180 grams) of shredded coconut. For lighter, crispier macaroons, use 5 cups (300 grams) of shredded coconut. Consider toasting the coconut first for extra crisp and flavor. Spread shredded coconut on a baking sheet and toast it in the oven for 5 minutes.

If you have a smaller oven with only one baking rack, you can start baking your second batch of macaroons. Serve the macaroons, or dip them in melted chocolate first. Macaroons are often dipped in chocolate, but they also taste great plain! To learn how to make the chocolate dip, click here. Just make sure that the macaroons have finished cooling off first! Making Egg-Free Macaroons Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and cover the baking sheets with parchment paper. Make sure that the baking rack is placed in the bottom third of the oven. If you have two baking racks, place one in the bottom third of the oven and one in the upper third.. Combine the flour, coconut, and salt. Place the flour, coconut, and salt in a large mixing bowl, and stir them together with a mixing spoon until they are evenly combined. To make your macaroons extra crispy, consider toasting the coconut on a baking sheet in the oven for 5 minutes. Let it cool before adding it to the flour, however! In a separate bowl, stir together the condensed milk and vanilla extract. Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined. For extra flavor, add 1 teaspoon of almond extract. You don't need any extra sugar for this recipe because the sweetened condensed milk already containers all the sugar you need. Fold the condensed milk mixture into the coconut mixture. Slowly pour the condensed milk mixture into the coconut mixture. Stir it with a large mixing spoon or spatula until it is evenly combined. Scoop the mixture onto the baking sheet in little pounds. You can use two tablespoons to do this or even a small ice cream scoop. They should be about 1\u00bd inches (3.81 centimeters) wide. These macaroons don't spread like other ones, so you can place them closer together than you normally would. If you don't have enough room on your baking sheet, start filling up another one. If you don't have another one, or enough space in your oven, set the remaining mixture aside and cover it with a damp towel. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes.

To learn how to do that, click here. Just make sure that they have finished cooling first. Decorating with Chocolate Dip Set up a double-boiler. Fill a large saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a heat safe bowl (preferably glass) on top of the saucepan. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the surface of the water. Line a baking sheet with wax paper. You will be placing the finishing macaroons on this, and using it to transfer them to the fridge. Add the chocolate into the bowl.
