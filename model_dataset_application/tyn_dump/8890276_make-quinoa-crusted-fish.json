  "text":" Preparing the Quinoa Prepare your oven and baking sheet. First, line a large baking sheet with some parchment paper. Then give the paper a light spray of cooking spray and set it aside. Next, set the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) if you\u2019re making your fish to serve immediately, as opposed to prepping a meal to serve later on in the week. Saute the quinoa. While the oven continues to preheat, coat the bottom of a large skillet with a light layer of vegetable oil. Turn the burner to medium-high heat. Once the skillet heats up, add the quinoa. Stir periodically for three to four minutes, or until the quinoa begins to toast. Grind the quinoa. Give it about ten minutes to cool off, since steam from hot foods can upset the lid to your food processor while you\u2019re using it. Once it\u2019s cooled down, add it to the processor. Pulse for about 20 seconds. Battering Your Fish Slice your fish, if desired. How to present your fish is up to you, so follow your own instincts. For bite-sized pieces, slice your fillets up into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. But if you\u2019d rather serve your fillets whole, go right ahead and skip this step. Set up your station. First, in one shallow dish, combine the flour, paprika, thyme, and half a teaspoon of your pepper. Then break your egg in a second shallow dish and whisk in the buttermilk until they\u2019re evenly mixed. Finally, pour your ground quinoa into a third dish. Batter your fish. With each piece of fish, dredge in the flour mixture first until all sides are covered. Give it a shake to get rid of the excess. Then dunk it into the egg mix. Next, dredge it through the quinoa, adding pressure as you do so to ensure the quinoa sticks to it. Place it on your baking sheet once finished.
