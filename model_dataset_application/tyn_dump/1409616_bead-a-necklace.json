The length of the wire you cut will depend on what type of necklace you want and on the neck circumference of the person it's for.Typically, non-choker necklaces are 17 to 35 inches in length. Around 35 inches of wire will make a very low hanging necklace, and 17 to 19 inches of wire will make a small, Princess style necklace.
