A standard piece of A4 printer paper, 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) in size works best, but you can use larger or smaller paper if you wish. Just make sure you are using rectangular paper. Notebook paper will not be as sturdy as printer paper and won't make as loud of a noise, but still works well. The paper doesn't have to be this exact size, but it's a good size to start with as it is easier to fold. Lay the paper flat so the longer sides are on the top and bottom."

You can think of this as a bit like holding a paper airplane upside-down. Look through the outside of the popper inward. You should have created two almost diamond-shaped air pockets. When you're snapping the popper open, you'll be releasing the unfolded section of paper. Make sure you're not holding the bottom edge of the unfolded paper and that it has freedom to move. For extra noise, you can try to stretch out and open the air pockets a bit to take in as much air as possible."
