  "text":" Separate sides Determine the dimensions of your finished box. This can be square or rectangle. Chain the length of your desired side.  Single crochet to the desired height.  Repeat for each side.  Arrange the completed sides so that adjacent sides touch.  Slip stitch the 5 sides together at the edges to form the corners.  Using stiffener Crochet a square or rectangle the size of the bottom of your desired box.  Single crochet around the edges, taking care to place only one SC per loop or row.  Continue up the sides, decreasing the stitches at or near the corners if your sides seem too splayed or loose.  Tie off.  Stiffen with starch, glue, wallpaper paste, etc. You can use a heater or fan to hasten the drying process if you like. Using stiffener Begin to crochet in the round.
