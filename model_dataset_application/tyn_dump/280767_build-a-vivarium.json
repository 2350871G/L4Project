If you need a more lightweight option, however, choose a vivarium enclosure made of sturdy plastic materials. The ideal size of the enclosure depends on the featured species. In most cases, though, aim for an enclosure in the 50\u2013100 US gal (190\u2013380 L) range. A glass tank in this size range can cost $50-$200 USD. Cages make poor vivariums because of the difficulty in maintaining the proper temperature and humidity."

Check with vivarium equipment suppliers to find the best moisture control system for your chosen species and enclosure setup. Your setup may include, for instance, a humidity control monitor and a misting sprayer to add moisture as needed. You can help to maintain the right humidity level by using an enclosure lid that is part glass and part screening. In most cases, a top that is 75% glass and 25% screening will help maintain 60%-75% humidity inside. You may also want to buy and install a vivarium drainage system that uses PVC pipe drain lines to help you rapidly reduce the moisture level.

In terms of light intensity, it\u2019s very difficult to make your vivarium too bright for the health of the life inside it\u2014so choose lighting that makes it easy to see everything inside the vivarium. Always make sure you use timers to keep your lighting on a day-night routine. Also make sure there is adequate shading\u2014created by plant life, leaf litter, and other materials inside the enclosure\u2014so the creatures inside can get relief from the lighting when desired. As with moisture and temperature control systems, a vivarium novice should consult with experts and buy a lighting system from a vivarium supply retailer.

    "For the top layer of your vivarium floor, use \u201cleaf litter\u201d\u2014that is, dried leaves from tropical plants.",
    "You can buy leaf litter at retailers that sell vivarium substrate materials.",
    "Some vivarium enthusiasts prefer to use moss as the top layer for aesthetic purposes.",
    "However, leaf litter gives a more natural look and provides shading and hiding spots for the animals inside the enclosure.",
    "You can use a combination of moss and leaf litter if desired.",
    "Completing the Environment Create a background, if desired, for aesthetic purposes.",
    "Some vivarium enthusiasts like to adhere a natural-looking background to the back wall of the enclosure.",
    "In many cases, this is done by using silicone adhesive to stick on pieces of rigid foam made to look like rocks, tree limbs, and so on.",
    "Such background materials can usually be purchased at retailers that sell other vivarium supplies.",
    "You also can cut and decorate background materials out of rigid foam yourself.",
    "Consult with other vivarium enthusiasts for advice on the best materials to use and procedures to follow.",
    "A background can help conceal mechanical equipment (for lighting, heating, moisture, etc.)",
    "placed behind the enclosure.",
    "Install a moisture system based on your chosen species\u2019 needs.",
    "Most vivarium-suited species require humidity levels of at least 60%, and often over 75%.",
    "Check with vivarium equipment suppliers to find the best moisture control system for your chosen species and enclosure setup.",
    "Your setup may include, for instance, a humidity control monitor and a misting sprayer to add moisture as needed.",
    "You can help to maintain the right humidity level by using an enclosure lid that is part glass and part screening.",
    "In most cases, a top that is 75% glass and 25% screening will help maintain 60%-75% humidity inside.",
    "You may also want to buy and install a vivarium drainage system that uses PVC pipe drain lines to help you rapidly reduce the moisture level.",
    "However, in most cases, it's sufficient to adjust the humidity manually by increasing or decreasing the amount of screening on the enclosure lid.",
    "Control the temperature based on your chosen species.",
    "There are numerous heating options for vivariums, and it\u2019s usually best to use a combination of them to get the proper balance of conditions inside the enclosure.",
    "Make sure you know both the ideal air and surface temperatures for your chosen species, and use thermostat- and timer-controlled heating elements to maintain the proper ranges.",
    "For example, you might use heating lamps to maintain the proper air temperature, and an under-tank heating mat to create a higher surface temperature in one section of the tank\u2014this creates a basking area for your chosen species.",
    "As with humidity control, proper temperature control is vital.",
    "Consult with experts to get the right equipment for your vivarium setup.",
    "Use bright, mid-warmth lighting that simulates day and night.",
    "For aesthetic purposes, it\u2019s best to go with lighting that\u2019s in the 5000-6500 kelvin range, which is in the mid-range of the warm-to-cool lighting scale.",
    "In terms of light intensity, it\u2019s very difficult to make your vivarium too bright for the health of the life inside it\u2014so choose lighting that makes it easy to see everything inside the vivarium.",
    "Always make sure you use timers to keep your lighting on a day-night routine.",
    "Also make sure there is adequate shading\u2014created by plant life, leaf litter, and other materials inside the enclosure\u2014so the creatures inside can get relief from the lighting when desired.",
    "As with moisture and temperature control systems, a vivarium novice should consult with experts and buy a lighting system from a vivarium supply retailer.",
    "Only try to design your own lighting system if you\u2019re fully confident in your abilities.",
    "Filling the Vivarium with Life Add habitat-appropriate plants, but don\u2019t overdo it.",
    "It can be tempting to pack your vivarium with 20 or even 30 different plant species to add visual interest.",
    "However, a vivarium can quickly look overly cluttered this way, and it\u2019s also easier to maintain an enclosure that has only around 8-12 different plant species.",
    "Choose plants that are appropriate for the environmental conditions inside your vivarium, as well as for the featured species you\u2019ve selected for it.",
    "Consider buying a pre-selected plant mix from a vivarium supply retailer.",
    "This is easier than buying the mix of plants individually.",
    "Follow the instructions for each plant type or plant mix for installing and maintaining the plants.",
    "In most cases, you\u2019ll need to do very little once the plants become established in the vivarium.",
    "Add microfauna to keep the vivarium naturally clean.",
    "For most vivarium enthusiasts, the goal is to create an enclosure that is practically a self-sustaining habitat.",
    "To achieve this, microfauna\u2014tiny critters that love to eat things like droppings, leaf decay, and mold\u2014are essential.",
    "The most common microfauna options for vivariums are springtails and woodlice (also called isopods).",
    "You can buy microfauna at vivarium supply retailers or online.",
    "Simply add the recommended amount to the enclosure once the proper environment is established.",
    "So long as the proper environmental conditions are maintained, the microfauna will take care of themselves and you won't need to clean the vivarium so long as everything inside is healthy.",
    "If any plants appear diseased, however, or if one of your featured creatures dies of a possible infection or disease, you'll have to remove everything from the vivarium, sanitize what can be salvaged and replace what can't be, and re-create the habitat.",
    "Quarantine each chosen animal for 3 weeks.",
    "Before adding your first animal or any subsequent creatures to the vivarium, you should isolate and observe them for illness for 3 weeks.",
    "Doing so helps prevent the introduction of unwanted bacteria or illnesses into the closed ecosystem.",
    "For the quarantine period, set up a smaller enclosure with environmental conditions that match the vivarium as closely as possible.",
    "Your vivarium species supplier can help you get the necessary supplies for setting up a proper quarantine.",
    "Check on the quarantined animals regularly, and know what signs of illness to watch for in that species.",
    "Do not introduce them to the vivarium if they display potential signs of illness.",
    "Observe the animals closely for the first several days.",
    "The first 3-7 days are usually the most critical for the adjustment of your featured species to the vivarium.",
    "Watch for any signs of illness or distress, and remove any animals that appear to be ill.",
    "The care needs for the many vivarium-suited species varies widely, so it\u2019s difficult to give anything more than very general care guidance.",
    "Make sure you know exactly what your featured species needs\u2014in terms of things like food, water, environmental conditions, companionship, and so on\u2014and make every effort to meet those needs in the vivarium.",
    "With the proper setup, your vivarium will offer a spectacular display of flora and fauna in realistic habitat for years to come!"
