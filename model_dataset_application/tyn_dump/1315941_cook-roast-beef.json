If you place it in the oven while it's still cold, the cooking time will be thrown off, and the meat could come out either undercooked or tough. A note about your meat: make sure you get rump roast, round roast, or sirloin - one of the cheaper cuts. Using the slow roasting method for prime cuts of beef doesn't work as well, since prime cuts are more tender. If you want to cook a prime cut of beef, see  How to Cook a Prime Rib Roast. Make sure the beef you get is boneless, and check for a dark pink, springy surface and plenty of marbling. Depending on the cut you get, it might have a cap of fat on top."
