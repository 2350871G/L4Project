Use the pads of your fingers or a stiff-bristled brush to scrub away clinging dirt and debris. When you\u2019re done, shake off the excess water. If you\u2019re a stickler for food safety, you can also soak your potatoes for 2-5 minutes in your own all-natural vegetable wash made from water, white vinegar, and lemon juice. Remember, potatoes grow in the ground, so it\u2019s always a good idea to make sure they\u2019re nice and clean before cooking with them."

There\u2019s no need to peel your potatoes unless they\u2019re particularly dirty, or you prefer them without the skins. If you do decide to peel them, use a veggie peeler with a wide blade to save time. Longer potatoes tend to make for better French fries."

    "For new take on classic French fries, try combining 1/2-1 teaspoon each of black pepper, garlic powder, onion salt, paprika, and dried parsley, oregano, thyme, and basil and shaking it onto your fries.",
    "Serve your fries with your favorite condiments and enjoy.",
    "Ketchup is a traditional crowd-pleaser, but you could also use mayo, ranch dressing, honey mustard, malt vinegar, sriracha, chili, queso, brown gravy, or whatever tickles your fancy.",
    "Dip, dab, slather, or cover them and savor every bite!"
