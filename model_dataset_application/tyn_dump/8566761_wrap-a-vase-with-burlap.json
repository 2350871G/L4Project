This will allow the burlap to wrap tighter and lay flat against the body of the vase. Spruce up an old, unused vase that you\u2019ve had in storage to instantly revitalize it. Shop around for a new vase that\u2019s just the right shape and size for the design you have in mind."

Unwind the rest of the roll and guide it around the vase until it meets the loose end. Pull the burlap taut to prevent it from sliding down the vase. If the vase you\u2019re using is curved or tapered, line up the edges of the burlap as best as you can and trim any corners that stick out.

          "description":"You should overlap the edges of the burlap a few inches so that the vase is completely covered all the way around. Run your scissors straight up the roll. Make sure both edges are straight and in line with one another. You may need to trim or iron the crimped edge of the burlap roll before you get started. Overlapping the edges of the burlap will also make it easier to glue them down."

Hold the edges together until the glue is dry. You can also glue the strip of burlap directly to the vase itself. It will be much more secure, but the vase will show unsightly glue marks should you decide to remove it."

Plan on cutting the ribbon a little longer so that it reaches all the way around. Choose a white, dark or brightly colored ribbon that offsets the burlap.

A short ribbon can be attached in the exact same manner as the burlap strip, while a longer ribbon can be tied into a bow. This will give you a few more options in customizing the look of the finished vase. Practice tying bows before you make any actual cuts to the ribbon to avoid cutting it too short."

For added security, go around and glue down the ribbon to the burlap. You might also choose to leave it loose so that you can switch it out for other colors and designs later. To replace the ribbon layer on your vase, simply slide off the old ribbon and cut a new one to fit. If you decide to tie the ribbon, use an extra dab of glue to make sure the bow holds."
