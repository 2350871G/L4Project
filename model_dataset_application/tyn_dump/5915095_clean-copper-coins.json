If you plan on  cleaning off a lot of coins at once, use a bigger bowl and add more vinegar as needed. Some other options to use in place of vinegar include orange or lemon juice. Like vinegar, citrus juice is acidic and wears off copper oxide on coins."

Use more salt as needed to make the solution stronger for particularly worn coins. Keep in mind that adding more salt to the solution makes it stronger. Mix in extra salt if you wish, but keep a close eye on the coins to avoid damaging them."

For a more gradual treatment, leave the coins out of the bowl. Instead, dip a soft-bristled toothbrush into the vinegar solution and scrub the coins with it."

Eventually, exposure to salt causes green spots to form on copper coins. Hold the coins under a little bit of running water to ensure all of the cleaning solution rinses off. Don\u2019t leave them in a bowl of water, since the vinegar solution and copper oxide will end up in the bowl and on other coins."

Arrange the coins in a single layer so they all have a chance to dry without the risk of picking up leftover vinegar or oxide. After drying the coins off as much as possible, leave them exposed to open air for about 5 minutes to eliminate any remaining moisture. Soak the coins in more salt and vinegar if they still look dirty. It may take a few treatments, so work gradually and wash the coins off each time to avoid damaging them. Vinegar solutions are effective for removing dark spots on coins, but they also tend to make coins look a little dull. Shine the coins to make them look better."
