Peel the adhesive backing off and stick the back directly against the ceiling. Then, slide the hook or twine on your pot over the loop of the adjustable hook to hang it up.Tip: This is the best option if you want to hang the plant directly from the ceiling. However, be sure to check the weight limitation for your command hooks before buying them. Typically, command hooks can hold 5\u201310 pounds (2.3\u20134.5 kg), so you have to get stronger hooks for heavier plants. You can also do this with standard command hooks if you want to hang them from a portion of trim or wall that doesn\u2019t have any drywall underneath it."

          "description":"There are a few suction cup pots that you can use to hang your plant from a skylight or tall window. Unfortunately, you can only use a suction cup hanger to safely hang a plant from glass, but it\u2019s a great option that won\u2019t put any holes in the wall. Keep in mind, suction cups are not a great solution for plants that are heavier than 5 pounds (2.3 kg), since they can pull the suction cup off of the glass over time.If you have a large skylight, hanging 3-4 plants from the glass is a great way to create a modern look in your home."

Loop the hanging plant over the hook to hang it from your ceiling.If you get a really strong magnetic hook, you may be able to attach them to drywall since there are nails in the studs. There are magnetic pots available on the market, but most of them have magnets on the side of the pot to hang them on your fridge or wall. These are a great option if you want to put plants on the wall, though!"

Tighten the clamp by turning the handle clockwise until the pads on each jaw are firmly attached to your wall. Then, hang your plant on the clamp or from a portion of the bar that\u2019s sticking out at end.This is a really cool option if your home has a kind of industrial vibe. You can also do with exposed rafters or strong fixtures that are built-into your wall. Don\u2019t tighten the clamp all the way. Stop once you feel a light amount of pressure from the tightening handle. If you continue to turn the handle and tighten the clamp, you may punch a hole in the wall."
