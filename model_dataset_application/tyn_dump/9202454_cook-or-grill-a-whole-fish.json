Pointing the flat end of the knife against the grain of the scales, scrape the knife over the fish's body in long, even strokes until all the scales are removed. Flip the fish over and repeat on the other side. Then, run the fish under cold water to remove excess scales. If you're having trouble getting a good grip on your fish, wear rubber gloves while scaling."

Make a cut from the tail to the jaw bone, deep enough that you can see the fish's internal organs but no so deep you cut the fish in half. Depth will vary depending on the fish. Put on a pair of gloves and pull out all the organs using your hands. Throw away the organs and rinse the inside of the fish under cool water."

          "description":"Sprinkle a generous amount of salt on either side of the fish. Apply some canola or peanut oil to a paper towel and rub down the fish on either side. This helps prevent it from sticking to the grill. It does not matter which type of oil you use. It's a matter of personal taste."

Stuff the fish with your chosen spice or flavoring until the inner cavity is full. For example, try stuffing your fish with minced cloves of garlic and four minced cilantro sprigs. If you have a bigger fish, try slicing one whole lemon and one whole orange. Stuff the fish with that."

        {
          "headline":"Try seasoning the fish on the outside.",
          "description":"Smaller fish, such as sardines, should be seasoned on the outside. You can sprinkle herbs, such as garlic or parsley, along either side of the fish. You can also slice vegetables, such as onions, and place them on top of the fish prior to cooking. Try sprinkling two tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley over the fish with a spritz of lemon juice from a fresh lemon. For a spicy blend, add two tablespoons of chile powder."
