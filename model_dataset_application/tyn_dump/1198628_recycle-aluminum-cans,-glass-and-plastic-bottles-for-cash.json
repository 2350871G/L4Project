          "description":"Container deposit laws, also known as bottle bills, require beverages to be sold with a refundable deposit for each container. You're charged the deposit for each container on top of the beverage price. For example, in Oregon, if you purchase a six pack for $6.99, it would have a line item for $0.60 representing six containers at 10 cents each. You will lose the deposit fee if you do not return the containers. You could also return littered containers or those given to you by others who chose not to redeem them themselves and have a positive cash flow. There are ten states with a state container deposit law.5 cent: Connecticut, Guam, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts and New York. California: 5 cents up to 24oz, 10 cents over 24oz. In California, you're entitled to opt for quantity counting up to 50 pieces. Many water bottles will result in payout of only about $1.16 per 50 instead of the full $2.50 (0.05 x 50) due to their thin walled light weight design(see reference for details)\nMaine: 5 cents on most things. 15 cents on liquor and wine containers; including canned wine. Oregon and Michigan: 10 cents on all containers subject to deposit. Vermont: 5 cents in general. 15 cents on liquor and spirits. Containers may only be redeemed in the state where the deposit was paid. A large quantity of them can still be sold to a recycling facility by the weight for the material value. It\u2019s illegal to go to another state to redeem your bottles and cans. Many countries outside the US also have container deposit laws. To find out if your country, state, or province has a container deposit law you can visit http://www.bottlebill.org/index.php, and look under the tab \u201cCurrent and Proposed Laws.\u201d"
