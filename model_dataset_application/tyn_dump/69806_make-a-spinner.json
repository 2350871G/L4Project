You can use a cup, bowl, CD, plate, or even a compass to trace these circles. You can use regular printer paper too, but you will need to add a same-sized cardboard circle later on as well."

Note that the cardboard circle is not necessary if you used cardstock. The cardboard circle is necessary for printer paper to help make it stiff. The thin cardboard from a cereal box would be perfect."

          "description":"You can create whatever pattern you want, but keep in mind that these circles will spin. Spirals work much better compared to full pictures and illustrations. You can make both circles identical, or you can give them completely different patterns. You only need to design 1 side of each circle. Leave the other side blank. If you made a cardboard circle, leave it blank; it will go between the printer paper circles."

          "description":"Flip 1 of your circles over so that the blank side is facing you. Cover the circle with glue, then place the second circle on top, with the design side facing out. When you are done, you will have a disk that's patterned on both sides. A glue stick will work just fine for this, but you can use a small amount of white school glue as well. If you used printer paper, glue the blank side of each circle to your cardboard circle."

Make sure that they are centered, however; otherwise, the disk won't spin. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step. How long the glue takes to dry depends on the type that you used. This shouldn't take more than 30 minutes or so. As long as the paper is no longer soggy, you're fine."

A thin string, like baker's twine, will work the best. Avoid thick or stiff string, like yarn, jute, or hemp. To make the knot: treating both strings as 1, wrap them around your finger to make a loop, then pull the tails through the loop to tighten the knot."

Use enough momentum so that the disk swings forward and causes the string to twist. Keep going until the entire string is tightly twisted. Don't let the string twist so tightly that it rips through the holes in the middle of the disk."

Your hands will move closer together as the string winds up, and further apart as it unwinds. Experiment with bringing your hands closer and further apart. This will cause the disk to spin faster or slower."

Make a mark to either side of the coin so that you know how wide to make the slit. Pull the coin away, then cut a slit between these marks. A craft blade will work the best, but make sure that you work on top of a cutting mat. You can use scissors as well. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step. The width of the slit will depend on how wide your coin is. It needs to be the same width as the coin."

          "headline":"Insert the coin halfway into the slit.",
          "description":"Half of the coin should be sticking out of the front of the disk, and half of the coin should be sticking out of the back. If the coin feels wobbly, coat the seams between the coin and the paper with hot glue. Only apply the hot glue to the back (blank) side of the disk. Use a low-temp hot glue gun. Not only is it safer, but it is easier to peel off of the coin."

Print service shops may also sell these sheets individually. Don't use cardstock. Although pretty, it is too thick. You can use patterned scrapbooking paper, as long as it is the same weight and thickness as printer paper. Avoid origami paper. It sounds like a good idea, but it will end up too small.

    "White cardstock will work the best here, but you can use any color you want.",
    "Make the circle about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) across.",
    "Use a cup, bowl, CD, or plate to trace it.",
    "If you have a compass, you can use that to trace the circle instead.",
    "If you don't have any cardstock, you can use thin cardboard, like from a cereal box, instead.",
    "Decorate the circle, then cut it out.",
    "Markers will work the best here, but you can use crayons or colored pencils too.",
    "You only need to decorate 1 side of the spinner.",
    "Once you have the circle colored, cut it out as neatly as you can.",
    "You can create whatever pattern you want, but a spiral will look the coolest.",
    "Don't use a solid color; otherwise, you won't see the spinning.",
    "Cut a coin-wide slit into the middle of the circle.",
    "Choose a small to medium-sized coin that's about \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide, and place it against the back of your circle.",
    "Make a mark to either side of the coin so that you know how wide to make the slit.",
    "Pull the coin away, then cut a slit between these marks.",
    "A craft blade will work the best, but make sure that you work on top of a cutting mat.",
    "You can use scissors as well.",
    "If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.",
    "The width of the slit will depend on how wide your coin is.",
    "It needs to be the same width as the coin.",
    "Insert the coin halfway into the slit.",
    "Half of the coin should be sticking out of the front of the disk, and half of the coin should be sticking out of the back.",
    "If the coin feels wobbly, coat the seams between the coin and the paper with hot glue.",
    "Only apply the hot glue to the back (blank) side of the disk.",
    "Use a low-temp hot glue gun.",
    "Not only is it safer, but it is easier to peel off of the coin.",
    "Spin the disk on a flat surface, like a top.",
    "Set the disk on top of a table with the design side facing up.",
    "Hold the coin between your fingers and make sure that the disk is parallel to the table.",
    "Give the coin a quick twist and pull your hand away.",
    "Watch it spin!",
    "Make sure that the edges of the disk aren't touching the table before you spin it, otherwise; it won't balance properly.",
    "Making a Fidget Spinner Cut a sheet of colored printer paper into a square.",
    "Take a sheet of colored printer paper.",
    "Fold the top-right corner down so that the right short edge is aligned with the bottom long edge.",
    "Cut the excess paper to the left off so that you get a triangle, then unfold the paper.",
    "You can buy packs of colored printer paper from an office-supply store.",
    "Print service shops may also sell these sheets individually.",
    "Don't use cardstock.",
    "Although pretty, it is too thick.",
    "You can use patterned scrapbooking paper, as long as it is the same weight and thickness as printer paper.",
    "Avoid origami paper.",
    "It sounds like a good idea, but it will end up too small.",
    "You can use plain white paper.",
    "If you want to decorate it with your own pattern, wait until after you have finished making the fidget spinner.",
    "Crease the paper diagonally to make an X.",
    "If you need to, re-fold the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner again, and sharpen the crease.",
    "Unfold the paper, then fold the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.",
    "Sharpen the crease as well, then unfold the paper.",
    "You should have an X-shaped crease in the middle.",
    "Sharpen the creases by running your fingernail back and forth across the folded edge.",
    "Fold the paper in half twice to make a skinny rectangle.",
    "Bring the top straight edge towards the bottom straight edge.",
    "Sharpen the fold with your fingernail, then fold it down to the bottom straight edge 1 more time to create a skinnier rectangle.",
    "Sharpen the top crease.",
    "If you used scrapbooking paper, it will be patterned only on 1 side.",
    "Make sure that this side is on the outside of your strip.",
    "Crease the strip in the middle, then fold the ends away from each other.",
    "Fold the rectangle in half widthwise so that the short edges match up, then unfold it.",
    "Fold 1 end of the strip along the first diagonal crease.",
    "Fold the other end of the strip across the second diagonal crease in the opposite direction.",
    "When you fold the ends of the paper towards the middle, make sure that they align with the central crease.",
    "Don't fold both ends along both diagonal creases.",
    "You want them pointing in opposite directions, with 1 end pointing up and the other pointing down.",
    "Fold the corners up so that they are perpendicular to the strip.",
    "Your strip will have a smooth side and a folded side.",
    "Turn it so that the folded side is facing you.",
    "Next, fold the corners down so that they are perpendicular to the strip.",
    "You want to have something that looks like a Z rather than an I. Repeat the process with a second piece of paper in a contrasting color.",
    "Cut the paper into a square, then crease it diagonally both ways.",
    "Fold it into a skinny rectangle, then fold the ends past each other.",
    "Turn the corners up when you are done.",
    "When folding the ends past each other, do it in reverse, so that the second strip is a mirror image of the first strip.",
    "Stack the strips together, front to front.",
    "You may notice that your strips have 2 seams on the front, and 1 seam on the back.",
    "Stack the strips together with the fronts facing each other so that they make an X shape.",
    "You should have 1 seam on the front of the stack, and 1 seam on the back.",
    "Fold and tuck the wings into the flaps.",
    "Your stacked spinner will have 4 wings or arms, like a spiral galaxy.",
    "Fold the front wings, and slide them under the flaps created by the back wings.",
    "Flip the fidget spinner over, and do the same for the back: fold the front wings, and tuck them under the flaps created by the back wings.",
    "Cut 2 identical coin-sized circles from thick cardboard.",
    "Use a medium-sized coin to trace 2 circles onto a sheet of cardboard.",
    "Cut the circles out with scissors or a craft blade.",
    "If you want to, you can decorate the front of each cardboard circle to make them look nicer.",
    "Choose a coin that is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.",
    "You can also use a bottle cap to trace the circle instead.",
    "Color the circles with markers, crayons, or colored pencils.",
    "Alternatively, glue colored paper circles over them.",
    "Don't use thin cardboard, like from a cereal box.",
    "You need it to be thick so that you can assemble it.",
    "Poke a hole in the middle of the spinner, then add a short toothpick.",
    "Use a nail or an awl to poke a hole in the middle of the fidget spinner.",
    "Cut a toothpick down until it is about 3 to 4 times the thickness of your cardboard, and insert it through the hole.",
    "Use the point where all the lines and colors on your fidget spinner intersect as a guide.",
    "Make sure that the toothpick is loose in the hole.",
    "If you can't spin the paper freely, wiggle the toothpick around to widen the hole.",
    "Push the cardboard circles onto each end of the toothpick.",
    "Find the center of your first cardboard circle.",
    "Push it onto the end of the toothpick just enough so that it is stuck, but not so far that the toothpick breaks through it.",
    "Flip the fidget spinner, and repeat the process for the back.",
    "If you colored the cardboard circles, make sure that the colored part is facing out.",
    "If you need to, remove the cardboard circles, fill the pierced holes with glue, then pop them back onto the toothpick.",
    "Be careful not to get glue on the spinner itself.",
    "Use the spinner like you would use a fidget spinner.",
    "Hold the spinner between your thumb and middle finger.",
    "Flick the edge of the fidget spinner with your ring finger.",
    "Alternate the direction that the disk spins in by flicking it to the left or right.",
    "Some people find it more comfortable to hold the spinner between their thumb and index finger instead, then spin it with their middle finger.",
    "You can also hold the spinner with your thumb on 1 side, and your middle and index fingers on the other."
