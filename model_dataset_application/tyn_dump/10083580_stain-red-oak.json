Always wear a respirator mask to avoid breathing in chemical fumes as well as wood particles from any sanding you do. Additionally, keep fresh air circulating in the room. You can improve the room\u2019s circulation by opening any doors and windows nearby. Make use of fans or work outside. Purchase a respirator mask from a general store or hardware store."

          "description":"Select a medium-grit sandpaper, then look closely at the wood to find the direction of the grain. Work along the grain, lightly sanding to remove debris and prepare the oak for staining. Always move in the direction of the grain when sanding wood to ensure a smooth, uniform finish. The grain is the dark lines in the wood, and in red oak these lines are very easy to see."

All you have to do is stir the dye powder into a glass jar filled with water according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Mix the dye powder in 50% more water than the label recommends, since this thins the dye and prevents the wood from absorbing too much color. For example, you might mix about \u20442 cup (120 mL) of dye in 2 cups (470 mL) of hot water. Visit a home improvement store to find a variety of wood dye shades. For example, a honey amber dye works well on red oak, turning it a light brown color."

The water fills the oak\u2019s pores, causing it to dye more evenly. You can also use a sponge to moisten the wood.

The dye may also darken during this time, so waiting can help you get an idea of how much more dye the wood needs. Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for drying recommendations."

The oak should be a consistent color when you are finished. Each coating of dye deepens the oak\u2019s coloring, so be cautious.

    "You may need to do this 2 or 3 times to get the shade you desire.",
    "Always wipe off the excess gel right away and let the wood dry completely.",
    "If you use too much gel, you can wipe the oak with mineral spirits to thin the stain.",
    "This only works while the gel is wet.",
    "Dry gel stain rags in open air before throwing them away.",
    "Gel stain is a flammable substance.",
    "Any brushes, rags, or clothing that touched the stain should be spread out on a non-flammable surface.",
    "Wait for these items to feel completely hardened to the touch.",
    "When this happens, you can put the items into the trash.",
    "Keep the rags out of direct sunlight so they do not combust.",
    "You can also fill a metal container with cold water and put the items in it.",
    "Seal the container, then take it to a hazardous waste disposal center in your area.",
    "Seal the gel stain with shellac.",
    "Once you are done staining the wood, apply another coating of shellac.",
    "Paint it onto the oak, working along the grain.",
    "Make sure it is applied in a thin, even layer.",
    "Let the shellac dry for 30 minutes before finishing the wood.",
    "The shellac seals the gel stain\u2019s coloring into the wood, protecting it.",
    "You can use the same shellac you may have used if you dyed the wood.",
    "Only use dewaxed 2 pounds (0.91 kg) shellac.",
    "Sealing the Wood with a Topcoat Sand the wood with 320-grit sandpaper.",
    "Wear down the wood so it can better absorb the sealant.",
    "Use a light touch, since you don\u2019t want to break through the shellac.",
    "Cover the oak with varnish or another finisher.",
    "Varnish can be used as a sturdy topcoat that protects the oak for years.",
    "You can try using a clear spar varnish.",
    "Dip a paint brush into the varnish, then spread it along the length of the wood.",
    "Continue this until the stained area is coated in a thin layer.",
    "You can use lacquer instead, which is durable and glossier but can discolor over time.",
    "Another choice is polyurethane, which can make the wood\u2019s finish look brighter and protect it from water.",
    "Let the finish dry for 2 hours.",
    "Protect the oak until the topcoat dries completely.",
    "Keep the area well-ventilated so air flows through the room, speeding up the drying process.",
    "Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommended drying time, since this can change depending on what topcoat you use.",
    "Apply a second layer of topcoat as needed.",
    "Check the topcoat layer by shining a light on the oak.",
    "You should be able to see the waxy finish on the wood.",
    "Make sure the layer looks smooth.",
    "If it isn\u2019t, you may want to coat the oak in a second layer to finish the oak.",
    "Let the new layer of varnish dry completely before using the wood."
