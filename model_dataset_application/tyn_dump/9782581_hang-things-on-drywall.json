Weigh the object first so you can pick a hook that will properly support it. Adhesive hooks come in various sizes and should say how many pounds they will hold. The largest of these hooks hold 8 pounds (3.6 kg) and the smallest are rated for only 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight. For objects that are slightly heavier than your hooks are meant to hold, use 2 hooks."

For example, if your picture is 9 inches (23 cm) wide, you\u2019d place 1 hook at 3 inches (7.6 cm) in from the edge, and the second at 6 inches (15 cm). Double check that the 2 marks are in line either using a leveler or by measuring down from the ceiling. If the item you\u2019ll be hanging has a wire hanger on the back, be sure to consider the length of the slack. You can test this by pulling the center of the wire tight toward the top of your object.

If your item pulls the adhesive hook off the wall even after you\u2019ve waited, check to make sure you\u2019ve used a hook that is appropriate for the weight of your item. Utilizing Wire Hooks Choose a press-in wire hook for items weighing up to 50 pounds (23 kg). Press-in wire hooks are designed to be inserted into drywall without hammers or any other tools. These wire hooks are sometimes known by their brand names, like Monkey hooks or Gorilla hooks. Determine where on your wall you want to hang your object.

If the object you are hanging has a mounting bracket, you may need to slide the screw through the bracket before screwing it into the anchor. Hang item from the support screw. Line your item\u2019s hanging hardware up to the support screw and fasten. If you find that there is not enough space to accommodate the hanging hardware, loosen the support screw slightly. Hanging Heavy Objects with Molly Bolts Choose molly bolts for heavy items up to 100 pounds (45 kg). Molly bolts are the strongest of your options, holding up to 100 pounds (45 kg) in straight drywall. A molly consists of a screw and a sleeve. The sleeve flays out against the backside of drywall to create a wide base of support. You will need a drill to install a molly bolt. Attach the bit that matches the size of your molly bolt. Mark the spot where you plan to hang the object. Remember that molly bolts create large holes in your wall, so choose your placement carefully. If you are using 2 molly bolts, predetermine how far apart you need them to be according to the size of your item. Use a tape measure to make the two marks the correct distance apart.

Measure from the bottom of the object to where the wire catches. Drill a hole for the molly bolt. Keep the bit perpendicular to the floor. Use the same size bit as the bolt. For example, if you chose a \u20444 inch (6.4 mm) bolt, use a \u20444 inch (6.4 mm) bit. Insert the molly bolt into the hole. Place the molly bolt, the screw and the sleeve together, into the hole you\u2019ve drilled. Some drywall flakes are normal and can just be brushed off the wall. Screw the bolt down tight. Use your drill or a screwdriver to screw the molly bolt flush into the wall. As you screw, the sleeve spreads behind the wall and you will feel it tighten. If what you are hanging requires brackets, remove the screw by turning it to the left. The sleeve will stay in place. Place the screw through the bracket and screw it back into place. Hang your item. Line your item\u2019s hanging hardware up to the molly bolt and fasten them together. If you find that there is not enough space to accommodate the hanging hardware, loosen the screw slightly.",
