This often occurs because the plant isn't getting enough light, so it grows taller and the leaves begin to space out to reach more light. A succulent with a long stem is called a leggy plant. Take leaves from the bottom of the plant, and leave the younger and smaller growth near the top."

Hold the leaf firmly but gently near the base, where it attaches to the stem. Twist it back and forth slightly, and delicately wiggle it back and forth until it comes off. Hold the leaf by the base to prevent breakage. The entire base of the leaf must come off the stem, otherwise it will die."

Leave them for three to seven days, until the wound heals and a callous or scab forms where the leaf was removed from the stem. If you place the cut leaves in soil before the wounds heal, they will rot and die before they grow into new plants."
