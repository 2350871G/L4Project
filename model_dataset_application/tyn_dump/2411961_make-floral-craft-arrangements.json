Mix it up with green foliage for a natural effect. Think of yourself as a painter when you're deciding which colors accent each other.

          "description":"Use a pencil, paper and some colored pencils to achieve a rough sketch before you visit a florist or craft store. You don't have to draw a perfect representation of what you want, but sketching it out will help you figure out what type of look you're going for. Are you looking for a natural, hand-picked effect? You'll want a variety of colors, shapes and textures. For a more formal arrangement, you could stick with one type of flower in classic shape. If you're decorating for a holiday, you may also want to add seasonal items such as cornucopias around Thanksgiving or snowmen cut outs that can be placed in a vase. Decide whether you will have a vertical or horizontal arrangement when you conceptualize your floral design. A vertical design often features a taller vase with flowers extending higher in the center and lower around the edges. A vertical design has a shallower vase and looks to place flowers slightly higher in the center and drape them out toward the ends."

Trace the bottom of your container onto the foam, then use a utility knife to cut out the shape. Place it at the bottom of your container. You can skip this step for fake flower arrangements, since they tend to stay in place without help. If you don't have a utility knife, you should be able to cut through the frog with a scissors."
