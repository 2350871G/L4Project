  "text":" Germinating Seeds Start the seeds 6 to 12 weeks before warm weather hits. Lavender seeds can take a while to germinate and should be started early indoors so that they have plenty of time to grow into mature plants during the warm growing season. Put harvested seeds through a process called \"cold stratifying.\" Place your seeds between 2 wet paper towels, then put them into a sealable plastic bag. Store the bag with the seeds in the refrigerator, leaving it there for at least 3 weeks. If you purchased your seeds, they've already gone through this process. Only stratify your seeds if you harvested them yourself from another plant. Fill a container with seed starting mix. The seed starting mix should be a light potting mix that drains well. You can either use a plastic seedling tray or a wide, shallow container without divisions. Plant the seeds. Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil. There's no need to bury the seeds, but you should sprinkle a light layer of soil over the seeds. If using a plastic seedling tray, plant one seed per slot. If planting in a division-free container, space the seeds 1/2 to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) apart. Cover the seeds with 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) potting mix. A light coating of potting mix protects the seeds, but the seeds also need access to sunlight in order to germinate. Keep the seeds in a warm spot. A heat tray often works best, but another work location may also work as long as the temperature remains around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). Lightly water the seeds. Keep the growing medium moist, but not damp, and water the seeds in the morning so that the soil can dry some before evening hits. Soil that is too damp and cool will invite fungus to grow, and fungus will destroy your seeds. Wait for your seeds to sprout. Lavender seeds can take two weeks to one month to sprout. Monitor your seeds while you wait for them to sprout. Make sure the soil stays wet while you wait for them to sprout, and keep the seeds in a sunny area. Give sprouted seeds plenty of light. After the seeds sprout, you should move the container to a location that receives plenty of direct sunlight. If no such location is available, place a fluorescent grow light about the sprouts and allow them to sit in the artificial light for eight hours a day. Transplanting Make the first transplant after lavender gets several sets of leaves. Wait until the leaves are \"true leaves,\" or fully matured. At that point, the root system will have grown too large to continue sitting in a shallow tray. Fill a larger container with well-drained potting mix. You no longer have to seed starting mix, but the potting mix you do use should be light. Look for mixes that are made of part soil and part peat, part perlite. Peat moss is a non-renewable resource, so it's best to use coir dust instead, if possible. Do not use vermiculite, which may contain asbestos, even when the label doesn't say so.

Use a small amount of granular slow-release fertilizer that contains balanced proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Place the lavender into the prepared pot. Dig a small hole in the fresh growing media that is about as big as the compartment the lavender presently sits in.
