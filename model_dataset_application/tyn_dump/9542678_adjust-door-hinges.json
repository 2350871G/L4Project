The door should now close without any issue. Adjusting Hinges on Doors with Big Gaps Check the gap between the unhinged side of your door and the frame. If there\u2019s a large gap between the door and the frame, your door may not be closing properly. Instead of installing a new door that\u2019s wider, you can fix the problem by adjusting the hinges on the door. If there\u2019s a gap only at the top or bottom of the unhinged side of your door, you\u2019ll only need to adjust the hinge that\u2019s level with the gap. Unscrew the bottom door hinge on your door. Use a screwdriver to unscrew each screw on the door hinge. For trickier screws, use a drill. Trace half of the hinge on a thin sheet of cardboard 4 times. Lay the hinge on a flat surface so half of the hinge (1 of the hinge plates with screw holes in it) is on the piece of cardboard. Trace the outline of the hinge onto the cardboard with a pencil. Repeat on three other sections of the cardboard. If you\u2019re only adjusting one of the hinges on your door, you only need to trace the hinge 2 times on the cardboard. If your door has more than 2 hinges you\u2019re adjusting, you\u2019ll need to trace 2 additional outlines for each hinge. Cut out the traced outlines of the hinge plate. Use scissors or a box cutter. Try to make the cuts as precise as possible. You\u2019re going to be putting the pieces of cardboard behind the hinge on the door, and if they\u2019re too big or small they won\u2019t fit properly. Put 2 of the cardboard cutouts in the mortises on the door and jamb. The mortises are the indents on the door and jamb that the hinge plates rest in. The cardboard cutouts should fit perfectly in the indents. Screw the bottom hinge back on over the cardboard cutouts. Push the screws right through the cardboard cutouts beneath the hinge plates. Tighten the screws all the way so the hinge is secure. When you\u2019re finished, you shouldn\u2019t be able to see the cardboard. Unscrew the top door hinge and add the other 2 cardboard cutouts.
