  "text":" Making an Envelope Template Find an envelope in a size you would like to copy. Fold up a piece of your stationery to make sure that it will fit in your envelope. Turn the envelope to the back side. Use your fingers or an X-Acto knife to carefully lift the folded edges of the envelope 1 by 1. You should have a square shape with scalloped edges. Each edge will fold in a triangle shape to create the pocket of your envelope. Trace the shape of the envelope onto a piece of heavy cardstock with a pencil. Cut the template out with a pair of scissors. To create a more durable template, place the unfolded envelope on top of a thick piece of cardboard. Draw the shape onto the cardboard. Cut it with sharp scissors or an X-Acto knife. Making a Tissue Paper Envelope Find a piece of tissue paper that is slightly bigger than the template you have just made.  Cut a piece of freezer paper that is a few inches wider and taller than the tissue paper.  Heat up an iron on a low to medium setting.  Place the piece of tissue paper on your craft table. Keep the patterned side down. To create more texture on your envelope, crinkle your tissue paper up into a small ball. Smooth it out again, before you start your envelope. Place the sheet of freezer paper on top of the tissue paper, with the waxy side down.  Place your iron on top of the freezer paper. Smooth the iron over the paper in even strokes, until the paper is hot. You can stop when you can't peel the freezer paper from the tissue paper. Place the template on the backside of the freezer/tissue paper. Trace the template onto the freezer paper side with a pencil. Cut the template shape out of the paper.  Take a straight edge and connect the base of each triangle on each side of the square. Fold the triangle in. Start by folding in the 2 matching sides of the envelope. Use a bone folder to create a firm crease. Fold the bottom triangle up and crease well. The bottom is usually flat at the top, rather than pointed. Apply craft glue sparingly to the edges of the bottom triangle. Keep the craft glue right near the edges, so that the glue sticks to the side triangles rather than the inside of the envelope. Allow the glue to dry well. Check to make sure the inside of the envelope is open and not glued together. Fold the top triangle down and crease well.  Place your object or stationery inside of the envelope. Affix the top with glue along the edges, a sticker, or choose to leave it open.",
