Once they are done baking, take the mini muffin tin out of the oven and set it down on a wire cooling rack. Allow the mini tamale pies to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Pop the tamales out of the mini muffin tin, then garnish them. Use a butter knife or a spoon to pop the tamale bites out of the muffin tin. Arrange them on a serving platter. Sprinkle them with crumbled queso fresco cheese and some thyme. Making Mini Tamales Soak the cornhusks. Arrange the cornhusks in a pan. Cover them with hot water. Let the cornhusks sit in the water until they are soft and pliable. This will take about 1 hour. Remove the husks, drain them, then pat them dry.
