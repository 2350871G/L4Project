You also want to take precaution not to stain your skin or clothing. You can use a drop cloth, layers of newspaper, plastic garbage bags, or a plastic table cloth. Whichever you choose, consider taping it down to your work area so that it stays in place while you complete your project, and make sure it isn\u2019t thin enough that the dye could seep through it. If you are working on a table, consider also laying a drop cloth on the floor underneath you, in case the dye splashes. Wear old clothes that you don\u2019t mind getting dye on. You can also just put a large, old T-shirt or button down over the clothes you are wearing to keep them clean. When you dye your buttons, wear rubber gloves to protect your skin."

Consider trying out different shapes, sizes, and styles of buttons to see which ones come out best after you dye them. This will give you options for your project. Buttons with designs carved on them make great candidates for dying, as the color varies and gives them even more dimension."

You should have a bowl or plastic container for each color you plan on using. Each one should be able to hold one cup of liquid. Make sure your containers can withstand hot water. You can find dye at local hobby and craft stores in sections with other fabric craft supplies. Rit is a good all-purpose brand of dye to use for dyeing your buttons. If you choose another brand, read the label to ensure you will be able to dye your plastic buttons. It\u2019s best to use a disposable or stainless steel spoon to stir. If you choose to dye your buttons with ink, you\u2019ll need alcohol-based ink, q-tips, and a sealer like mod podge."

To create darker hues, add more dye to your bath. Dip a small piece of white fabric or a white paper towel into your dye bath to test the color. Add more dye if it is too light for your taste or more hot water if it becomes too dark. Use your spoon to stir the dye.

Simply take a clean, small paintbrush or q-tip, and dip it into your sealer. Spread a thin, even layer on one side of your button. Make sure to get the sides of the button covered.

Consider trying out different shapes, sizes, and styles of buttons to see which ones come out best after you dye them. This will give you options for your project. Buttons with designs carved on them make great candidates for dying, as the color varies and gives them even more dimension. Gather your dyeing materials. You will need containers to hold your dye baths, a measuring cup and measuring spoons, a stirring spoon, and dye. You should have a bowl or plastic container for each color you plan on using.
