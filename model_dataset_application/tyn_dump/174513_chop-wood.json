If you choose a thick piece of wood, look for one that is knotty, as these will be more resistant to the force of your axe and last longest as a chopping block. Elm wood has a grain to it that makes it naturally split resistant. If an elm wood chopping block is available to you, you should take advantage of it. A recycled tire around the top of your chopping block can stabilize pieces of wood that don't balance well on your chopping block. A chopping block should always have yield; chopping on a hard surface can do damage to your axe or, in the case of a dangerous deflection, yourself."

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and address your wood and chopping block head-on. It is important that you keep your legs spread shoulder-width apart. Poorly balanced wood or irregular grain/knots in the wood can cause your axe to hit a glancing blow.
