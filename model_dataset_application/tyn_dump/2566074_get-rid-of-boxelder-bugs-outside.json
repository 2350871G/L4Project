          "description":"You can never be too safe when you\u2019re working with insecticides or other chemicals. Wear heavy-duty gloves, protective goggles, a dust mask, and long sleeves and pants. That way, you\u2019ll avoid eye, skin, or respiratory inhalation due to the chemicals. When you choose a product, read the label closely for specific safety instructions. Even if a product isn\u2019t harmful to humans, like diatomaceous earth, it\u2019s best to protect yourself. The powder can irritate your lungs if you breathe in a large amount of it, and it can also be very drying to your eyes."

          "description":"Before you use dangerous pesticides, opt for a safer treatment. Following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, use a hand duster or a large scoop to sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the base of your boxelder or maple trees. Then, scatter more powder around the perimeter of your home, being especially generous around doorways and windows. You\u2019ll need to reapply this treatment after it rains or if the bugs come back. Diatomaceous earth is non-toxic to humans and pets, but it is lethal to boxelder bugs. That\u2019s because the fine silica-based powder affects insects\u2019 exoskeletons, leading to their death. You can use Borax instead of diatomaceous earth, if you\u2019d like. This boron-based compound is also safe to use around the home."

          "description":"Boxelder bugs release a chemical that attracts other boxelder bugs, which can sometimes lead to large swarms. This is especially common in the fall, when the bugs are trying to find somewhere warm to spend the winter. If a swarm occurs, use insecticide to kill the bugs. Follow the specific application instructions for the product you\u2019re using, observe all listed safety precautions, and spray the entire wall where the boxelder bugs are congregating. You can also use the insecticide to create a perimeter around your home, preventing the boxelder bugs from getting inside. Look for a commercial preparation that lists boxelder bugs on the label. Common chemicals for residential pesticide use include bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and deltamethrin. Keep children and pets away from areas treated with an insecticide. Did You Know? Boxelder bug swarms are commonly found on the south and west sides of homes because these walls are warmed by the sun throughout the day."

Then, either take the bag out of the vacuum or empty the canister into a garbage bag, and seal the bag tightly shut before you throw it away. This will keep the bugs from escaping. This is also an effective way to remove boxelder bugs that get inside your home."

The exterminator will come out and assess the situation, and typically they will then give you an estimate for how much they think it will cost to fix the problem. In most cases, the consultations will be free, but be sure to check first. If you\u2019ve never used an exterminator before, ask your friends and family to recommend someone to you, or research local exterminators online to find one with mostly positive reviews."

This will help remove the bugs\u2019 food source, which will discourage them from congregating in your yard. Boxelder bugs also feed on other types of maple trees, though not as commonly.

This won\u2019t kill the bugs or cause them to leave your property, but if you\u2019re able to catch them when they\u2019re just starting to gather, they won\u2019t be able to release their scent to call others to that spot."

When you see boxelder bugs on the side of your house, near your windowsill, or anywhere else they might gather, just grab your spray bottle and saturate the bugs. This is less harmful than using chemicals to treat the bugs, while still being very effective.Tip: If you just see 1 or 2 bugs, squash them or stomp them with your shoe!"
