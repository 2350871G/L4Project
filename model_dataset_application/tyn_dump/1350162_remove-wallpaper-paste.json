If everything's already protected because you just stripped your wallpaper, all the better. Tape off and cover outlets, switches, vents, baseboards and trim with painter's tape or plastic covers. Cover floors with plastic or canvas tarps near all walls where you will be working. Remove or cover furniture with plastic tarps.

Fill up a gallon-sized bucket with the solution. Hot water and vinegar. This is great for tougher jobs. Mix a gallon of hot water and a gallon of white distilled vinegar. Try adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of baking soda into the bucket. The baking soda helps to dissolve the wallpaper paste. Trisodium phosphate, or TSP. TSP is an industrial-grade cleaner that was once widely used as a cleaner. Is it extremely strong, but not great for the environment, so try using when other, gentler methods have been exhausted. For the heaviest jobs, you might want to buy wallpaper paste remover from the store. The commercial removers use chemicals to quickly dissolve the paste.

If you don't want to use a sponge, you can use a spray bottle. Pour the solution into the bottle and spray a 5 x 5 foot area with the wallpaper paste remover. Wait 5 minutes for the paste to soften. Adjust the spray nozzle so it does not squirt directly on the wall, but it sprays a fine mist. Gradual saturation is necessary when spraying the wall."
