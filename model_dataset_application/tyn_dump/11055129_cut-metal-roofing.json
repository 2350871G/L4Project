          "description":"Find a stable surface, like a workbench, you can use to cut the sheets without moving them. Flip them so the proper side faces up before you pin them in place with adjustable clamps. The underside is flatter than the top edge, making it easier to cut across. The top side of each sheet has ridges that stick up and are tricky to cut across cleanly. Always turn sheets so the ridges are upside down, valleys instead of mountains."

          "headline":"Calculate the number of panels needed for the roof.",
          "description":"If you haven\u2019t already determined how big the panel needs to be, you need roof measurements. Make an estimate by measuring the length and width of each section of your roof. You will also need to know the size of the roofing sheets available in order to fit them together. Divide the roof\u2019s area estimate by the average size of the sheets to figure out how many you need for the project. You could look up a metal roofing calculator online to help you figure out how many sheets you need. Then, fit the sheets together according to your roof measurements. For example, if you have a 21 ft \u00d7 10 ft (6.4 m \u00d7 3.0 m) roof, you have 210 sq ft (20 m) space to cover. Divide it by an 18 sq ft (1.7 m) sheet to get an estimate of 12 sheets."

Then, note the spots with a permanent marker. Focus on getting the marks precisely where you need to cut the sheet. Any gaps in the roof cause a big leakage problem, so measure twice."

Precision is very important when working with metal roofing. Any mistake you make could cause the metal to rust after you cut it. Make sure your line is as precise as possible!"

Also, put in earplugs if you\u2019re using a saw. Cover up with long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and a good pair of boots for additional protection. Circular saws produce the most noise and debris of any tool you can use to cut the metal.

Snips are little more than scissors for metal, so you use them like you would with scissors meant for a sheet of paper. There are several different varieties of tin snips depending on your needs. For downsides, the cutting process is a little slow and difficult to complete accurately if you have a lot to do. Select yellow or plain tin snips to cut straight lines. This type is useful for most cuts you need to make when working with metal roofing. Choose left-handed snips with red handles for cutting counterclockwise, removing metal to your left. Pick right-handed snips with green handles for cutting clockwise and removing metal to your right."

It is necessary when you need to cut out the middle of a roofing sheet. The easiest way to do this is with an electric drill and a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) metal-cutting drill bit. Make the hole in the center of the part you wish to cut, then trim toward the guideline you drew. You won\u2019t need a pilot hole if you\u2019re cutting end to end across a sheet. Another way to do this is by hammering a nail or a screwdriver through the metal. Always make the hole on the part you plan on removing in order to avoid any lasting damage to the sheeting."

Get as much of the metal as you can with each stroke in order to make the cut as smooth and steady as possible. Tin snips leave jagged edges, so handle the metal carefully. Wear a strong pair of gloves to protect yourself. The snips work best when cutting shorter lengths, such as across the width of a single sheet."

If you\u2019re cutting a length 2 ft (0.61 m) or more, shears are speedier and make for better quality cuts. Also, take advantage of power shears when you need to cut up several different sheets in a short amount of time. Shears cut similarly to scissors but are electric. All you have to do is hold the shears where you need to cut, press the trigger, and control the blade as it moves along the metal. Although quality shears slice more smoothly than a hot knife through steak, you still have to be careful with them. Sometimes they get stuck, forcing you to approach the cut from the opposite angle. As long as you don\u2019t rush or force the shears, you won\u2019t have much trouble."

They are very loud and can be destructive if you\u2019re not careful. Wear earplugs and secure the metal sheeting well so the saw can\u2019t slip out of position. Saw blades wear out over time, so replacing old blades gets a little costly if you cut a lot of metal. Saw blades get hot and can damage the roofing if you\u2019re not cautious.

If the saw stops working, don\u2019t force it forward. Turn it off and take it to the other side of the guideline. Complete the cut from that angle to create a secure but whole panel for your roof."

Starting at the edge of the roofing sheet, push the nibbler forward along the guideline you drew to complete the cut. Nibblers are specialty tools, so they aren\u2019t great for straight cuts. Fortunately, you have your saw for that. Use a nibbler instead for tasks like cutting a hole for a vent pipe."

    "Using a nibbler is similar to using a saw, but it is a much better way to complete specialty cuts.",
    "You can get a separate tool or an attachment that fits on an electric drill.",
    "Like the name suggests, it takes small rabbit bites out of the metal.",
    "Starting at the edge of the roofing sheet, push the nibbler forward along the guideline you drew to complete the cut.",
    "Nibblers are specialty tools, so they aren\u2019t great for straight cuts.",
    "Fortunately, you have your saw for that.",
    "Use a nibbler instead for tasks like cutting a hole for a vent pipe."
