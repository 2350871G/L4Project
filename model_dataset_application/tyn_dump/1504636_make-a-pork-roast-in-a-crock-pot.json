Since pork shoulder is a well-marbled piece of meat, it will still have several veins of fat running through it. This is great for the flavor of the barbecued roast.

If you'd like to make sandwiches, toast hamburger buns and set them out with the barbecued pork. You can also serve barbecued beans, corn on the cob, or coleslaw with the meal. Refrigerate leftover pork in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days. Roast Pork Loin with Apples Cut 12 slits 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep into the pork loin. Place a 4 lb (1.8 kg) pork loin on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to make about 12 slits across the length of the loin. Make the slits deep enough to hold apple slices. This recipe works best with pork loin since pork shoulder will be too marbled to cut into easily. Rub salt, pepper, and cinnamon over the loin. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt, 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of coarse ground pepper, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground cinnamon evenly over the pork. Then use your hands to gently rub the spices into the meat.VariationUse 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of dried sage and 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of ground rosemary instead of the cinnamon if you'd like a more savory flavor. Slice 4 apples and insert the slices into the slits of the pork. Remove the cores from 4 granny smith apples. Cut each 1 into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices and push 1 slice into each of the slits you cut across the pork. Keep in mind that you won't need to fit all of the apple slices into the slits. If you don't have granny smith apples, use any tart apple you have, such as Braeburn, Cortland, or McIntosh apples. Put the rest of the apple slices with onions into the slow cooker. Scatter the remaining apple slices across the bottom of a slow cooker. Then cut 2 sweet onions into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) slices and place them in the slow cooker. If you don't want to use onions, substitute 3 to 4 Yukon gold potatoes. Chop them into 2 inches (5.1 cm) pieces and put them in the slow cooker with the apple slices. Set the pork loin in the crock pot and spoon the honey over it. The pork should sit on the apple and onion slices. Then drizzle 1/4 cup (85 g) of honey over the meat. Keeping the pork raised up on the apples and onions will prevent it from boiling in the juices. To add a slightly smoky flavor, cover the top of the loin with strips of bacon that you've cooked halfway. They'll finish cooking as the pork roasts. Cover and cook the pork roast on low for 5 hours. The pork should become tender enough that it shreds a little when you drag the tines of a fork over it. If it's not tender enough, slow cook the roast for 30 minutes and check it again. Slice the pork roast and serve it with the apples and onions. Turn off the slow cooker and carefully lift the roast out of it. Place the roast on a cutting board and cut it into slices. Transfer the slices to serving plates and spoon some of the cooked apples and onions over the meat. Refrigerate the leftover pork loin in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days.",
