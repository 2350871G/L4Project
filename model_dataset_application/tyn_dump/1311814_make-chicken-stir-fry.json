For extra flavor, marinate the chicken before cooking. Combine 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of rice wine or dry sherry and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Pour the marinade over the chicken and stir to combine. Leave to sit (refrigerated) for as little as five minutes or as long as an hour before cooking."

You can also use a flat-bottom frying  pan, but you miss out on using the sides of the pan as cooking surfaces, unlike a wok. You may also have trouble with ingredients falling out of the pan when preparing a large amount of stir-fry. Do not buy a non-stick wok. Non-stick woks are less than useless for high-heat stir-frying; they are downright dangerous. This is because non-stick coating is not supposed to be heated to a very high temperature, but all wok cooking happens at a high temperature. Use a fish spatula or other thin, flexible spatula for stirring."

          "headline":"Choose your vegetables.",
          "description":"Nearly any combination of vegetables can be used in a stir-fry, so it is easy to adapt to your personal tastes and preferences. Some chefs recommend choosing only 2-3 vegetables for a stir-fry, as they believe that keeping it simple will prevent the dish from being too busy, while also saving you from too much prep work. Others take more of an \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\" approach. Go with whatever sounds good to you, or whatever you happen to have in your kitchen. When preparing the veg, try to chop everything into pieces of approximately the same size. This prevents one vegetable from becoming overcooked while another is still raw. Regardless of uniform size, some vegetables will still cook quicker than others. Place all of the chopped veg into bowls, separated according to their cooking times. This will make it easy for you to throw all of the  vegetables with longer cooking times into the wok together, while keeping the fast cooking veg separate. If you are unsure of how long each vegetable takes to cook, here's a quick guide:\nMushrooms will need five to ten minutes, depending on their size and type. Cabbage, spinach and other greens will take approximately four to six minutes. Veggies like asparagus, broccoli, carrots and green beans will take between three and five minutes. Peppers, peas, courgette and squash will only need two to three minutes. Bean sprouts are the fastest of all, with a cooking time of less than a minute."
