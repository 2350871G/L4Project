To heat the water to 190 \u00b0F (88 \u00b0C), keep it on the heat until it begins to simmer and make a few pearl-sized bubbles. If you're using the kettle, pay attention to the sound.

If you don't have a tea infuser or filter, you can put the dried berries directly into the teapot, but you'll need to strain them out before pouring the tea into your cup."

If the tea tastes too sweet for you, try squirting a little fresh lemon into your tea. Although you can save the berries to brew again, the second steeping won't be as strong."
