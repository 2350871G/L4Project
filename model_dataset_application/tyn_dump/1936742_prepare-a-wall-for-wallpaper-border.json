The extra inches will help you when you need to trim and overhang the paper later. Cut using a razor blade and a ruler to make sure your cut is straight. Soak prepasted paper according to the instructions. Usually, this involves soaking the border in lukewarm water for 2-3 minutes. When you remove it from the water, pull it out slowly to let the water drip off. You can also use a clear paste activator instead of water. Spread the border pattern-side down on a table if it\u2019s unpasted. Apply the kind of adhesive specified on the directions.

Booking is when you gently fold the ends of the border toward the middle without creasing the folds. Let the adhesive sides rest against each other. While you let it sit for 5 minutes, the paper will relax and swell. If you don\u2019t let the border book, it might create bubbles when you put it on the wall.
