          "description":"Pressing a clover to preserve it involves flattening it and removing as much moisture as possible. An old book, such as an old dictionary or phonebook, will be heavy enough and absorbent enough to do this perfectly. Choose an old book you don\u2019t mind damaging to press your clover in. If you don\u2019t want to damage a book, you can press the clover between a few pieces of paper inside the pages of the book. The moisture in the clovers will be absorbed by the paper. If you have one, you could also use a flower press to press your clovers."

          "headline":"Position your four leaf clover near the middle of the book.",
          "description":"Open the book to a page near the middle and place your clover inside. Put the leaves of the clover face down on the page and fold the stem towards the opening edge of the book. This will allow it to flatten properly. Take a note of which page you placed your four leaf clover on. If it\u2019s flattened enough, it might be difficult to find it in the book later on!"

        {
          "headline":"Close the book and wrap it with 4 or 5 rubber bands.",
          "description":"Fold the front cover of the book back over, being careful to seal your clover or clovers flat in between the pages. Stretch some strong and tight rubber bands around the book to hold it closed. This will apply constant pressure to the clovers, drying and pressing them. You could also apply pressure by stacking several other heavy books or objects on top of the pressing book, rather than wrapping it with rubber bands."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Leave the clover to dry for around 1 week.",
          "description":"The amount of time it takes for a clover to dry completely will vary based on a number of different factors. After around a week, open the book up and check the clover. If it's green, dry, and completely flat, you've successfully pressed the clover! If it's still damp or isn't flat, return it to the book for another day. If the clover is still damp after 2 weeks, the area you\u2019re in may be too humid. Try moving the book to a dryer place to help the clover dry fully."

The tape should be at least the width of the clover to make sure it can be covered fully. Scotch Ultra-Clear packing tape is a great option for preserving your clover, but any ultra-clear and wide tape will work."

Being careful to touch only the edges of the tape, lay it down on a flat surface with the sticky side facing upwards. Any parts of the tape that you touch will stick to the natural oils on your fingers and leave a mark. Use the very tips of your fingers only on the edge of the tape to position it."

Quickly and smoothly transfer it to the tape, pressing it down as close to the middle of the tape as you can get it. Lifting the clover by pressing your index finger into it is an easy way to pick it up from the center while keeping it flat. You could also lift it with a pair of tweezers or a similar tool for a little more accuracy. Once you press the clover onto the surface of the tape, you won\u2019t be able to move it again. Take care to position the clover properly before placing it on the tape."

Carefully lower one corner of the tape onto the first piece of tape. Stick the 2 pieces of tape together slowly, keeping them uniform to avoid any bubbles or creases. It might help to use a ruler to evenly press the second piece of tape onto the first. This will help ensure that the tape goes on evenly and without any bumps."

If you have one, you could also use a flower press to press your clovers. Position your four leaf clover near the middle of the book. Open the book to a page near the middle and place your clover inside. Put the leaves of the clover face down on the page and fold the stem towards the opening edge of the book.

Preserving Your Clover with Tape Purchase an ultra-clear packing tape.

    "Place the clover in the center of your acid-free paper to stick it into place.",
    "Make sure you use acid-free glue to stick your clover in place.",
    "Glue with acid in it will slowly eat away at your pressed clover and damage it.",
    "Acid-free glue should be available online or at your local craft store.",
    "The glue only needs to hold the clover in place.",
    "Use a small amount, rather than covering the whole clover with glue.",
    "Spray the paper with an acid-free sealant.",
    "An aerosol photo and paper protectant will help keep both your clover and the paper it\u2019s on in good condition for years to come.",
    "Purchase an acid-free and UV-resistant paper sealant spray and coat your paper with a single light layer.",
    "Leave the spray to dry for 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "Acid-free and UV-resistant paper sealant sprays should be available online or at your local craft store.",
    "Place the clover face down on the glass.",
    "When both the glass and the paper are completely dry, carefully pick up the paper and place it face down on the pane of glass.",
    "Move it around slightly to make sure that the edges of the paper are lined up perfectly with the edges of the glass.",
    "Avoid sliding the paper around too much, as it may dislodge the clover or leave marks on the glass.",
    "Lay a sheet of mylar on the back of the paper.",
    "Mylar, or BoPET, is a resin that will act as a barrier to protect your clover.",
    "Purchase a sheet of mylar and cut out a piece the same size as the paper and the glass.",
    "Place it over the back of the paper and line it up perfectly with the other edges.",
    "Mylar should be available for purchase at your local hardware store or online.",
    "In place of mylar, you could also use a sheet of aluminum foil.",
    "However, the foil will need to be flat and free of tears.",
    "Seal the glass, paper, and mylar with aluminum tape.",
    "Carefully trim a length of aluminum tape to be the same length as one edge of the glass.",
    "Place one edge of the tape flush with the front side of the glass and run it along the edge of the pane.",
    "Fold the tape over the paper and mylar and seal it.",
    "Repeat with the other sides to hold everything together securely.",
    "Lining the aluminum tape up with the front face of the glass will give it something to hold to, but won\u2019t make it visible when looking at the front of the picture frame.",
    "Aluminium tape is very strong, waterproof, and is more airtight than regular tape, so it will help preserve your clover for much longer.",
    "It should be available for purchase online or at your local hardware store.",
    "Reassemble the frame to display your clover.",
    "Lift up the glass with your fingertips, being careful not to drop it or touch the glass more than you need to.",
    "Lower it into the open picture frame, put the backing in place, and secure the picture frame.",
    "You can now hang your clover or display it somewhere in your home."
