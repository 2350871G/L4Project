For a faster thawing method, put the crab legs in a sealed bag in the sink and cover the bag with cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes until the crab legs have thawed. It may take 1 to 2 hours before the crab legs defrost in the cold water. Avoid thawing the crab legs in hot water, as this could cause bacteria to grow."

The water will create steam as the grill heats. Arrange the crab legs in a roasting pan. Get out a disposable aluminum pan and place the thawed crab legs in it.
