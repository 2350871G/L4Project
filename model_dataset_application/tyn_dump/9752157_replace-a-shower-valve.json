Set it and the screws aside, preferably near the shower handle, until you need to screw it back in later on. After you take the handle and trim plate off, you can soak it in vinegar or CLR to remove any built up grime. This will make them look new again. Shower trim plates are usually known as Escutcheon trim plates, in case you need to ask a home repair professional about your specific model."

If your water stops are turned on and off with screws, turn the screw tightly to the left with a screwdriver. The water stops are typically found to the right and left of the valve cartridge. If there are 2 stops for hot and cold water, shut off both. Usually, the water stops will have flat head screw heads that let you turn them on and off.

If the wall opening is not at least 12 inches (30 cm) by 12 inches (30 cm), you will need to enlarge it. Depending on whether the wall is made of glass, drywall, tiles, or another material, you will need to cut the hole to size. If you are unsure how to cut the opening, ask a professional repairman. You can also research how to cut a hole safely and easily into your wall's material on a verified home improvement site.

If your valve clip is not damaged, you should be able to reuse it while securing the new cartridge in place. If it is, however, your new cartridge should come with its own valve clip. Some valve sets are secured with a retainer nut that holds them in place. To remove the nut, hold the valve while you unscrew the nut with a wrench. You can then proceed with removing your valve."

After you take it out of the wall, set it aside or discard it to keep it out of the way. While needlenose pliers can be used for this step, it may be easier with thicker pliers. It's also a good idea to spray it with WD 40. Wait a few minutes, then it should slide out more easily. This will reduce the risk of damaging the valve."
