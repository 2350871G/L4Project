You should have it in a sunny part of your house, such as in front of a window, or under grow lights. You could also prepare your own potting soil with a mix of equal parts vermiculite, peat moss and perlite. It is best to start seeds in wide, shallow containers. Wide containers such as seeding flats or trays prevent overcrowding. You can also use recycled plastic containers, such as yogurt containers. Punch holes in the bottom to help the soil drain."

Keep the planting flat in a nice warm location until germination, which should take between one and three weeks. During this time, keep the soil nice and moist. If you are concerned about fungal infection or \u201cdamping-off,\u201d you can sprinkle a mixture of fifty percent milled sphagnum and fifty percent starter chicken grit. Spread it thinly over the surface of the flats, which will help prevent pathogens. To retain moisture, you can put a plastic wrap over the seed tray. This will help to create a humid environment. Avoid overwatering the seeds, which will disturb the seeds and prevent proper germination. If you put your finger an inch into the soil and it feels dry, you should water.

At this point, they are ready to put in the ground outside or in a larger pot. To see whether the pot is full of roots, look underneath the four-inch pot.
