The piece of ribbon should be 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) long. Don\u2019t worry if the piece of ribbon you cut is too long.

If the gift wrap is for an adult, wrap ribbons, doilies, or twine around the package. You can create your own bows by tying them with ribbon or twine or use purchased bows that come ready to stick on with double-sided tape. Doilies are also a great option to decorate gifts; glue the doily directly on the gift and secure a bow in the center of it. Use craft PVA glue or Mod Podge adhesive for the best results.

    "The ideal wind speed is when the leaves on the trees and bushes are moving gently.",
    "If they are moving rapidly, it is too windy to fly your kite.",
    "If the wind is too strong or it is storming do not go outside to fly your kite.",
    "Storms, especially electrical storms, can cause dangerous conditions to be outside in."
