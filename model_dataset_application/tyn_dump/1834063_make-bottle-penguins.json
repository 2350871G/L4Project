If the cut edge is jagged, cut it smoother with a pair of scissors. For a smaller penguin, cut the bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) off of the first bottle, and cut the second bottle in half.

Hold the can 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) from the capsule, and spray using a side-to-side motion. If the paint is too thin, let it dry completely, then apply another coat of paint.

Look at pictures of real or cartoon penguins to get ideas for the placement of the white parts.
