You can use any variety tomato if it's still green, and it will ripen as it sits in storage. Place dry, unwashed tomatoes in a storage bin. You can use several different methods to store the tomatoes. One method is to simply layer them in a box or basket, then put newspaper between that layer and the next one. You can also store them in a box that canning jars came in, which should have separated spaces for each tomato. Alternatively, use an apple box with individual paper wrappers or make a small newspaper wrapper for each tomato. Close the box or cover it with a sheet to keep light out. Store the tomatoes in a cool, dark area for up to 6 months. Put them in a basement or cellar to keep them cool.
