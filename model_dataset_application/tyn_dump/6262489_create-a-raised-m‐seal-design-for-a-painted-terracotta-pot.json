The larger the pot, the easier it will be to add a design to the surface but you'll need more modeling and painting materials for larger designs. Place newspaper on your table to cover the work surface. Place your terracotta/mud pot on the newspaper. Paint the pot with either white or black enamel, coating it completely.
