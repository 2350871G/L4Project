  "text":" Making a Tabletop Craft Stable Paint or stain all of your craft sticks a dark brown if you want. Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing any harmful fumes. Use a paintbrush to apply a thin layer of your paint or stain to the craft sticks. Wait until the paint or stain is completely dry before working with them. To make a lighter-colored stable, paint the craft sticks white or tan. Add windows or details in the wood using black paint. Glue mini craft sticks between 2 regular craft sticks to make the side walls. Set 2 of your regular-sized craft sticks the same distance apart as the length of your mini craft sticks. Lay out enough mini craft sticks to fill in the gap between the regular sticks. Put a dot of hot glue on the end of each of the mini craft sticks. Press the regular craft stick so the edges are flush with the ends. Repeat the process to build the second wall. Purchase craft sticks at your local hobby store. If you need to cut the craft sticks, use a strong pair of scissors. You can either completely fill in the wall with mini craft sticks or leave spaces in between them. Build a back wall that\u2019s 2 craft sticks long. Lay 2 craft sticks so their tips are touching to create the length of your wall. Make the back wall with pairs of craft sticks until it\u2019s the same height as your side walls. Run a line of glue on another craft stick and press it down where the tips meet. Glue another stick on the other side to give your wall extra support. If you left gaps in between the sticks in your side walls, make sure to leave gaps in the back wall that are the same distance apart. If you want to add more supports to the wall, add a craft stick on the ends of your wall. Secure the side walls to the ends of the back wall with hot glue. Run a line of hot glue down one end of your back wall. Hold the back edge of your side wall against the glue line at a 90-degree angle until it dries, which should only take a couple of minutes. Repeat the process for the other side wall. Slowly tilt your stable so it stands up on its own. Make the roof using 3 jumbo craft sticks for each side. Lay the jumbo craft sticks side by side. Set mini craft sticks along the tips of your 3 jumbo sticks so the edges are aligned. Glue the mini craft sticks to the jumbo sticks with hot glue to secure them in place. Use another 3 jumbo craft sticks to make another section of roof. Cut 1 in (2.5 cm) off the end of craft sticks to make wooden shingles if you want to add more detail to your stable. Glue the roof supports to the tops of the side walls so the roof forms a peak. Run a line of hot glue across the inner edge of the mini craft stick on one of your roof pieces.

Building a Life-Sized Stable Make a base using 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards. Cut your 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards with a handsaw so you have two 42 in (110 cm) and two 65 in (170 cm) boards. Lay the longer boards between the shorter boards to make a rectangle that\u2019s 42 in \u00d7 78 in (110 cm \u00d7 200 cm). Don\u2019t screw the boards together yet. You may need to adjust the size of your stable depending on how large you want your Nativity scene. Ask the employees where you bought your lumber if they can cut the boards into the sizes you need. Anchor wooden posts into each corner. Set a 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) post that\u2019s 48 in (120 cm) tall on top of the corner so the edges of the boards are flush. Screw the anchor into one of the boards and the post to hold it secure. Screw a second anchor into the other side of the post and the second base board. Place a post in all the other corners the same way. Use an electric screwdriver rather than a manual one so your posts are held tighter. Screw in a top frame onto the tops of each post. Cut the ends of 1 in \u00d7 4 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards at a 45-degree angle so they fit flush on top of the posts. Screw an anchor from the post onto the underside of the 1 in \u00d7 4 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm). Use 2 anchors on each post to secure the top frame. If you have access to a miter saw, use it to more easily cut at an angle. Attach a 1 in \u00d7 4 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) ridge pole in the center of your top frame. Find the center of the long side of your frame. Attach an 8 in (20 cm) board standing up in the middle of each long side to create the ridge supports. Use corner anchors to secure the boards in place. Then, run a 42 in (110 cm) board between the two ridge supports and secure it with anchor plates. Place 1 in \u00d7 4 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) rafters on the ends of the ridge pole. Cut the board at an angle so it sits flush with the top of the ridge board. Leave enough at the other end of your board to create an overhang for your walls. Use angled anchor plates to screw in your boards. Place a rafter along each short wall so the top of your stable looks like a triangle. You may add additional rafters along the length of the wall if you want added support. Screw plywood to the rafters to make your roof. Set a piece of plywood on top on one side of your roof so one edge is lined up to the top of the ridge board. Mark your plywood where the overhang ends so you know where to cut it. Saw it with a handsaw before placing it back on the roof.
