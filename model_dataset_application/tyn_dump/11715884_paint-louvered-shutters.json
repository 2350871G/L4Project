Brush off or vacuum the shutters to get rid of dust from sanding. Use an old paint brush to dust off both sides of the shutters or vacuum them using a hose attachment. This will clean up all the remaining wood dust and loose debris before you prime and paint the shutters. Priming and Painting Apply water-based primer to wooden shutters with a 2 in (5.1 cm) paint brush. Dip the paint brush into the can of primer and scrape off the excess primer on the inside edge of the can so that the brush is not dripping. Paint with the grain along each slat of the shutters and around the frame using smooth, even back-and-forth strokes.Tip: If the color you want to paint the shutters is light, such as a light blue, use a white primer.

Brush the paint onto each slat next, starting at the top of the shutters, with long, slow strokes. Always paint with the grain and smooth out any drips or runs as you go.Make sure the acrylic latex paint you use is exterior-grade to ensure it lasts while exposed to  the elements.
