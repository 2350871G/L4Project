While holding the kale under the water, run your fingers along the leaves and stem to knock off any remaining bugs or dirt.

Repeat this with the rest of your kale. You should be able to sever the stem from both leaves at the same time this way. The stems are tough, but they can be blanched separately and eaten."

You may want to place a second towel over it or move the towel onto a baking tray to prevent water from leaking onto your counter. You can also use paper towels. Double up the layers to ensure the water gets absorbed later. Blanching the Kale Drop handfuls of kale leaves into the boiling water. Take the lid off the stockpot if you have it on there. Dump as much kale into the water as possible. If your batch is larger than the pot, boil the leaves 2 to 3 handfuls at a time. You do not have to replace the water after each batch of kale you boil.

You can use a slotted spoon to make this easier. Drop the kale into the icy water, submerging it. The cold water shocks the kale, preventing it from breaking down. You can put another batch of kale in the stockpot while you wait. Remember to reset the timer. Lay the kale on the towel in an even layer. Lift the kale out of the ice bath using your spoon.
