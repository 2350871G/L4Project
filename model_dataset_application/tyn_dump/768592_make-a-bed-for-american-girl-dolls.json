A cardboard soda tray works well for this part. The depth of your cardboard box isn\u2019t particularly important. However, the depth of the cardboard box will be the height that the bed is off the ground. If you think that your cardboard box is too deep, use scissors to cut the box down to make it shorter. The box doesn\u2019t need to have a top, as you will be removing this anyway. This means that your box only needs to have 5 sides rather than 6. If you don\u2019t have a cardboard box that is large enough, you can tape or glue several smaller boxes together."

Hold the 2 parts together firmly for approximately 1 minute, until the hot glue dries. Check that the headboard and bed base feel secure. If the headboard seems wobbly, add more hot glue.
