  "text":" Choosing and Preparing the Milk Buy fresh milk. Check the expiration date of milk when you buy it at the store. Choose milk that is farther from its expiration date. Older milk has more glycerol, a natural compound that makes it harder for frothed milk to hold its bubbles. Use skim milk if you\u2019re new to frothing. Swap in skim for higher-fat milks as you learn how to froth milk. The chemical structure of skim milk is better at holding foam at room temperature. As a shortcut, you can use whatever type of milk you prefer for your drink and then spoon skim foam on top. Pour your milk into the carafe of your manual frother. Fill your carafe or another container (if your frother is electric rather than manual) so the milk only fills 1/3 of the volume.

Frothing the Milk Manually Replace the lid of the frother. Check the edge of the carafe to make sure the top has fit into place and that there is no gap between the lid and the carafe.

Hold the carafe firmly with your nondominant hand as you pump the plunger into the milk with your dominant hand. It may require more strength to pump the milk as the foam builds, which is normal.
