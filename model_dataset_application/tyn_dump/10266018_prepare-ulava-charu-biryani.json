  "text":" Preparing the Ulava Water Rinse the ulava, then soak it for 6 to 8 hours. Measure \u00bd cup (100 g) of ulava into a strainer, then rinse it until the water runs clear. Transfer the rinsed ulava into a pot, then add 2 cups (470 mL) of water. Cover the pot with a plate or lid and let it sit for 6 to 8 hours. Sift the ulva with your fingers to ensure that it gets rinsed evenly. Gently shake the strainer to dislodge any excess starchy water. Rather than dirtying up another pot, you can soak the ulava in the pressure cooker itself\u2014just don\u2019t turn it on yet! Cook the ulava in a pressure cooker for 10 to 15 minutes, or until soft. If you're using an Indian pressure cooker, this will take about 6 to 8 whistles. The exact cooking time will vary, however, so check your pressure cooker's manual to find out exactly how long you should cook the ulava. Release the pressure on the cooker before removing the lid. How you do this depends on what type of cooker you have. In most cases, you'll have to wait 20 to 30 minutes for the pressure to drop on its own. Drain the cooking water and save it for later. Hold a strainer over a bowl, pot, or pitcher, then pour the cooking water into it. Set the container with the cooking water aside. Do not pour it out; you'll finish cooking the ulava in this water. You need to keep the water because that's where all the flavor is. Grind the cooked ulava. You can do this in a blender, grinder, or a food processor. The key here is to create a fine paste. You will be cooking this with the reserved water to extract the flavor. Boil the ground ulava with the cooking water for 5 minutes. Pour the drained cooking water into a pot\u2014not a pressure cooker. Add the ground ulava and stir it in with a spoon. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium to medium-high heat, then allow it to cook for 5 minutes. Keep an eye on the pot so that it doesn't boil over. If it starts doing that, lift the pot off the stove, reduce the temperature, then set the pot back down. Pour the mixture through a strainer and save the water. Set your strainer over a separate pitcher or pot. Pour the ulava mixture through it. Keep the water in the pot and discard the ground ulava. You will cook the biryani in this water. Scrape the ground ulava against the strainer with a spoon or spatula to get all the water out. Use a fine, mesh strainer or sieve for this so that you don't get any ulava into the water. Try to end up with about 2 cups (470 mL) of the ulava water. Don\u2019t fret if you have a little less than that, however. Rinsing and Soaking the Rice Rinse the rice until the water runs clear. Pour 1 cup (225 g) of basmati rice into a strainer, then hold the strainer under running water. Move the rice around with your fingers until the water runs clear. Gently shake the strainer to help dislodge any excess water. Soak the rice in 2 cups (470 mL) of water for 15 minutes. Transfer the rice into a pot or bowl. Pour 2 cups (470 mL) of water over the rice, then allow it to sit for 15 minutes. Do not cook the rice. You will cook it later with the rest of the ingredients. This will make it more flavorful. Drain the water and set the rice aside. Hold the strainer over a sink, then pour the rice into it. Gently shake the strainer to get rid of any extra water. Set the strainer with the rice in it aside. A bowl would be perfect, because then it will catch any dripping water. Unlike with the ulava, you don't need to save the rice water.
