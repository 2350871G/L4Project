The pecan butter you make with toasted pecans will be much more flavorful than pecan butter made with raw pecans. If toasting in the oven, preheat your oven to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C). Put the pecans on a small baking sheet or in a small roasting pan and bake for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to keep a close eye on the pecans. They can go from toasted to burnt in a matter of seconds, so if you begin to smell them, take them out of the oven. If toasting in a pan on the stove, simply toast in a dry pan over medium heat until slightly toasted. Be sure to move the pecans around in the pan often.
