To make this process as sanitary as possible, put on a pair of elbow-length rubber gloves before sticking your hand in the toilet. If there is a lot of water in the toilet bowl, it may be easier to reach the item if you use a disposable cup or container to scoop out some of the water first.

Straighten the hanger out as much as possible before bending one end into a small hook shape. Then, carefully stick the hook end down the toilet drain and try to grab hold of the item with the hook. When pushing the hook end down the drain, try to gently trace the top of the drain pipe to avoid pushing the item further down. Then, when the hook is down as far as it can go, push it down and gently trace the bottom of the drain pipe as you pull the hook back up.
