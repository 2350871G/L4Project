To detach it, hold the shell with your non-dominant hand and use your other hand to apply gentle pressure to the oyster until it's no longer attached to the shell. Alternatively, if you're embarrassed about slurping the oyster, it's also acceptable to spear it with your fork and eat it that way."

Both methods are acceptable, although some will argue that chewing the oyster as you eat it allows you to experience more of its flavor. Don't be embarrassed about slurping the oyster; this is also perfectly acceptable! If the oyster doesn't slide into your mouth, this probably means it's still attached to the shell.
