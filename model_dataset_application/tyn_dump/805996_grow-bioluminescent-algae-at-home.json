Choose a clear, lidded container, either glass or plastic, in which to grow your dinoflagellates. It's important that the container be clear to let in a maximum amount of light.

The algae's circadian rhythm will synchronize with the light schedule. It is possible to arrange a light schedule so that luminescence occurs during the day.
