For instance, the roof of your home, trees on your property, fence posts along borders, and patio structures or awnings can be utilized to hang outdoor lights so that you don\u2019t have to create separate posts to mount/anchor them to. For example, string lights between your home and garage over your lawn. Alternatively, hang lights between your deck and posts you place throughout the yard."

You\u2019ll need to begin near an outlet with enough voltage to power the strings you want to use. Use an outlet on a circuit that does not have a lot of equipment plugged into it. If you plug too much equipment into one circuit, you'll trip the breaker and it will shut the power off."
