Cornstarch is a good way to thicken the frosting without increasing its sweetness. Mix 1 tablespoon (25 grams) of cornstarch into the frosting. If it is still too runny, add a little more. Continue to add cornstarch until you are happy with the texture. Avoid adding more than 1/2 cup (62.5 grams) of cornstarch per 8 oz (226 grams) of cream cheese. Adding more cornstarch than this can impact the taste of the frosting. In some countries, cornstarch is called corn flour."

          "description":"Cream cheese will vary in thickness depending on the temperature. Transfer the frosting into an airtight container to stop it from soaking up other smells, and then place it into the fridge. The cool air will harden the fats in the cream cheese and butter, and make the icing thicker. If the cream cheese is still too soft after 1 hour, leave it in the fridge for a further 30 minutes. If the cream cheese frosting gets too hard, simply leave it at room temperature to soften."

If the frosting is still not thick enough, add an extra 1 teaspoon (2.3 grams) of meringue powder. Purchase meringue powder from a speciality cooking or baking store. This option is really effective if you want to pipe the frosting onto a cake as it helps the mixture to hold its shape."
