          "description":"Add \u00bd pound (250 g) of finely chopped dark chocolate, 1 cup (200 g) of refined coconut oil, and 6 tablespoons (125 g) of light corn syrup to a large microwave-safe bowl. Stir the ingredients together but don\u2019t worry about fully combining them. For the best chocolate shell sauce, use 66 to 72% dark chocolate. Be sure to use refined coconut oil, which has more of a neutral flavor. If you use an unrefined or virgin coconut oil, your chocolate sauce will have a coconut flavor. The corn syrup helps add sweetness and a fudge-like texture to the sauce. However, you can omit it if you prefer."

Continue heating the sauce until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. It usually takes 3 to 4 intervals of heating the ingredients to melt the chocolate. If you heat the ingredients too long, the chocolate may break and brown speckles can form in the sauce. To re-emulsify it, process it in a blender on high for 30 seconds."

While you can purchase a new squeeze bottle at many home goods stores, you can also wash out a bottle from an old container of store-bought chocolate shell sauce for your homemade version. You can also store the sauce in a simple jar or tupperware container, and use a spoon to drizzle it over your ice cream."

Let the sauce sit for approximately 30 seconds so it has time to harden before eating. The chocolate shell sauce will keep for 3 to 4 months at room temperature, though it may separate over time. Be sure to shake it well before each use."

To use it, spoon it over your favorite ice cream and wait at least 30 seconds for the sauce to harden into a shell before eating. You can store the sauce at room temperature, where it will keep for about 2 to 3 months. The sauce can last up to 6 months in the refrigerator, but it will also solidify at colder temperatures. If you're plan to store it in the fridge, reheat for 30 seconds in the microwave before pouring it over ice cream."
