Use a pair of scissors to cut the insulation in half so you have two pieces. Be sure to use insulation that comes with adhesive along the seams so you can seal it over the wire form. If you use a larger piece of insulation, you may need to trim it further to fit each side of the wire heart. If you have pipe insulation scraps around the house, you can fit together multiple smaller pieces for each side of the heart. Just use tape to secure the seams between the pieces.
