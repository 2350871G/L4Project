Check the label on the fiber powder to see if the main ingredient is psyllium husk. If it is, then you can use it to make jiggly slime. Stir until the fiber powder is dissolved. Fiber powder is a common item in many households since it is often used as a gentle remedy for constipation. Tip: Substitute cola or another type of soda that you like for the water in your slime. This slime recipe is actually edible and using cola instead of water will make it more flavorful!"
