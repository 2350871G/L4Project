This will prevent the paint from bleeding under the stencil. Carefully peel the stencil away, then let the paint dry. If your paint is sheer, you may need to apply another coat or two. Allow each coat to dry before applying the next one. Keep the stencil in place until you apply your last coat of paint. You can apply the stencils to an unpainted pot or to a painted one. If you are applying the stencils to a bare pot, be sure to wipe it down with a damp cloth first. If you are adding house numbers, aim to make them about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide. This will make them more visible from the street."

You can buy young plants from your local nursery or gardening shop, or you can try to start them from seed. Dampen the soil, if necessary. The soil should feel damp and springy, like a sponge. If your soil is too dry, mix some water into it. Make sure that your soil is suitable for the type of plants you are using. Fill the gaps between the pots with soil. Use a trowel to scoop the soil into your planter. Stop when the soil is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the top rim of each terra cotta pot. Add your plants.
