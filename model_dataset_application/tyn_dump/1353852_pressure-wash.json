They are also more portable than electric pressure washers, since they don't need to be plugged in. They're much better than electric washers when it comes to cleaning stone, wood, and metal. Get a gas-powered washer if you need to clean stronger or tougher surfaces. Some gas-powered pressure washers emit a lot of fumes and cause a lot of noise when they're running. If you want a silent and clean pressure washer, avoid getting a gas-powered washer unless you really need the extra power.
