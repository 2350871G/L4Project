          "description":"A concrete garage floor, driveway, or basement floor is a good choice here. You can also use a workbench if you\u2019re cutting a smaller piece of hardboard. Lay the board smooth-side up, unless you plan to use the rough side as the \u201cshow\u201d side. Cutting on top of concrete will dull your utility knife blade more quickly. While the blades are easy to switch out, you can protect your blade a bit by laying a large sheet of cardboard (like an unfolded moving box) underneath the hardboard."

Keep the straight edge in place right up alongside the marked cut line, and press down firmly on it with your hand and knee or foot. Continue your pencil lines over the edges of the board, so that you can see them when you flip the board over. A large T-square will work in place of a straight edge. You can try to make curved and shaped cuts, but it takes some practice to master cutting freehand with a utility knife. You might have greater success with a jigsaw."

Use only light pressure, keep the blade right up against the straight edge, and cut in a single, smooth, steady motion. Don\u2019t stop-and-start while cutting with a utility knife. Complete the whole cut in one motion whenever possible. Maintain firm pressure on the straight edge so it doesn\u2019t shift out of place while you\u2019re cutting."

Complete a second cut, this time pressing down a bit more firmly. Make 5-6 total cuts, pressing a little harder each time. After the second or third pass of the blade, you can remove the straight edge if you wish. The channel should be deep enough to keep your blade moving straight along the cut line."

One option is to flip the board over, draw another pencil line, and repeat the cutting process. After a few passes of the blade, you\u2019ll have cut all the way through the board. Make sure the pencil lines are in the exact same spot on both sides of the board. Use the pencil lines that you ran over the edges of the top side of the board to help guide the placement of the cutting line on the underside."

To finish the cut, run your blade along the corner you\u2019ve created on the underside of the board\u2014after a pass or two, you\u2019ll have cut through the board.

In this case, mark your cut lines in pencil on this side and keep it facing up when you make your cuts. Use a tape measure and a straight edge to make accurate, straight cut lines.

Use your saw\u2019s instruction manual\u2014or check the manufacturer\u2019s website\u2014for information on choosing and changing saw blades.

Follow the product instructions for the type of saw you\u2019re using, and consider the following tips:\nWhen using a jigsaw, start with the blade at the edge of your cut line, squeeze the trigger to start the saw, and guide it slowly and evenly along the cut line. A jigsaw is your best option for making curved or shaped cuts. When using a circular saw, you\u2019ll also want to line up the blade at the edge of the cut line and squeeze the trigger to slice through the board. Make sure not to press down on the saw\u2014allow it to glide freely as it cuts. When using a table saw, use the fence and both hands to guide the wood through the stationary, spinning blade that lifts up from the slit in the table.

Instead of running masking tape along the underside of the cut line, sandwich a sheet of 0.25 in (0.64 cm) thick particle board between the hardboard and your workbench. Use a pencil, measuring tape, and straight edge to mark your cut lines, and use at least two spring clamps or C-clamps to secure the board firmly to a stable, flat workbench. See the section of this article on cutting with a power saw for more details on measuring, marking, and clamping down hardboard.

    "The process for measuring, marking, and clamping down the hardboard is the same for a power saw and hand saw, with one difference.",
    "Instead of running masking tape along the underside of the cut line, sandwich a sheet of 0.25 in (0.64 cm) thick particle board between the hardboard and your workbench.",
    "Use a pencil, measuring tape, and straight edge to mark your cut lines, and use at least two spring clamps or C-clamps to secure the board firmly to a stable, flat workbench.",
    "See the section of this article on cutting with a power saw for more details on measuring, marking, and clamping down hardboard.",
    "A handsaw\u2019s teeth rip into the underside of the hardboard when you cut.",
    "Putting the particle board on the underside will spare the hardboard from the brunt of the ripping motion of the saw\u2019s teeth, thereby reducing splintering.",
    "Clamp a scrap of lumber along your cut line to ensure a straight cut.",
    "Unless you have a lot of experience using a hand saw, it\u2019s harder than you think to cut a straight line.",
    "To help out, use two spring clamps or C-clamps to secure a straight piece of scrap lumber right against the cut line.",
    "This will serve as a guide to keep your cut straight.",
    "A piece of 1 in \u00d7 3 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 7.6 cm) dimensional lumber is a good choice here.",
    "Saw a full cut through the hardboard at a steady, even pace.",
    "Hold the saw blade at a 45-degree angle at the far edge of your cut line.",
    "Make two small upward strokes to create a notch, then start cutting with a smooth, steady, even rhythm.",
    "Keep going until you complete the cut\u2014don\u2019t lift the saw out of the channel and then try to start again.",
    "Even a smooth, straight cut with a handsaw will leave some rough edges on the hardboard.",
    "Smooth them out by passing medium grit (60-120-grit) sandpaper over the cuts several times, then follow up with fine-grit (240-plus grit) sandpaper if needed."
