      "description":"Scoop your ice cream on the sideboard next to the sink. Put both scoops into a large coffee cup under running hot water long enough to heat them up for 20-30 seconds. If you're scooping ice cream for several kids/people, leave the water running at a trickle into the cup. Heating the scoops makes it easier to glide through the ice cream and ultimately speeds up the process."

      "description":"When you have scooped out the ice cream, place it in a dish or a cone then drop that scoop back into the cup and grab the other. This way you always have a heated scoop handy. The ice cream falls from a heated scoop much more easily than from a cold one - thus using it for only one or two scoops before returning it to the heated water and grabbing the second one."
