      "description":"There are two obvious reasons for doing this: one is so you're familiar with the machine, and the other is to make sure it is suitable for the job. Backhoes are available as track or wheeled machines with either 2 or 4 wheel capable configurations.Look at the location of the operator's controls, understanding that the machine is operated from a forward and backward facing position. Look at both the forward and rear facing operational controls to make sure you feel comfortable in your ability to reach all of them. Facing forward, you will see a steering wheel, shifter, front loader control lever, brake pedals (left and right independent brakes), gas pedal, and control switches for accessories like lights, emergency flashers, horn, emergency brake actuator, ignition switch, gauges, and other items. Facing the rear (the seat swivels 180 degrees), you should see the boom controls. There are two different boom control configurations, the three stick that includes foot controls to swing the bucket, and the joystick controls, that operate all the backhoe boom controls with two joysticks. Also, there will be two auxiliary controls, either mounted paired on one side of the seat, or in front of the boom control sticks, that raise and lower the stabilizers. Look at the safety equipment. Experienced backhoe operators check the safety equipment at the beginning of each shift to make sure it is in good condition. This requires some knowledge of how the safety equipment works, but even a novice should be able to observe things like the seat belt condition, the fire extinguisher charge, and be able to see obvious damage such as cracked members in the rollover protection system and missing guards. A backhoe will have two outrigger stabilizer arms that are planted firmly on the ground before digging with the rear boon. These must always be brought fully upright before moving the machine. Look at the general condition of the machine. Check the tires to make sure they are properly inflated and show no outward signs of damage, look for oil leaks, damaged hydraulic hoses, and other obvious signs of abuse or dangerous conditions. Look at the size of the machine. Backhoes range in size from small attachments for lawn tractors, to machines weighing over 12,000 pounds with turbo-charged diesel engines. You will have to decide how large a machine you will need to perform the project you have in mind. Look at other features of the machine you will operate, like air conditioning, four wheel drive, extend-a-hoes, and the various special attachments available on these machines."
