The number of glasses you need is dependent upon how many colors you want to use to change the celery. Make sure your celery stalks still have the leafy tops on them. If you only have 1 stalk of celery, you can it lengthwise into multiple pieces. Blue and red food coloring work best for this experiment, but you can use any combination of colors you would like."

It takes time for the celery stalk to take up the water and transport it to the top, so leave the cups undisturbed for at least 24 hrs.

Break the stalk in half and see what the inside looks like. You should see the color all throughout the stalk. Write down your results as \u201cafter\u201d observations.
