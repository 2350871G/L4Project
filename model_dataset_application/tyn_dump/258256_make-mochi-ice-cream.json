The flavor, brand, or type of ice cream you use is entirely up to you and your preferences. Use a single flavor of ice cream, or use a different flavor for each mochi ball. You will need at least 2-3 cups (300-450 g) of ice cream to make 10 mochi balls, so purchase a standard \u00bd gallon (1,200 g) container of ice cream. Pick traditional vanilla or chocolate ice cream for a simple taste. Experiment with more complicated flavors like mint chocolate chip, rocky road, or cookie dough. Use strawberry, matcha, or black sesame ice cream for a savory taste that is more traditional to mochi ice cream sold in Japan."
