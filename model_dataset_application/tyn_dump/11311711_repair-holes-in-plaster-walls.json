Once the plaster hardens, it is difficult to scrape off without scratching the floor. Get a tarp or painting drop cloth online. They are available online or at most hardware stores along with all the other tools you will need to repair plaster. If you end up getting plaster on the floor, remove it as soon as possible. If it hardens, use a putty knife or scraper to remove it."

          "description":"Although plaster isn\u2019t particularly dangerous on its own, working with it creates a lot of dust. The stuff you mix could also end up getting into your eyes. As you protect yourself, warn other people in your home to stay out of the area until you are finished. Keep pets out as well. Open up doors and windows to help filter out the dust. Consider also using a strong vacuum to catch dust as it settles inside the room."

          "description":"Clear out the bits of plaster hanging around the hole\u2019s opening. Remove enough of it to create a flat, stable base for the new coat of plaster needed to cover the hole. The easiest way to do it is by lightly tapping the loose plaster with a hammer or paint scraper, then sanding the edges of the remaining plaster with 120-grit sandpaper. Make sure the existing plaster is flat and smooth so the new plaster adheres to it properly. Plaster walls generally include a wood surface called a lath. You will notice it as you look through the hole. Don\u2019t cut through this part. Remember to remove all the loose plaster inside the hole as well. It could get in the way of the new material you install. The plaster has to adhere to the wood lath in the wall in order to be sturdy. If it feels loose, replace it with new plaster or pin it down with plastic washers."

Note the dimensions of each hole you have to fix. For small holes from screws and nails, measuring isn\u2019t necessary. They don\u2019t require mesh for extra reinforcement. Instead, skip to filling in the holes with a lime-based plaster mix."

You may have to cut several pieces to cover up a particularly large hole. Hold the cut pieces up to the hole before installing them. Make sure they fit well so you have a base to cover with the plaster. For particularly large holes, consider using a metal mesh instead. Galvanized or aluminum plaster mesh rolls are much stronger and hold up better than fiberglass."

If you are unable to reach the lath, use plaster tape to secure the mesh directly over the hole. It won\u2019t affect the finish of the plaster as long as you spread enough of it to fill in the gaps and cover the mesh in a smooth layer. There are several ways to secure the mesh, such as by using nails or screws and plastic washers. Another option is to drill holes into the plaster and fill them with plaster adhesive. If the wood lath appears to be rotting or damaged, cut it out and replace it. If you notice a lot of damage, ask a professional to have a look at it to avoid causing serious damage to the wall."

Keep applying water until the wood and mesh are thoroughly dampened but not dripping. If you notice water dripping, stop spraying and blot the excess moisture with a towel. Plaster adheres better to damp surfaces. However, the moisture can cause the wood to rot if you\u2019re not careful. Mop up spills before attempting to seal the hole."

Combine equal parts water and plaster to create a quality mix that adheres well to the wall. Stir the plaster in the bucket until it\u2019s smooth and about as thick as peanut butter. For consistency, use a lime-based patching plaster. It doesn\u2019t set as quickly as other types of plaster, so it\u2019s easier to use.

Then, begin spreading more plaster across the mesh. Make this layer about \u20444 to \u20448 in (0.64 to 0.95 cm) or half as thick as the original plaster on the wall. The coating has to be only half as thick as normal in order to give you room to add additional layers. Applying additional coatings leads to a much stronger patch.

Hold a plastic paint scraper roughly parallel to the wall, then use it to lift off the plaster you wish to remove. Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for the proper drying time.

Take a step back and look at the patched area from afar to ensure it blends in well with the existing plaster. Sanding is useful if you plan on painting.

    "Stir a new batch of plaster in your bucket, then use the trowel to spread it over the original patch.",
    "Make this layer identical to the first one.",
    "It will also be \u20444 to \u20448 in (0.64 to 0.95 cm) thick.",
    "Spread plaster until the patch is flush with the rest of the wall.",
    "Try mixing the plaster so it\u2019s slightly softer than the original batch you made.",
    "If it\u2019s at the consistency of a buttercream frosting, it will be much easier to spread.",
    "Finish filling in small holes from screws and nails.",
    "Smooth out the second layer so it\u2019s flush with the wall and then use a joint compound if needed in order to finish the job.",
    "Wait another 4 hours for the plaster to dry.",
    "It\u2019s more waiting, but it\u2019s necessary for the plaster to set properly.",
    "In the meantime, make sure you have removed any plaster that has dripped outside of the patch.",
    "Use the trowel to scrape it off before it has a chance to harden.",
    "This layer doesn\u2019t have to be scored.",
    "Keep it flat and let it dry.",
    "The joint compound used for the final layer will adhere to it without issue.",
    "Cover the patch with a layer of ready-mix joint compound.",
    "The joint compound is already mixed, so all you have to do is put it on the wall.",
    "Use a trowel to spread it in a consistent layer across the hardened plaster.",
    "Make the layer about  \u20448 in (0.32 cm) thick.",
    "Check that it looks smooth and blends in with the rest of the wall.",
    "Joint compound is used as a finisher.",
    "It\u2019s very good for masking blemishes, including things like screws and drywall tape.",
    "Joint compound is very spreadable, so you could also use it to make patterns like swirls.",
    "Let the final coating dry for another 4 hours.",
    "Once the joint compound becomes dry to the touch, your wall will look as good as new.",
    "You may wish to add an extra layer of joint compound to complete the patch.",
    "It isn\u2019t necessary, but it can help if the patch doesn\u2019t blend in very well on the wall.",
    "Sand the plaster smooth using 120-grit sandpaper if necessary.",
    "If you took the time to smooth the joint compound out before it dried, you won\u2019t have to do a lot of sanding.",
    "However, fixing a rough finish isn\u2019t much of a challenge.",
    "Lightly wear away the rough parts of the plaster until the wall feels smooth and uniform to the touch.",
    "Take a step back and look at the patched area from afar to ensure it blends in well with the existing plaster.",
    "Sanding is useful if you plan on painting.",
    "It roughs up the plaster, which helps the paint bond with it.",
    "Sand with a very light touch to avoid leaving noticeable scratches.",
    "Wipe the wall clean with a cloth dampened in lukewarm water in order to remove the dust left behind after sanding.",
    "Clean up and paint the area if you desire.",
    "Once the plaster is repaired, use a paint roller to coat the wall in a latex drywall primer.",
    "Then, choose a latex wall paint to finish the job.",
    "When you\u2019re done, roll up the drop cloth and wash off the paint roller in a bucket of warm water.",
    "If you paint the wall, place painter\u2019s tape on baseboards and surrounding walls to guard against stains."
