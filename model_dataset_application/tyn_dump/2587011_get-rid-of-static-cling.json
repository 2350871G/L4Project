          "description":"After you\u2019ve washed and dried your clothes, grab a metal or wire clothing hanger. Before you put your clothes on, gently glide the metal hanger over your clothes. The metal discharges the electricity and removes the static. When you go to hang your clothing, hang clothing that is sticking and clinging with a metal hanger. You can also pass a metal hanger in between your skin and your clothes after putting the clothes on. This works particularly well with delicate fabrics, like silk. However, metal wire hangers can distort some clothing items, like heavy sweaters. If you think that your clothing may be damaged by a wire hanger, simply run the hanger over the surface of the fabric before storing your item some other way."

Turn your clothing out to face the right direction and put your clothing on. The safety pin will absorb any static electricity. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re removing your clothes from the dryer, closet, or dresser. The pin will still work to remove static cling. Avoid placing the pin on the front or near an exposed hem, since others will be able to see it if you do."

          "description":"Running a metal object across your clothing discharges the static electricity. After drying your clothes, put a metal thimble on your finger. Run the finger across the surface of every clothing item to reduce the static charge. You can use a metal-bristled brush instead of a thimble if you prefer, although this may not be the best choice if your fabric could snag on the bristles.Tip: If you don't want to walk around with a thimble on your thumb, you can tuck it away in your pocket and pull it out only as necessary. This may also help to reduce the amount of static building up in your clothes as you walk around. As with other tricks involving metal, the idea is to discharge the electrical charge to prevent static. Touching any metal object will accomplish the same goal if you do not have a metal thimble."

This will lightly cover the clothing in the hairspray without soaking it. Hairspray is specially formulated to combat static in your hair, but the same chemicals will prevent static cling from occurring on your clothes.Tip: The hairspray should be sprayed from a distance to prevent it from leaving visible traces on your clothing. For best results, focus your efforts on the areas of clothing that stick to you the most. Do this immediately before you wear your clothes so that the hairspray doesn\u2019t have time to wear off or dissipate. Hairspray won\u2019t normally stain your fabric, but it may leave a residue behind.

If you plan on machine drying your clothes, some of the charge may come back after the baking soda has been washed out. This method works best when used in conjunction with another way of removing static. You may not need to use another method if you air dry your clothes instead of machine-drying them, though. For smaller loads with less than 3\u20134 lb (1.4\u20131.8 kg) of clothing, feel free to decrease the amount of baking soda to \u20444  c (59 mL).

Restart the machine and allow it to continue its rinse cycle. Vinegar softens fabrics, preventing them from becoming too stiff and dry. This also helps to reduce the amount of static build-up. Do not use vinegar with bleach. These ingredients produce a noxious gas when they\u2019re combined. Do not use this method with the baking soda, although it\u2019s fine if you want to use tinfoil and fabric softener. If you don\u2019t want your clothes to smell like white vinegar, soak a washcloth in the vinegar instead and add that to the rinse cycle. The odor shouldn\u2019t be too overwhelming, even if you add the vinegar straight to the rinse water. If you have a softener dispenser in your machine, you can pour the vinegar inside at the start of the entire cycle. Adding vinegar to your clothing also results in brighter colors and cleaner whites. White vinegar works best, but in a pinch, you can use apple cider vinegar. You may not want to use apple cider vinegar on white or lightly-colored clothing, though."

The tinfoil discharges positive and negative charges that the washing machine produces.Warning: Only add your tinfoil to the washing machine. Do not add it to the dryer. If you dry the tinfoil, it could create a fire. Be sure to remove the tinfoil ball when moving your clothes from the washer to the dryer.

    "Stand 1\u20132 ft (0.30\u20130.61 m) away from your clothing and mist your clothing for 4-5 seconds.",
    "This will minimize the effect of static cling on your clothing.",
    "Do this right before you\u2019re going to put your clothes on for the best results.",
    "Most fabric softeners won\u2019t stain your clothing, especially when it is diluted with water.",
    "If you\u2019re worried about staining your clothes, turn the clothing inside-out before spritzing it.",
    "Stain removers and wrinkle removers will usually work just as well.",
    "Mist your dried clothes lightly with water.",
    "Fill an empty spray bottle with lukewarm tap water.",
    "Stand away from your clothing and spritz it 4-5 times while standing 1\u20132 ft (0.30\u20130.61 m).",
    "Spray enough water to mist your clothing without soaking it or making it damp.",
    "The water will neutralize the static charges that cause cling to occur.",
    "Do this right before you put your clothing item on for the best results.",
    "Adjusting the Wash Cycle Add \u20442  c (120 mL) of baking soda to your wash cycle.",
    "Baking soda will function the same way as fabric conditioner to absorb the electrical charges as your clothes wash. Before you start your wash cycle, pour \u20442  c (120 mL) of baking soda into the drum of the washer.",
    "Add your standard detergent and wash your clothes as you normally do.",
    "If you plan on machine drying your clothes, some of the charge may come back after the baking soda has been washed out.",
    "This method works best when used in conjunction with another way of removing static.",
    "You may not need to use another method if you air dry your clothes instead of machine-drying them, though.",
    "For smaller loads with less than 3\u20134 lb (1.4\u20131.8 kg) of clothing, feel free to decrease the amount of baking soda to \u20444  c (59 mL).",
    "Baking soda effectively creates a barrier around each garment, preventing negative and positive charges from building up and causing the garments to stick together.",
    "Baking soda has the added benefit of neutralizing odors.",
    "Sprinkle \u20442  c (120 mL) of white vinegar into your rinse cycle.",
    "After the washing machine completes its initial wash cycle, pause the machine and pour \u20442  c (120 mL) of distilled white vinegar over your clothes.",
    "Restart the machine and allow it to continue its rinse cycle.",
    "Vinegar softens fabrics, preventing them from becoming too stiff and dry.",
    "This also helps to reduce the amount of static build-up.",
    "Do not use vinegar with bleach.",
    "These ingredients produce a noxious gas when they\u2019re combined.",
    "Do not use this method with the baking soda, although it\u2019s fine if you want to use tinfoil and fabric softener.",
    "If you don\u2019t want your clothes to smell like white vinegar, soak a washcloth in the vinegar instead and add that to the rinse cycle.",
    "The odor shouldn\u2019t be too overwhelming, even if you add the vinegar straight to the rinse water.",
    "If you have a softener dispenser in your machine, you can pour the vinegar inside at the start of the entire cycle.",
    "Adding vinegar to your clothing also results in brighter colors and cleaner whites.",
    "White vinegar works best, but in a pinch, you can use apple cider vinegar.",
    "You may not want to use apple cider vinegar on white or lightly-colored clothing, though.",
    "Throw a ball of tinfoil into the washing machine with your clothes.",
    "Take a sheet of tinfoil and crumple it up into a small ball.",
    "Pack it tightly by squeezing it between both of your hands over and over.",
    "Add your ball of tinfoil to your washer and run your normal cycle.",
    "The tinfoil discharges positive and negative charges that the washing machine produces.Warning: Only add your tinfoil to the washing machine.",
    "Do not add it to the dryer.",
    "If you dry the tinfoil, it could create a fire.",
    "Be sure to remove the tinfoil ball when moving your clothes from the washer to the dryer.",
    "You can use tinfoil along with any other method, although you should avoid mixing baking soda and vinegar in your washing machine.",
    "Use fabric softener to prevent charges from building up.",
    "Liquid fabric softener helps prevent static from building up during the wash cycle.",
    "Add 2\u20133 teaspoons (9.9\u201314.8 mL) of liquid softener to your standard cycle per your softener\u2019s instructions.",
    "As wet clothes are tossed around in the washer, they build up an electrical charge that causes them to stick together.",
    "Fabric softeners contain chemicals designed to stop that electricity from building.",
    "Softener sheets work the same way as fabric softener.",
    "Get sheets if you want to avoid messy liquids.",
    "Softener sheets are typically added to the dryer, though.",
    "You can use fabric softener alongside any other method in this section.",
    "Drying Your Clothing Add a dryer ball to your dryer before adding your wet clothes.",
    "Dryer balls will work the exact same way as the sheets or fabric softener.",
    "They are designed to soften clothes without the use of chemicals.",
    "Add 1-2 dryer balls to your machine when you transfer your wet clothes to the dryer and run your dryer cycle as you normally do.",
    "Dryer balls also minimize the amount of contact fabrics have with one another in the machine.",
    "Electrical charges build up in fabric as one piece rubs up against another, so minimizing this contact also minimizes static.",
    "Add a damp washcloth to the last 10 minutes of the drying cycle.",
    "When your drying cycle has 10 minutes remaining, pause it.",
    "Switch the dryer to the lowest heat setting and throw a clean, damp washcloth into the machine.",
    "Turn the cycle back on and finish it.",
    "The water will absorb some of the electrical charges from the dryer and encourage clothes to remain soft and cling-free.",
    "This is essentially the same thing as misting your clothes with water after they dry.",
    "Shake your clothes when removing them from the dryer.",
    "As you remove each item of clothing from your dryer, give them 2-3 quick shakes.",
    "This prevents static from setting in as your clothes are placed on another surface.",
    "This only works if you take your clothes out immediately after they\u2019ve finished drying.",
    "Air dry your clothes to avoid static altogether.",
    "Instead of running your clothes through the machine, dry them by hanging them on a clothesline or closet rod.",
    "Take each item out of the machine after it has finished washing and hang it on the line or rod with a hanger or clothespins.",
    "Alternatively, you can run the dryer through half of a cycle to partially dry your clothes and then air dry them for the remainder of the time.",
    "A good portion of the electrical build-up responsible for static cling occurs when wet clothes are completely dried out using heat.",
    "Air drying prevents clothing from becoming extremely dry, which also prevents it from developing too much of an electrical charge.",
    "For an added layer of cling removal, hang your clothes on metal hangers to air dry them.",
    "Making Simple Daily Adjustments Moisturize your skin to keep clothes from sticking.",
    "Any kind of moisturizing lotion will work to remove static cling.",
    "Before putting your clothes on, rub moisturizer into your legs, torso, and arms.",
    "Work it into your skin until there are no visible globs of lotion remaining.",
    "Moisturizer will dispel static as your clothes absorb it from your skin.Tip: If you don\u2019t want to add a ton of lotion to your skin, rub a small amount on your hands and lightly run them around your body to add a small amount of moisture.",
    "By moisturizing your skin, you remove dryness that would otherwise attract a highly-charged fabric.",
    "You can rub lotion over your hands before removing laundry from the dryer or folding your clothes.",
    "This will prevent excess electrical charge from transferring from your hands to the fabric.",
    "Use a moisturizing conditioner to maintain your hairstyle.",
    "If static cling from your clothing is causing your hair to become frizzy, get a moisturizing conditioner or hair product.",
    "When you shower, rub the conditioner through your hair after shampooing.",
    "If you\u2019re using a moisturizing hair product, dry your hair and work the product through each section of your hair before styling it.",
    "Silicone-based conditioners will help keep static away from your hair more effectively, but there\u2019s a lot of debate over whether silicone is good for your hair or not.",
    "Moisturizing your hair will keep your hair from drying out.",
    "Dry hair is prone to attracting static electricity, which is what causes static cling.",
    "Swap your rubber-soled shoes out for a leather pair.",
    "Most shoes have rubber soles.",
    "This presents a problem with static though, since static charges can build up in rubber.",
    "If you find your clothes developing static cling throughout the day, swap your shoes out for a pair of leather-soled shoes.",
    "Wearing leather shoes will help you stay grounded since leather does not build up electrical charge as easily as rubber."
