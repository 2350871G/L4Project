Don\u2019t add too much butter to the pan, as the contents of the scrapple has enough grease. Too much butter will make the scrapple too oily when it has finished cooking.

Thin slices can cook in as quickly as 3 minutes, while thick slices may take up to 10 minutes on each side.

Scrapple is best served when it has been left to sit for a few minutes on the plate first.

Baking Scrapple in the Oven Preheat the oven to 415\u00b0F (213\u00b0C). A high temperature is the key to getting crispy, oven-baked scrapple. This will ensure that the scrapple is crispy on the outside and softer in the middle. Cover an oven tray with non-stick foil. Non-stick foil will make sure that the scrapple slices don\u2019t stick to the oven tray as they cook. You could also use baking paper if you don\u2019t have any non-stick foil on hand. If you prefer, you could also use a light coating of spray oil on the oven tray instead. Slice the 1/2 loaf of scrapple into \u00bc in (0.6 cm) thick slices. Use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to slice through the loaf. This should get you around 5 slices, depending on the size of the loaf. It is important to make the slices consistent in size, so that they all cook evenly in the oven. Place the scrapple slices on the oven tray. Spread out the slices, leaving a small gap surrounding each slice. Make sure the sides aren\u2019t touching, otherwise they may stick together as they bake. Leaving a gap in between each slice also lets the \u201ccrust\u201d of each slice form properly. Baking scrapple slices makes them less greasy than using a frying pan. Bake the scrapple for 15 minutes. Place the oven tray into the oven once it has preheated. Then set a timer for 15 minutes so that you can monitor the scrapple carefully.
