If a panel is coming away from the wall, nail it down in the groove. If you are reluctant to tear down the paneling, pay for a professional inspection.

Dirty walls may need a commercial degreaser to prepare the surface for paint, followed by a thorough water rinse. Degreasers can be dangerous to skin and lungs, so follow label instructions carefully. TSP (trisodium phosphate) is an effective choice, but it is banned in some areas for environmental reasons. If you want an environmentally friendly cleaner, you might try using a brand like Simple Green."

You can paint over the panels without filling, but the grooves will still be visible. If your panels are solid lumber (not plywood), prime the area with a joint compound (such as the kind you would use for drywall) before filling the grooves. If you don't, any filling you put in the grooves will eventually crack or fall out."

          "description":"Most paneling has a glossy finish, which needs to be roughened up for the primer. Scuff up the wood a little with a medium grit sandpaper, around 150 grit. Wipe away dust with a damp cloth. Always wear a dust mask while sanding. You can rub on a deglosser instead. This is faster, but you'll have to work one panel at a time, priming as soon as the deglosser dries to the correct consistency. Check product label for details. If you cleaned the panels with TSP, you might be able to skip this step. An additional light sanding or deglossing is still a good idea. If you do not sand away the finish, you should use an oil-based primer instead, as this will be easier for the paint to adhere to."

Let dry for 24 hours or the time recommended on the label. Some real lumber panels will bleed resin through the paint. Prevent this with a stain blocking primer. A tinted primer contributes to the final color."

Mix a standard drywall joint compound \"mud\" with a power mixer or hand tool. You can also buy a pre-mixed compound. Spread it over the grooves in a thin layer with a putty knife, then let dry overnight. If necessary \u2014 and it usually is \u2014 apply another thin coat or two, until the compound is flush with the panel surface. Let each coat dry overnight. After the final coat is dry, sand it down with a fine-grit sandpaper. If you have it handy, add a sprinkle of quick-setting joint compound when mixing your mud. This helps speed up the drying.
