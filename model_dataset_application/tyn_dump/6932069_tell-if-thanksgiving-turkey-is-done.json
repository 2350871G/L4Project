  "text":" Using a Thermometer Locate the turkey's thigh. To find the thighs, look for the drumsticks. The thigh will be directly below the drumstick and next to the breast on both sides of the turkey. The thighs are dark meat, which take longer to cook than white meat, such as the breasts. Insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh. You can use a standard or instant-read meat thermometer to determine the turkey's internal temperature. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh that's directly below the leg.Did You Know? Pop-up thermometers that are included in some turkeys are often inaccurate or they only pop up once the turkey has reached 178 \u00b0F (81 \u00b0C). Ensure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone, which could give your thermometer a false reading. Check to see if the turkey has reached 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C).

Estimating Without a Thermometer Find the thighs on the turkey. If you don't have a thermometer, you'll need to determine if the turkey is done based on the part of the turkey that takes the longest to cook. Look directly below the drumsticks and next to the breasts to find the turkey's thighs. Since thigh meat is muscular and dark, it takes the longest time to cook. Insert the tip of a knife or a skewer into the thigh. Poke the knife or skewer into the crease between the thigh and the breast. This will probably be covered with skin that you'll have to cut through. You don't need to cut very deep into the thigh. Cut about 2 inches (5.1 cm) or until you see the juices start to run out. Look for clear juices. Once you've inserted the knife or skewer into the thigh, you should see juices run out. If the juices are clear, the turkey has finished cooking. If you see blood or slightly red juices, the turkey isn't done.Tip: If the turkey hasn't finished cooking, return it to the oven and check it again in 20 minutes. Rest the turkey for 45 minutes once the juices run clear. Turn off the oven and take the roasting pan out of the oven.
