You also can draw them back to let in the light and open up the view. Plus, once you hang the curtain rod, it's easy to change curtains to switch up your decor! Start by measuring the window's width (for the curtain rod) and height (for the curtain length). Use a drill and screwdriver to attach the curtain rod brackets to the window frame or wall. Use a spirit level to make sure the rod will be level. Slide the curtains onto the rod, then place the rod on the brackets."

Drape your chosen selection of fabrics over the string\u2014try bandanas, scarves, fabric scraps, and so on. For a valance, use strips of fabric that are about 20\u201325 in (51\u201364 cm) long. This means they'll hang over the window about 1 ft (30 cm) when you drape them. For curtains, choose pieces of fabric that are about twice as long as the height of the window.

Blinds can be installed inside or outside the window frame, and can be paired with curtains or installed on their own. Begin by measuring the width and height of your window so you can purchase the proper size for your blinds. Install the brackets that will hold up the blinds with a drill and screwdriver, and check for level with a spirit level.

Like curtains, they're usually made of fabric and offer softness, warmth, and color and style variety. There are many types of shades to choose from, including basic roll-up shades, honeycomb shades, and Roman shades, among others. Generally speaking, the process for hanging shades is the same as for hanging blinds. You'll measure for size, attach the brackets, clip the shades into the brackets, and apply any accessories as needed. Like blinds, shades can be installed either inside or outside the window frame. If they're installed inside the frame, you can easily pair them with curtains, if desired."

When they're closed over the window, though, you can also adjust the shutter slats in order to control the light infiltration and visibility. Typically, you'll use a drill and screwdriver to attach hinges to the window frame, then attach the shutters to the hinges. Make sure you measure beforehand so you buy the right size, and check frequently with a spirit level so you hang the shutters evenly. You can find plantation shutters at many home improvement stores. If you're wary of installing them yourself, the store may be able to send an installer or help you find one."

Peel away 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) of the adhesive backing at the start of the roll, and stick it to the glass at the top of the pane, overlapping the top by 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm). Steadily unroll the film, peel away the backing, and smooth the film onto the glass. Overlap the bottom by 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm), then cut the film with scissors or a crafting knife. After sticking the film on the glass, use a hair dryer to blow warm air over the film for 3-5 minutes. This will shrink the film, smooth out wrinkles, and increase its adherence to the window. Once you've shrunk the film, use a crafting knife to trim excess film around the edges of the window glass. Insulation film doesn't block the view in or out of the window, but it does add a layer of insulation to the glass."

Run the double-sided adhesive strip that comes with the kit around the entire perimeter of the window frame. Unfold or unroll the plastic sheet and stick it to the perimeter tape. Start at a top corner, and pull the plastic taut as you work your way around the window. Use a hair dryer to warm the plastic sheeting for 3-5 minutes. This will shrink it slightly and smooth out any wrinkles. After that, use a crafting knife to trim excess sheeting from around the adhesive strip."

If the bubble wrap won't stick in place this way, apply several strips of double-sided tape around the perimeter of the glass.

It's really easy to take off (you just peel it away), but it's worth taking your time installing it to get the right fit and look. Start by measuring the dimensions of the window glass carefully, transferring these measurements to the film, and cutting it precisely with a crafting knife or scissors. Clean the window with a lint-free cloth and a 1:1 mix of water and white vinegar. Then, mist the window lightly with a spray bottle filled with plain water.

Don't worry, though\u2014it's easy to remove from glass with a razor scraper, should you change your mind! To begin, clean the window with a lint-free cloth and a 1:1 mix of water and white vinegar, then let it dry. Use painter's tape to cover the window frame and other nearby non-glass surfaces\u2014this is much easier than trying to scrape the coating off of the non-glass surfaces afterward! Shake the can as directed, then apply a thin, even coat by spraying in short bursts while moving your hand up and down and side to side.

Or, check antique stores and flea markets for an authentic stained glass panel. Either place the panel on the window ledge and lean it against the window pane, or use screw-in hooks to hang it from the underside of the top of the window frame. Faux stained glass is just painted glass, while true stained glass contains individual pieces of shaped and colored glass. You can also make your own faux stained glass.

Depending on the type of window, you can line up potted plants on the windowsill, on a table, counter, or hutch under the window, or on the floor in front of the window. Use the size of the window and the amount of sunlight that comes through it to determine which plant or plants to put in front of it.

You won't fully block the view, but you will obscure it. Start by measuring your window's width and buying (or cutting) one or more shelves that are about 4 in (10 cm) wider.

    "It's really easy to take off (you just peel it away), but it's worth taking your time installing it to get the right fit and look.",
    "Start by measuring the dimensions of the window glass carefully, transferring these measurements to the film, and cutting it precisely with a crafting knife or scissors.",
    "Clean the window with a lint-free cloth and a 1:1 mix of water and white vinegar.",
    "Then, mist the window lightly with a spray bottle filled with plain water.",
    "Peel the backing off the film, then carefully apply the film to the window, using a squeegee or a credit card to smooth out any air bubbles as you work.",
    "Spray a frosted coating onto the glass for another easy-on/off option.",
    "A frosted coating provides a look that's similar to privacy film, but you spray it on like spray paint.",
    "Don't worry, though\u2014it's easy to remove from glass with a razor scraper, should you change your mind!",
    "To begin, clean the window with a lint-free cloth and a 1:1 mix of water and white vinegar, then let it dry.",
    "Use painter's tape to cover the window frame and other nearby non-glass surfaces\u2014this is much easier than trying to scrape the coating off of the non-glass surfaces afterward!",
    "Shake the can as directed, then apply a thin, even coat by spraying in short bursts while moving your hand up and down and side to side.",
    "Let it dry as directed, then decide if you'd like to add one or more additional coats for greater concealment.",
    "Put a stained glass panel in front of the window for colorful concealment.",
    "Head to a hobby or craft store and buy a pre-made, faux stained glass panel that's slightly smaller than your window.",
    "Or, check antique stores and flea markets for an authentic stained glass panel.",
    "Either place the panel on the window ledge and lean it against the window pane, or use screw-in hooks to hang it from the underside of the top of the window frame.",
    "Faux stained glass is just painted glass, while true stained glass contains individual pieces of shaped and colored glass.",
    "You can also make your own faux stained glass.",
    "Buy a framed window pane and use stencils and glass paint to decorate it.",
    "Check your local craft store for supplies.",
    "Use potted plants to obscure the window view with living color.",
    "You might not think of plants as a window covering, but they can do a good job of blocking the view while still letting in light.",
    "Depending on the type of window, you can line up potted plants on the windowsill, on a table, counter, or hutch under the window, or on the floor in front of the window.",
    "Use the size of the window and the amount of sunlight that comes through it to determine which plant or plants to put in front of it.",
    "Talk to a knowledgeable staff member at a garden center for advice.",
    "Mount shelves across the front of the window for partial coverage.",
    "Once you've attached the shelves, you can fill them with small potted plants, books, colorful glass bottles, framed photos, knick-knacks, or whatever else you like.",
    "You won't fully block the view, but you will obscure it.",
    "Start by measuring your window's width and buying (or cutting) one or more shelves that are about 4 in (10 cm) wider.",
    "Mark the locations for your shelf brackets on the outside of the window frame, then use a drill and screwdriver to install the brackets.",
    "Use a spirit level to ensure that everything stays level.",
    "Lay the shelf on the brackets, then start filling it with whatever you like!",
    "Covering a Broken Window Apply transparent tape over both sides of any cracks in the glass.",
    "If the window is cracked but not completely shattered, use strips of clear tape to help prevent it from cracking further.",
    "Apply the tape to both the interior and exterior sides of the glass, if possible.",
    "However, if this isn't practical, just tape the inside.",
    "Work very carefully around cracked glass.",
    "It can easily shatter into dangerous shards in its weakened state.",
    "If the window glass is completely broken, put on thick gloves and work cautiously to remove and clean up the broken glass.",
    "Cut thick plastic to fit over the entire window pane.",
    "Measure the length and width of the broken window, from the center of the frame on the top, bottom, and both sides.",
    "Transfer the measurements to thick plastic\u2014for instance, a contractor-grade trash bag\u2014and cut the plastic to size.",
    "Don't use thin plastic like a kitchen trash bag.",
    "You can use a thicker, waterproof material like a tarp.",
    "Staple or tape the plastic to the window frame to cover the broken glass.",
    "If the window frame is made of wood, use a staple gun to tack the plastic into place.",
    "Start at one corner and pull the plastic taut as you go, adding staples approximately every 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm).",
    "If your window frame is made out something other than wood, such as vinyl, use packing tape or duct tape to secure the plastic.",
    "Use the covering only as a temporary measure.",
    "No matter how well you secure it in place, the plastic covering will eventually fail and let water and outside air in.",
    "Aim to replace the broken window within 1-2 days, if possible.",
    "If you aren't confident in your ability to replace the window yourself, search for \u201cglass repair\u201d or \u201cwindow repair\u201d companies in your area."
