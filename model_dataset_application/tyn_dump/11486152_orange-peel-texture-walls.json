          "description":"To create an orange peel texture, you\u2019ll need a spray hopper and air compressor. A hopper is essentially a pressurized spray gun with a storage compartment on top of it. The compressor hooks up to the hopper and pushes your wall texture out of the nozzle. Buy or rent a hopper and compressor from your local construction supply store. The hopper will cost roughly $50-300 per day to rent, while the air compressor will cost $50-150 a day.Tip: Unless you\u2019re planning on reusing the hopper and compressor, you\u2019re better off renting your hardware. These items can be kind of expensive. A decent hopper will cost $500-2500, while an air compressor will cost $100-400. This process does not involve the use of any toxic chemicals. You don\u2019t need to worry about wearing gloves or a respirator."

          "description":"Applying an orange peel texture is an incredibly messy process since it can only be sprayed on. To keep your floors safe and make cleaning up easier, lay down drop cloths or plastic sheeting across the entirety of the floor in the room that you\u2019re working. If you do accidentally get some joint compound on your floor, you\u2019ll have 15-30 minutes to wipe it up with a clean rag or damp sponge. This isn\u2019t a big deal, but if the compound is all over the place this can be a nightmare. Ideally, you\u2019re applying the texture before you\u2019ve installed baseboards. If you already have your baseboards installed though, tape your plastic sheeting to the top of the baseboard with painter\u2019s tape. Drop cloths are typically too heavy to tape."

For windows, lay a sheet of plastic over the window and use painter\u2019s tape to stick it to the frame. Cover any surfaces that you don\u2019t want to texture with painter\u2019s tape. Orange peel is almost always applied before a room is finished. If your room is finished though, use a screwdriver to remove the faceplates out of the outlets. Uninstall any glass fixtures, like lights, by unscrewing them from the mounting plate. If the fixture can\u2019t be removed, you can cover it with a plastic bag or painter\u2019s tape. If you have a ceiling fan, unscrew the blades near the motor and set them aside. Then, wrap the fan in a plastic bag and tape it near the top of the mounting bracket."

Twist the smallest nozzle on to the spray gun by turning it clockwise into the threading. Continue turning the nozzle until it won\u2019t move any further. Orange peel texture requires a fine mist to settle correctly. This means that you need a thin nozzle setting to get the right consistency. If you have a newer hopper with an adjustable nozzle, twist it until the opening is as small as possible."

You\u2019re going to mix the compound with water in the bucket, so if you overfill the container you may end up spilling. Any type of mudding compound will work for this. Fast-drying joint compound will make this process harder though since you\u2019ll have less time to work with it before the joint compound hardens. To keep it easier to work with, select a joint compound with a 24-48 hour drying time. Do this outside or on top of your drop cloth or plastic sheet."

    "The thicker the compound is, the more water that you need to add.",
    "Stop mixing once your compound looks soupy and thin.",
    "The amount of water that you need to use is different based on the material and thickness of the compound.",
    "Regardless of the type of compound, stop adding water once your compound thins out.",
    "It should resemble soup by the time that you\u2019re done mixing water in and should be only slightly thicker than water.",
    "Most professionals don\u2019t use a recipe or predetermined amount of water when mixing a texture.",
    "They simply stop once the compound has a thin, soupy consistency.",
    "Hook your air hose up to the compressor and hopper.",
    "Take your air hose and twist it into the air compressor\u2019s spigot.",
    "Take the other end and twist it into your hopper\u2019s spigot at the bottom of the spray gun.",
    "If you have a larger hopper with a separate spray gun, attach a second hose from the spray gun to the container.",
    "Some hoppers are stationary and have built-in compressors.",
    "Some hoppers are attached to the top of the spray gun.",
    "Larger hoppers have a separate spray gun that have to be attached.",
    "Pour your mixed compound into the top of the hopper.",
    "Flip the lid for your hopper open.",
    "Lift the bucket filled with water and joint compound up to the hopper and carefully pour it into the top.",
    "Fill the top of the hopper up to the fill line as indicated by the hash mark on the inside of the container.",
    "Some hoppers don\u2019t have a fill line.",
    "Fill these hoppers up till they\u2019re 2/3 full.",
    "Turn the dial on your air compressor to 60-80 psi.",
    "To push the joint compound through the nozzle of your spray gun, you\u2019ll need a fair amount of pressure.",
    "Before you turn the compressor on, turn the dial on the front of the compressor to 60-80 psi.",
    "You can always change the psi after you\u2019ve started the compressor, so start at 60 psi and work up from there.",
    "Plug your compressor into an outlet if it\u2019s not battery operated and flip the power switch to turn it on.",
    "Psi stands for pressure per square inch.",
    "Applying the Texture Hold your spray gun 18\u201324 in (46\u201361 cm) away from the wall.",
    "Choose a section at the top of a wall to start at.",
    "Lift the hopper\u2019s spray gun up with both hands and steady it.",
    "Hold the gun 18\u201324 in (46\u201361 cm) away from the wall to ensure that you aren\u2019t concentrating the spray in any single area.",
    "Work from the top down, and left to right from your starting point.Tip: If you want to get a feel for the process, practice on a spare sheet of drywall.",
    "It isn\u2019t a particularly difficult process though, so you should get the hang of it pretty quickly.",
    "Put your nondominant hand on top of the gun and hold it up near your face to protect your face from any compound.",
    "You can wear protective eyewear if you\u2019d like, but this is a pretty safe process.",
    "You shouldn\u2019t experience any leaks if you\u2019ve hooked your hoses up tightly.",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter where you start.",
    "You\u2019ll work your way around the entire room and different walls don\u2019t require different techniques.",
    "Pull the trigger and spray back-and-forth in a 3 ft (0.91 m) section.",
    "To initiate the spray, pull the trigger to release the air and compound.",
    "Move the gun back and for the across a small 2\u20134 ft (0.61\u20131.22 m) section of the wall for 10-15 seconds.",
    "Since joint compound is roughly the same color as unpainted drywall, you may not see it covering the wall at first.",
    "Continue applying the texture until the section is a solid, uniform color.",
    "Don\u2019t hold the spray gun in any one location for more than 1-2 seconds.",
    "Keep moving the gun to ensure that your texture comes out evenly.",
    "If you notice your compound is ricocheting off of the wall, back up a little.",
    "Move the spray gun down the wall while continuing to move it.",
    "Keep the trigger held down.",
    "Once you\u2019ve covered one section of your wall, move the sprayer down to the next 3 ft (0.91 m) section.",
    "Move the spray back and forth across the surface to apply your joint compound evenly.",
    "Repeat this process until you\u2019ve reached the floor.",
    "Spray each section of your wall for 10-15 seconds to completely apply the texture.",
    "Repeat this process until you\u2019ve covered your entire room.",
    "Continue spraying your walls using the same method.",
    "Start at the top and work your way down to avoid drips.",
    "Work in 3 ft (0.91 m) lengths until you\u2019ve completely covered all of your walls.",
    "You can use a damp sponge to wipe up any compound that you get on the ceiling, trim, or floors.",
    "Wait at least 48 hours for your texture to dry.",
    "Once you\u2019ve covered your walls, give the joint compound time to dry.",
    "Take your painter\u2019s tape off, remove any plastic from your windows, and crack them open 2\u20136 inches (5.1\u201315.2 cm) to give the room some ventilation.",
    "Wait at least 48 hours before painting or patching your texture.",
    "You can repeat this process to fill in any sections that you missed.",
    "You can apply wet orange peel texture to dry compound at any time.",
    "Just make sure that you let the wet compound dry for twice as long since the compound underneath it may get wet again."
