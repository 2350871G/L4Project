Experiment with your vacuum\u2019s suctions settings to see which one gets the best results for your carpet type. Most vacuums have adjustments for low, medium, and high pile carpets."

This will remove some of the weight burden from the carpet. Repeated foot traffic can also cause low-grade dents, so try to lay rugs in areas where people will be walking back and forth repeatedly. For example, if you have a carpeted hallway, a rug can minimize the wear to the center part of the carpet. If you place rugs under furniture, they may become dented over time.
