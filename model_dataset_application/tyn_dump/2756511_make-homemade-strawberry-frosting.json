From time to time, pause the blender/food processor, and scrape any large clumps down towards the bottom with a rubber spatula.

Bring the strawberry pur\u00e9e to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low. Let the pur\u00e9e simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it thickens. You will end up with about 3 to 4 tablespoons (50 to 60 milliliters) of strawberry pur\u00e9e. Chill the strawberry pur\u00e9e, then set aside 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) for your frosting. Pour the strawberry pur\u00e9e into a bowl, and let it reach room temperature before chilling it in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Once the pur\u00e9e has chilled, measure out 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters). If you have any left over, you can store them in the fridge in a small bottle or jar. Cream the butter and cream cheese together until smooth, about 30 seconds. You can do this in a bowl using a handheld mixer. You can also use a stand mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks. Beat in the powdered sugar, \u00bd cup (65 grams) at a time. You will end up using 3 to 4 cups (375 to 400 grams) of powdered sugar. The more sugar you add, the stiffer your frosting will be. Add the salt, then beat until the frosting is light and fluffy. This will take about 3 to 5 minutes. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, especially if you are using a handheld mixer. Add in the strawberry pur\u00e9e and vanilla extract, and beat again until evenly combined. Vanilla extract can change the color of frosting. If this is an issue for you, use clear vanilla extract instead. Use the frosting right away, or refrigerate it. If the frosting is too soft for you, cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap, and stick it in the fridge until it reaches the consistency you need. Check on it every 15 minutes. Store any unused frosting in the fridge, covered, for up to 1 week. Let it sit at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before you use it. Making Strawberry Whipped Cream Frosting Start with cold mixing equipment. Place your bowl and whisk in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes. If you are using a stand mixer or a food processor, see if you can detach the bowl, and put it into the freezer. If you can't, then don't worry about it. Working with cold equipment prevents the whipped cream from getting too soft. Beat the cold, heavy whipping cream, vanilla extract, and granulated white sugar until soft peaks form. Place everything, except for the strawberry pur\u00e9e/jam into the bowl of your mixer. Beat the ingredients together until they get soft peaks. Add \u2153 cup (80 milliliters) of chilled strawberry pur\u00e9e or strawberry jam. You can use something that you bought from the store, or you can make your own. Beat everything together until stiff peaks form. You want the color and texture to be even and consistent. If you are using a handheld mixer, be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.
