Pumps can be purchased from most home improvement or landscape supply stores. You will need a pump with enough power (measured in gallons per second) to push the water up to the fountainhead.

The pipes or tubing will deliver the water from the reservoir to the fountainhead. Many water pumps will come with tubing, but if not, or if you need something specific for your design (such as copper pipe), you will need to purchase it separately.
