If you'd rather skip the initial germination phase, larger cuttings can be taken from the tips or cane (the long, woody stalk from which the leaves sprout). Both forms will flourish equally well so long as they are properly cared for. Look for Dracaena specimens at your local greenhouse or plant nursery. Soaking the seeds in fresh water for 3-5 days before planting them will aid in germination. It's also possible to transplant young plants whole from one pot or garden plot to another."

This will help keep the roots bound, allowing the plant to grow larger, healthier, and at a faster rate. Whatever pot you go with should have holes at the bottom to facilitate drainage. It may be necessary to move your plant outdoors or trim it down to more manageable proportions once it starts nearing its full size."

If you're potting a whole plant, press the root ball into the depression you made at a slight angle and pile the soil up around the canes to anchor them. If you're working with seeds or smaller cuttings, simply cover them with a thin layer of soil. Dracaena Marginata can get pretty big, so limit one plant per pot. Gently separate the ends of the roots with your fingers to prevent them from clustering together. When starting from seeds, it typically takes 30-40 days for the plant to sprout. The basic planting procedure will be the same whether you choose to grow the plant inside or outside."

Place the pot beneath a window sill or in a shaded spot outdoors where it can get plenty of exposure while staying out of the most intense rays. Since it adapts so well to variations in light and temperature, so there will be no need to move the plant once you've found a good spot for it. Dragon Tree is also capable of surviving in low light, such as the interior of the home, though this may result in thin, lightly-colored leaves.

Temperatures between 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C) are generally best, with an ideal humidity of 30-40%. Luckily, this will be right around the average humidity of most homes. Though Dracaena is a hearty species that can survive low temperatures, it's recommended that you bring outdoor plants inside during the cold winter months to keep them healthy. If you live in an area with a particularly dry climate, you can promote the reabsorption of moisture by scattering a thin layer of pebbles over the bottom of the pot before adding the soil."
