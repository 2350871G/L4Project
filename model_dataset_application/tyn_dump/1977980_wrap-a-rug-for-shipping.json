To achieve the same effect with a cotton sheet, spread a polyurethane wrap over the cotton, taping it tightly at the ends of the sheet. Secure the paper or sheet with cotton or polyester twill tape, which you can find at craft stores. Leave an additional 2 feet (0.61 m) of paper or sheet along the width of the rug. If you use polyurethane on sheet, wash the sheet well before using again. Avoid using plastic to roll your rug. Plastic prevents the rug from breathing and can attract moths or other small insects that can damage your carpet."

Subtract your own weight from it to get the weight of the rug by itself. For example, if you and the rug together weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), but you only weigh 135 pounds (61 kg), then the rug weighs 15 pounds (6.8 kg). You can also roughly estimate your rug\u2019s weight by calculating \u00be pound per square foot (340 grams per .09 square meters).
