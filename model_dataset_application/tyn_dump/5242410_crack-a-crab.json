However, there is very juicy and sweet meat in these legs that you can use for soups or crab cakes. To begin, take the hinged seafood cracker and hit the claws with a crab mallet, or use your knife. The easiest way to open a claw:\nTake your knife and lay it with the sharp side down on the middle of the red side of the claw. Use the crab mallet to gently hit the knife until it is halfway through the claw. Lastly, swivel the knife to the side. The claw will open and make it much easier to grab the crabmeat. Once you have snapped the shell open, eat the meat. Make sure you avoid the cartilage."
