          "description":"If you don't have bubblegum you can't make a bubble. You can buy gum at pretty much every corner store. Chewing gums can be used to make bubbles, but they won't be as big, and they'll usually pop too easily. To start off, select a pack of bubblegum like Double Bubble or Bazooka. Generally, if there is a picture of a bubble on the package, it's a good choice. Some gums are also stickier, making them harder to remove from your face when they pop. Usually, if you chew these gums a little longer before blowing a bubble, they won't be quite as sticky. Gums with less sugar often have a stronger gum base for making bubbles. Gum bases contain a long molecule that adds elasticity to the gum. The right amount will make for the best texture for bubbles. Avoid old gum. If your gum is stale it will be more dry, harder to chew, and bad for making bubbles. Use fresh gum to get the best results."

Use your tongue to flatten the ball into a small, flat circle. Use the back of your teeth to help flatten it by pushing the ball into them."

You'll need to be very gentle or you might poke your tongue right through. If that does happen, just form the ball again and start over. Keep practicing as this step can be difficult. Practice in front of a mirror so you can see when the tip of the gum is in the right position."

          "description":"Blow gently until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and start to push the gum out of your mouth in a bubble shape. Many people make the mistake of blowing just out of their lips rather than using breath from deeper within. Lip breath is not strong enough to produce a proper bubble so be sure to put more energy into it. The appropriate way to push air into the gum is like producing a heavy sigh. Use your diaphragm to push the air and exhale."

Keep blowing, slow and steady, as you gradually expand the gum. Keep your mouth open. Resist the urge to close your lips after removing your tongue. Keeping your mouth in an open position will give you a larger area to push air through."
