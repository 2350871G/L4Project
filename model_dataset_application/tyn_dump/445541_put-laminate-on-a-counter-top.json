Here are some things you will need to know before beginning:\nDecide how large the counter top or work top will be. For example, a work-counter in a craft room may need to be 24\u201336 inches (61.0\u201391.4 cm) wide, depending on the size of the materials you will use on it. Look at the colors and the effect they will have on the surface. Dark wood or stone designs are pretty to look at, but if the lighting in the area you will use them in is not sufficient, a lighter or brighter color may be more suitable. Look at the exposure the surface can expect. For areas near sinks or where water or other liquids may be spilled, post-formed counter tops will help manage spills since they have an integrated back-splash and slightly raised front edge to decrease run-off from the surface."

      "description":"Plywood or MDF (medium density fiberboard) are common materials for a laminate substrate, and each has advantages and disadvantages. Here is a limited comparison:\nPlywood has a somewhat higher structural strength, and weighs less than its fiberboard counterpart. It can be purchased in thicknesses ranging from \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) to \u20444 inch (1.9 cm), and comes in sheets normally sized at 4 foot (1.2 m) by 8 foot (2.4 m), although special order sheets can be longer. Plywood with exterior glue will be somewhat more resistant to moisture, as well. MDF board is less inclined to warping, since it has no directional grain. Its surface is more dense, so it takes the glue a bit better than plywood, and the glue will not dry quite as quickly. Typically, MDF board is about 25-30% less expensive than a sanded hardwood plywood."
