    "That\u2019s why it\u2019s so convenient to have it growing indoors!",
    "You can put snipped cilantro stems in a cup of water for a few hours, if necessary, but the flavor will suffer.",
    "Cilantro does not store well either refrigerated or frozen.",
    "Snip off flowers immediately to encourage leaf growth.",
    "Every time a flower appears on your cilantro plant, it diverts energy away from leaf production.",
    "It also moves the plant one step closer to \u201cbolting\u201d (or \u201cgoing to seed\u201d), after which it won\u2019t be useful in recipes.",
    "Just snip the new flowers off with scissors, or pinch them off with your fingers.",
    "This will slow down the bolting process, but it\u2019s impossible to stop it from taking over eventually.",
    "Plant the seeds of \"bolted\" cilantro to propagate the herb.",
    "Once the flowers start cropping up all over and the leaves stop appearing, you may choose to just pull up the plant and start over with new seeds or seedlings.",
    "However, you can also encourage the plant to self-propagate if you wish.",
    "Eventually, the flowers will drop seeds into the surrounding potting mix, and you can watch to see if new seedlings emerge.",
    "If you want to facilitate the process, pluck some of the seeds from the seed heads within the flower blooms.",
    "You can plant these in the same pot (and remove the old plant), or start them in a new pot."
