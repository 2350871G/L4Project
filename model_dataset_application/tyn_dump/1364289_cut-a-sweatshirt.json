You can cut the sweatshirt as high or as low as you want it to be. You can hold the sweatshirt up to your body to identify where you want the new bottom of it to be. Then, make a few marks across the sweatshirt to indicate where you want to cut it. Use your ruler to connect the marks into a line after you lay it down again. Trying the sweatshirt on and marking it while you are wearing it is the best option if you want a very specific length."
