  "text":" Prepare the pancake batter by following the directions on the box. Or the ingredient list in How to Make Pancakes if you are making your own pancakes. Divide the pancake batter (depending on how many you wish to make) into 6 small bowls.  Color the pancake batters using the food coloring. Red: In bowl 1, drop in 4 drops of red food coloring and mix well. Yellow: In bowl 2, drop in 3 drops of yellow food coloring and mix well. Orange: In bowl 3, drop in 5 drops of red and 5 drops of yellow food coloring and mix well. Green: In bowl 4, drop in 4 drops of green food coloring and mix well. Blue: In bowl 5, drop in 4 drops of blue food coloring and mix well. Purple: In bowl 6, drop in 5 drops of blue and 5 drops of red food coloring and mix well. Preheat a griddle on medium-low heat.  Spray cooking spray on the pan to prevent the pancakes from sticking. Keeping the heat medium-low prevents the pancakes from cooking too fast and keeps them from turning brown. Remember, you want rainbow pancakes, not brown! Pour a cup full of batter into the griddle or frying pan and cook until ready to flip. You should see lots of bubbles on the top and be able to handle the bottom of the pancake without batter flowing everywhere into the pan. That is how you know when to flip. Cook on the other side for about 1 minute and place on a plate.  Continue with the other colour batters until you have all of the pancakes cooked.  Stack your pancakes however you like. Serve and enjoy!",
