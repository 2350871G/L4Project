The time spent in an art studio with an art teacher can help you find mistakes and fix them far faster than you could on your own. However, you do not need to go to classes, you can find many different classes online. So if you like to draw in the comfort of your own home, online can be cheap, expensive, or even free.

The best artists and art teachers pour over books, real-life examples, and studies to understand the lines they are making. While this depends on the type of drawing you are working on. All artists can benefit from time away from the sketchbook every now and then. If you are drawing people, invest in an illustrated book of human anatomy, or sign-up for drawing classes with a live model. If you are drawing animals, spend a day with your sketchbook at the zoo or purchase an illustrated textbook on animal anatomy. If you are drawing landscapes or city scenes, you should invest in a book about perspective to help you accurately create depth in your drawings."

As such, they can be useful when trying to draw complex poses. Simply put the doll into the right position and use it to sketch out your drawing, adding the details of your character later. If you cannot get a model, use a skeleton from your school\u2019s biology department to learn proportions. They also make anatomically correct models of hands, heads, and the skeletal system as well, though they are often more expensive.

          "headline":"Give yourself guide lines.",
          "description":"This is often overlooked by beginning artists who dive right into the work, but it is incredibly important to get accurate drawings. For example, if you are drawing a large scene, start with faint lines that break your drawing up into thirds both horizontally and vertically. You should have nine small boxes on your page. These will help you to frame your drawing and put everything where it should be, giving you reference points as you work."

          "description":"Proportion is the difference in size between two objects. If you draw your arms and legs out of proportion, for example, your drawing will look crude and lopsided. Close one eye and line your pencil up with the subject. Your arm should be completely extended. Use your pencil as a ruler and mark the length of the object with your thumb. You can then compare this distance with other objects on your page, or even use your pencil to mark out the specific distance on the page for your drawing. You can also use your guidelines to help. What \u201cbox\u201d of your guidelines does the subject fit into? Do they take up the whole page, or a third of it?"

        {
          "headline":"Sketch out the basics of each drawing before moving on.",
          "description":"There is no worse feeling than getting halfway done with a drawing and realizing that the arm of your character is much too short. Good drawers know how to avoid this by blocking out the drawing beforehand. Use simple shapes to mark the proportions of each object. For example, make an oval for a person\u2019s head, a rounded rectangle for the torso, and longer elbows for each arm and leg. Keep adjusting these blocks until you feel confident in the pose and proportions of each item. Make sure you make these marks lightly, so that you can easily erase them later. Make a small circle or dot for each joint to help you \u201cmove\u201d arms and legs into accurate poses."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Slowly add in the details to your contours.",
          "description":"Add a layer of complexity with each draft. First it is guidelines and stick figures. Then you add in basic shapes and poses. Next, add in permanent lines over your outline, connecting the joints, adding facial features, etc. Think about making the final contour of the body by connecting the joints so that you have a recognizable shape. Once you\u2019re happy with your new lines, erase away your light contour marks from underneath the new drawing. Work slowly, making each line carefully and erasing when you are unhappy. You need your contour to be accurate in order for the final drawing to improve."

          "headline":"Draw from the largest object down to the smallest.",
          "description":"Never start a drawing at the details. Once you\u2019ve finished you basic contours, it\u2019s time to move on to the details. This is where most artists get caught up early on, spending all of their time and energy on the small details while neglecting the larger proportions."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Practice perspective to give scenes realistic depth.",
          "description":"Perspective is why far away objects appear small and nearby ones appear large. To get accurate drawings, you need to have accurate perspective. One way to practice is to use a perspective point. Think of this as the farthest point on the horizon, like the sun right before it sets. Draw straight lines out from this point to match your drawings \u2013 anything closer to the dot is farther away, and thus smaller, and anything away from the dot is close to you. Draw two diagonal lines coming away from the dot. Anything that fits between those two lines is the same size in real life, though perspective makes it appear as if they are different."

          "description":"Shading is what makes a drawing pop and prevents it from feeling flat. A big part of the illusion of three-dimensions in good drawings is the shading. But shading is tough to master, especially when you are trying to shade something from your imagination or memory. Shading can imply lines as well. Think about the two small ridges between your nose and upper lip. While you could draw lines for them, that would make them unrealistically pronounced. Try shading them in instead, darkening the areas around them lightly to make them \u201cappear\u201d in the middle of the dark patches."

Where the light is coming from, what type of light it is, and even the time of day will all affect your shadows. Shadows are created on opposite sides of the light. For example, if you place a ball down and shine a light on it from the right, the left side of the ball will appear darker. This is where you would shade if you were drawing the ball."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Note the edges of the shadow.",
          "description":"The edge of the shadow is how quickly it disappears. Think of trying to make a shadow puppet\u2014when your hand is close to the light and the wall, there is a hard edge where your shadow and the light meet; but when your hand is farther away you shadow softly fades into the light. Note however, the all shadows have a slightly soft edge. The difference between shading and contour drawing is the fading at the edges. Direct light, like spotlights and clear, sunny days, creates dramatic shadows with hard edges. Indirect light, light far away lights, multiple lights, or cloudy days, create softer, muted shadows with faded edges."

Map out the highlights: where is the light the strongest? Is there any glare? Sketch out the shading: where does the shadow on each object start and stop? Contour any hard shadows. Are there any dark shapes created by the light, like a person\u2019s shadow in the sun?"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Focus on gradual transitions.",
          "description":"Shading is the art of gradually changing the amount of light from one area to the other. Start lightly, shading in the entire object with your lightest pencil strokes. Keep going over the drawing by filling in the darker areas slowly, one shade at a time."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Blend your shadows.",
          "description":"This is the best way to make realistic, gradual shadows on any drawing. Using a tissue, your finger, or light marks with your pencil, blend the darker areas into the lighter ones by rubbing from dark to light. Most pencils will blend only slightly, while drawing with charcoal allows you to dramatically blend your shadows with your fingers."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Practice shading simple objects.",
          "description":"Set up a basic \u201cstill life\u201d to practice shading. Simply place several common, easy to draw objects (a ball, small boxes, water bottles, etc.) under a bright light and turn it on. Draw the contours of the objects, then practice shading them in exactly how you see them. As you get more advanced, add in clear objects, complex shapes, or a second light to practice more difficult shading techniques. Shade in an old children\u2019s coloring book, which are usually simple contour lines, for advanced practice."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Learn the different types of shading.",
          "description":"While the most realistic form of shading is an even, gradual blending (\u201csmooth\u201d shading), there are a variety of shading styles for different artists and styles of work. For example, many cartoons use cross-hatching or dots to indicate shading. The basic principle, however, is the same \u2013 more marks equals darker shadows. Test our multiple types of shading to find what works best for you. Hatching: Single, straight lines create shadows. More lines make darker shadows. Cross-hatching: Crisscrossing diagonal lines make up your shadows. The farther apart the lines are, the lighter the shadow is. This works well when shading something with lines, like hair or fur. Stippling: A collection of small, black dots make your shadows. Adding dots makes it look darker, to the point where you may not be able to tell that there are dots on the darker edges. Circular Shading: Making small, overlapping circles around with your pencil, you trace out your shadow. The longer you spend in one area overlapping circles, the darker it will become. This is often the best way to shade with colored pencils."

    "Drawing accurate contours requires more than simply looking up an image online.",
    "The best artists and art teachers pour over books, real-life examples, and studies to understand the lines they are making.",
    "While this depends on the type of drawing you are working on.",
    "All artists can benefit from time away from the sketchbook every now and then.",
    "If you are drawing people, invest in an illustrated book of human anatomy, or sign-up for drawing classes with a live model.",
    "If you are drawing animals, spend a day with your sketchbook at the zoo or purchase an illustrated textbook on animal anatomy.",
    "If you are drawing landscapes or city scenes, you should invest in a book about perspective to help you accurately create depth in your drawings.",
    "Buy a wooden art doll.",
    "These small, standing puppets have a variety of joints that you can move into place and perfect human proportions.",
    "As such, they can be useful when trying to draw complex poses.",
    "Simply put the doll into the right position and use it to sketch out your drawing, adding the details of your character later.",
    "If you cannot get a model, use a skeleton from your school\u2019s biology department to learn proportions.",
    "They also make anatomically correct models of hands, heads, and the skeletal system as well, though they are often more expensive.",
    "Wooden dolls are a very useful tool for drawing, they are a great and cheap way of learning how to draw the body.",
    "Perfecting Contour Drawing Know that contour drawing consists only of lines.",
    "Contours are the outlines of your drawings.",
    "There is no blending or shading yet, just lines.",
    "Drawing good contour lines is essential for your final drawing, as this is where you give your drawing its shape and proportions.",
    "In general, contour lines are the first thing you do in a drawing.",
    "Give yourself guide lines.",
    "This is often overlooked by beginning artists who dive right into the work, but it is incredibly important to get accurate drawings.",
    "For example, if you are drawing a large scene, start with faint lines that break your drawing up into thirds both horizontally and vertically.",
    "You should have nine small boxes on your page.",
    "These will help you to frame your drawing and put everything where it should be, giving you reference points as you work.",
    "Focus on proportions first.",
    "Proportion is the difference in size between two objects.",
    "If you draw your arms and legs out of proportion, for example, your drawing will look crude and lopsided.",
    "Close one eye and line your pencil up with the subject.",
    "Your arm should be completely extended.",
    "Use your pencil as a ruler and mark the length of the object with your thumb.",
    "You can then compare this distance with other objects on your page, or even use your pencil to mark out the specific distance on the page for your drawing.",
    "You can also use your guidelines to help.",
    "What \u201cbox\u201d of your guidelines does the subject fit into?",
    "Do they take up the whole page, or a third of it?",
    "Sketch out the basics of each drawing before moving on.",
    "There is no worse feeling than getting halfway done with a drawing and realizing that the arm of your character is much too short.",
    "Good drawers know how to avoid this by blocking out the drawing beforehand.",
    "Use simple shapes to mark the proportions of each object.",
    "For example, make an oval for a person\u2019s head, a rounded rectangle for the torso, and longer elbows for each arm and leg.",
    "Keep adjusting these blocks until you feel confident in the pose and proportions of each item.",
    "Make sure you make these marks lightly, so that you can easily erase them later.",
    "Make a small circle or dot for each joint to help you \u201cmove\u201d arms and legs into accurate poses.",
    "Slowly add in the details to your contours.",
    "Add a layer of complexity with each draft.",
    "First it is guidelines and stick figures.",
    "Then you add in basic shapes and poses.",
    "Next, add in permanent lines over your outline, connecting the joints, adding facial features, etc.",
    "Think about making the final contour of the body by connecting the joints so that you have a recognizable shape.",
    "Once you\u2019re happy with your new lines, erase away your light contour marks from underneath the new drawing.",
    "Work slowly, making each line carefully and erasing when you are unhappy.",
    "You need your contour to be accurate in order for the final drawing to improve.",
    "Draw from the largest object down to the smallest.",
    "Never start a drawing at the details.",
    "Once you\u2019ve finished you basic contours, it\u2019s time to move on to the details.",
    "This is where most artists get caught up early on, spending all of their time and energy on the small details while neglecting the larger proportions.",
    "Practice perspective to give scenes realistic depth.",
    "Perspective is why far away objects appear small and nearby ones appear large.",
    "To get accurate drawings, you need to have accurate perspective.",
    "One way to practice is to use a perspective point.",
    "Think of this as the farthest point on the horizon, like the sun right before it sets.",
    "Draw straight lines out from this point to match your drawings \u2013 anything closer to the dot is farther away, and thus smaller, and anything away from the dot is close to you.",
    "Draw two diagonal lines coming away from the dot.",
    "Anything that fits between those two lines is the same size in real life, though perspective makes it appear as if they are different.",
    "Perfecting Shading Know that shading give objects depth.",
    "Shading is what makes a drawing pop and prevents it from feeling flat.",
    "A big part of the illusion of three-dimensions in good drawings is the shading.",
    "But shading is tough to master, especially when you are trying to shade something from your imagination or memory.",
    "Shading can imply lines as well.",
    "Think about the two small ridges between your nose and upper lip.",
    "While you could draw lines for them, that would make them unrealistically pronounced.",
    "Try shading them in instead, darkening the areas around them lightly to make them \u201cappear\u201d in the middle of the dark patches.",
    "Think about the light sources.",
    "Shadows are created because they are exposed to less light then other parts of the scene.",
    "Where the light is coming from, what type of light it is, and even the time of day will all affect your shadows.",
    "Shadows are created on opposite sides of the light.",
    "For example, if you place a ball down and shine a light on it from the right, the left side of the ball will appear darker.",
    "This is where you would shade if you were drawing the ball.",
    "Note the edges of the shadow.",
    "The edge of the shadow is how quickly it disappears.",
    "Think of trying to make a shadow puppet\u2014when your hand is close to the light and the wall, there is a hard edge where your shadow and the light meet; but when your hand is farther away you shadow softly fades into the light.",
    "Note however, the all shadows have a slightly soft edge.",
    "The difference between shading and contour drawing is the fading at the edges.",
    "Direct light, like spotlights and clear, sunny days, creates dramatic shadows with hard edges.",
    "Indirect light, light far away lights, multiple lights, or cloudy days, create softer, muted shadows with faded edges.",
    "Map your shading before beginning.",
    "Make soft, gentle lines around the edges of your shadows before starting them so that you know where you are going to.",
    "Map out the highlights: where is the light the strongest?",
    "Is there any glare?",
    "Sketch out the shading: where does the shadow on each object start and stop?",
    "Contour any hard shadows.",
    "Are there any dark shapes created by the light, like a person\u2019s shadow in the sun?",
    "Focus on gradual transitions.",
    "Shading is the art of gradually changing the amount of light from one area to the other.",
    "Start lightly, shading in the entire object with your lightest pencil strokes.",
    "Keep going over the drawing by filling in the darker areas slowly, one shade at a time.",
    "Blend your shadows.",
    "This is the best way to make realistic, gradual shadows on any drawing.",
    "Using a tissue, your finger, or light marks with your pencil, blend the darker areas into the lighter ones by rubbing from dark to light.",
    "Most pencils will blend only slightly, while drawing with charcoal allows you to dramatically blend your shadows with your fingers.",
    "Practice shading simple objects.",
    "Set up a basic \u201cstill life\u201d to practice shading.",
    "Simply place several common, easy to draw objects (a ball, small boxes, water bottles, etc.)",
    "under a bright light and turn it on.",
    "Draw the contours of the objects, then practice shading them in exactly how you see them.",
    "As you get more advanced, add in clear objects, complex shapes, or a second light to practice more difficult shading techniques.",
    "Shade in an old children\u2019s coloring book, which are usually simple contour lines, for advanced practice.",
    "Learn the different types of shading.",
    "While the most realistic form of shading is an even, gradual blending (\u201csmooth\u201d shading), there are a variety of shading styles for different artists and styles of work.",
    "For example, many cartoons use cross-hatching or dots to indicate shading.",
    "The basic principle, however, is the same \u2013 more marks equals darker shadows.",
    "Test our multiple types of shading to find what works best for you.",
    "Hatching: Single, straight lines create shadows.",
    "More lines make darker shadows.",
    "Cross-hatching: Crisscrossing diagonal lines make up your shadows.",
    "The farther apart the lines are, the lighter the shadow is.",
    "This works well when shading something with lines, like hair or fur.",
    "Stippling: A collection of small, black dots make your shadows.",
    "Adding dots makes it look darker, to the point where you may not be able to tell that there are dots on the darker edges.",
    "Circular Shading: Making small, overlapping circles around with your pencil, you trace out your shadow.",
    "The longer you spend in one area overlapping circles, the darker it will become.",
    "This is often the best way to shade with colored pencils."
