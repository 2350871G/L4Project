          "description":"Make sure the chicken you\u2019re using is completely defrosted before you put your dry rub on it. Take the chicken you plan on seasoning with the dry rub and set it inside a baking pan so you don\u2019t spread any bacteria. Blot paper towels on each side of the chicken to absorb some of the excess juices and contaminants on its surface. Continue patting all sides of the chicken until the paper towels look clean after you blot them. Always wash your hands after you handle raw chicken since it contains bacteria that could lead to food poisoning.Warning: Don\u2019t rinse or wash chicken in your sink before you cook it since you could spread bacteria to other foods, utensils, or surfaces in your kitchen."

          "description":"Olive oil helps the dry rub adhere to the meat so it\u2019s less likely to fall off while you\u2019re cooking it. Put a coin-sized amount of olive oil on the chicken and spread it evenly across the sides of the chicken. Only use a small amount of olive oil, or else the dry rub will run off the meat and you\u2019ll lose the flavor. You don\u2019t need to use olive oil with your dry rub if you don\u2019t want to. If you don\u2019t have olive oil, you can use any vegetable oil to help the dry rub stick."

          "description":"Use your nondominant hand to scoop the dry rub out from its container and put it directly onto the chicken. You can use as much or as little dry rub as you want, but usually 1 tablespoon (8 g) of dry rub for every 1 pound (450 g) of meat you\u2019re cooking. Make sure you coat all sides of the chicken so the dry rub covers the entire piece of meat. Avoid touching the chicken with the spoon you use to scoop if you want to save the dry rub later. Otherwise, you\u2019ll contaminate the dry rub and you\u2019ll need to throw it away."

Work with the grain of the meat so the dry rub sticks to all of the hard to reach areas on the chicken. Continue rubbing the spices into all sides of the meat until it\u2019s completely coated. Always try to keep one of your hands clean so you don\u2019t accidentally contaminate other surfaces in your kitchen with bacteria. You can leave the rub in a \u20448 in (0.32 cm) crust on the meat, which will help lock in moisture so your chicken tastes juicier."

Put the seasoned chicken in your fridge and use it in about 1-2 days so the meat doesn\u2019t spoil. You can also use resealable plastic bags to store your chicken. Avoid wrapping your chicken in plastic wrap, since the wrapping could remove some of the rub from the meat."
