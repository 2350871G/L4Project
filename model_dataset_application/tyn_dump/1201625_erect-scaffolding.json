It is possible to assemble a scaffold on sloped ground, but this is a complex job that requires leg extensions and other supports for the structure. It\u2019s best to leave that sort of job to professionals. For simple maintenance projects, construct your scaffold on flat ground. Constructing the Scaffold Base Lay out all the scaffolding pieces near your worksite. Prepare for the job by placing all the necessary pieces near your worksite so you don\u2019t have to move the scaffold into place later. Then lay out the 2 base sections of the scaffold a few feet apart with their bottom edges facing each other. Most home scaffold kits only have 1 level, so the 2 metal frames form the base section. Multi-level scaffold kits might have additional poles that attach to the base and create another platform. Slide the adjusting screws into the scaffold base. Adjusting screws set the height for the scaffold. A scaffold set should have 4 of them. If the scaffold forms a square or rectangle, an adjusting screw goes into each corner. Set each screw to the lowest level before installing it. Then slide one into the bottom of each scaffold support pole. On most scaffold models, the screws slide in without any other method of attachment. Check your model to see if there is an additional attachment for the screws. Attach baseplates if you\u2019re only working in one place. Baseplates are flat platforms that attach to the adjusting screws. Use them if you don\u2019t plan on moving your scaffold to another location while you work. Take a baseplate and fit it onto the adjusting screw at the bottom of the scaffold.
