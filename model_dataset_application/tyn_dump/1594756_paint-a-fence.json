Pulling vegetation away from the fence gives you space to work, protects the plants from being covered by paint, and reduces the risk of your newly painted surface being blemished by plants rubbing against it. You can use a leaf blower to blow dirt and grass clippings away from the fence line."

Put plastic sheeting or a drop cloth over plants that might accidentally get paint on them. Just be careful to make sure that the plant can handle the weight of whatever masking you use. You can also slide a sheet of plywood between your fence and shrubs. This protects the vegetation from paint toxins. When the surface has dried, pull out the plywood and the shrub will likely snap back naturally.Tip: Preparation is a critical phase of fence painting. This is a time-consuming process, but it makes the job easier in the long run."

However, you should also consider what type of paint you\u2019re using and how detailed the work will be. For example, some paints are formulated to be used with either brushes or sprayers and state so on their labels. Use a sprayer for a long fence or a fence with lots of cutouts or spots that will be hard for a brush to get into. If you have a long fence, you probably will want to use a sprayer because it will allow you to complete the job quickly. A sprayer is also good at getting into every crevice, so use one if your fence has detailed scrolling work. If you have a smaller project, such as a short section of fence, you probably can complete the job using a roller on flat surfaces and a brush for detailed, inside sections."

Even if spraying you should move the sprayer in the direction of the wood grain to get into all areas of the wood. Going with the grain also helps prevent drips, as excess paint doesn\u2019t build up on the ridges of the wood as much.

If you want to spray the paint on, you need to decide between using a paint sprayer or cans of spray paint. Spray paint is only really appropriate for painting small fences. If you use brushes, be sure to use brushes that are compatible with your type of paint. For instance, if you are using enamel paint, look for brushes that say they can be used with enamel paint.

As you apply the primer, be sure that you cover every surface of the fence. Allow the primer to dry completely before applying the paint.
