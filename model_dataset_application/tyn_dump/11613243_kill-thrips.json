After removing the adhesive backing paper, use a plastic tie to knot and secure each sticky sheet near any vents, doors, or other openings that a thrips bug could pass through. Monitor how many thrips are caught on each card over the span of 1 week, then replace the sheet with a new sticky trap. Sticky card traps come in both yellow and blue. Blue cards tend to attract only thrips, while yellow cards attract a variety of garden pests. You can find both at your local garden supply store. These traps work especially well in an indoor garden or greenhouse. You can use these traps to figure out how severe your thrips problem is.Did you know? It\u2019s not necessarily bad if you find thrips in your garden or greenhouse. There are a variety of thrips species, including a parasitic group that feeds on other thrips. Don\u2019t worry about an infestation unless you see physical damage to your flowers and crops."

          "description":"Check your local gardening store or a specialty website for thrips predators that you can introduce to your garden or greenhouse. Opt for bugs like mites, green lacewings, and minute pirate bugs, or other predatory pests, like parasitic wasps. Before introducing any new species to your garden, speak with a horticulture specialist to see what options are best for your garden. These predatory bugs exist naturally in some gardens. To welcome these predators into your space, include a variety of different plant species in your garden."

After you mulch your garden, unroll a tube of silver or gray reflective mulch wrap directly next to your row of plants. Use bricks or cinder blocks to hold the gray or silver wrap in place, so it doesn\u2019t blow away. To finish the process, arrange and secure another section of reflective mulch along the opposite, uncovered side of your plant row. You can apply reflective mulch at the beginning of the season, before any crops sprout. If possible, opt for a silver or gray reflective mulch.

For the most efficiency, apply the insecticide once every 5 days. After 2 months, switch to a new insecticide so the thrips won\u2019t develop immunity. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t see any immediate results; depending on the circumstances, you might not notice any improvements until the next gardening season. If you\u2019re looking for a more natural insecticide option, try spinosad.

Every 4 to 7 days, use a spray bottle or insecticide sprayer filled with soap and distilled water to coat your plants. To prevent any damage to your plants, rinse off any soapy crops 1-2 hours after you applied the insecticide. Be careful with insecticides\u2014even if you\u2019re killing off the thrips, you might also be killing off valuable bug species in the process. Neem oil is also a natural insecticide treatment against thrips."
