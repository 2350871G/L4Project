To easily weigh the picture, hold it as you step onto a scale and then subtract your weight from the total. For heavier pictures, you'll want to use a wire installed across the back of the frame."

Hold it down in place and make a visible mark through each nail hole so that you'll be able to quickly find your place again in case you accidentally drop the hanger. A lot of sawtooth hangers have a mark in the very center to make it easier to line it up on the back of the frame."

Repeat this action on the opposite side. The nail will be really short so it doesn't go through the front of the frame, so be careful to not catch your fingers with the hammer. Some sawtooth kits come with nails, and some come with screws. Use whatever came with your kit to ensure the hanger is properly attached. If it came with screws, you'll need to use a screwdriver rather than a hammer. The sawtooth hanger needs to be attached to the frame. Even if there is sturdy canvas paper covering the back of the picture, chances are the hanger will just rip through it once you place the picture up on the wall."

Some sawtooth kits come with small hooks that go on the nail. This hook latches into the sawtooth hanger, rather than just hanging the picture from the nail.
