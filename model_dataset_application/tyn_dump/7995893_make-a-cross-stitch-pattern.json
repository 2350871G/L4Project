Just make sure to choose a picture with well defined lines and some good contrast in the color scheme. This will make it easier to convert the photo into a cross stitch pattern. Use a photo of a flower, a tree, or clouds for a simple design. Opt for a photo of a person or landscape for something more advanced. It helps if the photo is already the desired size for your cross stitch. However, you could always photocopy or scan the image and resize it."

For example, if you are new to cross stitch, you might draw a simple flower, some balloons, or a tree. If you want something more advanced, you might draw a puppy, a sunset, or a person. Drawing freehand is also a good way to form letters and words for your cross stitch."
