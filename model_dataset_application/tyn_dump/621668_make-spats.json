On the parts of the boot where the two segments of leather are sewn together (front and back), a half-inch seam allowance is necessary to create leeway. Add this half-inch to the pattern paper where the original pattern was traced.  Add an inch and a half to the original pattern to create leeway where the button seam is.  The pattern is ready to be cut out after one final adjustment. The triangle represents the excess seam allowance. Cut the pattern  along the outlines and include the seam allowance.  Fold the pattern along the button and button hole line.  Cut off the excess along the bottom of the seam allowance.  The leather is ready to be traced and cut out based on the patterns. You should have three pieces of the patterns now. Weigh the patterns down on the leather and trace them with a ball-point pen.
