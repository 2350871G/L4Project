Sand the top and sides of the shoes wherever you note flakes. Sand in tight circles and be sure to apply plenty of pressure to the shoe. You can purchase sandpaper at any hardware store. Pick up at least 4 sheets for this project."

This will improve the appearance of the shoes. So, if you\u2019re repairing brown shoes, use a brown permanent marker. Do your best to find a marker that matches the color of the shoes.

Be sure to apply the shoe polish evenly, so that the shoes have a uniform color across all surfaces. As with the marker, the shoe polish should match the color of the shoe.
