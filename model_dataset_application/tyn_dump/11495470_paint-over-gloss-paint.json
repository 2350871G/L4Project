  "text":" Creating a Safe Workspace Remove furniture, decor, or anything else that could get in your way. Clear out any obstacles that could get in your way while you\u2019re working paint over the gloss paint. Take out chairs and furniture, take down any paintings or wall art, and keep out any people or pets who could get in the way. If you\u2019re painting over a small item that has gloss paint, such as a vase, make sure your workspace is clear of any obstructions. Lay down a drop cloth to protect your floor from paint. Use plastic sheeting or drop cloths to cover the floor as well as anything else you want to keep protected from paint. Even if the area isn\u2019t directly beneath what you\u2019re painting, the paint can drip or splatter, so be sure to cover the area well.

You can find plastic sheeting and drop cloths at paint supply stores, at home improvement stores, and online. Use painter\u2019s tape to mask off areas you don\u2019t want to get paint on. Tape off the floorboards and tape the edges of your plastic sheeting or drop cloths so they\u2019re flush against the edges and will keep paint out. Apply the tape to any trim or any other areas you want to be protected. Wear rubber gloves and a face mask for safety. Put on a pair of gloves to keep paint from getting onto your hands.

You can find rubber gloves and face masks at home improvement stores, at department stores, and online. De-glossing the Paint Sand the paint in circular motions with 180-grit sandpaper.
