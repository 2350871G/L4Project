If you can't find a block in the right size, choose a piece that is slight larger, as you can always cut it to size later. Soft wood like pine, beech, or spruce generally makes for good wooden signs. Some large businesses also discard their wood from pallets or boxes when they're done using them. Contact businesses in your area and ask if they have extra lumber to get wood for free."

Scrub the entire surface of the wood block with the washcloth, focusing on particularly dirty or dusty areas. If you just bought the wood from a store and it looks clean, you may not need to wash it.

Then, secure the wood block to a flat surface with clamps and cut along the tape's line with a hand or electric saw. Wear goggles and earplugs while cutting with saws, and work carefully to prevent injuries or uneven lines. The tape prevents the wood edges from splintering while you cut it."
