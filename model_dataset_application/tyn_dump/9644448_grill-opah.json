Making Grilled Opah Fish Tacos Light a charcoal grill or turn a gas grill to high. To heat the charcoal grill, fill a chimney with briquettes and light them. Dump the hot, ashy briquettes in the center of the grill grate and lightly oil the grate. This will prevent the fish from sticking to it.

Let your guests assemble their own opah tacos. Refrigerate the leftover opah in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days. Making Blackened Opah on the Grill Combine the blackening seasoning in a small bowl. Mix together 2 teaspoons (11 g) of sea salt, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of fresh cracked pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons (3 g) of paprika, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of dried thyme, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of cayenne. Brush the opah with butter or oil and rub the blackening seasoning over it. Lay 1 to 2 pieces of opah on a plate and brush 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of melted butter or olive oil over the fish. Spread the blackening seasoning evenly over the fish. Use your fingers to rub the seasoning into the fish and set it aside while you heat the grill. Heat a gas or charcoal grill. Turn a gas grill to high or heat a full chimney of briquettes. Once the briquettes are hot and lightly covered in ash, dump them in the center of the grill grate. Brush a little canola or vegetable oil on the grate to prevent the fish from sticking to it. Grill the opah for 5 minutes. Lay the seasoned opah on the grill so it's directly over the briquettes or the hottest part of the grill. Cook the opah for 5 minutes so it blackens on the bottom. Flip and grill the opah for 3 to 5 more minutes. Use tongs to flip the fish over and grill it until it's cooked on the outside. The opah will be medium-rare after 3 to 5 minutes, but you could cook it 2 to 3 more minutes, if you prefer your fish well-done. If the fish is medium-rare, it will be soft and tender. Well-done fish will be completely dry, firm, and flaky. Serve the blackened opah. Remove the opah from the grill and serve it immediately.
