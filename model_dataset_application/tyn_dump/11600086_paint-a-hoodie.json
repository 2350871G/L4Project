          "description":"Put your hoodie in the washing machine and set it to the warmest cycle. Add detergent as you normally would, but don\u2019t use fabric softener since it can affect how well the paint will adhere. When the washer finishes running, set your dryer to the hottest setting and run the hoodie through the full cycle until it\u2019s dry.Pre-shrinking your shirt prevents the paint from cracking or chipping after you add your design to the hoodie. You can paint on any kind of hoodie, but paint will work best on cotton."

          "description":"Use a piece of cardboard that\u2019s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) narrower than the bottom of the hoodie. Push the cardboard into the bottom hole of the hoodie so the fabric lies flat on the surface. Smooth out any wrinkles on the surface that you want to paint so your design doesn\u2019t get distorted while you\u2019re working on it.The cardboard will also prevent the paint from bleeding through to the other side of the hoodie.Tip: If the fabric doesn\u2019t stay in place, clip it to the sides of the cardboard with clothespins every 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm)."

Fold a drop cloth in half before setting it on top of the work surface to protect it from any spills or spatters. Set the hoodie down so there\u2019s at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of drop cloth extending out from each side.If you don\u2019t have a drop cloth, cut a garbage bag in half and spread it out on your work surface instead.

Mix black paint with a color if you want to make it a darker shade.

Taking Care of Your Hoodie Wait 24 hours for the paint to dry completely. Leave the hoodie undisturbed on your work surface so it has time to dry. Usually, the paint will take about 1 day to completely dry, but it may depend on the thickness of the paint. Tap the paint with your finger to see if any of it lifts up. If it does, allow the paint to dry for another hour before checking it again.Try setting up a fan on low speed near your hoodie to help speed up the drying process. Avoid hanging the hoodie to let the paint dry since the colors could run and drip. Hold a hot iron 2 in (5.1 cm) over the design to heat-set the paint. Turn your iron on to the hottest setting and let it heat up. Keep the iron at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the paint and move it over the entire surface of the hoodie. Continue moving the iron around for 4\u20135 minutes so the paint doesn\u2019t fade.Avoid touching the iron directly on the paint since you may damage some of the paint or ruin the design.Variation: You can also flip the hoodie over so the painted side is face-down and run the iron on the back side. That way, you can set the iron down. Wash your hoodie inside-out on the gentle cycle 5 days after painting it. Wait at least 5 days to ensure that the paint completely sets on the fabric. Turn the hoodie inside-out to reduce the chances of the design fading in the wash. Choose the cycle labeled \u201cGentle\u201d or \u201cDelicates\u201d and use detergent and fabric softener as you normally would.You can also wash the hoodie by hand if you\u2019re worried about damaging it in your washer. Hang the hoodie up to dry to prevent cracking. Avoid using your dryer since the heat can damage or crack the paint. Put the hoodie on a hanger and keep it in a spot that has good airflow so it can dry. Allow the hoodie to dry completely before wearing it or putting it away.Avoid putting the hoodie in direct sunlight since it can also damage the paint or cause the design to fade.",
