You can use a measuring cup, but it's easier to just eyeball it. Roll in each round into chapattis. A chapatti is a thin, flat circular bread or dough.

After each batch is finished frying, use a slotted spoon to move the finished samosas to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off the extra oil.
