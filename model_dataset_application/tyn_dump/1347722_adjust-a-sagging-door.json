Hold the bubble level against the door jamb\u2019s left and right sides and top, and check to see if the bubble settles between the viewer\u2019s two lines. You can hold the carpenter\u2019s square, or steel square, to the door jamb\u2019s four corners to determine if they deviate from 90 degrees. You might find that the door is level, but the frame is off square. If the frame is out of square, you might have other problems, like a shifted wall or settling foundation. In this situation, you might find planing to be your only solution."

Use the thinnest materials possible so you can add layers to the hinge mortise one at a time until the door is level again. You might have to install shims on more than one hinge.

Then, once you\u2019ve taken off the hinge, you\u2019ll carve out a deeper new pocket with a chisel.First, score the outline of the hinges you want to mortise with a utility knife. Remove the hinges. Take the chisel and position it on the scored line perpendicular to the door jamb. Lightly tap the chisel to deepen the scoring a bit. Do the same around the whole perimeter. Once you\u2019ve finished the perimeter, use the chisel to make a series of cuts about 1/8 inch apart. The mortise depth will depend in part on how much the door sags.

  "text":" Inspecting the Door, Hinges, and Frame Find the sagging door\u2019s cause. Inspect the door from inside, or the side from where you can see the hinges.
