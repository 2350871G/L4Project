Open the jaws of the calipers wide enough so you can put the screw between them. Tighten the jaws around the main shaft of the screw, but not on the threading, which is the raised area that rotates around the screw. Read the measurement on the side of the calipers to know the diameter of the screw\u2019s shaft. You can buy calipers from your local hardware store.

Install the bit you\u2019re using in the drill\u2019s chuck, which is the rotating part that locks it in place. You can buy a set of multiple drill bits from your local hardware store. There are many tables and guides online that specify how big pilot holes need to be depending on what size screw you have.Tip: If you aren\u2019t able to measure the drill bit, hold it in front of the screw so it lines up with the shaft. If you don\u2019t see any of the screw\u2019s threading behind the bit, then the drill bit is too large for making a pilot hole."

Tighten the jaws on the clamp to secure the piece of wood so it doesn\u2019t rotate or shift while you\u2019re trying to drill into it. Try pushing the piece of wood to see if it moves or shifts.

The dent will give the drill a good starting point so it doesn\u2019t slip or shift while you\u2019re making your hole.

Wear safety glasses while you drill your hole so you don\u2019t get sawdust in your eyes. Don\u2019t force the drill bit into the wood since you could cause it to break, and you could seriously hurt yourself. If you want an easy reminder of how deep you need to drill, wrap a piece of masking tape around the drill bit so it\u2019s at the same length as the screw.

The time it takes for your putty to dry depends on how much you use and how deep the hole is, but it usually takes around 6-8 hours for it to fully harden. Try touching it with your finger to see if any lifts up or still feels tacky to the touch. Some wood putties come with a hardening agent to help promote faster drying.
