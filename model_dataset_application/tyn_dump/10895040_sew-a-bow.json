To make a smaller or larger bow, simply vary the size of the fabric. Pull the short edge on the right of your piece of fabric over to meet the other short edge on the left. Then, smooth the fabric down so that it sits flat on the table. Cotton, linen, and polyester fabrics work well for this task. This method creates a bow that looks similar to the bow that you would see on a bow tie."
