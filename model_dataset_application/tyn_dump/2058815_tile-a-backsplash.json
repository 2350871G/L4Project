The size of the area will determine the number of tiles you\u2019ll need to buy, as well as the space you\u2019ll need to prepare, so keep this information noted down when purchasing your equipment. Your backsplash should start slightly above the countertop in your kitchen. The top could either meet with the underside of your kitchen cabinets or could stop at any chosen place up the wall. If you don\u2019t know where you want your backsplash to end, wait until you know the size of the tiles you want to use. Make your backsplash a certain number of tiles high, rather than a predetermined height. Measure the height and width of the backsplash and keep these noted down. This will give you a guide for the number of tiles you need to cover the area, as well as a note of the total area you need to tile if you multiply the two numbers together."

Find a wall tile which matches the desired look for your kitchen, and purchase enough to cover the chosen area. Talk to the tile salesperson or someone at your local hardware store to work out how many tiles you'll need. Divide the area of your backsplash by the area of a single tile or tile sheet to get a rough idea of how many tiles you'll need. If you\u2019ll need to cut the tiles to fit into corners or underneath cabinets, it may help to purchase more tiles than you need to make up for tiles that break while cutting. Wall tiles tend to be thinner and more lightweight than flooring tiles. Make sure you choose the right type of tile for your project. Slate tiles have a tendency to crumble when they are cut, so may be more difficult to work with if you\u2019ve not used them before. Ceramic tiles, or other types of mosaic tiles, will be easier to work with and cut."

Use a medium-grit sandpaper, around 80 or 120-grit, to sand down the entire surface you want to tile. If your surface has a lot of grease stains, it may help to clean them up before sanding. Use a cloth dampened in a mixture of water and dishwashing liquid to wipe them away, giving the wall plenty of time to dry before you attempt to sand it down."

Mastic is a thin adhesive used for adhering tiles to a wall. It should be available at your local hardware store or online. Use a firm pressure when applying the mastic, so that the trowel is pressed against the wall. You should be able to just see the wall between the thicker lines of mastic. Mastic will begin to form a skin after around 10 minutes, which will stop the tiles from adhering to it. Apply mastic in sections that are small enough for you to tile before it hardens.

Make sure the tile is lined up properly and perfectly straight before moving on. Most tiles will have built-in spacers to ensure you leave enough room between tiles. If your tiles do not have built-in spacers, use external tile spacers or wedges to leave a gap between your countertop and the first tile. If the tile slides around too much, it may be a sign that you\u2019ve used too much mastic. Remove the tile, scrape away the mastic, and try again with a thinner layer."

    "Leave it for 45 minutes to an hour to completely set up, avoiding touching the tiles or grout while it dries.",
    "If you notice any clumps of grout that have built up in the corners or along the edges of your backsplash, remove them at this point.",
    "If they don\u2019t wipe away with a sponge, use a utility knife to scrape them up and discard of them.",
    "Line the edges of your backsplash with caulk.",
    "Caulk is a sealant that will help stop water or moisture from getting behind your tiles and damaging the mastic.",
    "Use a caulk gun or caulk pen to trace around all edges of your backsplash, sealing the tiles completely.",
    "Run a wet finger over the caulk to smooth it, before leaving it to dry.",
    "Use a caulk that matches with the color of the grout to prevent it from standing out.",
    "Give the tiles plenty of time dry, ideally overnight.",
    "Once your tiling is finished and sealed, leave it for a further 24 hours to ensure that the mastic, grout, and caulk, are all given plenty of time to dry before you interact with them.",
    "This will ensure that your tiling sets and that it will last for years to come."
