  "text":" Making a Deco Mesh Pumpkin Wreath Get a 12 to 24-inch (30.48 to 60.96-centimeter) metal floral wreath. If you can't find one, you can also use a grapevine or willow wreath instead. Do not use a Styrofoam wreath, as you won't be able to tie the deco mesh to it very well. Cut five, orange pipe cleaners in half so that you end up with ten, 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) mini pipe cleaners. It might be a good idea to use a pair of wire cutters for this, so that you don't ruin your scissors. If you cannot find any pipe cleaners, cut some floral wire into ten, 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) long pieces. The orange pipe cleaners will blend in better, however. You may also find pipe cleaners labeled as \"chenille stems.\" Imagine your wreath as a clock, then tie each pipe cleaner to each clock position, except for 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock. Most floral wreaths have several \"rows\" or rings; you are only tying the pipe cleaners to the outermost ring.

You want to end up with a pipe cleaner tie in the following clock positions: 1, 2, 4 to 8, and 10 to 12.

You will be pulling the mesh downward, thus hiding this stub. Twist the pipe cleaners tightly around the deco mesh to hold it in place. Fold the pipe cleaner over to the left, so that it points towards the center of the wreath and out of sight. Gently pull the deco mesh downward to the 4 o'clock position, and tie it in place. This will cover the 2 o'clock pipe cleaner. Gather up the deco mesh again, and twist the pipe cleaner ties around it to hold it in place. When you are done, fold the pipe cleaner down, and out of sight. Don't pull the deco mesh too hard, or it won't \"puff\" out like a pumpkin. Do not cut the deco mesh. You will be pulling it back and forth across the top of the wreath in a zigzag pattern. Gently pull the deco mesh back up to the 1 o'clock position. This will cover the pipe cleaner ties at the 4 o'clock position. Continue pulling the deco mesh back and forth across the front of the wreath. At you reach each clock pint, twist the pipe cleaners around the deco mesh, then fold them towards the center of the wreath. Here are the directions you should be weaving in:\nFrom 1 o'clock, pull the mesh down to 5 o'clock. Pull the mesh up from 5 o'clock to 12 o'clock. Pull the mesh down from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock. Pull the mesh up from 6 o'clock to 11 o'clock. Pull the mesh down from 11 o'clock to 7 o'clock. Pull the mesh up from 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock. Finish by pulling the mesh from 10 o'clock down to 8 o'clock. Fold the deco mesh over the top of the wreath and towards the back. Pull the pipe cleaners to the back of the wreath, and twist the tightly around the deco mesh, tying it firmly in place. Trim off the excess mesh so that you have a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) long stub. Roll a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) wide strip of burlap ribbon into a tube to make the stem. Cut a strip of burlap ribbon. It does not need to be very long; about 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) will do. Roll the ribbon into a tube. If you want a neater finish, hot glue the end down. This will create a smoother seam. You can also use 5\u00bd or 6-inch (13.97 or 15.24-centimeter) wide green deco mesh instead. Tie the stem to the back of the pumpkin. Position the stem so that about an inch (2.54 centimeters) or so is behind the pumpkin. Tie the stem in place using a piece of floral wire. If you have any orange pipe cleaners left over, you can use one of those instead. If you are using a grapevine or willow wreath, you may be able to just stuff the stem down between the vines. Cut two strips of 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide green, mesh ribbon to make the leaves. How long you cut the ribbon depends on the side of your pumpkin. If you have a smaller pumpkin, about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) wide, then 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) long strips will do. If you have a larger pumpkin, go for 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) long strips. You can also use narrow, green deco mesh for this. Choose something that is close to 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) long. Tie the strips together about the middle, then cut V-shaped notches into each end. Stack the two ribbon pieces, one on top of the other, and wrap a piece of floral wire tightly around the middle. Cut a V-shaped notch into each end of the ribbon. Leave enough wire so that you can tie the leaves to the pumpkin. Tie the leaves to the base of the stem. Once you have the leaves secure, gently fan the leaves out. If the ribbon had wire in it, you can shape the leaves by giving them a slight curve. If your pumpkin is very puffy, you may have to pull the leaves downward in front of the pumpkin so that they are visible. Cut two long pieces of green deco mesh tubing to make the vines. If you can't find any green deco mesh tubing, you can cut long strips of narrow, green deco mesh, and roll them into tubes. Tie the vines around the middle to the back of the stem. Hold the tubes together, then wrap a piece of floral wire about the middle to hold them. Next, tie the tubes to the top of the pumpkin by winding the wire around the stem and the floral wreath. You can cut the tubes down to different lengths. If you tug on the tubes, you can make them thinner and longer. Fold some of the tubes back up to the stem to make a loop, then tie the loops in place. Gently fluff the deco mesh out. This will give body to your pumpkin, and create the creases/ribs that real pumpkins have.

Then, you can use the loop to hang the wreath from your door. Making a Tulle Pumpkin Wreath Paint an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) Styrofoam ring orange. This will help conceal any gaps that might show up in the end. The best type of paint to use would be acrylic paint. Spray paint will be quicker, but some types of spray paint can dissolve Styrofoam. Choose a tube-shaped Styrofoam ring, as opposed to one that is flat on the back. It will be easier to wrap the tulle around it. 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) may seem small, but the tulle will make the wreath appear bigger in the end. Cut the orange tulle into 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long strips. You will need 1 to 2 spools, depending on how full you want your wreath to be. The more tulle you use, the fuller it will be.

For a fuller, fluffier pumpkin, use two pieces of tulle for each tie. Keep tying the tulle around the pumpkin until the entire ring is covered. Push the pieces of tulle together as you tie them. This will give you a denser, fuller wreath. Cut a \"stem\" from a sheet of brown craft foam. To create a simple stem, just cut a brown rectangle.

Hot glue the stem to the back of the wreath, so that it sticks out over the top of the pumpkin. Before the glue sets, pull apart some of the tulle wisps to either side of the stem.

    "Fold some of the tubes back up to the stem to make a loop, then tie the loops in place.",
    "Gently fluff the deco mesh out.",
    "This will give body to your pumpkin, and create the creases/ribs that real pumpkins have.",
    "At this point, you can also gently shift the leaves and the vines about, so that they lay nicely on top of the pumpkin.",
    "Hang the wreath up.",
    "You can carefully hang the wreath from a nail on your door or wall.",
    "If you have a special wreath hanger (the type that goes over the top of your door), you will need to thread some ribbon or string through the top of your metal wreath, and tie it into a loop first.",
    "Then, you can use the loop to hang the wreath from your door.",
    "Making a Tulle Pumpkin Wreath Paint an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) Styrofoam ring orange.",
    "This will help conceal any gaps that might show up in the end.",
    "The best type of paint to use would be acrylic paint.",
    "Spray paint will be quicker, but some types of spray paint can dissolve Styrofoam.",
    "Choose a tube-shaped Styrofoam ring, as opposed to one that is flat on the back.",
    "It will be easier to wrap the tulle around it.",
    "8 inches (20.32 centimeters) may seem small, but the tulle will make the wreath appear bigger in the end.",
    "Cut the orange tulle into 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long strips.",
    "You will need 1 to 2 spools, depending on how full you want your wreath to be.",
    "The more tulle you use, the fuller it will be.",
    "To make the cutting quicker: wrap the tulle around a 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long piece of cardboard, then snip through each end to create lots of 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long strips.",
    "Tie a piece of tulle around the ring.",
    "Wrap the tulle around the wreath form, then tie it in a double-knot.",
    "Position the tulle so that the knot and \"fluffy\" ends are on the outside of the ring.",
    "For a fuller, fluffier pumpkin, use two pieces of tulle for each tie.",
    "Keep tying the tulle around the pumpkin until the entire ring is covered.",
    "Push the pieces of tulle together as you tie them.",
    "This will give you a denser, fuller wreath.",
    "Cut a \"stem\" from a sheet of brown craft foam.",
    "To create a simple stem, just cut a brown rectangle.",
    "To create a fancier stem, consider giving it bit of a curve, and making it taper outward towards one end.",
    "Look at pictures of real pumpkin stems to get ideas.",
    "Hot glue the stem to the back of the wreath, so that it sticks out over the top of the pumpkin.",
    "Before the glue sets, pull apart some of the tulle wisps to either side of the stem.",
    "This will make it more visible.",
    "Cut a 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long strip of green tulle, and make a knot in the middle.",
    "If you don't want to buy a whole spool of green tulle, you can use some green, mesh ribbon instead.",
    "For fluffier leaves, use two pieces of tulle instead.",
    "Cut the ends into V-shaped notches to give them some more texture.",
    "Hot glue the knot to the back of the stem.",
    "Before the glue sets, spread the green tulle outwards so that it sticks out to either side of the stem.",
    "Cut a long piece of green ribbon.",
    "The ribbon needs to be long enough to fit over the top of your stem; this way, you can hang your wreath without the stem getting in the way.",
    "You can use plain, green ribbon, or something fancier, such as pompom trim.",
    "Hot glue the ribbon a few inches to either side of the stem, then use it to hang your wreath.",
    "You can hang this wreath from a nail or from a wreath hanger.",
    "Be careful not to get it wet, or the orange paint will run, and ruin your door or wall."
