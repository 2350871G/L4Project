Note that the baking soda will not dissolve, but it should be completely soaked. This homemade fabric softener is often praised by people who have hard water. Baking soda regulates the pH level in your rinse water, preventing it from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. It also cancels out mineral deposits, like those found in hard water.

The vinegar will react with the baking soda, causing a fizzy chemical reaction. Do not pour the vinegar too quickly or you will end up with a mess. Vinegar strips soap and residue from clothing and also helps to soften hard water. Some believe that the vinegar and baking soda cancel each other out, making them ineffective. The salt that is produced from the chemical reaction acts as a buffer in the rinse cycle, however. Moreover, many of the elements that help soften clothes remain in the solution even after the reaction occurs."

If using scent booster, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of the crystals to your water and stir until dissolved. Scent booster is usually found in the laundry aisle. It is not a natural product, so it may not be preferable from an ecological sense, but it will lend your fabric softener a pleasant scent and may save you money in the long run."

You can technically use this method without the use of essential oils, but since the softening effects are less powerful than a liquid fabric softener alternative, it would make more sense to take advantage of the deodorizing and re-scenting abilities of this method.
