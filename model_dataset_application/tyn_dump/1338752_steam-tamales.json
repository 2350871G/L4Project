Adjust the position of the plate until it sits evenly over the 3 aluminium balls. Choose a plate that is heat-proof so that it doesn\u2019t crack or melt when the water starts to boil. Look at the bottom of the plate for a heat-proof sign to indicate that it is safe to use. If the plate is ceramic or made from thick glass, it safe to use."
