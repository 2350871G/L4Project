          "description":"Use about 2 \u20442 lb (1.1 kg) of Russet potatoes for a batch of fries. Remove the skins with a potato peeler, then use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to slice all the potatoes in half. Cut the halves into sticks about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide and \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick. Russet potatoes and sweet potatoes hold their shape well, making them the best options for fries. Other types, including red potatoes, are usable, but keep a close eye on them as they cook to prevent them from falling apart."

          "description":"Fill a bowl with cold water, submerge the potatoes, and swirl them around in the bowl for a few seconds. When you\u2019re done, drain the water and pat the potatoes dry with a paper towel. The water removes excess starch, leading to crispier fries. To prevent the potatoes from browning, leave them in the water as you prepare the other ingredients. This usually isn\u2019t necessary, but it helps if you aren\u2019t able to fry them right away."

          "description":"Pour about 1 cup (240 mL) of vegetable oil into a large pot. Make sure the oil is deep enough to cover the potatoes when you add them in batches later. Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the oil reaches a hot enough temperature. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, dip a wooden spoon into the oil to test it. Hot oil will continue to bubble steadily despite the spoon. Another way to get a good fry is to add the oil to a tabletop deep fryer. Add the seasoning after the fries are done cooking. It\u2019s great if you want crisp, plain fries with nothing but salt."

Include 1 teaspoon (6.9 g) of paprika for extra flavor. Experiment with the seasoning to customize your fries. For example, use onion powder in place of the onion salt. Include a little bit of cayenne pepper to spice up your fries."

It will drizzle off the spoon when it\u2019s the right consistency. The batter coats the potatoes, giving them a crispy, flavorful coating. An alternative is to fry the potato sticks without the batter, then sprinkle the dry seasonings on them before serving."

Adding the potatoes to the pot causes the oil temperature to drop. If you add more than a handful of sticks at a time, the oil will be too cold to fry the potatoes properly."

Let the fries cool while the excess oil drains off of them. If you have a wire cooling rack, set the fries on top of it. Place a plate or paper towels underneath the rack to catch the hot oil.

Then, scrub them all over with a nylon kitchen brush or vegetable scrubbing brush until you no longer notice any dirt falling off of them. To cut the potatoes to size, slice them in half lengthwise, then divide them lengthwise into thirds. The resulting wedges will be about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick.

Oven fries take longer to make than those done in oil, so keep this in mind when choosing your tools. Baking the potatoes gives you a little more freedom when seasoning.

If you don\u2019t plan on melting cheese or adding more herbs, you don\u2019t need to take the fries out.

    "To cut the potatoes to size, slice them in half lengthwise, then divide them lengthwise into thirds.",
    "The resulting wedges will be about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick.",
    "If you wish to remove the skin, peel it off after washing the potatoes.",
    "Skinless potatoes are best for smaller sticks cut to \u20444 in (0.64 cm) wide.",
    "Cover the potatoes with cold water for 30 minutes.",
    "Submerge all of the cut potatoes in the water to prevent them from turning brown while some of the starch washes off.",
    "While you wait, start preparing the other ingredients.",
    "If you have more time, soak the potatoes for longer to make crispier fries.",
    "Set the bowl in the refrigerator to keep the water cold.",
    "You can prepare the potatoes in advance and leave them for up to 24 hours.",
    "Preheat the oven to 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C).",
    "Keep the oven around this temperature so the fries crisp up without burning.",
    "Oven fries take longer to make than those done in oil, so keep this in mind when choosing your tools.",
    "Baking the potatoes gives you a little more freedom when seasoning.",
    "It allows you to add different spices, herbs, and other ingredients directly to the fries before they go into the oven instead of relying on a heavy batter.",
    "Toss the potatoes with olive oil and seasonings.",
    "Place the potatoes in a mixing bowl, followed by \u20444 cup (59 mL) of olive oil.",
    "Add in 3 cloves of minced garlic, \u00bd teaspoon (2.15 g) ground thyme, and \u00bc teaspoon (1.42 g) of seasoned salt.",
    "Mix the ingredients together by hand until the potatoes are evenly coating.",
    "For a mess-free way of seasoning, add all the ingredients to a resealable plastic bag.",
    "Shake the plastic bag to season the potatoes.",
    "Garlic powder can be used in place of fresh garlic.",
    "Start with about \u00be teaspoon (2.33 g) and add more as needed.",
    "For a simple seasoning, sprinkle the fries with the salt and \u00bd teaspoon (0.90 g) of black pepper.",
    "Alternatively, add 2 teaspoons (4.60 g) of smoked paprika, \u00bd teaspoon (2.60 g) of cumin, and even some chili powder for a unique flavor.",
    "Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking tray.",
    "Set a piece of parchment paper on the tray to prevent the potatoes from sticking.",
    "Spread the fries out as much as possible.",
    "If you're short on space, letting them touch a little is fine.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a piece of parchment paper, coat the baking tray with a nonstick cooking spray.",
    "Bake the potatoes for 30 minutes in the oven.",
    "Keep in mind that the baking time will change depending on your oven and the thickness of the fries.",
    "Thicker fries will take a little longer to crisp up.",
    "Remove the fries to finish seasoning them.",
    "This is an average cooking time for garlic parmesan fries.",
    "If you don\u2019t plan on melting cheese or adding more herbs, you don\u2019t need to take the fries out.",
    "Instead, consider flipping the fries over after 20 minutes to ensure they cook through evenly.",
    "Cover the fries with cheese, then bake them for 10 minutes.",
    "Take the fries out of the oven and put them back in the mixing bowl.",
    "Sprinkle \u00bd cup (75.0 g) of grated Parmesan cheese over them, followed by \u00bc cup (5.0 g) of chopped parsley.",
    "Mix the ingredients together, move the fries back to the baking tray, and bake them until they turn a golden brown color.",
    "Add additional seasoning as desired after the fries finish.",
    "Try sprinkling on another \u00bc cup (40.0 g) of Parmesan cheese and \u00bc teaspoon (1.42 g) of seasoned salt.",
    "Making Home Fries Wash and slice potatoes up into small cubes.",
    "Rinse 3 Russet potatoes under cold water, then use a kitchen scrub brush to remove any dirt still on them.",
    "You do not need to peel the potatoes, but use a potato peeler if you wish to do so.",
    "Then, slice up the potatoes with a chef\u2019s knife to cubes about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide.",
    "The skin will crisp up as you cook the potatoes in the pan, so you don\u2019t need to remove it.",
    "Boil the potatoes if you wish to reduce the cooking time.",
    "Place the potatoes in a pot, then fill it with enough cold water to cover them completely.",
    "Add 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) of salt before turning your stove to a high heat setting.",
    "Wait for the water to boil, then let the potatoes cook for an extra minute.",
    "Parboiling is a way to make fries with soft insides.",
    "The potatoes are done when you are able to piece them easily with a fork.",
    "Overcooked potatoes will be mushy and fall apart.",
    "If you don\u2019t wish to boil the potatoes, fry them in a heated pan.",
    "You still season them the same way and get quality fries.",
    "Drain the potatoes and let them cool for 5 minutes.",
    "Pour the pot\u2019s contents into a colander, then shake it to remove excess moisture from the potatoes.",
    "Set the colander aside as you prepare to cook them on the stove.",
    "Heat butter and olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.",
    "Combine about 2 tablespoons (28.4 g) of butter with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil.",
    "Wait for the butter to melt and the oil to begin shimmering.",
    "Cook the potatoes for 5 minutes until they start to brown.",
    "Move the potatoes into the hot pan first.",
    "Keep them in a single layer so they all cook evenly.",
    "After about 5 minutes, check the bottom edges for a consistent brown coloring.",
    "The cooking time may vary depending on your stove\u2019s settings and how the potatoes were cut.",
    "Add the onions and paprika, then cook them for 10 minutes.",
    "Add half of an onion after chopping it up roughly.",
    "Sprinkle the onions with \u00bd teaspoon (1.05 g) of paprika, then flip the potatoes over so the uncooked side is against the pan.",
    "Stir the potatoes after 5 minutes and continue cooking them until they look brown and smell delicious.",
    "The best time to begin seasoning the potatoes is right when you begin frying them.",
    "That way, the flavors blend in well with the potatoes and onions.",
    "You don\u2019t need to use onions, garlic, or other ingredients if you don\u2019t want them.",
    "Consider making simple home fries with salt and pepper, for instance.",
    "Another option is to cook the onions in a separate pan, ensuring they reach the right consistency.",
    "Combine them with the potatoes right before serving them.",
    "Chop and mash garlic and other seasonings together.",
    "For garlic home fries, chop up 1 clove of garlic and place it in a separate mixing bowl.",
    "Place \u00bc cup (8.0 g) of chopped parsley on top of it, followed by 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) of salt.",
    "Mash them all together to complete the seasoning.",
    "Change the seasoning mixture to suit your tastes.",
    "Try using garlic powder in place of fresh garlic or adding cayenne pepper, black pepper, and oregano.",
    "Stir the seasoning mixture into the potatoes and cook them for another 2 minutes.",
    "Add the seasoning, making sure the potatoes are well-coated.",
    "Let the potatoes continue to cook for about 2 minutes so the garlic has time to heat up.",
    "Then, take the potatoes out of the pan and eat them while they\u2019re warm.",
    "If you cooked the onions separately, add them now along with other herbs and spices."
