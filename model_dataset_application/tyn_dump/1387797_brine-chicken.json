    "This helps the chicken stay moist and gets the skin nice and crispy.",
    "Use a baster or a cooking brush to reapply the liquid from the pan on the chicken.",
    "Try not to leave the oven open for too long as you work -- this causes the heat to drop too quickly and slows cooking.",
    "Cook the chicken for 45 minutes, or until a meat thermometer in the breast reads 150\u00b0F.",
    "Breast meat is best at this temperature, and thigh meat needs to be 170\u00b0F to be safe.",
    "If the outsides start to darken before the insides are fully cooked, lower the oven temperature to 450\u00b0F.",
    "Let the chicken stand before cutting into it.",
    "You need to let the chicken rest, otherwise all the juice will leave the meat when you cut into it.",
    "Set the chicken aside on a cutting board and tent it loosely with aluminum foil.",
    "After 5-6 minutes, you can remove the foil, cut into the chicken, and start eating."
