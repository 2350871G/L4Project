While in the refrigerator, the syrup will thicken considerably as it cools off. Leave the syrup in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Add additional flavorings to the lemon-simple syrup before it cools completely while resting in the pan. Consider adding \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of rose water or \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of vanilla extract to reduce the tangy taste of the lemon. Leave the syrup as is if you want a stronger, lemony flavor. If you are not planning to make the kunafa dough the same day as the simple syrup, add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of corn syrup before placing it in the refrigerator to maintain the smoothness of the simple syrup. The syrup will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week."
