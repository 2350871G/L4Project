Make sure the pot is heavy, solid, and light-colored so you can monitor the caramelization process. If you plan on adding cream to your caramel, be sure the pot you choose can accommodate the caramel's expansion. Any impurities in your pot or on your cooking utensil (spoon, spatula) can cause an unwanted reaction called recrystallization. Recrystallization is a chemical process by which impurities and a compound (sugar) are dissolved in a solvent (water) and either the impurities or the compound can be coaxed out of the solution, leaving the other behind. For our purposes, this means the formation of awful sugar clumps."

Most clumps will melt during cooking. To prohibit recrystallization, you can keep the pot covered until the sugar is completely melted. Any sugar crystals hanging on to the sides of the pot will be forced to the bottom by the condensation created. Another trick to prevent recrystallization is to add a tiny amount (a drop or two) of lemon juice or cream of tartar to the sugar water mix right at the moment it begins to dissolve. These recrystallization \"agents\" prevents large crystal lumps from forming by coating the smaller crystals. Some people also use a pastry brush dipped in water to wipe any sugar crystals off the sides of the pot during the heating process.
