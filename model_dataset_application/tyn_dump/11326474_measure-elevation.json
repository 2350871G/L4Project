If you\u2019re working near a bridge or nearby building, try to determine the elevation of those locations by looking at a past land survey. For example, if you\u2019re measuring the elevation between 2 different points in your yard, try using the elevation of your house as a benchmark."

Next, take 2 metal posts and insert them into the marked areas of soil. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions when you install the posts, and check to see if you need to dig any post holes ahead of time.

If you\u2019re using the Imperial measurement system, divide this number by 12 to view the results in feet. If you\u2019re using the metric system, adjust the decimal point accordingly. For example, if the distance between your posts is 132 inches (340 cm), divide that length by your the length of your 4 ft (120 cm) level to get a total of 33 in (84 cm). If the distance between your posts is 2 in (5.1 cm), multiply 33 in (84 cm) by 2 in (5.1 cm), which gives you a total of 66 in (170 cm).
