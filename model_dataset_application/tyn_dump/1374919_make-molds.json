Add least 1 inch (2.54 cm) to each of your object's measurements before marking cut lines on your box. You'll need the extra space for the mass of the mold. Out of foam core board, cut 2 walls for the width and 2 walls for the length, keeping in mind the object's height. Cut 1 square (width measurement by length measurement) for the floor piece. Make a box by gluing the 4 walls together and then to the floor section with super glue. Again, if this isn't airtight, it won't do the job."

This prevents any of your moldmaking compounds from leaking. You may want to stay away from Insta-Mold and stick to modeling clay. For a 2-part mold, layer the bottom of the mold box with clay and push the object into the clay, leaving 1/2 of its height exposed for molding. Once you feel you have submerged the lower portion of your object to its approximate half-mark, smooth the top surface of the clay as much as possible before moving on to the next step to make a mold."

Create a new box to make a mold in, this time to the existing mold's length and width, allowing enough space in the height to pour the second part of the mold on top.
