  "text":" Preparing the Filling Combine all of the filling ingredients except the water chestnuts. Add 2 pounds (907 g) of large peeled and deveined shrimp, 1 pound (454 g) of ground pork, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of toasted sesame oil, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (8 g) of cornstarch, 3 tablespoons (11 g) of fresh ginger that\u2019s been peeled and grated, 5 smashed cloves garlic, 4 chopped green onions, 4 egg whites, the juice from one lemon, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste in a food processor. Pulse the ingredients until they\u2019re smooth. You\u2019ll likely need to pulse the ingredients 3 to 5 times to get the right texture. It should be slightly chunky, not completely pureed. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and fold in the water chestnuts. Once the filling mixture is smooth, use a spatula to transfer it to a medium bowl. Add a 4-ounce (115 g) can of water chestnuts that have been minced to the bowl, and gently fold them in. Make a small patty with the filling to test the seasoning. When the water chestnuts are incorporated, use clean hands to form a small patty with the filling. You should use approximately 2 tablespoons (17 g) to make the patty. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of canola oil in pan and add the patty. Place a small saute pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes, and then place the patty made of the filling in the oil. Cook the patty until it\u2019s browned and drain on paper towel. With the patty in the oil, allow it to cook until it\u2019s browned on the first side, which should take 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the patty over, and cook it for another 2 to 3 minutes or until both sides are browned. Taste the patty to determine if the filling is seasoned properly. Once the patty is finished cooking, transfer it from the pan to a paper towel-lined plate to drain for a minute. Next, taste the patty to see if you like the filling\u2019s seasoning. If necessary, mix in some more salt and pepper. You can mix in more of any other seasonings that you feel are lacking as well. For example, you might add a little more ginger or garlic if you want those flavors to be stronger. If you decide to add more seasonings to the dumpling filling, it's a good idea to make a second patty for tasting to ensure you're happy with the flavors. Filling the Wonton Wrappers Brush the edges of a wonton wrapper with water. For the shumai, you\u2019ll need a 10-ounce (284 g) package of wonton wrappers. Unwrap the wontons and cover them with a damp paper towel to keep them from drying out. Next, lift a wrapper from the pile and use a pastry brush to wet the edges with water. If you prefer, you can use a beaten egg to dampen the edges of the wonton wrappers. The egg is stickier, which can help the wrappers stay closed. However, it's easy to over-saturate the edges with egg so they don't stay closed as well. Using water typically offers more control. Form a cup with the wrapper in your hand. Make a circle with your thumb and forefinger and lay the wrapper on top. Press down gently so the dough forms a cup shape in your hand. Add some of the filling to the center and pat it down. Place 2 teaspoons (6 g) of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Use the back of the spoon to gently press down the filling. Squeeze the wrapper around the filling. If any of the wrapper\u2019s edges are overhanging, fold them up around the filling. Press the wrapper around the filling to ensure that it\u2019s secure, though the filling should be exposed at the top. Tap the top and bottom of the dumpling so it\u2019s flat. When the shumai is secure, tap the bottom of it against a plate, countertop, or other work surface to flatten it. Use the back of a spoon to flatten the top of the dumpling as well. If you like, you can add some frozen peas and/or carrots to the top of the shumai as a topping when you\u2019re finished shaping them. Repeat the process until all of the shumai are filled. After you\u2019ve filled the first dumpling, set it down on a clean plate. Continue shaping and filling all of the dumplings until you\u2019ve used up all of the wonton wrappers. Steaming the Shumai Line a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves. To cook the shumai, you need a bamboo steamer. Lay several leaves of napa cabbage in the bottom of the steamer to line it. You can substitute lettuce for the cabbage if you prefer. Two to three leaves is usually enough to line the steamer. If you don't have a bamboo steamer, you can substitute a metal steamer basket. In addition to lining it with the cabbage leaves, though, it's a good idea to mist it with baking spray first to ensure that none of the dumplings stick if there are any gaps in the leaves. Bring some water to a boil in a large pan. Add 1- to 2-inches (2.5- to 5-cm) of water to a large, wide pan. Place it on the stove over high heat, and allow the water to come to a boil, which should take about 3 to 5 minutes. Place the steamer over the pan and add the shumai. When the water has come to a boil, set the steamer over the pan. Use tongs to place the dumplings into the steamer, and cover the steamer with its lid. Make sure the water doesn\u2019t touch the bottom of the steamer. However, you may need to add more water to the pan as it evaporates during the steaming process. Depending on how large the steamer is, you may need to cook the shumai in batches. Steam the dumplings until they\u2019re cooked through. Once the shumai is in the steamer, reduce the heat to medium. Allow the dumplings to cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until they are cooked through. Serving the Shumai Mix the chile paste and light soy sauce together.
