You also have the option to use a mat which will place a border overtop of the photograph. If you choose a mounting board with a border, carefully choose what color you want to show taking into account whether or not it matches the photograph.

Cut the tissue slightly smaller than the photo, about 1/8 inch (3 mm) smaller than the print on all sides, so the edges aren't visible beneath it. Using an acid-free dry mount tissue is recommended as an acid-based tissue might cause visible damage to your mounted photos in the years to come."
