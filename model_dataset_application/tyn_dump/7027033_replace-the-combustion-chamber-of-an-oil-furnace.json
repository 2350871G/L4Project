      "description":"Most oil burners have a service switch on or near the boiler (or furnace) itself, designed specifically for service personnel to ensure the power remains off while they are working on the equipment. If unable to locate the service switch, shut off power one way or another (circuit breaker, firomatic, etc.) to prevent furnace from starting. Place a note on the electrical panel explaining the the circuit is off because the furnace is being serviced. Professionals typically employ \"Lock Out / Tag Out\" by affixing a handle lock and tag on the breaker or panel cover while they are working on the equipment. Test to verify power is off before continuing. Shut off fuel supply (often found at the outlet of the tank)."

This will help you to remember how to reconnect the lines and cables later. If the fuel line must be removed, also be sure to shut off the oil supply valve at or just before the point of disconnect. Many times, the easiest point and method to disconnect is by unbolting the fuel pump cover from the furnace motor itself. Gently move it out of the way, while trying not to move the fuel lines any more than necessary. This minimizes the chances of kinking lines or disrupting the mating surfaces between flared ends of the lines and compression fittings.
