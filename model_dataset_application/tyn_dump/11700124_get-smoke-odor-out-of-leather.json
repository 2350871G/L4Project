Fill a bag or open container with cat litter and place it near the leather item. After a couple days, the smoke odor should be gone! If the smoke smell is still lingering after several days, dump out the used cat litter and replace it with fresh cat litter. Purchase cat litter from your local pet supply store or big box store."

If you have a smaller item that smells or you\u2019d rather not apply the baking soda directly to the leather, fill a plastic or paper bag with baking soda and place the bag on or in the leather item. Leave the bag filled with baking soda on or in the leather item for at least 1-2 days so it has time to properly absorb the smell. For example, place a bag of baking soda in a purse or wrapped in a leather jacket."

Over time, the charcoal will absorb the smoke odor so the leather smells fresh again. If you\u2019re trying to get rid of a smoke odor in your car with leather interior, place the bowl or bag of charcoal in the car and leave it in there for at least 2 days."

Wrap smaller leather items in the newspaper and let them sit for several days so the newspaper has time to soak up the odor. If you have larger items, try placing several sheets of newspaper overtop the leather, covering up as much of it with newspaper as possible.

Vinegar is a natural cleaner and shouldn\u2019t damage your leather, but if you\u2019d rather not apply it directly to the leather, fill a bowl with vinegar and place the bowl next to the leather instead."

Avoid leaving your leather out for more than 5 or 6 hours, as the sunlight can dry out the leather if it\u2019s exposed for too long. Try leaving your leather item outside for several hours each day, bringing it inside before it starts to dry out too much or receive a lot of direct sunlight."
