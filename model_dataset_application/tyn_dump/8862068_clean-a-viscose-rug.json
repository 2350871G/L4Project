Instead, use a non-electrical rug or carpet sweeper and run it along the direction of the rug's nap or pile. This should lift up any remaining crumbs or dirt stuck in the rug. You can go over the rug several times if it's still dirty. You can find an inexpensive carpet sweeper at many department stores or online. If you don't have a carpet sweeper, you can use a soft broom, such as a window washing broom or hand broom. Keep in mind that viscose is not a strong material. It won't hold up well if you vacuum it often or put it in a high traffic area. When you need to clean it, don't scrub very hard or overwork the fibers."

If there is a larger area that you need to clean, mild dish soap and water is a good solution. Saturate a rag with cold water and a drop of pH neutral dish soap, then rub the rag in the direction of the nap. When you're done, blot over the area with a dry rag until it's dry. Do not use detergents because they can stain and alter the color in your rug."

For especially tough stains, try spot cleaning the area with a mixture of water, white vinegar, and mild dish soap. Mix the solution together and skim the bubbles on the top of the solution with a rag. Use the rag with the bubbles on it to wipe down the stain then immediately remove the solution with a clean, damp rag. Do not oversaturate the rag in the solution or you may damage your rug. As an alternative to a vinegar solution, a citric acid solution will also treat stains. Since water can yellow your viscose fibers, you might prefer to use a specialized citric acid solution that won't yellow your viscose. You can also spray a fabric softener on the rug after spot cleaning it to keep it soft. When you use fabric softener, put it in a spray bottle, then dilute it with water. Spray a little bit of fabric softener onto the rug. Next, use a soft bristle brush to hand groom the rug, brushing it in the direction of the grain."
