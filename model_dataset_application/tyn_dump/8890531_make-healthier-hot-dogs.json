Pulse the meats until they\u2019ve got an extremely fine texture. If your food processor isn\u2019t that big, try grinding the meats separately. Then throw them into the processor together just to mix them."

      "description":"When you\u2019re done grinding the meats, add the oats and 2 large, lightly beaten egg whites, 1 tablespoon (10 g) of garlic powder, 1 tablespoon (7 g) of onion powder, 4 teaspoons (8 g) of ground dry mustard, 1 \u00bd teaspoons (2 g) of dried thyme, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground mace, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground sweet paprika, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, and 1 \u00bd teaspoons (3 g) of freshly ground black pepper. Run the mixture in the processor until you've got a thick paste. You don't want to run the food processor for too long because it can get hot and heat the meat. Pulse it briefly, and cool processor down for a couple of seconds before pulsing it again."

Next, roll the ball into a log that's about 5-inches (13-cm) long to give it a standard hot dog shape. If you want totally traditional hot dogs, you can run the meat mixture through a sausage maker with hot dog-sized casings. But be aware that you'll have healthier hot dogs without casings."
