Silicone caulk maintains its integrity in sunlight and extreme temperatures better than latex caulk and it also lasts longer under most circumstances.

Caulk, especially silicone caulk, adheres better to a surface that is slightly rough and uneven than it does to a perfectly smooth surface. The gutters do not need to be jagged, but it helps if the metal is a little coarse. Cut the tip of the caulk tube at an angle. Do not cut the tip off straight across. Cutting the tip at an angle makes it easier to fit the tube into the seam. Fix the caulk tube into a caulk gun. The tube should be fitted securely at both ends of the gun. Apply the caulk in a straight, small bead across the seam. Start at the front of the seam and gradually pull the trigger of the caulking gun. As you squeeze, a small dot of caulk should emerge from the nozzle. Drag the nozzle down the length of the seam, applying even pressure on the trigger to maintain the same size dot along the entire seam. Push the caulk into the joint with a screwdriver. After you have applied the caulk, work it under the joint with the tip of a screwdriver. By working it into the joint, you ensure a stronger seal. Apply another line of caulk. Draw a second line of caulk above the first using the same method and amount of pressure as you used to create the first. Do not push this line under the joint. Smooth the caulk with your finger. Use your finger to smooth the beaded line into a smooth strip of caulk. The width should be even throughout the entire line. Allow the caulk to dry. After it has dried, check your work to verify that the caulk is secured.",
