Either way, nails that are sticking up above the wood floor present both a danger and a nuisance. Most of the time, hammering the nails down deeper into the flooring is a better and easier solution than taking the nails out. Hammer the nails down about \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) into the floor. Use a nail set so you don't leave hammer marks(dents)in the wood. Work with their direction, not against it. Once the nails are \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) deep, they're ready to be concealed with a little bit of filler that you'll make after sanding down the rest of the flooring. More on that later."

You can rent floor sanding machines at hardware supply stores or equipment rental stores. Start with a semi-coarse grit and begin to sand the floor. Start off gently. You don't want to gouge the floor. If you get a good sander, you'll even be able to lift up the sander and spend a little more time on heavy-wear or problem areas. Change out your sanding disks as necessary. You may need to change out the sandpaper once or twice using the same grit before you've completely removed the finish. Using a pencil, color the entire area lightly with streaks of graphite. This will help tell you when you've sanded an area. Otherwise, it'll be tough to tell where you've sanded and where you haven't. Go over the entire floor again with a medium-grit sandpaper. Look at the pencil streaks to determine whether you've already sanded an area or not. Again, you may need to change the disks on your sanding machine before the job is finished."
