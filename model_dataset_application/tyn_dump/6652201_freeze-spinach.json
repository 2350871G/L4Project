    "If your freezer stays at 0\u00b0F, the spinach will stay safe to eat as long as it's frozen.",
    "However, the quality will be best if you eat it within 10-12 months.",
    "To thaw the spinach, place it in the refrigerator overnight.",
    "If you'll be using the spinach in a frozen smoothie, there's no need to thaw it first.",
    "Just toss it into the blender along with\u2014or in place of\u2014your ice cubes.",
    "You can also add frozen cubes of spinach directly to hot soups or other dishes while you're simmering them, since the heat will quickly melt the ice."
