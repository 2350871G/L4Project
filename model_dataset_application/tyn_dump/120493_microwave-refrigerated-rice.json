  "text":" Using a Paper Towel Put the rice on a plate. Unless you have a specific need to use a bowl, a plate allows the rice more surface area on which to be heated. It will allow the moisture added to reach more of the rice. Use a fork to break up any clumps of rice. If you must use a bowl, try and have it be as shallow as possible. Dampen a paper towel. Take a paper towel and soak it in lukewarm water. Make sure to use a large enough paper towel to cover the area of the plate you're using. Once damp, carefully ring out the towel (avoid tearing) enough so that it's still damp, but not dripping water. Place the towel over the rice. Lay the damp paper towel flat over the top of the rice. Pat down the paper towel so that it makes contact with the topmost layer of rice. Press it into the rice along the edges of the plate, and fold the towel's edges over the bottom of the plate. Try and make the best seal you can as you're essentially creating a steam chamber for the rice. Microwave the rice on low. If you have the time it's best to microwave your rice on a lower power setting to avoid drying out the rice. A longer microwave time will allow the moisture more time to enter the refrigerated rice. Though all microwaves differ, an ideal time and power level would be 4 minutes using 50% or 60% power. At the very least try 2 minutes on 80 percent power. Let the rice stand. Again, provided you're not in a hurry it's best to let the rice stay covered in the microwave for a minute or so. This both helps to cool down the rice and allow more time for the moisture to reach the rice. Once done, remove the paper towel and enjoy your rice. Using a Cup of Water Fill a microwave-safe cup. Using any micro-wave safe cup, fill about 2/3 of it with warm water. If you have no paper towels on hand, including a cup of water in the microwave along with the rice is an alternative way of adding moisture into the microwaving process. As the water heats, it releases steam at least some of which will return to your rice as added moisture (much how rice is cooked in the first place). Microwave the cup for one minute. Before adding the rice, heat the water in the microwave for a minute (or until you see it boil) to prime it for use with the rice. Keep a napkin or cloth towel nearby, as water may spill over the edge. If this is too much of a problem, pour some water out of the cup. Microwave the rice and water on lower power levels. Using power levels as suggest above, put your rice into the microwave with the heated water. Remember to keep them separate; have them on opposite sides of the rotating microwave dish.

It may require more time if still dry to the touch. Once complete, dispose of the water carefully as it may still be near-boiling.",
