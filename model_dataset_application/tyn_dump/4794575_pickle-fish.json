          "description":"While you can pickle full fish or large fillets, you won't get the same control over the process that you do when you cut up the fish. If your fish is freshly caught, clean and gut it first. Then, use a sharp, clean knife to cut your fish into large chunks before you start the brining process. The chunks should be about the size of a large bite of food. You want to be able to eat them, but you don't want them to be so small that they dissolve during the pickling process. For smaller fish like anchovies or herring, you may be able to pickle the whole filet without cutting it up."

Make a weak brine by adding 1 cup of kosher salt or sea salt per every quart of water (about 200 grams per every liter of water), and bringing the solution to a boil. Let the salt dissolve before removing it from the heat. Then, allow the brine to cool. You will need enough brine to completely cover your fish."

Rinsing helps get rid of some of the salty flavor from the brine. If you do rinse, pat the fish dry completely. If you don't rinse, you should still pat the fish to absorb any excess salt."

After you've removed the brine and patted dry your fish, cover it with 5% acidity distilled white vinegar. Put the fish back in the refrigerator and allow it to sit for at least overnight and up to a full day. Once your fish is ready for pickling, drain the vinegar, but don't rinse off the fish. Other fish that may benefit from a vinegar soak include mackerel, sardines, and anchovies."
