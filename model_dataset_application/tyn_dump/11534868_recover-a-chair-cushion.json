          "description":"You can remove the old fabric or simply cover it with your new fabric. Remove all of the staples with a flathead screwdriver or staple remover. Slide your screwdriver under the staple and move the handle up to pop each staple off. If you\u2019re using a staple remover, wrap the jaws around each staple and pull it off. Pry every staple out and pull the fabric cover up to remove it. If you notice that the interior cushion is made out of loose stuffing, consider simply covering over the old fabric to make things easier. If you do want to replace the stuffing, buy a foam pad for a cushion online or at a local craft store. You can also buy loose cotton stuffing and pat it down while you wrap the fabric around it. You can use a staple removing tool if you prefer, but the staples that go into cushions tend to be a little too strong for a standard staple remover. You don\u2019t need to remove the old cover if you don\u2019t want to. You can always add a new layer of fabric on top of your old cushion."

Carefully pull the upholstery off by ripping it off of the glue or internal staples. If it is stapled into the frame under the foam padding, use a screwdriver, utility knife, or angled scraper to remove the staples. This step can be kind of messy since it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s keeping your cushion in place. There may be internal staples or glue that you simply can\u2019t see. If you think you\u2019re going to destroy the cushion by removing the old upholstery, recover your cushion by adding fabric on top of the old cover. If you\u2019re only adding a new cover over your old upholstery, skip this step."

Add 4\u20138 in (10\u201320 cm) to each side to ensure that you have enough room to fold the cushion over the padding. If the old cover wasn\u2019t destroyed when you removed it, you measure it on a flat surface to determine how much fabric you need.Tip: It\u2019s better to have too much fabric than too little.

Use a fabric marker or fabric chalk to sketch the dimensions where you\u2019re going to cut the cushion out. You can use a permanent marker if you don\u2019t have a fabric marker. You\u2019re going to tuck the edges under the seat so nobody should see any excess marks you make. If your new fabric has a pattern, make sure that the pattern lines up with the edges so that it looks even and direction that you want. For circular cushions, place the cushion in the center of your fabric, then, trace around the outside of the seat, leaving an extra 4\u20138 in (10\u201320 cm) on each side."

If you\u2019re using a rotary cutter, feel free to use a straight edge to keep your cuts clean. They don\u2019t need to be immaculate, though.

Grab a staple gun and staple the center before applying more staples to the left and right of the center. Leave the last 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) near the edge unstapled. This way you\u2019ll be able to fold the corners over when you\u2019re done. For a round cushion, pinch the fabric together while pulling it over the edge of the cushion so that it stays tight. Start by completing roughly 1/4 of your fabric on any side. Place 1 staple every 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) along the rim of the cushion."

Then, work your way towards the edge, stapling as you go. At the corner, fold the excess fabric near the edge underneath itself like you\u2019re wrapping a birthday present. Lift the corner up and slide one side of the fabric underneath the corner as you lay it down over itself. Then, staple it into the frame on the adjacent side to conceal it under the seat. Repeat this process on the other side to finish stapling all 4 sides. Tuck each corner in towards the center of the seat so that it doesn\u2019t stick out on the sides. You can really fold your corners however you\u2019d like. So long as your excess fabric is concealed, it doesn\u2019t really matter how it is folded. With a round cushion, you may notice larger lengths of fabric remaining where your remaining sections meet the first 2 sides that you stapled. For these corners, pull the fabric a little tighter and layer the cloth on top of itself like an accordion. Place 2-3 extra staples along these sections where the fabric meets."

    "Use the same process to staple the other sides of your fabric.",
    "Start with the end on the opposite side from where you started.",
    "Pull the fabric in the center so that it is tight on top.",
    "Add 1 staple every 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) based on your preferences and leave the last 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) unstapled near the corners.",
    "You don\u2019t need to pull the fabric very hard to keep it tight.",
    "It\u2019s okay if there isn\u2019t a ton of tension in the fabric.",
    "Once you\u2019ve stapled 1/4 of a round cushion, go to the opposite side and staple that section.",
    "Pinch the fabric as you\u2019re folding it over the seat the same way you did on the opposite side.",
    "Fold your last 2 sides over, tucking your corners as you staple.",
    "With your 2 remaining sides, tuck each corner as you\u2019re stapling it into the cushion or chair.",
    "As you pull a side tight, staple the center.",
    "Then, work your way towards the edge, stapling as you go.",
    "At the corner, fold the excess fabric near the edge underneath itself like you\u2019re wrapping a birthday present.",
    "Lift the corner up and slide one side of the fabric underneath the corner as you lay it down over itself.",
    "Then, staple it into the frame on the adjacent side to conceal it under the seat.",
    "Repeat this process on the other side to finish stapling all 4 sides.",
    "Tuck each corner in towards the center of the seat so that it doesn\u2019t stick out on the sides.",
    "You can really fold your corners however you\u2019d like.",
    "So long as your excess fabric is concealed, it doesn\u2019t really matter how it is folded.",
    "With a round cushion, you may notice larger lengths of fabric remaining where your remaining sections meet the first 2 sides that you stapled.",
    "For these corners, pull the fabric a little tighter and layer the cloth on top of itself like an accordion.",
    "Place 2-3 extra staples along these sections where the fabric meets.",
    "Trim any excess fabric before reinstalling the seat.",
    "Use sewing scissors or a utility knife to trim any unnecessary fabric hanging out past your staples.",
    "Cut any loose threads and add staples as needed to secure the fabric to the seat.",
    "Then, reattach the cushion to the chair.",
    "Either screw the seat back into the chair or place wood glue along the top of the chair\u2019s frame before reattaching it.",
    "If the seat was stapled into the frame, use staples to reattach it.Tip: You can remove staples that you misplace with pliers or a flathead screwdriver."
