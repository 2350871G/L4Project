          "description":"Look in your basement or crawlspace for your sewer pipe. Follow the direction of the sewer pipe to identify the general location of your septic system. Go back outside and look around in that area to identify your septic tank. Find a pipe that you know is a drain, such as a pipe coming from a toilet or a sink, and follow it until it connects to a larger pipe. The larger pipe is your sewer pipe. Once you locate your septic tank, draw a map of its location so you can find it in the future."

          "description":"If your tank is buried underground, you'll need to expose the top of it so you can inspect and access it. Use a shovel to remove enough dirt to allow you to see the top of the tank and the manhole. Be careful not to drive the blade of the shovel into the septic system when you dig. Uncover the tank just enough to inspect it so you can bury it again when you're done so it isn't visible."

Serious damage will require an inspection and possibly repairs from a septic tank specialist. Lots of corrosion and rust could mean it's time for you to replace your tank."

Stand near the tank, have someone flush a toilet, and listen for the water traveling to the tank. If you see water bubbling through the ground or a crack in the system, your tank is in need of a repair from a septic tank specialist.Tip: If you don't have another person to flush a toilet while you stand near the tank, turn on a faucet then head outside to the tank to make sure the water is reaching the tank properly."

Use a saw or a pipe cutter to remove a small section from the larger pipe. PVC pipe is relatively cheap and can be found at home improvement stores and online.

    "They could help them when they pump the septic system.",
    "You can also compare your measurements to theirs to make sure they're being honest.",
    "Keep records of any work performed on your septic system.",
    "Anytime you have a professional work on or pump your septic system, keep the records in a safe place.",
    "They can come in handy later if you need to see what work was done or if your septic tank is damaged.",
    "Keep your records in a file cabinet so you know where they are.",
    "Keeping Your Septic System Healthy Install high-efficiency toilets to reduce water use.",
    "Toilets can account for up to 30 percent of your household water usage.",
