  "text":" Cutting Apart LED Strips Measure out the length of LEDs you need. The LEDs come in 1 long strip. You can cut off individual LEDs when you need them, but they have to be cut at specific points to work properly. Determine how long your LED strip needs to be before cutting off any lights. Find the cut line on the LED\u2019s copper dots. Look for a pair of copper dots on the back of the LED strip. The copper dots indicate where each light connects to the next one on the strip. You will see a dotted cut line running between the copper dots. Choose the line closest to the LED length you measured earlier. The line is the only place you can safely cut the LEDs. If you cut anywhere else, some of the LEDs won\u2019t work. Cut the LED strip apart with scissors. A pair of scissors will do the job. Hold the lights still and cut along the dotted line. You should be cutting between the copper dots. Line up the cut carefully to avoid damaging the LEDs. Securing LEDs to a Quick Connector Align the quick connector with the LED strip. Quick connectors can be purchased along with LED lights and are hassle-free ways of completing the electrical circuit. The LED will have a + and - printed on the back. Line up the connector\u2019s black wire with the - and the red wire with the +. Pull the plastic bar \u20448 in (0.32 cm) off of the quick connector. Hold the connector in 1 hand. Find the small plastic bar, usually colored black, at the end. Pull this bar forward to open the connector. Be careful, as the connector is delicate.
