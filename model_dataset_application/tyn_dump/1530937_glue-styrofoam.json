Consider testing the glue on an inconspicuous area first. If the glue does not say whether or not it is safe to use on Styrofoam, you might want to test it first. Some aerosol-based products, such as spray paint, can actually melt or dissolve Styrofoam.

Because of their precision, hot glue guns are great for attaching small Styrofoam objects together. They are also great for Styrofoam balls. Though the fumes that result from burning Styrofoam aren't likely to immediately hurt you, they're not something to treat lightly, as they can contain a variety of toxic chemicals.
