The fresher and fattier the salmon, the better your gravlax will taste, so choose the highest quality salmon possible. Check the salmon's labeling. Look for sustainably-sourced salmon that was not previously frozen. It's easier to find this while salmon is in season during the summer months. Salmon that has been frozen and thawed will not taste as good after curing. To make enough for eight servings, get a two-pound salmon filet with the skin still attached. The flesh should be bright orangish-pink and firm. The skin should look bright and shiny, not spotted or damage. Buy the salmon the same day you're planning to start the curing process, if possible. Store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it."

Using vodka, bourbon, rye or another alcohol is not traditional when it comes to the lox you'd get in a deli for your bagel, but it can add a lot of depth during the curing process. If you wish to use alcohol, you'll only need a few tablespoons, enough to rub over the entire filet before you coat it in the cure."

Sugar, spices and citrus zest may be added to provide extra flavor. Start with a basic cure the first time you cure salmon, then consider getting creative and adding your favorite spices and alcohol for a different flair the next time around. Use the following ratio of ingredients for one two-pound piece of salmon:\n1/2 cup kosher salt (not table salt, which can negatively affect the flavor)\n3 tablespoons white sugar\n3 tablespoons of the fresh chopped herbs of your choice, like oregano, dill, basil, fennel or a combination\n1/2 tablespoon white pepper\nOptional: 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) lemon zest"
