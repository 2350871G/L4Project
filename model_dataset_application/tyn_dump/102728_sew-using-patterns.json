Remember, it will not necessarily be the same size as the ready-to-wear clothing you already own, as pattern sizing can vary considerably from what you're used to wearing.

          "description":"All patterns contain an allowance for fit, known as \"fit or wearing ease\", or \"designer ease\", assuming they are designed for fabrics that require this allowance. The allowance is not included for garments designed for knit fabrics since these fabrics have natural stretch. Read the instructions on your pattern to find the allowance or look on the pattern itself for \"finished\" measurements, or something similar. Compare the difference between the finished measurements and your body measurements in order to find the allowance. If you don't want the allowance that is included, or if you want to make it smaller or larger, you'll need to look out for this. This allowance will determine what the final size is for the garment, and indicates whether the garment will fit loosely or closely. Some companies have a standard allowance that corresponds to the descriptions (loose-fitting, fitted, etc.). For beginners it is probably better to ignore all of this, as you may not be ready to alter patterns. If you're unsure, leave in the allowance and take the final garment to a tailor."

Sewing patterns tend to dull scissors and sharp scissors are needed to easily cut fabric. If you slip and make a cut where you shouldn't have, simply tape it back into place as best you can.

The term \"nap\" refers to the up-and-down nature of a print (namely, could the design be cut upside down by accident?). Pin the pattern pieces to the fabric following the user guide. Usually you will pin the pieces together using 5/8\" (15mm) seam allowance. However, make sure you double-check the seam allowance in the pattern because not all patterns use 5/8\" (15mm). You can also use pattern weights so you won't damage fine or delicate fabric with the needles. You will now have half of the garment.

    "You will cut the fabric using the solid line on the pattern pieces as a guide.",
    "Use a pair of scissors specifically earmarked for cutting out paper sewing patterns.",
    "Keep another pair of 8\" (20.3cm) long scissors specifically earmarked for cutting out fabric.",
    "Sewing patterns tend to dull scissors and sharp scissors are needed to easily cut fabric.",
    "If you slip and make a cut where you shouldn't have, simply tape it back into place as best you can.",
    "The important thing is that the shape is retained and that you can still read the markings.",
    "You can transfer the final cut-out pattern onto card-stock or cardboard if you want a stiffer pattern to use.",
    "Lay out the patterns according to the user guide.",
    "The user guide will contain a fabric layout guide for each of the items in the pattern pack.",
    "The layouts can vary according to which fabric widths you've chosen and whether the fabric is \"with nap\" or not.",
    "The term \"nap\" refers to the up-and-down nature of a print (namely, could the design be cut upside down by accident?).",
    "Pin the pattern pieces to the fabric following the user guide.",
    "Usually you will pin the pieces together using 5/8\" (15mm) seam allowance.",
    "However, make sure you double-check the seam allowance in the pattern because not all patterns use 5/8\" (15mm).",
    "You can also use pattern weights so you won't damage fine or delicate fabric with the needles.",
    "You will now have half of the garment.",
    "Have a friend check the fit and help you make any needed alterations in size or length.",
    "Mark and cut the pattern.",
    "Mark the pattern using tailor's chalk or a tracing wheel and tracing paper.",
    "You can also make tape labels for the back of each pattern piece so you won't get confused when you start to sew and don't know what you are looking at.",
    "Other Considerations Choose a simple pattern for a first-time sewing project.",
    "The less complicated, the easier it is to learn how to use the pattern.",
    "Always read the description on the pattern packaging when deciding whether or not the pattern interests you; it will contain guidance on the item, including suggestions for wearing or use.",
    "In addition to the overall description, the details about the garment or item are often on the back of the pattern envelope and will help guide you on fit and style.",
    "Check to make sure you like the item.",
    "On the pattern you buy you should find an image of the completed item.",
    "Most patterns will include a photograph of the completed garment or item on the front of the pattern, with illustrations on the back.",
    "If there are variations such as different sleeve lengths, different styles, different collars, etc., the images will usually show these.",
    "When trying to get an idea of how a finished garment will look, refer to the photographs over drawings, as they're more realistic.",
    "Check the pattern's difficulty level.",
    "On the package, there should be some indicator of difficulty level.",
    "Some pattern companies give an indication of the suitability from beginner to advanced.",
    "Trust this estimation and don't bite off more than you can chew.",
    "Avoid lined garments.",
    "Don't try anything that needs to be lined with another fabric; that's too advanced for the beginner.",
    "Start with simple pieces like A-line skirts or basic tops, and work on things like this until you are very comfortable with your skills.",
    "Choose the required fabric and supplies.",
    "On the back of the pattern, you'll be instructed as to which fabric will suit the sewing project.",
    "You will note that some patterns suggest a range of fabric types, as well as warnings for fabrics that are not suitable.",
    "This gives you leeway to purchase fabric that you like, or that's within budget, etc., as well as forewarning you that you will may have a bad experience if you try to use fabric not suited for the pattern in question!",
    "The amount of fabric will also be noted; this is important as it gives you an indication of the cost if you need to buy it, or can help you to decide whether you've enough fabric at home already.",
    "Make sure to get all sewing notions.",
    "These are the extras required to complete the pattern, such as zips, buttons, embellishments, etc.",
    "The size, length, and number of such notions is usually made clear.",
    "Be smart about fabric usage.",
    "Once you're more comfortable using patterns, you'll want to find smarter ways to lay out your pattern and cut the fabric.",
    "You can save a lot of money this way, as patterns can often be more than a little generous.",
    "Don't worry about this in the beginning though, as you will not have the skills to judge where to cut right away.",
    "Getting Extra Help Learn to use a sewing machine.",
    "A sewing machine will be much easier and can be crucial for sewing some patterns.",
    "Learn to hand-stitch.",
    "Hand sewing is also a good skill to have and can make some patterns or parts of patterns easier to sew, if you can build the skill.",
    "Sew button holes.",
    "Learning to sew buttonholes can be a very useful sewing skill.",
    "Make a nice seam.",
    "Making a professional-looking seam is also an important sewing skill.",
    "Alter your clothes.",
    "Learning how to alter patterns and existing clothes will also be necessary to learn over time."

    "Straight pins \u2013 for a simple project, one box of pins should be enough. Straight pins are always used in sewing so you can never have too many. Pins with pearl heads or plastic ball heads are best, and easiest to see if you drop them on the carpet.  Don't work barefoot, at least not as a beginner!",
    "Pincushion and container to store the pins. A magnetic \"pincushion\" is very handy. (Remember that magnets can damage your computer and demagnetize the magnetic strip on credit or debit cards, so keep such a cushion away from your sensitive electronics.) Most sewers keep some pins in their pincushion but store the bulk of pins in a container with a lid, a box, empty breath-mint tin, etc.",
    "Tailor's chalk or a tracing wheel and dressmaker's colored carbon paper to mark the fabric for darts etc. The dressmaker's carbon paper will be near the tracing wheels at the fabric store.  ",
    "Never",
    " use office-type carbon paper, as it will not wash out.",
    "Tape measure to make measurements of body sizes and to check the pattern. A ruler is useful (but not mandatory) if you need to lengthen or shorten the pattern.",
    "Paper scissors and fabric shears - note: quite a few sewers use the same pair of scissors/shears for fabric and tissue patterns. But the scissors are reserved ",
    "only",
    " for fabric and tissue patterns \u2013 not for gift wrap, craft projects, trimming hair \u2013 ",
    " for fabric and tissue patterns. Alternatively, splash out and keep separate scissors for the pattern tissue, for the fabric, and for your other craft projects (label them!).",
    "Large, smooth, snag-free cutting surface (clean floors are okay).  Large kitchen tables and ping-pong tables work fine, too, so long as you can lay the fabric out. If you use a carpeted floor, you'll need to slide cardboard underneath the fabric, or you'll end up pinning everything to the carpet. Carpet also harbors a lot of fluff, animal fur, and dust, so be cautious and ensure it's very clean before laying fabric on it.",
    "Colored pen to mark alterations on the paper pattern. Scotch tape to \"take in\" paper pattern, and make alterations to fit, although it's easier to just pin the alteration, instead of taping it."
