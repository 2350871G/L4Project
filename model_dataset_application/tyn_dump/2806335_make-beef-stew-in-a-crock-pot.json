The beef should be cut into 1-in (2.5-cm) cubes. You can usually find pre-cut beef stew meat in the butcher's department at the grocery store, but if not, you can trim and cut a chuck roast or bottom round cut. The garlic clove should be minced. If using pre-minced garlic, use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml). If using garlic powder, use 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml). The onion and celery should be roughly chopped. You can use 3 large baking potatoes or 6 to 9 baby potatoes. Use 4 standard carrots or 2 cups (500 ml) baby carrots."
