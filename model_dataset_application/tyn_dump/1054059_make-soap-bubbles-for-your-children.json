Some soaps make bubbles that last longer than others, so experiment with different types until you find one you like. Simply mix one part liquid soap and 4 parts water in a jar, cup or bowl. Try these different types of soaps:\nLiquid dish soap. This makes a great bubble base, and it's something you probably already have on hand. Body wash or shampoo. These may not be quite as sudsy as liquid dish soap, but they should still work fine for making bubbles. All natural laundry detergent. Stay away from commercially-produced detergent, which may not be safe for kids to use. Chemical-free laundry detergent can be found at health food stores."

This causes the bubbles to be a little thicker, which results in longer-lasting bubbles. Add some food coloring. You can separate the solution into a few different containers and make different colored bubbles. Add some fun decorative ingredients. Have your kids find out whether you can make bubbles with glitter, small flower petals, and other tiny ingredients. Which ones make the bubbles pop?"

Bend the top section of a pipe cleaner into a circle shape, then bend the tip of the circle around the shaft of the pipe cleaner to create a wand. If you have old egg-dying supplies lying around, you can use the circular egg dipper as a wand. Bend a straw into a wand shape, and fasten the circular part with a piece of tape."

You'll need a large wand shape with a piece of mesh or screen to cover it; this helps stabilize the solution so the bubble can form without popping. Straighten out a wire coat hanger. You may need a pair of pliers to untwist the top of the wire.

Slowly lift the wand from the solution and check to make sure a membrane of swirling bubble solution is stretched across the blower. Gently wave the bubble maker through the air; a large bubble will form and separate from the wire. Try running with the giant bubble blower to make a larger bubble.
