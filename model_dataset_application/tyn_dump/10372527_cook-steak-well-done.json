New York strip and rib-eye, in particular, are known for having a good distribution of fat throughout the meat. An 8\u201312 oz (230\u2013340 g) steak is a good size for a single portion. If you live in the U.S., USDA Prime is the best cut of meat available, and indicates rich marbling. If you can't afford that or it's not available, USDA Choice is the next best, followed by USDA Select."

          "description":"You\u2019ll get a more even cook on your steak if you start with one that\u2019s room-temperature. Take the steak out of the package and place it in a dish on the counter for about 20-30 minutes so it can start to warm up. The steak may release some of its juices as it warms, so place it on the counter in a rimmed baking dish. You should never allow raw meat to sit at room temperature for too long, as it can start to spoil. Keep a close eye on the time while you're bringing your steaks up to room temperature and do not exceed 30 minutes."

          "description":"If you have a gas grill, only turn on one of the burners. If it\u2019s a single-burner grill, you can just turn down the temperature after you flip the steaks. If you\u2019re using charcoal, group the hot coals to one side of the grill. If you hold your hand 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) over the hot side of the grill, you should only be able to leave it there for about 2 seconds before it's too hot. While you want the high heat to get a great sear on the outside of your steak, you can\u2019t cook it on high heat the whole time, or the outside will finish cooking faster than the inside. To avoid this, focus the heat on one side of your grill, so you\u2019ll have a cooler zone to transfer the steaks to after they sear."

          "description":"The vegetable oil will help keep the steaks from sticking to the grill. Be sure to cover both sides in a light coat of the oil. You might not need to use all of the oil for smaller steaks. On the other hand, for very large steaks, you may need to use a little more."

Since the seasoning needs to reach all the way into the steak, it\u2019s best to use a liberal amount, although the exact measurement will vary depending on the size of your steak and your personal taste."

However, don\u2019t be tempted to move the steak around too much. It\u2019s best to leave the steak where it is so it can get a good sear. Searing may help hold in the steak's juices, resulting in a more tender well-done steak. Don't crowd the grill too much; there should be at least 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) between the steaks. After 4 or 5 minutes, the steak should be golden brown and slightly charred. If you want diagonal grill marks, you can rotate the steak 45\u00b0 once during the sear, but otherwise, leave it alone."

Whenever you\u2019re cooking steaks, you should always use tongs. This is because tongs won't pierce the meat, so the steaks will be able to retain more of their juices as they cook."

If you want to be sure the steak is done, use a meat thermometer and remove the steak from the grill when it reaches 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). The temp for a well-done steak is 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C).

When you\u2019re cooking a steak to well-done, it\u2019s especially important to let the juices settle, since the longer cooking time has a tendency to dry out the meat."

    "Marbling means you can see fat running throughout the meat, which will give you a juicier steak.",
    "You can use any cut of steak for this, but New York strips, rib-eyes, Porterhouses, and T-bones are popular choices for grilling.",
    "Choose a steak that's about 8\u201312 oz (230\u2013340 g) for a single serving.",
    "Coat the steak with a layer of salt about 30 minutes before you cook it.",
    "The exact amount of salt you\u2019ll use will vary depending on the size of your steak, but it\u2019s fine to be generous with the salt.",
    "Much of it will be absorbed into the steak while it\u2019s resting.",
    "Leave the salted steak at room temperature for 20-30 minutes before you cook it.",
    "In addition to seasoning your steak, the salt creates a dry surface on the steak that helps create a beautiful crust when you sear it.",
    "Do not leave your steak at room temperature for longer than 30 minutes, or you'll risk the growth of dangerous food-borne bacteria.",
    "Preheat your oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C).",
    "The best way to ensure you get a thorough cook on your steak is to sear it in a skillet, then place the skillet in a hot oven so the steak can finish cooking.",
    "This way, the outside won\u2019t burn as you bring it up to temperature.",
    "Heat 1 \u20442 US tbsp (22 ml) of vegetable oil in an iron skillet over high heat.",
    "On most stovetops, this will only take about 2-3 minutes.",
    "When the skillet gets hot enough, the oil should start to smoke just a little.",
    "Keep an eye on it to ensure the oil doesn\u2019t get scorched; otherwise, you\u2019ll have to throw it out and start over.",
    "Vegetable oil is a good option for this because of its high smoke point and neutral flavor.",
    "If you use another oil, make sure it\u2019s not one that will burn at a high temperature.",
    "Canola oil, grapeseed oil, and peanut oil are all also good for cooking at high temps.",
    "If you don't have an iron skillet, use another heavy-duty skillet that\u2019s safe to put into the oven.",
    "Alternately, you could sear the steaks in a skillet, then transfer them to an oven-safe dish to finish cooking.",
    "Place the steak in the skillet and sear it for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Once the oil is smoking, use a pair of tongs to carefully place the steaks in the skillet.",
    "Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan, though\u2014if you\u2019re cooking more than 1 steak at a time, the steaks shouldn\u2019t touch each other in the pan.",
    "If you need to, cook the steak in batches.",
    "After the 2-3 minutes are up, the steak should be lightly browned and shouldn\u2019t stick to the pan when you flip it.",
    "Searing one side of the steak like this may help hold in the juices, resulting in a more tender steak.",
    "Flip the steak with your tongs and sear the other side for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Tongs are ideal for flipping a steak because they don\u2019t pierce the meat.",
    "Using a fork to flip the steak will create holes that allow the juice to come out, which will dry out your steak.",
    "A spatula can tear the crust off the bottom of the steak if it\u2019s not ready to release from the pan.",
    "Add 2-3 tbsp (30-45 g) of butter to the pan after you flip it.",
    "The butter will add moisture to the steak as it cooks, resulting in a tender and juicy steak that\u2019s still cooked all the way through.",
    "If you like, you can add herbs and aromatics to the pan along with the butter.",
    "Thyme is a popular addition to pan-seared steak.",
    "Just drop 1-2 sprigs in when you add the butter, then remove the stems before you serve the steak.",
    "Spoon the butter over the steak for the next 2 minutes.",
    "As the steak finishes searing on the stove, use a large spoon to continuously baste the steak with the butter.",
    "Not only will this help cover the steak completely, but it will also keep the butter from burning as it melts over the high heat.",
    "If you need to, you can tilt the pan to make it easier to pick up the butter with the spoon.",
    "Place the steak in the oven for about 12 minutes.",
    "The exact cooking time will depend on the size and thickness of the steaks.",
    "After about 12 minutes, check the temperature of the thickest part of the biggest steak.",
    "If the temperature reads 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), take the steaks out of the oven.",
    "Otherwise, put them back in and check them every 1-2 minutes until they\u2019re ready.",
    "To ensure the steak is cooked to your likeness, go by temperature, not time.",
    "This will ensure a more consistent result.",
    "Use a potholder to transfer the skillet, since the handle will probably be hot.",
    "Let the steak rest for about 5 minutes, then slice and serve it.",
    "At high temperatures, the juices inside of a piece of meat tend to shrink toward the center.",
    "When you let a steak rest after cooking, all the juices are redistributed, resulting in a more tender steak."
