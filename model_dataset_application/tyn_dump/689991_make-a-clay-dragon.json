          "description":"Of course, to form your clay dragon you'll need clay, but there are many options to choose from. For the purposes of sculpting an amateur mini-dragon, you might consider using Sculpey\u00ae, Souffle\u00ae, or Premo\u00ae polymer clay. If you plan on giving your dragon some color or highlighting its features, like it's eyes and wings, you'll also want a spray paint primer and some paint for your hardened clay. Acrylic paints are recommended by many clay artists for painting baked polymer clay. Aluminum knitting needles are also useful tools for styling and adding details to your clay dragon. Finer needles can be used for finer detail designs, like the features of your dragon's face."

To limber your clay and ready it for sculpting, you'll want to tear it into pieces and knead it in your hands. Your hands will warm your clay, softening it and making it easier to work with. Sculpting clay is intended to be worked with in this fashion. The size of the dragon you intend to make will determine how much clay you use. However, a surprisingly small amount of clay goes a long way, and you can always add more clay if necessary."

          "description":"From your central ball of clay you are going to pull out your dragon's limbs. Do this by pinching out four legs at regular intervals without separating it from your clay ball. Flatten the limbs and bottom of your ball to create a solid base. Thick legs will create a more solid shape and will prevent your dragon's limbs from breaking free of its body. Feel free to adjust limbs as needed. For example, you may need to push the legs a little more closely together or pull more clay from your clay ball to give the limbs stability."

Make sure the base of your dragon's neck is thick enough to support the head and the length of the neck. A stout, short neck can be easier to accomplish for beginner level sculptors. At the end of your neck, you can fold down the end of the clay to form a head. Dragons typically have serpentine features, so the head of your dragon will likely be triangular in shape, ending in a point."

Avoid making your tail too long, as this can crack during backing or harden in a way that is brittle and delicate. Push down slightly on the base of your tail to give the effect that the tail is coming out from between the dragon's legs, and not from the top of your clay ball, which will eventually turn into the back of your dragon."

          "headline":"Create wings for your dragon.",
          "description":"Wings can be tricky, and while learning the basics of sculpting you may want to keep your wings thick and small. Create your wings by pulling some clay from either side of the top of your clay ball. If you find that you need more clay, knead a small piece and use your thumb to blend the new clay with that of your clay ball, and then work this clay into the simple shape of a wing on both sides. Thick wings will keep the clay from cracking there when you bake it and will result in a sturdier sculpture. The wings, being such a delicate part of the sculpture, are the most fragile and breakable part of the dragon. Exercise care while forming these."

          "description":"Your dragon may be a hornless variety, but if you had planned on making a horned dragon, take a small amount of surplus clay and knead it in your hands. Then, shape two cones for your horns and lightly press each into the head of your dragon. Use a little water to dampen the base of your cones. This can help keep your horns in place."

This can be done by:\nKneading some extra clay. Pulling off little pieces. Rolling tiny cones, damping the base of the cones, and pressing the cones along the spine of the dragon. Adding a contour line with your knitting needles to either side of the spine."

Using your finest knitting needle, you should carefully:\nTrace a line along the inside of the outer boundary of your wing. Add lines from the top of the wing to the bottom of the wing, splitting each into regular sections. Avoid thinning your wings too much or applying too much pressure. Thin clay cracks easily when baked or after being baked, and even well formed wings will be delicate."

This is usually done in a kiln, but your polymer clay can be baked in your oven. Check the temperature at which your clay should be baked as listed on the label or instructions your clay came with. Pre-heat your oven first. Putting your clay in the oven before it is at the target heat can have a negative impact on the firing process. Watch the dragon while it is baking.
