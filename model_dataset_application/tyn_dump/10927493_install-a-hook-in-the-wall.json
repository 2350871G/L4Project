Stud finders are small handheld machines that can detect the wood behind your walls. Hold the stud finder against the wall and press the button to turn it on. Move the stud finder across your wall and wait for it to beep. Mark the location of your stud on the wall with a pencil so you know where to put your hook. Studs are commonly 16 inches (41 cm) apart from one another, but your home\u2019s architecture may be different. If you don\u2019t have a stud finder, you can also try knocking on your walls. Knocking on a stud will produce a full, solid sound while knocking on an area without one will sound hollow."

Once you drill through the wall, speed up the drill so it can dig into the wooden stud. Make your hole the same depth as your screw so it can hold securely. You don\u2019t have to pre-drill holes if you don\u2019t want to, but it can prevent your walls from chipping and your studs from splitting.

If the hook uses nails, slide the end of the nail through the hole and place the end of the nail against the mark you drew on the wall.
