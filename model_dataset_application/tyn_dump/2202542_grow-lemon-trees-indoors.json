They produce plenty of small or medium fruits and their maintenance level is more friendly for beginners. Pink variegated lemon trees also grow well indoors and are beginner-friendly. Buy a lemon tree at least 2-3 years old, as young trees may not grow as well indoors.

Look for a plastic pot with plenty of depth to help your tree balance as it gets larger and produces fruits. The pot depth determines how large the lemon plant can grow. About 15 gallons (57 L) is the minimum recommended pot size. Choose a pot that has drainage holes to prevent your plant from getting waterlogged."

The water-filled saucer will help maintain a trace amount of humidity around your tree. You can cut a strip of landscaper's cloth and place it at the bottom of the pot to keep it from leaking dirt into the saucer.
