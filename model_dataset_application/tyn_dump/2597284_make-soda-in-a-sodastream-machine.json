Carbonating Your Water Fill up the carbonating bottle with cold water to the fill line. Your soda machine comes with a clear plastic bottle. Fill up your bottle with cold water, either from the tap or from a filter, to the fill line. Using cold water allows you to drink your soda right away without having to chill it first. Snap or screw the bottle into the machine. Depending on which model of SodaStream that you have, you will either snap the bottle into the bottle lock or screw it into the bottle lock. To screw it in, turn it 3 times in a clockwise position. To snap it in, simply push the top of the bottle in place. Push the bottle into a vertical position. Once it is locked in, gently push the bottle into a vertical position so that it is upright. There will be a gap between the base of the machine and the bottom of the bottle. Press down the carbonating block or button in short bursts. Depending on your model of SodaStream, either press down on the entire top block of your machine or press a small black button to start the carbonation process. Press down in short bursts, taking a 1 second break in between each press. Watch the LED lights that indicate how carbonated your water is. Your soda machine has 3 levels of carbonation. The first one is light fizz, the second is medium fizz, and the third is strong fizz. As you add carbonation, the LED lights will light up to indicate the levels. Decide how carbonated you want the water to be and stop pressing the button once it reaches that level. You may have to try multiple levels of carbonation before you find the one that you like the most. Pull the bottle of water out of the lock mechanism. Once you\u2019ve added carbonation to your water, you can pull the bottle out of your machine\u2019s lock mechanism. Depending on your model of SodaStream, either twist the bottle or pull it out toward you to unlock it. Flavoring Your Carbonated Water Hold your bottle at a 15 degree angle and pour a capful of SodaMix in it. Choose which flavor of soda you\u2019d like to put in your carbonated water. You can purchase different kinds of SodaMix online or anywhere that you buy SodaStream products to replicate many different flavors of soda. Holding the bottle at an angle makes it less likely to overflow as you pour. Popular flavors of SodaMix include peach tea, cola, and lemon lime.
