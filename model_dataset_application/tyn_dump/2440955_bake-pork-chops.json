  "text":" Preparing the Pork Chops Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).  Begin heating the oil in a medium to large skillet over medium heat.  Rinse the pork chops and pat them dry with a paper towel.  Set out 3 shallow bowls or dishes. Combine the flour and seasonings in 1 bowl. Put the beaten eggs into another bowl. Pour the bread crumbs into the 3rd bowl. (Line the 3 bowls up on your counter top left to right)\nDredge (coat) the pork chops in the seasoned flour. Dip the coated pork chops in the egg. Coat the chops with the bread crumbs. Be sure to thoroughly cover each chop with the crumbs. Browning and Baking the Pork Chops Raise the heat to medium high under the skillet. The chops will brown faster and the quick searing will help seal in the juices. Brown the coated pork chops in the skillet until they are crispy. (About 5 minutes on each side.) Transfer the chops to a 9x13\u201d (23 x 33 cm) oven proof baking dish.  Arrange the chops so that they are not overlapping or touching each other.  Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. (This will keep the chops from burning as well as keep them moist.) Bake for 1 hour.  Preparing the Cream Sauce Combine the soup, milk and wine in a medium bowl.  Whisk together the sauce ingredients until the mixture is smooth and lump-free.  Remove the baking dish from the oven and remove the foil covering.  Pour the cream sauce over the chops so that all 6 chops are evenly coated.  Replace the foil and return the chops to the oven.  Continue baking for another 30 minutes. ",
