Using a dry brush is most effective if the efflorescence is only in small patches. It's good to avoid water if you can help it, since water is what causes efflorescence."

          "headline":"Use water and mild detergent to scrub the surface of the brick.",
          "description":"For exterior walls, use a garden hose to spray the efflorescence with water. For interior surfaces, use a spray bottle filled with water to wet the surface. Then, use a stiff brush and mild dish detergent to scrub away the powder. Rinse the soap off with fresh water. Once the brick is dry, check to see if the efflorescence is gone. If it isn't, you may need to repeat this or try a stronger cleaning solution. When treating an outdoor wall, make sure the temperatures will be above freezing all day."

          "headline":"Spray a solution of vinegar and water on the brick and scrub it with a brush.",
          "description":"Mix equal parts of water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the surface and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then, spray the bricks with the mixture again and use a stiff brush to scrub away the efflorescence. Scrub in small, circular motions before rinsing the surface with fresh water. Vinegar can be abrasive on old bricks. Use a different solution if your bricks are  more than 20 years old. You can neutralize the acidity of vinegar by mixing a solution of 2-3 tablespoons (30-45g) of baking soda with a spray bottle full of water. Spray the solution onto the bricks you treated with vinegar."

Presoak the wall with fresh water, then apply the acid mixture using a brush. Let the mixture soak into the brick for about 5 minutes. Then, rinse the brick surface with plain water. Wear rubber gloves, safety goggles, and a respirator when working with acid. When mixing the solution, always pour acid into water, never water into acid."
