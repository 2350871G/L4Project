If you\u2019re just starting out, a quick sketch might be difficult to complete before the train leaves. In this situation, snap a picture with your phone.

When the paint dries, you can paint over it with a new design to continue practicing. If you\u2019re self-conscious about your practice, choose an out-of-sight wall, like one in your basement or behind your house.

Some tags may be unreadable, but a legible tag will help people identify your work more easily. Tags may change slightly over time, but generally they stay consistent.
