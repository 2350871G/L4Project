  "text":" Set Up Choose a card that you want to make disappear. For instance, the Ace of Spades. Place it somewhere, such as inside your wallet. Get a duplicate card and place that card on the bottom of the deck.  You need to place a piece of sellotape/scotch tape. Fold it and put it on the top of the deck such that the tape acts as double sided sticky tape. Trick Ask a spectator to pick 5 cards randomly from the middle of the deck making sure that the sellotape on the top of the deck is out of sight for the whole trick.  Say that you are going to add another card (the bottom card which you know, is the Ace of Spaces) to the 5 previous cards.  Align these 6 cards into 2 rows of 3 making sure you keep an eye on the bottom card (the card you chose).  Ask the audience to pick a row if they pick the row with the card discard the other, but if they pick the row with the ace of spade discard the other row.  Ask the audience to pick two cards, if one of the two is the forcing card (the ace of spades), then keep those two and ask the audience to pick another card, if they pick the ace of spades, then give it to them. If they do not pick the ace of spades discard the other card, so that they are left with the ace of spades. However if they do not choose a pair with the ace of spades,  then discard those two leaving the ace for the audience.  Ask the audience to look at their chosen card and then to give it to you, next you place it on top of the deck and the sellotape meaning that the forced card is stuck to the previous top card meaning that you only see one card giving the illusion that the card has disappeared.  Shuffle the cards, you could ask the audience to shuffle them. It makes no difference the card should still be stuck to the back of another card. Here you say that this trick never fails and say that their card will be the next card, turn it over and surprisingly it is not their card. Keep doing as many times as you want this, to make it seems as though the trick has failed luring the audience into a false sense of security. But then you pull out the duplicate ace of spades from wherever you had put it before e.g. your wallet.",
