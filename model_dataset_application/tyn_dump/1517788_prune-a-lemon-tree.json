      "description":"Lemon trees are evergreen trees that do not demonstrate a true dormancy, such as the loss of leaves. However, the growth and metabolism of the trees slow down after the fruit harvest. Lemon trees in cooler climates show slower activity just before the rapid spring growth. Pruning should occur during this period of dormancy or right when the new spring growth appears.

In 2007 and 2008, Steve taught the Local Sustainable Agriculture Field Practicum at Stanford University. Steve Masley\t\t\tOrganic Vegetable Gardener\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: It's best to prune lemon trees in the early spring before new growth has started. That way, as the growing season starts, the tree will redirect growth into the branches you've kept. If you prune in other times of year, the plant has already committed resources to the branches you're cutting, so it's more stressful. Also, pruning can often stimulate new growth, so if you prune going into the winter, that new growth is likely to be damaged by a hard frost."

They often surpass the height of the main plant in a couple of months if left unchecked, \"sucking\" the nutrients from the bearing part of the tree. Suckers that are green and newly formed can be gently broken off at the base. Suckers with woody stems should be cut with pruning shears flush with the trunk of the lemon tree."
