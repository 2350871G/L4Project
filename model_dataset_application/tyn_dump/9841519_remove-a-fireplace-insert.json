Remember to use your legs to bear most of the weight when you're lifting something heavy. Maintain the natural curve of your back and try not to twist your torso to avoid injuring your back.

A thick piece of carpet will help you slide the insert across your floor more easily as you move it, and it will also protect your floor from being damaged. The carpet should be at least 5 foot (1.5 m) longer and wider than the insert so you can easily grab the edges when you're moving the insert. To ensure it protects the floor, it should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. If you don't have an old scrap of carpet handy, try piling up some old pillows or thick blankets on the floor.
