These polishes will be versatile and easy to use, so if all you\u2019re looking for is a nice shine then these will get the job done. Be sure to purchase a formula made specifically for the project you're working on. If you are looking for something more advanced, look into using linseed or tung oil, shellac, varnishes, or lacquers. But be aware that varnishes, lacquers, and some mixtures of oils emit toxic fumes and will require extra safety precautions. For polishing laminate floors, purchase a product specifically formulated for this purpose. Other types of polish won\u2019t adhere to the laminate. Do not use food oils as polish, such as olive or vegetable oil. These will spoil and develop a rancid smell over time. Only use wax over non-oil polishes, such as shellac or lacquer."

This includes tables, chairs, beds- anything touching the floor. You won\u2019t be able to treat the floors properly if there is anything obstructing your way.

You can use either a professional-grade wood cleaner or a mixture of hot water and dish soap to wipe down the furniture and floors. For furniture, briskly wipe down the surface with a damp microfiber cloth before drying with a dry microfiber cloth. For floors, sweep the area with a broom or wood-safe vacuum and then mop. For all types of wood projects, always work parallel to the grain of the wood whenever possible. Microfiber cloths are much softer than standard wash cloths and less likely to damage the wood. It is important to dry the wood quickly as water can damage it. You can also spray the entire area with a floor cleaning solution before mopping if the floor is particularly dirty."

This is a great way to see if your furniture or floors have a layer of laminate that will prevent the polish from sticking to the surface."
