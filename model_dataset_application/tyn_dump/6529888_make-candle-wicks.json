          "headline":"Dissolve the salt and Borax.",
          "description":"Pour the hot water into a glass bowl. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt and 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of Borax. Stir to dissolve. You'll use this Borax solution to treat the base wick material. Treating wicks with Borax can make the candles burn brighter and longer. Moreover, it can also reduce the amount of ash and smoke produced by the burning process. Keep Borax away from children and pets since it can have a toxic effect when ingested or inhaled."

          "headline":"Soak the twine in the solution.",
          "description":"Take a piece of heavy cotton butcher's twine and submerge it in the Borax solution. Allow the twine to soak for 24 hours. Make sure that the length of twine used is longer than the height of the container you plan to use for your candle. If you don't know how tall the candle will be, you can soak up to 1 foot (30.5 cm) of twine and trim it down to size later. Butcher's twine is a great base material for candle wicks, but nearly any thick cotton cord should work well enough. You can use embroidery cotton, torn pieces of cotton cloth, or a clean shoelace with the plastic cap removed. Soaking the twine for 24 hours will produce the best results. You can technically remove the twine after 20 minutes, but the results will not be as ideal."

If you don't have a double boiler, you can use a clean metal can and a small saucepan. Heat 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water in the saucepan over your stove, letting it simmer and steam without boiling. Place the metal can inside the hot water. Wait another minute for the can to heat up before adding the wax. Melted wax can cause serious burns, so handle it very carefully throughout the rest of the procedure."

Use the thin balsa wood strips you'd typically find at a craft store. These sticks should be 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches (1.25 to 3.75 cm) wide. If you don't have a container in mind and don't know how large the candle will be, trim the wood down to a length between 6 and 12 inches (15.25 and 30.5 cm). You can trim away any excess later, so it's better to have too much than too little."

          "description":"Place the trimmed balsa wood into a shallow dish. Pour enough room temperature olive oil into the dish to completely cover the wood. While wood is flammable on its own, coating the wood in oil will allow the fire to catch quicker and burn more evenly. Olive oil burns cleanly, making it a great choice for candle-making projects. Let the wood soak up the oil for at least 20 minutes. You can wait up to one hour, if desired, so that the wood can absorb more oil and burn with an even brighter flame."

Instead of rubbing the stick dry, you could place it on a plate covered with paper towels and allow it to air dry for several minutes. When ready, the wood should still feel damp and slightly oily to the touch, but it should no longer leave an oily residue on your hands when you handle it."

Using wooden wicks instead of cotton ones will add a wooded scent to the candle as it burns, and wooden wicks may also make the occasional crackling sound as the fire consumes them."

You can use fresh wax or bits of old, recycled candles. Break it into small chunks so that it melts quicker. If you don't have a double boiler, insert a metal can or metal bowl into heavy saucepan and surround it with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water.

After cutting the pipe cleaner, use needle-nose pliers to carefully twist the upright portion of the wick toward the center of the circle. This portion should still remain upright, but it needs to be fairly centered. If the upright portion of the wick is too heavy or off-centered, the distribution of weight won't be balanced and the wick may topple over instead of standing straight."
