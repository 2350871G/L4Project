Using a Jig Secure the jig to your work station. Pocket hole jigs have holes in the base so you can easily screw them into your work surface. Place a screw in each of the holes and use an electric screwdriver to secure the jig to your table. If you don\u2019t want to damage your work surface by screwing in the jig, secure the back of it to the edge of the table using a hand clamp.

Double check the wood\u2019s actual thickness since it may vary from board to board. Adjust the collar on the drill bit so the end is \u20448 in (0.32 cm) off the jig. The collar is a band of metal that comes on each stepped drill bit so you don\u2019t drill too far through the wood. Use a hex wrench to loosen the bolt on the collar and slide it towards the drill. Slide the drill bit through one of the guide holes until it\u2019s \u20448 in (0.32 cm) from the bottom of the jig. Tighten the collar in place so it doesn\u2019t move. Clamp the wooden board into the jig. Set the end of the wood you\u2019re drilling in the jig so it\u2019s flush against the slide with the guide holes.

As soon as the bit is out from the guide, release the trigger and let the drill slow to a stop. Use the other guide hole to make a second pocket hole. Go to the hole closest to the other side of your wood, and feed the drill bit into the guide. Pull the trigger and push the drill through the wood until the collar stops it. Pull the drill back out before releasing the trigger. Make sure the drill is up to full speed before making your second hole. Always use at least 2 pocket holes to make your joint.
