          "description":"Lay out 2 floor joists parallel on the ground. Space 5 joists 16 inches (41 cm) apart so they lay perpendicular on top of the first 2 joists with their narrow side facing up. Use a nail gun to secure the side of each joist to the floor joist beneath it by firing at an angle through the side of each joist. Nail 2 slightly longer joists into the flat exterior edges of your frame. A joist refers to any piece of wood that is used to support a structure in a building\u2019s frame. They are typically 2 in \u00d7 6 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 15.2 cm) or 2 in \u00d7 8 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 20.3 cm). The length and size of your joists and floor joist depends on how big you want your playhouse to be. A good size for a playhouse for toddlers is 76 inches (190 cm) in length and 96 inches (240 cm) in width."

Once you\u2019ve measured their heights and checked to make sure that they\u2019re level, nail them into the insides of the joists in the two corners of the floor frame. Repeat this process for the 2 shorter posts, but put these in the middle\u2014equidistant from one another and from the 2 taller posts. The 2 shorter posts will be the opening for your door.

Do this on both sides of your floor, so that each piece of wood has a total of 4 nails securing it to the floor, with 2 nails placed symmetrically on each end of every board. To cut fittings out of a joist, measure the size of each side that you need to cut and draw it on the joist with a framing square and carpentry pencil. Set the joist on two sawhorses and carefully remove the selected section with your power tool. Treated 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards are excellent for floorboards.
