  "text":" Washing Normal Clothing by Hand Consider buying or making an agitator. It's not difficult to wash a load of laundry without any tools, but it can be tedious. If you plan to wash all your laundry by hand, especially towels, jeans, and other heavy items of clothing, you may wish to use a handheld agitator, which is simply a plastic tool useful for pressing and moving the clothes.
