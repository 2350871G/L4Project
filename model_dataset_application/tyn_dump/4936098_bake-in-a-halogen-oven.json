          "description":"You can wrap foil over your baking dish if the recipe calls for it, but only do so if you can wrap the edges of the foil securely around the sides of the dish. Aluminum foil can help prevent food from browning too quickly. The fan inside of the halogen oven is very strong, however, and loose foil will be easily blown off. If the foil becomes loose, it could float around the inside of the machine and could damage the heating element."

          "description":"Set the temperature dial to the correct cooking temperature three to five minutes before placing the dish inside your halogen oven. Many recipes will not mention a preheating step since the halogen oven takes such a short amount of time to reach a high temperature. Nonetheless, preheating your oven will still produce the best results. Some machines have a preheat button. Pressing it will preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius) for six minutes. Other machines will require you to set your desired temperature to preheat them."

          "headline":"Put the dish in your halogen oven.",
          "description":"Carefully place the baking dish onto the lower rack of the halogen oven. Once the dish is securely inside, close the oven lid. Halogen ovens usually have a top rack and a bottom rack. Use the bottom rack for baking, roasting, defrosting, steaming, re-heating, and most other forms of cooking. Use the top rack for grilling, browning, or toasting. Leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) gap in between the bakeware and the sides, bottom, and top of the machine. Doing so will provide better air circulation and ensure proper heating."

Most halogen oven timers can be programmed for times up to 60 minutes. Note that the oven will turn off as soon as the timer setting has been reached. As a result, a halogen oven is less likely to overbake or burn food than a normal oven if that food is left inside a little longer than intended."

If the timer is already set, the power light should turn green and the oven should automatically turn on. Make sure that the lid is in position before turning on the machine. Usually, the machine will not work unless the safety handle is set in its down position. Removing the lid in the middle of the cooking process will usually stop the heater and the fan. To resume cooking, place the lid back on the machine and set the handle in the down position again."

If you do not have this tool or if you cannot use it to get a good grip on your bakeware, use a set of long-handled tongs. As with conventional ovens, the baking dish will be hot when you remove it. Wear oven mitts to protect your hands and wrists. Place the hot dish on a towel, cooling rack or other heat-resistant base after removing it from the halogen oven."
