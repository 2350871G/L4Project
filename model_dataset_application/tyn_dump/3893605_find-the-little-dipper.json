Streetlamps, porch lights, and other forms of electrical illumination give off ambient light, which can \u201cbleed\u201d into the night sky and make heavenly bodies hazy or even invisible.

          "description":"The position of the Little Dipper varies slightly based on the time of year. The star cluster is at its highest point in the sky from around late March to the end of September. Because of this, the warmer months tend to be the best time to turn your eyes skyward. The movement of the Earth plays a big part in the way stars appear from ground level. Since the planet rotates on an axis, your geographic location in relation to the Little Dipper will change with the seasons, making it look higher or lower. While it\u2019s technically possible to catch sight of the Little Dipper at any time of the year as long as you\u2019re in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s much harder in the fall and winter, when the formation \u201cdrops\u201d and is prone to getting lost in the horizon.Tip: When attempting to locate the Little Dipper, it can help to remember the old saying \u201cspring up and fall down.\u201d"

Astrology websites and digital star maps, for instance, can show you the formation's basic structure and position relative to other stars. If you'd rather hunt for it yourself, try downloading a star-finder app that offers a full 360-degree view of space, such as SkyView or Star Tracker. The Little Dipper and the North Star are features exclusive to the northern sky. Unfortunately, that means that none of these star patterns will be directly visible if you happen to be below the equator.

The northern sky is home to the Little Dipper, along with its major outlying stars: Polaris, Dubhe, Merak, Pherkad and Kochab. You'll be using these stars as guide markers to work your way toward the formation. Digital star maps and star-finder apps often include built-in compasses to help you establish your vantage point.

          "description":"Once you're facing north, gaze high up on the horizon or straight overhead to see if you can find Polaris. Polaris is the first and most brilliant star in the Little Dipper, which means that if you find it, you\u2019ve effectively found the Little Dipper, even if you can\u2019t make out its full shape. Consider buying or renting a telescope to \u201czoom in\u201d on the stars and simplify the process of locating the Little Dipper and other groupings and constellations. If a telescope is out of your price range, you might also invest in some binoculars. A strong pair of binoculars can increase your viewing power by up to 70%! If your goal is to find the Little Dipper, Polaris will be your biggest help, as it\u2019s the biggest and brightest star in the bunch. In order to identify Polaris, however, it may sometimes be necessary to first track down the Big Dipper.Tip: If you\u2019re equipped with a telescope or binoculars, the most effective strategy is to first narrow down the general vicinity of the Little Dipper with your naked eye, then pull out your viewing aid and use it to get a closer look."
