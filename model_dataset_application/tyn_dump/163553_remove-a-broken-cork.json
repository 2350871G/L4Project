If you have a towel, make sure to wrap the towel evenly so that the part of the bottle hitting your hard surface is as flat as possible.

If you have a screwdriver it could be useful here for inserting the screw without pushing the cork further down. If you notice the cork is being pushed down, stop. Try creating a small hole with the point of a knife for the screw to go into. Insert the screw until it is far enough into the cork so that it won\u2019t pop out.
