          "headline":"Choose a location to use as a studio.",
          "description":"You can shoot product photography almost anywhere, but you need to prepare the space so it functions as a studio. Look for a room that gets a lot of natural light if you\u2019re not planning to set up a lighting system. Make sure that the space is big enough for you to set up a studio. Use a room that has windows next to a wall so you can use natural lighting if you want to do so. If you choose to shoot outdoors, find a space that isn\u2019t too windy and doesn\u2019t have a lot of moving shadows."

        {
          "headline":"Use natural light for a softer light.",
          "description":"Natural light refers to sunlight and has a much softer range of light than artificial lighting. Some products benefit from being shot under natural lighting conditions. If a product is meant to be used outside, then use natural lighting. Products that are meant to be worn by a person like clothing or jewelry should be shot in natural lighting because people look better in natural light. To emphasize the setting of the product or it\u2019s surroundings, use natural light for a more authentic feel."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go with artificial lighting for more control over the lighting effect.",
          "description":"Artificial lighting includes light bulbs or even candles to produce a smaller but more focused light on the surface of the product. Use artificial lighting to highlight the details of a product. For example, if you wanted to sharpen the texture of a product like jewelry, artificial lighting can highlight the surface. Don\u2019t mix natural and artificial lighting or the photograph will look strange and unattractive.Tip: Use a 3 point lighting system for the best use of artificial light. Use a key light, a fill light, and a backlight to control the way the lights and shadows function in your photography."

          "description":"You don\u2019t want any other lights contaminating your studio. They can degrade the quality of the lighting and cast unsightly shadows and blemishes on the product that you\u2019re trying to shoot. If you aren\u2019t planning to use any natural lighting, close the blinds on the windows. Use blackout curtains to prevent any outdoor light pollution."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Set up a table to use as your shooting area.",
          "description":"Use a simple folding table to serve as a flat and stable surface to shoot your product photography. If you plan to use natural light, place the table close to the window without intersecting any shadows from the windowsill. The closer you are to the window and the larger the window is, the softer the natural lighting will be. Use a standard folding table that is about 24\u201327 inches (61\u201369 cm) wide so you have enough space to work with."

          "description":"A camera will pick up blemishes or discolorations in a white wall or wrinkles in a white backdrop. The best way to ensure that you capture a perfectly white background without corners or blemishes is to use a white sweep. Use a black sweep if you want a dark background for your photos. You can find sweeps at craft supply stores or online."

The camera quality and resolution is high and you don\u2019t have to invest in an expensive digital camera. If you don\u2019t own a smartphone with a camera, try to borrow one from a friend."

They have the ability to shoot manual, which means you can have more options and settings. DSLR cameras also allow you to use different lenses. Basic DSLR cameras cost around $500-$600."

They have more flexibility and options than a smartphone camera but are more limited in their ability to shoot high-quality product photography than DSLR cameras. They have different modes to choose from, better resolution than a smartphone camera, and often have a better zoom capability. A few popular options are the Nikon CoolPix and the Canon PowerShot. Point-and-shoot cameras cost about $200-$300."

It also makes the photo look more professional and appealing for marketing purposes. If your smartphone doesn\u2019t have a portrait mode, you can download an app like FabFocus, PortraitCam, or AfterFocus, which will create the portrait mode effect."

Play around with the lighting to create different shadows and effects.Tip: Try taking pictures of the product in different contexts. For example, if you\u2019re shooting a photo of a watch, take photos of the watch on a white sweep background. Then take photos of the watch being worn on the wrist of a real person in different poses. You can use the images for different purposes."

You\u2019ll notice that changing the filter will drastically alter the feel of the picture. Use a sepia filter to create an old-timey feeling in your image. Choose a filter that improves the saturation, or the intensity of color in the image. You can also raise the saturation to improve under-exposed images. Black and white filters can add a darker quality to your image.Tip: Use a filter that makes sense for the product. For example, if you\u2019re shooting a colorful bathing suit, use a filter that is fun and bright to complement the image."
