Most screen doors will be 78\u201380 inches (200\u2013200 cm) high and between 30.5 inches (77 cm) and 48.5 inches (123 cm) wide. Sliding screen doors are designed to be paired with sliding glass doors. If you don\u2019t already have a sliding glass door in your home, your first task will be to put one in in order to provide the proper frame and track for your screen door.Tip: If the rollers on the bottom track rest above the top of the rail, you may need to subtract as much as \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) to ensure that your new door will fit."

However, you can also find doors constructed of materials like steel and treated wood. One of these may complement the style of your home better than an ordinary aluminum door would. Keep in mind that buying doors made from sturdier or less common materials may drive up the amount of money you spend on your project. A heavier screen door isn\u2019t guaranteed to provide more protection from the elements. In fact, aluminum tends to be more resistant to rust and corrosion than many other metals."

If your glass door has been set up for right-handed use, the handle will be on the left side of the door frame. This orientation will be reversed for left-handed doors.

Using a Phillips-head screwdriver, turn each screw counterclockwise as far as it will go to disengage the expanders. Many newer sliding screen doors come with built-in expanders, which makes it possible to fine-tune a door\u2019s fit inside its frame following installation.
