  "text":" Making a Frisbee from Paper Plates Get out supplies. To make a frisbee you will need two paper plates, packing tape, scissors, and markers for decoration. Decorate your plates. Use markers to draw designs on the bottom of the plates. You don\u2019t need to decorate the side of the plate you put food on because it will become the inside of the frisbee. Tape the tops of the plates. Cover the side of the plate that you would place food on with clear packing or shipping tape. Cover the entire surface of the plate and trim the excess tape from around the edges of the plate. You can use decorative duct tape to tape the plates and decorate your frisbee at the same time. Cut a circle out of the center of the plates. Cut out the center of the flat portion of the plate. Your circle should be about 3 inches in diameter. Trace a circle using a large cup. Stab scissors through the center of the plate and cut out the circle leaving the edges of the plate intact. Tape the two plates together. Attach the plates together with the packing tape around all the edges. Cover the entire decorated surface of the plate with the tape. Tuck the excess ends of the tape around the hole in the center of the plates. Toss your frisbee. Hold the frisbee parallel to the ground and throw it by snapping your wrist as you release. Fold a Frisbee with Post-it Notes Fold the Post-it note it half. Fold the Post-it so that the sticky end sticks to itself. Position the Post-it so that the sticky end is on the left side. The sticky part will be on the inside of the fold. Crease the top right corner down. Fold the corner down so the right edge of the Post-it is aligned with the bottom edge. The post it should look like a square on the left half and a folded triangle on the right half. Unfold and open the Post-it. You will see a vertical crease down the center of the sticky portion and two diagonal creases along the bottom. Fold the sticky ends to the center. The sticky end will hold the edges down. Fold both edges to the center. The Post-it should be  in a \u201chouse\u201d shape. Refold the post it in half. It should now have a point on one end with the diagonal crease visible on the other side. Push the square end toward the center and flatten to form a parallelogram. Fold the end along the diagonal creases in an inward fold. This is the basic shape that will be used to form the frisbee. If you look at the post it from the open side of the folds, you should see a V shape. One side of the parallelogram will be a single point while the other end will have two flaps. Fold seven more Post-its for a total of eight. You will need eight folded parallelograms to create your frisbee. Connect the shapes together.

You can push the opposite edges of the donut shape together to transform your frisbee into a star shape. Making a Frisbee from Paper Claws Fold eight sheets of paper into paper claws. Use colored paper to make a colorful frisbee. You will need to fold all eight sheets into claws to create your frisbee. Insert the point of one claw into the opening of another. Use tape to secure each claw together. Continue inserting the claws into one another to create an octagonal shaped donut. Wrap the frisbee with tape. Use scotch tape or duct tape to give stability and strength to your paper frisbee. Use tape to connect each claw together. Wrap the entire frisbee using decorative tape to add stability and a design element. Throw your frisbee. You should be able to get considerable distance with the ring shaped frisbee. If you use duct tape to wrap the frisbee it should be used outside because it can be thrown a long way!",
