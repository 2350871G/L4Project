If the distance between 2 trees is greater than the length of your hammock, you can use chains or rope to make your hammock reach.

If your body is resting on the ground when you get in your hammock, raise the tree straps up to raise the hammock. Hanging a Hammock Indoors Choose 2 walls to hang your hammock between. The distance between the walls should be at least the length of your hammock. Choose sturdy walls that have studs in them that can support the weight of the hammock.

Look for eye bolts at your local hardware store that are designed to carry heavy loads. Make sure the eye bolts you use are able to hold your body weight. Twist each eye bolt counterclockwise until the screw part on the bolt is completely in the hole. Attach the ends of your hammock to the eye bolts using an S-hook.
