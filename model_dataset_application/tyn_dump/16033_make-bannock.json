  "text":" Preparing the Dough Combine all the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Add 3 cups (384 g) flour, \u00bd cup (65 g) powdered milk, 2 tbsp (29 g) baking powder, and 1 tsp (5 g) salt to the bowl. Mix with a whisk until they are well combined. You can substitute some of the all-purpose flour for cornmeal or other whole grain (wheat, multigrain, oat, etc.) if you would like a different flavor. Make a sweeter bannock by adding 3 tbsp (37.5 g) sugar. If you are making bannock for breakfast or want a sweeter treat, add sugar to the mix. You can also sprinkle cinnamon and sugar over the finished bread for a great breakfast or brunch treat. Add 2 tbsp (25 g) shortening to the mixture. Fold the shortening into the dry mixture.

Baking in the Oven Shape the dough into a flat circle \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Sprinkle some flour on a clean surface and place the dough on top. Shape it into big, flat circle or oval shape. Prick the top of the dough in several places with a fork. Piercing the bannock before it goes in the oven will ensure it bakes evenly.

Allow the bannock to cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve it. Take the bannock out of the oven and leave it to cool off. Then, slice it into squares and enjoy it with jam or butter. Frying the Dough Break off pieces of the dough and flatten them with your palm. After you\u2019ve kneaded the dough, start to break off fist-sized pieces with your hand. Place them on a clean surface and flatten them gently with the palm of your hand. The faster you go from mixing the water in the dough to putting it on the skillet, the lighter your bannock will be. Heat oil on a cast iron skillet. Pour about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oil on a skillet. Heat it on the stovetop or on a grate over a fire. The oil in the pan should be hot, but not scalding. If there is smoke coming from the pan, it\u2019s too hot. Fry the bannock pieces over medium heat. Add a few bannock pieces to the skillet. Fry them until they are golden brown on one side. Flip the bannock pieces and fry them on the other side. You can use a spatula to flip each bannock piece over to fry the other side. If you don\u2019t have a spatula handy, try flicking your wrist as you hold the skillet to encourage the bannock pieces to flip. Place coals on the skillet lid to cook both sides simultaneously. If your skillet has a sturdy lid, put it on when you start frying the bannock. Place hot coals on top of the lid to cook the top side of the bannock while the bottom is frying. Be sure your skillet is in a stable position above the fire so it doesn\u2019t fall when you put the coals on top. Try roasting the bannock on sticks if you don\u2019t have a skillet. If you don\u2019t have a skillet handy, you can still cook the bannock over an open fire. Form long strips of bannock around \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) thick and 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and wrap each one around the end of a long stick.
