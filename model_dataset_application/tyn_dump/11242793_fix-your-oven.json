Open the oven door and engage the locking mechanism. Pull the handle to open the oven door all the way. Look for a bracket near the hinge of the door. Flick or swivel the bracket into position so the oven door remains open at a 45-degree angle. Open the door all the way to engage the lock, then close the oven door until the locking mechanism prevents you from closing it. Lift the oven door straight up to remove it. With the lock engaged and the door at a 45-degree angle, grab the sides of the oven with your hands. Gently slide the oven door straight up to remove it from the hinges. Pull the door out of the oven. Be careful not to drop the oven door or it break. Place the door on a flat surface to work on. It will be much easier for you to access the hinges and work on the oven door if you lay it flat on a table or a desk. Clear the area so you can work unimpeded. Lay down a towel or newspaper to prevent the door from scratching the surface. Remove the screws from around the hinges and the side of the door. There are 4 screws around each hinge that need to be removed. You also need to remove the screws along the sides, top, and center of the door. Be careful as you remove the screws because the door will start to come apart. You don\u2019t want to lose any pieces. Keep all of the screws together so you don\u2019t lose any of them. Lift and remove the inner panel of the door. Push the hinges up to raise the inner panel so you can get a grip on it with your hands. Raise the inner panel to separate and remove it. Pull out the hinges from each side of the door. Lift up the internal panel of the door just enough for you to grab the hinge. Gently slide the hinges out from the door and set them aside. You may be able to scrap or sell the faulty hinges to a hardware store. Place the new hinges in the channels. After you\u2019ve pulled out the old hinges, gently raise up the internal panel and insert the new hinges into the channels that held the old hinges. They should fit neatly into place. Lower the panel back down over the hinges. Make sure you put the left and right hinges in the correct sides of the oven door. Replace the inner door panel and replace all of the screws. With the new hinges installed, put the door back together by lining up the inner panel and screwing it back into place. Put the screws that were around the hinges back into place as well to secure the hinges. Be sure to place the correct screws in the correct slots or it could weaken the integrity of the door. Screw the panels together tightly so the door is held together securely. Line up the hinge with the metal bracket of the oven and replace the door. To replace the door on the oven, look for little notches on the hinges. Line up the notches with the brackets on the oven and fit them into place. Close the oven door to reattach it. Open and close the oven door a few times to make sure it\u2019s correctly aligned.",
