In general, try to keep your cuts equal so that each piece of the same type of vegetable looks uniform. For example, if you are cutting up cucumber sticks, make them all the same width and length.

For example, if you\u2019re going to make a heart, you could create the outline of the heart with grape tomatoes or even sliced red peppers, and then you could fill it it with rows of different veggies, like carrots, cucumbers, and radishes. For a turkey, you could use a bowl of dip for the \u201cbody\u201d and long, layered veggies to create the feathers. A layer of sugar snap peas, then sliced red pepper, then baby carrots would give your turkey a lot of vibrant color and would be very attractive.
