    "Use a nap roller to apply a base coat using angled, upwards strokes.",
    "Start applying the paint about 12 inches (30 cm) from the bottom of the wall and stop about 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) from the ceiling.",
    "Work in sections about 3 feet (0.91 m) wide and roll the paint onto the wall in smooth, even strokes for full coverage.",
    "Apply more paint to the roller as needed, but be sure to remove the excess paint by running the roller over the ridges in the paint tray.",
    "Complete the base coat by sweeping the roller up and down.",
    "Work in 3 feet (0.91 m) sections, filling in the gaps completely before moving to another section.",
    "The paint strokes should slightly overlap to make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps.",
    "Be sure to paint the space between the bottom of the wall and the ceiling and any corners, too.",
    "Let the paint dry fully dry overnight or wait for 12 hours.",
    "Before you add your brick accents, the base coat needs to be completely dry.",
    "Otherwise, the two paints could mix together and form splotchy bricks with paint clumps.",
    "Leave the wall to dry overnight or wait 12 hours before testing a small section of the wall by touching it to see if the paint is fully dry.",
    "Point a fan directly at the wall to make it dry faster.",
    "Apply painter\u2019s tape to your wall to act as a stencil.",
    "Peel off long strips of the tape and apply them to the wall vertically, then peel long strips and apply them to the wall horizontally to form a grid pattern.",
    "The tape will form the gutter or \u201cgrout\u201d by keeping the base coat free from your \u201cbrick\u201d color.",
    "The size of the rectangles in your grid will be the size of your \u201cbricks,\u201d so apply your tape to the wall to form bricks that are the size you want them to be for your wall.",
    "When you peel the tape off after painting the wall, it won\u2019t leave any residue behind and will form even lines.",
    "Use an earthy red or brownish matte enamel paint to imitate brick.",
    "When you\u2019re choosing your paint color, go with one that looks like a natural brick color.",
    "A simple matte paint will work great to form your bricks and can simulate a weathered or distressed brick aesthetic.",
    "Choose the same type of paint that you used as a base color so the two paint colors appear to be part of the same material.",
    "Fill the reservoir of the paint tray with your brick paint color.",
    "Make sure the paint tray is cleaned out of any previous paint that may have been used so there isn\u2019t a mixing of the colors.",
    "Fill the reservoir with the paint you plan to form your bricks out of, but be sure not to overfill the tray.",
    "Leave the ridges used to remove excess paint from the paint roller exposed in case you need to use them.",
    "You don\u2019t need as much paint as you did for the base coat.",
    "Fill the reservoir with about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of paint.",
    "Dip a large sponge into the mixture and apply the paint to the wall.",
    "A large, rectangular sponge measuring about 8 inches (20 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) high will help make the work of forming bricks really easy.",
    "Lightly dip one side of the sponge into the brick paint color and dab it into the square formed by your painter\u2019s tape.",
    "Use the other side of the sponge to wipe up any excess paint.",
    "Soak the sponge in clean water and wring it out before dipping it into the mixture so it\u2019s already dampened to prevent the paint from clogging up the sponge.Tip: For a more distressed look, lightly dab the paint onto the wall.",
    "Continue to apply your \u201cbricks\u201d to your wall until you fill the entire wall.",
    "Repeat the process of dipping the sponge into the paint and pressing it onto your wall to form your bricks until you have filled the entire wall and painted each rectangle of the grid.",
    "Make sure you\u2019ve applied an even coat of paint to each of your \u201cbricks\u201d so that they appear consistent.",
    "Allow the paint to dry 12 hours before removing the painter\u2019s tape.",
    "When you are finished applying your faux brick paint, let the paint dry completely by waiting overnight or allowing 12 hours for the wall to dry.",
    "You can then remove the painter\u2019s tape by starting at one end and slowly peeling the tape off.",
    "Test the paint by touching it to make sure it\u2019s fully dry before you remove the tape."
