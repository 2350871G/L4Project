          "description":"Try to chill a metal steam pitcher about 30 minutes before you want to make latte art. Remove the cold pitcher and pour in cold milk until it reaches the bottom of the spout. This will give the milk room to expand and foam as it heats. For example, if you have a 12-ounce (355 ml) pitcher, pour in about 10 ounces (295 ml) of milk. Because of its high fat content, whole milk is easier to steam than skim or low-fat milk."

          "description":"Lower the steam wand back down so it's about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) away from the top of the milk. The milk should not stretch too much nor should there be any big bubbles. This will create smooth, velvety microfoam instead of dry, stiff foam. The microfoam is steamed milk that is made up of many tiny bubbles. This makes a softly textured milk that's easy to pour into art. Keep in mind that the milk will continue to heat for a little bit after you've turned off the steam wand. Avoid overheating the milk or you'll increase the risk of burning yourself. Once you get used to steaming milk, you probably won't need the thermometer. With a little experience you can usually tell how hot the milk is by just feeling the temperature of the pitcher."

Avoid leaving the tamped espresso to sit for very long in the portafilter, especially if the portafilter is hot. This could burn the espresso.

You should notice a creamy foam at the top of the shot. This is the crema. With a little practice, you should be able to start the espresso and steam the milk at the same time.
