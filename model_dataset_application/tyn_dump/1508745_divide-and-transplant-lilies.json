          "description":"After 3-4 years, your lilies will have developed a large bulb structure underground and can start to get crowded in your garden. Wait until the fall when the stems and leaves turn from yellow to brown before you dig up the bulbs. That way, you won\u2019t harm any plants while they\u2019re blooming. You can also try to transplant in the early spring, but your lilies may not bloom as well or produce as many flowers. Avoid digging up the bulbs on a warm, sunny day since you could damage the bulbs."

Once you get the tip of your shovel 6 inches (15 cm) down, pull the handle toward you to pry up the bulbs. If your lilies don\u2019t pry out of the ground right away, then pull your shovel out of the ground and go on the opposite side of your lilies and push your shovel in again. Continue loosening the soil around the lilies in a circle until you\u2019re able to ease them out of the soil. Don\u2019t start your shovel too close to the lilies since you could damage the bulbs underground. You can also use a gardening fork if you don\u2019t have a shovel."

Put the bulbs into piles based on their sizes since larger bulbs will bloom sooner than small ones. The largest lily bulbs that you dig up will bloom during the next season.

    "Plant all the bulbs of the same size in a similar area rather than mixing them together.",
    "Otherwise, your lilies won\u2019t look as full.Tip: Keep your clusters of bulbs spaced 8\u201318 inches (20\u201346 cm) apart so they don\u2019t overcrowd and have room to expand.",
    "Backfill the hole with soil and mark its location.",
    "Cover the top of the bulbs with the leftover soil from your hole and continue filling until it\u2019s level with the rest of the ground.",
    "Lightly press down on top of the soil to compact it so it\u2019s tight around the bulbs.",
    "Put a small post or garden marker in the ground so you don\u2019t forget where you buried your bulbs.",
    "You can also mix 1 part compost with every 4 parts of soil to make it more nutritious for your plants.",
    "Water the soil as soon as you plant them.",
    "Fill a watering can or use a hose with a showerhead attachment to water the soil where you just buried the bulbs.",
    "Continue watering the area until the soil 6 inches (15 cm) below the surface is wet to ensure your bulbs get water.",
    "Keep your soil moist through winter if you don\u2019t get any snow cover.",
    "Transplanting Lilies in Containers Get a pot that\u2019s at least 3-4 times the height of the largest bulb.",
    "Measure the size of your largest bulb so you can find a pot that\u2019s large enough for it.",
    "Look for a pot that\u2019s at least 2-3 times wider than the bulb\u2019s diameter and that\u2019s 3-4 times the height to ensure you\u2019re planting the bulbs low enough.",
    "Make sure the pot has drainage holes so water doesn\u2019t sit in the soil for too long or cause your bulbs to rot.",
    "Plan to get 1 pot for every 3-5 bulbs you have.",
    "Fill the bottom of the pot with 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of compost.",
    "Put a piece of broken pot over the drainage holes so the compost doesn\u2019t fall out.",
    "Find a good compost mix from your local gardening store or use your own.",
    "Cover the bottom 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of the pot with the mixture and pack it down lightly so you have a level surface.",
    "Don\u2019t pack the compost too tightly or else the roots may have trouble growing once your lilies are in season.",
    "You can use things like organic garden compost, food scraps, or a packaged perlite mixture.",
    "Place 3-5 bulbs \u20442 in (1.3 cm) apart in the compost so the pointed ends face up.",
    "Set the bulbs about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge of the pot in a circular pattern.",
    "Leave about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) between each bulb so they have time to grow without getting too crowded.",
    "Make sure the pointed ends of the bulbs are face up or else your plant won\u2019t grow.Tip: Use the largest bulbs in your pots if you want blooms during the next growing season.",
    "Otherwise, it will take a few years to see any flowers.",
    "Cover the top of the bulbs with 6\u20138 in (15\u201320 cm) of soil.",
    "Use a regular potting soil mix or a compost mixture for filling the rest of your pot.",
    "Continue filling the pot with another 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) of the soil and level it off near the top.",
    "Pack the dirt in lightly so it compacts around the bulbs and promotes healthy growth.",
    "Don\u2019t back the dirt too tightly or else the flowers will have trouble growing and blooming.",
    "Water the bulbs and keep them in an area with 8-10 hours of sun per day.",
    "Use a watering can or a hose to dampen the soil.",
    "Continue watering your bulbs until the soil is wet 6 inches (15 cm) below the surface.",
    "Set the bulbs in an area that gets 8-10 hours of sunlight daily so the bulbs have time to establish themselves before the growing season.",
    "You can keep the pot outside if there isn\u2019t an area inside your home that gets full sun.",
    "Keep the soil in the pot moist throughout the winter so your bulbs get water."
