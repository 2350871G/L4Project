Turn on the stove and melt your wax, stirring constantly. Medium to high heat should be sufficient to melt wax. The amount of wax you use depends on how many fire starters you're making. More fire starters will need more wax. You only need a small amount of wax, around a cup (240 mL) or less, to make a single candle."
