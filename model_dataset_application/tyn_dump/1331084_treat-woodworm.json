Identify woodworm by scanning the surface of the wood for a series of tiny holes on the surface, resembling pinpricks; these occur when the insect matures and exits the wood. Small heaps of powdery sawdust are also a sign; make sure to inspect the entire surface since the condition may only affect one small section of the wood. Look up pictures of woodworm to be sure that you are diagnosing the problem correctly."

When this is the case, the wood item will still be strong and salvageable. If the wood crumbles or breaks off with ease when handled, this is a sign that there is not much hope of saving the item, even after a treatment."

Place small pieces of furniture on a radiator or in the oven, and place larger items in a closet or small room with a space heater. Aim to heat to 140 degrees F and keep at this temperature for 24 hours to kill eggs, larvae and fully grown insects. Monitor items carefully while heating to avoid overheating wood or upholstery."
