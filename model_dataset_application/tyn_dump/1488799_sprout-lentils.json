  "text":" Preparing the lentils Choose the lentils for sprouting. Any of the brown, green or whole red lentils will work. Wash the lentils thoroughly. Place them in a sieve or fine-holed colander and wash under running water. Remove any debris. Soaking the lentils Place the lentils into a large, clean jar. Fill the jar with lukewarm water. Cover the jar. Cover the top of the jar with muslin or cheesecloth. Secure it in place using a rubber band or tightly tied twine. Absolutely do not cover the jar with the solid lid. Soak the lentils. Leave the jar in a warm place, overnight. The lentils must soak for at least 8 hours. Your hot water cupboard or in the kitchen near to where to cooking is happening can make nice warm places to encourage germination. Drain the lentils. Pour off the water the next day. Leave the muslin cover in place while pouring (this keeps the lentils in there). Turn the jar upside down and drain well. The easiest way to do this is to sit it in a colander or similar kitchen tool. Sprouting the lentils Let the sprouting begin. Once drained, turn the jar on its side and leave in a warm place. Keep it away from direct sunlight. Rinse and drain regularly. Each day remove the lentils from the jar and rinse well. This moistens them and helps them to continue germinating, then growing. Remove any lentils that haven't germinated (begun to sprout) and return the sprouts to the jar to keep growing. Use when they have sprouted enough. The sprouts are ready to eat when they're about 3cm/1 inch in height. Usually this will be achieved after 2 to 3 days of growing. Use as wished. Lentil sprouts can be used in a variety of ways, such as adding them to stews and soups, tossing into stir-fries, plumping out a salad or part of a salad sandwich.
