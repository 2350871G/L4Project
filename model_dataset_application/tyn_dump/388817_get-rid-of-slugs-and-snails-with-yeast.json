A suggested mixture is two cups of warm water, a packet of dry yeast, and one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar. The salt will help ensure that the slugs and snails die before they have a chance to escape. If you're going to dump the slugs and/or mixture in your garden or compost pile, skip the salt; it'll make your soil too salty."
