          "description":"Use a soap without detergent so it won\u2019t damage the leather. Combine it with distilled water, which won\u2019t contain any potentially harmful particles that tap water could have. A mild moisturizing soap with aloe vera or essential oils will help restore some moisture to the leather and prevent future cracking. You can also buy special leather cleaner or saddle soap from a shoe repair store, leather care store, or online retailer. While these are more expensive, they often have protectants in them, too, to help keep your leather fresh. Cleaning Different Types of Leather\nCalfskin or full grain leathers: Use a leather cleaning soap to wipe away marks. Nappa: This very delicate material, made from goat, should be treated with a leather balm. Suede and nubuck: Opt for a suede shampoo, along with a stiff-bristled brush to remove dirt. Crocodile, lizard, or snakeskin: Look for a cream specifically designed for reptile or exotic leather that won't damage the expensive material. Patent leather: Rub off scuff marks with patent leather cleaner or petroleum jelly."
