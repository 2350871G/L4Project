This will prevent the stone from getting scratched by brushes with abrasive bristles. If you are cleaning natural stone countertops, a clean cotton rag or a handheld duster can remove surface debris. Sweep all the dirt and dust into a dustpan and dispose of it. If you are cleaning natural stone floors, you can also use a vacuum. Sweep or dust your natural stone at least twice a week."

Mix the water and soap together until bubbles start to form on the top. Read the label of the dish soap that you are purchasing to make sure that it doesn't contain any acid, which could damage the natural stone.
