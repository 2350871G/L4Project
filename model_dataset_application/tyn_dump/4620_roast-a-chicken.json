Refrigerate the uncovered chicken for up to 1 day.Tip: Look for an organic or free-range chicken since these usually have the best flavor and texture.

If you pre-heated the skillet or roasting pan, carefully take it out of the oven and set it on the stove. Drizzle the olive oil into the bottom of the skillet and swirl it a little.

To test if it's finished, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh. If it hasn't reached 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), check it again in a few minutes. Keep in mind that it will take longer for a heavier bird to cook than one that doesn't weigh as much. If you're using a 3 lb (1.4 kg) chicken, you may want to check it after only 50 minutes."
