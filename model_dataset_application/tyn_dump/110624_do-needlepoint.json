You can purchase a blank canvas if you plan to draw your own needlepoint design onto it, or you can buy a canvas that already has a design printed on it. Choose a frame that will be large enough to hold your canvas. A premade needlepoint design is the best option if you are new to needlepoint."

Use 1 in (2.5 cm) wide or smaller tape. Fold the tape along the edges of the canvas to cover them completely from end to end.

Then, place the other side of the frame over the top of the canvas and secure the pieces together to hold the canvas taut. You can also use stretcher bars and tacks to secure your canvas. Avoid working on loose canvas. This may increase your chances of distorting the fabric when you pull stitches taut."

You can use any type of embroidery floss, thread, or yarn you like to do needle point. However, a multi-strand embroidery floss is recommended since you can pull it apart as needed for thinner stands. If you have a hard time threading the needle, insert the tip of the thread into your mouth and wet it with your saliva. This will stiffen the thread and make it easier to push through the eye of the needle.Tip: Make sure to select a needle that you can insert all the way through your canvas with ease.
