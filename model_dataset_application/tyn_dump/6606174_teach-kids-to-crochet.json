Once the child gets comfortable with those hooks, you can gradually reduce the needle size, if you want. Avoid using black yarn. It can be very difficult to see the knots in black yarn, making it hard for the children to see what you\u2019re doing, or whether they\u2019re following your instructions correctly.Did You Know? If you\u2019re working with very small children, you can skip the hooks altogether and teach hand-crocheting to start with. Just show them how to make the knots with their fingers, instead."

Choose what you want work on before you sit down to talk about crochet, and tailor each lesson to the child\u2019s age and skill level. For example, you might want to start out by having a lesson where you make a simple chain. The next lesson, you might work on single crochet, then double crochet once they get the hang of that.
