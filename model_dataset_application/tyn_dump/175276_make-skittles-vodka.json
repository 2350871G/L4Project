  "text":" Single Serving (25mL Shot) Separate the colors of Skittles that you want to flavor the vodka with. Many people choose to leave out the green, which is lime if you're using original Skittles, and purple, which is grape in the original style, as they can create a weird taste combination or a less than appealing color for the final product. However, you can put them in if you want. If you don't mind mixed flavors, you can just skip this step altogether. Note that if you choose to mix the flavors together, you will create an unappetizing brownish color. Add six Skittles to 25ml of vodka. Keep swirling the mixture until the Skittles are almost completely dissolved. Note that the ratio of Skittles to vodka varies from recipe to recipe. You should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles. Filter out the remaining Skittle bits. With single servings like this, you can decide which flavor(s) you like best and proceed to making bottles, if you desire. Bottles of \"Skittled\" Vodka Pour out some vodka from a bottle to make room for Skittles.  Separate the Skittles by color. If you want two flavors mixed together, separate them together. Add the Skittles (20-25 per 350ml/11.8 fl oz).  Let the mixture sit for a day or two. Shake occasionally so the flavour mixes well. Strain out the Skittles using a filter, such as a paper coffee filter or a clean T-shirt.  Refrigerate overnight.  Dishwasher Bottle Method Separate the colors from five bags of 200g Skittles.  Using 5 x 700ml/23.6 fl oz bottles, pour 300ml/10.1 fl oz of vodka into a jug and fill each bottle with skittles.  Place the bottles in your dishwasher and put on an intensive cycle. One third of the way through the cycle, shake all bottles vigorously. Two thirds of the way through the cycle, shake all bottles vigorously. Once the cycle has finished, shake all bottles vigorously again. Then place in the freezer for 2 hours. Once the vodka is cold, it should be syrupy. Take a sieve, line it with a piece of cheesecloth (muslin) or a coffee filter, place above a large jug and pour the vodka through slowly. Once the first bottle has been filtered, wash out the bottle and pour the Skittles vodka back in.  Repeat the above two steps for all bottles, ensuring that everything is cleaned between uses to prevent color contamination.  Place all of the bottles in the freezer until you are ready to drink. Don't worry, the vodka won't freeze. You are finished. Enjoy your tasty creation.",
