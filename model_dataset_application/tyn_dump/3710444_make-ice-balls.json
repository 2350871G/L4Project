Use the following steps:\nFill the cup or mug to the brim. Set aside. Fill your mold. Keep a finger over the mold's fill hole. Turn the mold so that the hole points down and your finger is blocking the flow of water. Put the cup in the sink (or somewhere else where you don't mind spilling water.) Slide the mold into the cup hole-down (keep your finger over the hole as long as possible as you slide it into the cup.) The extra water should flow over the sides of the cup. The hole in the mold should point down at an angle \u2014 not straight down. Put the cup and mold into the freezer. If you have trouble removing the mold when the ice is frozen, run warm water over the outside of the cup where it meets the mold."
