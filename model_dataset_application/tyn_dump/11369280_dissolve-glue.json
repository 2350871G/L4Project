          "description":"Dump out  enough vinegar to completely soak the dried substance. Depending on the size of the hardened glue, let it soak into the glue for 3-5 minutes. Next, blot away the vinegar and glue with a dry paper towel. Continue wiping until you\u2019ve completely removed the glue from the surface. If you\u2019re only working on a small area, start with 1 to 3 teaspoons (4.9 to 14.8 mL) of vinegar before moving on to larger amounts. Make sure that all of the glue is covered with vinegar, or else it might not fully dissolve. Test the vinegar on a small part of the surface to make sure that vinegar won\u2019t do any damage. If the glue was stuck to a smaller item, like a plastic plate, then be sure to wash the object after the glue comes off. This remedy works especially well with craft and school glue."

Once the glue is saturated, take a clean rag or paper towel and swipe at the portion of dried glue. In a pinch, you can use petroleum jelly instead of oil. This natural remedy works with most surfaces, such as plastic and glass."

If the glue still doesn\u2019t come off after 1 application of WD-40, feel free to repeat these steps until the glue is fully dissolved. WD-40 also works especially well with school glue."

Regardless of the project, aim to wear a face mask or other kind of protective gear that filters any air that you inhale. If an area isn\u2019t naturally well-ventilated, see if you can turn on a fan or open a window to create better air circulation. Try to avoid breathing in any paint solvent directly, as this can lead to future health issues. If the weather is nice, consider working outdoors."

Then, use an old rag to scrub the product into the dried glue. Work in sections as you wipe away the glue, and feel free to add more product as you go. If the solvent comes in a bottle, pour directly over the glue, or apply it to a rag and blot it onto the area. For large areas of dried glue, you might prefer to use a spray-on solvent."

Next, blot away any excess fluid and try to pull apart any glued surfaces or objects. This works especially well with industrial glue or glue that you\u2019ve used in a carpentry or hardware project.

To apply stripper, you can either use a soaked rag, or you can use a bottle to spray the walls directly. Wait around 3 minutes for the paint stripper to chip away at the glue before you try pulling off any wallpaper. Once the glue has dissolved, be sure to blot away and dry off any remaining product. If you\u2019re trying to remove a lot of wallpaper at once, work on 1 patch of glue at a time. You don\u2019t want to overwhelm the room with chemical fumes by tackling too much of the wall at once."
