If your pH is outside of this range, you can add limestone, sulfur, or aluminum sulfate to adjust it. For low-magnesium soils, use dolomitic limestone to raise pH. If your soil is high in magnesium, use calcitic limestone to raise its pH. Regular sulfur additions can gradually decrease pH over time, although its effectiveness depends on temperature, moisture, and bacterial presence. Aluminum sulfate additions can decrease pH instantly. However, this immediate action can make it difficult to control the extent of the pH reduction."

    "Prune your Leyland Cypress using garden pruners.",
    "Begin pruning your tree when it reaches 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) in height.",
    "Only prune the sides, and take care not to remove more than 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of growth.",
    "If you want your tree to stop increasing in height, cut its central upright stem as well as its outside branches.",
    "Apply fungicide every 7 to 10 days after pruning.",
    "Regular fungicide application for at least 6 weeks after shearing will minimize the chances of fungal infection.",
    "This is important because shearing temporarily reduces food production, which weakens the tree.",
    "Watch out for yellow or brown foliage, which are signs of canker diseases.",
    "The most common are Seiridium canker and Botryosphaeria canker, both of which create yellow or brown foliage.",
    "Avoid excessive watering and cut any twigs that show signs of cankering.",
    "Keep an eye out for dark and decayed roots, which are signs of root rot diseases.",
    "Although not common, root rot diseases are dangerous.",
    "Once a tree is infected, there is no way to cure it.",
    "Any infected trees, including their stumps, should be removed completely.",
    "Remove female bagworms during early spring and winter.",
    "Keep an eye out for female bagworms, which carry egg-containing bags that can reach up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) when complete.",
    "Adult females do not have legs or wings, are yellow in color, and have an appearance akin to a maggot.",
    "Bags should either be destroyed or placed into a 5 gallons (19 L) container.",
    "This allows any helpful parasites to escape the bags, while keeping bagworm larvae contained.",
    "Pests can also be treated with a mild insecticidal soap or spray."
