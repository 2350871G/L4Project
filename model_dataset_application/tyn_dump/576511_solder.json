          "description":"Put into basic terms, soldering is the process of melting a metal onto other metal components in order to bind them. Soldering differs from welding. In welding, the component pieces are melted together; in soldering, a softer metal with a lower melting point is used to connect them.Because soldering doesn't melt components, it's useful for more delicate applications, such as electronics work, or plumbing. The purpose of soldering is to bind two other components. Solder can be thought of as a sort of \u201cmetal glue.\u201d It can be used to fill in gaps or hold pieces in place, but doesn't serve any more complicated purpose. Since solder is metallic, it conducts electricity, which is another reason it's so popular for connecting electronic components."

          "description":"Solder is the name of the actual material used in soldering. Historically, many solders contained lead or cadmium, but that has been recently phased out for health reasons. Solder is typically composed of two or more metals combined into an alloy. Silver, antimony, copper, tin, and zinc are all common ingredients. Solder is soft and flexible. It generally comes in a coil, or spool, that can be stretched and bent. Solder has a low melting point, and cools extremely quickly after it's been melted. (350F - 500F)\nSolder can contain a flux core of natural rosin (tree sap) or a chemical acid. The metal of the solder encircles the core, like a tube. The purpose of the core is to serve as a flux, or purifying agent. The flux prevents oxidation in the solder as it cools, keeping it strong and pure."

          "headline":"Use a soldering iron to heat the solder.",
          "description":"Soldering irons come in various configurations, but are essentially straight tools with tips that can be heated to melt solder in place. Most soldering irons typically heat to between 800 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit, so exercise caution when using one. Soldering irons tend to catch a veneer of solder after each use, which can oxidize and reduce the iron's effectiveness on the next use. To clean this off easily, secure a wet sponge before you turn your iron on, and gently drag the tip across the sponge once the iron is heated. A layer of fresh solder on the tip can actually make a soldering iron more effective. This process is called \u201ctinning,\u201d and is done by allowing a bit of fresh solder to melt evenly over the tip before use. Better models of soldering iron come with a heat control that can be adjusted for different projects and types of solder."

    "Instead of a soldering iron, a propane torch is generally recommended for soldering copper pipes together.",
    "These are widely available at hardware stores.",
    "Specialized soldering irons can be used for pipe soldering, but a propane torch is just as effective for most jobs, and much cheaper.",
    "Get appropriate solder.",
    "Manufacturers offer specialized solder wire for soldering pipes.",
    "It tends to be much thicker, usually 1/8\" in diameter.",
    "Pipe solders often contain an acid flux, however solid wire works as well.",
    "Solid wire solder may need a separate flux.",
    "Absolutely avoid using leaded solder for soldering your pipes.",
    "Be sure to closely read the label to determine the alloy composition.",
    "Pipe solders tend to compose mostly tin and may also contain antimony, copper, and/or silver.",
    "Have an abrasive item on hand.",
    "To be sure your solder takes, it's helpful to clean the pipe beforehand by scouring it with an emery cloth, sandpaper, or fine steel wool.",
    "Cut off the water.",
    "Turn off the water to your plumbing before you begin work.",
    "This will allow you to work with your pipes without fear of flooding or spraying the room.",
    "Before you turn the water off, pour a bucket of water.",
    "Keep the bucket nearby in case your torch catches anything on fire.",
    "Cut your pipe.",
    "If you're installing new piping, use a tube cutter to cut any pipe up to an inch in diameter.",
    "Tube cutters are available at hardware stores.",
    "Take it slowly.",
    "A tube cutter works best with slow, steady movement.",
    "Go too quickly and you might dent the pipe.",
    "For larger pipe, you'll have to use a hacksaw.",
    "File off the ragged edges afterward.",
    "Once the pipes are cut, fit them into whatever joints you'll need to solder tight.",
    "Clean up the pipe.",
    "Using an emery cloth or similar abrasive item, thoroughly abrade the area of pipe where you'll be applying solder to smooth and clean it.",
    "A smooth and clean surface will allow the solder to flow into the joint smoothly and seal it evenly.",
    "Solder the pipe.",
    "Fire up your propane torch and apply heat to the pipe you plan to solder.",
    "Maintain even heat by moving the flame all around the work area.",
    "Once the pipe is good and hot, apply the tip of your solder wire to the place you need to seal.",
    "It should melt right away.",
    "Hold the solder on the opposite side of the pipe from your torch.",
    "It should flow around the joint and fill it up all the way around.",
    "Let the joint cool.",
    "It will cool quickly.",
    "Move on to the next joint that needs sealing, if necessary.",
    "Check your work.",
    "Once you're finished, wait a few minutes and then turn the water back on.",
    "Run water through the pipes you soldered and check for leaks.",
    "If there are any, you'll have to repeat the process."
