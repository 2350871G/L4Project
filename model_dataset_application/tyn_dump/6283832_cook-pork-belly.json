In addition to seasoning the meat, the oil and salt make it easier for the fat to render out, resulting in crispier skin. Apply the seasonings by hand, and work the salt and pepper into the slits across the skin.

This brief period of high heat will not cook the pork through, nor should you cook the pork belly at this high heat for the entire time. The intense heat is only meant to crisp the skin. Do not wait for the skin to become dark brown or fully crisped since it will continue cooking at a lower temperature. Cooking it for too much time at a high heat could cause it to burn before the rest of the meat finishes."

Check the pork belly halfway through the cooking process. If the fat gets too hot, it may start to smoke, and you'll need to transfer the meat to a clean baking dish.
