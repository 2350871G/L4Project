Thread the thread or yarn through the eye of the needle, and then pull the thread or yarn through so that most of the thread is on one side and the other side only has a few inches (about 5cm). Grip the needle at the eye to prevent the thread from coming undone as you sew. Keep in mind that you will need more or less thread or yarn depending on the size of the hole. For example, a small hole may only require about 12\u201d (30.5cm) of thread or yarn, while a large hole may require 24\u201d (61cm) to cover it. Thread your needle with more thread or yarn than you think you will need. The size of the needle you use will depend on the item and type of yarn or thread you are using.

You can purchase a darning mushroom in craft supply stores, or simply use an item from around your house. For example, you can use a standard light bulb as a guide for darning socks, or you can use the curve of a large bowl as a guide for darning a sweater or blanket.

Keep using your darning mushroom or embroidery hoop as a guide. Try to create the same weave tightness as the garment you are darning. For example, if you are darning a loose knit, then the stitches will need to be somewhat spaced out. If you are darning a tight knit, then the stitches will need to be tight."

Secure the thread by tying a knot through the last stitch, or by weaving the thread through the item a few more times. If you decide to make a knot, make sure not to pull on the thread or you may end up with puckering. Also, make sure to tie the knot so that it is on the inside or wrong side of your item. Keep in mind that a knot may feel uncomfortable in the bottom of a pair of socks, so it is best to weave through a few extra times instead. This will be enough to hold the darning in place."

If your garment is a medium or bulky weight knit item, then you will need to use a darning needle or yarn needle with a large eye. If your garment is a lighter weight item, such as a jersey, linen, or fine knit, then you will need to use a needle with a smaller eye. You may also consider using a tapestry needle for an item with delicate fabric. A tapestry needle has a blunt tip, so it will be less likely to snag while you are darning it."

Keep in mind that a darned hole will have a slightly different texture than the rest of your item, so it may still be noticeable even if you use the same color and size thread or yarn.

Darning mushrooms are sometimes referred to as darning eggs. Darning mushrooms or eggs may come with or without a stand. Having a stand will make it possible for you to darn sitting or standing while your item rests on a table.
