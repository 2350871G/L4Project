Turn the heat on to low and bring the milk to a light simmer. The milk should just bubble a little when it reaches a light simmer. You can also replace the milk with coconut milk, fish stock, or broth."

          "description":"Place two fillets of skinless fish in the pan with simmering milk. Each piece should be about 1/3 of a pound (150g). The milk should come about halfway up the sides of the fish. Continue to simmer the milk after you've added the fish and let it cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Try to select fillets of fish that are similar in size. This will ensure that they cook evenly. You don't need to turn or flip the fish as it poaches. This could cause it to fall apart or overcook."

If it's hard to poke the skewer into the fish, it needs to poach a little longer. If you take a fork and gently rub it over the fish, the fish should flake. Let the fish cook for another minute and check it again. Fish cooks quickly so, check it frequently."

Serve the poached fish with fresh vegetables, roasted potatoes, rice, or a side of your choice. You can use the poaching liquid as a base for a creamy sauce. Try thickening the milk with a roux, cheese, or pureed vegetables (like cauliflower)."
