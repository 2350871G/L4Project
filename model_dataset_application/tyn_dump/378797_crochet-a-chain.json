The end should be on the front side of your finger, with about 1-1.5\" of yarn extending below your finger. The rest of string should fall behind your finger.

You should see two loops formed around your finger. Now, adjust the second loop that you just made so that it goes over the top of the first loop, forming a sort of slanted X shape. Once you've formed this X shape, you can hold the slack from the rest of the string in your middle and ring fingers on the same hand that is wrapped in yarn."

You should see another loop or circle start to form above your finger, made from the string you're pulling. Once it's about as big as the loop on your finger, slide the whole thing off of your finger carefully. This should leave you with a clear loop and a very open, loose, beginning of a knot.

You want to maintain a tail length of 1-2\". Once the knot is tightened, you should be able to slide it to create a bigger or smaller loop. Place your hook through the loop and set it at a comfortable tightness. This structure that you've ended up with is called a slipknot and is the basis for starting most crochet projects."

The most likely options are to use single crochet or double crochet.

With the last loop of your chain on your hook, push the head of the hook into the very first stitch on your chain. This will make two \"loops\" on the hook. Grab the yarn with your hook, just as if you were chaining normally, and pull it through both loops. This will leave you with one loop on the hook and you'll be ready to start your next \"row\"."
