  "text":" Painting, Folding, and Cutting the Plates Paint the outside of two paper plates green. Get two thin, paper plates with scalloped edges. Flip them over so that the back is facing you. Paint them using a paintbrush and green tempera, acrylic, or poster paint. Let the paint dry before moving on. This project will make a puppet. If you do not wish to make a puppet, use only one plate. Paint the inside of one plate red. Choose one of the plates, then flip it over so that the inside is facing you. Use a clean paintbrush and red tempera, acrylic, or poster paint to make it red. Let the paint dry before moving on. For a neater finish, paint the edge green for the frog's lips. Again, you can do this with tempera, acrylic, or poster paint. Fold the paper plates in half. Make sure that the green part on each plate is on the outside. Once you have a nice crease, unfold the plates and flatten them. Cut the green-only plate in half along the fold. You should do this with a sharp pair of scissors. Leave the red-and-green plate alone. Skip this step if you are not making a puppet. Glue the cut plate to the folded plate to make to pockets. Turn the red-and-green plate so that the green side is facing you. Coat the edge of the plate with glue. Place the two halves of the second plate on top, green side up, with the cut edges touching the folded edges. Let the glue dry before continuing. Do not put any glue along the cut or folded edges, or you won't be able to insert your thumb and fingers. Liquid glue will work the best for this. You can also use a stapler. Don't use hot glue or a glue stick. Skip this step if you are not making a puppet. Fold the plate in half again. The red part should now be on the inside, and the green part should be on the outside. You should have a pocket on the top and bottom of the folded plate. Creating the Feet and Eyes Draw and cut four frog foot shapes out of green paper. Start with V-shapes, with the pointed ends being the bottom. Give each foot 3 to 4 fingers. Make the back feet a little bigger than the front feet. If you don't have any green paper, you can color a sheet of plain paper with markers or paint, and use that instead. Glue the feet to the bottom of the frog. Use liquid glue or a glue stick to secure the feet to the curved part of the semi-circle plate. The big, back feet should be placed to either side of the straight, folded edge. The front feet should be placed 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) in front of them. Cut two semi-ovals out of green paper for the eye base. The semi-ovals need to be taller than they are wide. Something around 2 inches (5.08 centimeter) tall and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide would be ideal. Fold the bottom edge of each semi-oval by \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters). Make sure that you are folding the narrow, flat edge, not the curved edge. This will create little tabs that you can use to glue the pieces to the frog. Glue the eye bases to the top of the frog. Turn the frog so that the feet are on the bottom. Draw a line of glue along the folded tabs from the previous step, then secure them to the top of the frog, right along the folded edge. They can be as close together or as far apart as you want. You can use liquid glue or a glue stick for this part. Adding the Details Glue some googly eyes to the semi-oval eye bases. You can also cut two circles out of white paper, draw a smaller circle inside with a black marker, and use those instead. Another option would be to paint two white circles with two smaller black circles inside. Use googly eyes that are big enough to fill the eye bases, but small enough to leave a rim.
