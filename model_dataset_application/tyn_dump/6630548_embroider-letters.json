          "description":"Free-hand draw the letters right on the fabric that you're going to embroider. A sharp pencil will give a faint outline while a pen will give you a bolder line to follow. Avoid using chalk since it can disappear when rubbed. Use a water-soluble pen or specialty fabric pen so the ink will wash out of the fabric. Free-hand drawing is great for childlike or rustic fonts since the letters don't have to be uniform."

          "description":"If you'd like letters that are evenly shaped, lay a stencil directly on the fabric that you want to embroider. Use craft, scotch, or masking tape to tape down the sides of the stencil if you're worried that it will move as you stencil the letters. Use a sharp pencil or pen to trace around the letters. Stencils can be as simple or intricate as you like. You can make your own stencils on plastic, print them onto paper, or buy them from craft stores."

Lay a piece of paper that has the letters in the font you'd like on the carbon paper. Use a blunt stylus to trace the letters on the paper.

The freezer paper should completely stick to the fabric. Cut it to 8 \u20442 inches (22 cm) by 11 inches (28 cm) so it can run through your printer without getting caught.

The back stitch will make a smooth, continuous letter. Continue to embroider multiple letters with the continuous piece of thread. Begin at either end of your letter.

Cut the thread and back stitch the ends. Once you've finished embroidering the letters on your template, lift the needle up and pull the thread out. Pull away the paper template and cut the thread to leave a 4 in (10-cm) tail. Thread a needle and weave the end into the last letter using the back stitch.",
