Or you can sterilize the equipment by washing it in a bleach solution (1/4 cup or 60 ml of bleach for every gallon or 3.8 liters of water).

You'll need to measure 4.5 pounds (2 kg) of mango pulp into a large pot. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and carefully pour 1 gallon of the hot water over the mango pulp. If you're buying mango, ensure that sorbic acid (sorbate) hasn't been added since it can slow fermentation. It's alright if the mango contains sulfates."
