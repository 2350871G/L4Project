The ice will prevent bending of the can when you begin the punching. Transfer your design onto tracing paper. For the best results, use a design that relies only on its outline, as small details get lost. Use pictures from coloring books, greeting cards, quilt or other crafting patterns or design your own pattern. Mark dots about 1/8 inch (3 mm) apart on the outline. Remove the cans from the freezer and wipe away any condensation that forms. Tape your design to the can with masking tape.
