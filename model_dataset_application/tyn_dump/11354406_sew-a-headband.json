The iron interfacing helps provide more depth to your headband, while the white fabric serves as a base for the patterned side of the headband. If you\u2019d like to have a more detailed plan in place, try sketching a 0.25 to 0.5 inches (0.64 to 1.27 cm) seam allowance along the edge of the fabric pieces using permanent marker.
