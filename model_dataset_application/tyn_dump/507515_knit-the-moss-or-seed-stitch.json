  "text":" Knitting the Seed Stitch or British Moss Stitch Cast on the number of stitches that you will need to complete your project. If you are just practicing, cast on 10 stitches. Do your first row by alternating between knitting one stitch and purling the next. Continue alternating between knitting and purling stitches until you reach the end of the row. Remember to place your yarn either in front or behind the stitch you are making so that the yarn is in the correct position to either knit or purl. Knitting patterns may describe the first row of the seed stitch as K1, P1, K1, (*repeat to end of row). The \u201cK\u201d stands for knit and the \u201cP\u201d stands for purl. Check the stitch type before starting your second row. Before you begin your next row, check the first stitch. If your last stitch was a knit stitch on the last row, then purl that stitch on the new row. If your last stitch on the previous row was a purl stitch, then knit that stitch on the new row. Then continue alternating stitch types as before. As you continue, just remember to:\nPurl your knit stitches. Knit stitches look flatter and have a criss-cross pattern. Knit your purl stitches. Purl stitches stick out more and they do not have a criss-cross pattern. Continue in this two-row pattern until you are finished. Keep checking the stitch type when you start a new row and alternating as you continue the rows until you are finished with your project. Knitting the American Moss Stitch Cast on the number of stitches that you will need to complete your project. You must choose an odd number of stitches in order to successfully knit using the American moss stitch. Do your first row by alternating between knitting one stitch and purling the next. Continue alternating between knitting and purling stitches until there is one stitch remaining on your left needle. Knit the final stitch, making sure it mirrors the first on that row (which it should, since you cast on an odd number of stitches). Remember to place your yarn either in front or behind the stitch you are making so that the yarn is in the correct position to either knit or purl. Check the stitch type before starting your second row. If your last stitch was a knit stitch on the last row, then purl that stitch on the new row. If your last stitch on the previous row was a purl stitch, then knit that stitch on the new row. Then continue alternating stitch types as before. Tackle the third row with the same stitch order that you did the second row. Where you did a purl stitch in the second row, do another of the same kind; where you did a knit stitch, do another. Switch back to the stitch order of your first row, for the fourth row. This will complete the set of four rows. In other words, your pattern should be:\nRow 1: * K1, P1 * K1\nRow 2: * P1, K1 * P1\nRow 3: * P1, K1 * P1\nRow 4: * K1, P1 * K1 Repeat this four-row pattern until you're done with your garment or this part of your pattern. The end result should be something similar to the seed stitch but more elongated.",
