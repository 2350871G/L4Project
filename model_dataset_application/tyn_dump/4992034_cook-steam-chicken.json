  "text":" Prepping the Chicken Purchase a bamboo steamer from an Asian market or online. The bamboo basket is sturdy, but will allow the water below to permeate the basket. It is a kitchen essential and can be purchased at relatively low cost. Choose a good quality chicken. Chefs recommend organic, free-range chicken, since the flavor of the bird is more prevalent in this recipe. Save the battery chicken dishes for dish that is covered in sauce. Defrost your chicken, if it isn\u2019t already defrosted. Leave it in the refrigerator for one day to ensure the cavity is completely defrosted. Then, use it as soon as possible once it is ready. Dress your chicken. Sprinkle salt on the outside and inside of the cavity. Repeat with pepper to taste. Peel your ginger and garlic. Shred the ginger and dice the garlic. Chop green onions into two-inch (5cm) pieces. Stuff two-thirds of the garlic, ginger and chicken into the bird. Save the rest for the steamer basket. Prepping the Steamer Set the bamboo basket in the Dutch oven. Arrange the green onions, ginger and garlic in the bottom. Set the chicken atop the vegetables with the breast side up. It should fit snugly but completely with the Dutch oven lid on. You will not need to use the top of the steamer basket. Pour the water and wine into the Dutch oven using a one to one ratio. Add more if your Dutch oven is larger and you don\u2019t think there is enough liquid to create steam for more than one hour. Keep the ratio the same. Cooking the Chicken Bring the liquid to a boil. Once it is a roiling boil, reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot. Then, allow it to simmer for about one hour. Check the chicken by removing the lid on the pot. Then, make several slits in the breast. If the juices run clear, it is ready. Remove the chicken and let it rest for 10 minutes. Cover it in foil. Opt to save the liquid for stock or simmer it uncovered to create a sauce.  Finished. ",
