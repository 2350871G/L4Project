Drawing the blinds up will prevent you from accidentally damaging them. Stand on a ladder to reach the top of the blinds if necessary.

You should have 1 bracket on each end of the blinds. Brackets look like cubes. They should protrude slightly from the main support bar. If your blinds are very long, you may have additional brackets along the center of the headrail. Identify if you have hinged brackets or sliding brackets.

A good way to tell is to try to slide the front of the bracket. If it moves to the side, you have sliding brackets. If not, you may have hinged brackets. Taking the Blinds out of the Brackets Ask another person to hold the blinds if they are very large.

This will help prevent damage to the blinds. Wooden blinds tend to be heavier than plastic blinds, so you may want to ask someone else to help with these. Remove center brackets first if you have them. For most mini blinds, you will have 2 brackets, 1 on each end of the blinds.

Uninstalling the Brackets Fit a drill with a Phillips head bit or find a screwdriver. Insert the hollow end of the bit into the drill. The Phillips head should be facing outwards.
