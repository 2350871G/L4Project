          "description":"Get 2 12  fl oz (350 ml) cans of your favorite beer and pour them into medium pot. Stir in 2 cups (470 ml) of water, \u00bc cup (68 g) of salt, \u00bc cup (170 g) of packed ground sugar, and 1 tablespoon (7 g) of black pepper with a whisk. Continue mixing the beer brine until most of the salt and sugar dissolves. Add 2 sprigs of garlic and 3 cloves of garlic if you want to put additional herbs in your brine. Experiment with different spices to find new flavor combinations. It\u2019s okay is some of the salt and sugar doesn\u2019t dissolve yet. Beers to Try\nUse a lager if you want a light, caramelized flavor for white meats, such as chicken or turkey. Try a pale ale for hints of malt and hops when you make meats like pork or steak. Use a brown ale or stout if you want a rich, nutty taste for beef and whole turkey."

The ice will melt and cool the beer brine so it doesn\u2019t cook your meat while it\u2019s tenderizing.

Avoid using beer on meat that\u2019s already light or tender, such as steak fillets, since the beer could overpower the flavor. If the meat was frozen, make sure you thaw it completely before you put it in your beer brine. Try beer brine on chicken to give the outside a more caramelized crust.

Pinch the piece of fat with your non-dominant hand using your thumb and index finger, and pull it away from the meat so it\u2019s taut. Hold the blade of the knife as close to the meat as possible and slowly slice downward. Pull the fat so it\u2019s parallel to your cutting board so it stays tight. Continue slicing off as many other pieces of fat from your meat as you want. You won\u2019t have to trim the fat off of all cuts of meat.

If the meat sticks out from the beer brine, you can add more beer or water to the bowl to cover it. You can also put the meat in resealable plastic bags and pour enough beer brine in to cover them.
