Then, add 2 in (5.1 cm) to the measurement and cut a piece of elastic to this length. For example, if your dog's neck circumference is 15 in (38 cm), and then add 2 in (5.1 cm) for a total of 17 in (43 cm). Don't stretch the elastic before you cut it. Keep it slack so that you don't end up with a piece that's too short."

Repeat this until you have added the desired number of beads. You can create a pattern using different color beads, or string beads of the same color onto the elastic. For example, you could do an alternating pattern of pink and white beads, or create a rainbow colored strand with red, green, blue, yellow, green, purple, and orange. You could also add an accent bead to 1 or both ends of the elastic or to the center of the elastic. Choose a larger bead that has a different shape or design than the rest of the beads. Tip: Check to be sure that the beads will fit onto the elastic you have chosen. Hold the end of the elastic up to one of the beads to check."
