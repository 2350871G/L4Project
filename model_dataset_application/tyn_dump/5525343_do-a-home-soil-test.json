    "Some kits even have labelled boxes with terms like \u201cSurplus,\u201d \u201cSufficient,\u201d \u201cAdequate,\u201d \u201cDeficient,\u201d and \u201cDepleted\u201d to tell you exactly how much of each nutrient is found in your soil.",
    "Testing pH with Vinegar and Baking Soda Take a soil sample from several spots throughout your yard or garden.",
    "Dig 4-5 holes to a depth of about 6 inches (15 cm).",
    "Take 1 or 2 scoops of loose dirt from each hole and throw them all into a large container.",
    "Mix the soil together with the same implement you used to dig your holes.",
    "Make sure you dig deep enough for your sample to reflect what lies beneath the surface of your soil.",
    "After all, this is where the roots of your plants will be taking in their nutrients.Tip: A soil sampler tool can make it easy to collect multiple samples quickly and efficiently.",
    "One of these tools will come in handy if you\u2019re in the habit of testing your growing soil regularly (which you should be).",
    "Divide your soil sample up into 2 non-reactive containers.",
    "Split the mixed soil in half and transfer each portion to a separate container made from plastic, stainless steel, ceramic, glass, or enamel-coated metal.",
    "Do your best to distribute the soil equally between them.",
    "Ideally, there should be at least \u00bd cup (30 g) of soil in each container.",
    "Use a clean plastic or stainless steel utensil to pick up the soil and move it to your pair of containers.",
    "In order to determine the approximate pH balance of your soil, you\u2019ll be performing 2 nearly identical tests.",
    "Add \u20442 cup (120 mL) of vinegar to the soil in the first container.",
    "If it starts to fizz, it means that your soil is on the alkaline side.",
    "In this case, it most likely has a pH somewhere between 7 and 8, high enough to react to the acid in the vinegar.",
    "You can use any type of vinegar to perform this test, so long as it has an acidity of at least 5%.",
    "Luckily, this includes most varieties of vinegar sold in stores, including white, wine, apple cider, and balsamic.",
    "If you discover that your soil is alkaline, there\u2019s no need to conduct a second test\u2014you can jump straight to adding helpful amendments like ammonium nitrate, peat, or compost to lower the pH of your soil to a more agreeable level.",
    "Wet the soil in the second container and add \u00bd cup (100 g) of baking soda.",
    "If your first sample doesn\u2019t produce a reaction, it\u2019s likely that your soil is acidic and not alkaline.",
    "Pour just enough distilled water onto your second sample to make a thick slurry, then dump in your baking soda.",
    "If it bubbles, you can reliably estimate that your soil\u2019s pH is between 5 and 6.",
    "You can raise the pH of overly-acidic soil by enriching it with amendments like limestone or hardwood ash.",
    "No reaction at all means that your soil has a neutral pH, which is perfect for cultivating a wide variety of plants.",
    "Consider yourself lucky!",
    "Performing a pH Test Using Cabbage Fill a saucepan with about 2 cups (470 mL) of distilled water.",
    "It\u2019s important to use distilled water, as ordinary tap water is full of chemicals, minerals, and other substances that can throw off your test results.",
    "You\u2019ll find bottles of distilled water at any supermarket.",
    "You can also use your own water if you have a purifier at home.",
    "Just keep in mind that your final analysis may not be quite as reliable if you decide to go this route.",
    "Distilled water has a neutral pH, which makes it ideal for tests designed to gauge the acidity of a given substance.",
    "Add 1 cup (150 g) of chopped red cabbage to the saucepan.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about cutting the cabbage up too fine\u2014you just need to reduce it to a size that will easily fit inside your saucepan.",
    "Once you\u2019ve cut your cabbage, drop it into the water and allow it to start soaking.",
    "Only red cabbage will do for this experiment.",
    "It\u2019s the only kind that contains anthocyanin, a type of natural pigment that will serve as a reagent when exposed to the chemicals in your soil.",
    "Boil the cabbage in the distilled water for 10 minutes.",
    "Place the saucepan on your stove and turn on the cooktop to medium-high heat.",
    "Be sure to set a timer so you\u2019ll know when the cabbage is ready to come off of the heat.",
    "You should notice the water taking on a deep violet color within a couple of minutes.",
    "Simmering the cabbage will turn the water into an all-natural, color-changing test solution without altering its pH.",
    "The longer you simmer the cabbage, the more of its pigment will bleed into the water.",
    "You don\u2019t want it to get too dark, however, or it may make the final color of the water hard to differentiate.",
    "Strain the liquid from the cabbage into a spacious container.",
    "Place a colander or wire strainer over the opening of the container and pour the contents of the saucepan out into it to separate the cabbage leaves from the now purple water.",
    "Allow the water to cool for another 10 minutes or so, or until it\u2019s just slightly warm to the touch.",
    "Grab a potholder or kitchen towel when you go to transfer the water to your testing container.",
    "Both it and the saucepan will be extremely hot.Tip: It\u2019s best to use a transparent container, if possible, since you\u2019ll be assessing your soil sample visually.",
    "Place a soil sample in the cabbage water and watch for it to change colors.",
    "Sprinkle 2-3 spoonfuls of soil from your yard or garden into your homemade test solution, then wait a few moments for it to take effect.",
    "If the water turns pink, it means that your soil is acidic (most likely somewhere in the range of 5-6).",
    "If it turns green or a turquoise color, it\u2019s alkaline (7-8).",
    "How nifty is that?",
    "Don\u2019t forget to throw out the soiled water when you\u2019re done.",
    "It could have a slight staining effect, so be careful not to get any on your hands.",
    "Once you know the approximate pH of your soil, you can take the necessary steps to raise or lower it and create a more hospitable growing environment for your favorite plants."
