A streamlined and pointy nose cone will really increase your paper rocket's aerodynamics. Place your plastic cup on a clean area of the paper, bottom side down. Trace around the bottom to make a perfect circle. Make a small dot in the center of the circle. Draw a small triangle with the tip ending at the circle.

Now that you have both the rocket body and nose cone, it\u2019s time to put them together. Put the cone on one of the rocket ends and tape them together. It\u2019s okay if the cone is a little bigger than the body, just make sure you mold it tightly around the cylinder and tightly seal it with tape. You can test the seal by blowing into the open end of the cylinder. If some air leaks out, use more tape to seal it up. Making the Rocket Body Draw a 5x5 inch square. This will be as the body for your rocket. It's best to use regular 8x11 computer printer paper. Start at the left side of your paper and make a dot at the 5-inch mark. Next, measure 5 inches from the top of the paper and make a mark there. Draw lines to connect these points and form a square in the top left corner. Take your time, there\u2019s no rush. You want your rocket body to be sleek and clean, so try to cut true to the lines you drew. Make a cylinder out of the square. You\u2019ll need a pencil and some Scotch tape for this next part.

Tape around the seams in three different places (top, middle, bottom) to make sure the cylinder stays rolled. Now you\u2019ve got a body for your rocket! Making the Wings Drawing a pair of 2x1 inch triangles. To draw a triangle, all you have to do is draw a 2 inch vertical with your ruler, and then a 1-inch horizontal line from its base, and connect the opposite ends with a diagonal line. Cut out the triangles. You might want to use a smaller pair of scissors for this part. Tape one your triangles to the cylinder body.

Tape your second wing in the same way, directly across from your first wing. Flying the Rocket Insert the straw. Take your plastic drinking straw and insert it into the open end of your rocket. Aim. Be careful not to point your rocket at anybody, and especially not anyone\u2019s face. Instead, make a target and aim for that. How to Make a Target Blow. Take a deep breath in and exhale quickly and forcefully through the straw. Blastoff! Watch as your homemade paper rocket blasts through the air.",
