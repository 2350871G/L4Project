The most common is a combination of 2 tablespoons borax, \u00bc cup vinegar and 2 cups hot water which will kill the mold, deodorize the air and reduce the chances of the mold returning. Borax is a natural cleaning product that does not emit dangerous fumes, is a deodorizer and fungicide and is a natural mold inhibitor. It is also a mineral product with low toxicity and usually quite cost effective. Vinegar is a mild acid that kills 82% of mold species and is natural and safe. It\u2019s non-toxic, has no dangerous fumes, is a deodorizer and can be bought cheaply from the supermarket. Vinegar can be sprayed directly onto the surface and left to sit. Bleach is an effective mold killer and will remove any stains caused by the mold but it produces harsh fumes, can damage the materials it is used on and does not penetrate porous materials. The chlorine in the bleach stays on the surface of porous materials while the water is pulled inside, providing more dampness for the mold to feed on. Use bleach in a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water. Hydrogen peroxide is a good alternative to bleach because it is safe to use and does not damage the environment. It is an anti-fungal, antiviral, antibacterial, and can remove the stains caused by mold. Spray 3% hydrogen peroxide directly on the mold. Ammonia can be used on hard surfaces but does not work on porous surfaces. Additionally ammonia is a harsh, toxic chemical that should never be mixed with bleach; it will produce a toxic gas. You can mix ammonia in a one to one ratio with water to use for cleaning. Baking soda kills mold, is safe, and deodorizes the air. It can even absorb moisture to keep the mold away. Since it kills different species of mold from vinegar, the two are often used together in mold removal solutions. Use 1 tsp baking soda with 1 cup water. Tea tree oil is a natural and effective mold killing solution. It is expensive but is harmless to people and pets, anti-fungal and antibacterial. Make sure your tea tree oil comes from the Melaleuca alternifolia plant and mix 1 tsp. of the oil with 1 cup of water to create the mold killing solution."
