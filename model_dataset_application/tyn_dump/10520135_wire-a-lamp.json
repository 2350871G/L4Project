Either purchase a DIY lamp socket kit or purchase the following: a zinc-plated nipple about 8 inches (20 cm) long, light bulb, lamp cord, lamp base, plug, lampshade, socket, socket cap, harp, knurl washer, and a rubber washer. Each lamp cord is made of 2 wires stuck together: one with smooth insulation and one with ribbed insulation. Take note of each one for later on. If you purchase a flat cord, use a clamp-style wire plug. For round wires, use a two-pronged wire plug. Swap a metal lamp base for a pretty piece of wood if you want a smaller table lamp."

    "Wrap the smooth wire around the brass screw.",
    "Just as you did with the silver screw, locate the brass screw on the side of the socket.",
    "Loosen it until there's a space between its tip and the socket.",
    "Now, wrap the wiring clockwise around it and retighten the screw.",
    "Double-check that none of the insulation is underneath the screw.",

    "Slide the insulator tube that acts as the outer covering of the socket over the inner part of the socket.",

    "Spread the prongs apart and feed the wire into the slot until it hits the end.",
    "Squeeze the prongs together until you feel the wire being pierced by the prongs.",
    "Now, push the plug into the case.",

    "Assemble the lamp and connect it to a power source.",
    "First, replace the harp, which is the metal piece that connects to the lampshade and surrounds the bulb.",
    "Press its prongs together and attach it to the brackets of the socket base.",
    "Now, screw the lightbulb clockwise back into the socket and lay the lampshade over the harp.",
    "You can now connect your plug into a power source and turn it on.",
    "If your lamp doesn't work, double-check the wiring in the socket and plug and try again.",
    "Always remember to remove your lamp from a power source prior to doing this."
