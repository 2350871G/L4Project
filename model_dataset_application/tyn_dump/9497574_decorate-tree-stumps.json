          "description":"The top of your stump may not be flat and smooth, but it will need to be in order for you to make your planter. Turn a chainsaw on and then cut off the top 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) as evenly as possible. The chainsaw should cut through the wood quickly and easily. If you don\u2019t already have a chainsaw and just want to use one for small projects like this one, choose an electric chainsaw over a gas chainsaw. The chainsaw that you use should have a guide bar that\u2019s 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the diameter of the stump. Make sure that you wear safety glasses, gloves, safety pants, cut-resistant safety boots, head protection, and hearing protection when you use your chainsaw. You can expect your chainsaw to cost about $50-$200 USD."

          "headline":"Cut the perimeter of the planter with a jigsaw.",
          "description":"After you\u2019ve created a relatively smooth, flat surface, use a pencil to draw a circle onto it as big as you\u2019d like the planter to be. Use a drill and a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) drill bit to drill a hole along the drawn circle. Then, insert a jigsaw into the hole and follow the line as you saw. If you don\u2019t already have a jigsaw, get one with an average motor power of around 5 amps or 18V and a maximum speed of about 3,000 SPM. Go with a jigsaw that has advanced orbital capabilities so that you can make smooth curved cuts. To avoid injury, wear eye protection and be mindful of where you place your fingers while you\u2019re working. Make sure to take out the battery pack or unplug the cord before you change out blades or reposition the jigsaw. Jigsaws usually cost $50-$300 USD."

          "headline":"Hollow out the center with an axe.",
          "description":"Use an axe to break up the wood located inside of the outline you made. Try to chip away at the center of the stump as much you can with the axe, while being careful to keep your aim inside the outline. Ideally, the planter should be about 6 inches (15 cm) deep. Keep this in mind while you use the axe on the stump. If you don\u2019t already have an axe, consider getting either a small axe or a limbing axe for this project. These typically weigh 1.5-3 pounds (0.7-1.4 kg) and are 20\u201328 inches (51\u201371 cm) long. An axe should cost you about $20-$50 USD. To use your axe safely, get a good grip on it and only use it away from others when you have plenty of light to see what you\u2019re doing. Also, stone-sharpen the blade regularly and keep the blade in a sheath when it isn\u2019t being used."

Direct the drill up and down repeatedly until most of the wood within the circle is broken up into small pieces. Once you\u2019re done, put down the drill and scoop out any loose wood inside of the stump. If you don\u2019t already own a drill, go for a \u215c-inch (0.9 cm) cordless power drill for maximum mobility and versatility. Power drills typically cost about $50-$200 USD. Wear safety glasses, ear protection, and gloves while using your drill.

Then, chip it away from the rest of the stump by tapping a hammer, held in your dominant hand, onto the other end of the chisel. Continue doing this until you\u2019ve chipped off all of the wood you want removed. For this project, you\u2019ll need a nail hammer and a wood chisel. Hammers typically cost between $15-$50 USD and chisels are usually $10-$20 USD each. Wear safety glasses and focus on your aim while using a hammer and chisel to prevent injuries."

Consider painting the plywood a color of your choice after you glue it together. Let the paint dry completely before you set the roof over the stump\u2019s surface.
