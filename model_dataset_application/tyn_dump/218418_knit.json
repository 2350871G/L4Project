Yarn comes in a wide range of textures, weights, and colors, so choose a yarn that appeals to you. Then, check the label on the yarn for a knitting needle size recommendation. For example, if you opt for a medium-weight yarn, then you will need a pair of US size 7, 8, or 9 (4.5, 5.0. or 5.5 mm) needles. You can knit with straight needles or circular needles. Circular needles are helpful for holding a large number of stitches, such as for a blanket, and you can also knit in the round with circular needles. Knitting needles are made from a variety of materials, including aluminum, plastic, and bamboo. The material is more a matter of personal preference than anything else. Tip: You may want to follow a beginner\u2019s pattern when you are ready to knit your first project. Try making a dishcloth or a beanie for a quick and easy knitting project."
