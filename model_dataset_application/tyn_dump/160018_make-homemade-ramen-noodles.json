  "text":" Cooking on the Stove Get a big pot. This should be large enough to put the entire, ramen into without having to break it (you can break it if that is your preference). It should also be small enough so that water can completely cover the ramen noodles. Some people like to eat ramen wet instead of completely drained, so if that's the case, you can be more generous with the water. Pour your preferred amount of water into the pot. If in doubt, try 2 cups, but if you want more, that'll work, too. You can substitute some other liquid for the water, such as soy sauce, or broth, but water will work as well. Boil the water. On most stoves, you should just turn the knob as high as it can go and wait for the water to boil. If, during the cooking process, the pan starts to bubble over the top, just turn it down. Next time you make ramen, do not turn the stove on as high as it can go. So long as the water is bubbling, its temperature is at the boiling point and it is circulating. A furious boil adds little and risks a boil-over, so feel free to turn down the heat a bit once boiling commences. Add the ramen once the water is at a full boil. Use a fork to push the block under the water if it is floating on the top. You can choose to break the block into chunks before adding it, if you prefer shorter, less slurp-able noodles, but it is a personal thing. Stir well. If you want to even out the cooking process and speed it up by keeping uncooked stragglers from the surface, help stir apart the noodles. Wait. Three minutes is the normal cooking time, it may take longer, though. When the noodles are starting to turn slightly yellow, they are done. At this point, the ramen should be completely broken apart, and, when you put your fork in the water, a few noodles attach themselves to your fork. The ramen is ready to eat when it is flexible.

Cooking with the Microwave Put your uncooked noodles in a microwave safe bowl and pour the seasoning on top of the noodles.  Add 2 cups of water, and do your best to dissolve the seasoning in the water.  Carefully put your bowl in the microwave and cook on high for 3-4 minutes. If you broke up the noodles before cooking them, they should be done. Otherwise, you may want to let it sit and absorb for a while. even though it's not as good, it's a bit easier for those who can't stand and stir it while it's on the stove.",
