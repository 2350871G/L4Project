  "text":" Freezing the Wax Place the glass jar or piece of glass in your freezer. Freezing works best for small votive holders or candle jars. Once your candle has cooled to normal room temperature, place it in the freezer. If you put it in when it's too hot, you'll risk cracking the glass from too quick of a temperature shift. Make sure the glass is cool to the touch before you freeze it. Let the wax contract for at least an hour. As the wax and glass begin to freeze, the wax will begin to contract and separate from the sides of the glass, pulling away and making it much easier to remove. Use a table knife to remove the wax from the glass jar. Remove the glass from the freezer after an hour has passed and try to tap the wax out on the palm of your hand. Use your finger or a dull knife to scrape and remove the remaining wax from the glass. Swab the glass to remove any wax remnants. Remove any small remaining pieces of wax residue using a cotton ball or cotton swab soaked in baby oil or vinegar. Rubbing with a slightly damp paper-towel can be just as effective. It might take some elbow-grease, but it should come up. Melting the Wax Boil some water. Bring a pot of water to boiling using the stove or microwave while you prepare the wax.
