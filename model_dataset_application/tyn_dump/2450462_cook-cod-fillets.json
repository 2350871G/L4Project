  "text":" Pan-fried Cod Prepare the cod fillets. Rinse them under running water for a few minutes and pat them dry with a paper towel to absorb any excess water. Pour the milk into a shallow dish.  Soak the fillets in the milk for 15 minutes. The milk takes away strong \u201cfishy\u201d odors. Combine the cornmeal, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. You can transfer the seasoned meal to a plate if you don\u2019t have a suitable bowl. It's easier to coat the fillets with the cornmeal in a shallow bowl or a plate. Heat the oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat for about 3 minutes.  Dredge the milk-soaked fillets in the seasoned cornmeal. Turn them over several times so that each side is completely coated with the cornmeal. Fry the fillets for 5 minutes on each side.  Transfer the fillets to a serving platter.  Drizzle with lemon juice.  Garnish with fresh parsley, and enjoy.  Broiled Cod Prepare the cod fillets. Rinse them under running water for a few minutes and pat them dry with a paper towel to absorb any excess water. Preheat your broiler on high.  Spray your broiler pan with a spray cooking oil. This will prevent the fish from sticking to the pan. After rinsing the fillets under running water for several minutes, place the fillets on the broiler pan.  Coat the fillets with the melted butter using a pastry brush.  Drizzle the lemon juice over the fillets.  Sprinkle the salt, pepper and paprika on the fillets.  Top each fillet with dill weed.  Place the broiler pan under the broiler (about 4\u201d (10 cm) from the heating element.)  Broil the fish for 5 minutes. The cod is done when it flakes easily when pierced with a fork. Transfer the fillets to a serving platter. Use a spatula\u2014the fish will be tender and flaky. Poached Cod Fillets Prepare the cod fillets. Rinse them under running water for a few minutes and pat them dry with a paper towel to absorb any excess water. Combine the water, wine, shallots, potatoes, carrot, salt, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a large, shallow-sided pot.  Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low until the liquid begins to simmer.  Add the cod fillets to the liquid in a single layer. Make sure that the fillets are completely covered with liquid. Poach the cod fillets until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily. This should take about 7 minutes. The internal temperature of the cod fillets should be 175\u00baF. The vegetables should also be tender when poked with a fork. Serve. Place one cod fillet in each bowl and divide the veggies and broth evenly among the four bowls. Garnish the dish with the sliced lemon and chopped parsley. Baked Cod Fillets Prepare the cod fillets. Rinse them under running water for a few minutes and pat them dry with a paper towel to absorb any excess water. Preheat your oven to 350\u00baF (176\u00baC).  Mix the butter and lemon juice.
