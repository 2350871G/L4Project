The simplest way to do this is to string beads, then measure the desired width against the string. Now that you have a width (measured in beads) for your belt, use the graph paper to plan out the design you want.

You want the strip to be fit from just before the hole you plan to use in the belt, and the edge where the stitches attaching the buckle is. To Make Your Own Belt Cut 2 strips of equal size to the width you wish you belt to be. Be sure to leave a bit of room on either side, width wise, beyond where the bead strip will extend.

These strips will be sewn on top of each other to make the belt thick enough. Attach the buckle to one strip according to the directions.

Sew along the edges of the strip with clear beading thread to attach it.
