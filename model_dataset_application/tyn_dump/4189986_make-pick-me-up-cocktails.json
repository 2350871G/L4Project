  "text":" Prairie oyster Gather ingredients. You'll need 1 raw egg yolk, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper to taste and 2 dashes of Tabasco sauce (or other hot sauce you like). Crack the egg first. Tip the egg yolk into the glass without breaking it. (If you can manage that with a hangover, you're on the mend!) Pour in the teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and 2 dashes of Tabasco sauce.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Drink it down in one go. If you're lucky, you'll chase away that hangover. Have some rest. See How to make a prairie oyster for more variations.  Mimosa Pour equal parts of champagne and orange juice into a champagne flute. For champagne: Cava or Prosecco are both great options. Opt for a sparkling wine that is not too sweet, as the sweetness of the orange juice combined with the sweetness of the wine could overpower the drink. Chill the orange juice and champagne beforehand. Lukewarm mimosas are not as dapper as chilly ones. Add a splash of Triple Sec liqueur (optional). While most people think of a mimosa as simply containing orange juice and champagne, a true mimosa contains a splash of Triple Sec to fortify the drink. Stir gently and garnish with mint or fresh fruit. Serve. For a great way to incorporate fruit into the mimosa while chilling the drink, freeze some fruit \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, mango, pineapple, the list goes on \u2014 and then place them in the drink right before serving. They will act as ice cubes and keep your drink cool for you while you sip. See How to make a mimosa and How to make mimosas with twist for more variations.  Red eye Assemble ingredients.
