Be careful as you\u2019re cutting so you don\u2019t cut into the mattress foam with the scissors.

If you know how wide or long you want the piece of foam you\u2019re cutting to be, measure that distance with the measuring tape and use a marker to mark the mattress at that point so you can reference it later. Try not to press down on the foam while you're measuring it so you don't distort the size and shape. Measure 2 or 3 times so you know that your measurement is accurate."

          "description":"Take a long ruler or straight edge and line it up with the point you measured on the mattress. Then, carefully draw a straight line along the edge of the ruler with a marker. Depending on the shape and size of the piece you want to cut, you may need to draw multiple lines. Make sure the straight edge or ruler isn\u2019t slanted before drawing your line by measuring the distance from both ends of the tool to the edge of the mattress. If the distance isn\u2019t the same from both ends, the straight edge or ruler is slanted. If you\u2019re cutting the mattress foam to fit a smaller bed frame, you\u2019ll want to draw a straight line from one short end of the foam to the other. If you\u2019re not cutting a straight line, you can draw the curve you want to cut on a large piece of paper, cut it out, and then trace the curve onto the mattress foam with marker. You can freehand the curve on the paper, or you can trace the curved object you\u2019ll be using the mattress foam for."

Rest the foam on a stable, elevated surface so that the space directly under the marked line is open. For example, you could rest the mattress foam on a table so that the marked line is hanging off the edge. If you\u2019re cutting a large mattress foam in half, try resting it on 2 box springs that have some space in between them. That way, the line down the center of the foam will sit right over the open space."

  "text":" Measuring and Marking the Mattress Foam Remove the zip cover and any lining on the mattress foam. Most mattress foam comes with an outer covering that protects the foam inside. To remove it, simply unzip the cover and pull it off. If there\u2019s additional lining underneath the zip cover, use a pair of scissors to cut and remove it. Be careful as you\u2019re cutting so you don\u2019t cut into the mattress foam with the scissors. You can dispose of the zip cover and any lining after you take it off since it won\u2019t fit your mattress foam anymore once you cut it, or you can try altering and sewing it so you can reuse it. If you toss out the old zip cover, you may need to buy a new one depending on what you\u2019ll be using the mattress foam for. Use measuring tape to determine where you should cut the foam. If you want to cut your mattress foam in half, measure from one side of the foam to the other and then divide that number in half to figure out where you\u2019ll want to make the cut. If you know how wide or long you want the piece of foam you\u2019re cutting to be, measure that distance with the measuring tape and use a marker to mark the mattress at that point so you can reference it later. Try not to press down on the foam while you're measuring it so you don't distort the size and shape. Measure 2 or 3 times so you know that your measurement is accurate. Mark the line you want to cut with a marker. Take a long ruler or straight edge and line it up with the point you measured on the mattress. Then, carefully draw a straight line along the edge of the ruler with a marker. Depending on the shape and size of the piece you want to cut, you may need to draw multiple lines. Make sure the straight edge or ruler isn\u2019t slanted before drawing your line by measuring the distance from both ends of the tool to the edge of the mattress. If the distance isn\u2019t the same from both ends, the straight edge or ruler is slanted. If you\u2019re cutting the mattress foam to fit a smaller bed frame, you\u2019ll want to draw a straight line from one short end of the foam to the other. If you\u2019re not cutting a straight line, you can draw the curve you want to cut on a large piece of paper, cut it out, and then trace the curve onto the mattress foam with marker. You can freehand the curve on the paper, or you can trace the curved object you\u2019ll be using the mattress foam for. Elevate the mattress foam so the marked line doesn\u2019t have anything under it. Since you\u2019ll be cutting through the foam with a knife, you don\u2019t want the line to be on a solid surface or you could end up chipping and scratching it.

Electric carving knives are usually used to slice through food, but you can also use one to easily cut your mattress foam. Because the serrated edges of the knife saw back and forth when it\u2019s plugged in, you can get a cleaner, straighter edge with it.

Just keep in mind that the cut may not be as clean as if you were using a knife. Hold the knife at a 90-degree angle to the foam at the edge. This will make it easier to cut deep into the mattress foam. Position the knife so the sharp edge of the blade is lined up with the line you marked on the foam. Cut along the marked line using an up-and-down motion. If you\u2019re using an electric carving knife, you may not need to move the knife up and down since it will be moving on its own.
