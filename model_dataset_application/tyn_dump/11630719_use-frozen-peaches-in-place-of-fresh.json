    " Working with Frozen Peaches Buy enough peaches for the recipe you plan on using them for.",
    "Before you head to the store, take a look at your recipe\u2019s ingredients list to find the exact quantity of peaches that it calls for.",
    "On average, a 1 pound (16 oz) package of frozen peaches contains about as much fruit as 3 medium-sized fresh peaches.Look for frozen peaches in the freezer aisle of your local supermarket.",
    "Frozen peaches tend to cost slightly more than the same quantity of fresh peaches in-season, but their versatility, convenience, and long shelf life will more than make up for the few extra pennies you\u2019ll pay for them.",
    "Add frozen peaches directly to baked goods without thawing.",
    "One of the biggest advantages of choosing frozen peaches over fresh is that they don\u2019t require thawing.",
    "This makes them perfect for putting together a quick dessert just before dinner or preparing something sweet on short notice to bring to a party or work function.If you like, you can also thaw your peaches briefly (about 10-15 minutes) at room temperature to give them a chance to release excess moisture prior to baking.",
    "Thaw your peaches overnight in the refrigerator before using them like fresh.",
    "Portion out the amount of fruit you want to use in a small bowl or similar container.",
    "Then, cover the container and place it in your fridge for 6-12 hours.",
    "As the peaches thaw, they\u2019ll soften up and shed excess moisture.By opting for frozen peaches over fresh, you can save yourself quite a bit of time and labor that you would otherwise spend peeling, pitting, and slicing.",
    "Keep in mind that your peaches may have a fragile, somewhat mushy texture once thawed.",
    "This is because of the changes that occur in the cells of the fruit during freezing.Alternative: If you\u2019re in a hurry to use your still-frozen peaches, set your thawing container inside a bowl of lukewarm water to speed things along.",
    "Drain your thawed peaches thoroughly.",
    "Once your peaches have defrosted for 20-30 minutes, pour out the liquid that\u2019s collected at the bottom of your thawing container.",
    "This will leave you with just the fruit, which will be almost as sweet, tender, and juicy as if it were picked the same day.Most of the liquid that comes off of your peaches will be water created by condensation during the freezing process, so don\u2019t worry about losing those flavorful juices.",
    "Incorporating Frozen Peaches into Various Recipes Use well-thawed peaches to top cold or fresh dishes.",
    "Spoon a few slices onto a bowl of ice cream or Greek yogurt for an effortlessly delicious version of peaches and cream, or incorporate an entire package into a fruit salad or trifle, along with other assorted fresh or frozen fruits.",
    "If you\u2019re a bona fide peach lover, you could even savor them on their own!Frozen peaches make it possible to enjoy all of your favorite peach-based dishes year-round, not just during the short summer months when the fruit is in season.Tip: It will be particularly important to make sure your frozen peaches have been properly defrosted and drained if you intend to use them in a recipe that ordinarily calls for fresh peaches.",
    "Bake a pie or cobbler using still-frozen peaches.",
    "Take your peaches out of the freezer and throw them right in with the rest of your ingredients.",
    "It\u2019s that easy.",
    "Remember, there\u2019s no thawing necessary here\u2014they\u2019ll warm up gradually in the heat of the oven.Many cooks recommend using twice the amount of thickener in order to absorb more of the moisture released as the peaches warm up.",
    "Alternatively, you could simply increase your baking time by 5-6 minutes to cook off some of the extra moisture created by the thawing fruit.",
    "Work some frozen peaches into your cake, muffin, or bread batter.",
    "Mix together the components for your batter, then stir in 1-2 cups (150-300 g) whole or chopped frozen peach slices.",
    "When your finished confection comes out of the oven, it will have a soft, moist interior that\u2019s bursting with peachy flavor.Other fresh or frozen fruits like blueberries, blackberries, lemons, apricots, cherries, nectarines, and plums tend to pair will peaches.",
    "Frozen fruits tend to work especially well for batter-based items, since the added liquid won\u2019t leave the thick batter soggy or soupy the way it might a pie crust.",
    "Whip up a scrumptious peach smoothie using frozen peaches.",
    "Try this easy peach pie smoothie for a quick after-dinner treat: add \u20442 cup (120 mL) of plain nonfat yogurt, \u20442 cup (120 mL) of milk, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of honey, \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of vanilla extract, and a small pinch each of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to a large blender.",
    "Then, just before you send it all swirling, dump in about a cup (150 g) of frozen peaches.",
    "The firm, frosty peaches will make for an extra thick, extra cold, extra satisfying smoothie.You can even substitute frozen peaches and other varieties of fruit for ice cubes to prevent your smoothie from becoming watered-down.",
    "Skip the ice, double the yogurt, and sprinkle in 1/4 teaspoon (5 g) of ground cardamom to transform an ordinary smoothie into a thick and refreshing Indian-style peach lassi.",
    "Make your own old-fashioned peach ice cream.",
    "Thaw and chop 8-10 cups (about three 1-lb packages) of frozen peaches and puree them in a blender or food processor until they're smooth yet still slightly chunky.",
    "Stir together 6 eggs, 3\u00bd cups (700 g) of white sugar, 4 cups (950 mL) of heavy cream, 2 cups (470 mL) of milk, 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl.",
    "Add the pureed peaches and mix thoroughly.",
    "Afterwards, transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and churn it according to the manufacturer's directions.If you're a vegan or dairy-free eater, it's also possible to throw together a simple 4-ingredient peach ice cream using only peaches, coconut milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract.",
    "Cook up some easy homemade peach jam or preserves.",
    "Thaw and drain 3\u20134 pounds (48\u201364 oz) of frozen peaches and place them in a large saucepan.",
    "Heat the peaches at a low boil for 20-25 minutes, then add 4-5 cups (800-1000 g) of sugar and a small package of pectin (about 1.75 ounces) and continue cooking for another 20 minutes or so, stirring frequently.",
    "Once the mixture thickens, turn off the heat and allow it to cool before transferring it to individual glass mason jars for storage.Stir in 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of cinnamon, nutmeg, or allspice at the same time that you add the sugar and pectin to balance out the sweetness and lend a hint of irresistible spice.",
    "Don\u2019t forget to sterilize your jars by heating them in boiling water for about 10 minutes prior to canning.",
    "A second hot water bath will also seal your jars once you\u2019ve added your jam or preserves.",
    "It\u2019s unlikely that anyone who gets a taste of your jam or preserves will be able to tell that you started with frozen peaches as opposed to fresh.",
    "Blend frozen peaches into a daiquiri or other frozen cocktail.",
    "Shake out a package of frozen peaches into a blender.",
    "Add 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) of rum, 1/4 cup (50 g) granulated white sugar, and 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of freshly-squeezed lime juice.",
    "Blend the ingredients until they're nice and slushy, then pour the concoction into a glass and garnish it with thin slices of peach or lime.",
    "Bottoms up!If you like your frozen drinks extra frozen, drop in 2 whole ice cubes before blending.",
    "Try rimming your glass with coarse-ground sea salt to offset the sweetness of the beverage a bit.",
    "Baking a Homemade Peach Pie Using Frozen Peaches Mix up a simple pie crust from scratch.",
    "Sift 2\u00bd-3 cups (300-360 g) of all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon (4.93 g) of salt into a food processor or large mixing bowl and pulse or fold them together until they\u2019re thoroughly mixed.",
    "Cut 2 sticks of cold unsalted butter into 1 in (2.5 cm) cubes.",
    "Add half of the butter to your dry ingredients and pulse the mixture until the butter is roughly pea-sized and distributed evenly throughout.",
    "Finally, pour \u20442 cup (120 mL) of ice-cold water into the mixture, followed by the rest of the butter, and pulse it repeatedly until it\u2019s smooth.Leave your butter in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to work with it.",
    "Cold butter is the key to a tender, flaky crust.",
    "For a quick last-minute dessert, you also have the option of simply picking up a premade crust.",
    "Refrigerate your pie crust dough for at least half an hour.",
    "Remove the dough from your food processor or mixing bowl and transfer it to a large sheet of plastic wrap.",
    "Cover the dough completely with the plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to chill.",
    "It can stay in there for as little as 30 minutes or as long as 4 days, if you\u2019re not planning on baking your pie right away.When half an hour has passed, press a fingertip into your dough to see if it\u2019s the right texture.",
    "It should be about as firm as a stick of cold butter.",
    "It\u2019s important to keep your dough properly chilled throughout the entire pie-making process.",
    "Pie crust dough is easiest to work with and comes out tasting best if stays between 68\u201372 \u00b0F (20\u201322 \u00b0C).",
    "Roll your dough out into 2 disks.",
    "Once your dough has been in the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes, take it out, unwrap it, and separate it into 2 equal-sized mounds by hand.",
    "Then, use a rolling pin to press both mounds into uniform circles that are each roughly \u20448 in (0.32 cm) thick.",
    "Roll your first circle out to a diameter of about 12\u201313 inches (30\u201333 cm) and spread it out over the edge of a pie plate or pan.",
    "The second only needs to be 11\u201312 inches (28\u201330 cm) in order to cover your pie filling.A pastry scraper can come in handy for peeling the rolled dough off of your work surface in one piece.",
    "After rolling out your top and bottom pie crusts, return both pieces to the fridge and chill them for another 30 minutes.Tip: Dust your countertop, a large cutting board, or another suitable work surface with a light coating of flour to prevent your dough from sticking.",
    "Put together your pie filling.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, combine 8 cups of frozen peaches (about three 1 lb packages), 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of cinnamon, 1\u20132 teaspoons (4.9\u20139.9 mL) of lemon juice, 4 tablespoons (30 g) of cornstarch, and a small pinch of kosher salt.",
    "Fold the ingredients thoroughly with a spatula until they\u2019re evenly mixed.For this recipe, both the lemon juice and cinnamon are optional add-ins.",
    "You\u2019re free to use as much or as little of either ingredient as you wish to suit your own tastes.",
    "The cornstarch will counteract the moisture from the frozen peaches and help thicken up the filling as your pie bakes.",
    "Spoon your filling into your pie crust and chill for another 30 minutes.",
    "Take the dough for your bottom pie crust out of the refrigerator and add the filling mixture.",
    "Place the filled crust back in the fridge for an additional half hour to ensure that all of your components are a consistent temperature.Scrape the bottom of the bowl with your spatula or a small spoon to make sure you get out every last bit of filling.",
    "Cover the filled pie with the dough for the top crust.",
    "Remove the second, smaller disk you rolled out earlier from the fridge and spread it out over the top of the pie, trimming the excess dough from around the edges with a pair of scissors if necessary.",
    "Work your way around the pie, crimping the edges of the dough with your fingertips to seal the two layers.",
    "Finally, use a sharp knife to cut 3-5 thin slits near the center of the pie.",
    "This will allow steam to escape while the pie is baking.You can also crimp the edges of your pie crust with the tines of a work to create a more intricate patterned look.",
    "For a slightly fancier presentation, slice the top crust into 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) strips and weave the strips into an overlapping lattice formation on top of the pie.",
    "Bake your pie for about 1 hour at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C).",
    "Rearrange the racks in your oven so that one rack is resting near the bottom third of the oven.",
    "Then, slide the pie inside and shut the door.",
    "Immediately after putting it in, set a timer on the oven or your phone to keep track of how long it\u2019s been baking.Begin preheating while you\u2019re chilling your pie for the final time.",
    "That way, you won\u2019t have to wait for it to warm up once you\u2019re ready to actually start baking.",
    "Alternatively, bake your pie for 15 minutes at 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C), then lower the temperature to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and continue heating for 35-40 minutes.",
    "This will help you achieve a nice brown crust while also ensuring that the filling get cooked all the way through.",
    "Let your pie cool for at least 3-4 hours before serving.",
    "Once the top crust is perfectly golden-brown and the filling begins to bubble out through the ventilation slits, turn off the oven and carefully pull out the pie using a thick oven mitt.",
    "Set the pie on a heat-safe surface and allow it to cool completely.The filling of your pie will be extremely hot when it first comes out of the oven.",
    "For safety\u2019s sake, wait until the pie has had a chance to cool to room temperature before enjoying a slice, no matter how tempted you might be to dig in.",
    "If you like your pie warm, you can always place it back in the oven at around 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C) until it reaches the desired temperature, or zap a single serving in the microwave for 20-30 seconds."
