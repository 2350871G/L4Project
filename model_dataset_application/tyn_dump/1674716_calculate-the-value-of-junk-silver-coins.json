          "description":"The majority of junk silver is valued almost exclusively by its silver content. However, rare coins accumulate additional value. Search online for the value of your coin by referencing the date and image on the coin. In general, coins that pre-date the 1940s have some collectors\u2019 value. Other coins garner a collector\u2019s value because they are a rare mint. The mint refers to where  the coin was produced and is denoted by a small letter stamped on the coin. A coin may have been produced in mass quantities at one mint, but in much smaller quantities at another mint; if your coin came from the latter, it will be worth more. You must also pay attention to coin grading, which how you determine the quality of a coin's condition. Grading takes into account how well the coin was struck at the original mint, how well it is preserved, and how much wear and damage the coin has suffered. Examples of rare coins include the Kennedy Silver Half Dollars and the Morgan or Peace Dollars. However, newer coins, like the Kennedy Silver Dollar, need to be in excellent physical condition to retain collectors\u2019 value."

          "description":"The silver content of most 1965 U.S. specie is proportional to its denomination. For example, a half-dollar has precisely double the silver content of a quarter. Therefore, the first step in determining the total silver content is to add up the face value of every coin in your collection. Do not include nickels or pennies, which were not made from silver, with rare exceptions like 1942-1945 war nickels. Pricing these, however, can be complicated and so they should also be excluded from your calculation."

          "description":"A dollar's worth of 90-percent-silver coins would originally have contained 0.723 troy ounces of silver. However, because old coins are worn, silver dealers generally calculate on an average weight of 0.715 troy ounces per dollar. A troy ounce is a unit of measurement that is common when weighing precious metals. One troy ounce is equal to 31.103 grams or 1.097 ounces. Because half-dollars circulated less they will generally be a bit less worn. You might be able to expect a slightly higher ratio of dollar value to silver content like 71.8-72.0%. Newer coins might also have a slightly higher silver content."
