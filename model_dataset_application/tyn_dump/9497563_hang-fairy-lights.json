          "description":"Standard-sized fairy lights or Christmas lights may look fine on a tree or large wall, but they will look bulky on smaller items, such as house plants or small mirrors. It would be a good idea to use miniature fairy lights with tiny bulbs for these types of items. Fairy lights that plug into an outlet are great for large spaces, such as walls and trees. Fairy lights that are battery-operated work best for small items, such as mirrors. Netted fairy lights typically come in standard size, so they'll work best on larger items, such as ceilings and shrubs."

          "description":"Christmas fairy lights typically come with a green wire. While this may look great on a tree, it won't look nice on a wall or around a mirror. Instead, choose fairy lights whose wire matches the item you are hanging them from. For example, if you are hanging fairy lights from a white wall, choose ones that have a white wire. If you can't find any, try fairy lights with silver or gold wire; avoid the green wire seen on most Christmas lights."

Use clear, self-adhesive wall hooks (i.e. Command hooks) on walls, mirrors, shelves, and items you do not want to ruin. Use nails or thumb tacks for all other items, including outdoors. Match the color of the nail or thumb tack to the color of the wire. Drive the nails or thumb tacks between the twisted wires. Never drive them through the wires."

    "Buy 2 strands of standard fairy lights and 2 strands of ornamental fairy lights.",
    "Hang the lights on your exterior wall in rows, alternating between fairy lights and ornamental fairy lights.",
    "You can pull the lights taut to create straight lines, or give them some slack to create swooping drapes.",
    "Examples of ornamental lights include orbs, bells, lanterns, pinecones, and other interesting shapes.",
    "Standard fairy lights are the incandescent ones that look like Christmas lights."
