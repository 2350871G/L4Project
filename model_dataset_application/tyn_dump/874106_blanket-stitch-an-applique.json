You can find this type of thread in the embroidery section of a craft supply store. Choose embroidery floss in a color that will complement your applique. For example, if you are sewing a red applique onto a piece of white fabric, then you might want to go with black embroidery floss to add contrast, or you could use red embroidery floss to match your applique. A heavyweight size 12 cotton thread will also work well for blanket stitching an applique. You do not have to separate out the strands if you choose this type of thread."

Hold the size 24 embroidery needle in your non-dominant hand so that the eye is facing up. Hold the freshly cut end of the thread in your dominant hand. Insert the ends into the eye and pull the thread until about 1/3 of it is through the eye. Then, tie a knot in the end of the longer side of the thread. If you are having trouble threading the needle, wet the ends of the thread with a bit of water or saliva. This will stiffen them and make it easier to push the ends through."

Insert the pins through the applique about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edges so that they will not get in the way of your stitches. You may only need 1 pin to hold a small applique in place while you sew, or you might need several to keep a large applique in place.
