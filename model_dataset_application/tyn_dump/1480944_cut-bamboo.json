If it\u2019s cold outside, you will want to heat the bamboo stalks so they won\u2019t split. Put masking tape where you are going to cut. It can stop the wood from splintering. Use a sharp pruner to cut bamboo that is less than 1-inch in diameter. If it\u2019s more than that, you should use a sharp handsaw. Pick one with straight teeth or it will tear the plant\u2019s fibers. Use your measuring tape, or formal project plans, to determine how wide a piece of bamboo you need. Find bamboo of approximately that thickness, understanding that bamboo does not come in uniform diameters."

That\u2019s the purpose they serve to the plant. The number of nodes may differ, depending on the type of bamboo. You can find nodes by looking for areas that have two rings positioned closely together. The lower ring of the node is called the sheath ring, and the upper one is called the stem ring. Most bamboo is hollow inside. The thickness of the wall differs depending on the species of bamboo. One bamboo species is almost solid."

          "description":"If you\u2019re using small amounts of bamboo for something like a small home decorative project, simply roll a sharp knife through the bamboo stalk. Bamboo can be cut precisely using a fine wood saw or a metal saw. As it is a fibrous material, you should be careful at the end of the cut to avoid splits. Go slow at the end. Take out a relatively sharp knife. Always chop the bamboo diagonally. You can make your cut with shears for bamboo stalks 1 inch (2.54 cm) or less in diameter. For thicker pieces, use a saw. If the project is larger, you\u2019ll need a table and a very sharp handsaw. Position the part you want to cut over the edge and grasp the stalk on the table. Now, simply saw the end of the bamboo off. It\u2019s also possible to drill through bamboo. For pieces thicker than one inch, use a fine toothed saw and a stable work area as well as a way to secure both ends of the bamboo (masking tape works great). Then you secure the two ends to the work space and mark where you want to cut and then... cut it. Consider using a clamp on the workbench to hold the stalk. If you wrap the section of bamboo that goes in the clamp with a towel, this will prevent the clamp from marring the surface of your wood."

Cut at a 45-degree angle, and make sure your knife is sharp enough so the cut is clean and not jagged. Select a joint on the stalk and slice just above it. Take off any leafy shoots from the bottom of the stalks. Don\u2019t forget to water your bamboo stalks, even if you then put them in a decorative vase.

Once they\u2019ve reached the end of that life cycle, it\u2019s a good idea to remove them so new bamboo can grow. You will want to prune the bamboo after the 3rd to 5th growing season. Pruning works best when it\u2019s not the shooting season. To cut down a bamboo stalk completely, most hacksaws should do the trick. Wear safety gear and take great caution when dealing with sharp instruments. Always cut above a node. Start cutting at ground level. Don\u2019t forget to cut the stump down so no one will trip over it. Generally, don\u2019t remove more than one-third of the canes in the grove.

If you already have a bamboo plant in a pot or in the landscape, it's simple to propagate by cutting sections of the stem and replanting them, a method called culm-segment cutting.

You need at least two full internodes in the middle and two half internodes on either end. Internodes are the section between two nodes. Cut a bamboo cane into sections containing two to three nodes, the places along a bamboo cane where the leaves grow from. Use a sharp knife to do this. Look for the bamboo to flair out and have a slight division in it to find a node. Cut as many culm sections for replanting as bamboo plants you want to grow. Each section will grow into a new plant.

The best time to transplant bamboo cuttings is in the fall at the beginning of the rainy season. Take advantage of the wet months to get your bamboo cuttings started. If you plant in spring or summer, keep the culm sections well-watered. Don't let them dry out or the roots are likely to die or simply fail to form. True bamboo is part of a grass family.
