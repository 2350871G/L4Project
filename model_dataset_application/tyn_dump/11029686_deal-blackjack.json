Then, ask another player to place a red cut card anywhere in the middle of the deck. Once they place it, split the deck so the red cut card is on the bottom of one of the stacks. Place the other stack on top to finish the shuffle. The cut card is a solid red card placed in the deck that marks where the cards should be separated during the cut. It's not totally necessary, but it can be helpful when cutting the deck. If you\u2019re playing with a large group, you can combine up to 6 or 8 decks to change the odds of the game.Tip: If you have a card shoe to make it easier to deal, set the cards inside so they\u2019re face-down and easy to pull from the slot."

    "A player can choose to double their bet if they\u2019re confident with their hand.",
    "If they want to double down, wait for them to place their additional bet on the table before dealing them 1 more card.",
    "Lay the card horizontally across the top of their hand to show they cannot hit on that hand anymore.",
    "If the player that doubled down wins against your hand, then they win double the amount of money.",
    "For example, if the player bet 5 chips initially and then won after doubling down, they would win 20 chips from the bank.",
    "Give players the option to \u201csplit\u201d if they were dealt cards with the same value.",
    "When players are dealt the same card, they can choose to separate them into 2 hands.",
    "Move the top card on their hand over and ask them to place another bet equal to the first one on the table.",
    "Deal 1 more face-up card for each hand and play them from left to right.",
    "If a player gets a blackjack on a split hand, they win 1:1 payout rather than 3:2."
