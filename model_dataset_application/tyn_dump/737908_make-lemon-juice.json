If you have a round juicer, push the cut end of the lemon onto the plastic spike in the center. Spin the lemon back and forth while pushing down on it.

You could also add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of water per lemon to dilute the juice. Sugar and water make the juice much easier to drink or cook with, especially if it tastes very tart or acidic. Keep in mind that the juiciest varieties, such as Meyer lemons, already have a unique, sweet taste that could be ruined if you plan on using the juice to flavor food. To avoid changing the juice\u2019s flavor too much, add the sugar or water in small amounts. Taste the juice each time."

    "Put the juice into the refrigerator or freezer until it is cold.",
    "Put the juice into a resealable container labeled with today\u2019s date if you don\u2019t plan on using it right away.",
    "It will last about 3 days in the refrigerator before it starts losing its flavor.",
    "For an alternative storage method, freeze it for up to 4 months.",
    "This kind of juice is basically lemonade with a homemade syrup.",
    "It\u2019s better for drinking than cooking.",
    "Drink or use the juice after it has had a chance to chill.",
    "After mixing in the additional water, you can enjoy the juice as a refreshing drink within about 30 minutes.",
    "For lemon syrup fresh off the stove, use it as soon as you need it for a recipe.",
    "It can be drizzled onto a cake, added to pan-fried fish, or mixed into smoothies and other drinks, for example.",
    "Lemon juice is often used when marinating fish or meat.",
    "The acid causes the food to absorb more flavor.",
    "Selecting and Storing Lemons Choose heavy varieties of lemons to get more juice out of them.",
    "Meyer lemons produce a ton of juice, but Fino, Lapithkiotiki, or Primofiori are a few other options.",
    "Meyer lemons are fairly sweet, so you could choose another type if you want a tart taste.",
    "These varieties are all smaller than regular grocery store lemons but feel heavy for their size.",
    "Pick up the lemons to test their weight.",
    "Set aside the heaviest ones for juice.",
    "Eureka and Lisbon lemons are the regular lemons you will commonly find year-round at stores.",
    "They are larger and paler than Meyer lemons but also very tart.",
    "Add sugar and water to the lemon juice if you want a sweeter flavor.",
    "Pick lemons that feel soft but not mushy.",
    "Hold the lemons and squeeze them gently between your fingers.",
    "Soft lemons already have plenty of juice and will be ready for use as soon as you get home.",
    "The lemons should also have smooth skin with a deep yellow color.",
    "Lemons that feel mushy have already spoiled and should be avoided.",
    "Also, avoid lemons that feel hard or look shriveled.",
    "Lemons with light or green skin tend to be more acidic.",
    "You can use them if you want, but ripe lemons are usually better for juice.",
    "Freeze the lemons until you\u2019re ready to juice them.",
    "Put the lemons into a resealable plastic bag.",
    "Push as much air out of the bag as you can before closing and storing it.",
    "The lemons become much easier to squeeze after they have spent some time in the freezer.",
    "It\u2019s also a good way to save some juicy lemons to use whenever you need them throughout the year.",
    "Lemons don\u2019t spoil in the freezer.",
    "Instead, they dry up over time.",
    "Use them within 3 months for optimum quality.",
    "Thaw the lemons by microwaving them for about 30 seconds.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to use the frozen lemons, take them out of the bag and place them in the microwave.",
    "Heat them at a low setting until they reach room temperature.",
    "Make sure they feel soft to the touch before attempting to juice them.",
    "You could also put the lemons in a bowl of warm water until they feel soft to the touch.",
    "Press and roll the lemons on a cutting board to free more of the juice.",
    "Set the lemons down on a flat surface, then push down on them with a firm amount of pressure.",
    "Move them around like you\u2019re pushing a rolling pin or kneading dough.",
    "Roll each lemon for 1 or 2 minutes until it feels very soft and pliable.",
    "That means the membranes inside the lemons have broken and released juices.",
    "To avoid getting lemon juice on your cutting board, cover it with a paper towel or roll the lemons on a covered countertop instead.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to roll the lemons, you could also puncture them a few times with a sharp knife or peel them.",
    "These options are much messier than rolling them, however.",
    "If you have a citrus juicer, you can skip rolling the lemons.",
    "Juicers are efficient enough to remove all of the juice without the extra help!"
