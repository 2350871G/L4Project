A good rule of thumb to follow is that 1 cup (240 ml) of rice yields about 1 \u20442 cups (350 ml) of rice flour. You can use either white or brown rice, as long as it\u2019s raw and uncooked. White vs. Brown Rice\nBetter for baking: Brown. It has a slightly nutty and sweet taste. Cheaper: White. Brown rice is considered a premium product so it costs more. More nutritious: Brown. It contains bran, which is stripped from white rice. That gives brown rice more protein and fiber. Lasts longer: White. The oil in brown rice causes it to go bad faster. Lighter food: White. Brown rice flour tends to be denser, making heavier baked goods."
