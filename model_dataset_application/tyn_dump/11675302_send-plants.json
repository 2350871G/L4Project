          "description":"Use a small trowel to dig around the roots of the plant and separate them from the bulk of the soil. Grab the plant as close to the surface of the soil as you can, being careful not to damage its foliage, and gently pull it up out of the soil.If you aren\u2019t sure where to dig around the roots, start at least 3 in (7.6 cm) away from the base of the stem for small plants and at least 6 in (15 cm) away from the base of the stem for larger plants. If you hit roots when you start digging, move out further away from the stem. Try to keep the root ball as intact and undamaged as possible."

          "description":"Hold the stem firmly by its stem and shake it hard enough that any dirt clinging to the roots starts to fall off. Keep shaking it until most of the loose dirt is gone.Shipping plants bare-root is preferable to shipping potted plants because you don\u2019t have to pay for the weight of the pots and soil. It\u2019s also safer for the plants because there are no heavy pots or chunks of dirt that can move around and damage the plants."

Wrap the moist paper towels tightly around the roots of the plant so that the roots are completely covered.Warning: Make sure you only wrap the roots when shipping plants and not the stems or foliage. Prolonged contact with moisture can cause other parts of the plant to die. This will give the plant enough water to survive during shipping. You can use this same technique to send cuttings of plants by wrapping the base of the cutting in damp paper towels."

Try to seal whatever plastic you use as tightly as possible to contain the moisture and keep it from drying up or spreading to other parts of the plant.Make sure you completely cover the moist paper towels, but avoid wrapping any of the stem or foliage. If you wrap any of the leaves by accident, they can accumulate condensation and rot or steam to death in hot climates."

Carefully roll up the newspaper into a tight cone around the plant and secure it with a piece of tape. Fold the top of the cone down and tape it shut.Think about how florists wrap bouquets of flowers in cones of plastic and tissue paper. Wrap the newspaper around the stem and foliage of the plant in a similar manner to protect it."
