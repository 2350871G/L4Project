      "headline":"Place a sliver of wood inside of the knob.",
      "description":"Fit the wood sliver as far down as it will go into the knob/pull and break the end off. Make sure the break is flush so that no extra wood or plastic is sticking out. You do not need to fill the hole completely (there can be room on either side). You just want to be able to give the screw traction. For drawer handles with two attachments, place it in the hole(s) that need more traction."

    {
      "headline":"Thread the knob back onto cabinet, closet or drawer.",
      "description":"You will need to apply firm pressure while being careful not to over-tighten because you will now have the resistance needed to keep the handle firmly on the door/drawer. Tighten the screw until the knob is flush with the door/drawer. If you twist the knob, you run the risk of stripping the paint off the drawer, so use a screwdriver instead. If the screw sinks into the drawer, use a small washer to shimmy it up."
