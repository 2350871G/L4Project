You can substitute sal de gusano with salt and ground dried chile peppers, but remember that the taste may vary slightly from the sal de gusano. Enjoy it neat and at room temperature. The best way to drink mezcal straight is without ice. Serving mezcal straight at room temperature is the best way to experience its colorful flavors and aromas. Take a sip and swish it around in your mouth. This will open your palate and allow your taste buds to adjust to the initial burning sensation. To experience more flavor, bite into the orange garnish right after taking a sip of mezcal. Mezcal is meant to be enjoyed slowly and should not be taken as a shot.
