  "text":" Cutting the Stem Cut a 4 inch (10 cm) section off a stem just below the root node. The root nodes are the small brown nodes on the golden pothos\u2019 stems. Try to find a 4 inch (10 cm) section of stem that is healthy and has at least 3 leaves on it. Use pruning shears or a sharp knife to cut the stem. Avoid propagating with stems that are wilted or brown. Pull the leaves off the bottom 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the stem you cut off. You want to take the leaves off the bottom so they\u2019re not in the way when you plant the stem. Dip the stem in a rooting hormone if you want it to root faster. Rooting hormones are gels or powders that help plants grow roots faster. You can still propagate your golden pothos stem without a rooting hormone, but it may take longer to root. Put the stem in water if you want the roots to grow before you pot it. Golden pothos can be rooted in both water and soil. If you decide to root the stem in water, fill a jar with enough water to cover the base of the stem. Put the stem in the jar and place it somewhere that gets indirect sunlight. Wait about a month for the roots to form. Then, transfer the rooted stem to soil. Potting and Watering the Stem Fill a small pot with 1 part peat moss and 1 part coarse sand. You can also use perlite instead of sand. The sand or perlite will give the soil good drainage, which will help prevent your new golden pothos from getting root rot. Use a pot that has drainage holes in the bottom. Make a thin hole in the soil and place the root node end of the stem in it. Make the hole deep enough that the bottom 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the stem is covered with soil. Gently fill the hole in with soil without packing it down. Water the stem immediately so the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil is wet. Don\u2019t soak the soil or leave the stem sitting in a lot of water. If water drains out of the drainage holes into the tray underneath, remove the tray and empty out the water. Keep the soil moist until you see new growth. New growth is a sign that the roots are established. Check on the soil every day. If it looks dry, lightly water the stem. It could take up to a month for the roots on your new golden pothos to get established in the soil. Let the soil dry out between waterings once the roots are established. Don\u2019t overwater your new golden pothos or the leaves could turn yellow and die. If you see signs of overwatering, water your golden pothos less frequently.",
