By doing this, you keep the green tops of the parsnip in a healthy state. You also remove some of the dirt from the vegetable itself. If you don't have a bowl large enough, use a large pot or pan."

Run the parsnips under some cold water and use your fingers to scrub the dirt away from the surface of the parsnips. You probably won't be able to get rid of all the dirt by doing this. Even if you do, your parsnips are not fully clean, so don't skip ahead in the process."

Don't worry if you start scratching the surface of the parsnips. Once the parsnips don't start peeling from the friction, you can keep scrubbing with the same amount of pressure. Don't use a nail brush that you've used on your nails before. Keep the nail brush for scrubbing your parsnips in future."

Small, thin strips down the root of the parsnip will do. If the core of the parsnip feels very fibrous, use your knife to slice it off."

With this device, you place your parsnip on a grid with 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares and push down on the lid to dice the parsnip. If you don't have a vegetable dicer, use a sharp knife. You don't have to cut exactly 1 in (2.5 cm) cubes with the knife. Just try to cut them close to this size. You can cut your cubes bigger or smaller than this.

Transfer the cubes of parsnip to the bowl as soon as you can after removing them from the boiling water. Your parsnips will have just been starting to cook in the pot of water.

If you used a vacuum-packed bag, leave your parsnips in the freezer for up to 14 months. If you don't want the parsnips to freeze together in the freezer, tray freeze them first. Place them apart from each other on a tray in the freezer. Then when they've frozen, place them into the vacuum-packed bags. Freezing parsnips could cause a slight change in texture and taste.
