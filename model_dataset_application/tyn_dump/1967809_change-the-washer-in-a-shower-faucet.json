  "text":" Turn off the water at the nearest water valve. If you are unable to locate a close valve, shut off the water at its main source where it enters the house. Look on the sides of the faucet handles for a small screw. It is usually at the base of the handle, near the escutcheon or decorative portion. It may be beneath or on the underside of the faucet handle. Use a screwdriver to remove this screw and set it aside.  Lift the faucet handle off of the escutcheon and set it aside.  Look for the screws holding the escutcheon to the wall. They are usually hidden by the handle; once the handle has come off, they should be easily seen. Remove the screws holding the escutcheon to the wall.  Take off the escutcheon and set it aside. This will expose the faucet cartridge. Grasp the cartridge with a pair of pliers.  Turn the cartridge with the pliers counterclockwise until it comes loose and slips out of the wall.  Turn the cartridge upside down to see the washer at its base.  Remove the old washer from the cartridge by using a screwdriver to loosen the screw holding it in place. Grasp the cartridge with the pliers to help it loosen, if you are having difficulty. Slip the new washer into the place left by the old one.  Insert the end of the cartridge into the wall.  Grasp the end of the cartridge with the pliers.  Twist the pliers clockwise to lock the cartridge back into place.  Set the escutcheon back over the cartridge.  Screw the escutcheon back into place.  Screw the handle back onto the escutcheon.
