An 8.5-gallon (32 L) fermenter will be large enough for this process. Wash and mash up the tomatoes. While the equipment is being sanitized, clean and mash up your tomatoes.

You can experiment with any type of red tomato you\u2019d like. Sweeter varieties, Sungold and Super 100, are ideal for this recipe. Combine the ingredients except for yeast. Pour all of the ingredients into the primary fermenter (including 2 campden tablets), except for the yeast. Add one gallon (3.87 L) of water on top of the ingredients.

Do not touch it during this time. This allows the campden tablets to dissolve and kill existing yeast. It also allows the tomatoes to begin to break down. Fermenting the Wine Add the yeast. After 24 hours, pour half of a package of yeast into the primary fermenter. You do not have to mix it in. Put the lid back on the fermenter, and make sure it has an airlock. You will begin to see bubbles forming after about 12 hours. Place the fermenter in a cool, dry location. The fermenter should not be exposed to too much heat, light, or humidity. A basement or storage closet would be a good place to store the jugs. Have someone help you move the fermenter if it is too heavy to move on your own.

Do not touch it for another 12 hours. After the 24 hours, you will be ready to push down the fruit that has risen to the top. Push down the fruit several times each day. Fruit floats to the top during the fermentation process. This is a problem because massive air bubbles could form underneath the fruit if it is not pushed down. Use a sanitized spoon to push down the fruit a few times a day. This is called \u201cpunching the cap.\u201d Make the lid is put on tightly when you are done. Strain the solids after 5 to 7 days.

Your wine should begin to clear up after 4 or 5 days. After 95 days, your wine should be clear and not murky at all. Your wine is ready for bottling once it is clear. Bottling the Wine Take out 5 empty wine bottles. This recipe produces enough wine to fill 5 25-ounce (750 mL) wine bottles. Clean and sterilize 5 empty win bottles. Allow them to dry before filling them with wine. Rack the wine  into each bottle. To rack the wine, you will need a siphon and carboy.

Allow the corks to sit in the water for 5 minutes. Then, remove the corks and allow them to drain for a few minutes. Cork the bottles. Use a corker to put the corks into the wine bottles. A corker can be bought or rented at most homebrew stores. To use, place the filled wine bottle into the corker. Put the cork into the bottle opening, and pull the lever (or levers if you\u2019re using a double levered corker) to slide the cork into the bottle. Repeat with each bottle.
