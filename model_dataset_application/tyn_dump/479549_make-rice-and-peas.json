To drain the liquid from the beans, you can hold the top of the can that you\u2019ve removed across the opening so only the liquid falls out when you tip it over or place a small wire strainer over the opening as you pour. Use a measuring cup that is at least 4 cups (946 ml) in size, so it can hold all of the liquid that you'll need for the recipe. You can use dried kidney beans for the rice and peas recipe, but you must soak them overnight in water before using them. You\u2019ll also need to add more water to the coconut milk so you have 4 cups (946 ml) of liquid when you\u2019re cooking the rice."
