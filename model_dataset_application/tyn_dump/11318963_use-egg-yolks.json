Using milk in your egg wash mixture will give it a creamier texture and make your wash stick to uneven surfaces more easily.

You can use your egg wash to give a golden brown shine, stick 2 pieces of dough together, or make the outside of your baked goods crispy. You can buy a pastry brush online or at any home goods store. Bake your dough according to instructions. Each pastry, bread, or pie has a different baking time, so you should bake yours for however long the recipe specifies. The egg wash will turn your dough a deeper brown than they normally would have been, so make sure that it is baked all the way through. Creating a Custard Boil milk and sugar together in a large pot. Combine 1.6 cups (380 mL) of milk and \u00bc cup (50 g) of sugar by boiling them on the stove. Once your mixture reaches boiling, you can reduce the heat and keep it simmering. You\u2019ll want to keep this mixture warm so that it combines well with the other ingredients. Whisk 4 egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch together.

Make sure that the cornstarch is completely folded into the mix, or else your custard could be lumpy. Pour your cornstarch mixture into your milk and sugar mixture.

If you don\u2019t want to use your egg yolks right away, you can store them in an airtight container in your fridge.
