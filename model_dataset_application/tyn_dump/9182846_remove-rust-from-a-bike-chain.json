          "description":"It\u2019s unlikely that a kickstand will be stable enough to keep your bike upright while removing rust from the chain. Instead, hang your bike on a rack or turn it upside down so it rests sturdily on the seat and handlebars. If you have a nice bike, you may want to lay a drop cloth in between your bike and the ground so you don't scratch its paint job. Bike racks are relatively easy to make from scrap parts. Make a stable frame equipped with hooks and hang your bike by its wheels. Hanging your bike in a rack or turning it upside down has the added bonus of making the chain more accessible as you work on it."

Surface rust, buildup, and crustiness can all be removed so your chain runs like new. To ensure the longest life and best operation of bike chains, avid cyclists should clean their chain once a week or roughly once every 200 miles (321 km). Keeping your chain cleaned and lubed will help maintain the condition of your chain and drivetrain. It will also help you notice damaged links sooner.

Jonas Jackel\t\t\tOwner, Huckleberry Bicycles\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: Measure the chain to determine when it's time to replace it. As the chain on your bike wears out, it gets longer, because there's more play around the rivets and rollers holding the chain together. Then, as the chain stretches and changes its shape, it will start to wear that different shape into the gears on your bike, so you'll have to replace the whole drivetrain if you wait too long to get a new chain."
