Identifying Where to Prune Ninebark Remove dead and damaged branches and shoots. Check the ninebark for any branches that have died or that are broken during your maintenance pruning. Cut these down to the ground or as close to the connecting branch as you can. Don\u2019t cut the branches down to stubs. Remove them completely.
