          "description":"Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl, stirring gently only to dissolve the yeast. The water should be between 110 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (43 and 46 degrees Celsius) in order to activate the yeast properly. Use a food thermometer to check the temperature of the water before you add the yeast."

You could use an electric mixer set to low speed instead of a mixing spoon, if desired. Make sure to beat the egg slightly with a fork to combine the yolk and white before adding it to the mixture. Use softened butter. To soften butter, let it sit out at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes. You could also soften butter by microwaving it for 15 seconds at 30 percent power."

          "description":"Gradually add the all-purpose flour to the mix, stopping once a soft dough forms. If you have a stand mixer with a dough attachment, you can use it to fold the flour into the dough. If not, you will need to use a mixing spoon or your hands. Do not use an electric hand mixer."

          "headline":"Knead the dough.",
          "description":"Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead until it becomes smooth an elastic. This usually takes about 10 minutes. If the dough sticks to your hands as you knead it, you can apply a light dusting of flour to your hands to help prevent further sticking."

You can grease the bowl with nonstick cooking spray, butter, or shortening. Turn the dough after putting it into the greased bowl once in order to grease the top. Make sure that the dough is placed in a warm area. Otherwise, it may not reach its full rising potential. Cover the bowl with a lid or warm, moist towel."

          "description":"After the dough rises, punch it down and separate it into three equal pieces. Allow those three pieces to rest for 5 minutes, regaining some volume in the process. This might be a good time to preheat your oven. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and prepare a baking sheet by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray or greasing it with butter or shortening."

Transfer these round pieces of dough to your prepared baking sheet and let rise for another 30 minutes, or until doubled in volume. If you do not have a biscuit cutter, you could also use a cookie cutter or the open rim of a glass. Choose a glass with a fairly sharp, well-defined rim in order to create even circles."

The crumbs should be about the size of a pea. If you do not have a pastry blender, you could cut the butter into the flour mixture by using two knives to stir and chop the butter while immersed in the flour mixture."

At this point, the dough should be about 3/4 inch (2 cm) thick. Fold the dough into three sections in order to create biscuits that have multiple, flaky layers.

Place the biscuits onto your prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. A cookie cutter or the mouth of a glass could be used in the absence of an actual biscuit cutter. After your first batch of biscuits has been cut out, pat the scraps together again so that you can cut out more biscuits from the remaining dough. Continue until all the dough has been used. While circular biscuits are the most traditional shape, you could cut your biscuits into any shape desired. Cutting the biscuits into squares will prevent you from having to roll out any excess dough. Alternatively, create drop biscuits by dropping rounded tablespoons of dough onto your baking sheet.
