This will allow you to hang your snowflake securely indoors or outdoors. You can find a hanger at your local hardware store. Making a Craft Stick Snowflake Glue the craft sticks together. Squirt a dollop of glue in the middle of a craft stick. Then, place another stick on top of the glue, keeping it perpendicular with the first stick to make a cross. Repeat this process to make the second cross. Finally, glue the two crosses together, placing one stick cross at a 45-degree angle on top of the other cross. Give the snowflake a few minutes to dry. You can find craft sticks and glue at your local crafts store. Add the fake snow. Once the craft sticks have securely attached to each other, cover the entire snowflake in glue. Then pour some fake snow into a paper plate and place the glue-covered snowflake in it. Once one side is covered in fake snow, flip it over and cover the other side. You should be able to find fake snow at your local craft store. If not, you can shred some white tissue paper or paint the snowflake white. Hang the snowflake. After the glue has dried, wrap one end of a white pipe cleaner around the top of one of the sticks. Then create a loop and wrap the remaining cleaner around the stick. Tie a piece of string or thread to the loop and hang it wherever you would like. Crafting a Clothespin Snowflake Take apart the clothespins. Carefully remove the metal spring from eight wooden clothespins. Try not to break the wooden part of the clothespin. Make sure that the clothespins are the same size and shape. It may be a good idea to have a few spare clothespins in case you break some. Stick the backs of the clothespins together. With some hot glue, attach the flat sides of the clothespins together. For one pair, fold a piece of ribbon in half and insert the ends between two halves before you glue them together. This will give you something to hang the snowflake from. Be careful not to burn yourself when working with hot glue. Glue together the snowflake. Take four of the glued together clothespins and glue them together at the front, aligning their flattened edges to form a cross. Repeat this process with the four remaining pieces. Finally, glue the two crosses together, placing one clothespin cross at a 45-degree angle on top of the other. Decorate the snowflake. Paint the snowflake with white, silver, or gold paint. Sprinkle glitter onto the wet paint to add a little sparkle. You can also glue on some sequins to add extra pizzazz. You can find paint, glitter, and sequins at your local craft store.",
