Turn your garment you want to adjust inside out and fold in half down the front from the neck to the hemline. This fold should follow the centre front. Make sure it's straight. Mark the measurement for Top of the Shoulder to Apex on the garment using white chalk (Coloured chalk may stain clothing). Measure down from the Top of the Shoulder, parallel to the centre front of the garment and place your chalk mark. Divide the Apex to Apex measurement in half.  Measuring in from the centre of your garment, mark half of the Apex to Apex measurement along the same axis as your previous mark. Now you should have a \"+\" or \"X\" marking on your garment. That \"+\" or \"X\" marks the exact spot of your Apex. This is where your Princess seam will start from. From your Apex, draw a line down, towards the hem and parallel to the centre front, through your Ribcage, Waist, Upper Hip, and Mid Hip (also the Lower Hip if you want to adjust your garment through the widest part of your rear end). This is the line that the Princess seam will follow. Go over this line with more chalk making sure the line has quite a bit of chalk on it. If you've used white chalk it will easily wash out. Unfold your garment.  Transfer the chalk line from side of the front to the other by folding your garment in half along the same centre front line, this time folding the other way. The Front side of the garment should be folded in half with each half facing each other so the chalk line can transfer properly. The side seams of the garment should match up. Lay the garment flat on a table and gently hit the chalk line. This helps the chalk transfer. Unfold the garment again. You should see two lines down the front of your garment that are exactly the same. If they are not the you should rub out one of the chalk lines and try again. Put the garment on inside out. With the two lines on the front side, so you can look down your stomach and see them. Pin the garments so that you are dividing the extra fabric evenly between the 2 Princess seams. Try to shape the seams so that they taper with the most fabric being taken in around the Waist and the least at the ends of the seams (Apex and Mid Hip). You will want the seam to taper smoothly at the ends to the flat, open fabric. Take the garment off and double check to make sure the seams look even. If not, adjust and try your garment on again. Sew along the lines you just pinned.  Try your garment on again, this time right side out. If everything fits then you're done. If not, stitch rip the seams and try again.",
