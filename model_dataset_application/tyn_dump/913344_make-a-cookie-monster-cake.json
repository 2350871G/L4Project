  "text":" Baking the Chocolate Cake Gather your ingredients and supplies. With this recipe, you'll use frosting and a few simple decorations to turn a regular cake into an amazing cookie monster cake. Before baking your cake, preheat the oven to 350 F (177 C). Along with your ingredients, you'll also need your materials. Combine the dry ingredients. Sift together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the large mixing bowl. Sifting the dry ingredients will remove lumps, and help the batter come together more easily. The less stirring and beating you do with the batter, the lighter and fluffier the cake will be. Over mixing flour develops the gluten, and this can make a cake dense and heavy. Pour in the wet ingredients. To the dry ingredients, add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Beat on medium speed with the electric beaters for about two minutes. Then carefully add the boiling water and whisk everything for an additional minute. You can use a whisk instead of electric beaters to combine all the ingredients, but be sure to whisk vigorously to combine everything properly. If you're using a stand mixer instead, use the paddle attachment to make the batter. Fill the cake pans. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. The batter will be quite thin and runny, so be careful not to pour too quickly. Bake the cakes. Place the cakes in the oven and bake them for 30 to 35 minutes. They are ready when you insert a toothpick into the center of the cake and it comes out clean. Set the cakes aside to cool for 10 minutes after they come out of the oven. Cool the cakes. After 10 minutes, transfer the cakes to the wire cooling racks and remove the cake pans. Let the cakes cool completely before adding frosting or decorations. Making the Frosting Cream the butter. Add the butter to your medium mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Use electric beaters or the paddle attachment to cream the butter on medium speed for about two minutes. When the butter is ready, it will be smooth, creamy, and free of lumps. Add the sugar and the remaining ingredients. Turn the mixer to low speed.

Leave 2\u00bc cups of frosting in the original mixing bowl for the blue frosting. Measure out 1 cup of frosting for the white filling, and \u00be cup of frosting for the black mouth. Add the food coloring. To make the blue fur frosting, start by adding 10 drops of blue food coloring to the large portion of frosting. Whisk in the color to fully combine.

Place one of the cakes onto a cake plate or serving platter so that you don\u2019t have to move it after assembly. Spread a generous layer of white cookie crumble frosting on the top of the cake. Carefully lay the second cake on top to create a double layered cake. Use a large spatula to move the top cake onto the bottom layer. Ice the cake with blue frosting. To help make the cookie monster fur fuller and more vibrant, coat the entire outside of the cake with a generous layer of blue frosting.

Before serving the cake, break up the remaining chocolate chip cookies and sprinkle the crumbs and chunks around the cake on the serving plate. Finished. ",
