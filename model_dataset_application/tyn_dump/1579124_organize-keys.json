You can also make your own simple keychain with a zip tie. Don\u2019t enjoy bulky, noisy keys? Look for a speciality key system that will store your keys compactly and without any noises. If you\u2019re feeling crafty, make a key storage system yourself by removing the tops of keys and storing them in a swiss army knife.
