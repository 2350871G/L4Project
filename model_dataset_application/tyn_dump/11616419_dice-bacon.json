Avoid freezing the bacon until it's completely solid since this could dull your knives. If you don't want to dice an entire package of bacon, freeze as many strips as you'd like to dice.

Using a sharp knife makes it easier to slice through the bacon and can prevent you from accidentally cutting yourself.
