  "text":" Gathering Milk Thistle Plan to harvest the milk thistle in the fall. Pay attention to when the flowers start to dry out. In the fall you should begin to see white or silver seeds appear near the tops of the milk thistle. To make it easier to harvest, wait until the milk thistle blossoms are dry. Put on protective clothing and gloves. Since the leaves and spines of the plant are sharp and prickly, wear long sleeves and pants that will protect your skin. Wear thick, sturdy gloves that will keep the prickles from poking you. Keep in mind that milk thistle can still penetrate the gloves if you don't handle the plant carefully. Cut the head of the milk thistle from the stalk. Take sharp scissors or pruning shears and cut the head. Leave about 2 in (5 cm) of the stalk so it's easier to hold the milk thistle. Harvest as many milk thistle heads as you like. Put the heads in a paper bag and dry them for 5 to 7 days. To harvest the milk thistle seeds, place all of the heads in a paper bag and put it in a warm place. This will help the seeds dry completely. For example, put the bag of milk thistle heads in your garage or a room in your house that gets lots of sunshine and warmth. Separate the seeds from the chaff. Once the seeds are dry, transfer them to a burlap or rough canvas sack. Shake the bag and push down a little so the seeds loosen from the heads.
