When you first try this method, you might want to use slightly shorter cooking times and check the potatoes (unfold the foil with tongs; the steam will be hot enough to burn). If they are not fully cooked, rewrap them and grill for a few more minutes. If they're too charred but not done in the middle, put them back on, away from the hottest part of the grill, and cover the grill. The amount of heat and the size of the potatoes determine their cooking time. Generally, when grilled with the lid down, whole foil wrapped potatoes take 30 to 45 minutes to cook through. In the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, you can remove the potatoes from the foil and return them to the grill, unwrapped. This will brown the skins."

  "text":" Grilling Whole Potatoes Wrapped in Foil Wash the potatoes. Run each potato under cool water and use your hands or a soft sponge to scrub it clean of dirt. Prepare each potato. Using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler, remove any blemishes or green spots. Pat the potatoes dry. Dry potato skins absorb oil, butter and seasonings better, making the potatoes more flavorful. Poke holes in the potatoes. Before wrapping your potatoes in foil, use a fork to poke a few holes across the skin. This allows the heat to vent from the potatoes for even cooking. Wrap your potato in aluminum foil. Tear off sheets of foil for all the potatoes you plan to cook and wrap them tightly in the foil. Be sure the potatoes are covered completely. You can roll them in the foil and pinch the sides closed or fold the foil over them and fold the sides. Place your potatoes on the grill. Turn on your grill and adjust the heat to high.

Placing your potatoes on skewers makes the grilling process easier. Place 3 to 4 potatoes on each skewer depending on size. You can also place your potatoes directly onto the grill if you prefer. Put your potatoes on the grill. Using indirect heat, place the skewered potatoes on the edge furthest from the direct heat source. Cook your potatoes. Cook over the indirect heat for 30 to 40 minutes with the grill lid down. Gradually roll the potatoes toward the direct heat. Cooking Wedges or Potato Slices Wash your potatoes.
