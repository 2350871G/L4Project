A ripe papaya will have a yellow-orange color all around and a sweet fragrance coming from the stem at the top. You should be able to press the skin in a little with your finger, but it should still be relatively firm. If your papaya is not yet ripe, you may try putting it in a brown paper bag on a room temperature kitchen shelf, next to bananas. This tends to quicken the ripening process by a day or two. If the fragrance is overpowering and/or the skin is too soft, the papaya is overripe, and you should discard it."
