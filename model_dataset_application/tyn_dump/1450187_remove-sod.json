Grasses with deep roots will be harder to remove that grasses with shallow roots. For example, if your grass has deep roots, then you will need to make extra sure that you kill the roots or the grass may grow back later."

Do this by watering your unwanted sod a few days before you start removal. If you over water, the soil may become muddy. Muddy soil is very difficult to work with a shovel. Only water your sod until the soil is moist. Test your soil so see how much moisture is in it by sticking your shovel into the sod you wish to remove and wiggling it back and forth to make a small, narrow hole. Then gauge soil dryness with a touch test."

Your strips of sod should be roughly 1-foot-wide (30 cm) each and approximately 3 feet (0.91 m) in length (91 cm). Sod is almost like carpet. The roots of the grass weave together to form a thin layer of greenery on the top of the soil. When cut into strips, you can roll up sod for easier handling. Strips that are larger than one foot wide may be too cumbersome for you to handle without help, even if rolled up carpet style. Sod is very heavy. Even if you've cut your sod into manageable segments, you may need someone's help to move it. You may also want to keep some pallets handy to put the removed sod onto and then either hire someone to pick them up or get a few people to help you load the pallets into a truck to take them away. You only need to break through the top layer of sod with a shovel, spade, or edger to prepare your sod for removal. You don't need to dig especially deep."

After this sod is cut, it can be pulled free of the ground and disposed of. The smaller squares of sod will be easier to handle and can be stacked in a truck, trailer, or wheelbarrow, one on top of another."

Set the depth gauge of the tines to a shallow setting for your first few passes. Then, go back and rake out any rocks and hard dirt clods. After you have removed these, then you can re-set the depth gauge of your tiller by no more than a couple of notches. Then, go over the areas again to re-till deeper. Keep going through this process until you achieve the desired depth. Follow the use and care instructions for your tiller for best results. These kinds of machines can be dangerous if used incorrectly. Keep all children, pets, and people out of the area while you are tilling. Getting caught in the tiller can cause severe bodily injury or death. Keep loose clothing and body parts, like your hands and feet, away from the blades of your tiller when it is running.
