To defrost the ground turkey in the refrigerator, place it in the refrigerator 24 hours before you plan to cook it. You could also remove the ground turkey from its packaging and place it in a microwave-safe dish. Use the defrost setting on your microwave for the specific weight of ground turkey you want to defrost. To prevent food spoilage, you'll need to brown the ground turkey immediately after you've defrosted it in the microwave. If you don't have time to defrost the meat, you can safely cook it straight from frozen. It will just take more time to brown and be more difficult to stir."
