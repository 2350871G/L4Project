A good rule of thumb is to use about 1 US quart (0.95 L) for every \u20442 pound (230 g) of noodles. If you don\u2019t have a measuring cup, run enough water into your pot to cover your noodles completely. It\u2019s important that they submerged in order for them to cook properly."

Once it reaches a constant yet gentle bubble, you\u2019ll be ready to add your noodles.

This will be especially useful if you\u2019re working with fresh, doughy handmade noodles. As an added bonus, oil and salt will both impart a little extra flavor to your boiling water. Any type of oil will do the trick, but a mild variety like olive, vegetable, or canola will provide the best results. Avoid adding more than \u00bd a teaspoon of oil to 6 ounces (170 g) of noodles. Doing so could leave your noodles overly greasy and make it harder for sauce to stick later on."
