And you need a cloth that will clean the earrings gently. All you need is a toothbrush, but pick one with soft bristles. Make sure you don\u2019t use a wire brush or a brush with harsh bristles, as this could damage the setting. A child\u2019s toothbrush would be a good choice because the bristles are really soft. You can also buy brushes specially designed for cleaning jewelry online or in stores. Don't fall for the tip that you should use toothbrush to clean the jewelry, though. It can be too abrasive. There are better household products to use. Use a microfiber hand towel to dry the earrings. These are softer and will help you clean the earrings gently. You also want to make sure you only use soft bristles on earrings with gold settings. If your diamond has a fragile setting or is an antique, you might want to skip the brush completely."

          "description":"If you don\u2019t have a jewelry cleaning kit, you can make your own solutions with many different home cleaning products. You can use regular dish soap to clean the dirt and oils off diamond earrings. Mix together 1 cup of lukewarm water with 1 teaspoon of mild dish soap. Stir the water with your fingers until you see bubbles. Make sure the dish soap doesn\u2019t have perfume or dye in it or it could damage the earrings. Soak the earrings for three to four minutes, so that any dirt or oil loosens up. Then take a soft toothbrush and wet it in the mixture. Softly brush the diamonds. Let the earrings soak another 1-2 minutes. Then remove the earrings, and place them on a paper towel. Take a bowl of clear water and rinse the earrings off. Don\u2019t rinse them under a faucet or you might lose them down the drain.

Cleaning the top of the stones is definitely necessary, but the most important thing to remember is that you need to clean the pavilion, or the underside of the stones. Well-made jewelry always has holes in the back of the setting that allows you to clean the belly of the stones. If your jewelry doesn't have that, take it to a professional jeweler for cleaning."

Another technique involves using a denture tablet to give your diamonds some sparkle. Put the tablet into a cup of water, and then put your diamond earrings into the cup for several minutes.

    "Soak your earrings in vodka if no other materials are around.",
    "Fill a shot glass with vodka.",
    "Drop your earrings into the glass and let them soak for a minute or two.",
    "Remove the earrings and rinse under warm water.",
    "Dry and polish them with a lint free cloth.",
    "Protecting your Diamond Earrings Don\u2019t wear diamond earrings all the time.",
    "It\u2019s easier to clean diamond earrings if you don\u2019t get them very dirty in the first place.",
    "So, it\u2019s a good idea to remove them for activities that could dirty them such as going to the beach, playing sports, gardening, and even washing dishes.",
    "Keep diamond earrings away from chlorine bleach.",
    "It can cause them damage.",
    "Natural oils can leave a coating on diamond jewelry that needs removing to restore the earrings to their proper brilliance.",
    "Contact with skin, lotions, powders, and soaps can leave such a film.",
    "Put your earrings on last, after you style your hair and put on perfume and lotion.",
    "All of these products can damage the earrings, so reduce the exposure.",
    "Properly store your earrings.",
    "Diamond earrings will incur less wear and tear if you store them properly.",
    "That means you shouldn\u2019t just toss them in a drawer.",
    "Diamonds are almost impossible to scratch \u2013 unless it\u2019s with another diamond.",
    "Thus, you shouldn\u2019t store them right next to each other because the diamonds can scratch each other.",
    "Avoid touching the earrings too much.",
    "The hands contain body oils that can turn diamonds dull.",
    "Insure them.",
    "Sometimes your home owner\u2019s or rental insurance will cover lost or stolen jewelry.",
    "Check your policy.",
    "If they aren\u2019t covered, it might be a good idea to change your policies to cover the earrings.",
    "Whether this is worth it depends on how much the earrings cost, of course, or whether they have great sentimental value.",
    "Do your homework, and compare different companies before choosing an insurance plan.",
    "Remember to check the deductible.",
    "Get your earrings checked.",
    "A certified jeweler will spot flaws in your earrings that you won\u2019t.",
    "So it\u2019s a good idea to get the earrings checked out if you want the diamonds to retain their shine.",
    "You want to make sure that the diamond\u2019s prongs are not loose, or you could lose the diamond.",
    "You should have your diamonds checked out by a certified jeweler once or twice a year.",
    "Consider having your earrings professionally cleaned.",
    "Ask your local jewelers if they offer an ultrasonic or ionic cleaning for diamond jewelry.",
    "Many will only charge a nominal fee for such services.",
    "Search for a jeweler that offers sulfuric acid cleaning if you have extremely dirty diamond earrings that you cannot clean any other way.",
    "Sulfuric acid boils are still relatively inexpensive but cost a little more than ultrasonic cleanings.",
    "They can damage jewelry if not done properly.",
    "Cleaning Gold or Silver Backings Remove tarnish from silver or gold.",
    "To remove tarnish from silver, you can also use household products.",
    "Take \u00bc of a cup of baking soda and mix it with 2 tablespoons of water into a thick paste.",
    "Take a damp sponge, and rub it on the silver, then rinse it, and dry it.",
    "You can also use baking soda to polish gold by covering the gold with a light coating of it.",
    "Then, pour vinegar over it, and rinse it.",
    "You can make gold shine more if you put a little bit of beer on a piece of towel and then rub it over the jewelry.",
    "Believe it or not, but you can also put silver in ketchup to make it brighter.",
    "Put the jewelry in the ketchup only for a few minutes.",
    "Use baking soda.",
    "This will remove built-up tarnish on earrings with silver backings or to polish earrings with gold backings.",
    "For silver earrings, combine 1/4 of cup baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl.",
    "Dip a damp sponge into the baking soda mixture.",
    "Carefully rub the baking soda mixture on the metal backing of each earring.",
    "Dry and polish the earrings with a lint free cloth.",
    "For gold earrings, cover the backing with a light coating of baking soda.",
    "Carefully pour a small amount of vinegar over the backing.",
    "Rinse clean with water.",
    "Dry and polish the earrings with a lint free cloth."
