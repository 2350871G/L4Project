These come in egg dying kits used during Easter. This little wire contraption has a hole and a handle, making it the perfect wand for blowing bubbles. A pipe cleaner.

Bend the end of the straw into a circle and tape it to the stem of the straw. A slotted spoon. You can dip the spoon in the bubbles solution and blow a lot of tiny bubbles at once.
