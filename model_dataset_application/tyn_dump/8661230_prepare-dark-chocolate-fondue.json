When the cream starts to bubble a little, turn off the heat and whisk in 12 ounces (340 g) of chopped dark chocolate and a pinch of salt. Keep whisking until the chocolate is melted. This fondue is basically a ganache, so it's important to transfer it to a fondue pot. This will keep it smooth enough to dip foods into."
