Flat paint will also hide any imperfections in the ceiling. You will also need to choose a color of paint for your ceiling.

For example, if you\u2019re painting the ceiling in your living room, move sofas, chairs, and tables into your kitchen or bedroom. Moving your furniture may not be possible if you live in a small apartment or have extremely heavy pieces of furniture.

Applying a layer of painter\u2019s tape to the wall beneath the trim will prevent you from accidentally applying paint to the top of your wall.

    "Ask the drywall contractor to do a skim coat to smooth out the ceiling once it\u2019s repaired.",
    "Applying a skim coat to the drywall before you paint will make the ceiling glisten after the coat of paint has been applied.",
    "Roll on a single light coat of paint for textured ceilings.",
    "If your ceiling is textured, gently paint a single layer by making straight top-to-bottom strokes with your roller brush.",
    "Overlap the strokes by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
    "Do this delicately so that you don\u2019t end up knocking the textured material off of your ceiling.",
    "Applying a skim coat to the drywall before you paint will make the ceiling glisten after the coat of paint has been applied.",
    "If you try to paint the textured ceiling on your own and the job goes poorly, call a contractor to repair the paint job.",
    "Find a contractor in your area by searching online.",
    "For example, search for \u201cprofessional painter business near me.\u201d Paint a vaulted ceiling from top to bottom.",
    "Start in an upper corner of the ceiling and work your way down to the wall in straight lines.",
    "Each consecutive line must slightly overlap the previous stroke by at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm).",
    "Be smooth and consistent with all of your strokes so there are no curving roller marks on the wall.",
    "Essentially, you\u2019ll paint your vaulted ceiling as if it were a wall."
