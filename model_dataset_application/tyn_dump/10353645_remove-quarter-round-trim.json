          "description":"The process of removing quarter round trim has the potential to be damaging, so be aware of what condition you would like to leave the floors and baseboards in after removing the trim. Ripping the trim off the wall to quickly could cause the nails to leave larger holes behind in the floor or baseboard, and could also bend or even snap the trim in half. Not using your putty knife gently on the walls could leave scuff marks that may need to be re-touched with paint. If you plan to replace the floors or baseboards, or if you are completing a demolition job, you won\u2019t need to worry as much about the damage.

Gently tap the putty knife in place with the heel of your hand to slide it into the gap. If you cannot slide the putty knife in with your hand alone, try sliding in a piece of mail first and then insert the putty knife between the trim and the mail as a buffer. If this still doesn\u2019t work, you can tap a hammer against the back of your putty knife as it is positioned over the gap."

This doesn\u2019t have to be an aggressive motion, but using increasing force will help if you feel stuck. If there are multiple gaps and the one you are working on seems stuck, move to another gap. Keeping the back-and-forth motion slow will prevent the trim from snapping."

Your goal is to pull out as many of the nails as possible along with the trim so you do not have to go back and remove them from the baseboard or floor. If the trim is nailed into the floor, place the putty knife underneath the trim and continue pulling upward in the same wiggling motion. If the trim is nailed into the baseboard, place the putty knife between the trim and the baseboard and wiggle it as if you are trying to pull the trim toward you and away from the wall. Quarter round trim is usually nailed into the floor unless the floor is tile. Continue this motion across the trim until is has loosened all the way across its length."

If you are less concerned with damage, you can pull more quickly and aggressively. Once the trim is removed, you may see some remaining nails in the wall. These can be removed with pliers or the back of a hammer. The nails used to attach quarter round trim are generally quite long and sharp, so be mindful of this as you completely detach the trim."
