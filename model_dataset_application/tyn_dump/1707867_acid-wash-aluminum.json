          "description":"This step will depend on the size of your piece and the stain you are trying to remove. If you have a stain that covers a large portion of the aluminum, it is often best to soak the piece in the acid for 1 to 2 hours. If you are removing a small stain or do not have a tank big enough for your piece to fit in, you can put your acid on a rag and rub gently back and forth. Do not go in a circular motion, as this can cause the aluminum to look uneven in the finished product."

          "headline":"Scrub lightly with a soft abrasive if needed.",
          "description":"If the stain does not come off easily with just acid, consider using salt or baking soda as a minimal abrasive. You can rub it in with a rag. Put as little force into the scrubbing as possible to minimize scratches on your aluminum surface. Sometimes, steel wool is used as a more serious abrasive. If you feel that you need to do this, you should look for the finest grade of steel wool that you can buy and be very gentle with it. Scratches in your aluminum will allow things to get stuck on even worse in the future."

Apply the polish by rubbing it in a circular motion with a rag, and then removing it with another rag. Buff the surface with a clean rag to shine up your piece. Do not put aluminum polish on any surface that will come in contact with food or fire. It is flammable and toxic."

Muriatic acid isn\u2019t pure hydrochloric acid and doesn\u2019t have a standard concentration. Make sure to always check the product label to know the exact concentration.

As long as you pour the acid into a container of water, the heat will be safely dispersed. Consult the label or manufacturer for dilution ratios of water to acid. If you pour the water into the acid, the initial mixture is very concentrated acid, and it may get hot enough to flash boil, sending concentrated acid spewing out of the container. Pouring acid into water prevents this and protects you from flash boiling."

You should also be sure that the aluminum piece is at room temperature before attempting to clean it with acid. You can also boil a dilute acid solution (e.g. 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar in 1 US quart (950 ml) of water) in a corroded pot or pan and then rinse and wipe it clean."
