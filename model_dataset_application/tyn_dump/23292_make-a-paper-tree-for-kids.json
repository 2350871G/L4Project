    "Use a paintbrush to apply a thin coat of glue to a small area on your cone.",
    "Press the eraser end of the pencil against the glue, then pull it away.",
    "The tissue paper square should be stuck to the cone.",
    "You can try using a glue stick, but you will need to support the cone from the inside with your hand so that it doesn't crumple.",
    "Use the pencil to glue more tissue paper squares to the cone.",
    "Work 1 tissue paper square at a time.",
    "Place the squares close enough so that they touch.",
    "Work from 1 side of the cone to the other.",
    "It does not matter if you start from the top or bottom of the cone.",

    "Make sure that the fringe is curling outward, not inward.",
    "Glue the rest of the fringes to the tree, working your way to the top.",
    "Use the 3 in (7.6 cm) wide strips first, then the 2 in (5.1 cm) ones.",

    "Let your tree dry, then decorate it as desired.",
    "Glue pompoms or buttons to the tree for a rustic look.",
    "You can also cut shapes out of craft foam or felt, and use those instead.",

    "Making a Palm Tree Paint an empty toilet paper roll with brown paint and let it dry.",
    "Find an empty toilet paper roll.",
    "Paint it with brown acrylic craft paint, tempera paint, or poster paint, then let it dry.",

    "Cut 5 3 in (7.6 cm) long leaves out of green construction paper.",
    "Fold a sheet of green construction paper in half.",
    "Draw 3 in (7.6 cm) long half-leaf shapes along the fold, then cut them out.",
    "Repeat this step using more paper as needed until your have 5 leaves.",
    "Cut a fringe into the edges of the leaves.",
    "Keeping the leaves folded, cut a fringe into the curved edges of the leaves.",
    "Leave a \u20444 to \u20444 in (0.64 to 0.64 cm) gap between the fringe and the folded edge of each leaf.",
    "Tape or glue green pipe cleaners to the leaves.",
    "Cut 2 green pipe cleaners into thirds to make them shorter.",
    "Open up your leaves, and tape a pipe cleaner down the middle of each leaf.",
    "Make sure that you have 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of pipe cleaner sticking out of the end of each leaf.",
    "Hot glue or tacky glue will work the best, but be sure to let it dry.",
    "You'll have 1 mini pipe cleaner leftover.",
    "Save it for another craft.",
    "Glue the pipe cleaners to the inside of your toilet paper roll.",
    "Coat the pipe cleaners with hot glue or tacky glue, then tuck them inside the toilet paper roll.",
    "Press them against the inside walls of the roll, then let the glue dry.",
    "You can also use pieces of masking tape instead.",
    "Tuck the pipe cleaners far enough into the toilet paper roll so that the ends of the leaves touch the top of the toilet paper roll.",
    "Bend the leaves downward once the glue dries.",
    "This will make the palm trees look for realistic.",
    "If you want to, you can bend the leaves so that they are curved rather than straight.",
    "For an even more realistic touch, hot glue some brown pompoms to the top of the tree to make coconuts."
