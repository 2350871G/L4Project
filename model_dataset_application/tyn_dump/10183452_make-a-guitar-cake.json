  "text":" Cutting the Cake Cut a guitar shape out of poster paper in the size you want your cake. Guitars come in all sorts of shapes, so look up pictures online. Once you've decided on the shape of your guitar, sketch it out on a sheet of poster paper. Cut the guitar out once you\u2019re done. This will be your template, so make sure that it\u2019s the same size you want your cake to be. Don\u2019t worry about the details on the guitar, such as the sound hole, tuning pegs, and strings. Focus just on the outline. Bake a sheet cake large enough to fit the body of the guitar. Measure the height and width of the guitar body, sans neck and head, then find a baking pan that matches that size. Find a cake recipe that you like, then bake it using that pan. After you cut the guitar body out, you'll use the scraps to make the neck and head of the guitar. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have enough, bake a second sheet cake. Use whatever recipe you want: chocolate, white, marble, etc. You could even use a boxed mix! The larger the baking pan is, the flatter the cake will be. If you want a taller cake, bake 2 sheet cakes. This way, you can stack them instead of cutting them in half. Set the cake on a cake board, then place the template on top. Let the cake cool for about 10 to 15 minutes first, then slide it out of the pan. Set it on top of a cake board, then place the guitar body template on top. A cake board is a large, thick sheet of cardboard typically covered in silver foil. You can find it in the baking section of a craft store. Don't worry about the neck and head of the guitar just yet. Place the template so that you'll have enough scraps to use for the neck and head. Cut around the template, then remove the scraps. Hold the template down with 1 hand while you use the other to cut around it. Remove the scraps so that you have just the body of the guitar left. Peel the template off as well. If you made 2 sheet cakes for a taller cake, do this step twice, once for each cake layer. Cut the rest of the cake to create the neck and head. Depending on how much scrap cake you have leftover, you may need to cut the neck and head in several parts, which is fine. Just work with what you have and try your best. Eat the rest of the scraps or save them to make cake pops! Repeat this step if you made 2 sheet cakes for a taller guitar cake. Filling and Frosting the Cake Slice the cake in half using a long knife, a cake slicer, or thread. Place your hand on top of the cake to hold it steady. Use your other hand to hold a knife parallel to the table and slice the cake in half. Carefully lift the top half of the cake and set it aside. You're slicing the cake in half to create 2 thin cakes. Don't chop it in half lengthwise or widthwise. Skip this step if you baked 2 sheet cakes to make a tall guitar cake. You'll be stacking them together instead. Assemble the pieces to create your guitar shape. Move the guitar body towards 1 end of the cake board. Place the neck just above the guitar body, then add the head. Make sure that all of the pieces are touching. Coat the bottom layer of the cake with cake filling. Use whatever type of frosting or filling you want for this: ganache, buttercream, jam, etc. You can even add some sliced strawberries on top of frosting! Be sure to apply a nice, thick layer of frosting, from edge-to-edge. If you baked 2 sheet cakes, coat the top of your first cake with frosting.

If the paper towel sticks to the cake, dust the paper towel with powdered sugar first. Decorating the Cake Draw designs onto the frosting with toothpicks or cookie cutters. Think of this as creating a coloring book page. Use a large, round cookie cutter or glass to create the outline for the sound hole. Next, use a toothpick to sketch out details, like the fret and bridge. Don't worry about sketching out the strings. Draw the horizontal lines (fret) on the neck, however.
