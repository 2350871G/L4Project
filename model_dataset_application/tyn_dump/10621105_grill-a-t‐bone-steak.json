          "description":"A T-bone steak is actually 2 steaks combined. T-bone steaks are measured from the edge of the tenderloin, which is the smaller steak, to the bone. The other steak is a NY strip steak, which is larger and not as lean. Tenderloins cook faster than strip steaks, so get larger tenderloins to cook your steak evenly. Although 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) is the most common size for grilled T-bone steaks, choose a 1 in (2.5 cm)-thick steak if you desire less meat. Anything smaller than this is prone to overcooking on the grill. Larger steaks, such as those over 2 in (5.1 cm) in thickness, are also good on the grill but take longer to cook."

The fat also gives the steak plenty of flavor. In the U.S., for instance, steaks are rated for quality. Prime steaks are the best cuts with the most marbling. Choice steaks are what most people grill. Select steaks are the lowest quality, so avoid them for grilling purposes. Also, pay attention to the fat around the outer edges of the steak. An \u20444 in (0.64 cm) layer of fat is ideal. If you see large chunks of white fat on the outer edge of the meat, you're going to pay for a part you can't eat."

Then, blot any remaining moisture off of the meat with a few paper towels. Excess fat melts in heat and drips into the grill, sometimes causing a flare-up. To avoid this, plan on cooking the steak away from direct heat with a drip pan under it. Then, finish the steak quickly over direct heat. Any moisture on the steak turns to steam, which cooks the meat and affects the sear."

          "description":"Cover both sides of the steak in a thick layer of about 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) of kosher salt. Adding the salt so far in advance draws the flavor out of the steak. The salt draws out the juices, which the steak reabsorbs before you cook it. If you don't have time to wait, season the steak right before cooking it. That way, the steak's fibers won't have enough time to release juices. Unless you put the steak on the grill right away or wait the full 40 minutes, your steak will lose those juices as it cooks."

        {
          "headline":"Add other seasonings to the steak as desired.",
          "description":"Let the steak's natural flavor shine through by including only salt and pepper. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon (2.30 g) of black pepper over the sides and edges of the steak. Add more pepper as desired to suit your tastes. Another option is to wait and add the pepper after cooking the steak. The pepper tends to burn a little, leaving a bitter flavor. Some people don't like this, but others think it balances out the flavor. Use other herbs and spices in a rub to give the T-bone additional flavor. For instance, mix together 2 teaspoons (4.2 g) of paprika, \u00be teaspoon (1.35 g) of cayenne pepper, \u00be teaspoon (1.80 g) of onion powder, \u00be teaspoon (0.24 g) of garlic powder, \u00be teaspoon (2.25 g) of turmeric, and \u00be teaspoon (1.35 g) of coriander. Another option is to let the steak rest in a marinade for at least 2 hours. Make a basic marinade out of \u20444 cup (180 mL) of soy sauce, \u20442 cup (120 mL) of lemon juice, \u20444 cup (59 mL) of Worcestershire sauce, \u00bc cup (62.25 g) of mustard, and 4 cloves of garlic to give the steak plenty of flavor."

        {
          "headline":"Rest the steak at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.",
          "description":"Leave the seasoned steak out on a plate as you begin heating up the grill. This gives the meat some time to dry out as the salt does its job. If you plan on seasoning the steak well in advance, store it in the refrigerator to prevent bacterial growth. A steak can be left out at room temperature for up to 2 hours before bacteria makes it inedible. Keep the steak in the refrigerator if you don't plan on cooking it within that timespan."
