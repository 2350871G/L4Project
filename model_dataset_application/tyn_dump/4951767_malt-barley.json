Malting barley requires a large bucket, a strainer, baking sheets, and a dehydrator. A good quantity of barley to start with is between 1 and 4 pounds (450 and 1,810 g). Don\u2019t fill the bucket more than halfway; otherwise, there won\u2019t be room for water and expansion as the grains absorb water.

Drying the barley at a low temperature will stop the germination process and remove excess moisture from the grains. Dry the barley for up to 24 hours in a dehydrator.
