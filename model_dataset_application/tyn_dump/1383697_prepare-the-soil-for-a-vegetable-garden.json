Find a place in your yard that has enough space for the vegetables you want to grow and receives direct sunlight throughout the day. When you find a spot in your yard that you like, drive garden stakes into the corners so you don\u2019t forget where your spot is. You can make your vegetable garden any size you want, but aim to have at least 40\u201350 square feet (3.7\u20134.6 m) so you have room to plant multiple vegetables."
