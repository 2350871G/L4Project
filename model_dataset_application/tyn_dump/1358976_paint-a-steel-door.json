Make sure the primer you are using is compatible with your chosen paint. Each product should say which others they are compatible with, but you can ask for help when purchasing them if you\u2019re unsure. Different primers will take different amounts of time to dry in different climates. It can take between 1 and 3 hours for each coat to fully dry. Give the door a light touch every hour until you are certain the door is dry. If painting both sides of the door, you'll need to work one side at a time. Apply both coats of primer to the door and let fully dry before turning over to prime the other side. If you use a Direct-To-Metal paint, you can begin applying it without applying primer to the door first. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions when painting with a specific product."

Be careful to fix any drips or uneven roller strokes before the paint dries. It might be easier to paint in the morning, early evening or in the shade, so the paint doesn\u2019t dry too quickly and stays wet while you\u2019re still painting. Give the door plenty of time to dry between coats, normally between 6 to 12 hours but sometimes up to 18. Check the information on your chosen paint for more information on the expected drying times.
