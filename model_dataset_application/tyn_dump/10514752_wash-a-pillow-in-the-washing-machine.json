The label should say if it can be machine washed and or if it needs to be dry cleaned or hand washed instead. If your pillow is synthetic and old, check to ensure it won't fall apart in the machine. Fold the pillow in half. If it doesn't unfold right away, discard the pillow."

Since memory foam and latex pillows will lose their shape if tossed in the machine, steam or dry clean these pillows. You should also avoid machine washing pillows filled with buckwheat. To wash these, you'll have to empty the buckwheat filling and set the buckwheat in the sun for a few hours while you wash the pillow casing."

Try to put two pillows into your front-loading washing machine so the machine drum stays balanced as it runs. A balanced machine will also make the water and laundry detergent move through the drum better."

This is because top-loading machines are rougher as they agitate the pillows. It's important to balance the load in the top-loading machine so it spins effectively. If you put a pillow around one half of the drum, put another pillow on the opposite side or fill that side with the same amount of laundry."
