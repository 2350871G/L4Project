Hauling your clothes all over the place is a pain, so go to the laundromat closest to you unless you have unique requirements or a vehicle that you can drive to the laundromat. If you\u2019re carrying a lot of laundry, don\u2019t risk your back by walking to the laundromat if it\u2019s farther than 1 block away. Laundromats tend to be busier on the weekend. If you want the best chance of getting an open machine, do your laundry during the week. Some laundromats are open 24 hours a day. Look for a laundromat that is always open if you want to do your laundry late at night or early in the morning."

          "description":"Some people will wash whites on one night and return to the laundromat the next day to wash their colors. Many people simply use 2 machines to wash their colors and whites at the same time. Either way, sort your laundry into 2 separate piles based on the color. Put your whites at the bottom of the laundry basket and place your colors on top. Alternatively, you can get 2 laundry bags to keep your clothes sorted as you travel. This way, you won\u2019t need to waste time separating your clothes at the laundromat. You can put a sheet of cardboard or some other kind of divider in between your colors and whites if you want to make retrieving each set of clothes from a single basket easier. If you\u2019re walking to the laundromat, a cloth laundry bag will be easier to carry than a hard-plastic or metal bin. If you\u2019re really dedicated to washing materials properly, read each tag on your items of clothing for washing instructions and sort lighter colors from your darks. Wash your jeans separately, and keep delicate fabrics together for a separate load."

    "Some machines have separate cycles for whites and colors.",
    "Use these settings if they\u2019re available and you\u2019ve sorted your laundry by color.",
    "Wait for the cycle to finish.",
    "Bring a book, handheld game, or newspaper if you want to distract yourself while the clothes are drying.",
    "Alternatively, use your time to get some work done, answer emails, or finish homework.",
    "Stay in the laundromat if you want to assure that nobody messes with your clothes and your cycle runs through to completion.",
    "Variation: If there\u2019s a clerk at the laundromat and you\u2019re not worried about anyone messing with your clothes, feel free to leave while the cycle is running.. People in major cities often leave their clothes unattended when they\u2019re washing or drying, although there is always a risk involved.",
    "If you do leave, return before the cycle finishes though to avoid having someone take your clothes out to use the machine while it isn\u2019t running.",
    "Drying Your Clothes at the Laundromat Find an unoccupied dryer nearby and inspect it.",
    "Often, there\u2019s a dryer attached to each laundry machine at the laundromat.",
    "If there isn\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to move your clothes, though.",
    "Either way, once you find an unoccupied dryer, open it to inspect the drum and look for forgotten items of clothing.",
    "Take a sniff to see if the drum smells moldy or wet.",
    "If it does, the machine is likely not working properly.",
    "Find a different dryer if this is the case.",
    "Like the washing machines, you can use multiple drying machines at the same time if you\u2019re drying multiple loads.",
    "Load your clothes into the dryer.",
    "Dry each individual load of clothing in separate dryers.",
    "Remove your wet clothes and transfer them to your dryer.",
    "When you finish loading the clothes, put your coins into the corresponding slot to turn the machine on.",
    "Insert coins and select your dryer setting before starting the cycle.",
    "Use the standard cycle for a standard wash load.",
    "Use the \u201cDelicate\u201d or \u201cLow Heat\u201d setting for sensitive fabrics.",
    "If there\u2019s a timed cycle, use 45-60 minutes based on the size of your load.",
    "Pull the dial out or press the \u201cStart\u201d button to initiate your cycle.",
    "Some machines allow you to adjust the amount of heat that you use to dry your clothes.",
    "The more heat that you use, the more likely your clothes are to shrink\u2014especially if they\u2019re made out of cotton.",
    "If you aren\u2019t sure if you can machine dry a particular item of clothing, read the tag.",
    "There are washing and drying instructions on most clothing tags.",
    "Feel free to add dryer sheets or dryer balls to your dryer if you want to keep your clothes wrinkle and static free.",
    "Wait for the drying cycle to finish.",
    "Once your drying cycle starts, you\u2019ll have another 30-60 minutes to kill.",
    "Continue reading your book, answering emails, or catching up on homework.",
    "Stay nearby to ensure that nobody interrupts your cycle.If you felt comfortable leaving during the wash cycle, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t leave again.",
    "Feel free to go grab a cup of coffee or hang out at a nearby store.",
    "Remove your clothes and fold them if you\u2019d like.",
    "When the dryer finishes running, open the door and remove your clothes.",
    "You can fold them if you\u2019d like, but there\u2019s no rule that you have to do it at the laundromat.",
    "It\u2019s totally up to you whether you want to fold your clothes before putting them back in your laundry basket and going home.",
    "Tip: Folding your clothes as soon as they come out of the dryer reduces the odds that static cling and wrinkles develop on your clothes.",
    "Fold them at the laundromat if wrinkle- and static-free clothing is important to you."
