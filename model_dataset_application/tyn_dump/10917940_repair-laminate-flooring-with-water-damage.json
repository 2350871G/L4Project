Turn off your water supply to prevent leaking from continuing. If the leak comes from an appliance, like your refrigerator, you will have to get it fixed before you can start repairing your flooring. The leak could be the result of a broken pipe or something else inside your home\u2019s walls. If this is the case, call a professional to come inspect the issue before you begin working on the flooring. Whenever there is a small spill of any kind on your laminate flooring, wipe it up immediately to prevent water damage from occurring over time."

There are a number of signs that point to your floor being water damaged, including bending or cracking. Tiles can also be pushed apart by water damage. Go over every tile individually when you check. As you walk around, push on your floorboards to see if they are popping up out of the base of the floor. Be critical when you do this, as even a small distortion to the tiles can be the result of water damage. If any part of a tile is damaged, the whole tile will need to be replaced."
