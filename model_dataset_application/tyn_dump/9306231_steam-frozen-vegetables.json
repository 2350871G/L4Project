          "description":"If the recipe you\u2019re making calls for a specific amount of water, you may want to thaw your veggies before steaming. The water locked inside frozen vegetables can add a considerable amount after it thaws. Defrosting veggies in your refrigerator will decrease the risk of bacteria contaminating your food. Use a bowl to catch the water during the thawing process. The time it takes food to thaw in your refrigerator will vary. Generally, you can expect 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of food to thaw in about 24 hours."

          "description":"You only need about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water in the bottom of the pot to steam your veggies. Bring the water to a boil on your stove, then place your steaming basket or colander in the pot so it hangs above the water. Your steaming basket or colander shouldn\u2019t hang low enough to touch the water when boiling. About 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space should be sufficient."

          "description":"Put the frozen veggies into a steaming basket or colander, nest the basket or colander in the pot, then put on the lid. Lids with a small vent are preferred, as these will allow a small amount of steam to escape, preventing condensation around the lid's edges. Water that drips from the edges of ventless lids can dirty your stovetop. Clean any spillage from your stovetop right away after steaming to prevent it from turning into a hard film."

          "description":"The time it takes to steam your vegetables will vary. Veggies like zucchini or sweet peppers will likely only need 2 to 4 minutes, but root vegetables (like potatoes) may need 12 minutes or more. If you\u2019re unsure whether your veggies are fully cooked, stick them with a fork. If you encounter resistance or hardness, especially at the center, you need to keep steaming."

        {
          "headline":"Season the steamed veggies and enjoy.",
          "description":"Once steamed, you can season the veggies as you see fit. Most veggies pair well with salt, pepper, and a little butter. You can get a sweet and spicy taste with a light dusting of chili flakes, some drizzled honey, and a little lemon juice. Seasonings should be adjusted according to taste. To prevent over-seasoning, add seasoning to the veggies little by little and check the flavor after each addition."
