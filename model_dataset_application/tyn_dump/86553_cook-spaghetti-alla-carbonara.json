  "text":" Spaghetti alla Carbonara Start a pot of boiling water and cook the pasta.  Combine the eggs, cheese, salt and pepper in a small bowl and beat with a fork. Add only enough cheese to make it somewhat thick. If it looks like cake batter, you have added too much cheese. Add some olive oil to a small saucepan and cook the pancetta thoroughly. Keep warm until pasta is done. Add the pasta and pancetta to the bowl and begin stirring gently. The grease from the bacon and the heat from the pasta will cook the eggs enough to prevent disease. Finished.  Spaghetti Carbonara Slice bacon into 1/2\" pieces and put in fry pan (don't turn on stove heat yet).  Bring water to boil in the heavy pot for the pasta.  Once the water is boiling, put the pasta in and set a timer for 10 minutes.  Turn on heat under the fry pan to medium-high to begin cooking the bacon.  Cook the bacon - adjusting the heat as necessary to render fat out of the bacon, but avoid cooking the bacon to the crispy stage - you really want it soft and just slightly browned.  Timing is critical  - you should be able to have the bacon cooked in the 10 minutes it takes to cook the pasta - you may need to lower the heat to keep the bacon hot.  Quickly dump the pasta in the strainer and shake quickly to remove excess water - do not rinse - return to the hot pot you used to boil the pasta.  Pour the contents of the fry pan (bacon and fat) over the pasta in the pot and begin to stir  - coating the pasta with the bacon fat.
