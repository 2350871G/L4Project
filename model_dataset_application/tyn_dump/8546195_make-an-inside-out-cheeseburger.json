Add 2 tablespoons (34 g) of Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons (2 g) of paprika, and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste to the meat. Use clean hands to gently mix the beef with the seasonings until they are thoroughly combined. Be careful not to overwork the ground beef when you\u2019re mixing it. That can result in tough burgers. You can add whatever your favorite burger seasonings are to the ground beef. For example, garlic powder, onion powder, and crushed red pepper are tasty options."

They should be approximately 3-inches (7.5-cm) in diameter. Set the burgers aside for a moment. If you\u2019re have trouble forming the ground beef into round patties, you may want to use mold to help you get the shape right. The lid from a peanut butter jar or other small jar can work well."
