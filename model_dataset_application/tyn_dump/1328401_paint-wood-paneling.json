          "description":"To ensure you have plenty of room to paint, you want to clear as much space away from the walls as possible. In addition, leaving furniture near the walls leaves it susceptible to being stained by paint. If you can't move the furniture out of the room, move it to the center of the room and cover it with a drop cloth instead. Canvas drop cloths work best, but they are a little more expensive. If you don\u2019t have one, lay down a tarp or another waterproof material. That way, if paint drips, it won\u2019t soak through and stain your floor. It\u2019s also a good idea to remove any light switch plates, curtain rods, or other decorative items that are attached to the walls."

          "description":"As you're wiping the walls down, focus especially on the crevices in the panels, since dirt tends to build up here. Dust, dirt, and other debris will create an uneven surface that will show beneath your paint. Let the wall dry completely before you move to the next step. A damp microfiber cloth is a good option, since it will trap a lot of dust, but you can use any cleaning cloth you have on hand. Professionals often use a solution made from trisodium phosphate (TSP) and water to wash walls before painting, but this is an extremely toxic chemical. If you choose to use it, wear long sleeves, pants, rubber gloves, protective glasses, and a respiratory mask, and open the windows in the room the ventilate it, then let the walls dry for about a day."

          "description":"If there are any nail holes, chips, or other imperfections, use a putty knife to fill them with a generous amount of joint compound or spackle. After you apply it, scrape away excess compound with the putty knife, but don\u2019t worry about getting it all off the wall, since you\u2019ll address that later. The compound shrinks when it dries, so it's better to apply it in a thick layer and sand it down later, rather than not to apply enough. If you like, you can use a trowel instead of a putty knife, depending on what you have on hand. If there aren\u2019t any chips or holes in the walls, you can skip this."

Use the same method you did to fill in any holes in the wall. This will make it easier to create a smooth surface for the painting. Some people prefer to leave the grooves exposed when painting over wood paneling, giving the painted walls a little additional texture and visual appeal. In that case, there\u2019s no need to fill in the grooves with the compound."

The goal is to create a smooth, even surface, so the compound won't show under your finished paint job. It's a good idea to wear a face mask with a respirator when you're sanding so you don't breathe in any fine particles."

Gently scuff the surface of the paneling to remove the shine, working in even, circular motions. However, don't sand all the way back down to the bare wood, since these spots might show through your paint. Sanding will help to remove any protective coating on the paneling that could interfere with the adherence of the paint. If you\u2019ll be painting the trim, sand it as well."

Depending on the final effect you want to achieve, you can choose from a variety of different finishes, from flat, which has the least amount of shine, to gloss, which is a high-shine paint. An eggshell finish, also called a satin finish, has a little luster but isn't super-shiny, making it a great choice for most interior rooms. If the paneling you're painting is very dark, it may be a good idea to get a paint that contains primer, as this will give you more opaque coverage.

Then, place the angled tip of the brush against the line you want to paint, and carefully spread the paint in an even layer. If the grooves in the paneling are very deep, you might need to paint them with your brush. Do this before you roll the wall, since the roller will smooth out any brush marks you might have left.

Place the roller in the pan and roll it over the grooves to load it with paint. When you lift the roller, it should be covered in paint, but it should not drip excessively. If it does, use the side of the pan to wipe away some of the excess paint. Using more than 1 in (2.5 cm) could cause the paint to overflow when you dip in the roller. Once you start painting, you can add more paint to the pan as needed. If you'll be painting several rooms, it might be more convenient to pour the paint into a large bucket with a roller screen inside the bucket. Dip the roller into the paint, then roll it over the screen to remove any excess. A roller with a medium nap should be long enough to get paint into the paneling grooves while still leaving a smooth finish."

Just be sure to let the paint dry completely before adding another coat, and sand the paint lightly between coats to ensure it adheres completely. The drying time will vary depending on the brand of paint you use, but many paints need 6-8 hours to dry. Wipe down the paint with a dry cloth every time you sand it."

    "Depending on the final effect you want to achieve, you can choose from a variety of different finishes, from flat, which has the least amount of shine, to gloss, which is a high-shine paint.",
    "An eggshell finish, also called a satin finish, has a little luster but isn't super-shiny, making it a great choice for most interior rooms.",
    "If the paneling you're painting is very dark, it may be a good idea to get a paint that contains primer, as this will give you more opaque coverage.",
    "However, this isn't necessary, and an extra coat of paint will usually serve just as well.",
    "To determine how much paint you'll need, look online for a coverage calculator from your preferred manufacturer, or you can ask an associate at your local paint store to help you.",
    "Cut in around the room with a paintbrush.",
    "Using an angled 2.5 in (6.4 cm) paintbrush, paint around the edges of the wall, including along the ceiling line, around any doors and windows, and inside any small crevices that a roller might not reach.",
    "Load up your brush with paint, only wiping off enough excess to ensure the brush doesn't drip.",
    "Then, place the angled tip of the brush against the line you want to paint, and carefully spread the paint in an even layer.",
    "If the grooves in the paneling are very deep, you might need to paint them with your brush.",
    "Do this before you roll the wall, since the roller will smooth out any brush marks you might have left.",
    "When the paintbrush starts to feel like it's dragging on the wall, add more paint.",
    "Pour about 1 in (2.5 cm) of paint into a pan and load the roller.",
    "For smaller jobs, like a single room, use a paint pan filled with about 1 in (2.5 cm) of your latex wall paint.",
    "Place the roller in the pan and roll it over the grooves to load it with paint.",
    "When you lift the roller, it should be covered in paint, but it should not drip excessively.",
    "If it does, use the side of the pan to wipe away some of the excess paint.",
    "Using more than 1 in (2.5 cm) could cause the paint to overflow when you dip in the roller.",
    "Once you start painting, you can add more paint to the pan as needed.",
    "If you'll be painting several rooms, it might be more convenient to pour the paint into a large bucket with a roller screen inside the bucket.",
    "Dip the roller into the paint, then roll it over the screen to remove any excess.",
    "A roller with a medium nap should be long enough to get paint into the paneling grooves while still leaving a smooth finish.",
    "Use the roller to apply an even coat of paint to the walls.",
    "Place the round part of the roller against the wall.",
    "Holding it with gentle but firm pressure, roll it over the wall in a continuous up-and-down zigzag motion.",
    "When you feel the roller start to stick to the wall, add more paint from the pan.",
    "Pressing too hard on the roller will cause it to leave streaks in the paint.",
    "Use a dry brush or a cloth to wipe away excess paint if you notice it pooling in the paneling grooves.",
    "Apply a second or third coat of paint, if necessary.",
    "Depending on the thickness of the paint and the opacity of the primer you used, you might only need 1 coat of paint, or you might need as many as 3.",
    "Just be sure to let the paint dry completely before adding another coat, and sand the paint lightly between coats to ensure it adheres completely.",
    "The drying time will vary depending on the brand of paint you use, but many paints need 6-8 hours to dry.",
    "Wipe down the paint with a dry cloth every time you sand it."
