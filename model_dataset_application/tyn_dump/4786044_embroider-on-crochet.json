To make a slipknot:\nForm a loop by crossing the loose end of the yarn under the attached end. Grab the attached side and pull it up through the loop, creating a second loop in the process. Tighten the first loop around the second. Insert the hook into the second loop and tighten the second loop onto the hook."

    "Bring the needle up from the back.",
    "Poke the needle into the back of the material at the point where you want the French knot.",
    "Pull the needle and the yarn completely through to the front.",
    "Ideally, you should position the needle in between to stitches/strands in your original crochet piece.",
    "Continue pulling the yarn through until the overhand knot at the end of your strand lies flat against the back of the work Pinch the yarn and straighten the needle.",
    "With the index finger and thumb of your non-dominant hand, pinch the yarn 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10 cm) above the surface of the material.",
    "Lay the side of the needle against the yarn, positioning it in between your pinched fingers and the surface of the material.",
    "Wrap the yarn around the needle.",
    "Using your non-dominant hand, wrap the yarn around the needle two to four times.",
    "Continue pinching the yarn as you do this.",
    "You'll need to maintain a good amount of tension to prevent the yarn from unwinding.",
    "The number of times you wind the knot will alter the thickness of the French knot.",
    "The more you wind the yarn, the larger the French knot will be.",
    "Insert the tip of the needle back into the fabric.",
    "Choose a point directly next to the exit point, but do not use the same exact spot.",
    "An adjacent stitch gap should be fine.",
    "Do not push the needle all the way through the material yet.",
    "Do not use the same exact hole.",
    "If you do, the knot will likely pop out through the back of the fabric when you finish.",
    "Tighten the coil.",
    "Use your non-dominant hand to gently tug the yarn downward, causing the coils to tighten.",
    "Continue tugging until the coils wind themselves into a tight bunch, snug against the top of the crochet material.",
    "Push your needle all the way through.",
    "Finish pushing the yarn needle through the fabric.",
    "The needle and the tail hanging off it should run through the center of the bundled coils, tightening them into a decorative knot.",
    "Knot the yarn from the back.",
    "Tie another large overhand knot at the back of the material to secure the French knot from the other side.",
    "Trim the rest of the tail, if desired, or weave the tail through the back side of the crochet work to hide it."
