  "text":" Making a Basic Paper Fan Place a sheet of 8-inch-by-11-inch (21.6 cm by 27.9 cm) paper, wallpaper or cardstock face down on your work surface. You can use larger paper, but this size is easy to find and work with. Set the paper in portrait orientation, meaning it's taller than it is wider. Practice with plain or scrap paper when you start learning. You can then switch to more decorative papers once you're comfortable with the technique. Lightly draw fold lines across your paper. Using a pencil and ruler, draw vertical lines 3/4 inch to 1 inch (1.9 cm to 2.54 cm) apart. These should go straight from the bottom to top of the paper. For larger wall fans, move the lines apart in proportion to the paper size. Smaller fans could have smaller folds, which will make the fan seem more detailed. Accordion fold the paper. Fold on the first line, bringing the right side of the paper toward you. Use a bone folder to press the crease firmly. You should now see a peak. Fold on the next line. You should it in the opposite direction of the first fold, creasing the fold with the bone folder. You should now see a dip in the paper, or a valley. Continue to fold your paper back and forth. You'll start seeing these dips and peaks. They should alternate between these mountains and valleys. Gather the bottom of the paper. You should be grasping the gathered portion between your fingers, while the vertical pleats of the paper extend up and out. The paper fans out. Bind the bottom of the folded strip with strong tape. Alternately, you could glue each fold to the next. Place the glue along the bottom of the fan where you've gathered it. If you are using glue, let it dry completely before opening the fan. Open the folds at the top of your fan. You can now use the fan or embellish it. Making a Paddle Fan Cut a piece of heavy cardstock paper into your preferred shape. You can leave it square, cut it into a circle, round the bottom and make the top taper for a spade shape, or cut it into a heart. Place the paper face down on a table. The side of the fan that will be hidden should be facing up at you. Spread glue onto the top half of an oversized wooden craft stick. Make sure to keep glue off the part of the stick that will extend out from the piece of cardstock. Attach the glue stick to the back of the cardstock on your table. Ensure that a good portion of the stick is extended out from the paper, so you will have a handle to hold. Cut another piece of cardstock to match and glue it to the back of your fan, optional. This will hide the stick and create a sturdy double-sided fan. Be sure to spread glue onto the back of the handle, as well as around all edges of the fan. Let the glue dry completely. Once it's dry, you can use your fan or embellish it. Making a Craft Stick Photo Fan Get your supplies ready. You'll need a power drill, a dozen craft sticks, paint and brush (optional), a photograph (optional), a craft knife, glue, water, and embroidery floss. Drill a small hole about 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom your craft sticks. Do this for the rest of your craft sticks. Make sure all the holes are drilled at the same spot on all the sticks. Use caution when cutting with a power drill. Wear eye protection and do the cutting on a flat surface. Drill another hole about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the other end on each craft stick. This will be the top of your fan and will spread out more than the base. Paint the sticks with acrylic or tempera paint (optional). Allow them to dry thoroughly. You may find that some colors, particularly reds, will need 2 or even 3 coats. Lay your craft sticks side by side and measure the length and width. Make sure the sticks are touching, without any gaps in between them. Prepare your image. Enlarge a photograph or cut a magazine photo to the size of the sticks you measured. Make sure your image is the exact same size of the sticks when touching. Set the photo over the sticks. The image should completely fit over the sticks. If sticks are still visible at the sides, you should enlarge or cut a bigger image. If your photo hangs over the side of the sticks, you need to trim the image down. Gently trace lines along the photo. Use a craft knife to score the picture lightly along the sides of each stick. Flip the photo over and number the spaces. This will help keep them in order after cutting. Make sure you're numbering the back of the photo and not the picture itself. Cut the photo into strips. Use a craft knife to ensure a neat, straight cut. Hold a ruler tightly against the cutting line and slide the knife along the edge of the ruler, pressing hard enough to cut through the picture. Be extremely careful when using the craft knife. Prepare your adhesive. In a small container, mix equal parts of craft glue and water. Apply the photo strips to the craft sticks. You'll need to brush the glue mix on the back of one picture strip. Center the strip on a stick, and brush a thin coat of the mixture on all sides of the stick and picture. Repeat this for the remaining strips and sticks. Let them dry completely. Stack the sticks in order with the holes aligned. You can check to make sure your image is correct, by spreading the sticks back out to see if they're in order. Thread the bottom of your fan. Tie a knot in embroidery floss or 1/8-inch (.32 cm) ribbon. Thread the other end through the holes that are 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom of the sticks. Tie a knot to secure the bottom of the fan. Thread the top of your fan. Spread the tops of the sticks so they lie next to one another and tie a knot in the floss while the fan is open. Secure your knots. Add a dot of glue to the knots and let them dry completely before opening and closing your fan. Embellishing Your Fan Paint your fan. You can use a tempera or acrylic paint to decorate your craft sticks or paper. Note that if painting the paper, it's easier to paint before folding your fan. Let your paper or sticks dry completely before using. Attach decorations. Using glue or double-sided tape, attach bits of ribbon, lace, buttons, feathers, stickers or beads. Make sure not to add items that are heavy, since they could tear your fan. Shape your fan. You can easily make your fan take on a whole new shape by making a few simple cuts.
