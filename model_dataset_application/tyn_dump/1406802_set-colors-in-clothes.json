While you can run your clothes through the dryer if you prefer (or if you need them done quickly), heat causes the fabrics to break down faster, causing your clothes to fade. After the vinegar has helped set the color, air drying helps keep colors bright and fabrics strong. While the vinegar smell should evaporate during the rinse cycle, if there is any residual smell, air drying should get rid of it. In addition to setting the colors, vinegar cleans and sanitizes your clothes, so you won't need to run them through again with your regular detergent until they are in need of another wash."
