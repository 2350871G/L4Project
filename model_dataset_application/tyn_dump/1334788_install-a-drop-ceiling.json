Use a 4 ft (1.2 m) level and draw a straight line with your pencil completely around your room. Snap a chalk line if you don\u2019t want to draw the lines on yourself. Hold the string of the chalk line against your wall and snap it so the line transfers onto the drywall. If you plan on installing a large fluorescent light panel, make your line 6 in (15 cm) down."

Since wall angles are usually sold in 8\u201312 ft (2.4\u20133.7 m) lengths, trim them down with your tin snips to match the lengths of your walls. If you have a corner that juts out from your wall, cut the wall angles going on those walls \u20442 in (1.3 cm) longer than your measurements.

Use 1 \u20444 in (3.2 cm) screws and electric screwdriver where you marked the studs to secure your wall angles in place. Double check that your wall angles are level as you install them.Tip: If a wall angle bows out, don\u2019t try to tighten it flat against the wall since it may warp the metal.

Instead, keep the wall angle straight by placing a wooden shim between it and the wall. When your ceiling is completely finished, fill the gap in with caulk. Putting in the Grid System Cut the main runners to fit the length of your room perpendicular to the joists. The main runners will support the bulk of the weight of your ceiling. Measure the length of your room that runs perpendicular to the wooden joists of your ceiling. Cut the runners with a pair of tin snips to the correct length. If your room is longer than the length of a main runner, use the clips on the ends of the piece to attach them together. Use a chalk line or tie strings across your room every 4 ft (1.2 m). Secure the end of a chalk line on one end of your room and pull it tight to the other side. Snap the chalk line to leave a line on the joists. Move over 4 ft (1.2 m) and make another line on your ceiling. Keep moving across your room until you reach the other edge. You may also tie strings tight across your ceiling if you don\u2019t have a chalk line. Screw an eyelet into every third joist along your line. Eyelet screws have holes on the end so you can run wires through them to hang your main runner. Attach a lag bit onto your electric screwdriver, and set an eyelet inside the bit. Start placing your eyelets 3 joists away from the wall along each of your chalk or string lines. Keep adding an eyelet at every third joist. Eye lit screws can be purchased from your local hardware store. Feed a length of wire through each of the eyelets. Cut a 8\u201310 in (20\u201325 cm) piece of 16-gauge wire for each of your eyelets. Feed about 2 in (5.1 cm) of the wire through the eyelet, and bend it with a pair of pliers until it points down. Hang up the main runners by the wires. Hold one of your main runners up so the ends rest on your wall angles and so it\u2019s perpendicular to your joists. Feed the other end of the wire through one of the circular slots on the runner, and bend it up with your pliers. Twist the wires around themselves at least 3 times to keep them secure. Make sure your joists are level as you keep adding wires. Adjust where the bend is in the wires if one side is higher than the other. Install the secondary runners perpendicular to your mains by clipping them in place. Locate the slots on the main runners every 2 ft (0.61 m). Lift your 4 ft (1.2 m) runners above the main runners and feed them into the slots on the mains. Put a secondary runner every 2 ft (0.61 m) along your main runners.Tip: If you want a 2 ft \u00d7 2 ft (0.61 m \u00d7 0.61 m) tile system, click 2 ft (0.61 m) secondary runners in the center each 4 ft (1.2 m) runner. Installing the Ceiling Tiles Make holes in the tiles for any lighting or ductwork first. Locate any areas on your ceiling where you need to make an opening for your ducts or light fixtures. Trace the end of the duct or the size of the light feature onto the back of one of your tiles. Cut the shape out of the tile with a sharp utility knife. If you\u2019re installing a full-panel fluorescent light fixture, you don\u2019t need to cut any shapes from the tiles. Trim any edge tiles down to size with a utility knife. Your room will most likely have edges that won\u2019t fit full-sized tiles. Measure the grid opening for the tile and add \u20448 in (0.95 cm) to the measurement you found. Transfer that measurement to tile and cut the piece to size using a utility knife. Avoid using any power equipment to cut your tiles since it will generate a lot of dust.Tip: Tiles usually come in 2 ft \u00d7 4 ft (0.61 m \u00d7 1.22 m) or 2 ft \u00d7 2 ft (0.61 m \u00d7 0.61 m) sizes.

Cut out a \u20448 in (0.95 cm) flange in any cut edge of your tiles. The flanges rest on your runners and make the tile have more dimension when you put it in your ceiling. Measure in \u20448 in (0.95 cm) from any edge that doesn\u2019t have a flange and draw a line with a pencil. Follow along the line with a utility knife, only cutting halfway through the tile. Make another cut on the side of the tile at the same depth as your first cut to remove the flange piece. This only needs to be done if your tiles don\u2019t have flanges already. Lift the tiles through the grid and set them on top of the grid. Start in the center of your room and work towards the edges. Angle the tiles and lift them through the grid system. Straighten the tiles out before setting the flanges on the runners. Continue putting the tiles into your ceiling until it\u2019s completely covered. Make sure the tiles are level as you install them.
