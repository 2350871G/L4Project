  "text":" Draining the Water and Drying the Water Lines Allow all water to drain from the fresh water holding tank. To drain the water from your RV, you'll need to open what's called the \"petcock.\" Do not be tempted to drain the water heater yet -- that has to be done after you add antifreeze. Drain the black and gray holding tanks. You should also flush both tanks at this time.

If you don't, air can't come out the other end! Flush your toilets a few times to make sure all the water's gone! Attach a compressed air adapter to the RV\u2019s water lines.
