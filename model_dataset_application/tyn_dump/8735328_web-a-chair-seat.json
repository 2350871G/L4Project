If you have a choice of colors, choose the colors you prefer. One or two colors gives you simplest look and process. Jute webbing is another option, but this is typically used when a cushion will go over it and may not give you the look you want or be comfortable for sitting on. Measure the seat from back to front.

Use sharp scissors to cut the strips and lay them side to side on the seat. Space them as you will when you attach them. Again, using wider spacing means you need less strips. Take the strips off of the seat and set them aside in two groups. Once you have the strips cut so that you have enough for the whole seat, lay them aside. Divide them up in a pile for back to front and a pile for side to side. If you have strips of various length, try to keep them arranged in order. Attaching the First Layer of Webbing Lay the first strip in the middle of the chair from front to back. Starting from the middle will help you adjust the spacing as you lay strips outward on each side. This gives you more flexibility than if you start on one side or the other.

Be sure to keep it tight when you staple it. Attach the second strip to either the left or right of the first. Following the same procedure as you used with the first strip, attach the second strip. Space it as close as you want to the first strip. Be sure to staple the back first, stretch the strip, then staple the front. Alternate from left to right of the first strip to attach the remaining strips. To check your spacing each time, lay one strip to the left of the first and then one strip to the right. Then go back to the left and back to the right, stapling each in place as you go. When you get close to the edges, you\u2019ll be able to tell if you need to trim a strip down lengthwise.

If this is the case, lay the strip on the seat and make a mark for how wide it should be. Cut the strip down its length and attach it to the seat. Weaving in the Second Layer Lay the first sideways strip in the middle of the seat. Take one of the strips with the side to side measurement and attach it like you did the first round of strips. Tuck the end under and staple it to the outside edge of the seat. Only staple one end of the strip for now. Attach a strip to the left of the first strip and then attach one to the right.
