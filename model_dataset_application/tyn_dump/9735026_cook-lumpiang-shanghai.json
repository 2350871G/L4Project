  "text":" Preparing the Mixture Mix the pork, beef, onion and carrot. Place 1 pound (450 g) of ground beef and 1 pound (450 g) of ground pork into a large bowl. Add 1 finely-chopped medium onion and 1 grated carrot. Mix the ingredients together thoroughly. It would be best to use your hands, but you can use a wooden spoon or spatula too.

If you have a different filling that you'd like to use, feel free to do so. Stir in the soy sauce, salt, garlic, and pepper. Pour 1/4 cup (60 mL) of soy sauce into the bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, 1\u00bd tablespoons of garlic powder, and 2\u00bd teaspoons of ground black pepper. Keep stirring with your hands, wooden spoon, or rubber spatula until the seasonings are distributed evenly throughout the meat mixture. Cook a small amount of the filling in a skillet to test the flavor (optional). Scoop out about a tablespoon of the filling and flatten it into a patty. Drop it onto a nonstick-skillet and fry it on both sides until it is cooked through. Give the patty a taste, then make any necessary adjustments to the rest of the uncooked filling. Add enough oil into the skillet to prevent sticking. You don't need to deep-fry the patty; you just need to cook it long enough to make the meat edible. While not absolutely necessary, this will ensure that your lumpia taste the way you want them to. It will prevent you from wasting a bad-tasting batch. Prepare a homemade sweet and sour sauce, if desired. Whisk together all of the ingredients except for the cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Bring the mixture to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Dissolve 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in 5 teaspoons of water, then stir it into the sauce. Keep stirring until the sauce thickens, then remove it from heat. Pour the sauce into a bowl, then set is aside while you prepare the rest of the lumpia. You can re-heat it later over the stove, if desired. You don't have to make the sauce yourself. You can buy the sauce from the store. Wrapping the Lumpia Place 2 tablespoons of the mixture onto a spring roll wrapper. Take a spring roll wrapper and set it down on a flat surface. Rotate it so that it looks like a diamond. Place 2 tablespoons of the mixture onto the center of the wrapper. Orient the mixture horizontally, and make it no thicker than your finger. Make sure that the wrappers are fresh; check both the expiration and manufacturing date. The further they are from the manufacturing date, the less flexible they will become. Keep a clean, damp cloth over the rest of the wrappers to prevent them from drying out while you work. Fold the bottom and side corners of the wrapper to the middle. Take the bottom corner, and fold it over the filling in the middle. Next, fold the left and right corners over the filling too. You want to end up with a 5-inch (13-cm) wide envelope shape. Roll the wrapper towards the top corner. Keeping the bottom and side corners folded, roll the lumpia towards the top corner to create a tight, 3\u20444-inch (1.9-cm) thick log. Dampen the top corner, then press it down to seal it. Peel the top corner up to reveal the underside. Dip your finger in water, then run it across the corner. Fold the corner back down onto the lumpia, then press it gently to seal it. You should dampen about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the corner, but about finger-width would be fine. Repeat the process for the rest of the filling and wrappers. This is a lot of work, so it would be a good idea to get a family member or friend to help you. Work 1 wrapper at a time, and keep the rest covered with a damp cloth. Set the finished lumpia aside on a baking sheet so that they are ready to fry.

You can keep uncooked lumpia in the freezer for about 3 to 4 months. When you are ready to eat the lumpia, take out however many you wish to eat, then thaw them in the fridge over night. After that, you can fry them. Frying the Lumpia Heat some oil to somewhere between 350 and 375 \u00b0F (177 and 191 \u00b0C). Pour enough frying oil into a deep fryer or skillet to cover your lumpia. Turn the stove or deep fryer on, and allow the oil to heat to 350 to 375 \u00b0F (177 to 191 \u00b0C), about 10 minutes. Use a cooking thermometer to gauge the temperature.
