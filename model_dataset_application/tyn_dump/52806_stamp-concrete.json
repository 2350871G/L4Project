Generally, the area should be stamped so that long lines of the pattern run perpendicular to the length of the project. This will help reduce straight-line errors and provide a more pleasant and aesthetic overall appearance. Typically texture runs in straight lines, even when walks or drives are curved. Always perform a trial run, placing mats in the area prior to the pour. The crew should know ahead of time where the first mat will be placed, as well as aware of areas where a standard mat won't fit, and in what direction stamping will proceed. Always plan accordingly to ensure best results. It is very important to bear in mind the location of expansion and control joints(the thin lines you see in just about everything concrete). These will be required and may disrupt the visual pattern you had planned for. Your installer can direct you more with the options."

Generally 3.5 lbs. of material is required per 100 square feet. As the slab approaches its optimum set for texturing, the release agent should be applied. It should be brushed onto the mats and broadcast across the surface of the concrete. There should be a uniform layer of release between the concrete and the texture mats; thick enough to prevent damp concrete from bleeding through to the mat, yet thin enough so as not to diminish the texture detail."

This process can be adapted to fit specific project needs. Worker 1: Fluffs the release agent throughout the application process. Broadcasts release agent. Identifies areas that require touch up work. Acts as a general helper. Worker 2: Places the texture mats. The first mat should be carefully aligned, placed and tamped in at the starting point of the project. Repeat the process by placing the second mat next to the first. Place mats tightly together to avoid messy grout line patterns. Continue with mats on hand, leapfrogging the mats as they are removed and replaced in the concrete. A minimum of three mats should be used for smaller pours. Larger projects require additional mats. Worker 3: Tamps the mats as they are placed. Mats should be tamped straight down into the concrete using no more force than necessary to press the mat flush to the concrete. Do not over tamp! Worker 4: Carefully removes the tamped mats by lifting gradually from one side first to break the suction. Passes mats to Worker 1 for preparation of next placement."
