Those you choose will depend on how much money you wish to spend, how much and which type of grout you need to remove, and how often you intend to remove grout. You can use power tools. There are a variety of tools, called grout removal tools or re-grout tools, which will help you remove grout quickly and with much less effort. These are helpful if you have a large amount of grout to remove or remove grout often. You can use manual tools as well. If you for some reason cannot use power tools but find that you have a reasonable amount of grout to remove, use a manual grout removal tool. This will look like a small trowel. If you only have a small amount of grout to remove or it is something soft like rubber grout, you can use a standard razor blade, like an exacto knife or a utility knife."

This should include safety glasses, dust mask and cut resistant gloves. For the purpose of comfort, consider wearing knee pads, as it can take a while to remove grout. Make sure to wear pants and boots as well. Carrying Out the Removal Process Make the center incision. Make an incision down the middle of each grout line using a grout saw, preferably one with a carbide blade. Do this to all the grout lines that you want to remove. Remove the grout. Remove the grout from between the pieces of tile with a grout scraper, using the incision as a starting point.

Lightly tap the end of the chisel with the hammer until the grout is loosened. Sweep up the broken pieces of grout from between the crevices using a dust broom or a shop vacuum. Cleaning Up After Removal Remove tape and clean grout lines. Peel off the painter's tape from the edge of the tile, then wash out the grout lines with soap and water.
