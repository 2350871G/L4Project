Since lead melts at 621 \u00b0F (327 \u00b0C), you also need a powerful yet reasonably safe heat source. Popular options include:\nA handheld kitchen blowtorch. These are relatively safe and easy to use for the average DIYer, but using one means you\u2019ll only have one free hand throughout the process. You can pick one up for roughly $20-$50 USD. A propane burner, like those used for outdoor turkey fryers. Turkey fryer models typically integrate the burner into a built-in stand, which makes it easy to rest the melting pan on top. You\u2019ll have less immediate heat control than with a blowtorch, though. Expect to pay around $50-$100 USD. An electric melting pot. These are designed specifically for melting metals like lead and don\u2019t use an open flame, but take longer to do the job than open flame options. They usually cost in the $50-$100 USD range."
