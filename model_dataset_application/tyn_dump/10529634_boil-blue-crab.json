  "text":" Putting the Crabs to \u201cSleep\u201d Fill an empty sink or bucket with ice water. Make sure whatever container you use is large enough to accomodate the crabs as well as the ice water. You want to have enough water and ice to ensure the crabs will be fully submerged. Place the crabs into the ice bath using long metal tongs. Crabs\u2019 claws are sharp and, before you submerge them, the crabs are likely to be active. Be careful not to get pinched. Submerging live crabs in ice water puts them into a dormant state. This makes the boiling process more humane and also makes it easier to place them into the pot to boil. Leave the crabs to sit in the ice bath for 5-10 minutes. This is enough time to put the crabs into their dormant state. Before you remove them, however, you\u2019ll want to make sure that they are inactive. Use long metal tongs to pull one crab out of the ice bath. If it is still moving around, put it back in and add more ice if necessary. Remove the crabs from the ice bath only when you're ready to boil them. You\u2019ll want to make sure the crabs are still in a dormant state when you submerge them in boiling water, so it\u2019s important to have your pot of water ready to go when you take them out of the ice bath. Preparing and Seasoning the Water Fill a large stockpot with water until it\u2019s about \u00be full. You don\u2019t want to overcrowd the crabs, so it\u2019s important to use enough water to submerge them with a little room to spare while they cook. A 5 or 6 gallon stockpot is ideal. Add \u00bd cup of sea salt, 2 sliced lemons, and 3 tbsp of Old Bay seasoning. Stir these ingredients in with the water. This will provide added flavor to the crab and the salt will also increase the boiling point of the water, helping to cook the crab more thoroughly. You may also choose to add garlic, dill, paprika, cumin, and/or other spices. Place the pot over high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. A rolling boil means you\u2019ll see large, active bubbles on the surface of the water. You should also be able to stir the water without disturbing the boil. You\u2019ll want to keep this rolling boil going while you add the crabs and throughout the entire cooking process. Cooking the Crabs Lower the crabs headfirst into the water carefully to avoid splashing. The best way to do this is to take the crabs out of the ice bath one by one using long metal tongs, and gently drop each one into the pot of boiling water. This process is much easier because the crabs are already in a dormant state. Cover the pot and boil the crabs continuously for 15-20 minutes. Keep the pot over high heat and avoid lifting the lid too often. This will help keep the water at a consistent rolling boil and help the crabs cook through. Check the crabs to see if the shells are red and the meat is tender. If you\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re done, pull one crab out and inspect it more closely. To check the meat, simply tear off a claw and crack it open. Take the crabs out of the pot and put them in ice water for 5-10 minutes.
