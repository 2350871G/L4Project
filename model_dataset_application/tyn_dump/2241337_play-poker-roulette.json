  "text":" Assemble the players. Poker roulette requires a minimum of 3 players and a maximum of 5 if you're playing the game with a single deck. For each additional 5 players, you'll need another deck of cards. Each deck of cards used should include both jokers. Determine how suits will rank in the game. Unlike most other poker games, poker roulette requires ties to be broken by suit. Cards are ranked numerically as in most poker games, with aces high and deuces low. Deal each player 1 card, face down. This card is the \"stock\" card, the first card in the players' card stockpiles. Players can look at their stock cards but are not permitted to show them to their opponents. Deal each player 2 cards, face down. These cards are the \"active\" or \"pocket\" cards. Deal a card to the center, face up. This is the match card, to be matched by the players' active cards. Have the players turn over their active cards. Players can add matching active cards to their stockpiles according to these rules:\nIf either active card's suit or number matches that of the match card, the player adds that card to his or her stockpile. If both cards match the active card numerically, the player adds both cards and the match card to the stockpile.
