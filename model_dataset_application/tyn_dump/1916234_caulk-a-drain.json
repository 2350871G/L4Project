Caulking and Putting in the Drain Cut the tip off a tube of caulk with a utility knife. Carefully slice the tip off to make a hole that you can squeeze the caulk out of. Make sure to use silicone bathroom/kitchen/plumbing caulk for your drain to ensure it is waterproof.Warning: Do not use latex caulk because it can become brittle, which will cause the seal to break. It is also prone to problems with mildew and mold. You can get a tube of silicone plumbing caulk at any home improvement store. Insert the tip of the caulk tube into a caulk gun and snap it in place. Put the tip of the caulk tube in the end of the caulk gun furthest from the handle. The rest of the tube will snap easily into place, as long as the tube and the gun are the same size. You can get a caulk gun that fits your caulk tube at a home improvement store. Pull the trigger a few times to prime the tube. Hold the caulk gun at a 45-degree angle over a scrap piece of paper.
