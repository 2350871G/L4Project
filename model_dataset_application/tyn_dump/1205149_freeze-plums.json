Plums should be frozen when they are at the peak of their ripeness, deliciously sweet and flavorful. Don't freeze plums that are a little green or overripe, because they won't have good flavor or texture when you thaw them out. Do a taste test before freezing a batch of plums. Bite into one of the plums. If purply-red juice drips down your chin, and the plum is sweet and flavorful, the rest are probably good to freeze. If it's too tart, or too grainy, you might not want to freeze this batch of plums. If the plums are a little hard, you can leave them at room temperature for a few days to ripen. Freeze them when they are just ripe."

If you're worried about the plums darkening in the freezer, you can toss them with lemon juice, coating their surfaces. The citric acid preserves their color. You may also buy a product you can sprinkle on the fruit to achieve the same effect. If you'd prefer not to cut the plums in half, you still need to remove the core.

To make this, just heat 3 cups of water and add 1 cup of sugar in a saucepan. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves, then cool the solution before you pour it over the plums. Heavy syrup. If you want a very sweet solution, heat 3 cups of water and 2 cups of sugar in a saucepan. Stir until the sugar dissolves, cool the syrup, then pour it over the plums. Fruit juice. Try plum juice, grape juice or apple juice. There's no need to heat it; just pour enough over the plums to cover. Plain sugar. Some people use plain sugar to draw out the plum's juices.
