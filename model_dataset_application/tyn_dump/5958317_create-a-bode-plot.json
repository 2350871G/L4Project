The knob is unlabeled and is located just above the \u201cPRINT\u201d button. Position the cursor so that it lines up with the very top of the CH1 (upper, in orange) wave.  Push the last soft-key (fifth from the top) to select Cursor 2.  Turn the \u201cmulti-function\u201d knob located on the center top of the oscilloscope to move the cursor. Position the cursor so that it lines up with the very top of the CH2 (lower, in blue) wave. On your spreadsheet, record your data: a. Vin \u2013 the voltage reading under Cursor 1 (820 mV in the example above; record this as 0.820 in your spreadsheet) b. dV \u2013 the reading next to \u0394V (20.0 mV in the example above; record this as 0.020 in your spreadsheet) c.
