          "description":"Many pest control companies make special adhesive pads that trap larger invading species, like lizards, so you can get them out of your home without having to hunt for them. Place a few of these traps around the front and back doors, basement windows, ceiling light fixtures, and the perimeter of the garage. Check the traps a couple times a day to see whether they\u2019ve caught anything. Sticky traps use powerful glues that form a strong bond on contact. As a result, it won\u2019t be possible to humanely release the gecko once it wanders onto the pad. If you have small children or pets, be careful not to let them get near the traps you've set."

Run them into a corner, then position a jar or shoebox in front of them and wait for them to dart in before you close the lid. Once you\u2019ve got them contained, take them outside and release them into the wild where they\u2019ll no longer be a nuisance. The occasional lizard sighting doesn\u2019t constitute an infestation, and is usually nothing to worry about. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling any type of reptile."

If you\u2019re swarmed with geckos while gardening or working in your yard, a blast from the water hose will have the same effect. It\u2019s important that the water be room temperature or colder\u2014any warmer and it might not be unpleasant enough to be an effective repellent."

In extreme cases, they may be forced to fumigate the entire house, which will require you to find temporary lodging for a few days.
