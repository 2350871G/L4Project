You can also use a peeler to help scrape off the skins. You may want to wear gloves as you do this to prevent your fingers from staining. Use a steel cutting board, as beet juice can stain wood, plastic, and marble boards. The skin is edible, but it has a very bitter taste that you may not want in your salad."

Lemon dressings, vinaigrettes, and mustard dressings pair well with beets. Kale, arugula, or spinach taste great in a raw beet salad.
