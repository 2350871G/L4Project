Use a double boiler or a metal pot filled with water and a glass bowl to melt the chocolate over low heat. Use a dry oven, set to 110\u00baF (43\u00baC) to melt the chocolate. It will take about an hour to melt using this way. If your oven does not go this low, use the lowest temperature setting and leave the oven door open a little bit."
