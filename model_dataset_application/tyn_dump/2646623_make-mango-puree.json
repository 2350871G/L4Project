  "text":" Preparing the Mangoes Wash the mangoes. Rinse 4 mangoes under running water to get any dirt particles off. Peel and core them. Use a serrated vegetable peeler to remove all of the skin. Cut them in half and try to cut away as much meat from the pit as you can. Cut the mangoes. Cut each mango into small slices or 1 inch (2.54 cm) pieces. Ensuring the fruit is in small pieces will be very helpful in cooking and pureeing. Steaming and Pureeing Prepare the saucepan. Measure and add about a cup of water into a large saucepan. Add a steamer basket in the saucepan so that it fits perfectly. Add the mangoes onto the basket. Ensure that the fruit is spread out through the basket instead of clumped in the middle. Cover the saucepan with a lid. Steam the mangoes. Allow the water to bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and allow the fruit to cook for 5 minutes. Reserve the liquid for pureeing. Allow the mangoes to cool down. Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit for about an additional 5 minutes. You will know when the fruit is properly steamed when you can easily mash it with a fork. Add the mangoes and juice into a food processor. To make it easier for the fruit to puree, add about 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 59 ml) of liquid from the saucepan. Puree the mangoes. Allow the mixture to come to a smooth texture. About halfway through, completely stop the processor and scrap the sides down. For a juice, pour over a strainer to catch any pieces to make it more drinkable. Freezing and Storing Add the mixture to ice cube trays. Using a tablespoon, fill in each ice cube slot just below the rim of the tray. Freeze the puree. Place the ice cube tray(s) in the freezer and allow the mixture to freeze overnight. Prepare freezer bags. Use a permanent marker to jot down what food you made and the current date. Add the fruit cubes to the bags. Remove the cubes from the trays by placing the backs of it under running hot water or gently bending the trays back and forth. Store the bags in the freezer. Frozen baby food will keep for about two months. Any defrosted food will keep in the refrigerator for two days, so only take out as much as you need for the time being.",
