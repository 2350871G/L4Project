If you cannot find pre-chilled hyacinth bulbs, this step is absolutely vital. Store your bulbs in a dark area with temperatures between 35-45\u00ba Fahrenheit. Great examples of these locations include fridges, outdoor sheds, garages, or even potted damp sand. Be careful when storing your bulbs in the fridge. Certain fruits produce ethylene gas that will cause your hyacinth bulbs to rot and/or become sterile. If you decide to cool your bulbs in the fridge, don\u2019t place any fruit in the fridge during the cooling process. Don\u2019t expose bulbs to freezing temperatures, otherwise they will become damaged. Wear gloves when handling hyacinth bulbs, as they can cause a skin irritation."

Pre-chilled hyacinth bulbs can sometimes be a bit more expensive than the non-chilled bulbs, but the time they'll save you will be well with the extra cost."

Hyacinths reach toward sunlight, so turn your vase daily to prevent the plant from leaning in one direction. After 2 weeks or so, your hyacinths will be fully fragrant and bloomed, and should last for another 2 weeks before they begin to wilt. Although you want to move the hyacinth to a brighter location, avoid direct sunlight. To make your bloom last longer, place your hyacinth plant in the refrigerator at night. Enjoy the fragrance of the plant. Once the hyacinth flowers have bloomed, their scent will be beautiful. Throw out the bulbs once the hyacinth has died. Water forcing uses all of the energy that bulbs have to offer, and the bulbs will be too weak to re-bloom. You'll have to get more bulbs to grow more hyacinths."
