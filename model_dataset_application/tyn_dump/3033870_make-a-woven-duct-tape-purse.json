  "text":" Making the Fabric Cut 24 strips of 12-inch (30.48 centimeters) long duct tape, fold them in half lengthwise, and set them aside. This will be for your horizontal stripes. You can use solid colored duct tape or patterned duct tape. Cut 12 strips of 25-inch (63.5 centimeters) long duct tape and fold them in half lengthwise. This will be for your vertical stripes. To make a more interesting looking bag, use a contrasting color. It would not be a good idea to use patterned duct tape for this, because it will make your bag look too busy. Cut a 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) long strip of duct tape, and fold it in half lengthwise with the sticky side out. This will make a crease, which you will later use as a guideline. Use the same color as your long, vertical strips. Place the 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) strip down, sticky-side-up, and start placing the long, vertical strips on top of it. Make sure that the vertical strips do not go past that creased guideline you made earlier. Also, make sure that the vertical strips are placed side-by-side so that their edges are touching. You will have an inch or so of excess duct tape to either side of your vertical strips, which is fine. Fold the rest of the 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) strip of duct tape up to cover the bottoms of the vertical strips. If you'd like, you can trim off any excess tape at this point. Start weaving your horizontal strips through the vertical ones. Weave the strips over and under, from one side to the other.

Alternatively, you can also cut the top into a slightly rounded shape, and then cover the edges with duct tape. This will create the flap part of your purse. Making the Sides Cut 6 strips of 9-inch (22.86 centimeters) long duct tape. Use the same color as the vertical stripes on your bag. Place 3 of those strips, sticky-side-down, on a cutting mat. Overlap the long edges by \u00bc-inch. This will make one side of your duct tape sheet. Putting the tape sticky-side-down prevents the tape from sticking to your fingers while you work, making things easier. Flip the sheet over, and lay down the remaining 3 strips on top. Remember to overlap the long edges by \u00bc-inch (0.64 centimeters). Trim the sheet into a trapezoid-like shape to finish the side panel. Cut the narrow edges down until the sheet is 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) long. Then, cut down the long edges at an angle until the sheet is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) at one end, and 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) at the other end. Repeat the first few steps to make another trapezoid sheet just like this one. Count up 8 rows from the bottom of your weaving, then tape the 4-inch (10.16 centimeters) edge of your side panel over the next four rows. Be sure to use a color that matches the edging and side panel. For extra security, flip the bag over, and place a strip of tape on the back of the seam. Repeat this step for the other side of your bag. If you cut one of the narrow ends of your weaving into a rounded shape, make sure that you start from the other end. Tape up the sides of the bag. Place a strip of tape (about 8 inches/20.32 centimeters long) over the edge of the 8 rows that you counted earlier, so that half of it is sticking out over the edge.

You'll notice that the weaving is longer than your side panels. This is fine; your purse closes with a flap! Adding an Inside Pocket (Optional) Cut 6 strips of 7-inch (17.78 centimeters) long of duct tape. You can use the same color as your lining, or a contrasting one. Place 3 of those strips down in front of you, with the edges overlapping by \u00bc-inch (0.64 centimeters). You might find it easier to place the strips sticky-side-down. This way, the tape won't stick to your fingers as much, and make it easier to work with. Flip the sheet over, and place the remaining 3 strips down on top of it. Remember to overlap the edges by \u00bc-inch (0.64 centimeters). Try to be as neat as possible, especially along the long edges. Don't worry if the narrow, side edges are messy. Trim the sheet down until it is 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) long. Be sure to trim the tape off on both sides. This will get rid of any unevenness. Cut a 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) long strip of tape, and fold it over the top edge of your sheet. This will give you a cleaner edge. You can use the same color as your sheet, or a contrasting on. Tape the pocket to the lining of your purse. Cut 2 strips of tape, about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) long, and use them to tape down the side edges of your pocket. Make sure that the tape does not go past the top of your pocket, or it won't open all the way. Cut another strip of tape, and use it to tape down the bottom edge of your pocket; make sure that it covers the tape you used on the sides as well. Making the Handle and Finishing the Bag Cut 3 long strips of duct tape. These will become your strap, so you can make it as long as you'd like. The color can match either the vertical or horizontal strips you made earlier. Consider measuring the shoulder strap of your favorite bag, and using it as a guide. Place one of the strips down in front of you, sticky-side-up. To keep the strip steady, you can tape it to your table at either end with small pieces of regular tape. Place the other 2 strips down on top of it, sticky-side-down. Each of these strips will be hanging half-way over the edge of your first strip. They should be touching in the center of your first strip, but not overlapping. Flip your handle over, then fold the rest of the tape down. You should now have a 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) wide strip made out of duct tape. At this point, you can trim off any unevenness at either end. Tape each end of the handle to the top of the side panels on your purse. Be sure to apply tape to both the inside and the outside of the purse. Add a Velcro closure. Find the center of the top flap of your bag, and place a Velcro dot or square. Find the corresponding spot on the body of your bag, and place the matching Velcro dot or square on it.",
