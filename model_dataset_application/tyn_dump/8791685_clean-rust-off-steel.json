This method can be messy; work over a sink or outside for easier cleanup. The potato-soap approach to rust removal is most effective on small, light rust stains that are easily accessible."

Squeeze the juice from your cut lemon or lime over the salt. Wait 30 minutes to an hour, then scrub at the rust with the rind of the lemon or lime. Rinse the metal with water and then dry it with a towel. It may take several applications of salt and lemon/lime juice before the rust is removed. Repeat this process as necessary. This method is suitable for light rust stains, especially those on kitchen knives. Use caution when cleaning knives to prevent accidental cuts."

Leave the soda for about an hour, then scour rust away with steel wool, a scouring pad, or a metal bristle brush. Rinse the item with water and dry it with a towel. This technique is most useful for light rust, rust rings, rusty baking pans, and other kinds of thin metal that have developed rust. While scrubbing, use firm, steady pressure. It may take some time before the rust comes free. If rust remains after rinsing, repeat this process until the rust is completely removed.

Raymond Chiu\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Director of Operations, Maid Sailors\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Despite its name, stainless steel can rust if the outer layer becomes damaged. To clean it, create a thick paste by mixing baking soda with a little warm water. Then, apply the paste to a soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth and scrub the rust in the direction of the grain on the stainless steel. Once the rust is removed, rinse the area with water and a clean, soft cloth."

Soak the item in vinegar overnight, then rinse the item in water and dry it with a towel. Larger rusty items may not fit in a bucket. In these situations, saturate rags in white vinegar and wrap these around rusty areas. Leave the rags on overnight, then brush, rinse, and dry the item as per usual. This rust removal technique works well for severe rust, especially on steel tools. Vinegar will not harm the surface or integrity of steel. The longer you leave items in vinegar, the more effective it will be. Soak heavily rusted items for longer periods of time. Repeat this process as necessary to remove stubborn rust."

Avoid soaking items for more than 24 hours. After soaking, use a stiff or wire bristle brush to remove any leftover flakes. Rinse the item in water and dry it with a towel. Citric acid can be purchased at most grocery and health stores. You can usually find it in the canning section. In some cases, citric acid may go by the name \u201csour salt.\u201d\nMost citric acid products are prepared by adding 2 or 3 tbsp (30 to 44 ml) of acid to a moderate amount of hot water in a bucket.
