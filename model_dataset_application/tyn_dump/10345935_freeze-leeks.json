Blanching Your Leeks Get a large pot and a wire blanching basket. While you don\u2019t have to blanch your leeks before freezing, doing so can help your frozen leeks stay fresher and more flavorful for longer. You will need a large cooking pot and a blanching basket or pasta strainer. If you don\u2019t have a blanching basket or strainer, a mesh cooking bag will also work.

You can also gently pat the leeks with a clean, dry kitchen towel to soak up any excess moisture. Freezing your leeks with too much moisture on them can reduce their quality and storage life. Freezing and Storing the Leeks Spread your leeks on a sheet of wax paper on a baking sheet. Place a layer of wax paper or parchment paper on a baking sheet, and place your leeks on it in a single layer. Don\u2019t worry if the leeks touch each other a little, but don\u2019t pile them up, or they may stick together or take longer to freeze. Put the leeks in your freezer for 30 minutes or until they are frozen. Place the tray full of leeks in your freezer and leave them for 20-30 minutes, then check to see if they are frozen. If not, give them some extra time. Gently feel the leeks to check that they feel hard and brittle to the touch. If they are still soft and flexible, leave them in the freezer a bit longer. Transfer the leeks to a freezer-safe container. Once the leeks are frozen, put them in a zipper-top freezer bag or other freezer-safe container. Make sure the container is tightly sealed. Squeeze as much air out of the container as you can. Store leeks for up to 10-12 months in your freezer.
