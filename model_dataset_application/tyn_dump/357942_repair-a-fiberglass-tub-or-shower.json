It should make a soft, hollow, non-metallic sound, and may even flex a bit. A cast iron or steel tub or shower pan will make a metallic, deeper, more solid \u201cclanging\u201d sound.

          "description":"If there\u2019s a small crack or hole due to dropping something or accidentally kicking the tub wall, a fiberglass tub repair kit should work well. However, if the crack is more than about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide or the hole is more than about 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter, consider hiring a professional. A crack that wasn't caused by external damage (like dropping the shampoo bottle) is probably due to poor structural support below the fiberglass. It may be possible to repair this by drilling holes in the fiberglass and injecting a 2-component, low-density foam, but it's usually best to hire a pro. If there\u2019s a hole larger than 1 in (2.5 cm) in the flat bottom of your fiberglass shower pan, it\u2019s possible to repair it by removing the pan, adhering a plywood patch to the underside with epoxy, reinstalling the shower pan, and fixing the hole with a repair kit. Unless you\u2019re experienced with this type of work, though, hire a pro instead."

Most kits come with everything you\u2019ll need, but you may have to purchase some items separately in some cases.

If you have a crack that\u2019s at least 0.125 in (0.32 cm) wide, consider using a rotary tool with an 80-grit sandpaper attachment to create a bevel on either side of the crack.

    "Mixing the Resin Patch Material Set up the kit and familiarize yourself with its mixing instructions.",
    "Once mixed, the resin materials in these kits are meant to harden very quickly\u2014sometimes as fast as 5 minutes.",
    "Different kit brands have different instructions, so read everything carefully so there are no delays or mistakes once you start combining the resin.",
    "If your kit does not come with its own mixing tray or board, grab a scrap of sturdy cardboard that\u2019s about the size of a standard sheet of paper.",
    "Put on your personal protective gear before opening any of the containers or tubes in the kit.",
    "Keep the gear on throughout the process of mixing up and applying the patch material.",
    "Dispense the amount of resin you need, based on the product instructions.",
    "Your selected kit may, for example, instruct you to dispense a quarter (\u00bc) of the resin material for a small crack or hole, half (\u00bd) for a medium crack or hole, or all of the resin for a large crack or hole.",
    "Always over-estimate rather than under-estimate so you don\u2019t need to mix up more resin in the middle of your repair job.",
    "Dispense the resin into the mixing container, if provided.",
    "If your kit doesn\u2019t come with a mixing container, dispense the resin onto your scrap of cardboard.",
    "You\u2019ll be able to mix it up there.",
    "The resin material often has the look and consistency of white toothpaste.",
    "Add colorant, if needed, from the provided tube in the kit.",
    "If you have a standard white fiberglass tub or shower, you likely won\u2019t need to add any colorant (check the kit instructions).",
    "If you do need to add coloring\u2014for instance, to get an almond shade\u2014add the colorant precisely according to the instructions and stir it in thoroughly with the provided stirring stick.",
    "For instance, if you\u2019re using half of the provided amount of resin, the kit may instruct you to use 5 drops of the \u201calmond\u201d colorant to get that finish color.",
    "Do your best to dispense precisely 5 drops from the colorant tube.",
    "You don\u2019t have to rush while stirring in the colorant, because the resin won\u2019t start to harden until you mix in the hardener.",
    "Mix in the thickening agent, if applicable, for vertical repairs.",
    "If you\u2019re making a repair to a vertical surface, such as the side wall of the tub, some repair kits provide a separate thickening agent to stir into the resin.",
    "This will help prevent the mixed resin from running out of the hole or crack before it hardens.",
    "If your kit has a thickener and you\u2019re fixing a vertical surface, mix it in as directed.",
    "Not all kits come with thickeners.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about trying to add a thickener if your kit doesn\u2019t provide one, even if you\u2019re fixing a vertical fiberglass surface.",
    "Stir in the hardener according to the kit\u2019s instructions.",
    "The hardener is typically a thick liquid or thin gel found in a separate, labeled tube.",
    "Add the precise amount directed by the kit, based on the amount of resin you\u2019re using.",
    "If you use too little, the patch may not harden correctly.",
    "If you use too much, it may harden before you\u2019re able to apply it to the tub or shower.",
    "For example, if you\u2019re using one-fourth of the provided resin, you might be instructed to add 5 drops of hardener.",
    "Do your best to add exactly 5 drops in this case.",
    "Stir the mixture with your stirring stick until the hardener is incorporated, but don\u2019t spend excessive time stirring.",
    "You\u2019re now \u201con the clock\u201d for the material to start hardening!",
    "Completing the Repair Fill a smaller crack or hole completely with the patch material.",
    "For a smaller repair that doesn\u2019t require the use of a mesh patch, scoop up about half of the mixed patch material with a stirring stick, tongue depressor, or small putty knife.",
    "Press the material firmly into the crack, then scoop up more material and mound it over the top of the crack so that it\u2019s a bit above the level of the surrounding fiberglass.",
    "If you don\u2019t mound up the patch material now, it will shrink while hardening and end up below the level of the current fiberglass.",
    "In this case, you\u2019ll have to mix up and add more patch material.",
    "Remember to work with a purpose\u2014you may have only 5-10 minutes before the mixture starts to harden!",
    "Surround a larger hole or crack with patch material before adding the mesh.",
    "If you\u2019re using a mesh patch to repair a larger crack or hole, scoop up just enough repair material at this time to create a base layer around the damaged spot.",
    "Make sure you add enough to that you can nestle and adhere the mesh patch in place over the damage.",
    "Mound the remainder of the mixed patch material over the mesh patch once you put it in place.",
    "Stick the mesh, if needed, over the repair spot and cover it with patch material.",
    "With your gloved fingers, gently press the cut piece of fiberglass mesh over the crack or hole.",
    "It should stick in place due to the base layer of patch material you put down.",
    "Then, scoop up more of the patch material and smooth it over and about  0.5 in (1.3 cm) beyond the edges of the mesh patch until the mesh is no longer visible.",
    "Remember to mound up the patch material a little above the surface of the tub or shower.",
    "It will shrink somewhat while hardening, and you\u2019ll be sanding down the hardened patch material anyway.",
    "Sand the hardened patch carefully, after the instructed curing time.",
    "The patch material will likely harden in 10-15 minutes, but the package may instruct you to let it cure for a longer period\u2014for instance, 2 hours\u2014before sanding it.",
    "After this curing time, use the coarsest sandpaper that came with the kit to begin sanding down the patch material.",
    "Use light, even strokes, and be careful not to scratch the surrounding fiberglass.",
    "As the patch material approaches being level with the surrounding fiberglass, switch to sequentially finer grits of sandpaper\u2014your kit may come with 3-4 different sheets, for example.",
    "Use a lighter touch and be more careful as the sandpaper becomes finer, so that you end up with a smooth, even patch job that feels level with the surrounding fiberglass.",
    "If your kit doesn\u2019t come with sandpaper, start with 80-grit and work your way up to 240-grit or higher.",
    "Use finishing polish or buffing compound to add a glossy finish.",
    "Follow your kit\u2019s instructions for specific application procedures.",
    "You might, for instance, add a bit of the finishing polish to a clean rag and buff it into the hardened patch material.",
    "When you\u2019re done, the patch area should have the same glossy appearance as the surrounding fiberglass.",
    "No matter how great of a job you do, you\u2019ll likely be able to see the patched area if you look closely enough.",
    "However, from a distance, it should blend in and be virtually impossible to spot.",
    "Regardless, it\u2019s better than having an obvious crack or hole in your tub or shower!"
