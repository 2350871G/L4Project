Use the shears to cut them off just below the brown or dead area at a 45 degree angle. This will ensure you leave as much of the healthy foliage on the plant as possible. Do not cut off any leaves or limbs that still appear green and vibrant. If a large section of the leafy area appears dead, you can cut off the entire branch. Leave the main stem intact and remove branches shooting off of the stem at a 45 degree angle."

They may also feel dry to the touch. Cut the dead flowers off with the shears at the base of the flower\u2019s head. Removing dead and dying flowers on the plant will encourage the growth of newer, more vibrant blooms."

Use your thumb and forefinger to remove the tip of a stem. Pinch above the node, which is the growing point where the leaf is attached to the plant.
