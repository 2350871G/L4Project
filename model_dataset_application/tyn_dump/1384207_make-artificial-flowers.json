          "description":"Squirt about 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of acrylic or latex paint into a large pan or bowl and stir in \u20442 cup (120 ml) of water until they're combined. Then, stir in 2 cups (470 ml) of water and submerge up to 20 round coffee filters of any size. Keep the filters in the dye for 2 to 3 minutes for pale flowers or up to 15 minutes for bold colored flowers.Tip: Have fun mixing different colors of paint to create several flower colors. For example, tint pink with a little yellow to create coral colored flowers. Keep in mind that if you use larger coffee filters, you can make bigger flowers. If you're making white flowers, you can skip dying the coffee filters."

          "description":"Once the filters are the color you want, use tongs or your fingers to lift them out of the paint. Let the excess paint drip back into the pan and lay the filters on a wire rack. They'll dry faster in a single layer so don't stack the filters on the rack. The filters should dry within 20 or 30 minutes, depending on your climate."

          "description":"Spread 1 of the dried coffee filters flat and use sharp scissors to make it into a spiral shape. The spiral strip should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide as you cut your way to the center of the filter. Once you've finished cutting the spiral, you'll be able to stretch the ends of the filter to make a long skinny strip."

          "description":"Tear off a long piece of masking tape and lay it sticky side up on your work surface. Then, place the end of the filter strip about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the tape's end. You should use the rounded end of the filter so it will become the middle of your flower. In order to make a simple stem for the flower, consider using green masking tape."

Then, keep folding as you move down the tape. Leave space along the top of the masking tape so you'll be able to wrap and seal the stem of the flower. You'll now have a ruffled strip of filter across the length of the masking tape."

Then, wrap the tape around it and keep rolling the straw on the tape until you reach the end of the strip. This will form the ruffled filter flower. If you don't want to use a straw, you can use a thin strip of wire or a plastic stem from old artificial flowers."
