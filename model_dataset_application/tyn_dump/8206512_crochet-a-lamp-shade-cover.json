Make sure that you place some newspaper or plastic down over the area where you will be creating your paper mache lampshade.

However, you may also want to measure the light fixture that you are using to ensure a good fit. Another option is to place the doily lampshade over the top of a lamp in place of a normal lampshade. If you decide to do this, check the top of the lampshade to determine the size of the opening on the top of your lampshade. You can even cover the entire balloon except for a small opening on the top. This will result in a round lampshade that you can use with a light fixture and hang from the ceiling.
