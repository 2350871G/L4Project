Just trim the silky tassels and remove the outer layer of leaves so that only the green inner shell remains. Try not to expose too many of the kernels inside. When left intact, the husk will act as a kind of built-in steamer packet for the corn, leaving it moist and evenly cooked throughout. Heating the husk along with the corn will also dry it out, making it much easier to remove later on."

When you\u2019re done, place the foil-wrapped corn on a rimmed baking sheet. If you want, you can go ahead and brush your corn with about a tablespoon (15 g) of softened butter or sprinkle it with salt and pepper before you close it up. That way, the flavor of your seasonings will cook right in. The extra layer of insulation will make it harder to accidentally overcook your corn. This can be helpful if you\u2019re preparing other dishes and aren't able to watch your corn the whole time it\u2019s in the oven."

Arrange your corn on top in rows, leaving 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) between each ear to ensure consistent cooking. There\u2019s no need to use any additional oil, but it is a good idea to select a nonstick baking sheet in case the corn happens to shift off of the foil while it\u2019s in the oven. Unlike wrapping the entire ear, which locks in moisture, lining your baking sheet will reflect heat while allowing moisture to escape, resulting in deliciously caramelized corn."

Repeat for each ear of corn you plan on cooking, then spread the kernels in a thin, even layer on a foil-lined baking sheet. Roast your corn as-is, or mix it with 1 tablespoon of olive or canola oil and \u00bd a teaspoon each of salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, or other seasonings of choice (per ear) prior to putting it in the oven.
