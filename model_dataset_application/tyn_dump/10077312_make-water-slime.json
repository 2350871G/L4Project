Then, measure out \u20442 cup (120 mL) of water and pour it over the glue in the bowl. Stir the 2 ingredients thoroughly with a spoon until they're fully mixed together. Most bottles of school glue contain 4 ounces (120 mL), which amounts to \u20442 cup (120 mL). If your glue says 4 ounces on the packaging, you can just empty out the whole bottle into the bowl! You can double the recipe and use 1 cup (240 mL) of clear glue and 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Do not use white school glue! Using clear PVA glue is the key to making this slime clear."

Your slime will still be see-through if you add food coloring, but it won't be crystal clear. If you want this, stir in 1-3 drops of blue food coloring with a spoon. If you don't have blue food coloring on hand, then try 1-3 drops of liquid watercolor paint instead.

    "Do not touch or play with the slime during this time.",
    "As the mixture chills in the fridge, it will harden into slime!",
    "You can try speeding the process up by putting the slime into the freezer for 3-4 hours, but the results may not be as good.",
    "Keep the slime in its container when you're not using it.",
    "Because this slime contains very simple ingredients, it probably won't last for more than 2-3 days.",
    "If it starts to lose it's texture, you could try revitalizing it by stirring it back up again, then putting it back into the fridge for 2 days.",
    "If the slime starts to get too runny while you're playing with it, try putting it back into the fridge or freezer for a few hours, and see if that helps.",
    "Easy Slime with Cornstarch and Water Put 1 cup (128 g) of dry cornstarch into a medium-sized bowl.",
    "Use a measuring cup to measure out the cornstarch.",
    "Dump the cornstarch into a mixing bowl.",
    "Use a spoon to break up any clumps of cornstarch in the bowl.",
    "Pour \u20442 cup (120 mL) of warm water into the bowl and stir the mixture.",
    "You'll be adding warm water little by little to create the consistency you want.",
    "You can just go to the tap with a glass and fill it with warm water.",
    "Start adding water to the bowl with a quick splash, say about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of warm water.",
    "Stir the cornstarch and water together thoroughly with a spoon.",
    "As you stir, you will notice the mixture thickening.",
    "Warm water will prevent the cornstarch from clumping.",
    "Add 1-2 drops of food coloring, if desired.",
    "If you want to make colored slime, go ahead and add the food coloring of your choice to the mixture.",
    "You only need 1-2 drops, but you can experiment with adding more or less to achieve the exact shade that you want.",
    "Keep stirring with a spoon and adding water until the mixture gets thick and slime-like.",
    "The exact consistency is up to you, just make sure your slime is thick enough to hold together!",
    "If the slime feels too thin, add a little bit of cornstarch and keep stirring.",
    "If the slime feels too thick, add a little more water.",
    "Scoop out the slime and play with it!",
    "The gooey texture of this slime makes it super fun to play with.",
    "After you're done playing with it, store the slime in a plastic baggie with a zippered top to keep it moist.",
    "You can toss out the slime once it starts to look dirty."
