The style of the shirt you get will depend on where you will be placing the rhinestones. In the end, however, the color and style is completely up to you. For example:\nIf you plan on adding rhinestones to the shoulder area, a fitted t-shirt would work best. If you plan on adding large, chunky rhinestones to the collar area, any style of t-shirt would work, especially one with a large/scooped collar."

    "This is a must if the shirt is brand new, as it will remove any starches and shrinking.",
    "T-shirts typically do not need to be ironed, but if your shirt has a lot of wrinkles in it, it would be a good idea to give it a quick pass with your iron.",
    "Get some lace.",
    "There are two types of lace that would work for this: basic lace and bridal lace.",
    "Basic lace is thin and net-like, while bridal lace usually has a raised or embroidered design.",
    "You can use either type for this project.",
    "Figure out where you want to put the lace, and what shape you want it to be in.",
    "The most popular places for lace trim is across one or both shoulders.",
    "The shapes are usually asymmetric and follow the pattern of the lace.",
    "Another popular design is a basic shape (such as a heart) in the center of the shirt; this only works with basic lace, however.",
    "Trace your design onto the lace, if needed.",
    "If you are using basic lace, you might want to sketch your design onto it using tailor's chalk.",
    "Bridal lace typically comes on a spool and is only a few inches/centimeters wide.",
    "In this case, you simply need to figure out how long you need it to be, then mark it off with sewing pins.",
    "Cut the lace.",
    "If you are using basic lace, you may notice that it has some designs on it (usually roses or leaves).",
    "Cut around these when cutting out your larger shape.",
    "If you are using bridal lace, cut around the raised or embroidered designs instead of straight through them.",
    "Pin the lace to your shirt.",
    "Carefully lay the lace down where you want it to be, then sew it with sewing pins.",
    "Sew or glue the lace down.",
    "Sewing will take more time, but it will last longer.",
    "Gluing is quicker, but the glue will eventually wear off.",
    "It may also cause the fabric to feel a little stiff.",
    "To sew the lace on: choose a thread color that matches the thread, then sew the lace on using a straight stitch as close to the edges as you can.",
    "Remove the sewing pins when you are done.",
    "To glue the lace on: use fabric glue or liquid stitch to glue the lace on bit by bit; this way, the glue won't dry too fast.",
    "Remove the sewing pins as you work.",
    "Adding Lace Hems Get a t-shirt.",
    "The best type of shirt to use for this would be a loose-fitting shirt.",
    "If you want to use a fitted t-shirt, make sure that you get some stretchy lace, or you won't be able to take the shirt on and off.",
    "Wash and dry the shirt.",
    "This is a must if the shirt is new, because it will get rid of any starches and shrinking.",
    "Most t-shirts don't need to be ironed, but if your shirt has lots of wrinkles, it would be a good idea to iron it.",
    "Decide how wide you want the lace hem to be, then add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters.",
    "Your lace hem can be as wide or as narrow as your want it to be, but most shirts have something that is between 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 centimeters).",
    "Once you have decided on the width, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to that measurement.",
    "This will be for the inside hem.",
    "Figure out how long you need the lace to be.",
    "The lace needs to be long enough to wrap around the bottom hem of your shirt, plus a few inches.",
    "Here is what you need to do:\nMeasure across the bottom hem of your shirt, from left to right.",
    "Multiple that number by 2.",
    "This will give you enough lace for the back of your shirt.",
    "Add 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) for the side seams.",
    "Cut the lace according to those measurements, then cut it in half widthwise so that you end up with 2 equal pieces.",
    "Each piece should now be the same length as the bottom hem of your shirt, plus 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).",
    "If your lace has a design on it, consider trimming the side edges to follow that design.",
    "Be careful not to trim more than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) off of either side.",
    "Pin the lace along the inside of the bottom hem.",
    "Tuck the lace inside the shirt so that the hem overlaps it by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).",
    "Pin the lace in place, then flip it over, and repeat the process for the back with the other piece of lace.",
    "Do not turn the shirt inside out for this.",
    "Don't worry if the lace goes past the hem's stitching; you can always trim it down later.",
    "Overlap the side edges of the lace pieces by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then secure them with pins.",
    "You can have the back piece overlapping the front piece, or vice versa.",
    "In either case, make sure that it is the same on both sides (left and right) of the shirt.",
    "Topstitch the lace down.",
    "Most t-shirts will have two lines of topstitching along the hem; try your best to follow one of them using a thread color that matches your shirt.",
    "Remove the sewing pins as you sew.",
    "If the lace has some stretch to it, consider using a stretch stitch instead.",
    "For a more professional finish, use a thread color that matches your shirt, and a bobbin color that matches your lace.",
    "This way, the stitching won't be visible on both sides.",
    "Turn the shirt inside out, and trim off any excess lace, if necessary.",
    "Some shirts have a much narrower bottom hem.",
    "You may have some excess lace peeking over the top of your stitching.",
    "If this is the case, trim that excess lace off as close to the stitching as you can.",
    "When you are done, turn the right-side out.",
    "Wear your shirt.",
    "At this point, your shirt is ready to wear!",
    "If you notice that the lace is starting to fray at the edges, you can seal it with some fray-check glue or clear nail polish.",
    "It would be best to hand-wash this shirt, and to let it hang dry."
