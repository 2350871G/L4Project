          "description":"In order to keep your mat sticky for as long as possible, it's a good idea to clean it regularly. First scrape it off with a plastic scraper, either Cricut brand or any other type of hard plastic scraper. Then wipe an alcohol-free baby wipe or roll a lint roller over the surface. A lint roller is usually stickier than the mat, so it's able to remove any debris that is stuck to the mat. The baby wipes are able to gently wet down the surface and remove debris without damaging the mat."

Put a small amount of dish soap and warm water over the surface and scrub it lightly with a soft brush. Then rinse the surface off with warm water. If you want to use a sponge on the surface, try a Magic Eraser. This type of sponge will be gentle enough on the surface and it is good at removing residue."

However, they can leave a residue, so the mat needs to be cleaned with soap and water after using a degreaser. Using a strong degreaser may diminish the stickiness of the mat. However, you can replenish the stickiness after it is clean and dry."

          "description":"Once clean, put the mat on a drying rack or hang it up so that both sides of it are able to dry completely. Whatever type of cleaning you do, it's important to let the mat dry before using it in the machine again. Any remaining moisture will minimize its stickiness and could damage the machine. Do not use a towel to dry the mat. Rubbing a towel over the sticky surface will cover it with fibers, minimizing its effectiveness."
