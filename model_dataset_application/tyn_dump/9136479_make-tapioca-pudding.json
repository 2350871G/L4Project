Making Quick-Cooking Tapioca Pudding Measure the sugar, tapioca, milk, and egg. Place a medium saucepan on the stove and measure 1\u20443 cup (65 g) of sugar into it. Add 3 tablespoons (28 g) of quick-cooking tapioca and 2 3\u20444 cups (650 ml) of milk. Beat 1 egg and add it to the saucepan.

Making Coconut Milk Tapioca (Vegan) Soak the tapioca in the coconut milk. Pour 2\u2154 cups (630 ml) of coconut milk into a medium saucepan. Stir in  \u2153 cup (50 g) of small pearl tapioca and let it rest for 30 minutes. The tapioca should absorb some of the coconut milk and soften a little. Stir in the sugar and salt.

It may take about 10 minutes for the tapioca pudding to start bubbling. Reduce the heat and simmer the pudding for 15 minutes. Turn the heat down to low and stir the pudding constantly. Keep cooking the tapioca pudding for 15 minutes. It should thicken and the tapioca pearls should turn clear. Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla.
