          "description":"Place the end of the candle around 2 inches (5.1 cm) over the center of the paper you want to seal. Use a lighter or match to set one end alight, and hold it at an angle to allow the flame to melt the wax. While regular candle wax can work for sealing, it will be more brittle and may break open if not handled carefully. Use sealing wax where you can for a much more durable and flexible wax seal. You may be able to find sealing wax candles at your local craft store. Otherwise, you can find them online in a huge array of colors and types. Sealing wax candles can come with wicks built into them, or without a wick at all. If your candle does not have a wick, use a lighter, torch, or another source of heat to melt the wax over the letter."

Slowly rotate the candle, making sure to keep the lit end over your targeted area. Continue melting the wax until you have a puddle around the same size as your stamp. Don\u2019t worry if your wax doesn\u2019t form a perfect circle in the middle of your paper. Pressing the wax seal into it will spread the wax around, and any extra wax around the edges will only give your seal more character!"

Make small circles in the wax with the other end of the candle until it is a uniform shape and thickness. This may be easier if you extinguish the other end of the candle first. If you need more wax to complete the seal, you can always relight it. Once you stop adding wax, it will start solidifying. While you do not need to work at an incredible pace, make sure you do not let the wax set before you can press the seal into it."

As the ice cube melts, it will also create a natural barrier of moisture on the seal, which will make lifting it out of the wax much easier.

As the wax melts, you can use a toothpick or the end of a match to stir it and make sure it all melts together. Using a melting spoon gives you the ability to melt multiple colors of wax at once.
