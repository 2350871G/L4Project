Also, pick up some hollow wall anchors (molly bolts) if your brackets don't come with them and you have plaster ceilings; they should be the same size as the screws that come with your kit. Screws work fine if you're going into wood, but with plaster, you need to anchor the holes with something sturdier. If you're not sure what to get, ask for help at the home improvement store.

However, the end decoration may affect how far you want the brackets out from the window. If the decorations are wide, you may want to place the brackets closer to the width of the window so that there's room for the caps to extend past the brackets. Always hold the rod up to your marks to see if it looks right. If you're going to be doing several windows of the same size, try making a template out of cardboard.

Simply use a screwdriver or drill to tighten them, which will help keep the rod from moving around. Installing a Track for Curtains Find a track bracket specifically for the ceiling. These brackets are a long piece of metal with tiny loops in them for hanging curtains. Opt for one that's 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) wider than your window, allowing the curtain to expand past the edges. You can find these online or at most home improvement stores. If you have plaster ceilings, you'll also need hollow wall anchors (molly bolts) if your kit doesn't come with them. Pick ones that are the same size as the holes in the brackets. These help anchor the screws into the ceiling. If you have a wood ceiling, just screws are fine. Add the braces to the brackets as needed. Some kits come with little braces that you snap into place on the back of the track. Your kit should tell you how to install them, but typically, you just slide them over one edge of the track and pull it toward the other side. Then, you snap it into place by pressing down. Some brackets have little \"arms\" you'll need to pull open and then you can put it in place and close the arms. Spread the brackets out evenly along the track. They can move back and forth. Measure where the anchors will go and place a dot at each one. Hold a tape measure up and mark a spot 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the wall, depending on how far out you want your curtains. Hold the track up at this spot. Center it above the window, using a tape measure as needed to help you find the middle. Once you have the track where you want it, mark where each of the anchors needs to go with a pencil. If you're having trouble holding the track in place and marking at the same time, use painter's tape to temporarily attach it to the ceiling. Take the track down again before drilling the pilot holes. Drill pilot holes for the wall anchors. The pilot holes should be the same size as the anchors. Therefore, if you have a \u20448 in (0.32 cm) anchor, you need a drill bit of the same size. Place the drill against the ceiling, making sure it's perfectly perpendicular. Then, turn the drill on slowly. Let it do the work of drilling the hole as you apply gentle pressure. Make a hole for each place you've marked. Press and screw each anchor into place. Push the anchor into the plaster with your fingers. The teeth on the anchor should catch. Then, use a Phillips head screwdriver or screwdriver bit for your drill to turn the screw to the right. The anchor should be held in place by the teeth. As the drill turns, the metal pieces behind the anchor will tighten up. When it feels tight, you can stop and pull the screw out. Turn the screw to the left to pull it out. You can use the screwdriver or a drill bit, but make sure to reverse the drill to pull it out. Most drills have a \"reverse\" button.

Use your fingers to screw it in a little until it catches, then place the tip of the drill against the tip. Turn the drill on slowly to screw it into place. Repeat the process with each screw until you've done them all and the track is held in place. Insert the curtain hooks into the loops on the track. You should have loops all along the bottom of the track. Start at one end, and grab a hook on one end of the curtain. Put one hook in each loop you see. Make sure not to skip any, as that will leave gaps in your curtains. When you've reached the last loop and hook, you're done. If your curtain doesn't have the hooks, you can insert them in place at the top of the curtain on the back.
