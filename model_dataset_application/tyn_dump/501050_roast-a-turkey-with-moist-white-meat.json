Warning: Never rinse raw turkey before it\u2019s brined, since doing so can spread harmful bacteria around your sink and work area. To rinse the turkey safely after brining it, first wash your sink with hot water and soap and cover the surrounding area with paper towels to prevent splashing. Wash your sink, counter, and utensils again with hot, soapy water after you\u2019re done rinsing the turkey. To drain the cooler itself, open the drain spout so the brine falls directly into the sink."
