If the structure overhanging your patio has exposed rafters, you might decide to wind the lights back and forth along the beams to provide even more illumination. Of course, these aren\u2019t your only options\u2014you could also zig-zag your lights from corner to corner, or run them on just 2-3 sides of the patio.

          "description":"Climb a ladder and stretch a tape measure along each section of the overhanging structure where you plan on hanging lights. Round up the number you get to the nearest \u20442 ft (0.15 m) and write it down on a pad of paper. Then, add each of the individual measurements together. This will tell you the total distance you\u2019ll need to cover. Use caution when scaling and perching on the ladder. Make sure the legs are all resting on a stable surface, and, if possible, have someone else steady it for you while you focus on taking your measurements. String lights are most often sold in strands of a certain number of feet. Calculating the length of your path will help you determine exactly how many boxes of lights you\u2019ll need to buy, effectively eliminating any guesswork. Don\u2019t forget to account for the extra few feet it will take to run the lead end to the nearest wall outlet. Using an old outdoor extension cord could keep you from having to spring for an extra box of lights."

Plug your first strand into the nearest available power source and begin running the cord from one anchor to the next in the desired configuration.

One cool thing about using screw hooks is that you can experiment with multiple hanging patterns using a handful of anchors. You can also change up the configuration as often as you like, since the cords aren't actually fastened down. If you want to be certain that your lights stay put, attach mini carabiners to the holes at the top of each bulb socket, then clip them to the hooks. The weight will help hold the strands in place. As an added benefit, carabiners also make it easier to keep several connected strands in one piece, which is useful if you think you might take your lights down at any point."

    "Thread your light strands through the anchor hooks.",
    "Now all that\u2019s left to do is hang the lights.",
    "Plug your first strand into the nearest available power source and begin running the cord from one anchor to the next in the desired configuration.",
    "Connect additional strands as needed until you\u2019ve covered your chosen path.",
    "One cool thing about using screw hooks is that you can experiment with multiple hanging patterns using a handful of anchors.",
    "You can also change up the configuration as often as you like, since the cords aren't actually fastened down.",
    "If you want to be certain that your lights stay put, attach mini carabiners to the holes at the top of each bulb socket, then clip them to the hooks.",
    "The weight will help hold the strands in place.",
    "As an added benefit, carabiners also make it easier to keep several connected strands in one piece, which is useful if you think you might take your lights down at any point."
