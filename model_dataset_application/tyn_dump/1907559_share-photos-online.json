          "description":"There are many different styles of digital cameras, ranging from low-tech point-and-shoot cameras to high-tech, expensive cameras meant for trained photographers. Also, smartphones today come with quality cameras preinstalled into them. Buy a digital camera at your comfort level. Point-and-shoot digital cameras are usually less than $150, whereas higher quality cameras cost several hundred dollars. Ensure that your digital camera can hold a memory card and that it has a USB cable."

          "headline":"Become familiar with how to get photographs from your digital camera or smartphone to your computer.",
          "description":"There are some common ways to do this: via the memory card, via the USB cable and via the cloud. If you choose to transfer photographs to your computer with the memory card, then you must be sure that your computer has a port for a memory card. If you are not sure, contact your computer's manufacturer. If you have the port, then you will simply insert the memory card into this port. If you want to transfer photographs with the USB cable, give it a test run to make sure it works. Find where to plug the cable into your camera, which is usually near where the battery is located, and then plug the USB into the USB port of your computer. You can also transfer photos from your smartphone to your computer using your USB cable. Plug your smartphone's charging cable into it, and then plug the USB end into a USB port on your computer. iPhones have a cloud, called iCloud, that allows you to sync your photos with your MacBook, if you own one. You will have a Photos app on both your iPhone and your MacBook, and when you take photos with your iPhone, these will automatically update on your MacBook the next time you open the Photos app. Another option is Dropbox, which will be discussed in more detail later. Dropbox uses a cloud system, as well, and as long as you have an account, you can use the app on your smartphone to get the photographs onto your computer via the Dropbox cloud."

          "description":"These will likely ask you if you would like to open the folders on the memory card, camera, or smartphone. When you open the folder of your digital photographs, you can see them in more detail than on your camera screen. This will help you decide which ones you would like to keep and which ones need deleted. You may also receive options such as opening the folder in a particular program. If you anticipate wanting to edit the photos, then open them in a program that will allow you to do that. If you do not want to edit the photos, then a photo viewer will work."

When you edit photos, you can do things such as resize, crop, remove red-eye, and rotate or flip photos. You can also edit settings such as brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation. Save the photos in a place where you can easily find them. Creating a specific folder for those photos is recommended so that you know exactly where they are when you search for them later. Use a common naming system when you rename the photo files. You can number them, name them by event, or use a combination of numbering/naming and dating."

  "text":" Getting Photos from Your Camera to Your Computer Own a digital camera or smartphone. There are many different styles of digital cameras, ranging from low-tech point-and-shoot cameras to high-tech, expensive cameras meant for trained photographers. Also, smartphones today come with quality cameras preinstalled into them. Buy a digital camera at your comfort level. Point-and-shoot digital cameras are usually less than $150, whereas higher quality cameras cost several hundred dollars. Ensure that your digital camera can hold a memory card and that it has a USB cable. Become familiar with how to get photographs from your digital camera or smartphone to your computer. There are some common ways to do this: via the memory card, via the USB cable and via the cloud. If you choose to transfer photographs to your computer with the memory card, then you must be sure that your computer has a port for a memory card. If you are not sure, contact your computer's manufacturer. If you have the port, then you will simply insert the memory card into this port. If you want to transfer photographs with the USB cable, give it a test run to make sure it works. Find where to plug the cable into your camera, which is usually near where the battery is located, and then plug the USB into the USB port of your computer. You can also transfer photos from your smartphone to your computer using your USB cable. Plug your smartphone's charging cable into it, and then plug the USB end into a USB port on your computer. iPhones have a cloud, called iCloud, that allows you to sync your photos with your MacBook, if you own one. You will have a Photos app on both your iPhone and your MacBook, and when you take photos with your iPhone, these will automatically update on your MacBook the next time you open the Photos app. Another option is Dropbox, which will be discussed in more detail later. Dropbox uses a cloud system, as well, and as long as you have an account, you can use the app on your smartphone to get the photographs onto your computer via the Dropbox cloud. Follow the prompts that come up in windows on your computer screen when you have the USB or the memory card inserted. These will likely ask you if you would like to open the folders on the memory card, camera, or smartphone. When you open the folder of your digital photographs, you can see them in more detail than on your camera screen. This will help you decide which ones you would like to keep and which ones need deleted. You may also receive options such as opening the folder in a particular program. If you anticipate wanting to edit the photos, then open them in a program that will allow you to do that. If you do not want to edit the photos, then a photo viewer will work. Save the versions of the photographs that you would like to share online. If you edit the photos, then be sure to save the version that you edited. When you edit photos, you can do things such as resize, crop, remove red-eye, and rotate or flip photos. You can also edit settings such as brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation. Save the photos in a place where you can easily find them. Creating a specific folder for those photos is recommended so that you know exactly where they are when you search for them later. Use a common naming system when you rename the photo files. You can number them, name them by event, or use a combination of numbering/naming and dating. Sharing Photos on Facebook Create an account with Facebook if you do not have one. Visit https://facebook.com and sign up right on that page by filling in the fields it requests. Confirm your email address so that Facebook can verify your account. Follow its prompt to help you find friends via your email address, if you would like, or you can skip this step until you are ready to add friends at another time. Add a profile photo, if you would like, or skip this step until later. Download the Facebook app onto your smartphone, if you do not have it. Then you can share photos directly to Facebook from your smartphone. Search for the app in the App Store, if you have an iPhone, or in the Play Store, if you have an Android phone.

Find the photo folder you need to upload the photos you want to share. You can upload one photo at a time, or you can upload multiple photos at once. If you are using a Windows PC, then use Ctrl + click to highlight more than one photo. If you are using a MacBook, you can use Command + click to highlight multiple photos. Click \u201cOpen\u201d when you have highlighted all of the photos you want to upload. While your photos are uploading, you can give your new photo album a title and a description on the left side of the screen. You can also tag where the photos were taken.

To share a photo from your phone, go to to files in your \u201cCamera Uploads.\u201d Choose the photo you want to share, and tap the square with an arrow pointing straight up out of the top. This will give you a variety of options for sharing the photo directly from the app. Sharing Photos with Google+ Sign up for a Google account, if you do not have one. It is easiest to do this by starting with a Gmail account at https://gmail.com. Follow the steps for signing up by entering the requested information. Locate Google+ once you are logged into your account. In the top right corner, you will notice a grid of squares. Click it, and a number of options should appear in a drop-down menu. Click on the Google+ icon. Set up your Google+ profile if you would like to do so at this time; however, you can skip these steps until later. Once you get to your Google+ home page, click \u201cPhotos\u201d in the \u201cShare what's new\u201d box. Drag and drop the photo you want to upload into the window that appears, and type a message to go with the photo. You can do some minor edits to the photos, including adding text. Share the photos from Google+. You can do this publicly or only to certain people. If you would like to share the photo publicly on your Google+ feed, then that is the default option that appears. Next to where it says \u201cTo:\u201d a green button that says \u201cPublic\u201d will appear. However, you can click the \u201cX\u201d on that button to avoid sharing it publicly and instead enter the individual people or Google+ Circles to whom you would rather send the photo. When you are ready, click the green \u201cShare\u201d button in the bottom left corner.",
