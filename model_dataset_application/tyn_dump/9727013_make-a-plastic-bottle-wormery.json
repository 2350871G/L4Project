If there is any adhesive that won\u2019t come off, apply about 1 tbsp (15 mL) of vegetable oil to the bottle and work it around with your fingers. Then, wash the outside of the bottle with dish soap and warm water to remove the excess oil. Canola, olive, sunflower, or any other type of oil you have on hand will work for this.
