Once it's all combined, you should have a thick paste that drips slowly when you lift the spoon out of the bowl. Cornstarch may be labeled as cornflour in some places, including the UK. If you don't have cornstarch or cornflour, you can substitute rice flour, which you can find at many Asian markets if your local grocery store doesn't carry it."

          "description":"Since you want the colorful powder to have a vibrant shade, plan to use a whole bottle of icing dye for each batch you make. Squeeze in the entire bottle, then stir everything until it's fully combined. You may want to put on gloves to protect your hands from the rich dye. Icing dye is a liquid gel that's thicker and more concentrated than traditional food coloring. If you want to create your own custom-colored powder, try mixing different dyes together, as long as they add up to 1  fl oz (30 mL). For instance, you could mix 1/3 of a bottle of green dye and 2/3 of a bottle of blue dye to make a pretty teal shade."

Then, leave it there for 2 days, or until the surface is cracked and dry. If you live somewhere with very low humidity, it might only take 1 day for it to dry, but plan on leaving it out for 2 days to be sure. In very humid conditions, you might even need 3 days.In a Hurry? Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet, then bake it at 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C) for 1 hour, stirring every 20 minutes. However, your finished powder might be a little clumpier than if you air-dried it."

          "headline":"Preheat your oven to the hottest temperature once the powder is dry.",
          "description":"When your powdered cornstarch has deep cracks running all across the surface, you can place it in the oven to finish drying it. Start by turning your oven to the highest temperature it will go for about 15 minutes. The oven can preheat while you're transferring the powder to the baking sheet."

Try to spread it in a thin, even layer, breaking up the chunks as needed. It may help to use a rubber spatula to spread the powder. A 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) or larger pan will be perfect for this."

Then, place the baking sheet into the oven and leave it in there for about 5 minutes. This will remove any moisture that might be left in the powder.

Keep it in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet, since humidity could cause the powder to become clumpy.Tip: For added convenience, you can use the powder directly from the plastic bags! During the celebration, just grab a handful of powder from the bag, then toss or blow it into the air to create a colorful cloud."
