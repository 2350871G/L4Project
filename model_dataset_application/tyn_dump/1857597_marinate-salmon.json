Creating Gravlax Use this recipe to preserve the salmon to eat raw. Gravlax, also called gravad lax, is a traditional Nordic dish which uses salt and sugar to cure the salmon. Various herbs are used to give flavor to the salmon, typically white pepper and dill, and the salmon is eaten raw after the curing process is finished. Note: because the salmon is never cooked, keeping preparation surfaces and tools especially clean throughout the process is highly recommended. Start with fresh, farm-raised salmon. Use high-quality salmon if possible, acquired from a trustworthy source. Using farm-raised salmon is recommended, due to a lower chance of health issues. Although the chance of parasites is not high to begin with, you can reduce the risk further by freezing the salmon first, then defrosting it. Remove the bones and scales. Use a pair of tweezers or a small knife and fork to remove the scales and bones of the fish. Leave the dark skin beneath the scales attached to the rest of the salmon. Make several shallow cuts in the skin. These cuts allow the spice mixture to soak into the salmon, giving it more flavor and better preservation. Mix the dry ingredients together. Chop up one bunch of dill, or about 8 tbsp (120 mL), and crush 1 tsp (5 mL) white peppercorns. Mix these into 3\u00bc oz (85 g) sugar and 4 oz (120 g) salt. Experienced gravlax chefs will vary the ratios of these ingredients to suit their tastes, but the large quantities of sugar and salt are important so the salmon is properly cured. Cover the spices with salmon. Heap the spice mix onto the salmon fillets, turning the salmon to make sure it is exposed to the mixture on all sides. Weigh down the salmon. Place the salmon in a glass or stainless steel container, touching the salmon fillets together on the pink flesh side, rather than the dark skin side. Cover completely with plastic wrap, then press the fish down with any heavy object, such as a brick. Leave at room temperature for six hours.
