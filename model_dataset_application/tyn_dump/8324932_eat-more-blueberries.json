When you're in the mood for a snack, grab a handful and enjoy. For larger snacks, fill a small bowl or a cup and snack on them over time. You should wash your blueberries in hot water for 30 seconds to kill any bacteria on them. Store your blueberries in well ventilated containers to prevent the buildup of moisture and to get the most out of your blueberries. Blueberries mix well with nuts and granola. For a quick and easy snack, fill a plastic baggie with blueberries, almonds, and granola."

Try blueberries as a side to meat dishes like pork chops, turkey, or shrimp. Blueberries also go well with many kinds of greens. Try blueberries in salads, for example. Blueberries also make a convenient side for lunches. They're a highly portable food, and can easily be brought to work or school in a plastic baggie or plastic container. Whip up a blueberry relish for meat and seafood dishes by combining fresh blueberries with diced, pickled onion, and diced tomato. Create a blueberry flavored dressing for your salad by mixing together fresh blueberries with a little blue cheese in a vinaigrette. Throw together a blueberry loaded fruit salad by mixing together a bowlful of blueberries, cut, fresh watermelon, and peeled orange wedges.Serve this as a side to meals."

You can add the refreshing taste of blueberry to your drink by plopping a few into a fresh glass of fruit juice, like lemonade,  in the summer. Allow the blueberries to soak for about hour before drinking your drink. By allowing your blueberries to soak, your drink will get a dash of extra flavoring. What's more, you'll get to enjoy the juice soaked blueberries at the bottom of your glass. You can mix in other fresh or frozen berries, like strawberries and huckleberries for example, to create delicious flavor combinations. An adult version of this drink can be made by adding a shot of vodka to each glass of fruit juice filled with blueberries and/or other berries."

Blueberries, however, retain their health bolstering antioxidant properties, even after being dried out. These will stay good for long period of time, making them an excellent hiking snack. Dehydrating most fruit has a tendency to concentrate its sugar content. This means that a half cup of fresh blueberries will have fewer calories than a half cup of dried ones.
