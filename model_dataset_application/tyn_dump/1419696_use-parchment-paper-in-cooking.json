          "description":"Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of a baking tray. Make it long enough so that the edges of the paper extend over the lip of the tray 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm). Cut a second piece of parchment paper to go the opposite direction across the tray so that all the edges are covered. Pour the batter in on top of the parchment paper. When the brownies or cake are done cooking, simply lift the parchment paper out of the baking tray to easily remove the baked goods. For a round cake tin, cut a circle of parchment paper for the bottom of the tray, and then grease or butter the sides of the tin like you normally would. To keep the parchment paper itself from slipping, spray just a little bit of cooking spray or add some grease to the corners. This will make the parchment paper stick to the sheet or tray, and it won\u2019t move when you start adding batter or cookies to it."
