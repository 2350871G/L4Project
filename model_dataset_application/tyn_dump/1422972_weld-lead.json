Finish up by putting on a full face shield to cover your head. You can find welding equipment online or at some hardware stores. Also, look for industrial supply stores in your area. Since lead is so toxic, always wear gloves and a respirator when handling it. Wash your hands when you finish welding to avoid skin contamination. Keep your safety gear on the entire time you weld.

Use strong fans to help redirect fumes toward ventilation systems and open doors and windows. Your workspace is well-ventilated when you no longer notice dust or fumes lingering while you weld. Keep other people out of the area until you are done working and have finished airing out your workspace."

If you need to, use a lead knife to cut through the spots you need to remove. Rock the knife back and forth while pushing it down with a steady amount of pressure to cut into the lead. Remove as much debris as you can, exposing the shiny surface underneath it. You could also try soaking the lead in a weak acid like vinegar for extra cleaning power. Submerge it for up to 5 minutes. Scrub the lead afterward to remove the oxidation. Remember to wear gloves and a respirator mask! Even though you aren\u2019t welding yet, the lead is still dangerous to handle."

Use clamps to hold the pieces together as tightly as possible. Add foil tape as needed to keep them stable while you work. To make a butt joint, lay the pieces side by side. Weld the edges where the where the pieces touch. For a lap joint, position one piece on top of the other. The top one will partially overlap the bottom one. Then, weld the overlapping edge to the bottom piece. Make an edge joint by standing the pieces of lead up and pushing them together. Melt the top surfaces to weld them together."

Heat the area until you see the lead begin to melt and a drop of the filler fall onto it. Lead melts takes only about 3 seconds to begin melting.

Continue that pattern by moving your tools forward along the joint by about \u20442 in (1.3 cm). Repeat this process at a steady pace until you reach the end of the joint. Getting the pacing correct is a little tricky and requires practice. Move a consistent pace, spending about 1 second or less on any specific spot on the metal. This leads to a strong, consistent weld. Another option is to hold the welder so the flame is vertical over the lead, which works well for joints that are tough to reach.
