If you don't have a Dutch oven, use a large wok, heavy-bottomed saucepan, or deep fryer. It's best to check the heat of the oil with a fryer thermometer or candy thermometer, but if you don't have one, check by dropping a cube of white bread into the oil. When the oil is hot enough to use, the bread should turn golden in approximately 10 seconds."
