          "description":"Avoid a spot with tree stumps or shrubs that you will have to move. A shady spot will ensure the pool is not exposed to direct sunlight. Sun can encourage algae to grow in your natural pool, forcing your filtration system to work overtime to keep the water clean and clear."

          "headline":"Section out a hole for the pool.",
          "description":"The hole should be at least 45 to 50 square metres (480 to 540 sq ft) and 1 to 2 metres (3.3 to 6.6 ft) deep. Try not to make the pool too deep, as a deeper pool may require steel reinforcements. Make the pool a square or rectangle so it is easy to line and fill. Use tape or chalk to mark out the dimensions of the pool so you have a guideline for when you dig."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create an adjacent hole for the plant zone.",
          "description":"The hole should be 10 to 20 square metres (110 to 220 sq ft) and 1 metre (3.3 ft) deep. This hole is for the plants and other natural elements that will help to filter the water in the pool. It should be right beside the larger hole for the pool. The hole for the plants should take up or be equivalent to 30-50% of the main pool area. The plant zone will be separated from the pool by a piece of black liner that you will put in later. This will allow the water to flow from the plant zone into the pool, but keep the plants from floating into the pool area."

        {
          "headline":"Dig the holes with an excavator.",
          "description":"Using an excavator will make digging the holes much easier and faster. Dig the holes so they have sloped sides, as this will ensure they do not cave in. The holes should also have an even, flat bottom so sealing and filling them are easier to do. Save any large rocks that you come across as you dig, as you can use them later when you seal and fill the pool. You can rent an excavator from your local hardware store at an hourly or daily rate. Digging the holes should take no more than a few hours."

Buy a small water pump at your local hardware store or online. Place it at the far end of the pool and run electricity to the pump so it can run. You can bury the water pump in the ground if you do not want it to be seen. Running a water pump in or around water can be dangerous, so exercise caution when you set it up and make sure the wire you use is water safe. When in doubt, consider hiring an electrician to set up the water pump for you."

Run the PVC tubing underground beneath the entire pool from the far end to the plant zone. Make sure the piping touches the plant zone so the water flows into this area. If you are unsure of how to do this, you can hire a plumber or a contractor to assist you."

Place the aerator in the deepest part or corner of the pool so it is not disturbed. Make sure the aerator is properly connected to the water pump. Underwater aerators can range in price from $1,000-$1,200 USD."

You will need at least 6 pounds (2.7 kg) of clay per square foot to seal the pool. Spread a 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) layer of clay with your hands. Wear gloves and a face mask to protect yourself. If the soil is very sandy, you may need to double the amount of clay per square foot to ensure the pool is properly sealed.

It will also help to protect the pool from leaking. Leave a piece of liner hanging between the pool and the plant zone. Cut the piece so it sits 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below the top edge of the pool. This piece of liner will act as a barrier between the pool and the plant zone. Use scissors to cut the liner so it just drapes over the sides of the pool."

You can then fill in any gaps between the large rocks with smaller rocks or slabs. You can also use stone slabs that have been cut to fit together if you want a smooth, even surface for the sides of the pool. The stone slabs will be heavy to lift so you may need someone to help you lift them in place."
