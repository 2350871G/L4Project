You can also shade around the ground line to make it look like your tree is casting a shadow. Once you finish shading your drawing, you\u2019re finished! Sketching a Winter Tree Draw a trunk with 3 large circles on top of it. To make the trunk, draw 2 vertical lines next to each other that taper in toward the top. When you draw the 3 circles, put 2 on the bottom 1 on the top. Try to make the circles around the same size, but they don\u2019t need to be perfect. You\u2019ll just be using them as a guide when you add the branches to the tree later on. Add 2-3 large branches coming up off the trunk. These will be the big, supporting branches of the tree.

Now that you\u2019ve added the branches, you don\u2019t need the circles as a guide anymore. Be careful erasing so you don\u2019t accidentally erase the branches you drew! Finish your drawing by shading in the trunk and branches. Shade the tree so that one side of the trunk and branches is lighter than the other. That way it will look like the sun is shining on the tree. You can also add the ground that the tree is growing out of by shading in the area underneath the tree. Making a Pine Tree Draw a large, tall triangle. This triangle will be the outline for your pine tree. The exact dimensions don\u2019t matter, but make sure it\u2019s not too short or it won\u2019t look like a real pine tree. If you want your tree to be symmetrical, draw the triangle using a ruler. Make a line through the middle of the triangle and add a small stem. The line should run from the bottom of the triangle to the point at the top.

You\u2019ll be erasing the line later, so don\u2019t worry about making it perfectly straight! Add curved spikes on both sides of the line to make the branches. Draw the spikes so they start at the line in the center of the triangle and extend just past the side of the triangle. Make sure the spikes are curved upward since that\u2019s how the branches on pine trees look. Try to draw an equal number of curved spikes on both sides of the triangle.

Make the waves small so they look like individual pine needles on the branches of the tree. The wavy lines don\u2019t need to be the same on each branch. Drawing them randomly will make your tree look real! Erase all of the unnecessary lines to finish your drawing. Once you\u2019ve finished the branches, you can go back in and erase the original triangle you drew. You can also erase the line down the middle of the tree. Be careful when you\u2019re erasing the lines so you don\u2019t accidentally erase the branches on the tree.",
