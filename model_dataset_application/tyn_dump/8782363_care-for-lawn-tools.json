Linseed oil can combust in extreme temperatures, so dispose of used cloths wisely. Do not ball them up after use. Instead, hang them to air-dry in between uses.

For an even sharper blade, follow up by doing the same with a whetstone. Do so at the start of the spring season so all of your blades are ready to go when you need them.
