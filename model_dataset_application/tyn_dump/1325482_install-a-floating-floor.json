When you do, be sure to nail the shoe molding to the baseboard and not to the flooring to prevent cracking when the floor expands. Troubleshooting Common Problems Cut down casings when your flooring doesn't fit underneath it. If you're trying to install flooring around doors for example, you might find that the floating floor doesn't quite fit beneath the casing. Trim these door casings with a flush-cut dovetail saw if the flooring doesn't fit underneath the casings. To do this, hold the saw flat against a scrap piece of flooring to use as a guide, and press the saw into the casing, gently make the cut. Slide the flooring underneath to make sure that it fits. Scribe around tricky corners or angles. Scribing is a really useful skill to have in your toolkit. It will allow you to make accurate cuts using a compass as a guide. Use a pull bar to help join together tongue and grooves of end pieces. Usually, you can fasted one piece of flooring to its vertical cousin by tapping on the bottom of the end piece. But what if the end piece butts up against a wall, and you don't have the space to tap the tongue and groove together? For this you use a tool called a pull bar, which is a long strip of metal with a tongue on either end going in opposite directions. Just fit the pull bar down into the seam between the end piece and the wall, and then tap on the upward-sticking tongue of the bar to connect the tongue and groove.",
