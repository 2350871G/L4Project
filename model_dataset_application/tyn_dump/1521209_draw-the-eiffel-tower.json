Use a pencil and ruler to make a straight vertical line in the center of the page to use as your guide. Since the Eiffel Tower is symmetrical, it will look the same on both sides of the line. Make sure there\u2019s a small gap between the top and bottom of the page and the center line so you have room to draw the tip and legs of the tower. Work lightly so you can easily erase your marks if you make a mistake.

    "Add an X-shape between each of the horizontal lines you just drew to make the cross supports.",
    "Make sure the ends of the X extend into the corners of the space so it looks like they\u2019re connected to the tower.Tip: Draw the lines of the X lightly as you\u2019re close to the tip and darker as you get closer to the bottom.",
    "That will help give the illusion that the tip is further away than the base.",
    "Sketch lines inside of the archway to add the supports.",
    "The direction you draw your lines depends on where it is along the arch since you\u2019re drawing in perspective.",
    "Start by drawing a straight vertical line between the 2 curves of the arch so it\u2019s along the center guide.",
    "As you add lines along the arch, angle them in toward the center.",
    "The lines near the bottom of the arch will be nearly horizontal.",
    "When you\u2019re finished, you should have about 6 evenly spaced lines on each side of the guide.",
    "If you want to add more depth to your drawing, make small rectangles instead of single lines.",
    "That way, the supports will look three-dimensional.",
    "Put a rounded square on top of the tower to add the point.",
    "At the top of your tower, make a square with rounded corners so it extends slightly out from the tip.",
    "Don\u2019t overlap any lines with parts of the tower you already drew or else the drawing will look messy.",
    "Once you have the point on top of the tower, your drawing\u2019s finished!",
    "Finished."
