          "description":"For boneless center-cut pork chops, set the oven to an even 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). If you\u2019re preparing thicker bone-in chops, increase the temperature to 475 \u00b0F (246 \u00b0C) to ensure that they get done all the way through. If your oven has a convection setting, select it rather than standard bake. Convection baking allows heat to circulate better, which will help your chops cook quicker and more evenly. Make sure frozen chops have had a chance to thaw completely before you begin cooking."

Place the chops on a large serving plate, then sprinkle them with flavorings like minced garlic, parmesan cheese, oregano, or red pepper flakes. You could also keep things simple with a dash of kosher salt and coarse ground black pepper. Rub or brush the pork chops with about a tablespoon of oil to help your seasonings stick."

They should begin to brown lightly around the edges after about 10 minutes. A good general rule of thumb when making pork chops is that they need about 7 minutes of cooking time per \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of thickness.

Then, put them back in the oven until they take on a warm brown color and glisten with juice. The chops typically won\u2019t need quite as long on the second side, since they\u2019ll already be partially cooked.

Slide the tip of the thermometer into the thickest portion of the chop, usually somewhere near the middle, then wait 30 seconds to get an accurate reading. Pork needs to be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) in order to be eaten safely.

Add salt, whole peppercorns, whole cloves, garlic, star anise, lemon rinds, or other pungent spices to taste and stir until they\u2019re evenly distributed. Add the pork chops and leave them in the refrigerator for 1-12 hours to absorb the brine. For maximum flavor, let your chops marinate overnight. Pork chops have a tendency to dry out when cooked over intense direct heat. Brining will keep them nice, tender and juicy and give you a little room for error when it comes to getting them done."

Scour the grate with a grill brush to remove stuck-on char and other gunk before adding the pork chops. If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, go easy on the lighter fluid.

Take a peek at their progress periodically by lifting one corner with a meat fork. You\u2019re looking for a deep brown coloration and dark grill marks. It's important to leave the chops uncovered while they're grilling. Covering them will expose them to too much surrounding heat, which can cause them to become tough."

          "description":"Use your meat fork or tongs to turn the chops over to the opposite side, keeping them on the hot end of the grill for now. After a few short minutes, they should have a consistent color and texture on both sides. It will usually take 2-3 minutes less on the second side. The pork chops will sear more quickly once they\u2019ve been turned, so watch them closely to avoid burning them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Move the chops to the cool side of the grill.",
          "description":"Once the pork chops have a nice outer layer of char, slide them away from the lit burners or charcoals. The surrounding heat on the opposite end of the grill will be enough to finish cooking them through without burning them to a crisp. If the chops nearest to the hot side of the grill appear to be getting done faster than the others, they made need to trade places with the ones that are furthest away to keep the temperature even."

          "description":"This time, lower the grill cover to provide some extra heat. Avoid stabbing, pressing, or repositioning the chops while they finish cooking. Once the juices run clear and the chops are criss-crossed with grill marks, remove them from the heat and transfer them to a large serving platter to cool. When you cut into the chops, they should be a pale white color with just a hint of pink in the center. If there\u2019s any doubt about whether they\u2019re done enough, check the internal temperature with your meat thermometer, looking for a reading of 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) or higher."

          "description":"Grilled pork chops eat much like a steak, so feel free to slather on your favorite grill sauce, or enjoy them with just a light sprinkle of salt and pepper. Pair them with flavorful sides like sauted asparagus, mixed green salad, burgundy mushrooms, a loaded baked potato for a hearty, satisfying meal. Chimichurri and horseradish cream also make popular condiments for accompanying grilled pork chops.

Sift the pork chops through the flour mixture until they\u2019re lightly dusted, then dip them in the egg wash before running them back through the flour for a thicker coating.

    "Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days and reheated in the oven at a medium temperature.",
    "Making Grilled Pork Chops Brine the pork chops to lock in moisture.",
    "Combine 1\u20132 US quarts (950\u20131,890 ml) of warm water with the desired quantity of molasses or brown sugar in a large open container.",
    "Add salt, whole peppercorns, whole cloves, garlic, star anise, lemon rinds, or other pungent spices to taste and stir until they\u2019re evenly distributed.",
    "Add the pork chops and leave them in the refrigerator for 1-12 hours to absorb the brine.",
    "For maximum flavor, let your chops marinate overnight.",
    "Pork chops have a tendency to dry out when cooked over intense direct heat.",
    "Brining will keep them nice, tender and juicy and give you a little room for error when it comes to getting them done.",
    "Fire up the grill.",
    "Light the burners or heap the charcoals on only one side of the grill.",
    "This creates different heating zones that offer you more control over the doneness of the chops.",
    "Scour the grate with a grill brush to remove stuck-on char and other gunk before adding the pork chops.",
    "If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, go easy on the lighter fluid.",
    "Too much can affect the flavor of the meat.",
    "Grill the pork chops uncovered for 5-7 minutes.",
    "Arrange the chops 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) apart around the hot side of the grill and sear them just long enough to give the underside a crisp, flame-kissed crust.",
    "Take a peek at their progress periodically by lifting one corner with a meat fork.",
    "You\u2019re looking for a deep brown coloration and dark grill marks.",
    "It's important to leave the chops uncovered while they're grilling.",
    "Covering them will expose them to too much surrounding heat, which can cause them to become tough.",
    "Flip the chops and grill for another 3-5 minutes.",
    "Use your meat fork or tongs to turn the chops over to the opposite side, keeping them on the hot end of the grill for now.",
    "After a few short minutes, they should have a consistent color and texture on both sides.",
    "It will usually take 2-3 minutes less on the second side.",
    "The pork chops will sear more quickly once they\u2019ve been turned, so watch them closely to avoid burning them.",
    "Move the chops to the cool side of the grill.",
    "Once the pork chops have a nice outer layer of char, slide them away from the lit burners or charcoals.",
    "The surrounding heat on the opposite end of the grill will be enough to finish cooking them through without burning them to a crisp.",
    "If the chops nearest to the hot side of the grill appear to be getting done faster than the others, they made need to trade places with the ones that are furthest away to keep the temperature even.",
    "Continue grilling the chops until they\u2019re done.",
    "This time, lower the grill cover to provide some extra heat.",
    "Avoid stabbing, pressing, or repositioning the chops while they finish cooking.",
    "Once the juices run clear and the chops are criss-crossed with grill marks, remove them from the heat and transfer them to a large serving platter to cool.",
    "When you cut into the chops, they should be a pale white color with just a hint of pink in the center.",
    "If there\u2019s any doubt about whether they\u2019re done enough, check the internal temperature with your meat thermometer, looking for a reading of 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) or higher.",
    "Serve grilled pork chops hot off the grill.",
    "Grilled pork chops eat much like a steak, so feel free to slather on your favorite grill sauce, or enjoy them with just a light sprinkle of salt and pepper.",
    "Pair them with flavorful sides like sauted asparagus, mixed green salad, burgundy mushrooms, a loaded baked potato for a hearty, satisfying meal.",
    "Chimichurri and horseradish cream also make popular condiments for accompanying grilled pork chops.",
    "Reheat your leftovers in the oven or give them a few minutes in a hot pan, and try to use them within 3-4 days.",
    "Making Fried Pork Chops Pound the pork chops flat.",
    "Lay out the chops on your countertop or a sturdy cutting board and whack them all over with a meat tenderizer.",
    "Flip the chops and repeat on the opposite side, being sure to the pound out the entire surface, including the fatty outer edges.",
    "They should slim down to about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick by the time you're done.",
    "A thorough pounding will soften up the chops and increase their overall surface area, which will allow them to cook faster in the hot pan without the risk of burning.",
    "You can also wrap your chops in plastic wrap or wax paper and flatten them with a rolling pin.",
    "Bread the pork chops (optional).",
    "If you prefer your chops to have a crispier texture, you can dredge them before you put them in the pan.",
    "Set out a pair of mixing bowls, one filled with whole beaten eggs and the other with seasoned all-purpose flour.",
    "Sift the pork chops through the flour mixture until they\u2019re lightly dusted, then dip them in the egg wash before running them back through the flour for a thicker coating.",
    "Try seasoning your breading with salt, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, or one of your own favorite spice blends.",
    "Dredge the chops in panko crumbs rather than flour on the second go-around for a delightfully crunchy finish.",
    "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet.",
    "Add the oil to the skillet, then turn on the cooktop to a medium-high heat.",
    "Tilt the skillet as the oil heats up to coat the outer edges of the cooking surface and prevent sticking.",
    "For optimal heating, the oil should sit about \u20444\u2013\u20442 inch (0.64\u20131.27 cm) deep on the bottom of the skillet.",
    "Mix a pat of butter in with the cooking oil for a richer, more savory flavor.",
    "Cook the pork chops for 3-4 minutes on the first side.",
    "The oil will be piping hot by this point, so place the chops in the pan carefully to limit splattering.",
    "Let them sizzle until you notice the underside beginning to brown.",
    "In the meantime, avoid moving them around too much.",
    "It may be necessary to cook multiple pork chops in individual batches if you\u2019ve got a crowd to feed.",

    "She has catered events and hosted pop-up dinners in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 5 years.",
    "VT\t\t\t\t\tVanna Tran\t\t\tExperienced Cook\t\t\t\tVanna Tran, experienced cook, advises: \"If frying multiple pieces, be sure not to crowd too many in one pan, as doing so will make it more difficult to achieve a nice, brown crust.\"",
    "Turn the chops and fry for 2-3 more minutes until done.",
    "Use a long-handled pair of tongs or meat fork to flip the meat.",
    "Continue cooking them until they achieve the perfect crisp, reddish-brown exterior.",
    "Breaded chops will have a mouthwatering golden-brown color when they\u2019re just right.",
    "If you\u2019re unsure whether your breaded pork chops are done enough, use a meat thermometer to take their temperature near the center.",
    "You should get a reading between 145\u2013160 \u00b0F (63\u201371 \u00b0C).",
    "Keep a close eye on the chops to avoid burning them.",
    "They may not take as long to cook on the second side.",
    "Savor fried pork chops with other comfort food staples.",
    "No plate of crispy, golden-brown pork chops is complete with a mound of buttery mashed potatoes or a pot of green beans stewed with bacon.",
    "If you'd prefer a lighter touch to offset all the oil used for cooking, steam try steaming some fresh seasonal veggies, or slice and salt a large ripe tomato and call it a day.",
    "Southern-style sides like macaroni and cheese, corn bread muffins, and collard greens also make a great combination with fried pork chops.",
    "Breaded chops become soggy when they're reheated, which means this type of dish is best devoured hot and fresh."
