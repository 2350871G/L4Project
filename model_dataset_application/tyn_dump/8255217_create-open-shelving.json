You should choose the kind of the shelving most suitable for your home. In most cases, pre-made open shelving consists of a plank or baseboard, brackets for securing the plank or baseboard in place, and screws to fasten the brackets and plank or baseboard into place. If you cannot find the type of shelving you want, then you can also buy wood planks cut to your specifications at a big box hardware store. Then, apply a coat of stain or paint to make it the color you want."

Fit the pipe together in a rectangular shape by screwing the pipe together so it can accommodate a 2X4 plank of wood (or some other suitable piece of wood to use as the shelf base). When you've screwed together your piping frame, you should reinforce connecting pieces of pipe with zip-ties so it does not come loose over time. After you've finished your pipe shelving, you can use simple hooks or wall hangers in the wall to support your shelf. The metal used in making this shelf can be quite heavy.

Once these are installed, you can fasten your shelf to the wall by sinking fasteners, like screws, through the shelf into the anchors. The materials you make your shelf out of and things you store on it will dictate whether or not your shelves require only fasteners or fasteners supported by anchors. For example:\nIf your shelving is light and you intend on holding light items on it, like knickknacks and utensils, it isn\u2019t likely your shelving will need any support beyond screws. Keep in mind that drywall will not hold much weight. Figure out how much weight your wall mounted shelves will hold and make sure that it is more than the weight of items you want to place on them.
