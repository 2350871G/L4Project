Once the ingredients are inside your blender, seal the top firmly in place and plug it in. Especially when making a double batch, try not to pack ingredients too densely into your blender.

Try to run your blender in short intervals, as this will help keep its motor from burning out. Blend until the mixture is a smooth consistency. If your blender is too densely packed and the blades won't turn and blend, unplug it and use a spoon to remove some of the contents. Then reseal it, plug it in, and try again."

Generally, you can expect most smoothies to stay good for 12 hours to a day after being prepared, so long as they are adequately sealed and stored in the refrigerator."
