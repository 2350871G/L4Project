Place the pattern on the backside of the laminate, making sure to flip the pattern, so your cut laminate is positioned to come out correctly when the plank is flipped face up. Hold the jigsaw vertical, so the blade runs smoothly from one edge of the laminate to the other. If cutting the laminate face up, place painter's tape on the laminate along the pattern to keep it from chipping. Mark the cut line on top of the tape and cut with a jigsaw with a special blade."
