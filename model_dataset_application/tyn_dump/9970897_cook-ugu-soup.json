  "text":" Blanching the Pumpkin Leaves Wash off the leaves. Run the leaves under cold water from your faucet. This will remove any grit, dirt, or pesticides that may be left over on the leaves. Pat the leaves dry with paper towels before moving onto the next step. If you don\u2019t rinse the leaves, your soup may taste gritty or sandy. Cut off hard stems and flowers from the leaves. The flowers on the pumpkin leaves taste bitter and the stems are hard an inedible. Use a sharp kitchen knife or kitchen shears to strip the leaves bare. Dice the pumpkin leaves. Line the leaves up on a cutting board or flat surface and cut the leaves into 1 by 1 inch (2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm) pieces. Set the leaves aside and move onto the next step. Be careful when cutting the leaves so that you don't cut yourself. Boil the leaves for 2-3 minutes. Fill a pot with water and place it on your stovetop.

They are now blanched and prepared to be incorporated into the soup. The leaves should still be somewhat firm. Making Ugu Stock Place your proteins in a large stockpot. Find a pot with a lid that\u2019s able to hold at least 10 cups (2,400 ml) of liquid. Place the protein of your choice in the pot and place it on the stovetop. Remove all bones from the protein before you cook it. Chicken will create a lighter, clearer stock than beef. Add 3 cups (710 ml) of water to the pot. Measure out 3 cups (710 ml) of water with a measuring cup and pour it over the protein. Season the water with a pinch of salt. You will later use the protein in the soup itself, so leave it in the stock. Cook the stock on medium heat for 25 minutes. Put a lid on top of the pot and stir the stock every 5-7 minutes. As the fat from the protein rises to the top of the soup, scrape it off with a spoon and dispose of it. The water will start to cook the protein and incorporate the flavor of the meat to the stock. Add your stockfish to the pot and cook it for another 5 minutes. Continue cooking the stock on medium heat while stirring it. Once you\u2019re done, you can prepare the rest of the soup or you store the stock in the freezer or refrigerator. You can store ugu stock in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Stockfish are dried unsalted fish. Preparing Ugu Soup Toast peanuts in a saucepan. Take the 8 ounces (230 g) of skinless peanuts and put them in a dry pan. Turn the heat to medium-high and stir the nuts for 1-2 minutes. They should start to brown and let off a toasty fragrance. Do not cook the peanuts for more than 2 minutes because they are very easy to burn. Blend peanuts, 4 cloves of garlic, and half of an onion together. Place the ingredients in a food processor.
