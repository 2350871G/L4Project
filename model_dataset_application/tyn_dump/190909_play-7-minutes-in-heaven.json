This is particularly important because there can be many different variations of 7 Minutes in Heaven. Generally, the rules include:\nSelecting two people at random. Sending the chosen two into the room for a private 7 minutes. Don't forget to close the door! Letting the chosen two out of the room at the end of 7 minutes. You might also create \"house rules\" when you play, like \"the lights have to be on/off\" or \"no watches or cell phones allowed in the room.\" To prevent anyone from feeling uncomfortable, you may want to make a rule that no one has to go into the room unless they want to."

You might spin a  bottle to randomly select two people or draw names from a hat. If you want to ensure that a boy and girl each are sent into the room, you could arrange your lottery by gender. To split your lottery by gender, you might spin the bottle once for the boys and another time for the girls. The person the bottle points to in each group will be sent to the room. When drawing names from a hat or container, you might have one container for girls and one for boys. Each round of the game, you can select one name from each."

A timer with a dramatic alert, like a siren, can add to the atmosphere of this game while helping you keep track of time. When the timer is up, knock on the door and let the chosen two know that it's time to come out. Then you can select two new players with your random lottery.

If you don't, the other player might misinterpret the signals you are setting and go too far. You might say something like, \"Can we just talk?\" or \"Let's talk first.

When this happens, you should use straightforward language to tell the other player that you feel uncomfortable and want to stop. For example, if you are touched in a way you don't like, you could say, \"No. I don't want to be touched there.\" It can be difficult telling someone \"No,\" but if you don't, things might go farther than you intended.
