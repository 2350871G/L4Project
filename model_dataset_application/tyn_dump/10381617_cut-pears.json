          "description":"Whether you're peeling the pear or not, it's important to wash the skin to remove any dirt or bacteria that might be on the fruit's surface. You may want to use your fingers or a vegetable brush to gently scrub the surface of the peel to ensure it gets clean. Using warm or hot water may change the texture of the pear."

          "description":"On many pears, the peel is thick and not necessarily pleasant to eat, even though it contains a lot of nutrients. If you want to peel the pear, hold the pear in one hand and the fruit peeler in the other, then drag the peeler down the pear vertically to remove the skin. Continue working all the way around the pear. If you like, once you remove the skin from the pear, you can use the peeler to smooth out any rough edges."

          "headline":"Place the pear on a cutting board and slice the pear in half vertically.",
          "description":"Carefully use a sharp knife to slice the pear from the stem to the bottom. You can easily slice through a pear\u2019s core, much like an apple. Using a cutting board will help ensure you don\u2019t damage your countertop with the knife. In addition, it will protect your knife from becoming dull, especially if your counters are made from a hard surface like tile or granite."

          "headline":"Cut a V-shape in the bottom of each half of the pear to remove the calyx.",
          "description":"Use the tip of your knife to cut a small notch around the woody portion at the bottom of both halves of the pear to remove it. This portion of the pear has a tough texture and is not usually eaten. The calyx is part of the pear\u2019s flower that stays attached after the fruit is formed."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use your knife to help you pull off the stem and its string.",
          "description":"Hold the stem against the flat edge of the knife with your thumb, being very careful not to cut yourself. Pull the stem away gently, pulling upward so the stringy flesh attached to the stem comes away as well. If the string doesn\u2019t come off with the stem, you can just pull it away by hand. In most cases, the stem will only be present on one half of the pear, although both halves may contain the string."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Scoop out the core from both halves with a spoon or melon baller.",
          "description":"The core is a small round area in the middle of the fullest part of the pear, and it contains the seeds. It will have a slightly different texture if you touch the pear\u2019s flesh, and it may look slightly more matte, while the rest of the pear will appear more juicy. Discard the core that you remove from the pear. If you\u2019re serving pear halves, the hole left by the core is perfect for filling with caramel, cheese, or whipped cream."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Turn the pear halves flat-side down and cut them into slices.",
          "description":"For longer slices, make vertical cuts, or cut the pear halves horizontally if you want smaller slices. You can slice the pears as thin or as thick as you want them to be. By placing the flat, cut side of the pears face-down, it will be less likely to shift as you\u2019re cutting it. This will result in more even cuts, and it will reduce your chances of accidentally cutting yourself."
