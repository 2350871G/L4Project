          "description":"A croquis is a simple human figure that fashion designers use to sketch their designs onto. If you want to draw your blouse design, start by creating a human figure on a 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) piece of paper. You can divide the paper into 1 in (2.5 cm) sections starting from the top to help you draw the croquis. For example, you can position the head of the croquis at the center of the page between lines 1 and 2, then draw the neck and shoulders between lines 2 and 3. A croquis is often slim, but you can draw the croquis to suit any body type you will be designing your blouse for."

          "description":"Sketch the basic shape you want the blouse to have, how tight or loose you want the blouse to be, and how long you want your blouse to be. Some things to consider as you outline the blouse include:\nStyle. Asymmetrical, off-the-shoulder, jacket-style, t-shirt style, and strapless are just a few of the style options that you have for your blouse. Look at blouse styles to get more ideas and inspiration for your design. Fit. Your blouse can be loose, somewhat fitted, or stretchy so that it conforms to every curve of the wearer\u2019s body. Decide what type of fit you\u2019d like to create. Length. A few basic options include a blouse that is cropped above the belly button, sitting at the natural waist, falling down around the hips, or a tunic-length blouse that is even longer. However, you can create a blouse that is somewhere in between these lengths."

          "headline":"Sketch the neck, sleeves, and back of the blouse.",
          "description":"Once you have decided on a basic style for your blouse, think about how you plan to cut the other parts of the blouse. Add details to your sketch for the neckline, the sleeves, and the back of the blouse. Some popular choices include sweetheart (a heart-shaped neckline that frames the cleavage,) halter, scoop neck, v-neck, square neck, and criss-cross necklines (where strands of fabric overlap each other to form an X in the front of the top.) Sleeves can be short or long. You could create a blouse that is sleeveless, cap sleeve, short-sleeve, 3/4 length sleeve, or long sleeve. The sleeves may be loose or form-fitting. The back of the blouse may be closed or open. You could opt for a small keyhole cutout, or have a more dramatic opening in the back of the blouse, such as a deep v-style back."

You can use any type of fabric that you like for the blouse depending on how you want it to look. You can opt for layers of opaque and sheer fabric to create a blouse with an intricately layered look, or select 1 type of opaque or sheer fabric to make your design. Embellishments may include beads, sequins, or jewels that you sew or glue onto the finished blouse, such as around the neckline, sleeves, or back of the blouse. Make notes about what you\u2019d like to add to your finished blouse to embellish it. You can secure a blouse with buttons, zippers, hook and eye closures, or cording depending on the look you are going for. Indicate on your design what type of closures you will use to secure the opening of the blouse."

Use a tape measure to get measurements for the bust, waist, hips, and arms to ensure that your blouse will fit the wearer properly. Use these measurements to help you shape the dimensions of your blouse. For example, if you want to create a blouse that will fit someone who is a size 14-16 US or XL, then identify the measurements you will need to use and scale the pattern to those measurements. This may result in a blouse that measures 40 in (100 cm) around the bust, 36 in (91 cm) around the waist, and 42 in (110 cm) around the hips. You may also find it helpful to use an adjustable dress form set to the desired size or a human model in the desired size. This way you can check your pattern pieces on the form or model as you go."

Make sure that you line up your pieces with the right (print or outer) sides facing each other. This will ensure that the seams will be hidden on the inside of your blouse.
