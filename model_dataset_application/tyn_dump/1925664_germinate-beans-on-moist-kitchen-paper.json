  "text":" Things you'll need: 2 plastic rectangular boxes of the same size (about 2.5 inch (63 mm) high), kitchen paper, satay sticks (also known as skewers). Boxes on the photo are about 7 x 4.5 x 2.5 inch (6.4 cm). Make germination box: Use a pin to prick small holes at 4 corners, about 12 mm (0.5 inch) from top and from side. Drill holes at those positions. Put in satay sticks. Shorten satay sticks using scissors. Fold kitchen paper to 6 layers. If needed, trim with scissors to fit in the box. (Alternately, cut 6 sheets of kitchen paper that fit in the box and lay them on each other.) Lay dry kitchen paper in the box.  Moisten kitchen paper by adding cold tap water in the box. Water height: 1/8 \u2013 \u00bc inch (3 \u2013 6 mm) above paper. Hold the box slanting to remove water. Stop water removal when water flow starts dripping. Lay dry bean seeds on moist kitchen paper. Distance between seeds, see photo. Write info on a sheet of writing paper. Fasten the sheet with a staple to the satay stick. Put an empty box on top of the satay sticks (which allows air to circulate between the boxes). This box serves as a lid and minimizes water evaporation. Put the system in a room at 68 to 77 degrees F (20 to 25 C).  Regularly check water level as follows: Hold the box somewhat slanted. Water level is okay when a little water appears in the corner within 2 to 10 seconds. When water level is too low, pour some tap water on the moist paper. When there are big bean plants, add some water to the box to moisten paper and germinated seed to ease removal. Pick out some big bean plants. Bean plants picked.  Loosen the soil in the garden. Make small holes in the soil. Put bean plants in the holes. Water the plants. Rake the soil around the plants (about one hour after planting).  Grown bean plants, 24 hrs after planting.  You can put the bean plants in the soil at any (not freezing) weather: dry, sunny, rainy, cold, warm, hot. Always water and rake after planting.",
