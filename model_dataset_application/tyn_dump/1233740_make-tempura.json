  "text":" Making the batter Place about a cup of ice water in a medium-sized mixing bowl.  Stir in one large egg. Remove the egg from the refrigerator just before adding, as the egg should be well-chilled. Stir 3/4 cup of flour and 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda into the egg mixture.  Mix the batter lightly and don't worry about a few small lumps of unmixed flour. Too much mixing will result in doughy, non-crispy tempura. Keep the tempura batter in the refrigerator while you prepare the foods for frying.  Preparing the dipping ingredients Prepare the foods for frying in the tempura batter ahead of time. If you are making fish tempura, wash and debone the fish, then cut the fish into small chunks. If you are using shrimp in your tempura, the shrimp should be de-veined. Use the freshest, firmest vegetables you can find to make vegetable tempura. Wash the vegetables thoroughly. Cut the vegetables into chunks. Avoid soft vegetables, as soft vegetables will become soggy when the vegetables are deep-fried. Pat the food dry with paper towels. Place the food in the refrigerator until you're ready to deep fry. Frying Set the bowl of homemade tempura batter in a larger bowl filled with ice water. Tempura batter should be kept cold while you work. Season the cut veggies.
