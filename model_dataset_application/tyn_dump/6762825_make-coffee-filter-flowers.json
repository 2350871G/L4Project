Food coloring in particular can stain your hands and clothes, so be prepared to get a little dirty! You'll need a small actual work area (enough room for a bowl), but more importantly, you'll need enough room to let your filters air dry. If you're planning on making a lot of flowers, lay out some newspaper or wax paper, or a set of trays or cutting boards, enough to accommodate several stacks of coffee filters, side by side."

Aim for somewhere between the quantity of toothpaste you'd put on a toothbrush and the amount of cream cheese you'd put on a bagel. There's no real science to it; just add a little at a time, stirring and mixing as you go, until your color is evenly distributed in the water. To get an idea of how dark or vibrant the color will actually be on the filter, you just have to try it out. Then you can add more water or more color to change the outcome, as desired."

          "description":"You can dye several filters at a time without any negative effect, so grab somewhere between five and ten in a stack, fold the whole stack in quarters (just for ease of handling), and stick the outer edge in the water. There's no need to immerse them completely, because the filters are very absorbent; they'll suck up the color. Try experimenting with how much dye you apply to each one. You might want some of the filters to just have dyed edges or be half colored, and others to be fully colored. Similarly, you might want to do some with a mixture that has a lot of color in it, and others with a more watered-down variation. Dye filters in various shades. Flowers with slightly darker centers or outer edges can look pretty neat!"

This might take longer than you think; ideally, leave them overnight. Make sure they're on some newspaper, wax paper, or another surface you don't mind getting stained. If you really want to accelerate the process, you can try using a hair dryer to dry them out; it does work, but it can also cause the paper to curl up and change a little in texture, so keep an eye out for any unintended consequences if you try this."

In other words, don't cut too much off; just enough to create a neat edge. There's lots of room for experimentation here; try some filters with deeper or shallower curves, some with more or fewer petals, etc. If you're not sure where to begin, start with three to four curves on each quarter side of filter, about half an inch in height."

Once you have the center of all six filters held tight, secure the pinched bottom with a stapler. Don't worry about manhandling the filters. Even if they get folded or crushed, the outcome will still look good; in fact, you're going to end up purposefully fluffing and crushing them, later. Optional alternative: An alternative approach here can result in a more secure flower. This won't work well with pipe cleaners, but if you have a fairly thin wire (like 18-gauge floral wire) for your stems, you can actually poke each filter through it, at the center. Hold the wire firmly and start with the big ones, pushing the wire through each one's center, one by one; then do the small ones. Once all the filters are skewered, use pliers to create a little twist in the wire at the top, like the flower bud's \"core\".

Lay the stem against the pinched bottom of the flower and staple it to the filters. This can get a little finicky if you don't have a good stapler, but it is doable.

Cutting the \"Petals\" Start with three coffee filters - the flower's outside layers. Stack them and fold the whole stack into quarters (fold them in half, and then in half again). Cut out a ruffled or scalloped edge. This will help the final craft look more like a flower. The edge you're cutting shouldn't be too far from the filter's original edge (assuming you want a flower that's about the size of the original filters). In other words, don't cut too much off; just enough to create a neat edge. There's lots of room for experimentation here; try some filters with deeper or shallower curves, some with more or fewer petals, etc. If you're not sure where to begin, start with three to four curves on each quarter side of filter, about half an inch in height. Grab three more coffee filters for your flower's center. Stack them and again, fold the whole stack into quarters. Cut a slightly lower scalloped edge.

Try to keep your \"petal\" size and shape - that is, your scalloped edge - fairly similar to what you cut the first time, for consistency. You want this stack of filters to be a little smaller than the first one, but generally similar in design. Assembling Your Flowers Open up and stack all six filters. You don't need them folded anymore; open them up and smooth them out, before stacking them. The smaller set go on top, the larger underneath. You might want to separate and rotate the individual filters a little, so that the petals don't perfectly align. Pinch the filters at the center point, and work your stack into a cone or flower shape. This part can be tricky the first time, but you'll get used to it. Don't worry about getting the \"petals\" looking perfect at this stage; you just need to secure the center of the flowers.
