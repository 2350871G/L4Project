  "text":" Preparing the Chair for Cleaning Cover your floor. Before beginning the cleaning process, protect the area where you will be cleaning. Lay out a plastic sheet underneath your rolling desk chair. Flip your chair upside down. It\u2019s easier to work with the wheels of your chair when they are elevated and fully exposed. Remove the wheels. Most rolling desk chair wheels can be removed by simply pulling on them. However, some models require a screwdriver or wrench in order to remove the wheels. If the wheels of your chair cannot be removed, remove the base or legs of the chair from the upper seat portion. Cleaning the Inside of the Wheels Use your fingers to remove visible debris. Remove any small objects, stickers or larger pieces of debris that can easily be removed by hand. Use tools to help remove stuck debris. If any debris seems stuck, grab a pair of tweezers to remove it. Other tools to help remove debris include scissors, nail clippers, bottle cutters and screwdrivers. Use duct tape to remove small pieces of debris. Cut a strip of duct tape so that it can fit inside the wheel.

Vacuum the wheels. Use a vacuum to capture any small pieces of dirt or debris that could not be picked up with tape. Ensure you are using a smaller vacuum attachment for easier access. Cleaning the Outside of the Wheels Use a scrub brush to remove debris. Scrub the outside of the wheel with a strong scrub brush. You may want to lightly soak the brush in soapy water.
