The motor rests on top of springs and is attached to a flat base that guides the motor down at a 90 degree angle. The motor rises back into position when downward pressure is released, raising the router bit above the base. Attached to a collet, the motor connects much like a hand drill chuck. It comes in 2 sizes, 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch (as well as 8 mm and 12 mm in metric sizes). This is where the router bit does the cutting."
