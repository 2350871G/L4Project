Fill a bowl with cool water and let the leaves soak for about ten minutes, then remove them. If the water appears dirty, pour it down the drain and refill the bowl to repeat the process until the water comes away clean. Rinse the leaves off and lay them on a clean paper towel. Dry the leaves with a salad spinner. Place the leaves inside the spinner\u2019s strainer basket and put the lid on securely. Run the spinner for 15-20 seconds to remove excess water.

Toss it gently, but don\u2019t put the dressing on the salad, as this will make the leaves limp. Wait to add dressing until right before you eat the salad. Store any dressing in a separate container in the refrigerator. Adding it too soon will make the leaves limp and soggy. Place a clean, dry paper towel on top of the bowl.
