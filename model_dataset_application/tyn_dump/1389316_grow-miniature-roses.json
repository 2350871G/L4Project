    "Once your rose bush has grown to full size, begin pruning it in the fall.",
    "Cut the branches at a 45-degree angle about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) above outward-facing bud eyes.",
    "The amount you trim will depend on the number of bud eyes on your plant, but you should trim about 1/2 to 2/3 of the plant.",
    "This helps conserve nutrients as the temperatures start to get cold.",
    "The bud eyes are the knobs on the stem that produce flowers.",
    "Cover your roses with mulch in the winter if growing them outdoors.",
    "To put your roses into dormancy over the winter, cover them in a layer of mulch about 2 in (5.1 cm) thick.",
    "Cover the whole bush with mulch to protect your plants from the elements.",
    "Use your shovel to help you spread the mulch.",
    "Cover the plants with mulch 1-3 frosts before the temperatures stay at freezing.",
    "If your roses are in containers, bring them inside and place them in a sunny spot by the window.",
    "To bring them back in the spring, remove the mulch, water the roots, and provide compost or fertilizer on top."
