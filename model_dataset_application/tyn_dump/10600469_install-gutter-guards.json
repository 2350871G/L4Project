    "Products made of plastic are easier to cut, so you\u2019ll probably only need a utility knife or box cutter.",
    "Mounting Screw-Fastened Guards Install support brackets, if necessary.",
    "Some surface-tension covers are secured with brackets, which are screwed into place along the roofline.",
    "If your guard system includes brackets, mount them with 3 in (7.6 cm) self-tapping roofing screws.",
    "Check the installation guide and space the brackets along the roofline as directed.",
    "To maintain a watertight seal, apply a small amount of roofing cement around the screws that secure the brackets to the roof.",
    "Brackets are more common in top-quality gutter guard systems, which are often professionally installed.",
    "Slide the back edge of the guard under the shingles.",
    "Carefully loosen the bottom edges of the first row of shingles.",
    "Then slide the inside edge of the first guard section beneath the shingles.",
    "Take care not to loosen the underlayment, or the waterproof layer, beneath the shingles.",
    "Slide the guard section into place between the shingle layer and the underlayment, not between the underlayment and the roof deck.",
    "Mount the guard to the gutter lip with self-tapping metal screws.",
    "If your guard system didn\u2019t come with screws, use 2 in (5.1 cm) self-tapping sheet metal screws, or go with the length specified in the installation guide.",
    "Align the first section\u2019s pre-drilled holes with the top of the gutter\u2019s lip, then drive the screws into the gutter with a cordless power drill.",
    "Self-tapping screws are designed drill their own hole, so pre-drilling holes into the gutter\u2019s lip is unnecessary.Variation: If your guard system uses brackets, mount your guard sections onto the brackets according to the installation guide.",
    "Cut miter joints where sections meet at corners.",
    "If you\u2019re installing surface-tension guards, 2 adjoining sections that meet at a corner will need miter cuts.",
    "Use a miter box or protractor to measure a 45-degree angle at the end of a section, mark your line, then cut the edge with tin snips or a utility knife.",
    "Cut a corresponding angle in the section that will join with the first.",
    "Double check that you\u2019ve aligned the 2 sections correctly before cutting.",
    "When lined up with each other, the 45-degree slants in each section should meet flush so the 2 sections form a 90-degree corner, or a right angle.",
    "Make sure the inner and outer sides of each section face the right direction.",
    "Seal the screws with roofing cement.",
    "After you\u2019ve installed a guard section, dab a small amount of roofing cement over the screw holes.",
    "If you\u2019re installing mesh guards, take care not to clog any openings with cement.",
    "Sealing the screws helps ensure water will flow into the gutter instead of running through the holes in the lip.",
    "Trim excess lengths of guard with tin snips or a utility knife.",
    "Repeat the steps to install sections until you\u2019ve reached the end of the gutter run.",
    "Then measure the remaining distance between the last full section and the end of the gutter.",
    "If necessary, use a pair of tin snips or a utility knife to cut a guard section to match the remaining length of gutter.",
    "Choosing a Gutter Guard System Measure your gutters\u2019 height, width, and length.",
    "As with any other home project, measure twice and cut once.",
    "That way, you\u2019ll know the size and amount of guard material you\u2019ll need.",
    "Additionally, knowing the total length you\u2019ll need will help you set your budget and compare prices.",
    "As insurance, plan on purchasing about 10% more guard material than your gutters\u2019 total length.Tip: When you measure your gutters, see which type of debris it collects.",
    "Large leaves and twigs are pretty easy to manage, but flower buds, evergreen needles, and seeds can slip through coarse-mesh gutter screens.",
    "Go with mesh guards for an easy, affordable option.",
    "Mesh and grated guards are easy to install and typically cost between $1 and $3 (U.S.) per foot (30.5 cm).",
    "On the downside, they\u2019re usually not quite as effective as surface-tension gutter covers.",
    "Still, they\u2019re the way to go if you want an easier, less expensive product that doesn\u2019t make a big visual impact.",
    "Mesh and grate guards made of lightweight plastic are the cheapest option, but they're easily damaged or dislodged.",
    "Metal and heavy-duty plastic products are more durable.",
    "Inexpensive coarse-mesh screens are good options for keeping out large leaves and twigs.",
    "However, since debris tends to get stuck in coarse-mesh screens, they\u2019re generally harder to clean.",
    "A fine-mesh guard is more effective for needles, seeds, and other small debris.",
    "That said, large leaves and twigs can sometimes collect on top of fine-mesh products, so you may need to sweep or hose down the guards from time to time.",
    "Choose surface-tension hoods for the most durable option.",
    "Surface-tension covers curve over a gutter, allow water to drip inside, and block debris from entering.",
    "They typically last longer, stand up better to the elements, and generally require less maintenance than screens and grates.",
    "Cost and complexity are the major drawbacks.",
    "At $6 to $10 (U.S.) per foot (30.5 cm), they\u2019re expensive.",
    "Some models must be professionally installed, which can push the cost per foot (30.5 cm) up to $15 to $20.",
    "If your gutters\u2019 pitch is too steep, they may need to be rehung or the opening between them and the cover will be too wide.",
    "In addition, if you want an inconspicuous option, most gutter covers are bulkier and more obvious than screens.",
    "If you\u2019re budget-conscious and don\u2019t want to hire a professional, consider PVC surface-tension covers.",
    "They\u2019re not as durable as metal covers, but they\u2019re cheaper and easier to carry up a ladder.",
    "Purchase snap-on guards if convenience is your priority.",
    "Both surface-tension covers and mesh screens come in snap-on and screw-fastened varieties.",
    "Regardless of the gutter guard system you choose, you\u2019ll need to remove the guards and clean your gutters periodically.",
    "If convenience is a priority and you're less worried about weather damage, go with a snap-on option.",
    "There are also screen guards that are simply wedged into a gutter.",
    "They cost as little as $0.10 per foot (30.5 cm), but they\u2019re ineffective.",
    "With no fasteners at all, they don\u2019t keep out debris, and they easily become dislodged.",
    "Look for screw-fastened guards if you live in a windy or stormy area.",
    "Snap-ons are easier to install and remove, but they\u2019re more susceptible to strong winds, heavy rain, falling branches and snow.",
    "For the sturdiest option, go for guards that are fastened to the gutter with screws.",
    "Screw-fastened products require more work and are usually a bit more expensive than snap-on versions.",
    "Steer clear of foam inserts and brushes.",
    "Other designs on the market include foam and brush strips that are inserted into the gutter.",
    "These guards are inexpensive and easy to use, but they\u2019re not very effective and need to be cleaned out frequently.",
    "Leaves and other debris can get caught in brush fibers.",
    "Foam tends to collect seeds, which can sprout and grow without regular maintenance.",
    "Unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary, avoid inserts and screens without fasteners.",
    "You\u2019re investing time and money, not to mention going through the hassle of climbing up a ladder, so you want to make sure your product does its job."
