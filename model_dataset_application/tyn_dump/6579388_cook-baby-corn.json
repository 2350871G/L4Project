    "Add the baby corn to the hot oil.",
    "Cook, stirring continuously, until the corn becomes tender and light golden brown on all sides.",
    "When bitten or pierced with a fork, the baby corn should feel tender but should still retain some \u201cbite\u201d or crispness.",
    "Serve.",
    "Drain the oil and serve the baby corn while it's still hot.",
    "The cooking oil should added flavor to the corn, so you probably won't need to add any butter.",
    "You could, however, serve the corn with a sprinkle of fresh herbs or a dash of pepper.",
    "Save leftovers in an airtight container and store them in your refrigerator for up to one or two days.",
    "Deep Frying Preheat the oil.",
    "Pour 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) of vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed saucepan.",
    "Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat, and heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).",
    "Use a frying thermometer to check the temperature of the oil.",
    "If the oil isn't hot enough, the batter could get soggy before the corn finishes cooking.",
    "If the oil is too hot, the batter could burn before the corn is adequately cooked.",
    "Mix the batter.",
    "Meanwhile, combine the all-purpose flour, corn starch, chili powder, garlic powder, and salt.",
    "Add enough water to this mixture to form a thin, paste-like batter.",
    "This is a very basic batter, but you can vary the spices as desired to produce a stronger or milder flavor.",
    "Drench the baby corn in batter.",
    "Working in batches, dip the cobs of baby corn into the batter.",
    "Use a fork to turn each baby corn, coating all sides.",
    "Fry the baby corn for 2 to 4 minutes.",
    "Toss several coated cobs of baby corn into the hot oil.",
    "Fry the corn until both sides are golden brown, flipping them once halfway through the process.",
    "Continue working in batches to avoid crowding the pan.",
    "The temperature of the oil will drop slightly when you add the corn to it, and adding too much at once can drop the temperature too severely, thereby inhibiting the cooking process.",
    "Drain and serve.",
    "Use a slotted spoon to transfer the baby corn from the hot oil to a plate lined with paper towels.",
    "Wait several minutes, then enjoy the corn while it's still hot.",
    "Deep fried baby corn is difficult to save and will likely become soggy if you attempt to reheat it after refrigeration.",
    "If necessary, however, you could refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to one day.",
    "Braising Combine the broth and seasonings over heat.",
    "Pour the chicken/vegetable broth into a medium frying pan.",
    "Stir in the soy sauce, salt, and pepper, then bring the seasoned broth to a simmer over medium-high heat.",
    "Cook the baby corn for 3 to 6 minutes.",
    "Place the baby corn in the seasoned broth.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan, then cook the corn until it becomes tender-crisp.",
    "Consider turning the corn once halfway through the cooking process.",
    "Doing so can help distribute the flavors of the broth more evenly.",
    "Do not cook the corn beyond the tender-crisp stage.",
    "It should feel soft when pierced with a fork or bitten into, but it should still retain some \u201cbite\u201d or crispness.",
    "Serve.",
    "Remove the baby corn from any remaining broth and serve it while it's still warm.",
    "Store leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to one or two days.",
    "Roasting Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).",
    "Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.",
    "Toss the baby corn in oil.",
    "Arrange the baby corn on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle the cobs with sesame oil.",
    "Toss gently, using a fork, to coat the corn evenly.",
    "If desired, you could also sprinkle the coated baby corn cobs with a little salt for an additional boost of flavor.",
    "Roast the corn for 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "Place the baby corn in the preheated oven and cook it until they become tender and light golden brown.",
    "To promote even browning, stir and flip the baby corn cobs halfway through the baking process.",
    "Ideally, the baby corn should be tender-crisp when you remove it from the oven.",
    "If you roast it too long, it can become unpleasantly soggy.",
    "Serve.",
    "Remove the finished corn from the oven and serve it while it's still warm.",
    "Save leftovers in your refrigerator, keeping them inside an airtight container.",
    "Use within one or two days.",
    "Microwaving Place the baby corn in a microwave-safe dish.",
    "Arrange the baby corn in a single layer inside a shallow, microwave-safe dish.",
    "Pour the water over the corn.",
    "Loosely cover the dish with its lid or with a sheet of microwave-safe plastic wrap.",
    "Microwave for 2 to 7 minutes.",
    "Cook the baby corn on high power until it becomes tender-crisp.",
    "The exact cooking time will vary depending on the type and size of the baby corn.",
    "Canned baby corn has already been pre-cooked, so it should be done within 2 minutes.",
    "Smaller portions of frozen or fresh baby corn may require 3 or 4 minutes, while larger portions might need the full 7 minutes.",
    "Check the corn at 1 to 2 minute intervals to avoid cooking it past the tender-crisp stage.",
    "Serve.",
    "Drain the cooking water and serve the baby corn while it's still hot.",
    "You can serve the baby corn with melted butter, if desired.",
    "Store leftovers in an airtight container.",
    "Refrigerate for up to one or two days."
