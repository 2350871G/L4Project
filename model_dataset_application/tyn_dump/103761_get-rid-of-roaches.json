          "description":"Cockroach bait is either housed in a childproof-case or applied as a gel and contains a slow-working poison mixed in with an attractive food (for cockroaches). The roaches eat the poison and bring it back to the nest, where it eventually kills all the other roaches. Place the bait in an area where you know cockroaches will encounter it, such as along baseboards, under the sink, and in corners. It should be as close to the nest as possible, so that as many roaches as possible will eat it and take it back to the nest. Most cockroach baits contain Fipronil .05% or Hydramethylnon 2% as the active ingredient. Roaches will eat the poison, then excrete it back at the nest, where other roaches will come into contact with it and die. Killing roaches using this method can take several weeks. Once the first generation of cockroaches is killed, their eggs will hatch, and more cockroaches will have to be poisoned before the nest is gone for good."

The sugar and flour attracts the roaches, and the boric acid kills them. Sprinkle the powder in the backs of drawers and cabinets, under the refrigerator, under the stove, and so on. You can also try a similar mixture of 1-part boric acid, 2 parts flour and 1 part cocoa. Expect at least 3 cycles of disappearance/reemergence of progressively smaller hordes of cockroaches, lasting about 2 weeks each. Continue using boric acid till roaches are gone. Kids, dogs, and some other pets will eat this mixture. Boric acid is not highly toxic to humans and pets, but is for external use only, so place it where only the bugs can get it. The mixture will cake hard in humid environments, so paper or foil trays may be needed to protect your floors and cabinets."

You can splash it, spray it or just throw it on the roach. Just 2 or 3 drops of a soapy water solution can kill a roach. Ensure that it makes contact with the roach's head and lower abdomen. If you can turn the roach over, hitting the belly is best. The roach will run or try to run, but will suddenly stop and die or be almost dead in one minute. The soapy water kills them by forming a thin film over the roach's breathing pores that stays in place due to surface tension, causing the roach to suffocate. Throw the roach away as soon as possible, since it could recover if the water dries up or has not touched a large percentage of its body."

The spray may contaminate the bait and cause roaches to stay away from it. Using spray against roaches works to keep them out of sight for the present moment, but it can also serve to drive them further into your walls and make the problem worse.

    "Tape it into place around the rim.",
    "Pour a bit of water with soap in the bottom of the bottle, and set the trap in a place where roaches hang out.",
    "They'll craw into the trap and drown.",
    "Preventing Reinfestation Move yard debris away from the outside of the house.",
    "Cockroaches love piles of wood and other convenient hiding places, and as the weather turns colder, they'll migrate inside the house to keep warm.",
    "Make sure your woodpile is far away from the house.",
    "Remove piles of straw, leaves, clippings, and any other yard waste.",
    "Seal the house to keep roaches from entering.",
    "Seal cracks in exterior walls to keep roaches out of the house by blocking their entrance.",
    "Seal cracks everywhere you can inside your house as well.",
    "This takes time, but the payoff is great, because you eliminate most of their favorite hiding and breeding places.",
    "Fill every crack inside every cabinet in your kitchen.",
    "Fill the cracks on both sides of floor, door, and window moldings.",
    "Fill all openings around pipes in bathrooms and kitchens.",
    "Set out preventative traps.",
    "Even if you successfully got rid of a nest, prevent a re-infestation by setting out traps that will kill roaches before they get out of control.",
    "The best approach is to leave the caulk off a few cracks that are close to potential areas of entry, like the drain or vents, and place traps as follows:\nSpray over with insecticide (such as Raid) in either gel or liquid form.",
    "This serves as a second line of defense should any roaches survive or get past the physical barriers; this will at the very least weaken them.",
    "Alternatively sprinkle salt under kitchen cabinets and in cracks.",
    "If the place is vacant for an extended period, mop tiled floors with salty water before leaving.",
    "Fix any openings with caulk, Spackle or some other hardening mixture.",
    "If the crack is on a baseboard or wood, after putting the Spackle down, rub with resin or cover with wood paint.",
    "Once the Spackle has hardened, 4-6 hours after its application, it is child-safe."
