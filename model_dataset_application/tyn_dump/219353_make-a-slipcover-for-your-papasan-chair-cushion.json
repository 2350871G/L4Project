  "text":" Acquire about 4 yards (3.5 meters) of fairly heavy fabric. Twill, denim and some of the heavier decorator fabrics work well. Launder your fabric and press it smooth if necessary.  Lay your fabric out flat on the floor and place your cushion on top of it.

Fold your cut circle in half and lay the center fold approximately 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the aligned selvage edges; 3 inches (7.6 cm) for non-selvage edges. Smooth any wrinkles.

Clip the corners of your folded circle to mark the diameter line at the edge of the circle.  Roll the straight edges of the half circles and hem them at 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).
