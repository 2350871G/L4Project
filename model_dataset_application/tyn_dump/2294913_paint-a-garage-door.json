Try to schedule your project for a stretch that\u2019s not too hot, cold or humid. Be particularly wary of precipitation, as excess moisture can easily undo all of your hard work. The next couple of days after you paint should also be clear in order to give new paint a chance to set properly.

A filthy garage door will be harder to paint, and may result in a sloppy, uneven finish. Though some professionals swear by certain specialty cleaning products, the best way to do this is simply to use a sponge or cloth soaked in soapy water. Rinse the door with a hose and blot it dry with a clean towel prior to painting. Never apply fresh paint to a wet surface."

A dropcloth or plastic tarp will help prevent stains from dripping or splattering paint. It will also be useful for catching dirt and other debris that\u2019s loosened from the door. If you don\u2019t have a dropcloth or tarp, an old blanket or a few sheets of overlapping newspaper will also do the trick."

This can save you a lot of scouring and scraping later on should your painting project get a little messy. Line up the tape with care and accuracy. Otherwise, you could end up with uneven edges.

For most garage doors, lighter shades like white, beige or pearl will work best because they won\u2019t fade as much in the sunlight. In general, it\u2019s a good idea to match the color of the garage door to the color of the house itself. A contrasting trim color will create the look of depth around the door.

You\u2019ll only need to use one thin coat of primer. Make sure the primer is dry to the touch before you attempt to paint over it. Those who are planning on touching up their garage doors in the same shade can dispense with a separate coat of primer. It may be helpful, however, to purchase a paint that includes a built-in primer to ensure the color comes out the way it\u2019s supposed to. Allow the primer to dry for at least 12 hours."

The narrow width and manual control offered by the brush will enable you to penetrate deeper into crevices and molded depressions. Work slowly and carefully, painting each of the inner panels one by one. Look over the door to make sure you haven\u2019t missed any thin or bare spots. Depending on the color and general condition of your garage door, you may need to use multiple coats to achieve a solid finish."

Painting with a roller is quick and painless compared to manual brushing. A roller also guarantees a consistent finish, and won\u2019t leave behind any visible strokes or seams. Paint with long, steady motions, overlapping the rough edges of each stripe. For most basic paint jobs, a single coat of paint will usually be enough. If you're switching to a bolder shade or painting a lighter color over a darker one, it may be necessary to use multiple coats in order to get the color to show up. Let each coat dry for roughly 12 hours before applying additional coats. Set the door\u2019s action to manual and raise or lower it as needed to paint a specific area. This will prevent the discomfort of being forced to crouch, stoop and stand repeatedly."

During this time, it\u2019s best to leave the door in a closed (down) position so that it can receive plenty of airflow. Resist the urge to touch the drying paint, and keep cars, bicycles, tools and toys at a safe distance. Though the paint will usually harden to the touch in a matter of hours, it may take as long as a week for it to completely cure. It may be necessary to park your car outside while the garage door is drying."
