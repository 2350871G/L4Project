Then walk outside to your physical air conditioner and look at the side of your house to find the power box. Pull out the safety plug from the box and leave it out until you\u2019re done cleaning the coils. Taking these precautions is essential to keeping you safe from electrical shocks! For extra safety, turn off the breaker that powers the air conditioning unit, too. The breaker will either be on the side of your house, in the basement, or in a utility closet."

If you\u2019re working in the fall and haven\u2019t been using your air conditioning unit recently, you can skip this step. Take a few minutes to clear away any branches, leaves, or weeds that are growing around the unit. Avoid using high pressure on the unit, as that could damage the coils. A gentle spray for 1 to 2 minutes should be sufficient to cool them down."

Place the nozzle about 4 inches (10 cm) away from the coils, and spray the foam onto the unit. Start at the top and work your way to the bottom until the entire coil is covered. Repeat this on every side of the HVAC unit. The coils usually have a filter or grate covering them, which is what you\u2019ll be spraying and cleaning. The coils themselves are usually bronze or silver and they snake back and forth from the top of the unit to its bottom. You\u2019ll need 2 to 3 cans to clean your entire HVAC unit.

The coils of your HVAC unit are constantly drawing in air, so they\u2019re covered with dirt and dust. Cleaning them once a year helps keep your unit running efficiently.
