Reducing the milk to 3/4 its original volume will take about 45 minutes. Reducing the milk in this way will give it an incredible nutty, caramelized flavor that is missing from the \"instant\" version of kulfi. The resulting condensed milk should come to roughly 2 cups. Reducing by 3/4 is the minimum, but to get the best flavor, you may want to reduce the milk to 2/3 or even 1/3 its original volume. This gives you the most authentic, flavorful kulfi, but also requires you to stir regularly for 4 hours or more."

If you can't find them, try substituting with disposable souffle cups or even popsicle molds. Don't fill them to the top--remember that liquid expands when it is frozen. Greasing your kulfi molds may help you release the ice cream when it's time to serve. If you want garnish on your kulfi, like bits of pistachio stuck to the outside, sprinkle a little into the mold before pouring in the mixture.
