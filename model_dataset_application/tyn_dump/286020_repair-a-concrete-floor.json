For added comfort, wear knee pads. These will prevent pain and bruising when you kneel down on the concrete. If you don\u2019t have knee pads, you can also lay a padded mat in your work area."

If you make a mistake and chisel off too much, don\u2019t worry. You can patch those holes the same way you\u2019re patching the main crack. Don\u2019t chisel just for the sake of it.

Pass over the area several times and ensure you\u2019ve picked up all the debris. If you don\u2019t have a shop vac, don\u2019t use a normal vacuum cleaner. Concrete shards could damage it.

If the mortar is too watery, it won\u2019t bond well. Add more dry mortar to make it thicker if you have to. The amount you use depends on the size of the hole you have to fill.
