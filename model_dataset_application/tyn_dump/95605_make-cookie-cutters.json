          "description":"Pour out any remaining liquid, and then use a bottle cleaner to scrub the inside of the can with soap and hot water. Place the can with the opening facing down to dry for at least 2-3 hours before starting to make your cookie cutters. If you don\u2019t have a bottle cleaner, you can roll up a paper towel to clean the inside of the can. However, be careful around the opening, since the edges can be sharp."

          "headline":"Cut off the top and bottom of the soda can with sharp scissors.",
          "description":"Push one of the blades of the scissors into the can about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) away from the lip on the top of the can, and then cut around the can to remove the top. Then, do the same with the bottom of the can so you have an aluminum cylinder that\u2019s open on the top and the bottom. If your scissors aren\u2019t sharp enough to cut into the can, try using a box cutter to puncture the metal, and then finish cutting with the scissors. If you don\u2019t have an empty soda can available, you can cut out the bottom sheet of an oven liner with a pair of sharp scissors.Warning: The edges of the can will be extremely sharp once you begin cutting them. It\u2019s best to wear a pair of thick rubber gloves or work gloves while you\u2019re cutting and handling the metal."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use the scissors to cut strips out of the remaining can.",
          "description":"Cut straight down the side of the cylinder so that the aluminum can lay flat on a table, like a sheet. Then, carefully cut strips of at least \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) in width from the can. It may be helpful to use a marker to draw guidelines for the strips, or you can make the cuts freehand. For larger cookies, cut horizontally across the aluminum sheet that you made so that the strips are as long as possible. For smaller cookie cutters, cut the strips vertically so they\u2019re shorter."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bend the strips into the shapes that you like.",
          "description":"Carefully take the strips in your hands and form them into the shape that you want. Remember, they don\u2019t have to be perfect since you\u2019ll be able to bend them slightly as needed if they\u2019re not producing the results that you want. If you have a more complicated shape, like a mustache, try tracing the shape onto a piece of cardboard. Then, cut the shape out of the cardboard, and bend the aluminum around the perimeter to form the cookie cutter. For some simple shapes you can make, try wrapping the strips around a cup to make a circle. You can bend different parts of the circle to make a heart or cloud shape. You can also easily make a triangle, square, or a  crescent moon."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Glue the ends of the cookie cutter together with food-grade glue.",
          "description":"When the shape is ready, trim off any excess aluminum and hold the two ends of the strip together. Seal them with a food-safe adhesive, like Permabond or Hot Melt, and let the adhesive dry for at least 6 hours before using the cookie cutters. If you don\u2019t have food-safe adhesive, you can use regular tape to attach the edges. If you use tape, the cookie cutters will be more delicate, so be careful when you use them! Once you use the cookie cutters, you can hand-wash them with soap and water to reuse them. Be sure to let them dry completely before storing them to prevent rust."

Once the image prints, let the ink dry for 2-3 minutes before handling the paper.

If you\u2019re having trouble because the shape is complex, try working in small sections at a time to make sure you make the shape as accurate as possible.

If you\u2019re planning on baking the cookies immediately, place the dough on top of a sheet of parchment paper on the cookie sheet to prevent them from sticking to the metal.Tip: If you just made the dough, store it in the fridge or freezer while you make the stencil so that it\u2019s chilled when you\u2019re ready to cut out the shapes."

If you have interior cutouts, use a knife or your fingers to gently pull them out of the shape. Reposition the cookies on the sheet as needed before baking. Remember, you can reuse the dough that you pulled off of the sheet. Simply form it into a ball and roll it out again to form a smaller sheet of dough. Once you\u2019ve cut out all of your cookies, you can throw your cookie cutter away. Since it\u2019s made of paper and can\u2019t be cleaned, you shouldn\u2019t reuse it."
