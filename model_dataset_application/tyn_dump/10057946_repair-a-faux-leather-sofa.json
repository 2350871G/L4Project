Next, use a fine-grit sanding sponge to smooth down any rough edges and bubbles. Don't get too carried away here! You only need to peel away the coating that's within the damaged area."

This could take a few hours, depending on the type of paint that you are using. Bring 1 of the sofa cushions to the store so that they can color-match the paint for you.

Be sure to round the corners of the rectangle or square to help prevent buckling. This will go behind the tear and \u201cleather,\u201d so the color of the fabric does not matter.

    "Apply the paint over the tear with a sponge brush, then dry it with a hair dryer.",
    "Again, this step is for aesthetic purposes.",
    "If you just want to patch up the tear, then you don\u2019t need to do this.",
    "If you texturized the tear with super glue, then you should apply the paint to help blend it in.",
    "Take one of the sofa pillows to the store with you so that you can match the color of the paint to it.",
    "Blend the tear in further with sanding and more glue, if needed.",
    "Take a look at your repair.",
    "The tear looks seamless, then you are good to go.",
    "If you see some bumps and ridges, sand the surface down with 220- to 325-grit sandpaper, then apply more super glue.",
    "Pat the glue with a paper towel, apply more paint, then heat-set the paint with a hairdryer.",
    "Be careful with bonded leather, which is just a thin layer of paint on a fabric-like backing.",
    "If you sand outside the painted area, you risk damaging the surface."
