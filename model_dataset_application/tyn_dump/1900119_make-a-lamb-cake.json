Use a piping bag to build small peaks aligned regularly across the lamb's body to look like wool. Or make long waves of piped icing. See the images for more ideas. A brown (chocolate) version). Decorate with melted white chocolate. Use your favorite melted white chocolate recipe and pour over the lamb cake. Allow to set and attach decorations using new melted chocolate dabbed on the back of the decorative items. Decorate with marshmallows. Ice as normal but stick marshmallows in a neat pattern across the areas of the lamb where there would be wool. Decorate with coconut. Ice as normal with white icing/frosting and sprinkle desiccated or shredded coconut across the lamb's body. Use piped whipped cream for the wool. Use chocolate curls. Make small chocolate curls from white chocolate. Frost or ice the lamb and attach the white chocolate curls evenly across the lamb's body and head to form wool. Or, if you're feeling inclined toward a more out-there cake, you could skip frosting or icing and just make a zombie lamb cake. Use a red velvet cake mix for this lamb cake."
