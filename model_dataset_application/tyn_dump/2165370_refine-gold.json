  "text":" Melt the Gold Place your gold jewelry, gold powder or nugget inside of a crucible. Most crucibles are made of graphite, which enables them to withstand the melting of the material inside. Place the crucible on a fireproof surface.  Aim an acetylene torch at the gold. Aim the flame at the gold until the gold is completely melted. Pick up the crucible using crucible tongs.  Separate the gold into small pieces and allow them to harden. This is called \u201cmaking shot.\u201d If you are refining small pieces of jewelry like rings, then you can simply melt the piece without making shot particles. Add the Acid Choose the appropriate container. For every ounce of gold that you want to refine, you will need 300 milliliters in container capacity. Use containers large heavy-gauge plastic buckets or Pyrex Vision Ware pots. Wear protective gear. Put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands from the acid. Wear the gloves as you handle any of the chemicals mentioned in this article. Wear a rubber apron to protect your clothing. Wear goggles to protect your eyes. Consider wearing a face mask to prevent the inhalation of noxious fumes. Place the container outdoors in a well-ventilated area. The acid reactions in the aqua regia process produce strong and noxious fumes that are extremely dangerous. Pour 30 milliliters of nitric acid for every ounce of gold into your container. Allow the acid to react with the gold for 30 minutes. Add 120 milliliters of hydrochloric acid or muriatic acid for every ounce of gold in the container. Allow the solution to sit overnight until all of the acid fumes have been dispelled. Pour the acid into another larger container.

Pour the acid into a clean container as soon as the acid is clear of dissolved gold particles. The acid should be amber with what looks like mud collected at the bottom of the container. Do not pour the mud off with the acid. The mud is pure gold. Cleaning the Gold Add tap water to the mud remaining in your container. Stir the water and allow the mud to settle. Pour the water into the container into which you poured the acid.  Rinse the gold mud again 3 to 4 times with water and pour off the excess water.  Rinse the gold with aqua ammonia. You will see white vapors come off of the gold mud. Make sure to protect your eyes and to avoid inhaling the fumes. Rinse the ammonia from the mud with distilled water.  Pour the mud into a large beaker. Pour off all of the distilled water so that only mud remains. Reconstituting the Gold Place your beaker onto a hot plate.
