In addition to the bed itself, bed bugs can often be found in places like carpeting, curtain folds, electrical outlets, and furniture joints. Work your way around the room slowly, exploring each of these potential hot spots in depth. Bed bugs are typically around 5\u20137 millimetres (0.20\u20130.28 in) long, with oval-shaped bodies and a reddish-brown hue. Younger pests may be lighter in color or even translucent if they haven't fed recently. While they are visible to the naked eye, bed bugs are exceptionally tiny, so you'll need to look closely in order to spot them. A flashlight may come in handy in dimly-lit areas. Even if you don't catch a glimpse of the bugs themselves, the presence of skin castings, droppings, and rust-colored stains will confirm that they've found their way into your home."

You'll be using the concentrated heat it generates to drive the bed bugs out of the hard-to-reach places where they've set themselves up. Bed bugs are sensitive to heat, so the more intense the temperature you expose them to, the better. Switch the hair dryer to a low heat setting instead if you're going to be using it around plastics or other materials that might melt or warp."

If there are indeed bed bugs lurking inside, you should notice them making a run for it within a few seconds. If you don't detect any signs of activity after about a minute, move on to another possible location and try again. The hair dryer method will be most effective for forcing bed bugs out of spots where they'd be difficult or impossible to see, such as small cracks, electrical fixtures, pipes, and other openings.Tip: The heat from a hair dryer can actually kill bed bugs if it's held on them steadily for around 30 seconds."

It may help to use the tip of one finger to create enough pressure to flatten the tiny invaders in their tracks. If for some reason you're not able to flush the paper right away, take it outside and dispose of it in a sealed trash receptacle a safe distance from your home. Remember that paper towels shouldn't be flushed down the toilet, as this can put unnecessary strain on your plumbing or septic system."
