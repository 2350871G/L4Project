Make sure there aren\u2019t any clumps of cake mix left. For an alternative to vegetable oil, melt 1/2 cup (115 g) of butter. You can also substitute a different type of oil, like olive or canola oil. If you want a lower fat option, use \u20442 cup (120 ml) of applesauce instead of the oil. How to Choose a Cake Mix\nIf you want cookies that taste like birthday cake, go with a funfetti or vanilla mix. If you love chocolate, use devil\u2019s food or dark chocolate cake mix. If you want something a little fancier, opt for a box of red velvet cake mix. If you\u2019re craving fruity flavors, try strawberry or lemon cake mix. If you like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, make your cookies with carrot cake or spice cake mix. If you want to use your favorite cake mix, go for it!
