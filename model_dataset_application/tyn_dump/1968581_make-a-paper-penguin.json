If you want a larger penguin, then you can easily go for 12\u201d x 12\u201d paper, but you'll have to multiply any directions containing measurements by two. If you want an even better looking penguin, buy paper that is white on one side and black on the other."

Then fold the paper in half diagonally so the bottom left corner is flush with the top right corner and make a crease. Unfold the paper and do the same with the opposite corners, and then unfold the page again. When you unfold the sheet again, you will have creases forming a large X across the page."

In other words, the corner edge will touch the center of the X made by the earlier creases. Flatten the folded portion and make another crease, then open the sheet so it's flat again."

Fold it so that the horizontal edge made at the top of the fold touches the lower crease already on this part of the page\u2014not the middle crease but the one below it.

In other words, fold the other corner (the bottom layer from the previous step) over so that its upper edge is also flush with the same flat side of the page. Especially if you're using a two-colored sheet of paper, this step will make more sense because the form of the penguin will start to become more apparent as the black side of the page will face outward on both sides.

    "Pull it back far enough so that it's just shy of where the little tail is at the bottom of the paper.",
    "Fold the wing back over on itself.",
    "Once you've made the crease from the previous step, fold the wing back over on itself so that the black side is once again facing up.",
    "Fold it so that the tip of the corner is just shy of touching the horizontal white edge at the bottom of the body.",
    "Makes a rabbit's ear fold.",
    "To make the rabbit's ear fold, lift the portion of the wing you just folder and reverse the crease from the last step, but only at the bottom of the crease and only at the depth of roughly the tip of your finger.",
    "This will makes the bottom tip of the wing into a little flap though the flat edge will still be parallel to the rest of the wing.",
    "As with the other complex folds, a visual can help, which you will find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=156.",
    "Repeat steps 14-16 for the other wing.",
    "With one wing complete, you're ready to turn the page over and repeat the same steps to form the other wing.",
    "Simply use the same folds from steps 14-16 but on the other side.",
    "Tuck in the points at the bottom.",
    "The bottom of the penguin will still have points sticking out in a slightly misshapen way.",
    "Fold each of these points toward the inside of the penguin to make a flat, horizontal bottom to the body.",
    "Once you tuck these flaps up, you have your penguin!",
    "Making a Craft Penguin for Children Get one white, one black, and one orange sheet of construction paper.",
    "Since origami can be a bit difficult (and not very exciting) for younger children, the good old method of cutting and gluing construction paper might be more up their alley.",
    "This method of making a paper penguin calls for one white, one black, and one orange sheet of construction paper.",
    "Trace an oval shape onto the black construction paper.",
    "To form the body of the penguin, have the child draw an oblong oval on the black construction paper with either a white crayon or a piece of chalk so that they can see the outline.",
    "One fun and silly way to help the child make the shape is to have him or her place their shoe on the sheet and trace the outline of it.",
    "Cut out the black oval.",
    "Using a pair of scissors (safety scissors for younger children), have the child cut out the black oval from the construction paper.",
    "When it comes to the eyes later, you can have the child either draw them on the white paper or cut pupils out of the black paper.",
    "For the latter, you can have the child cut those out now as well.",
    "Trace a smaller oval onto the white construction paper.",
    "You can now have the child trace the white portion of the belly on the white construction paper.",
    "You can find something of the relative oblong shape to let the child trace it again or simply allow them to do it freehand.",
    "Glue the belly to the rest of the body.",
    "Once the child is done tracing the white oval, allow them to cut the shape out of the construction paper.",
    "Then use a glue stick to glue the tummy portion to the rest of the body.",
    "Glue it closer to the bottom of the body portion than the middle since the head should be above it.",
    "Cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper.",
    "To make the beak for the penguin, have the child cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper.",
    "The beak doesn't have to be an exact triangle, so you can have the child trace it first or simply cut one out.",
    "For very small children, the size of the beak might be too difficult for them to cut out, so you may have to help with this step.",
    "Glue the beak to the penguin's face.",
    "You have two different options to glue the beak to the penguin's face.",
    "You can either glue the triangle flat with one of the points facing downward, or you can actually make a little fold on one of the flat sides and glue it at the tab, which will make the beak stick out from the penguin's face.",
    "Make the penguin's eyes.",
    "As mentioned earlier, you can have the child draw eyes on the white construction paper, cut them out and glue those to the penguin, or you can also have the child cut the whites of the eyes from the white construction paper, then use the black construction paper to cut out the pupils.",
    "A third option if the child is too young to cut out such small circles is to have some googly eyes on hand from a craft store or the craft section of a big-box store.",
    "Young kids may have an easier time using a glue stick to attach google eyes instead.",
    "Let the child customize it.",
    "This makes an easy basic shape for the penguin, and then the child can have fun customizing it.",
    "If the child cuts out two really flattened ovals from the black paper, he or she can glue them to the side of the body as wings.",
    "If the child wants to make feet for the penguin, you can have them trace a leaf or something else with the slight contours to give them the webbed shape."
