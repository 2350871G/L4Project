          "description":"There is no need to worry about life-threatening conditions after an exposure to mold\u2014especially if you aren\u2019t allergic. To determine whether mold exposure is actually causing you harm, schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. Show up and describe the symptoms that you\u2019re experiencing.Tip: There is no such thing as \u201ctoxic mold.\u201d There are toxigenic molds that can promote the growth of dangerous bacteria, but these molds are quite rare. The mold itself isn\u2019t dangerous if the bacteria growing on it is safe. There is no way to determine whether mold is harboring dangerous bacteria or not without getting it tested by a laboratory. Don\u2019t assume that you need to run off to the doctor as soon as you see mold. If you aren\u2019t experiencing any symptoms and you\u2019re not allergic, there isn\u2019t any cause for serious concern so long as you have the mold removed. Mold (such as coccidioides) can grow in certain soils, and it's possible to inhale the spores and develop pneumonia. This can cause flu-like symptoms that last for weeks to months. It's most common in the southwestern United States (California and Arizona), as well as parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America, and you don't need to worry about it if you don't live in these areas. If you have an allergy to mold, your symptoms may include sneezing, itchy eyes, coughing, and wheezing. According to the CDC, all types of mold should be treated with the same degree of seriousness. See your doctor if you have symptoms of an allergy or illness, and take steps to clean the mold, regardless of what type of mold it is. You should seek medical help immediately if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, memory loss, or lethargy after a prolonged exposure to mold. Some bacteria can build up in your lungs and cause infections if you\u2019re exposed to mold for too long. These infections are extremely rare, though. The treatments for mold-based infections are typically steroids or antibiotics. The private companies and labs that perform tests for \u201ctoxic mold exposure\u201d tend to be pseudoscientific and unreliable. Consult your doctor first before going to a private company for testing."

It\u2019s possible that you may have an allergy to mold, and your doctor will be able to answer any of your questions and take a closer look at your skin, eyes, and nasal passages.

Your doctor may tell you to take antihistamines or decongestants to curb your symptoms. Keeping your windows closed and running a dehumidifier will also help curb symptoms from a mold allergy.

If you are allergic, the doctor will prescribe a steroid, antihistamine, or decongestant to help your symptoms. If the mold is in your home, you will need to remove it by either hiring a professional mold removal company or removing the mold and repairing the affected rooms, floors, or areas.

Mycotoxin tests tend to be unreliable and difficult to interpret. There is also a serious debate in the medical community over whether mycotoxins are dangerous when present in small amounts. You're more likely to be exposed to mycotoxins if you work in agriculture, and it's considered an occupational risk. It's best to take precautions to limit your exposure. The only type of mold that produces mycotoxins in high amounts is stachybotrys, which is commonly known as \u201cblack\u201d mold. They can often grow on moldy food as well.

Black mold is the only commonly-found mold that produces mycotoxins. Be sure to check behind your refrigerator, in your air vents, and behind large pieces of furniture.

Moisture meter results are color-coded, and any room that shows up in the green is unlikely to cultivate mold. The yellow category means that the moisture levels are higher than average.

The chemical in the petri dish will absorb mold particles from the air. Put a lid on the dish and seal it. Check it after 2-4 days to see if mold has grown inside the dish. DIY kits are less reliable than a professional service when it comes to identifying mold. If mold grows inside the dish, you have a high percentage of mold in your air.
