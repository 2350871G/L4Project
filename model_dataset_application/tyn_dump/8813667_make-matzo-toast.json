Sandwich the crisp bread with toasted marshmallows and chocolate like s\u2019mores, or knead the raw dough together with cinnamon and brown sugar and bake to make irresistible pull-apart monkey bread. The thin, dense wafers lend themselves perfectly for an after-dinner nibble. It may help to soften the bread with a little water or milk to get it to cooperate in different dessert recipes. Use matzo dough in place of yeasty ingredients so you can enjoy your favorite confections during Passover."

Work quickly\u2014as you handle the dough, the flour will begin to break down, eventually causing it to ferment and rise. Try not to knead the dough for longer than about one minute. You\u2019ll be working against the clock to an extent to keep the bread from leavening. If you\u2019re preparing a large batch, ask for help kneading and rolling the dough."

Stretch and knead these smaller sections, then repeat this process two more times so that you end up with eight pieces. Sprinkle a little more flour onto your work surface, then smooth the dough balls flat with a rolling pin. Each of the finished pieces should be 6-8 inches in diameter and rolled as thinly as possible.

Fit as many pieces onto the baking sheet as you can, making sure the edges don\u2019t overlap. To achieve an ideal texture, try baking on a pizza stone. This will help absorb excess moisture from the dough, resulting in crispier bread. You may need to put the matzo through the oven in rounds if you have dough leftover after the first batch."

The matzo is done when it\u2019s pillowy and golden-brown in the center with dark edges. Be careful not to let it burn.

You can also drizzle it with honey or a mixture of yogurt and water for a softer, sweeter finish. You can also infuse the bread with more potent flavors like shallots and roasted garlic while it\u2019s still hot from the oven. Adding spices and other flavorings to matzo dough prior to baking is not consistent with kosher laws. Keep this in mind when seasoning the bread."
