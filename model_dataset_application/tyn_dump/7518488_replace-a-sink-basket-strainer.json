Inspect the sink carefully, especially next to the hole where the old strainer may have obscured a puncture. A large hole or network of cracks may require a full sink replacement, but you can repair small holes as follows:\nStainless steel sink: Sand the surface around the hole and wipe with an ammonia-based cleaner. Mix, apply, and let cure a two-part stainless steel epoxy according to label instructions. Ceramic sink: Drill any small cracks to create a rough surface. Fill completely with waterproof ceramic putty. Let dry according to label instructions, smoothing it out with a little water just before it dries completely. These repairs may not last forever, but they can last years if properly applied over minor damage."
