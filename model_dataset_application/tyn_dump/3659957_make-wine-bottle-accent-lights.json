Use a 2x8 piece of wood, and lay it lengthwise on a flat surface. Screw in a 12 inch (30.5 cm) piece of wood about a quarter of the way from the edge of the 2x8. This piece of wood is going to be used as a parting stop. Lay a bottle on the 2x8 piece of wood against the first piece of parting stop, and place another parting stop on the other side of the bottle. Hold that parting stop in place and take away the bottle. Then scoot the parting stop in a little bit closer to the already attached parting stop. Drill the second piece of parting stop like you did the first piece. The idea behind the jig is to hold the bottle securely, so it doesn\u2019t roll away as you\u2019re drilling into it."

To get the right drill hole, consider using the Forstner drill bit.

When you are finished drilling, you will most likely have to twist off the stopper from the drill bit. Don\u2019t try to drill the stopper without the jig holding it in place.
