If the disc is an aerobie then the easiest way to catch it is to stick your arm in the large center hole. For Frisbee the easiest way to catch is the alligator method. Take both hands and clamp them around the disc like an alligator. For a one-handed catch: Keep your thumb pointing up if the disk is coming in below your waist. If the disk is coming in high, keep your thumb pointing down. Use whichever position feels most natural for in-between heights. Squeeze your fingers and thumb tightly together to grab the disk just before it smacks into your palm."
