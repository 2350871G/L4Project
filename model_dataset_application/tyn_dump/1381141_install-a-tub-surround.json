          "description":"Locate the main water supply valve for your home. It is often near where the water utility line enters your home. The valve is usually outside, but some homes have a secondary valve inside you can use to disconnect the water. After turning the valve clockwise, go back to your tub and turn on the faucets to let out any water still in the line. If you\u2019re having a hard time finding the valve, look for a large pipe on the lowest floor of your home, such as in the basement or a crawlspace. Follow the pipe to see where it enters your home. Some homes have intermediate valves on supply pipes in the basement or a similar area. Use these valves to deactivate water flow to the bathroom."

That way, you won\u2019t need to worry about needing to fix scratches and chip damage when you\u2019re done. To help keep the drop cloth in place, clip it to the tub or weight it down with heavy items like a toolbox. Drop cloths are available at most hardware stores.

Use the knife to spread the putty in a thin, flat layer. Finish the repair with a coat of spackle. To ensure the repaired portion is level with the wall, sand the putty once it dries.

          "description":"Determine where you will put faucets, showerheads, and other accessories before beginning the installation process. Your options are usually limited by the location of the water pipes in the wall. You will need a different faucet for a pipe coming out of the floor than you do for one coming through the wall, for instance. Other factors to consider include the number of faucet holes in your tub and the overall style of your bathroom. Tub accessories come in a wide variety of styles, so you have a lot of options to choose from. For example, many shower lines emerge from the wall and tub surround, hanging above the tub. If you don\u2019t have a shower line, you could get a freestanding faucet or mount the faucet to the tub. You don\u2019t need to cut holes in the surround to mount these faucets, but you do need to choose a tub with space for them."

          "description":"The bathtub is the most important component, so measure the space you have available for it to ensure it fits well. Set the new tub in place, checking it with a carpenter's level to make sure it's as level as possible. Fasten your tub to the wall studs or mounted brackets if it attaches to the walls. Replace an old tub if necessary, such as if it\u2019s cracked or leaking. Tubs needs to be fitted first since the most common types of surrounds fit on top of them. If your tub is freestanding, buy a bigger surround that fits down the entire length of the wall."

          "headline":"Measure the wall space you have available for a surround.",
          "description":"Tub surrounds come in all different sizes, so take some measurements before you go shopping. Use a tape measure to determine the width and height of the walls around your tub. Write these measurements down on paper. Note that you can find tub surrounds no matter what type of tub you have. Although common surrounds fit over tubs, there are also longer surrounds that extend down the entire length of the wall. This type of surround is great for freestanding tubs. If you have a tub in place and it\u2019s up against the wall, consider measuring up the wall from the top of the tub. That way, you can get a fitting surround without removing the tub. If you\u2019re replacing an old surround, measure it to figure out how big the new one needs to be. This helps if you\u2019re replacing an old surround but not the bathtub."

Some surrounds consist of panels you need to connect together while others come as a whole. Their sizes also vary, so compare your measurements to find the best fit. Plastic-acrylic surrounds are the most common and cheapest options available. They\u2019re lightweight and very easy to glue over any type of wall. Tile surrounds are similar to plastic and acrylic surrounds. They are durable but prone to chip damage. Individual tiles are bound to the surround through grout, which can leak and is difficult to keep clean long-term. Wood, stone, and metal surrounds are high-end. They look nice but are very expensive and often have to be ordered specially from local installers. They are generally durable but heavy and require specialty tools to cut."

Next, hold a carpenter\u2019s level against the wall and connect the marks with a horizontal line. Each tub surround has different dimensions. Refer to the owner\u2019s manual to figure out how high to draw the guideline. The horizontal guideline needs to be plumb even if the tub is not. Make sure the line is straight so you know where to place the surround. Holding the surround against the wall also helps when figuring out where the guidelines go.

Hold the panels against the wall to get a better idea of how they fit. This will give you a clearer image of where you need to make the holes. If dry fitting the panels isn\u2019t an option, measure to find out where to make the accessory holes. Another way to fit the surround is by using the box the surround came in.

    "Fasten your tub to the wall studs or mounted brackets if it attaches to the walls.",
    "Replace an old tub if necessary, such as if it\u2019s cracked or leaking.",
    "Tubs needs to be fitted first since the most common types of surrounds fit on top of them.",
    "If your tub is freestanding, buy a bigger surround that fits down the entire length of the wall.",
    "Measure the wall space you have available for a surround.",
    "Tub surrounds come in all different sizes, so take some measurements before you go shopping.",
    "Use a tape measure to determine the width and height of the walls around your tub.",
    "Write these measurements down on paper.",
    "Note that you can find tub surrounds no matter what type of tub you have.",
    "Although common surrounds fit over tubs, there are also longer surrounds that extend down the entire length of the wall.",
    "This type of surround is great for freestanding tubs.",
    "If you have a tub in place and it\u2019s up against the wall, consider measuring up the wall from the top of the tub.",
    "That way, you can get a fitting surround without removing the tub.",
    "If you\u2019re replacing an old surround, measure it to figure out how big the new one needs to be.",
    "This helps if you\u2019re replacing an old surround but not the bathtub.",
    "Select a new tub surround for your bathroom.",
    "Tub surrounds come in a variety of styles, so shop around to find the best fit for your bathroom.",
    "Some surrounds consist of panels you need to connect together while others come as a whole.",
    "Their sizes also vary, so compare your measurements to find the best fit.",
    "Plastic-acrylic surrounds are the most common and cheapest options available.",
    "They\u2019re lightweight and very easy to glue over any type of wall.",
    "Tile surrounds are similar to plastic and acrylic surrounds.",
    "They are durable but prone to chip damage.",
    "Individual tiles are bound to the surround through grout, which can leak and is difficult to keep clean long-term.",
    "Wood, stone, and metal surrounds are high-end.",
    "They look nice but are very expensive and often have to be ordered specially from local installers.",
    "They are generally durable but heavy and require specialty tools to cut.",
    "Draw guidelines on the wall for the tub surround.",
    "Check the box for the height of your new tub surround.",
    "Use a tape measure to measure up the walls, then mark the height of the surround in several spots.",
    "Next, hold a carpenter\u2019s level against the wall and connect the marks with a horizontal line.",
    "Each tub surround has different dimensions.",
    "Refer to the owner\u2019s manual to figure out how high to draw the guideline.",
    "The horizontal guideline needs to be plumb even if the tub is not.",
    "Make sure the line is straight so you know where to place the surround.",
    "Holding the surround against the wall also helps when figuring out where the guidelines go.",
    "This is hard to do alone, so have a friend hold the surround while you sketch the guidelines.",
    "Mark spots in the surround for the faucets and other accessories.",
    "Lay all of the tub surround panels on the ground, arranging them according to how they fit on the wall.",
    "Then, dry fit some of the panels on the wall.",
    "Find the spots where you need to make holes to let in the water spout, showerhead, and other features.",
    "Outline these parts in pencil on the surround.",
    "Hold the panels against the wall to get a better idea of how they fit.",
    "This will give you a clearer image of where you need to make the holes.",
    "If dry fitting the panels isn\u2019t an option, measure to find out where to make the accessory holes.",
    "Another way to fit the surround is by using the box the surround came in.",
    "Turn it into a template by spreading it out over the wall and marking all of the guidelines.",
    "Use it as a guide while cutting the panels.",
    "Trim the panels to size with a utility knife or jigsaw.",
    "After measuring and fitting the panels on the wall, you will have a good idea of how well the panels fit.",
    "Some panels might be too big, so you may need to trim them down a little.",
    "Sketch a cutting outline using a pencil and straightedge, then carefully slice off the excess material.",
    "Remember to wear a dust mask, eye goggles, and other protective gear.",
    "Avoid long clothing when working with a saw.",
    "Mark cut lines with masking tape to make them more visible.",
    "Set the tape next to where you need to cut, then slice along the edge of the tape to finish the surround.",
    "Cut out the holes for the shower accessories with a saw.",
    "Double-check your measurements to ensure you marked the correct locations on the surround.",
    "Then, carefully cut into the surround with a hole saw or jigsaw.",
    "When you set the panels on the wall, the holes will line up perfectly with features like the spout and showerhead.",
    "You only get 1 shot at making these holes!",
    "If you don't mark and cut the holes properly, you may need to buy a new surround.",
    "Gluing and Sealing the Surround Use a caulk gun and trowel to spread an adhesive over the wall.",
    "Choose an adhesive designed specifically for tub surrounds, which comes in a tube.",
    "Cut the tip off the tube and load it into a caulk gun.",
    "Press the gun\u2019s trigger to spread the adhesive in a zigzag pattern, then smooth it out into a thin, even layer with a trowel.",
    "The adhesive sets quickly.",
    "If your surround comes in multiple pieces, focus on installing 1 section at a time.",
    "Spread more adhesive once you finish installing the first panel.",
    "Press the tub surround flat against the wall.",
    "Lift up the surround and fit it against the wall according to the guidelines you marked.",
    "Make sure it is flush against the wall.",
    "If your surround comes in sections, apply each panel individually, fitting them together.",
    "The easiest way to install panels is usually by starting with the side panels.",
    "Place the back panel next, then finish with the corner panels.",
    "Finish installing the tub\u2019s faucet and other accessories.",
    "Fit new accessories you purchased or return old pieces you had to remove during the installation process.",
    "Place the accessories according to your bathroom and its unique layout.",
    "Some faucets, for instance, fit on a backplate you fit to the wall first.",
    "Others attach directly to bathtubs or a pipe on the floor.",
    "For specialty accessories like grip bars and soap holders, you may need to drill holes in the surround.",
    "Screw the accessory brackets to support beams behind the surround to prevent them from coming loose.",
    "To find the support beams, use a wall stud finder.",
    "If the holes you make in the surround are too big, the accessories won\u2019t fit properly.",
    "You can fill in small gaps with caulk.",
    "If the gaps are so big the accessories don\u2019t fit tightly against the wall, you may need to start over with a new surround.",
    "Let the adhesive dry for 24 hours before continuing.",
    "Leave the surround alone until it adheres properly to the wall.",
    "When you come back to work on the tub the next day, make sure the panels feel impossible to remove.",
    "If they wiggle at all, they aren\u2019t properly bonded to the wall.",
    "Apply more adhesive to stick them in place.",
    "If the surround is loose, water may seep behind it or it may fall down, which can cause a lot of damage.",
    "Seal cracks in the surround and accessories with caulk.",
    "Get a bottle of waterproof silicone caulk and load it into a caulk gun.",
    "Cut the tip off and press the trigger to shoot caulk directly into any spaces that need to be filled.",
    "Then, after letting the caulk dry for 24 hours, turn on the water supply to enjoy your new surround.",
    "You will need to squeeze a bead of caulk between the tub and the bottom of the surround.",
    "If your surround came in panels, also put caulk between each panel.",
    "While you have caulk available, spread a bead of caulk underneath fixtures like the faucet escutcheon to waterproof it."
