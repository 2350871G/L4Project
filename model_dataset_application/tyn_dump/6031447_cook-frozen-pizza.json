          "description":"Before you get cooking, pull your pizza out of the freezer and set it on your countertop to thaw to room temperature. If you bake your pizza while it\u2019s still frozen, the outer layer of frost will melt and turn to steam, leaving the crust and toppings a soggy, chewy mess. Be sure to put your pizza in the oven as soon as it\u2019s finished defrosting. The simplest way to ensure that your frozen pizza is thoroughly thawed is to leave it out of the freezer when you get it home from store (unless you\u2019re not planning on eating it right away)."

Slide the palm of your hand underneath the pizza and pull it out, making sure it\u2019s facing up. Then, peel away and discard the outer plastic wrap and cardboard base. You may need a pair of scissors to help you get the plastic wrap open. If you accidentally open your pizza upside down, the toppings may fall off or end up distributed unevenly."

As it heats up in the oven or microwave, it will absorb into the crust, producing a smooth, subtle taste and extra crispy texture. A light coating of olive oil will also help brown the cheese next to the crust nicely.Tip: Sprinkle on some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, or parmesan cheese for an even more delicious finish."
