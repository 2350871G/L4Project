Wipe down each crystal with the damp cloth, then immediately dry with a separate dry cloth. Try wearing an apron with pockets while you work, so that you can keep the cleaner, cloths, and any other supplies easily on hand. Instead of two cloths, you can wear two soft cotton gloves for better control and dexterity. Spray one glove with the cleaner to wipe crystals down, and keep the other glove clean to dry them. If you have a lot of crystals, you may want several pairs of gloves."

When cleaning the crystals, always spray cleaner onto a cloth first, rather than directly onto the fixture. While cleaning, don\u2019t twist or rotate the chandelier to access each side or part. This could damage or weaken its parts or supports, risking falling and breakage.

Ensure that you use a cleaner that is intended for the type of metal or other material that your chandelier frame is made out of, otherwise you run the risk of discoloring or tarnishing it. Clean any metal hooks or fasteners for the crystals with a dry cloth only, as cleaner can tarnish or strip the finish off of them."

If a bulb appears to have more stubborn stains, you can very gently clean it with a cloth damp with cleaner, or replace the bulb entirely."
