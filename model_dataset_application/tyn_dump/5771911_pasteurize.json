          "description":"Fill the bottom pan of a double boiler with approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water. Then place the smaller pan on top of the bottom one and pour the liquid or food you are pasteurizing into it. Set the double boiler on a burner on your stove. If you do not have a double boiler, you can use the combination of a large stockpot and a small saucepan, metal bowl, or thick glass bowl. The smaller dish must be small enough to rest in the top of the larger stockpot without the bottom of it sitting in the water. To prevent the bottom of the smaller dish from touching the bottom of the larger stockpot, place a metal cookie cutter inside the stockpot and rest the smaller dish on top of it.Tip: Since the liquid you are pasteurizing will not actually reach a boil, you can fill the top dish of the double boiler fairly high. However, leave at least 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the dish to further reduce the risk of overflow."

You will know it's simmering when you start to see steam coming out between the two levels of the double boiler. Once the water comes to a simmer, turn down the heat to low or medium-low. The goal is to control the heat by keeping the water at a steady simmer instead of a rolling boil."

    "While some people try to sterilize jars in a dishwasher, it doesn't guarantee sterilization the way that boiling containers does.Tip: To prevent the containers from knocking into each other during the sterilization process, you may wish to place a clean dish towel at the bottom of the stockpot.",
    "Do so now instead of waiting until after the water boils.",
    "Fill the stockpot with water until it covers the jars by 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm).",
    "Put enough water into the stockpot to completely cover the storage containers so that they are heated evenly.",
    "Set the stockpot on the stove once it is full.",
    "It is best to arrange the containers inside of the stockpot before bringing the water to a boil.",
    "Glass tends to crack or otherwise break when exposed to rapid changes in temperature, so submerging the jars after the water has already reached a boil can be risky.",
    "Boil the water for 10 minutes.",
    "Turn on your burner to high heat.",
    "Continue heating the water until it reaches a steady boil and then turn down the heat to keep the water at a low boil.",
    "Allow the containers and covers to stay submerged for 10 minutes after the water comes to a full boil.",
    "The containers may bump into each other a bit while being boiled.",
    "However, if the water is at a low boil, the containers should not hit each other enough to damage them.",
    "Remove the containers from the water.",
    "Turn the burner off once the jars are sterilized.",
    "Then carefully lift the containers and covers out of the hot water using tongs or a canning jar lifter.",
    "Use caution when removing the glass containers since they can still break easily at this stage.",
    "Let the containers dry on your counter.",
    "Set them aside on clean, dry dish towels and allow them to air dry.",
    "Do not place the containers in a refrigerator or freezer to speed the cooling process.",
    "Putting the containers in the refrigerator or freezer while they are hot could cause the glass to break.",
    "You do not need the containers to cool completely to room temperature.",
    "Containers that are slightly warm are less likely to break during pasteurization."
