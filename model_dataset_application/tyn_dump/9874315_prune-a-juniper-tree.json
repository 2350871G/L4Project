It\u2019s easier to see the dead zone in the early spring when there isn\u2019t much new growth. Sometimes, if the juniper is very mature, the dead zone will be extremely large.

Use a pair of pruners or loppers to cut 30% of the central limbs out of the tree, opting for the most mature branches. Cut these branches into the dead zone to prevent them from growing back. Doing this helps to prevent disease in the bush and allows more light to reach the buds at junctions toward the center of the tree.

Use twine or tree ties to secure the branches to the center of the tree. Tie the twine around the branch and then secure it to the middle of the shrub. Do not use wire to do this unless you are also using tree straps around the branches. Wire will rub against them. Tree ties tend to be sturdier than twine, but they\u2019re more expensive. You can find them at most home improvement stores or garden centers. After a year, you will need to remove the ties, and the branches should remain in place without the ties."
