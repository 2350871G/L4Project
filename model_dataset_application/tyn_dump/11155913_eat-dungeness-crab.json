          "description":"It\u2019s important that all the crabs you're cooking will fit into the pan with at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of space between the top of the water and the rim of the pan. To check, you\u2019ll need to grab the crabs by the back of the shell (between their back legs), plop them into the pan, and look for those spare inches of room. Take the crabs out after you\u2019ve checked. If handling or boiling live crabs is unappealing to you, you can kill them first by flipping them belly up and whacking them on the underside (just above the abdomen) with a blunt object like the heavy handle of a knife."

          "headline":"Prepare the pot with boiling water.",
          "description":"Boiling water is one of the best and simplest ways to cook crab. Fill the pot with tap water about 3/4 of the way full and bring it to a rolling boil. Since their natural habitat is saltwater, add about \u20442 cup (8.0 US tbsp) of sea salt per 1 gallon (4.0 US qt) of water to retain their salty-sweet flavor. You can also add any other seasonings to the water, but don\u2019t overdo it so you can still taste the flavor of the crab itself! Kosher salt (or any salts with large granules) is a good choice of salt. Add \u20442 cup (8.0 US tbsp) per 1 gallon (4.0 US qt) of water to try to mimic the saltiness of seawater. If you don\u2019t know exactly how much water you have, add the salt while the water is warming and taste it\u2014add more until it tastes just as salty as seawater. Add 3 tablespoons (0.19  c) of Old Bay Seasoning per 1 gallon (4.0 US qt) of water to amp up the flavor."

          "headline":"Add the crabs to the boiling water.",
          "description":"Once the water is at a rolling boil, grasp each crab at the back of their shells (between the hind legs) and put them into the pot one by one. You can use tongs or your hands for this, but be careful to avoid any boiling backsplash! If the water rises to leave less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) between it and the rim of the pot, stop and ladle some out before adding the next crab. Grab the crabs with an oven mitt or towel for extra protection against boiling backsplash. Leave the pot uncovered (to prevent boiling over) and plan to boil the crabs for 12 to 15 minutes."

          "description":"An ice water bath will cool down the crabs after cooking, preventing the meat from getting overdone since the water inside the shells will continue to boil after removing them from the pot. Cooling them will also make them easier to handle during the cleaning process. Place the ice water bath in close proximity to the stove for quick and easy access."

Carefully grab each crab by the shell with a pair of tongs and plop them into the ice bath. Be very cautious because the steam will be extremely hot! Wear an oven mitt to protect your hands."

          "description":"After about 10 minutes in the ice bath, poke one or two of the shells with your finger to see if they\u2019ve cooled down enough. You'll want them to be slightly warm and comfortable to handle. Remember, the insides will be even hotter, so if they feel hot, leave them in the ice bath for 5 or 10 more minutes before testing again. If some crabs are exposed, add more ice water to completely cover all of them. Once they\u2019ve cooled to a comfortable handling temperature, place them on a large cutting board to be cleaned."

    "Smash the shells with a mallet around each joint for easier eating.",
    "Slightly pre-cracking the shells with a small hammer or the flat side of a meat tenderizer will make it easier to take out and eat the meat at the table.",
    "Aim for the areas just above and below the joints, since that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be cracking the shells later on for the easiest meat access.",
    "You\u2019ll still need crab crackers but you won\u2019t have to apply as much force if the shells are already a little pre-cracked.",
    "If you plan to eat them a few hours later, cover and refrigerate them until the time comes to dig in!",
    "Enjoying Dungeness Crab Prepare the melted garlic butter dipping sauce.",
    "Melted butter is the classic accompaniment to dungeness crab and will complement its naturally sweet, salty flavor.",
    "Place 1 cup (16 US tbsp) of salted butter into a small saucepan with 2 peeled cloves of garlic and heat on low until it\u2019s fully melted.",
    "Once it\u2019s melted, pour it through a small sieve into a medium-sized bowl to strain out the milk solids.",
    "Pour the dipping butter into individual dipping saucers, one for each person eating.",
    "Squeeze a slice of lemon and add a pinch of ground thyme to the butter while its melting for an extra zing of decadent flavor.",
    "If you saved the crab butter during the cleaning process, stir some (or all of it) into the prepared dipping butter for an extra-decadent bite.",
    "Use a seafood cracker to get to the leg and claw meat.",
    "Seafood crackers are essential for cracking open the tough shells of dungeness crab.",
    "They look a bit like nut crackers and you can probably find them at your local grocery store.",
    "Place the cracking grips around the legs just above or below the joints and firmly squeeze the two handles together.",
    "Rotate the leg around so the cracker\u2019s grips get a firm hold on the shell.",
    "You may have to do a few cracks on different sides of the shell to fully break it open.",
    "You might have to use two hands to squeeze the handles together, especially on tougher parts of the legs and claws.",
    "Scoop out the meat with a seafood pick.",
    "A seafood pick has a small spoon at one end and tiny 2-pronged fork at the other, perfect for reaching down deep into the legs to pull out that juicy meat!",
    "Insert the small fork end into the shell and move it around the perimeter of the inside of the shell to loosen up the meat before scooping it out.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a seafood pick, a long, small object like a knife or toothpick will also work (but you might not get all the meat).",
    "Dip the meat in melted butter and enjoy.",
    "Once you have your crab meat on the small fork, dunk it into your saucer of dipping butter and enjoy!",
    "If you saved some crab butter from the cleaning process, feel free to add a small dollop of that on top of the meat as well.",
    "To add a little spice to your meal, add 1 tablespoon (0.50  fl oz) of wasabi to your plate and put a little on each bite of meat.",
    "If you like an extra dose of citrusy zing, have a small wedge of lime ready to squeeze on the crab meat."
