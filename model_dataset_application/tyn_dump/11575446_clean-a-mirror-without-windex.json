After securing the lid on the spray bottle, shake the mixture vigorously so both ingredients can mix together. Always use equal parts vinegar and water when making a glass cleaning solution. Distilled water is a good option for households with hard water. If your home doesn\u2019t have hard water, feel free to use the tap instead.Tip: If you\u2019d prefer not to use vinegar in your cleaning mixture, you can stir a few drops of dish soap into a spray bottle of warm water."

If you\u2019re cleaning a smaller mirror, only use 1-2 squirts of the vinegar solution to clean your mirror. Although it might seem logical to directly spray the mirror, you can actually cause more streaks this way. Microfiber cloths are the best wipes to use when cleaning glass, as they don\u2019t leave streaks or smudges."

Keep alternating with horizontal and diagonal strokes, cleaning the mirror in a downwards zig-zag until you reach the bottom edge. Work in quick, rapid motions as you wipe down the mirror."
