    "Start by brushing downward across the decoupage, from the painter's tape down to the edge of the tumbler.",
    "Wipe the brush off on the rim of the decoupage bottle, then move onto the next section.",
    "Keep doing this until an even layer of glue remains and you can't see any streaks.",
    "Shake on some fine glitter.",
    "Hold your tumbler over a paper plate or a sheet of paper.",
    "Choose some fine, scrapbooking glitter in a color that you like.",
    "Shake the glitter over the tumbler, rotating the tumbler while doing so.",
    "Don't worry if the glitter doesn't come out even.",
    "You'll be adding a second coat shortly.",
    "Let the tumbler dry for 1 to 2 hours.",
    "Carefully set the tumbler upside down on a sheet of paper, with the glittered portion facing up.",
    "Wait 1 to 2 hours for it to dry.",
    "In the meantime, you can use your paper plate to transfer the glitter back into its container.",
    "Apply another coat of decoupage and another coat of glitter.",
    "Once again, brush on a thick coat of decoupage.",
    "This time, be sure to extend it just past the glitter and onto the bottom edge of the tumbler.",
    "Wipe the excess decoupage off, just like before, and shake some more glitter onto it.",
    "Wait for the decoupage to dry, then apply two more coats of decoupage, allowing each coat to dry.",
    "Allow the glitter to dry first, about 1 to 2 hours.",
    "Next, apply a thick coat of decoupage, wipe away any excess, and let it dry for 1 to 2 hours.",
    "Apply a second and final coat of decoupage, wipe off any excess, and let it dry.",
    "When applying these last two coats of decoupage, be sure to extend it just past the glitter and onto the bottom edge of the tumbler.",
    "This helps to seal the glitter in.",
    "Carefully peel the tape away.",
    "Lift the tape straight up rather than downwards so that you don't accidentally peel off the glitter.",
    "Discard the tape when you are done.",
    "Seal the top edge in, and let it dry.",
    "Using small, downward strokes, apply some decoupage to the top edge of the glitter part of your tumbler.",
    "When you are done, there should be a thin line of decoupage between the glittered and plain parts of the tumbler.",
    "This helps to seal in the glitter further.",
    "At this point, your tumbler is done.",
    "You can make it fancier by adding vinyl letters or designs, or sketching on patterns using a permanent marker.",
    "Allow the tumbler to dry completely before using it.",
    "Each brand of decoupage glue will be a little different, so be sure to refer to the packaging.",
    "Once the glue is dry, your tumbler is ready to use.",
    "You should only wash the inside and upper rim.",
    "If the glittered part gets dirty, wipe it down with a damp cloth, then dry it immediately.",
    "Do not let the tumbler sit in water or wash it in the dishwasher, or the glitter will peel away."
