Extra-virgin olive oil will give your marinara sauce a much richer flavor than ordinary olive oil will. Medium heat is the middle number on your stovetop dial. For example, if your dial runs from 1 to 10, turn it to 5 to set it to medium heat."

If you want to add a bit of a savory flavor to your sauce, you can also add about 1 cup (75 grams) of chopped mushrooms to the pan and saute them along with the diced onions."
