Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Then stir in 1/2 cup of lime or lemon juice. Refrigerate the mixture until it's cool. To quickly cool the syrup before you freeze it, fill a large bowl with ice. Set the bowl that has your hot syrup on top of the ice in the larger bowl. Leave it there for 15 minutes till it's cooler."

It will also make it easier to scrape or mix in a machine. Cover the pan with plastic wrap to prevent the Italian ice from absorbing smells from your freezer. If you want the mixture to freeze even faster, place the shallow pan in the freezer before you start making your Italian ice puree. This way, the pan will already be cold."

Freeze it again for another 2 hours until the mixture is firm. This will a crystallized Italian ice that you can serve. If you used a syrup base instead of the puree, you'll need to freeze the mixture longer before initially scraping. Freeze it for 1 1/2 hours, scrape the mixture with a fork, and then freeze it for another 1 1/2 hours before serving."

Once frozen, remove the mixture and put it in a blender. Cover the blender with the lid and pulse the blender until the mixture is shaved. This will make a lighter Italian ice. If you don't have a blender, transfer the frozen mixture to a large bowl. Use a hand mixer with beater attachments to blend the mixture until it's as smooth as you want it."

This freezing method is hands off and will make a much smoother Italian ice. Pour the cold pureed mixture into your machine and follow the manufacturer's instructions. You should still be around when freezing the Italian ice in the ice cream maker. Most ice cream makers should only be run for about 20 to 30 minutes.
