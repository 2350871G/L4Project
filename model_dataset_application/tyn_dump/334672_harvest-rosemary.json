Even if you are not harvesting it to use, you should prune rosemary several times a year to encourage healthy growth. Remember not to harvest rosemary too close to winter because it will not grow back very fast. Perform your last harvest at least 2 weeks before the first frost so it has time to grow back before winter sets in. Bigger, fuller rosemary bushes are able to survive winter better."

Take down the rosemary when it is completely dry, after about 10 days, and strip off the leaves to store them. Store the dried rosemary leaves in airtight containers or jars in your cupboards or pantry. Use twine or rubber bands to hold the bundles of rosemary together. Dried rosemary will last forever, but it has the best flavor within a year."

Strip off the leaves, place them into a ziploc bag or tupperware, and put it in the fridge or freezer. Storing rosemary in the fridge or freezer will retain more of the flavor than dried rosemary, but less than fresh rosemary. Rosemary stored in the freezer will last longer than in the fridge, but the rosemary in the fridge will have a stronger flavor. Use rosemary that you keep in the fridge within 1-2 weeks for best results."

Use these cubes in sauces or soups to easily get a fresh rosemary taste in your recipes. The amount of leaves you freeze per cube is up to you. Check how much rosemary a common recipe you might make requires, and freeze that amount in one cube. Once the rosemary is frozen, you can empty the ice cube tray and store the cubes in an airtight container or ziploc bag in the freezer. Choose water or olive oil depending on what types of recipes you plan to use the ice cubes in. If you don\u2019t know, then you can do some of each. Rosemary stored in the freezer will last indefinitely. If it starts to noticeably lose its flavor, then make a new batch."

Use rosemary oil or vinegar in recipes, or combine them in a dish to create a dipping sauce for bread. Add other ingredients to the oil or vinegar infusions such as fresh garlic, peppercorns, or chili peppers for more flavor! Rosemary oil or vinegar will last as long as the rosemary stays covered by the oil or vinegar. If it becomes exposed to the air it can develop mold."
