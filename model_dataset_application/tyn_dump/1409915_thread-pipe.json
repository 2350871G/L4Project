Place the pipe in the vise so the end you want to thread is sticking out, then turn the handle back clockwise to tighten it and secure it in place. Note that you can use either a regular table vise or a pipe vise that is specially designed for holding piping in place. This method uses a ratcheting pipe threader to cut threads into the end of a pipe. A ratcheting pipe threader consists of a long ratcheting handle that holds a circular die head at one end, which is a ring with several sets of teeth inside of it that cut the threads. When you ratchet the handle, the die head spins onto the end of the pipe, cutting the threads as it goes on. If you don\u2019t have all the equipment or don\u2019t want to purchase or rent it, you can also have pipes threaded for you at a home improvement center."

Ratcheting pipe threaders typically come with die heads in a few different common diameters. The face of the die head has numbers on it that indicate the size of pipe it is for. For example, if it says 1/2 on it, the die head is for threading 1/2-inch piping. You can purchase or rent a ratcheting pipe threader and die heads at a home improvement center or hardware store.
