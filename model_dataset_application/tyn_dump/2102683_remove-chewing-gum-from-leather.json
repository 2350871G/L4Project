The coldness of the ice will harden the gum, making it easier to chip away later. If the leather item is small enough, place it in a plastic bag and then put it in the freezer for about an hour. Putting the item in the freezer will have a similar effect as the ice--the gum will harden and become easier to chip away from the leather. If you don\u2019t have a plastic bag, you can rub the ice directly on the gum. Make sure that if the ice drips onto the leather, you wipe it up immediately, as water left on leather for too long can stain it."
