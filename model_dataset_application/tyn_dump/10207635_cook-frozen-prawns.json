Bring the pot to a boil, and then remove it from the heat. Stir in the prawns, and cover the pot. The prawns should be done in 5-6 minutes, when they're pink and opaque. Add in aromatics and other flavors like half a lemon with the juice squeezed in, 3-4 garlic cloves, 1/4 of an onion, a handful of parsley, and/or 12-15 peppercorns. The amounts do not need to be precise, as they are just adding flavor. You can be as light or as heavy-handed as you'd like. Try a 1/2 a teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt to 8 to 9 cups (1.9 to 2.1 L) of water, which will easily hold 1 pound (0.45 kg) of prawns."

Toss the frozen, rinsed prawns in the seasoning mix of your choice, such as a Cajun seasoning mix. Once the pan is hot, pull it out with a oven mitt, and pour the prawns on the pan. Put them back in the oven to cook for about 5 minutes. You can make your own Cajun blend or simply buy some from the store. You could also use taco seasoning or just sprinkle on some rosemary, basil, and garlic. The prawns will curl slightly when they're done. If the prawns clump up as you pour them, use tongs to spread them out."
