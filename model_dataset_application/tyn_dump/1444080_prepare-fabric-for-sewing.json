If you have not yet removed the selvage edges, make a vertical cut just beyond the selvage edge. Repeat on the other end. To check that the grain is straight, fold the fabric lengthwise so the selvage edges meet and the top and bottom are straight. If there is any distortion in the fabric, it may need to be pressed with a steam iron, working from the selvage edges to the fold."

Dry in the dryer, and remove the fabric while still slightly damp. Iron the fabric until it is completely dry, using the recommended heat setting for each fabric. Delicate fabrics that cannot go in the dryer should be line dried or laid flat until almost dry and ready to be ironed. Apply fusible interfacing before sewing thin cotton fabrics that might otherwise twist and bunch. The interfacing will help stabilize the fabric when when sewing. Turn the steam iron to its highest setting. Lay the fabric, right side down, on an ironing board. Place the interfacing, glue side down, on top of the fabric. Slightly dampen a cloth kitchen towel and place on top of the interfacing. Activate the steam feature, and hold in place for 10 seconds.  Check to see if the fabrics have fused, and continue on until all your fabric is stabilized.  Preshrink dry-clean only fabric by ironing across the grain of the fabric in horizontal and vertical passes with a steam iron. Ironing against the grain can distort the fabric.
