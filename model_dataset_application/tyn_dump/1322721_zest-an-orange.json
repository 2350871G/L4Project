If you are using a box grater, simply place the grater on top of the cutting board. This will stabilize the grater for easier zesting, and it will allow you to see how much zest you\u2019ve made as you\u2019re working."

          "headline":"Scrape the orange along the grater from top to bottom.",
          "description":"Drag the orange along the grater toward the cutting board, maintaining enough pressure to remove the top layer of the rind. Once you reach the end of the board, lift up the orange and place it at the top of the zester again. Try to avoid pulling the orange from the bottom of the zester to the top, which can clog the holes or damage the skin of the orange. If you\u2019re having trouble holding the orange while you zest it, cut the orange in half and squeeze the juice into a cup to make it smaller and easier to hold in your hand. Without the juice in the orange, the rind will be more pliable, and you can mold it into a shape that\u2019s comfortable for you to hold."

Normally, you\u2019ll reach the pith after zesting an area 1-2 times, and then turn the orange slightly to continue zesting. The pith of the orange has a bitter taste, which is unpleasant for most recipes. If you do end up accidentally zesting the pith, stop and pick the white parts out of the zest."

If you have enough for your recipe, set your zested oranges aside to use the juice or flesh later. One medium-sized orange should yield about 1-1.5 tablespoons (6-9 grams) of zest. If you need more for your recipe, wash another orange to zest some more."
