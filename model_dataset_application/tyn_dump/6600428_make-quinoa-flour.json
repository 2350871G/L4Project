If you don't have an electric seed grinder, you could use a manual seed grinder, coffee grinder, or high-powered food processor. Load the appliance up to two-thirds full with quinoa seeds. For smaller grinders, you may need to grind the quinoa in several batches to avoid over-filling the appliance. Over-filling the grinder will prevent it from processing the quinoa properly and may result in coarse flour."

When using a small grinder, carefully shake the appliance in between pulses to help shift and spread the seeds. When using a larger grinder or food processor, you may need to pause and stir the contents after several pulses to help redistribute the remaining seeds. After grinding down the quinoa seeds, you've created quinoa flour that can technically be used as it is. Since raw quinoa flour has such a bitter taste, however, you should toast it before use to tone it down."
