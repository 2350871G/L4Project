While the acid you will use in this method may curdle the milk on its own when used in large enough quantities, heat dramatically accelerates the process, making the milk curdle faster and more noticeably. This is especially important if you plan to separate the solid curds from the liquid whey, as you would do when making cheese. Note that you can also curdle milk using nothing but heat, as outlined in another method of this article. Doing so will produce smaller curds, though, so this method is recommended if you need larger curds."

          "description":"Add an acidic ingredient like lemon juice, orange juice, or vinegar to the hot milk. Whisk it in to incorporate thoroughly. Milk contains a protein called casein. Casein groupings are usually spread throughout milk evenly, but when milk becomes acidic, the negative charge keeping the casein groupings separate is neutralized. As a result, the casein proteins clump together, causing the milk to become grainy and curdle. Lemon juice is generally the preferred acid of choice, followed by vinegar. Both are more acidic than orange juice or other common kitchen acids. The more acid you add, the larger your curds will be and the faster they will form. For smaller \u201cgrains\u201d of curds, use a smaller amount of acid."

Once the milk reaches a boil, allow it to boil for a full 1 to 2 minutes. Note that high-fat dairy products, like cream, can be boiled with little to no problem. As a result, you may find that low-fat milk takes very little time to boil and curdle while whole milk will take longer. Milk will not begin to curdle until it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). To maximize and speed up the curdling effect, let the temperature climb even higher. You can monitor the temperature using a clip-on instant food thermometer. Stir the milk occasionally but not frequently. Stirring will spread the heat throughout the liquid, but it will also cause the milk to take longer to reach a boil. Leave the saucepan uncovered."
