          "description":"Wipe away any food spills with a washcloth or paper towel. Apply baking soda or a mild countertop cleaner to your washcloth to help prevent the spills from staining. To clean spills with baking soda, make a paste by mixing your baking soda with water in a ratio of 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of water for \u00bd cup (104 g) of baking soda. Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for 5 minutes, and wipe it off with a washcloth. Epoxy countertops stain easily. Cleaning spills as you notice them will keep it in its best condition."

Wipe the countertop with the washcloth to help maintain its natural shine. You can find pH-balanced dish soaps by checking the label or searching for balanced dish soaps online."

Don't apply too much mineral oil to the washcloth, as this can cloud your countertop's surface. You can wipe away excess mineral oil with a dry cloth. Only use mineral oil once a week maximum or else it could create a haze on your countertop. You can buy mineral oil, also known as finish oil, online or at most home improvement stores."

Dip a washcloth in nail polish remover and rub the stain away in circular motions. If the stain doesn't lift easily, apply more pressure as you rub. Check the nail polish's label to make sure it contains acetone. Nail polish remover can make the fabric dye come off of your washcloth. Use a white rag to prevent staining your countertop with fabric dyes. Avoid using bleach to remove stains, as bleach can stain epoxy countertop."

For persistent marring, apply acetone to a sponge or light-duty scrubber and use mild pressure to remove the marring. Marring refers to rough patches or light scratches on your countertop. Never use abrasive pads or cleaners to remove scratches, as they can dull your countertop's shine."

Using circular motions will prevent the buffer from leaving a pattern on the surface. Move the drill back and forth in even motions to work the polishing paste into the scratch.
