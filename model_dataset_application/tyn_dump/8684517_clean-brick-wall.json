Brush a thin coating of sealant over the entire wall surface and give it ample time to dry. The sealant will help fill in weak spots, making the brick more resilient to damage and inclement weather conditions. Choose a day with clear, dry weather in the forecast to apply brick sealant. Precipitation and humidity can result in less efficient coverage. Don\u2019t apply a sealant until brick is totally clean, or you may end up locking in dirt for good."

If you have a power washer or a hose with a separate pressure nozzle, you can use it on a low pressure setting to knock out dirt that has settled down deep.
