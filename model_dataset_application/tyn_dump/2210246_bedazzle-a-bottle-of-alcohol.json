This won't be as noticeable with clear glass, but it will be noticeable with colored glass. Use painter's tape on labels. Do not use masking tape, or you'll rip the paper.

If your bottle has a molded design, such as a tufted diamond pattern, you could apply tiny rhinestones to just the creases. Here are some more design ideas:\nCreate a centerpiece on the bottle with a large, ornate jewel, then add smaller jewels around it. Leave the rest of the bottle blank. Create rings of rhinestones for a striped effect. How much space you leave between the rings is up to you. Glue tiny rhinestones randomly or in a grid-like pattern for a subtle effect.

It is great for bedazzling an entire bottle or outlining labels. Individual rhinestones are better if you need a specific look. The rhinestones don't have to look like crystals. Consider flat-backed pearls or beads! Get a variety pack of rhinestones if you want more texture. Make sure that the pack includes different shapes, sizes, and colors. Use rhinestones that are all the same shape, size, and color for a uniform look. Get a few extra rhinestones that are a little smaller/larger to fill in gaps."

If the glue does not have a nozzle, then squeeze out a small amount, and apply it with a toothpick or craft stick. Rhinestone glue, such as Gem Tac, is great for individual rhinestones. It is difficult to peel off. Industrial-strength glue, such as E6000, is better for larger rhinestones. It offers a strong bond, but it can peel off."

Apply another line of glue right above the first row, and wrap the trim around the bottle again. Keep going until you get the coverage you want. You can start from the top of the bottle instead, but make sure that your ring is straight. If your bottle has a foil top, finish the trim just below the foil. Use a pearl trim for a more elegant touch. Make sure that the pearls have a flat back; they will be easier to glue on than spherical pearls."

Finish each patch before starting on the next. Avoid placing 2 rhinestones of the same color, shape, and size next to each other. You don't have to let the glue dry and cure completely before moving onto the next patch. About 10 to 15 minutes should be enough. The size of the patches doesn't really matter. Plan on working on 5 to 7 rhinestones at a time, however. Use some non-rhinestone gems for even more texture, such as pearls."

Give the bottle a quick coat of a clear-drying glue or spray sealer, then shake some glitter onto it. This works especially well over smooth, pearl trims. If you are using spray sealer, it must be glossy, or you will dull down the rhinestones. Use glitter that is the same color as your rhinestones to help blend it in some more.
