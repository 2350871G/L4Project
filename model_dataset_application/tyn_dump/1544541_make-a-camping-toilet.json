          "description":"Use measuring tape to measure the circumference of the rim of the bucket. Then, use a utility knife to cut your noodle to be about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) shorter than this measurement. The noodle needs to be slightly shorter than the bucket\u2019s circumference so that you\u2019re able to fit it entirely around the rim of the bucket without the edges of the noodle\u2019s ends bumping up against each other."

          "description":"Draw a line down the length of the noodle from top to bottom to guide your knife when you go to slice it. Opening the noodle this way will allow you to set it snugly along the rim of the bucket. After you cut open the side of the noodle, use your hands to gently pull the 2 sides of the cut you just made apart. Make sure the noodle has been completely cut open before you move on to the next step."

Then, place the noodle onto the rim of the bucket and push it downward so that it \u201csnaps\u201d into place. You can also opt to skip the epoxy adhesive entirely and just make your toilet out of a bucket and pool noodle. However, without the epoxy, the noodle seat will be less secure when you go to sit on it. You can buy epoxy adhesive at any home improvement store. For best results, allow your epoxy to cure for at least 24 hours before using your camping toilet."
