Choose to print your design in grayscale or color and click the \u201cPrint\u201d button on your computer. Wait until the printer is completely finished before removing the sheet of tattoo paper. You can buy tattoo paper at most craft stores or online. If you have a laser printer, then you can use standard printer paper. Make sure you still reverse the design, and set it to grayscale since laser printers can't do color."

However, you need to use helium if you want your balloons to float in the air. Put the neck of the balloon over the helium tank's nozzle and turn it on to release the gas and inflate your balloon.Tip: You can transfer designs onto Mylar or latex balloons. If you're transferring onto a Mylar balloon, you do not need to inflate it first."

Be careful not to press too hard on the balloon if it's inflated since it could pop."
