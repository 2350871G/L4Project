      "headline":"Get one or more guardians.",
      "description":"Some suggestions are the Phoenix/Icy Arctic Fowl, Korblox Flying Oblivion Horn, Orinthian Falcon, Bald Eagle, and Ghost Minion. One tactic to win (it might not be as fun, but it works) is to just get all of these and use all of them at once."

    {
      "headline":"Get a long ranged weapon (optional).",
      "description":"You should get the M1 Garand with infinite ammo, 8 bullets in a clip (for some reason, you can't manually reload) and 30 damage. Performing a headshot is an instant kill. If you are more worried about killing a certain person, use the potato cannon. It won't give you a KO, but it's a very good long ranged weapon."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get a good close range weapon (optional).",
      "description":"A good close range weapon is the Scatter Blaster and the Trench Warfare. The Trench Warfare is a powerful shotgun. If you are close enough, it's a two hit KO. A Scatterblaster is also deadly, but you can get hit by your own bullets since you are fast"

    {
      "headline":"Get a good Medium Range weapon (optional).",
      "description":"A good medium range weapon is the Sten gun, It's like a SMG, but it's much stronger. It wouldn't hurt to use the Luger Pistol too."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get Some Flying Gear.",
      "description":"Make sure you have some flying gear, in case you fall. Pompous, Santa's Sleigh, Artemis Bow, Sinister Flying Carpet, and Golden Fleece are some good choices. Also, you can use the hover glitch (it's kind of a cheat, so you shouldn't use it)\nGet the Green Epic Sauce. Search 'green' and click the green bottle. Get the Moonwalk Potion. Search for 'moonwalk'\nGet out the Green Epic Sauce\nDrink it and then quickly drink the Moonwalk Potion. You are now temporarily hovering."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get Health Items.",
      "description":"If you ever get damaged, make sure you have a quick slight healing source and a healing potion. If you have VIP, regenerating a healing potion is very easy as it's on the top bar. Your quick healing source can be Beans or Bloxy Cola. You can also use the health glitch (it's kind of a cheat, so you shouldn't use it). There are a few ways to do it, but here is one:\nGet the Knights of the Splintered Skies Wing Potion. Search 'knights' and click the blue potion. Get the Dragonshead. Search for 'drag.' Get out your potion. Drink it and then quickly switch to the Dragonshead. You are now invincible to any melee weapon and most other weapons."

      "headline":"Get a RC Tank.",
      "description":"This is not needed, but let's say you're lazy. Find a good hiding spot or a safe spot, then summon a RC Tank. That thing is pretty resistant, but explosives are its weakness."

      "headline":"Try using some other useful/fun weapons.",
      "description":"They are as follows: Epicsauce, Merely's Sparkle Time Hoverboard, Bear Mine Gun, Snake Sniper, Seranok Golden Chalice of Fame, Conjurer's Fist, Zeus's Lightning Bolt, Freeze Ray, Astral Cloak of Transportation, Dual Plungers, Medusa Head, Arachnix Drone, Finger Laser, Fist of Schoolage, Gravity Gun, Forbidden Box, Tornado Staff, Wraith's Screech, and Orbital Piano. Get an invisibility item. This will make assassinating people so easy. It is advised you also use some sort of item to immobilize your enemy such as the Earth Orb, as it causes your enemy to sit down each time they are shocked preventing them from running away (too quickly) or the Heartbreaker Sword which cuts their arms off stopping them from using weapons."
