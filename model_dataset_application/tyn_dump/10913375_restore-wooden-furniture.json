Dip a clean cloth in the solution, wring out the excess water so it isn\u2019t dripping, and wipe down the whole piece of furniture to clean it. This is the safest way to clean furniture when you just want to rejuvenate it and keep the old finish. Other chemical solutions can damage the finish. You should be able to find wood soap at home improvement or furniture stores. If you can\u2019t, then you can make a safe solution with 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of mild dish soap and 1 gallon (3.78 L) of water. Wet a cloth in the solution, wipe off dirt and grime from the furniture, then dry it off with a clean towel."

          "description":"Rub petroleum jelly into the white rings and watermark spots left by glasses or spilled liquids over the years. Let it sit overnight so it will soak into the finish to remove or hide the watermarks, then wipe it off with a rag or paper towels. If the petroleum jelly doesn\u2019t work, you can try some specialty products designed for removing rings. Make sure to test them on a small spot first because they can change the color of the finish."

          "description":"Choose an epoxy putty or furniture wax repair stick that closely matches the color of the wood\u2019s finish. Break off a chunk of the putty or wax and shape it with your fingers to fit in the chips and cracks. Do your best to make the putty or wax flush with the surface of the furniture. You can get both epoxy putty and furniture repair wax sticks at home centers and furniture stores. Wax works best for smaller damages, while epoxy can fill bigger spaces. Note that the epoxy putty will require you to mix 2 parts together. Follow the instructions on the putty packaging to mix the parts together. Don\u2019t worry if the color doesn\u2019t match the finish exactly. You can cover it up with a wipe-on stain and finish later to make your repairs even less visible."

You don\u2019t need to strip off the old finish to restore the color of the furniture with gel stain. Another benefit of gel stain is that it doesn\u2019t dry super fast. If you don\u2019t like how it looks, you can remove it with mineral spirits and try a different color."

Use a standard all-purpose cleaner and a wet rag to wipe down all the wood as if you were cleaning a countertop. If the furniture isn\u2019t very dirty, then a wipe-down with a damp rag should work fine. You will be creating a mess as you refinish the furniture, so make sure to work in an easy-to-clean area, or put down drop sheets to catch dust and spills."

Sand with the grain until you remove all the existing finish; whether it\u2019s paint, varnish, or anything else. Sand until you expose all the bare wood. Make sure to check on your sanding paper as you go. Replace it with a fresh sheet when it gets worn down.
