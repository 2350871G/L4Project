          "description":"For example, if you\u2019re trying to paint stripes on a wall, you\u2019ll need to mark on the wall where you want them to be before attempting to paint them. Position the ruler where you want your line to be, then run the pencil along the ruler to mark it on the wall. Repeat this process, marking 12 inches (30 cm) at a time, until you\u2019ve marked off the entire length of the line you want to paint along. Use a bubble level as you go to make sure the lines you\u2019re drawing are perfectly straight. Place the level along the line; if the bubble goes to the center of the level, between the 2 black lines, your line is straight. If you\u2019re trying to paint along the line where your walls and ceiling meet, you can skip this step."
