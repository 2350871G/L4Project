          "description":"Stripping the rust and any remaining paint off cast iron will send paint and metal fragments into the air. Protect yourself by covering your eyes and wearing a respirator or similar facemask. Prevent cuts by wearing thick work gloves. Wearing long sleeves and pants will help as well. You might rub against a rough part of metal and cut yourself. Make sure you wear old clothes as well. Sanding and painting metal is a dirty job."

          "description":"Always take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Lay down a drop cloth in a well-ventilated area, preferably outdoors. Then lay the piece on top of the cloth so you don't make a mess while working. If you're working indoors, take steps to ventilate the area. Open all nearby windows as widely as you can. If you have one, use a window-mounted box fan to pull fumes out of the room. If you're in a garage, leave the door open while you work. If you\u2019re painting something that\u2019s fixed down like a railing, lay sheets and drop cloths around the whole work area to avoid making a mess."

          "description":"Any leftover paint and rust on the iron\u2019s surface will prevent new paint from adhering properly. Scrape back and forth several times with  in each spot  a scraper until loose pieces rub off. Don\u2019t miss any spots. If you leave paint or rust behind, the new coat of paint will flake off. The iron won\u2019t be entirely smooth after you scrape. This step removes flaking paint and rust. Subsequent steps will smooth out the surface. The noise from this scraping might be unpleasant. If you get the \u201cnails on a chalkboard\u201d feeling from scraping the iron, try wearing earplugs to help with the noise. If you're working on a new piece of iron without any rust or paint, then just clean the entire surface with mineral spirits before painting."

For curved portions, take a wire brush and use the same motions you used with the scraper. Scrub it until loose rust and paint come off. Be thorough when scrubbing hard to reach areas. If you miss any spots, your new paint won\u2019t stick properly. If you\u2019ve scrubbed with a scraper and a wire brush and the rust still won\u2019t come off, try using a powered grinder to strip any remaining rust."

          "description":"With the extra paint and outer rust layers gone, you can now smooth the iron\u2019s surface. Sand the entire piece with 150-grit sandpaper. Make sure you get inside any curves or shapes in the iron so the whole surface is smooth. Keep your goggles and gloves on because sanding can send small fragments of rust and metal into the air. For a piece of iron with a lot of curves, you may prefer a sanding sponge because it\u2019s more flexible. Use a medium grit and cover every surface of the iron the same as you would with sandpaper."

Re-wet the rag if you have to, especially if you\u2019re working on a large piece of iron. You don\u2019t have to rub hard. The rag should pick up any loose remnants without much scrubbing. A can of mineral spirits is available from any hardware store. It is also handy for cleaning your paint brushes and washing paint off your hands. Don\u2019t use water to clean dust off the metal.

This is especially important for outdoor metal because oil-based paint resists the elements much better. The two primary options for primer are roll-on and spray. Roll-on primer is applied with a roller and brush, just like paint. It takes longer to apply than spray primer, but it's easier to control and you don't risk making a mess if there is wind. Spray-on primer from a can is a faster option that you can use if you're shorter on time. Make sure you\u2019re in a well-ventilated area and wearing a mask whenever you use spray primer and paint. Also be careful applying spray primer outside if it's windy. A sudden gust could send paint everywhere. Whether you choose spray or roll-on primer, make sure it\u2019s designed for metal application. The product label should state this. Ask a hardware store employee for help if you can\u2019t find the right product."

Touch up areas you can\u2019t reach with a brush. If there are any curves or corners on the piece of metal, you probably won\u2019t be able to reach every spot with a roller. In this case, brush the primer onto these spots."

Continue spraying until the metal's whole surface is covered. Take extra steps to cover anything nearby with a sheet. Pay attention to the weather as well. If it's getting windy, take a break until the wind dies down. Remember to wear goggles and a mask when using spray primer."

Rolled-on primer should take at least 4. If it is humid out, each one will take longer. Monitor the primer to see when it dries. Lightly touch the surface to check if it\u2019s still sticky or wet.
