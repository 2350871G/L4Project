A front-loading washing machine might have more impact than a top loader because the tumbling action is what shrinks the fibers. If you don\u2019t have a front-loader at home, try one at your local laundromat. Wash your jeans inside out. It causes less wear on the jeans. This method doesn\u2019t work that well for preshrunk jeans or jeans that contain synthetic fibers. Alternatively, you could soak your jeans in a bucket of hot water. Dunk the jeans into the water.

    "Press the reverse sewing lever for just a moment when you start to secure your stitch.",
    "Continue stitching.",
    "Stitch in a smooth curve along the line of pins and markings that you added.",
    "In essence, you are creating a new seam.",
    "Try to keep your line straight as you work your way down.",
    "Aim to make the excess denim bigger as you get towards the bottom if you are making the flare smaller.",
    "Fasten off the thread.",
    "When you get to the very bottom, press the reverse sewing lever for just a moment to secure your stitch.",
    "After you\u2019ve fastened off your stitch, repeat the process on the other leg.",
    "Remove the pins.",
    "Replace them in their container.",
    "If you used many pins, double check to make sure you didn\u2019t miss any.",
    "Try on the jeans.",
    "Turn them right-side out.",
    "Inspect every seam for imperfections.",
    "Try walking, running, kneeling, and any other activity you might do in jeans.",
    "Finish the new seam.",
    "Turn the jeans inside out before you do this.",
    "Use sharp fabric scissors to cut off the excess.",
    "Leave an allowance of  about 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.3 to 1.9 cm) between the scissor blades and the new seam.",
    "Since denim frays, secure the new seam with a serger if you have one.",
    "If they appear lopsided or tight, rip out the seams and start over.",
    "If you notice bunching around the crotch, don't worry too much.",
    "This will settle down when worn and won\u2019t be noticeable for most jeans.",
    "Tightening the Waistband by Sewing Remove the center belt loop.",
    "Carefully use sharp fabric scissors to cut it from the center rear of your jeans.",
    "Set it aside and hang on to it.",
    "You\u2019ll need to replace it when you\u2019ve finished with the alterations.",
    "Draw the mid-mark.",
    "Draw a vertical line in the spot where the belt loop used to cover.",
    "Make the mark as straight as you can.",
    "Use a ruler or other straight edge if you like.",
    "Try on your jeans inside-out.",
    "Button or zip them up so they fall as they would when you'd wear them.",
    "Stand in front of a mirror.",
    "Make a note of how much fabric you need to remove.",
    "Pinch the fabric together at the back of the waist.",
    "Make sure you\u2019ve left enough room to breathe.",
    "Use the chalk or pencil to mark the edges you've gathered on the waistband.",
    "At this point, your marks don't have to be straight.",
    "Make sure they're visible enough for you to see and long enough to complete the process after you've taken the jeans off.",
    "Take off the jeans and measure the width to be removed.",
    "Unbutton or unzip them.",
    "Keep them inside-out.",
    "This will allow the outside to look professional after you're finished with the alterations.",
    "Measure half the width of the area to be removed from the mid-mark.",
    "Use the chalk/pencil to mark that location.",
    "Do the same on the other side.",
    "For example, if you need to remove 2 inches (5.1 cm), you\u2019ll place a mark at 1 inch (2.5 cm) to either side of the middle.",
    "Mark the wedge to be removed.",
    "Trace a wedge- (triangle-) shaped form starting at the top rear of the waistband.",
    "Its length should measure about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm).",
    "Connect it to the marks on either side of the mid-mark.",
    "Do this with either your tailor\u2019s chalk or pencil.",
    "The length of the wedge can be longer or shorter, depending on how much you need to alter.",
    "Rip out some stitches.",
    "This will be the area where the waistband meets the yoke (the area just below the waistband).",
    "Rip only about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to either side of the wedge.",
    "This makes the sewing process run more smoothly.",
    "Cut the waistband.",
    "Place your scissors at the mid-mark and snip the entire band in half.",
    "You\u2019ll probably cut through the label.",
    "Feel free to remove it if it\u2019ll get in your way.",
    "Rip the center seam.",
    "Use your seam ripper  for this step.",
    "Carefully remove the center stitches from the waist to the bottom of the wedge.",
    "When you reach the bottom of the wedge, tie off the remaining threads to prevent any more unraveling.",
    "Pin the new seam.",
    "Hold the ripped areas horizontally.",
    "Line up the wedge lines you made with the chalk.",
    "Use either safety pins or straight pins.",
    "Insert your pins horizontally so that you can easily remove them as you sew.",
    "As you pin, make sure the wedge lines and ripped edges continue to match up.",
    "Start at the crotch.",
    "Keep the jeans as flat as possible and completely together.",
    "Try an easy-to-remove basting stitch to test the fit first.",
    "Press the reverse sewing lever for just a moment when you start to secure your stitch.",
    "Continue stitching.",
    "Use the slowest setting on the machine, since you're working with a small area.",
    "Move the jeans from the crotch to the yoke.",
    "Remove the pins as you reach them.",
    "Fasten off the thread when you reach the yoke.",
    "Finish your new seam.",
    "Use fabric scissors to cut any excess from the edges.",
    "Give yourself an allowance of at least 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.3 to 1.9 cm).",
    "If you have a serger, secure the seam with that to prevent the denim from fraying.",
    "If you don't have a serger, use a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine.",
    "Look for asymmetry and secure the seam.",
    "Turn the seamed are right-side out.",
    "Make a note of which pocket is farther away from the center seam.",
    "Turn the jeans inside-out again.",
    "Go in the direction of the pocket that's farther away from the center.",
    "Pin it in place, if necessary.",
    "Iron the seam in this direction.",
    "Remove the pin(s).",
    "Add a second line of stitching.",
    "Turn the newly seamed area right-side out again.",
    "Feel the inside for the new seam.",
    "Place the edge of the seam under the needle of the sewing machine.",
    "This should be about 0.25 to 0.5 inches (0.64 to 1.27 cm).",
    "Start at the area just below the (still separated) waistband.",
    "Move toward the crotch.",
    "Fasten off the thread.",
    "Pin and finish the waistband.",
    "Twist each side of the waistband so that the right sides are facing each other.",
    "Pin them on the marks you made to either side of the center.",
    "This will be where your new stitch will be.",
    "Place the waistband beneath the needle of the sewing machine.",
    "Start at the bottom of the waistband.",
    "Continue to the top.",
    "Remove the pins as you sew.",
    "Make sure the pinned area lines up with the center seam.",
    "If it doesn't, readjust your pins.",
    "If it does, pin the bottom of the waistband to the yoke.",
    "Reattach the belt loop.",
    "Line up the top seam on the belt loop with the top seam of the waistband.",
    "Pin them together.",
    "Do the same with the bottom.",
    "Place the top of the belt loop under the needle of the sewing machine.",
    "Stitch horizontally across the top.",
    "Do the same with the bottom.",
    "Remove the pins.",
    "Tightening the Waistband with Hot Water Boil the waistband.",
    "Pour boiling water into a laundry tub, sink, or bucket.",
    "Immerse only the waistband into the water using a large wooden spoon.",
    "Keep it in the water for 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "Remove the jeans from the hot water.",
    "Pull up from the legs or use the wooden spoon.",
    "If you're worried about burning your hands, wear rubber gloves.",
    "Dry the jeans.",
    "Wring the waistband in a towel.",
    "Throw them into the dryer.",
    "Use high heat and dry.",
