If your household has issues with hard water, you might want to wipe down your shower each week. If your shower screen doesn\u2019t have a lot of issues with limescale, consider wiping it down with limescale remover on a monthly or bimonthly basis. While limescale isn\u2019t harmful to your shower screen, it can make the surface look clouded."

Since these products can be pretty concentrated and abrasive to your skin, wear a pair of disposable cleaning gloves whenever you use a specialized limescale cleaner. Try spritzing the entire surface of your shower screen, focusing especially on areas that have a lot of build-up. You can find limescale removing products at most stores that sell cleaning supplies."

As you work, use the fuzzy, more abrasive side of the sponge to spread the  cleaning product all over the shower screen. Check the label on your sponge to see if it\u2019s safe to use on glass.
