          "headline":"Try on the jeans and mark the length you want them to be.",
          "description":"Put on your jeans and look in the mirror to figure out the point where you want them to stop. Once you decide on the length, make a mark with a piece of chalk or a fabric marker where you want the hem of your jeans to stop. For a modern cropped look, try hemming them so they hit right at your ankle bone. However, you can cut them to any length you like, from mid-calf capris to barely grazing the floor, depending on the length you started with. Keep in mind that unless you hem them, your jeans will fray somewhat after you cut them. If you plant to let them fray, you\u2019ll actually need to cut about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) below the mark, so you may want to take that into account when you\u2019re deciding on the length. If you are planning to hem the jeans, leave an extra 1 in (2.5 cm) of length for the seams."

          "description":"Lay the jeans flat in front of you, then use your chalk or fabric marker to draw a straight line just below the mark you made for the hem. By adding the extra length, the jeans will still be the length you want after they start to fray."

        {
          "headline":"Cut along the chalk line with sharp scissors.",
          "description":"Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors and slowly cut along one of the chalk lines you drew. Cut through one leg at a time, as trying to cut through both legs at once will make it harder to get a perfectly straight line. Do not attempt to use dull scissors to cut denim. You\u2019ll end up with a jagged, messy-looking hem. If you\u2019d like, after you cut the first leg, you can use the strip you removed as a template to ensure both legs are exactly the same length. Just line it up perfectly with the hem of the opposite leg, then cut along the top edge. If you\u2019re concerned it will slip, you can pin it into place before you cut."

          "description":"If you want to make your own step-up hem, lay the jeans flat again after you\u2019ve finished cutting them. Draw a line about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the new hem, only on the front side of each leg. Cut 1 in (2.5 cm) up each side seam, then carefully cut along the new line you marked. This look combines the chic look of cropped jeans in the front with a flattering long line in the back."

Folding the hem twice will give you a neater edge. However, if your sewing machine isn't made for heavy fabrics like denim, only fold the hem up once. You can use thread that blends into the jeans or you can opt for a contrasting color, like yellow thread."

If you need to take a little more off the length, repeat the process until you\u2019re happy with the new style. If you cut your jeans too short and you don\u2019t like how they look, consider making a pair of cutoffs instead!"

For super-frayed jeans, finish them in the dryer. If you don\u2019t want your jeans to fray, hand wash them as needed and hang them to dry. Use scissors to trim the white threads as they unravel."

Look for a pair of jeans that fit you well at the waist and butt, then becomes more relaxed through the thighs. Straight-leg jeans, boyfriend cuts, and boxy high-waisted styles work well for this. If you\u2019re in doubt, choose a pair of jeans that are about a size bigger than you normally wear. Jeans with little or no stretch will be more durable after you cut them."

Use a fabric marker or a piece of chalk and mark the length near the outside seam. If you want to cuff your jeans, leave about an extra 2 in (5.1 cm) of fabric at the ends. Since the shorts will fray, it's best to leave an extra \u20442 in (1.3 cm) or so on the length. Remember, it\u2019s always better to leave them longer than to cut them too short, since you can always cut more later if you need to.Tip: If you already have a pair of shorts that are the same rise and fit as your jeans, you can use them as a template instead.

Imagine a straight line starting from the mark you made on the outside seam and going all the way across the jeans to the inseam. Measure 1.5 in (3.8 cm) down from the end of that line and make a small mark there. Then, draw a diagonal line from the new mark up to the original mark you drew at the outside seam.

Then, use tweezers to pick out all of the blue threads that run vertically along the strip that\u2019s left in the middle between the slits. You\u2019ll be left with white, horizontal threads. To make a bigger hole, add more strips, the same width apart.

    "Take the jeans off and lay them flat, then look at the mark you just made.",
    "Imagine a straight line starting from the mark you made on the outside seam and going all the way across the jeans to the inseam.",
    "Measure 1.5 in (3.8 cm) down from the end of that line and make a small mark there.",
    "Then, draw a diagonal line from the new mark up to the original mark you drew at the outside seam.",
    "If you cut straight across your jeans, the end result will actually look uneven, and you could end up exposing a lot more skin than you meant to.",
    "Take off the jeans and carefully cut along one of the lines you marked.",
    "Use a sharp pair of scissors to carefully cut along the diagonal line you drew.",
    "Try to keep your line as straight as possible.",
    "Using very sharp scissors will help keep you from having to stop and restart, which can result in jagged cuts.",
    "Fold the jeans in half and cut the other leg to match.",
    "Once you\u2019ve cut the first side, fold the jeans vertically along the crotch.",
    "Smooth the denim out as much as you can, then carefully cut along the bottom edge of the shorter side.",
    "This should ensure that your pant's legs end up exactly the same length.",
    "Cut small slits in the leg if the shorts are tight across your thighs.",
    "If the pants you chose weren\u2019t baggy enough, you might notice that your new shorts seem tight in your thighs.",
    "If that happens, just make a \u20442\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) slit along the outside seam on each leg.",
    "This will help create more of a baggy, relaxed look.",
    "Fold the jeans up and iron them if you want them to have a cuff.",
    "If you don\u2019t want the frayed edge on your pants to show, turn up the hem twice, about 1 in (2.5 cm) each time.",
    "Press the shorts with an iron to help hold the cuff in place.",
    "For extra security, sew a single stitch through the outside edge of each cuff.",
    "Wash and dry to create a frayed hem.",
    "If you want a distressed, aged cutoff look, toss your new jean shorts into the washing machine, then put them in the dryer.",
    "If they\u2019re not frayed enough, wash and dry them one more time.",
    "The best way to get that lived-in look is to wear your shorts until they fray naturally!",
    "Distressing Your Jeans Put on your jeans and use chalk to mark the areas you want to distress.",
    "The best way to see exactly where your distressing should fall is to examine your jeans while you\u2019re wearing them.",
    "That way, you can see right where your knees hit, or the perfect spot for a big hole so you don\u2019t accidentally show more skin than you intended.",
    "Popular spots for distressing include the knees, thighs, and back pockets of jeans.",
    "Take off the jeans and put thick cardboard into the legs.",
    "Placing a thick piece of cardboard inside the legs of your jeans will keep you from cutting all the way through to the other side when you\u2019re distressing them.",
    "If you don\u2019t have any cardboard on hand, you could also use a rolled-up newspaper.",
    "Cut horizontal strips with a box cutter if you want to make a frayed hole.",
    "Many distressed jeans feature a square hole with white threads stretched across it.",
    "To make this, use a craft knife and carefully cut 2 strips, one on top of the other, about 2 in (5.1 cm) long and \u20442 in (1.3 cm) apart.",
    "Then, use tweezers to pick out all of the blue threads that run vertically along the strip that\u2019s left in the middle between the slits.",
    "You\u2019ll be left with white, horizontal threads.",
    "To make a bigger hole, add more strips, the same width apart.",
    "If you want the hole to look more natural, make the strips wider in the middle, then gradually shorter to the top and bottom, similar to the shape of a diamond.",
    "Rub sandpaper along the denim to get a soft, worn look.",
    "Sandpaper is a great way to instantly create authentic-looking aging on your jeans.",
    "Use a coarse sandpaper, like 36-grit, and rub vigorously over the area you want to distress.",
    "Try using sandpaper around the edges of some of your other distressing to make it look even more realistic!",
    "Use a disposable razor to distress thicker areas.",
    "If you want to distress the pockets, waistband, or zipper of your jeans, take a regular safety razor, like the kind you use for shaving.",
    "Scrape the razor back and forth over the denim until you get the distressed look you\u2019re going for.",
    "This will dull the razor blade, so don\u2019t attempt to use it for shaving after you\u2019re finished.",
    "Pick at an area with a safety pin to make a small hole.",
    "If you want to add a subtle distressed touch to your jeans, take a safety pin and work it into the fibers.",
    "Pick them away with the tip of the pin until you create a small hole.",
    "This is a great way to add a subtle detail near a pocket or the waistband, for instance."
