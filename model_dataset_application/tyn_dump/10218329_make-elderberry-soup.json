Then, add 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, 4 cloves, and a 2-in (5 cm) stick of cinnamon and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Turn the burner to high so it comes to a boil.

Refrigerate the leftover elderberry soup in an airtight container for up to 3 to 4 days. Making Chilled German Elderberry Soup Measure the elderberries and remove the stems. Get out 3 cups (435 g) of fresh elderberries or 1 cup (160 g) of dried elderberries. Place them in a fine mesh strainer and rinse them with water. Then pick off and discard the stems. Bring the water and elderberries to a boil. Put the prepared elderberries into a large stockpot and pour in 6 cups (1,400 ml) of water. Put the lid on the pot and turn the burner to high heat. You should see steam escape from under the lid once the water begins to boil. Ensure that the pot isn't made of aluminum or the metal will react with the elderberries. Lower the heat and simmer the covered elderberries for 45 minutes. Turn the burner down to low heat so the water bubbles gently. Keep the lid on the pot and simmer the elderberries until they become soft. Dried elderberries will probably need the full 45 minutes to become soft while fresh elderberries may be done after 40 minutes. Blend the elderberries. Turn off the burner and use an immersion blender to combine the elderberries with the water until the elderberries are completely smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can transfer the elderberries to a blender or large food processor. Strain the elderberry mixture through a fine mesh strainer. Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and push the elderberry mixture through it using the back of a spoon. The strainer will remove most of the seeds. Transfer the berries back to the pot and add 3/4 cup (150 g) of sugar. Pour the strained elderberries back into the stockpot and turn the burner to medium heat. Stir in the sugar until it dissolves. Keep the elderberries warm while you make the thickening cornstarch slurry. Mix the cornstarch with water and whisk it into the elderberries. Put 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (8 g) of cornstarch into a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of cold water. Stir until the cornstarch dissolves and then whisk it into the elderberries. Bring the elderberry soup to a boil and stir in the apples and lemon zest. Whisk the soup frequently as it begins to bubble and thicken. Then peel and dice 2 cups (235 g) of tart apples. Stir in the diced apples along with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (6 g) of grated lemon zest. Tart apples include Pink Lady apples, Granny Smith apples, and Honeycrisp apples. Simmer the soup for 5 minutes.
