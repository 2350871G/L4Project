Use a sharp knife to cut 3 \u00bd pounds (1.6 kg) of the protein you\u2019re using into approximately 2-inch cubes (5-cm) that you can easily thread on a skewer. When it comes to seafood, choose heartier fish, such as salmon, swordfish, or tuna. Shrimp also work well for kabobs. If you\u2019re a vegetarian, you can omit the protein or substitute tofu for any type of meat."

          "headline":"Marinate the protein for a few hours.",
          "description":"To ensure the most flavorful kabobs, you should create a marinade for the protein. Choose a marinade that complements the type of protein that you\u2019re using, and allow the meat sit in it for to 2 to 5 hours. A marinade doesn\u2019t really penetrate the meat or protein, so there\u2019s no need to marinate overnight. If you don\u2019t want to marinate the protein, you can simply season the protein on all sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Make a basic marinade by mixing 1 cup (237 ml) of vegetable oil, \u00be cup (177 ml) of soy sauce, \u00bd cup (118 ml) of lemon juice, \u00bc cup (59 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, \u00bc cup (62 g) of mustard, 2 garlic cloves, and freshly ground black pepper. You can also try a pineapple marinade, Jack Daniel\u2019s marinade, Coke marinade, or your personal favorite marinade recipe."

          "description":"To ensure that the kabobs cook evenly, pair your protein with veggies that have the same cooking time. Onions, bell peppers, zucchini, grape tomatoes, and yellow squash are good options with most proteins. Use 3 to 4 whole vegetables, depending on their size, and cut them into chunks that are the same size as your protein. You can also use fruit, such as pineapple, peaches, and mangoes, for your kabobs."

          "description":"To assemble the kabobs, you\u2019ll need some type of skewer. Metal skewers are reusable, but they can be difficult to clean and are often hot to the touch when they\u2019re done cooking. Wooden skewers are inexpensive so you can throw them away when you\u2019re done and not worry about cleanup. They are prone to charring, though. For a good sized portion, choose skewers that are about 12-inches (30-cm) long."

          "headline":"Soak wooden skewers for a half hour.",
          "description":"Because wooden skewers can burn easily, you should soak them in water before you cook your kabobs. Place the skewers in a shallow dish, and cover them with water. Allow them to sit for about 30 minutes."

          "headline":"Space the ingredients on the skewers.",

Thread the protein and vegetable pieces onto the skewers, pushing the items so they\u2019re close together without actually touching. Make sure there\u2019s some space at the end of the skewer to avoid overcrowding -- 2 -inches (5-cm) is usually enough. You can thread the protein and vegetables on the skewers however you like. Alternating them is usually the most common method. If you\u2019re not sure if the cooking time of the protein and veggies matches up, you\u2019re better off making separate kabobs for the protein and vegetables."

For a gas grill, you can just set the temperature gauge to medium-high for preheating.
