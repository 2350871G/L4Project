          "description":"You'll want a flat, sturdy surface to work on while etching. Beyond that, you might want to put down a drop cloth. This will prevent any dripped or spattered etching cream from damaging your work surface or the surrounding area. Then clean your glass with mild soap, rinse it with water, and air dry it. Bottles with resistant dirt or grime might need some rubbing alcohol and a good scrub. Afterwards, clean your glass with mild soap, rinse it with water, and air dry it. Glue left on your bottle may negatively affect the etching process. You may need to soak your bottle in hot soapy water overnight to break up and remove this. Fingerprints, oil, and dust can also hurt the outcome of your etching. While cleaning and afterward, you may want to wear glove to prevent new fingerprints."

While first getting the hang of etching, you may want to stick to simple designs and shapes. The area on the inside of the closed shapes will be the etched part of your bottle. Keep this in mind while drawing your designs. If you're not very artistic, you can use tracing paper, trace your design, and transfer it to your vinyl."

          "description":"Take your utility knife and very carefully cut only your design free from the vinyl. You should not cut the vinyl from the side, but should press your utility knife into the outer lines of your design to cut the inside parts away. At this point, you should have one large piece of vinyl with holes in it from where you cut out your design. The excess vinyl you cut free while cutting out your designs can be thrown away or reused later. Be careful when cutting your designs. It's easy to press too hard with your knife and cut into your work surface. For this reason, you may want to use a cutting mat."

Position the design on the glass, and press the vinyl in place. If you have a large piece of vinyl, you may have flaps sticking above or below the top and bottom of your bottle. These can be cut off. Try to remove bubbles in your vinyl at the boundaries of your design. These can create places the etching cream can sneak in, causing your design to be imprecise."

In most cases, a small amount of cream can be put into a plastic container or directly onto the glass. Then spread the cream over the glass uncovered by your vinyl with a paintbrush or sponge brush. As a general rule, whenever handling chemicals you should wear gloves and goggles to prevent irritation, sickness, or permanent injury. Some kinds of cream may be too strong and require a diluting agent, like distilled water, to be added. Always read and follow the directions of your etching cream. Chemicals can be very dangerous if not handled properly."

          "description":"If etching cream has special, post-application handling instructions, follow these carefully. Generally, you should be able to remove and neutralize cream by rinsing it away under running water, then allow the bottle to air dry. Depending on the etching cream, the ideal time you should leave the cream on the glass will vary. Consult your label for the best results, but for most creams, 15 minutes should be enough. If it is inconvenient to run your glass under running water, in many cases you can remove etching cream by wiping it away with a damp rag. Wear gloves when doing so. Leftover etching cream should be disposed in the way indicated on the label of your product. Often, this involves diluting the cream with plenty of water and rinsing it down the drain."

Now you can show off your etched glass water bottle to your friends! In some cases, the adhesive from your vinyl may have left glue behind on your bottle. This can often be removed with mild soap, warm water, and a scrub brush. Stubborn glue might require an overnight soak in soapy water before it comes loose."

Whatever material you choose as a resist, it should be sturdy and able to stand up to sandblasting without peeling away. Two common kinds of resist that you might use in your abrasive etching include sturdy varieties of contact paper and strong vinyl adhesive tapes/sheeting.

While blasting, surrounding objects may be effected, so make sure all unnecessary equipment and items are moved away and/or covered with a drop cloth. Then clean your bottle with mild soap, water, and air dry it. The process of abrasive etching erodes the outer layer of the glass with tiny particles of sand sprayed at high speeds. Because this is a physical process, you don't need to worry as much about fingerprints as you would with chemical etching."

Make sure that:\nYour gloves are without holes and fit your hands well. Gloves that don't fit well may make it difficult to operate your sandblaster. Your respirator is comfortable and properly fastened, with no spaces between it and your face. Your goggles are comfortably, firmly attached to your head and allow you unobstructed visibility."

Generally, the longer you sandblast, the more etched the glass will become, though sandblasting too much may cause the glass to weaken or break. When using a clamp to hold your bottle in place, keep in mind that the parts of your glass covered by the clamp will not be etched. If a sand blasting cabinet or clamp are inconvenient, you could use objects you don't mind blasting with sand, like cinder blocks or a cement wall, to support your bottle. Avoid holding your sandblaster on an angle while blasting. Working on an angle has a much greater chance of lifting the resist and spoiling your design. There are many different kinds of sandblaster. Always follow the directions on your equipment for the best results, and avoid holding the blaster too close to the glass."

The three most common resists when etching glass are adhesive vinyl, bitumen, and wax. Of these three resists:\n\nAdhesive vinyl is best suited for creating sharp lines and shapes. You can easily use this resist to create linear and precise designs. Bitumen is generally sponged or painted onto the surface of your glass. It creates an etched effect that has a painted appearance. Wax allows some of the acid to creep under its edges. This creates soft, free lines in your etching. A wax mixture you might try on your own: combine equal parts beeswax, tallow, and paraffin wax."

Then, you'll need to clean your water bottle. Dirt, grime, and oil on the surface of your bottle can hurt the end result of your etching. For light to moderately dirty bottles, simply rinse it in warm water with a mild soap. Then wipe off excess moisture with a clean rag or paper towel and allow it to air dry. Dirty bottles might first need to be doused and wiped with rubbing alcohol. Then rinse the glass with mild soap and warm water and allow it to air dry.

          "description":"Depending on the kind of resist, your method of application will vary. Wherever you apply your resist will not be etched by the acid you'll be putting on your glass. In this way, you can form designs by leaving gaps in your resist application to form etched shapes, designs, and patterns. You can draw or trace and transfer closed shaped designs on adhesive vinyl beforehand. Then, cut these out with a utility knife to create gaps in the vinyl where the acid will etch, pull free the adhesive backing, and apply the vinyl. Wax can sometimes harden very quickly when it comes in contact with your glass. You can give yourself more time to work with the wax by warming your glass first, like you could under a lightbox, for example."

To make your own dibbler, all you need to do is tie clean cotton wool to a bamboo skewer firmly. In some cases, your acid may have come with an applicator. Feel free to use this in place of a dibbler. You may be able to create a sufficient dibbler by folding your cotton wool in half and skewering it on the pointed end of your bamboo skewer."

However, hydrofluoric acid can be neutralized with a magnesium hydroxide heavily diluted with distilled water. Never attempt to neutralize hydrofluoric acid with potassium carbonate (soda ash), potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide. These create a dangerous reaction with hydrofluoric acid. Magnesium hydroxide can be found in many over the counter supplements at your local pharmacy or drug store."

Always follow the usage directions that came with your acid, but generally you can expect an ideal hydrofluoric acid solution for etching to be in a 3:1 ratio. This means for every three parts acid, you add one part distilled water. For example, since you're only etching a water bottle, it isn't likely you'll need much solution. In this case, you might only use 1 cup of acid diluted with 1/3 cup distilled water. Prioritize plastic containers that are sturdy and safe to use with your acid. Otherwise, the corrosive effect of the acid may eat through the container."

Lower your dibbler into the acid until the cotton wool is submerged. Then:\nRemove the dibbler and allow excess acid to drip back into the acid filled container. When the dripping ceases, apply a thin film of acid to the glass with the dibbler. Reinsert your dibbler into the acid as necessary and cover all surfaces on your bottle that don't have a resist coating."

Alternatively, you could use a brush to paint liberal amounts of neutralizer onto where you've applied acid to your glass, or you could dribble neutralizer onto your bottle with a spoon or ladle. Once the acid on your bottle has been neutralized, rinse the bottle with water and allow it to air dry. The acid will begin etching immediately after its application. Waiting only a short time will result in light etching, longer wait times in prominent etching."

Dirty bottles might first need to be doused and wiped with rubbing alcohol. Then rinse the glass with mild soap and warm water and allow it to air dry. To prevent accidentally leaving behind fingerprints after cleaning your bottle, you may want to wear your gloves from this point on. Apply your resist. Depending on the kind of resist, your method of application will vary. Wherever you apply your resist will not be etched by the acid you'll be putting on your glass. In this way, you can form designs by leaving gaps in your resist application to form etched shapes, designs, and patterns. You can draw or trace and transfer closed shaped designs on adhesive vinyl beforehand. Then, cut these out with a utility knife to create gaps in the vinyl where the acid will etch, pull free the adhesive backing, and apply the vinyl. Wax can sometimes harden very quickly when it comes in contact with your glass. You can give yourself more time to work with the wax by warming your glass first, like you could under a lightbox, for example. Create a dibbler, if necessary. A dibbler is a kind of applicator that you can use to put your acid onto your glass water bottle. To make your own dibbler, all you need to do is tie clean cotton wool to a bamboo skewer firmly. In some cases, your acid may have come with an applicator. Feel free to use this in place of a dibbler. You may be able to create a sufficient dibbler by folding your cotton wool in half and skewering it on the pointed end of your bamboo skewer. Mix your neutralizing solution. Acid can be very dangerous, so you should always use extreme caution when handling it. However, hydrofluoric acid can be neutralized with a magnesium hydroxide heavily diluted with distilled water. Never attempt to neutralize hydrofluoric acid with potassium carbonate (soda ash), potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide. These create a dangerous reaction with hydrofluoric acid. Magnesium hydroxide can be found in many over the counter supplements at your local pharmacy or drug store. Prepare your acid in a container under a fume hood. Whenever handling acid, be sure you wear rubber gloves, an apron, and goggles. Always follow the usage directions that came with your acid, but generally you can expect an ideal hydrofluoric acid solution for etching to be in a 3:1 ratio. This means for every three parts acid, you add one part distilled water. For example, since you're only etching a water bottle, it isn't likely you'll need much solution. In this case, you might only use 1 cup of acid diluted with 1/3 cup distilled water. Prioritize plastic containers that are sturdy and safe to use with your acid. Otherwise, the corrosive effect of the acid may eat through the container. Transfer the acid to your glass. With your hands still gloved, eyes goggled, and while under the fume hood, take your dibbler by the end opposite the one that has the cotton wool attached. Lower your dibbler into the acid until the cotton wool is submerged. Then:\nRemove the dibbler and allow excess acid to drip back into the acid filled container. When the dripping ceases, apply a thin film of acid to the glass with the dibbler. Reinsert your dibbler into the acid as necessary and cover all surfaces on your bottle that don't have a resist coating. Neutralize your acid. After waiting some time, take your bottle and dip it in your neutralizing solution. Alternatively, you could use a brush to paint liberal amounts of neutralizer onto where you've applied acid to your glass, or you could dribble neutralizer onto your bottle with a spoon or ladle. Once the acid on your bottle has been neutralized, rinse the bottle with water and allow it to air dry. The acid will begin etching immediately after its application. Waiting only a short time will result in light etching, longer wait times in prominent etching. Dispose of your acid. Generally, the company you bought your hydrofluoric acid from will also indicate the best disposal practices for your region. Generally, all used/wasted hydrofluoric acid should be:\nPlaced in a chemically compatible container that won't be eaten away by the acid over time. It should be clearly labeled with a Hazardous Waste tag. Taken to an approved, local hazardous waste disposal site. These can often be found with an online keyword search for, \"hazardous waste disposal near me.\"",

    "Take the adhesive vinyl with the designs cut from it and pull free the adhesive backing.",
    "Position the design on the glass, and press the vinyl in place.",
    "If you have a large piece of vinyl, you may have flaps sticking above or below the top and bottom of your bottle.",
    "These can be cut off.",
    "Try to remove bubbles in your vinyl at the boundaries of your design.",
    "These can create places the etching cream can sneak in, causing your design to be imprecise.",
    "Mix your etching cream, if necessary, and apply it.",
    "Depending on the kind of cream you purchased, the usage instructions will vary.",
    "In most cases, a small amount of cream can be put into a plastic container or directly onto the glass.",
    "Then spread the cream over the glass uncovered by your vinyl with a paintbrush or sponge brush.",
    "As a general rule, whenever handling chemicals you should wear gloves and goggles to prevent irritation, sickness, or permanent injury.",
    "Some kinds of cream may be too strong and require a diluting agent, like distilled water, to be added.",
    "Always read and follow the directions of your etching cream.",
    "Chemicals can be very dangerous if not handled properly.",
    "Remove the cream and allow the glass to air dry.",

    "In some cases, the adhesive from your vinyl may have left glue behind on your bottle.",
    "This can often be removed with mild soap, warm water, and a scrub brush.",
    "Stubborn glue might require an overnight soak in soapy water before it comes loose.",
    "Etching with Abrasive Blasting Select your resist.",
    "The resist is a cover that will protect part of your glass bottle while uncovered parts get etched by a sandblaster.",
    "Whatever material you choose as a resist, it should be sturdy and able to stand up to sandblasting without peeling away.",
    "Two common kinds of resist that you might use in your abrasive etching include sturdy varieties of contact paper and strong vinyl adhesive tapes/sheeting.",
    "The key requirement when choosing a resist for sandblasting is a strong adhesive.",
    "If your resist peels away while blasting, your design will be ruined.",
    "Gather your other abrasive etching materials.",
    "In addition to your resist, you'll also need a handheld sandblaster and some safety gear.",
    "Sandblasting releases small bits of sand at a high speed to wear away surfaces quickly.",
    "This can cause irritation or damage to the skin, lungs, and eyes without the proper equipment.",
    "You'll need:\nClamps (optional)\nDrop cloth\nGloves\nGoogles\nPen or pencil\nRespirator mask\nSandblaster/glass etcher Prepare your work area and glass.",
    "You should only operate your sandblaster in a well ventilated, wide open area or sandblasting cabinet.",
    "While blasting, surrounding objects may be effected, so make sure all unnecessary equipment and items are moved away and/or covered with a drop cloth.",
    "Then clean your bottle with mild soap, water, and air dry it.",
    "The process of abrasive etching erodes the outer layer of the glass with tiny particles of sand sprayed at high speeds.",
    "Because this is a physical process, you don't need to worry as much about fingerprints as you would with chemical etching.",
    "Make a stencil of your design on your resist.",
    "Take a suitable pen or pencil and draw your design on on your resist.",
    "Be sure that all parts of your design form closed shapes.",
    "Simple designs might be the best option for beginners.",
    "Holding your vinyl up to your glass can give you a better idea of the best size and placement for your design on the resist.",
    "If you aren't very artistic, you can copy a professional looking design with some tracing paper and transfer that to your resist.",
    "Cut your design free.",
    "Take your utility knife and press it into the outer lines that you drew on your resist to cut away the inner parts of your design.",
    "Avoid cutting from the edges, as this can create gaps where the sandblasting etches the glass where you had not intended.",
    "Exercise caution when cutting.",
    "Your utility knife might press through the resist and make cuts in your work surface.",
    "To prevent this, you can use a cutting mat.",
    "At this point, your resist should be in one piece, with holes where you've cut free your design.",
    "Unused pieces of your resist can be thrown away, though you may be able to reuse these in other projects.",
    "Adhere your resist to your glass.",
    "Depending on the kind of resist you've chosen, this process may vary.",
    "In many cases, your resist can be applied by removing its adhesive backing and applying it to your water bottle.",
    "Smooth bubbles and irregularities in your resist especially around its edges.",
    "These areas are susceptible to being pulled loose during abrasive etching.",
    "Check safety equipment before etching.",
    "Proper safety equipment is a must when abrasive etching.",
    "Little bits of sand or glass can get in your eyes or lungs, causing serious discomfort or permanent injury.",
    "Make sure that:\nYour gloves are without holes and fit your hands well.",
    "Gloves that don't fit well may make it difficult to operate your sandblaster.",
    "Your respirator is comfortable and properly fastened, with no spaces between it and your face.",
    "Your goggles are comfortably, firmly attached to your head and allow you unobstructed visibility.",
    "Sandblast until the design is sufficiently etched.",
    "Depending on the weight of your water bottle and the power of your sandblaster, you may need to clamp it in place or use a sandblasting cabinet.",
    "Generally, the longer you sandblast, the more etched the glass will become, though sandblasting too much may cause the glass to weaken or break.",
    "When using a clamp to hold your bottle in place, keep in mind that the parts of your glass covered by the clamp will not be etched.",
    "If a sand blasting cabinet or clamp are inconvenient, you could use objects you don't mind blasting with sand, like cinder blocks or a cement wall, to support your bottle.",
    "Avoid holding your sandblaster on an angle while blasting.",
    "Working on an angle has a much greater chance of lifting the resist and spoiling your design.",
    "There are many different kinds of sandblaster.",
    "Always follow the directions on your equipment for the best results, and avoid holding the blaster too close to the glass.",
    "Clean the bottle.",
    "Glass dust and sand will be on the surface of your bottle, so you should handle it with gloves until you've rinsed it thoroughly under warm water.",
    "If there isn't a suitable faucet around, thoroughly wipe the glass with a clean, damp cotton rag.",
    "Glass dust and sand can build up on your rag when wiping it clean.",
    "As your rag dirties, switch to a clean part and continue until the whole glass has been wiped.",
    "Remove the resist and enjoy your etched bottle.",
    "Since the adhesive of most abrasive resists needs to be strong to stand up to blasting, you may have some difficulty removing it.",
    "A brief soak in soapy water can loosen this adhesive.",
    "Then pull the resist free and enjoy your handiwork.",
    "In some cases, you may be able to use the tip of your utility knife to lift a corner of the resist and pull the rest free.",
    "Etching Glass with Acid Gather your acid etching supplies.",
    "You're going to be applying what artists call a resist to the surface of your glass bottle.",
    "A resist is covering that will prevent the acid from etching your glass, so by applying it to your bottle artistically, you can form patterns of etched glass in the places you didn't use your resist.",
    "In all, you'll need:\nApron\nBamboo skewer\nClean rag (or paper towel)\nCotton wool\nDistilled water\nGlass water bottle\nHydrofluoric acid\nMagnesium hydroxide\nPlastic container (x2; thick, sturdy plastic preferred)\nProtective goggles\nResist (wax, adhesive vinyl, or bitumen)\nRubber gloves\nTongs\nUtility or craft knife\nDepending on your country and local laws, hydrofluoric acid may only be available from specialized chemical companies.",
    "This substance can be very dangerous if improperly handled.",
    "Determine your ideal resist.",
    "There are many different kinds of resist you can use in your acid etching, and each will yield a different effect.",
    "The three most common resists when etching glass are adhesive vinyl, bitumen, and wax.",
    "Of these three resists:\n\nAdhesive vinyl is best suited for creating sharp lines and shapes.",
    "You can easily use this resist to create linear and precise designs.",
    "Bitumen is generally sponged or painted onto the surface of your glass.",
    "It creates an etched effect that has a painted appearance.",
    "Wax allows some of the acid to creep under its edges.",
    "This creates soft, free lines in your etching.",
    "A wax mixture you might try on your own: combine equal parts beeswax, tallow, and paraffin wax.",
    "Prepare your work area and bottle.",
    "Choose a flat, level, sturdy work surface equipped with a fume hood.",
    "Hydrofluoric acid is very dangerous, and should be treated with extreme caution.",
    "Then, you'll need to clean your water bottle.",
    "Dirt, grime, and oil on the surface of your bottle can hurt the end result of your etching.",
    "For light to moderately dirty bottles, simply rinse it in warm water with a mild soap.",
    "Then wipe off excess moisture with a clean rag or paper towel and allow it to air dry.",
    "Dirty bottles might first need to be doused and wiped with rubbing alcohol.",
