Choose one that already has 2 wires attached to it so you don\u2019t have to use your own. Position the end of the lightbulb inside the socket and rotate it clockwise to secure it to the base. Make sure the socket base is made to use with 100-watt lightbulbs. If the power rating is too strong or weak, then the test may not work."
