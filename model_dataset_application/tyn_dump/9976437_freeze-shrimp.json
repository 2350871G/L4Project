Avoid leaving cooked shrimp out on the counter for more than 2 hours. If you don't have time to shell all the shrimp at once, put them in the fridge between breaks. You can also remove the large vein along the shrimp's back if you prefer, but it's not necessary for freezing."

This is separate from cooking the shrimp and is done when you're ready to freeze it, as boiling cooked shrimp takes care of harmful bacteria."

This will prevent the cooked shrimp from clumping together, as cooked shrimp is best preserved separately. Freeze the shrimp within 1-2 days after boiling them to keep them from spoiling.
