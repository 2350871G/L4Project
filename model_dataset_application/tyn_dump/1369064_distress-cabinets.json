Let the glaze dry for the time specified by the manufacturer's directions. If you want a crackly look, use a crackle glaze instead. For large, wide cracks, apply a thick coat. For finer, more spidery cracks, apply a thinner coat. Once the cabinet is covered in glaze, you can smooth out the circular marks with a clean rag.

Check the label to make sure yours is non-yellowing. Some sealers need a curing period as well. This can take several hours to a few days. Do not get impatient or try to rush through.
