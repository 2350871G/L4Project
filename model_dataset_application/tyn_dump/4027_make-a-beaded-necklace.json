Make sure to have all of your materials at hand: beads, beading thread, wire cutter, crimp beads, super glue, and closures to properly finish your necklace. The best kinds of wire are flexible beading wire and beading thread. All of these materials are easily available at your local craft store (Michael's or Joanne's, for example). Determine your necklace style. When considering which style of necklace you'd like to create, think about factors such as length.

Play with the beads until you find the design you like best. Try different color variations, perhaps even think of having multiple layers of string. You might want a choker that wraps around your neck a few times, or maybe just one long loop. Place your bead board on your flat surface. A bead board is a tool that greatly facilitates the process of stringing beads, and improves your design skills rapidly. You can use it to measure the length of your necklace, while keeping the beads in place. If you plan on making necklaces regularly, or even occasionally, you should have a board at hand. Place your beads in your chosen design at the number zero, and measure the length of your necklace using the numbers and dashes along the sides. Use the channels for laying out beads. The tray insets are for holding beads and findings. Cut your determined length of beading thread, plus 6 inches. For example, if you'd like to make a choker, cut a total of 22 inches of thread (16 inches plus 6). Gather 2 crimp beads, 1 clasp, and the beads for the desired necklace. The next part will give you tips on how to thread beads properly. Making Your Beaded Necklace Slide one bead onto the string. Then, slide the crimping bead in, and then add another bead about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so down. Keep in mind that you're not yet transferring your design onto the thread. These are necessary, preliminary steps that will secure your necklace. Place one end of the clasp (the jump ring) on after the crimping bead. Then, make a loop with the stringing material. Thread the end of the stringing material through the clasp section. Then add the bead-crimp-bead combo, and use the crimping tool/chain nose pliers to crimp the bead into place. If using bead thread, you may wish to put a dot of super glue of hypo cement on either end to ensure that the beads and crimp stay on.) These steps will protect the stringing material from rubbing on the ends of the crimp bead, which may cause the necklace to break. Slide your design onto the string. Once you're satisfied with your design, carefully remove one bead at a time, and string it onto the thread. Be sure to leave about 3-4  inches (7.5-10 cm) of stringing material at the end.

If the stringing material is too tight the necklace will be rigid and this can make the design look angular instead of slightly rounded like a necklace should be. Crimp the second end and cut the stringing material with slush cutters. It is not recommended that you cut the wire too close to the crimp bead. 1 inch (2.5 cm) of wire, carefully hidden in the bead holes, is good insurance against breakage. Finished. ",
