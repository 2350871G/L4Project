To make your concrete stronger, increase the amount of cement that you\u2019re using in relation to the amount of sand and other aggregates that you\u2019re using. For example, if the concrete mixture\u2019s instructions typically call for 4 parts sand to 1 part water (i.e., 80% sand and 20% water) for most construction projects, go with 3 parts sand to 1 part water (75% sand and 25% water) instead to make your concrete more durable."

Add this admixture to your concrete during the mixing process, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. You can buy this admixture at any home improvement store.

Pour shrinkage-reducing admixture into your concrete, per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, to prevent cracking or curling caused by this water loss. You can purchase shrinking-reducing additives at any store that sells concrete mixtures. This type of admixture is best used in projects where concrete cracking has to be prevented for aesthetic reasons (e.g., public buildings)."

Chlorides also corrode steel, so adding a corrosion-inhibiting admixture to your concrete is an important step in reinforcing any concrete that is exposed to chlorides on a regular basis. Buildings that would benefit from concrete reinforced with this additive include highway bridges, marine facilities, parking garages, and any buildings that are in close proximity to seawater. Most home improvement stores will make this admixture available for purchase."

The chairs will keep the grid in place when you go to pour the concrete over it, while also making sure that the steel rebar is not located at the bottom of your concrete slab. For your concrete to be adequately reinforced, the rebar needs to be positioned closer to the center of your slab rather than the bottom of it. Use chairs that will position your rebar about in the middle of your slab. For example, if you plan to pour 4 inches (10 cm) of concrete, use chairs that are 2 inches (5.1 cm) high."

For example, if the length and width of your concrete forming is 12 by 12 inches (30 by 30 cm), then cut your wire mesh to be 8 by 8 inches (20 by 20 cm). You can buy steel mesh at most home improvement stores. If possible, buy steel mesh in a flat sheet instead of in a roll, since it can be a little difficult to unroll sometimes. If you need to use more than 1 sheet of steel mesh, have the sheets overlap by about 1 foot (0.30 m) and tie them together with wire rebar ties."
