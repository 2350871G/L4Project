The kit will have a holding tray, a number of peat pellets, labels, and a lid to create the greenhouse effect. This is a great way to grow bamboo seedlings all year round and in an indoor setting. The greenhouse that you purchase does not need to be specifically made for bamboo growing. Kits come in a variety of sizes from 6 plants up to over 70. A 50-plant greenhouse measures approximately 11 by 11 inches (28 by 28 cm). Your odds of success will improve if you choose a greenhouse with space for 50+ plants. After you buy your greenhouse, you'll notice that each pellet is already positioned in its own indention. This means that the greenhouse is ready for planting with almost no setup required."

You'll need to adjust the amount of water that you use depending on how many pellets you need to cover. It's okay if the tops of the pellets get wet during the pouring process, as long as they are halfway covered. Check any diagrams and instructions on the greenhouse package before watering or planting. Some greenhouse kits even come with self-watering setups. You might need to fill a large basin with water. Then, the basin will feed into a watering mat under the pellets, reducing your watering intervals. Another option is to remove the pellets and place them into a rectangular metal cake pan. Then, pour boiling water over the pellets until it reaches the halfway point. The high temperature of the water is supposed to help sterilize the pellets. The ideal water temperature for watering your pellets is 10 to 15 \u00b0C (50 to 59 \u00b0F). You can also use distilled water for your seedlings to minimize any contaminants."
