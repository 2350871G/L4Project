    "Don't worry about breaking apart the lemons.",
    "It's more important to pack them tightly than to keep them whole.",
    "Fill any empty space with fresh lemon juice.",
    "As you pack the lemons, they will release their juice.",
    "This juice should fill up most of the extra space in the jar.",
    "However, there may be some space at the top that is just air.",
    "Add fresh juice until there is only a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) gap at the top of the jar.",
    "Create the extra juice by juicing some additional lemons.",
    "It's most important that all of the lemon rinds are totally submerged in lemon juice.",
    "Let the jar sit at room temperature for 3 to 4 weeks.",
    "Once the jar is packed, seal it with the lid.",
    "Then, every day or so, shake the jar to ensure that the salt is evenly distributed and that all of the lemons are getting pickled.",
    "You will know the preserved lemons are done when the white parts of the rinds have turned clear, which usually takes several weeks.",
    "When the whites of the rinds have become clear, this means they have become soft, pliable, and ready to add to your favorite dish.Tip: After the lemons are done, put the jar straight into the refrigerator and use the pickles within a year."
