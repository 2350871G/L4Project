EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\t...Sam Bogue, a sommelier, says: \"Start by looking at the wine. Pay attention to the color, and whether it's transparent or opaque. Then, I like to smell the wine, then swirl it in the glass, then smell it again. I think you get a little bit of a different aroma before you aerate the wine. Try to think about what fruits, spices, or herbs the smell reminds you of.\""

When a wine has \u201clegs,\u201d that means it sticks to the side of the glass and contains lots of fruit juice. The darker and deeper the color of a wine, the bolder the taste should be."

This will cause the tastes from the wine to change, sometimes quite suddenly and sharply. Tasting notes are the individual flavors you can pick out of the overall experience of a certain wine.
