You may not need all 12 jars, especially if you are using larger jars, like pints, but it is much easier to prepare too many than too few.

If you're using raspberries or blueberries, you don't need to cut them, but if you're using apricots or strawberries or other fruit larger than berries, then you should cut them into 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) chunks; each strawberry should be cut in half or even quartered, for example."

You don't have to go crazy with this -- the fruit will naturally soften and will become more malleable as you boil it. How long you spend crushing the fruit depends on what kind of jam you'd like -- if you'd like thicker jam with larger chunks of fruit, crush the fruit for 1-2 minutes; for smoother jam, go for 3 minutes."

Sterilize a dozen canning jars. You can't use any old jars -- you'll need to get jars that are specifically meant for canning. To do this, boil the jars in water for 10 minutes.
