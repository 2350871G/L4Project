Mixing the Potato and Onion Filling Peel and cut the potatoes. Wash 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of Russet potatoes. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the potatoes.

Add them to the pan and stir them. Stir and saute the shallots for a few minutes and then remove them from heat. The shallots should soften and become translucent. Keep an eye on them since shallots can burn quickly. Drain the cottage cheese. Place a few layers of cheesecloth into a fine mesh strainer. Set the strainer over a sink.

Scoop the sauteed shallots into the bowl with the drained cottage cheese. Add the remaining filling ingredients and stir the filling mixture until it's combined. You'll need:\n1 egg\n1 teaspoon low sodium salt\n1/8 teaspoon ground pepper\n2 tablespoons low-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche Assembling the Knishes Preheat the oven and prepare a baking sheet. Turn the oven on to 375 \u00b0F (190 \u00b0C). This will ensure that the oven is ready to use once you've rolled and filled the knishes. Get out a large baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper over it. Set the sheet aside while you roll the dough. Divide the dough and roll it into a square. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl with the dough and place the dough on your work surface. Cut the dough in half to get two equal pieces. Set one piece aside. Sprinkle your work surface with some flour and put the other piece of dough on it. Roll the dough into a thin square that's about 12 inches (30 cm) in size. You'll need to roll the other piece of dough into a square too. Sprinkle more flour on your work surface if the dough begins to stick. Spread filling on the dough and roll it into a log. Take your filling and divide it into two portions (one for each square of dough). Shape one portion of filling into a 2-inch (5 cm) long and place it across the bottom of the dough. Fold the dough over the filling and roll it up to the end. Roll and fill the other portion of dough and filling. Avoid rolling the dough too tightly or it may split as it bakes. If you'd like to make two different kinds of knishes, make a half batch of each type of filling. Use one filling on each of the squares of dough. Trim the ends and twist the dough. Use a knife or bench scraper to trim off the ends of each log of filled dough. These ends are the parts that don't contain any of the fillings. Use your finger to press indentations on the log at 3 inches (7.5 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm) across. Twist the dough at these points. Twisting the dough will seal off individual knishes (kind of like how sausage links are strung together). Cut and seal each knish. Cut the dough at the twisted points so you end up with 3 segments for each log. Pinch the ends of one segment together to make a sealed bottom of one knish. Press the knish with the palm of your hand to flatten it a little. If you want, you can pinch the top ends like you did on the bottom or you can loosely fold them over the dough so they're slightly open. If you're using different fillings for half of your knishes, consider sealing the tops differently so you can tell them apart. Baking the Knishes Place the knishes on the baking sheet. Get out the baking sheet that you lined with parchment paper. Set the six knishes on the paper and ensure that they aren't touching one another. If your knishes are large and your baking pan is small, consider using two small baking sheets. Brush the knishes with an egg wash. Place 1 large egg yolk into a prep bowl and add 1 teaspoon of water. Whisk the egg yolk and water together until they're combined. Dip a pastry brush into the egg wash and brush it over the knishes on the baking sheet. The egg wash will make the knishes turn golden brown as they bake. It will also make them slightly glossy. Bake the knishes. Put the knishes in the preheated oven and bake them for 45 minutes. Check the knishes halfway through baking to ensure that they're baking evenly.
