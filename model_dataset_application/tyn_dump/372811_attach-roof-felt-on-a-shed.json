          "description":"Start by measuring the length and width of one side of the roof in inches. Afterward, multiply them to calculate the area. For example, if its length is 120 inches (10 ft) and its width is 240 inches (20 ft), the area is 28,800 square inches (200 sq ft). Continue this for each surface of your roof. Afterward, add each surface area together for the total area of your roof to be covered in felt. Add about 2 inches (5 cm) to each of your measurements before calculating the area. This will give you extra felt to hang over the eaves of your roof."

However, you must allow for overlaps on joints. In most cases this will leave 400 square feet (37 m) of net coverage per 1 roll. Purchase an extra pack of felt in case you need more or end up damaging your first roll. Divide your area in square inches by 144 to get the area in square feet."

Lightly scratch a vertical line on the surface with the rear of the blade to mark the length of your shed plus the front and rear overlaps. Mark the same at the other end of the roll. Scratch a line between the two marks to create a vertical guide for your cut. Cut through the felt vertically, taking care to keep the path of your knife blade clear of any trailing limbs.For example, if the width of your shed is 240 inches (610 cm) plus 4 inches (10 cm) of overlap, mark a line 244 inches (620 cm) from the left width of your felt piece. Purchase a hooked blade\u2014which has a small hook extending from a standard blade\u2014from a home hardware store. You can also use a standard straight blade if you don't have a hooked blade. However, this will make cutting more difficult. Be sure the flat surface doesn\u2019t have anything sharp on it."

Continue loosening it until it comes off or it's loose enough to pull off with your hands. Install another base sheet of the same material. Be sure to use the same nails to fix it to the wooden beams underneath. Apply waterproof paint or primer to promote felt attachment. Use a 4 inch (10 cm) paintbrush or a roller to apply the paint or primer. Drag it gently from one end of the roof to the other (east to west or west to east). Begin at the bottom, working in horizontal lines and gradually moving upward.If you use paint, be sure to choose high-quality water-based enamel acrylic brands with rust-inhibiting properties. Select general purpose felt primer with low viscosity. Attaching Your Roof Felt Start rolling the first layer of felt out from the bottom of one side of the roof.

As you roll it out, make sure that it remains flat. For hip-type shed roofs\u2014which include slopes on all 4 sides\u2014begin at the square hip at the top of the roof.

Hang the lower edge of the felt over the eave\u2014the part of the roof that meets or overhangs the shed's walls\u2014by about 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.3 to 1.9 cm). Tack the felt onto the initial rolling spot using a tack gun. Return to the side that you began rolling from and apply 3 tacks vertically using a tacking gun. To load the gun, turn the front dial 180 degrees and insert a needle by lining up the long groove of the needle with the groove on the tack gun. Press the needle into place and then turn the lever back around. Keep each tack about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the edge of the roof. Continue pulling the felt tight from the untacked end. With one side tacked to the roof, pull the opposite end tightly and hold it to the ground, making sure it lies flat on the roof surface. Take care not to rip the felt as you pull it. Roll a new row of felt into the opposite direction as the first. If you rolled the first row from west to east, the new row should be east to west. Allow about 4 inches (10 cm) of overlap between the bottom of the second row and the top of the first layer. Apply each row in a perfectly parallel manner. Most roof felt pieces have guidelines stenciled into them to ensure you apply them in straight, parallel lines. Continue rolling new felt rows until you are close to the roof's peak. Once you get close to the top, add another layer of felt so that you overlap the ridge of your roof by about 1 foot (0.30 m). Afterward, apply the felt in the same manner on the opposite side. Nail the felt in using 0.59 inch (15 mm) galvanized clout nails. Grip the hammer tightly by the end of the handle and hold your thumb at the top of the shaft. Start at one of the upper corners of the felt and continue along the perimeter. Space each nail apart by about 30 to 36 inches (76 to 91 cm) along the side of the felt closest to the roof's peak and 12 inch (30.5 cm) along the side closest to the ground.
