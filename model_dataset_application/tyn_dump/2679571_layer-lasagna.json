          "headline":"Get the right kind of dish.",
          "description":"For the layering effect of your lasagna to work, you'll need a deep, wide dish. You can use either a glass or metal dish. Pick the dish that is deepest and wide enough for the size of the lasagna you need to make. A deep dish will require longer to cook than a shallow one. Glass is a poor conductor of heat, but it also distributes heat more evenly. Using a glass dish will help your lasagna cook more evenly and stay warm if you need to wait for someone to get home before serving dinner. Metals, especially aluminum, are generally better at conducting heat. They heat up quickly, but also can lose the heat quickly once removed from the oven. Using a metal dish may crisp the edges and bottom of your lasagna more than a glass dish would. Also, because metal dishes lose heat quickly, you won't want to wait too long before serving."

If you are using regular noodles, follow package directions for cooking time, and drain thoroughly. Allow them to cool for a few minutes. They can be very hot to handle while assembling the lasagna. Running cold water over them helps this along, but be sure not to let the noodles sit too long after cooling, as they will stick together. If you're using a smaller pan than the recipe calls for or are only making half the recipe, you can cut the cooked noodles to fit. You can also carefully break the no-boil noodles to fit the shape of your dish. Tuck the ends of your noodles into the pan before baking, as any that extend over the edges may burn or dry out and become hard and brittle. For easier serving and a golden edge, lightly buttering your glass or metal baking dishes before assembly. If using a nonstick surface, butter may be unnecessary."

The goal is to get the entire bottom of the dish covered in a layer of noodles. Remember, you can cut or break your noodles to fit the size and shape of your pan if necessary.
