To parboil the lobster, do the following:\nFill a large pot three quarters full with water. Add 2 tablespoons of salt for each quart of water. Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. One at a time, plunge the live lobsters into the water headfirst. Cover the pot with a lid. The length of time you boil the lobsters differs according to how much they weigh. A one-pound lobster should cook for 3 1/2 minutes, a 2-pound lobster for 5 1/2 minutes, and a 3-pound lobster for 7 1/2 minutes. Submerge the parboiled lobster in an ice bath to stop the cooking."
