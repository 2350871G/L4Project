Scrape the edges of the bowl to remove any excess cake batter off the sides. Bake the cake. Place the cake pan in the oven and have the cake bake for about 50-55 minutes, until it rises and the edges are slightly brown. To test if the cake is done, poke a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out dry the cake is ready to be removed from the heat. Have the cake cool. Flip the cake pan on a wire rack. Leave the cake to cool for about 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle and frost. Frost and decorate. Consider frosting the cake with strawberry frosting, cream cheese frosting, or vanilla frosting. Decorate with sprinkles, extra strawberries, cherries, coconut flakes, and/or fondant flowers. Serve and enjoy! Slice a piece of strawberry cake and lay it on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!",
