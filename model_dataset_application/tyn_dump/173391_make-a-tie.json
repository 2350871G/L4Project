You will need 1 \u20442 yards (1.4 m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric. For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on. Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie."

When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric. You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam."

Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric. You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam. Preparing Your Fabric for the Classic Tie Pattern Start with the classic tie pattern. This pattern is a simple and versatile style. You can find different variations of outlines that range in width and length. Simply print out the one you prefer and make sure that it is the classic tie pattern and has a diamond cut at the bottom. Beware of your fabric shrinking. If you're using a fabric other than silk, you should preshrink it by washing and drying it before you iron. This will ensure the fabric doesn't shrink if you have the tie steamed or washed.

To iron, lay the fabric flat on your work surface, \"wrong\" side up, and move the iron in small circles along the material. Cutting the Fabric Lay out the tie pattern on the fabric. It is important to cut the fabric for the tie on the bias (diagonally across the grain) which will allow the tie to have more elasticity. Remember to make sure the fabric is laid out smoothly with no creases. If the fabric is patterned, envision how the pattern will look once you cut the fabric out. Rearrange the layout of your pattern to make sure it will show nicely. Trace the pattern of the tie. Use a weight or pin to hold the pattern outline down. Then, use a piece of chalk to carefully trace around the outline onto the \"wrong\" side of the fabric. Chalk is a safe and easy tracing tool for this type of project. Cut the fabric carefully. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut the fabric about 3/8in around the outside of the chalk line. This will leave room for you to sew the inseam.If you're using a fabric that's more difficult to work with, you might want to use a rotary cutter instead.

Then, carefully cut out the interfacing using sharp scissors or a rotary cutter. The interfacing will end up having the same shape as the fabric you cut, but it won\u2019t need added seam allowance so cut directly on the chalk line. Cut the back liner. You will need to measure out your back liner to fit the bottom diamond of your tie. This will be used to cover the back of your tie that will be left exposed after your tie is folded over and sewed. It is also a nice place to tuck in the back tail of the tie. It will be cut straight across on top, and then follow the bottom cuts of the tie pattern. Applying the Interfacing Check your interfacing. Before applying your interfacing to the fabric, double-check that it has been been preshrunk either by the manufacturer or by you.
