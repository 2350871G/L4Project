Look for plastic wrap that can withstand some heat. If a box of plastic wrap says it can be used in a microwave, you\u2019re good to go. It just needs to be able to heat since it will be placed in boiling water. Trim all the fat from the chicken. If you buy lean chicken, this will most likely not be necessary.

As you roll it, compress as much air out of the plastic wrap and chicken as possible. You want the plastic to be as tightly wrapped around the chicken as possible so that the chicken poaches properly. Hold the plastic ends of both chicken like you would a rolling pin. Roll the wrapped chicken along a flat surface (like a cutting board) just like you would roll a rolling pin. This will wrap the plastic evenly more tightly around the chicken. Tie the loose ends of the plastic wrap together into a double knot. Repeat this wrapping process with the other chicken breast. Turn off the heat once your pot has reached a high simmer. Do not take the pot off of the hot burner. Drop the plastic-wrapped chicken pieces into the water. Be careful not to splash yourself with the very hot water. Cover the pot with the lid.

If you are using very large chicken breast pieces, or are using defrosted chicken that had not defrosted all the way, you may want to let it steep for several minutes more. Remove the chicken from the water with a ladle or other utensil. To remove the chicken from the plastic, hold the chicken over a bowl using oven mitts. Snip the ends of the plastic with a pair of scissors. There are tasty juices inside the plastic wrap so make sure to hold the chicken well over the bowl in order to catch those juices.
