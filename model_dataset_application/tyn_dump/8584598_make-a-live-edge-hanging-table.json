Burl round is cut from the trunk of the tree and often boasts unique patterns but is also usually the most expensive.

For a larger surface area like the top and bottom of your wood, use 80 grit sandpaper. For cracks and crevices, 60 grit sandpaper works best. Once you\u2019ve leveled out your wood, you can sand it again with a higher grit 220 sandpaper until the entire piece of wood is smooth. Sand your wood in an open and well-ventilated area.
