Buying the verbena plants allows you to ask the clerks how tall they grow and compare different colors. You can find verbena plants in white, red, purple, pink or multi-colored varieties. Plant your verbena seeds in the winter if you want to grow them from seed. Sew two seeds to every peat or fiber pot. Keep the soil damp but not overwatered. Use warm water to keep the soil warmer during germination. Seeds will take approximately one month to sprout. Grow indoors until they produce three to four leaves. Then, start hardening them by placing them outside during the day in full sunlight. Growing Verbena Choose locations for your verbena plants that get 8 to 10 hours of direct sunlight. Verbena plants are prone to developing powdery mildew if they don\u2019t get enough sun. Plant the verbena seedlings in late spring or early summer. Make sure that you are well past your last frost and the days are long. Ensure they are planted in well-drained soil. After you place them in the ground, fertilize the ground with flower fertilizer. Fertilize monthly for the rest of the growing season. Water to keep the soil moist during the first few weeks after planting.  Change your water regimen after the verbena plants are well rooted.

Overwatering and watering from overhead are common mistakes with verbena care. Encouraging Verbena Flowers Deadhead verbena plants after the first full bloom. Prune one-fourth of the plants top growth, include old flower blooms. Take care not to prune on the main stem. Prune two to three times per season. The next bloom will appear in 15 to 20 days.
