The fork or chopsticks should be held between eight and ten inches above your saucepan. To make the eggs look like ribbons instead of shreds, stir the eggs clockwise but do it at a slow, steady, and controlled rate. Be careful not to let the egg streams touch too much, since this will cause unattractive clumping and rubbery eggs."
