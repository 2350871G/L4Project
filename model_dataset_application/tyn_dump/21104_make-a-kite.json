Make them deep enough to fit the string you are going to use to attach the sail. If you are using very thin sticks and thin string, you can poke holes into the ends of the sticks instead of making notches."

Fabric can also work for the sail in a pinch, though it should be thick and sturdy so the sail is strong. Lay the frame on the sail. Spread the material you are using for the sail flat on the ground.

You can then add string to the flying line to make it longer based on your arm length and height. Sometimes, adding more string to the flying line can also help the kite to fly straighter. Make a kite tail with a 6 feet (1.8 m) long piece of thick string. Attach the tail to the bottom end of the frame, looping it over the frame several times and tying it tightly. Use thick string or a strip of cloth for the tail. Pick a string or cloth color that matches the color of your sail so your kite looks pretty in the air. Attach pieces of cloth or ribbon to the tail at 1 foot (0.30 m) intervals. Use pieces that are 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long. Tie them onto the tail with a small knot, allowing them to dangle down off the string. The cloth or ribbon pieces will help the tail stay balanced and ensure the kite flies straight.
