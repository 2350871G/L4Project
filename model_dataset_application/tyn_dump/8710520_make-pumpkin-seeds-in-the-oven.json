  "text":" Cutting up the Pumpkin Purchase a cooking pumpkin. It\u2019s common for people to extract and roast the seeds from their Halloween pumpkins. While this is a fine option, there are pumpkins designed for consumption and commonly referred to as \u201ccooking pumpkins.\u201d These pumpkins are smaller than the large carving pumpkins used for Halloween decorations, and you may notice a minor difference in consistency and taste between the cooking and carving pumpkin seeds. Cut the top off of the pumpkin. Place the pumpkin on a durable cutting board and, using a sharp kitchen knife\u2014such as a carving knife\u2014cut the top off of the pumpkin. This will give you access to the pulpy middle of the gourd, which contains the seeds. Quarter the pumpkin. Once you\u2019ve removed the top, use your carving knife to slice the pumpkin into four evenly sized quarters. Do this by setting the pumpkin upright (with the place where the stem would\u2019ve been pointing upwards), and cutting straight down through the pumpkin. Once it\u2019s halved, repeat the process and cut each of the halves in half. If you\u2019re removing the seeds from a large carving pumpkin, you may not need to quarter the gourd. Carving pumpkins often have a large enough opening at the top to extract the pulp and seeds from. Scrape the pulp and seeds into a colander. Once the pumpkin has been quartered, grab a sturdy kitchen spoon and use it to scrape the stringy pulp (which contains the seeds) into a colander.
