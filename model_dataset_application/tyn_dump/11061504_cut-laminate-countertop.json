Buy a piece of stock laminate countertop as close to the correct length as you can. Tip: Retailers who you buy your countertop from will also sell matching laminate strips that you can buy to cover the exposed part of the countertop after you make any cuts. If you get lucky, you might find that the counter area you need to cover is exactly divisible by 2, in which case you won\u2019t need to cut the countertop to fit.
