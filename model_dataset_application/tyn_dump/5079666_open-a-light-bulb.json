Keep a firm grasp on the light bulb with your other hand while lifting out the solder point. You may need to nudge the sides of the solder point back and forth if twisting it does not prove effective. The sides of the metal should be raised enough for you to get a good grip on the tip with your pliers before you lift that point out."

The glass here is thick, so it will take a lot of force to actually break it. Make sure that you hold onto the bulb firmly with your other hand as you work. The insulator will break into many chips when you do this, so proceed with caution. You may need to break the insulator from several angles around its perimeter if the entire thing does not break off the first time."

  "text":" Opening the Light Bulb Grip the solder point with pliers. Look at the bottom of the light bulb and identify the small metal solder point.

You'll be breaking glass during this step and during many of the other steps in this process, so it might be best to work over a box or several sheets of newspaper.

At this point, the light bulb is open and empty. You may even be able to stop here, but continue reading to determine whether or not that is the case. Removing the Metal Socket Ask yourself if this is necessary. For most projects, you can keep the metal socket piece intact. If you only want the actual glass bulb for your project, however, you will need to remove the socket piece before continuing. You may want to remove this piece for visual aesthetics. Another reason to remove it would be to create as large an opening at the base of the bulb as possible.

The acid should have dissolved the powerful adhesive glue holding the metal socket to the glass, making the socket loose and fairly easy to remove. If done carefully, you should be able to avoid breaking any glass at the bottom of the bulb. Cleaning the Open Bulb Determine if this is necessary. If you started with a clear bulb, you don't need to clean it out. If you used a bulb coated with white kaolin powder, however, you'll want to clean this powder out before using the bulb for anything. Kaolin is considered a safe substance, but you should still avoid ingesting it or getting it in your eyes. Keep your goggles and gloves on. Insert paper towels into the bulb. Stuff enough paper towel into the bulb to fill most of it, leaving a long enough \"tail\" sticking out from the bottom for you to grab. Watch out for any sharp edges or sharp bits of broken glass.
