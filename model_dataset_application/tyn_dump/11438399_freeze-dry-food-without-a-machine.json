If you\u2019re using your regular home freezer, set it to the lowest temperature possible, which is typically -10\u00b0F (-23\u00b0C). Most freezers are already set to 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C). If your freezer doesn\u2019t go lower than that, that\u2019s okay, it will just take longer to dry the food. Use a freezer thermometer to test the temperature if your freezer doesn\u2019t already have a dial."

          "description":"Fruits and vegetables with a high water content are the easiest to freeze dry, so start with things like apples, berries, potatoes, carrots, and other veggies. You can also freeze dry cooked pasta noodles and meat. Freeze-drying dairy like cheese and yogurt is possible, but it won\u2019t have the same creamy taste and texture. Make sure to cook the meat before you freeze dry it. It\u2019s best to freeze dry it that same day (after letting it cool in the fridge for a few hours) but you can freeze dry meat that\u2019s been stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. You can freeze dry chicken, deli meats, steak, ground beef, fish, and shrimp. Whole meals, desserts, soups, herbs, and instant coffee can be freeze dried as well!"

Try to make each piece about the same size so they dry at the same rate. If you\u2019re freeze drying small berries like blueberries, blackberries, or raspberries, there\u2019s no need to slice them. But when it comes to large strawberries, slice them into even chunks or slivers. If you want to freeze dry meat, cook the meat first and then slice it into strips about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick.

Spread them into a single layer and make sure there\u2019s no overlapping.

To test meat, take a piece out, let it warm up for about 5 to 10 minutes, and bend it in half. If you see any moisture coming out of the meat, it\u2019s not done yet.

    "Make sure the bags aren\u2019t exposed to moisture or direct sunlight.",
    "Freeze-dried food will stay good for up to 25 years!",
    "You can eat any of your freeze-dried foods dry or rehydrate them by letting the pieces sit in a small amount of water.",
    "Freeze Drying with Dry Ice Wash the produce you want to freeze dry and cook any meat.",
    "Wash fruit and vegetables under cool running water before patting each item dry with a paper towel.",
    "If you\u2019re drying poultry, beef, or fish, make sure to cook them first.",
    "Pasta noodles should be cooked as well.",
    "You don\u2019t need to wash cheeses before you freeze dry them.",
    "Slice larger items into chunks about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) across.",
    "Use a sharp knife to slice larger fruit and vegetables into small chunks about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) across.",
    "If you\u2019re freeze drying cooked meat, slice it into slivers less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.",
    "Try to make each piece the same size so they freeze dry at the same rate.",
    "Small fruits like blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries can be freeze dried whole.",
    "Slice larger pieces of produce like potatoes, apples, and pears into smaller chunks.",
    "If you\u2019re freeze drying a loaf of bread, use a serrated knife to cut it into slices about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick.",
    "Put the chopped food chunks into freezer bags and seal the bags.",
    "Put the sliced chunks into freezer bags.",
    "Be sure to put only 1 type of food per bag rather than mixing different kinds of foods together.",
    "Then, push out all of the air from the bags with your hands or by rolling the air out (toward the opening) with a rolling pin.",
    "Pushing out the air will ensure that no ice crystals form on the food.",
    "Choose a storage box large enough that the bags only fill it half way.",
    "A large styrofoam cooler or large plastic container with a lid will work nicely.",
    "Note that the box will have to fit inside of your freezer, so if you have a small freezer, you may only be able to freeze dry small quantities of food at a time.",
    "Pick a plastic container you don\u2019t plan to use for other purposes because you\u2019ll need to put holes in the lid.",
    "Pour 1 pound (0.45 kg) of dry ice into the bottom of the box.",
    "Put on heavy duty gloves like leather or work gloves to pour dry ice over into the bottom of the box until it forms an even layer.",
    "The amount of dry ice you need to use is equal to the weight of the food.",
    "So if you\u2019re freezing 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of food, you\u2019ll need about 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of dry ice.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t cover the entire bottom of the box, add another 1 pound (0.45 kg) until it does.",
    "Depending on the width and length of the box, 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of dry ice should be enough for up to 4 layers of food.",
    "Don\u2019t touch the dry ice with your bare hands\u2014it will burn your skin!",
    "If you don\u2019t have heavy duty or leather gloves, use oven mitts or thick kitchen towels.",
    "Purchase dry ice cubes online or at your local grocery store or supermarket.",
    "Sandwich the food bags between layers of dry ice.",
    "Layer the bags on top of the bottom level of dry ice and then pour in another 1 pound (0.45 kg) to 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of dry ice to completely cover the bags.",
    "Make sure not to stack two bags directly on top of each other.",
    "You may need to rearrange the pieces of dry ice so that the bags are fully covered.",
    "Make sure each bag lays as flat as possible and that there\u2019s no overlapping.",
    "Add a final layer of dry ice on top of the food bags.",
    "Depending on the size of the box and the number of bags you have, you may need to do a few alternating layers of dry ice and food bags.",
    "Each layer of food should have dry ice on top of and underneath it.",
    "Poke a few holes into the lid and attach it to the box.",
    "Use a box cutter or sharp knife to cut 3 to 4 holes into the top of the box.",
    "These holes allow gas and moisture to escape, which is necessary for the dry ice to dissipate and for the food to fully dry.",
    "Avoid poking too many holes into the lid.",
    "The idea is to allow the gas to escape at a relatively slow rate.",
    "Place the box into the freezer for at least 24 hours.",
    "The food is done freezer drying when all of the dry ice has disappeared.",
    "This could take 24 hours or more depending on how many layers of food you\u2019re freeze drying (and how much dry ice you\u2019ve used to cover it).",
    "Wear gloves to remove the lid of the box and look into the container.",
    "If you don\u2019t see any dry ice on top, shuffle the bags around with a gloved hand to check for dry ice on the bottom.",
    "If it\u2019s all gone, the food is ready for storage.",
    "If you see any chunks of dry ice, reattach the lid, reinsert the box into the freezer, and wait for 3 to 6 hours before checking again.",
    "Store freeze-dried foods in freezer bags at room temperature.",
    "Since the foods are already in freezer bags, you can just take them out and put them in your pantry or anywhere that\u2019s at or below room temperature.",
    "The freeze-dried food will stay good for up to 25 years.",
    "Eat the freeze-dried chunks as is or rehydrate them by placing them in a small amount of water."
