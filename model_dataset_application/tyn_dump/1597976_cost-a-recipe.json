          "description":"Most of your ingredients on your list will only be one part of the full unit that you purchased. To calculate the cost, divide the amount that the recipe requires by the full amount that is in the unit that you purchased. This gives you the proportion of the full unit that you will use for the recipe. Some recipes will call for specific amounts, such as 500 g (1.1 lb) of mince. This makes calculating how much you use easy, because if you bought a 1000 g (2.2 lb) pack it would be 500 / 1000, which works out to be 0.5. For recipes that don\u2019t specify a numerical quantity, and instead say a handful, a pinch, or a sprinkle, weigh out the amount that you plan to use. Then you can do the calculation. For example, if you needed two handfuls of spinach, place two handfuls on a set of kitchen scales, and record the weight. If the spinach that is required weighs 100 g (3.5 oz), and you purchased a 300 g (10.6 oz) bag, then you calculation would be 100 / 300, which is 0.3."

This means that the cost for the spinach that you are using in your recipe would be $0.60. For the mince example, the proportion that you calculated was required for your recipe is 0.5. This means that if the full unit of mince cost $10.00, the amount that is used for the recipe cost $5.00. Write down each cost that you calculated next to the ingredient on the list."
