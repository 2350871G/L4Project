    "Spread your tape measure from one side of the window frame to the other.",
    "The rod can hang inside the window frame or over it.",
    "If the rod will hang over the frame, it can extend a little past it to ensure the curtains cover everything.",
    "Measure the width at the top, center, and bottom of the window.",
    "Your window may be uneven, giving you different measurements at each point.",
    "The rod needs to be as long as the widest part of the window.",
    "Curtains are far more customizable than films and sprays, but they restrict light when they are closed.",
    "This can make them a bad option for areas where you desire natural light, such as in a bathroom.",
    "Mark where the curtain rod will hang on your window.",
    "You have 2 options when choosing where to place the curtain rod.",
    "Inside-mounted rods hang in front of the glass, inside the window frame.",
    "Outside-mounted rods hang 3 to 6 in (7.6 to 15.2 cm) above the frame.",
    "Using a pencil and a ruler, trace a straight line indicating where the rod will hang.",
    "Outside-mounted rods obscure the window frame and may be the better choice if you want to hide an imperfect window.",
    "Inside-mounted rods are good for showing off perfect, square window frames.",
    "Blinds are an alternative to curtains for a different aesthetic.",
    "They can be hung by following the same steps you would use when hanging curtain rods.",
    "Measure from the top of the window to determine the curtain length.",
    "Before making a measurement, decide how far down you want the curtains to hang.",
    "This can depend on what kind of rod you use.",
    "For inside-mounted rods, the curtains usually end at the bottom edge of the window frame.",
    "For outside-mounted rods, you may wish to extend the curtains all the way to the floor.",
    "Curtains can end right above the floor or touch it.",
    "Having the curtains touch the floor can be a good look for a large living room but bad in a bathroom, for example.",
    "It all depends on your personal preference.",
    "Purchase a curtain rod and curtains.",
    "Find a curtain rod that matches the size you need for your window.",
    "Most curtain rods include the screws and brackets you need to mount them.",
    "Also, use the measurements you took earlier to purchase or make your own curtains.",
    "Curtains come in a variety of styles, so choose what suits your needs and the aesthetic of your room.",
    "Cased headed curtains rest tightly on curtain rods and good for rooms you don\u2019t use frequently.",
    "Pleated curtains are fuller and more decorative than other types of curtains, which also makes them a little costlier.",
    "They fit almost any room.",
    "Goblet curtains are similar but have a different shape.",
    "Tab top and eyelet curtains hang directly on curtain rods.",
    "They have a very even appearance and are often made of strong fabric, making them resistant to damage from frequent moving.",
    "Mark and drill holes for the brackets.",
    "Hold the brackets up to the edges of the line you traced earlier.",
    "Use your pencil to trace the brackets.",
    "Then, mark the spots where you need to insert the screws and drill holes through these spots with an electric drill.",
    "Pre-drilling the holes ensure the screws pass cleanly into the wall.",
    "They may cause cracks if the holes aren\u2019t made first.",
    "Install the brackets with an electric screwdriver.",
    "Position the brackets on the wall, making sure they are straight before you install them.",
    "Set the included screws in the holes.",
    "Drill the screws in until the brackets are secured to the wall.",
    "The screws may chip the wall paint or plaster a little.",
    "It\u2019s unavoidable, but the bracket will cover it up.",
    "Test the brackets with a carpenter\u2019s level.",
    "Place the level on the brackets one at a time.",
    "The level should have a liquid in the middle.",
    "If the bubble in the liquid stays in the center, the bracket is positioned correctly.",
    "If it slides to one side, the bracket is uneven.",
    "Remove the screws and straighten out the bracket.",
    "It\u2019s important to get the brackets level to make the curtain rod look level as well.",
    "Otherwise, the curtains may hang noticeably lower on one side.",
    "Place the curtain on the rods.",
    "The rod needs to be off of the brackets in order to slip the curtain onto it.",
    "Thread the rod through the loops in the upper part of the curtain, pulling the curtain down to the end of the rod.",
    "Continue doing this until the curtain is in place.",
    "Blinds can be installed the same way, except you may need to fit the blinds into tabs that hang from the rod.",
    "The tabs can add a little length to the blinds.",
    "Hang the curtain rod on the brackets.",
    "Use a stepping stool as needed to reach the top of the brackets.",
    "Carry the curtain rod up to the brackets then fit it in place.",
    "Depending on the type of bracket, you need to either set the rod on top of the brackets or slide it through them.",
    "To finish, check the curtain rod a final time with a carpenter\u2019s level."
