Measure the diameter of the pipe you want to cut and purchase an autocut tool for that exact size. Autocut tools are spring loaded so you won't be able to adjust the size of the cut. For example, for a small 1/2 inch (12 mm) pipe, buy a 1/2 inch (12 mm) autocut tool. Autocut tools come in 1/2 inch (12 mm), 3/4 inch (19 mm), and 1 inch (2.5 cm) sizes."

Turn the tool 20 to 30 times until the pipe is cut. The auto cut tool makes a clean, smooth cut, so you won't need to clean the pipe before using it."
