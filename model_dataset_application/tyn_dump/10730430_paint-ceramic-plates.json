  "text":" Cleaning the Plates Use white ovenproof ceramic plates as a blank canvas. Plain ceramic plates serve as a nice background for many different designs. If the plates have any stickers, be sure to peel those off after you purchase them. You can buy ovenproof ceramic plates at craft stores or art supply stores. Wash and dry the plates to prepare for painting. Use your regular dish soap and warm water to give the plates a quick wash. This will remove any dust or debris that have settled onto the plates. Specks of dust or dirt may ruin the look of your painted design. Be sure to remove any price or barcode stickers from your plates. Wipe the plates with rubbing alcohol to remove any soap residue. Dip a clean paper towel or soft cloth quickly into a bottle of rubbing alcohol. Wipe the rubbing alcohol on your plates. This will remove any lingering soap residue. Rubbing alcohol will also remove any sticker residue from your plates. Let your plates air dry for 1 to 2 hours. After wiping your plates down with alcohol, let them dry for 1 to 2 hours before you paint them. If you paint them while they're still wet, that might affect your paint or the design on your plates. Wash your hands after handling rubbing alcohol. Creating a Design Sketch or practice your design on paper first. To prevent mistakes while painting your plate, sketch your design out or practice your technique on paper first. Basic, simple designs will be easier to paint, while more intricate designs may take more time. Choose a design you're comfortable with. Use stencil letters to trace a message onto your plates. Lightly trace the stencil with a pencil to guide you when you paint. You can find stencils with words or messages on them at craft stores or art supply stores. Or, create your own words or phrases using single letter stencils. If your stencil letters are narrow, you'll need a paintbrush with a fine tip or a ceramic paint pen to fill them in. Create a geometric pattern of dots or shapes. Create stripes using painter's tape. You can also try a polka dot or square pattern. If you'd rather not paint your design freehand, use a stencil to create a pattern of shapes. Shape stencils can be used to create patterns of stars, arrows, hearts, flowers, or diamonds. Experiment with different colors for an interesting layered design. On a palette or plate, briefly stir a few dabs of paint in different colors together using the other end of your paintbrush. See what the colors look like when mixed and choose a combination for your plates. Pairing bold colors like blue, yellow and red will create a pop art design. Splatter paint with a wet brush for an abstract, textured look. Dip a wet paintbrush in paint and flick the bristles gently at a large piece of paper to see the effects. This design can get messy, but your plates will look artsy and fun. Start with one color first, then choose another to splatter on top. Different splatter colors add even more texture and interest. Painting Your Design Buy food and dishwasher safe ceramic paint if the plates will be used for food. Make sure your ceramic paint is labeled food safe and toxic-free if it will be used to serve food. If your plates will be displayed in a case or hung on a wall as decoration only, you can use enamel acrylic paint. Some paints are more durable and scratch-resistant.
