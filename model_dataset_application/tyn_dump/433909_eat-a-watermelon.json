          "description":"Picking a ripe watermelon doesn't need to be a total mystery. There are two basic ways to pick a melon that's ripened to perfection, which involve using your eyes and your hands:\nFeel the melon. Pick it up and feel the weight. Good melons should feel slightly heavier than they look. That means they're juicy and sweet. If you tap a melon, your knuckles should bounce back. If the melon feels hollow or soft, that's a bad sign. The surface should feel quite firm. Bumpiness is a sign of irregular watering. Look at the melon. Ripe melons should have a \"field spot,\" which is usually yellowish or brownish on one side, which may be slightly flatter. This means the melon was allowed to ripen for a while on the ground before being picked. Avoid any melons with a very shiny green surface, which is a sign of under-ripeness."

          "description":"Even though you don't eat the rind of the watermelon, it's still a good idea to give it a rinse. The knife you use to cut it up will pass through the outside, which can still have residual pesticides and other stuff from the dirt on it. Even if you grew it yourself, it's still a good idea to give it a rinse before you cut it up."

          "headline":"Cut melon into wedges or chunks.",
          "description":"There's no wrong way to eat watermelon. The most classic way is to slice it into hand-held pieces and eat it right down to the rind, but cutting up melon into chunks and eating with skewers or a fork is also perfectly delicious. Place the clean, dry melon on a flat cutting surface. You can stabilize the melon with your your hand on the other end of the melon, or by placing the melon on a towel. Use a sharp chef's knife to cut watermelon, and keep your fingers clear of the knife as you work. Check out the next section for different ways to slice up your watermelon."

Part of the fun or the challenge of eating watermelon is negotiating these seeds and getting rid of them. Spit them into a small cup if you're inside, or take the melon outside and have a spitting contest in the yard. It's hard to do elegantly."

          "description":"Watermelon is great, but chilled melon in the summertime? Out of this world. If you've picked a ripe melon, storing it in the refrigerator will help to keep it fresh as well as add some refreshing coolness to the melon. It's always a good idea. It's hard to eat a whole watermelon at once. If your group can't finish one, cut it into chunks and store them in a bowl in the fridge, or cover the melon with plastic wrap and put it cut-side up in the refrigerator. It'll be even better when it's cool."

The thought is, the salt creates a sweet-salty contrast that makes the melon actually taste a little sweeter. Watermelon's pretty subtle, though. If you want to try salting yours, it's important to use a very small portion of salt. Don't overwhelm the fruit. Try putting out a little dish of salt and dipping the melon into it, rather than dumping it onto the fruit. Much easier to control the portions."

Cut these in half to make two half-moon shaped slices, or cut again into triangles. Hold by the rind and enjoy. You can also cut down the middle of the watermelon long-ways, then cut extra-long sections of watermelon to dive into. They might be messy, so it's best to eat them outside. Some people also like to start in the center, cutting the melon in half to get right to the juiciest parts of the melon. This can be effective, especially if you've got a really big watermelon. There's no wrong way. What do you do with the melon in the end-piece? Scoop it out with a spoon."

Cut big slices as normal, then use a smaller paring knife to remove the whitish-green rind from the melon. Cut into chunks that suit your taste. Cut into cubes, triangles, or other shapes. Use butter knives with your kids to let them chop up watermelon into animal shapes, or letters. Or use cookie cutters for real fun. Some people like peeling the rind off before chunking up a watermelon. This can be done with a sharp chef's knife and some care, stabilizing the melon on a flat cut side, or it can be done with a vegetable peeler."
