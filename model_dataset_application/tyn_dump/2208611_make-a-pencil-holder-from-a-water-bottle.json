Making a Pencil Caddy Cut down 7 water bottles, with one of them being taller than the rest. The first 6 water bottles should all be the same height. The 7th bottle should be cut 1inch (2.54 centimeters) taller. Make sure all bottles are the same size and shape. A pencil caddy is ideal for those who have a lot of different pencils, and like to keep organized. They are also perfect for keeping pencils, colored pencils, crayons, and pens all separate.

Decorating the Bottle in Other Ways Color a blank bottle with permanent markers for something quick and easy. If you don't want to use tissue paper, you can simply draw on your bottle with permanent markers. This will give you a translucent, stained glass effect. If you make a mistake, dip a q-tip in rubbing alcohol, and \"erase\" the mistake. Wipe the area dry, and continue drawing. Paint the bottle using acrylic paint or spray paint for something colorful. To make the paint stick better, consider buffing the entire bottle using a fine grit sand paper. Paint the entire bottle a solid color first, wait for the paint to dry, then add details, such as flowers. Decorate a blank or painted bottle with stickers for something simple. If you don't have a lot of supplies on hand, you can always decorate the bottle with stickers.
