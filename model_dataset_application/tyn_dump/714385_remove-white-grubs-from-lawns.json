The nematodes come on a sponge that you\u2019ll dip into a bucket of plain water, squeezing the sponge in the water to make sure all the nematodes are released. Pour that water into a sprayer or watering can before applying it to your lawn where the grubs have affected the grass. Read the instructions that come with the nematodes for details about how to apply them to your grass. Purchase nematodes in a gardening store or online. Be aware that the nematodes are alive, so you\u2019ll want to use them quickly after purchasing to ensure they stay active and healthy."

Milky spore isn\u2019t an immediate fix\u2014it can take 1-3 years for you to begin seeing the effects\u2014but it is a very effective long-term grub solution. Once the milky spore begins working, you won't need to reapply it for 15-20 years. This works best for Japanese beetle grub larvae. Purchase milky spore from your local hardware or gardening store.

You can either plan to spread the pesticide before it\u2019s supposed to rain, or you can plan on using a sprinkler to water the grass afterwards.

Pour the bag of pesticide into the yard spreader, checking the settings of the spreader to make sure they\u2019re on an appropriate setting.

For example, if your yard is 4,800 ft (1,500 m) squared, a bag of pesticide that covers 5,000 ft (1,500 m) squared will work well.
