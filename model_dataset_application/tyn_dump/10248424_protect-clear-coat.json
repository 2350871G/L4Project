Hot sunlight can also open small \u201cpores\u201d in your car\u2019s clear coat, allowing more dirt and debris to get in. So, to protect the clear coat and lengthen its lifespan, park your car in a garage or in shade whenever possible. If you park your car in your driveway, consider setting up a small awning or covering to keep the sun off your car\u2019s paint. You can find this type of awning at most large home-goods stores."

If you spot any bird droppings on your vehicle\u2019s paint, rinse them off immediately with water from a hose. Better yet, avoid letting birds leave their droppings on your car in the first place.

However, tree sap is a double threat: the sap can soak into your clear coat and damage it directly, or it can attract dust and dirt and force these materials into your clear coat. So, avoid parking under or near sap-filled trees, especially if you know there are 1 or 2 branches that always seem to leak out sap.

If you try to wax your vehicle in cold weather, the wax will be sluggish and may barely move when you try to spread it on the paint. Conversely, if you wax your vehicle in hot weather, the wax may run or the heat may bake the wax into the clear coat.
