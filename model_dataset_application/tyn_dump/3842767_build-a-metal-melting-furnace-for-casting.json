          "description":"Look for a steel garbage can that\u2019s at least 18 inches (46 cm) tall and has a diameter of 16 inches (41 cm). If the garbage is taller than 18 inches (46 cm), put a metal-cutting blade on an angle grinder and turn it on. Carefully cut around the outside of the garbage can to trim it down to size. Wear safety glasses while working with an angle grinder so you don\u2019t get any metal scraps in your eyes. Be careful of the cut edges on the garbage can since they may be sharp and could cut you easily. If you don\u2019t have an angle grinder or you just want a smaller forge, you can also use a 10 US qt (9.5 L) steel bucket that\u2019s 11 in (28 cm) tall."

Use a utility knife to cut a circular piece of ceramic fiber wool that\u2019s the same size as the bottom of the garbage can. Push the piece of wool tightly against the bottom of the can. Then wrap the wool around the inner sidewalls of the garbage can as tightly as you can. You can buy ceramic fiber wool from home improvement stores or online. Ceramic fiber wool may cause irritation if it comes into contact with bare skin.

You can buy rigidizer online. Label the spray bottle you use for your rigidizer so you don\u2019t mix it up with other bottles you have.

    "Cut a hole in the wool that lines up with the lid\u2019s hole.",
    "Flip the lid so the handle faces up and locate the hole you drilled early.",
    "Poke a craft knife along the edge of the hole so it goes completely through the wool.",
    "Saw back and forth along the edge of the hole to remove the section of wool covering it.",
    "Don\u2019t leave the wool over the hole or else your furnace won\u2019t vent properly.Tip: If you have trouble cutting through the wool with a craft knife, then try using a serrated bread knife since it may cut through the wool easier.",
    "Apply a rigidizer to the wool and leave it to cure for 24 hours.",
    "Put your rigidizer compound in a spray bottle, and apply it directly to the ceramic fiber wool on the lid.",
    "Make sure to coat all of the exposed surfaces with the rigidizer or else it won\u2019t effectively harden.",
    "Once you\u2019ve put the rigidizer on all of the wool, let it set in a well-ventilated room for at least 24 hours so it can set.",
    "You can apply rigidizer with a paintbrush if you don\u2019t have a spray bottle handy.",
    "Brush furnace cement on all of the exposed wool to insulate it more.",
    "Mix your furnace cement with a stir stick to make sure it\u2019s thoroughly combined.",
    "Use a 2 in (5.1 cm) paintbrush to coat the exposed surfaces of the wool.",
    "Smooth out the cement with the brush before letting it set for at least 24 hours.",
    "Put cardboard or shop cloths down before you apply the cement so you don\u2019t accidentally get it on anything.",
    "Providing a Fuel Source Feed a steel pipe or burner through the side hole of the furnace.",
    "The kind of pipe you use depends on what you want to use for your fuel source.",
    "If you want to use charcoal inside of your furnace, then put a 12 in (30 cm) steel pipe that has a diameter of 1 in (2.5 cm) through the hole.",
    "Make sure the pipe extends at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) past the inside wall of the furnace.",
    "If you want to use propane, place a burner inside of the furnace and feed the valve end of the pipe through the side hole.",
    "Position the end of the burner inside your furnace so it points off-center.",
    "You can buy a furnace propane burner online.",
    "Don\u2019t use a regular steel pipe for propane since you won\u2019t be able to control the flame as easily.",
    "Attach an air blower to the end of the pipe with a coupler if you want to use charcoal.",
    "A coupler allows you to attach pipes together without welding the pieces together.",
    "Slide the end of the coupler onto the end of the steel pipe that\u2019s outside of the furnace.",
    "Slide the other end of the coupler over the end of an air blower to force air through the furnace so it heats better.",
    "You can buy couplers from your local hardware store.",
    "If you don\u2019t have an air blower, you can use an old hair dryer on the highest fan setting to move the air.",
    "Connect a propane tank to the other end of the burner if you\u2019re using gas.",
    "Attach an air supply hose between the valve on your propane tank and the control port on the end of the burner.",
    "Make sure the valves are completely closed while you aren\u2019t running the furnace so you don\u2019t waste your fuel or create a fire hazard.",
    "You can attach any propane tank to your furnace, but small tanks will run out faster while you\u2019re running your furnace.",
    "Light your furnace so it can heat up.",
    "If you\u2019re using charcoal, fill the bottom of the furnace with 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of briquettes and use a lighter to light them.",
    "Turn on the air blower on its lowest setting to help the furnace heat up further.",
    "If you\u2019re using propane, open the valves on the tank and the burner.",
    "Reach a striker into the middle of your furnace and squeeze it to ignite the propane.",
    "Put the lid on top of the furnace so the heat doesn\u2019t escape.",
    "Use the valves on the propane tank and burner to control the size of the flame it produces.",
    "The flames from your furnace may come out from the vent hole you made in the lid, so use caution while you\u2019re handling it.",
    "Charcoal furnaces can usually reach a temperature of about 1,200 \u00b0F (649 \u00b0C) while propane can reach 2,300 \u00b0F (1,260 \u00b0C).",
    "Use a crucible when you want to melt metal.",
    "A crucible is a metal container that you put inside of your furnace that holds the metal you\u2019re melting.",
    "Put the metal you want to melt inside the crucible and use a pair of fire tongs to set it in the middle of your furnace.",
    "Allow the furnace to heat the crucible and melt the metal before taking it out with tongs for casting.",
    "This furnace will melt low-temperature metals, such as aluminum and brass."
