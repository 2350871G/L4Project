  "text":" Placing the First Panel and Track Measure the garage door opening before purchasing panels. Use a tape measure to carefully record the length and width of the opening. Order this size so the panels will be made slightly smaller, fitting perfectly in the doorway. The panels will be about \u20444 in (6.4 mm) smaller than the opening. Lay weather stripping over the bottom door panel. At a home improvement store, purchase some rubber weather stripping. Lay the panel flat on a workbench. The stripping is shaped like a tube, and you can fit the edge of the door panel in the tube's groove. Any of the panels can be used as the lower panel. Pick one, but remember that the one with the weather stripping is the one that needs to be placed first. Place brackets over the panel's lower corners. Place 1 bracket on each side of the door over the weather stripping. When the brackets appear level with the door's edges, secure them to the panel with lag screws and a cordless screwdriver. Center the door panel in the garage doorway. Have a friend help you pick up and move the heavy panel to the doorway. Position the panel in the center of the doorway, then hold a level over the panel to make sure it's level. Use shims to adjust the panel as needed. Shims are small wood strips you can slide under the door panel to even out the sides. Purchase packs at a home improvement store. Screw hinges to the top of the panel. Start by installing a hinge in each of the panel's upper corners. Screw them in place with more lag screws. Center another hinge on this top edge and screw it in place. Insert rollers into the hinges and brackets. The rollers have metal rods that you slide into the holes on the hinges and brackets. Set 1 roller in both of the brackets as well as both side hinges. Wrap the roller track around the wheels. Pick a side to focus on first. Get the bottom piece of the track and work it onto the wheels. It'll have an indentation that the wheels fit into cleanly. Once you have the wheels in place, line up the track against the door frame. Screw the track to the door frame. Make sure there's a little bit of space between the track and door frame so the door doesn't create friction later. Find the track's brackets, then use lag screws to secure the track directly to the door frame. Fastening the Other Panels and Track Install 2 hinges on the next door panel. Lay the next door panel on the workbench. You'll install the hinges the same way you did before, only this time you'll leave the trackless side empty. Align a hinge in 1 of the corners and in the center of the panel, then screw them in place. Leaving 1 side bare makes fitting and installing the track easier, so do this for every panel. Place the second panel on top of the first one. With a friend, pick up the new door panel. Fit it on top of the first one, taking care to line up the side edges. Use the hinges to connect the door panels. Move the hinges on the first panel so their tops are on the second panel. See how they align so you know where the screws will go. Pre-drill pilot holes there, then fasten the hinges in place with more lag screws. Install the remaining hinge and roller. First, place the roller in the hinge. Place it over the empty corner of the door panel, but don't fasten it yet. Bring the remaining roller track over and fit it around the wheels, then screw the hinge in place. Fasten the track to the wall. Line up the remaining track so it's against the door frame. Slip screws into the brackets to secure the track directly to the door frame. Before moving on, tighten up the screws in both track brackets as needed. Remember to leave a little bit of space between the track and door frame. Connect the horizontal track pieces to the vertical ones. Set up a couple of ladders on 1 side of the door. You'll need someone to help you lift the track and hold it in place. Line up the curved section of the track with the track piece you placed earlier. Slide screws into the track holes and ratchet them in place. Fasten the tracks to perforated angle irons. You'll need a pair of 1 \u20444 in (3.2 cm) angle irons from the home improvement or hardware store. These need to be screwed to joists in the ceiling. Near the end of the tracks, connect the angle irons and tracks with a pair of supporting brackets. To find the joists, use a stud finder. Complete the tracks with stop bolts. Purchase a pair of 1 \u20442 in \u00d7 \u20444 in (3.81 cm \u00d7 0.64 cm) stop bolts. These go at the end of the upper tracks. Slide them into the holes, facing the threads towards the inside of the track. Then fasten them with a ratchet wrench. Set the other door panels in place. Continue stacking and securing the panels together with hinges and screws. When you reach the last panel, don't install the hinges or wheels yet. Be careful, since the panel will fall forward if no one's holding it in place. Secure the top hinges and rollers to the curved track. The hinges on the top panel need to be placed partway down the door. Line it up so the wheels rest on the curved part of the track. Finish by fastening the hinges in place with screws. Installing a Torsion Lifting Spring Purchase a torsion spring system. You can find DIY-friendly torsion spring kits at the home improvement store. They come with all the parts and directions needed to install the spring system safely and effectively. If you're still uncertain, you can always hire a professional to get the job done. You may instead use tension springs to lift the door. These are cheaper but more prone to breaking. Installation involves running cables over pulleys and through springs hooked to the angle brackets. Attach the spring to wall brackets above the door. Measure the length of the spring to find out how to space the brackets. Screw the holding brackets above the garage door opening, then rest the spring's metal ends on top of the brackets. Thread the lifting cables onto the spring. Check the owner's manual included in the spring kit for directions on how to thread the cables. You'll need to slide cable drums onto the ends of the spring, then thread the cables through the hinges down to the brackets on the lower door panel. Hold the torsion bar still with locking pliers. Clamp pliers on the metal ends of the torsion spring. This will prevent the spring from turning as you add tension to it. Turn the spring with a drill to wind it. Look for a raised piece with a hole at one end of the torsion bar. Stick the end of a drill inside it and turn on the drill to add tension. Look for a painted line on the spring, which shows you when it's time to stop winding. Winding the spring too tight can cause it to break, resulting in injury. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions. Lubricate the spring. It helps to slide cardboard or another surface behind the spring to protect the garage. When that's done, spray the spring with a garage door lubricant. Then you're ready to remove the pliers and test the door. Install the garage door opener. To install the opener, you'll need to hang another angle iron from the center joist on your garage's ceiling. Follow the included instructions to hook up the opener and fasten it to the spring system with a pulley and cable. Garage door openers come in several varieties.
