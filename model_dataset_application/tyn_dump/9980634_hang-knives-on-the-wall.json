There should be enough space for you to select a knife without knocking over any others. Popular areas to hang knives are over the sink, above the stove, or on the backsplash behind your counter. Keep the knife strip out of reach of children. Purchase a magnetic knife strip. Find a magnetic strip large enough to hold all of your knives or buy 2 shorter strips to split your knives into separate rows. Knife strips can be purchased at specialty kitchen stores or online. Use a level to mark the wall where you\u2019ll hang the strip. Make an initial mark on your wall where you want one end of the knife strip.

Keep them in size order so you can easily find the correct place to return the knives after they\u2019ve been cleaned. When removing the knife, pull the handle straight so the tip of the blade doesn\u2019t stab into the wall. Making a Mounted Knife Box Measure the length of your longest knife to determine the height of the board. Take the measurement from where the blade and the handle meet to the tip of the blade. You want to purchase a wooden board that\u2019s \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) longer than the blade so it does not hang out of the bottom. Purchase a board that\u2019s at least \u20442 inch (13 mm) thick, but no thicker than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Determine the length of the board by measuring the widths of all your knife blades. Use a ruler or tape measure the widest part of each blade. Add \u20444 inch (6.4 mm) to each measurement to account for the space between slots. Then, add all the measurements together to find out how long the board should be. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the final measurement to account for the side pieces of vinyl. Iron 3 layers of veneer edging to the left and right sides of the board. Edging is usually used to hide the exposed sides of plywood, but here you will use it to build slots for the knives. Use thin veneer edging that has heat-activated glue on the back. Cut the edging with scissors so it is the same height as the board. Use an iron on low to attach the first layer to the main board. Repeat the process for 2 more layers. Veneer edging can be purchased at any home improvement store. It will come in a roll. Lay the largest knife on the board and mark the widest part of the blade. Use a pencil to mark the widest point. This point is usually at the base of the blade, but some knives may have a curve to them. Leave \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) of wiggle room so you do not damage the sharp edge of the blade. Remove the knife once you make the measurement so it\u2019s easier to work. Iron the edging onto the mark. Line up the edging with the pencil mark you\u2019ve made, making sure it lays straight and not at an angle. Iron on 3 layers of edging so that it\u2019s flush with the sides of the board. The slots you make will not only keep your knife blades sharp, but it will also hold them in place so they are easy to grab. Repeat the process for each of your knives. One by one, lay your knives on the board and measure the widest part of the blade. Add the edging in between each blade so you have specific slots for each individual knife. Attach lattice to the top, middle, and bottom of the rack with glue dots. Lattice moulding is wooden trim that can be purchased at any hardware store. Use glue dots on the ends of the moulding board. Attach a piece of moulding to the top and the bottom of the board so they are flush with the edges. Add one more board to the middle so the knives don\u2019t slip out. Alternatively, you can use wood glue and clamps to adhere the lattice, though this is a messier and more time-consuming option. Put adhesive mounting strips on the back of the rack. The rack can be stood up against the wall on the counter, but if you want to adhere it to the wall, attach at least 4 Command strips in the corners of the board. Since this knife rack is solid wood, you may want to purchase extra-strength mounting strips or place a few extra in the middle of the rack. Affix the rack to the wall and place the knives in their slots. Press the mounting strips onto the wall so they adhere firmly to the wall. Hold it against the wall for 60 seconds.
