Put a microfiber towel that\u2019s large enough to cover the burnt area in the bowl and let it soak until it\u2019s completely saturated. You may need to use multiple towels if you need to cover the entire stove top."

Allow the towel to soak the baking soda for at least 15 minutes to help break down the residue. Baking soda breaks down dirt and oil when it reacts with water, so it works great as a natural cleaner. You may leave the towel on the stove top for up to 30 minutes for more difficult stains or residue."

Start in the middle of the burnt area with a cloth scrubbing pad, working in circular motions out toward the edges. Apply slight pressure as you scrub to help lift the stains easier. You may also use a microfiber cloth or paper towel if you don\u2019t have a scrubbing pad.Tip: Avoid using steel wool since you could leave scratches and damage the ceramic."

Continue working across the surface of the stove, replacing the paper towel whenever it gets too wet or soiled. Clean off any leftover streaks with a dry paper towel. If you weren\u2019t able to clean the burnt area completely, you may need to try using baking soda again. If that doesn\u2019t work, you may need a stronger cleaner. Spray glass cleaner on the stove and wipe it off with a paper towel if it still has a cloudy appearance."
