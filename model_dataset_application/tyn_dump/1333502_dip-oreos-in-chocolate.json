          "description":"Chocolate melts more easily if it\u2019s cut into pieces rather than in a solid block. Use a sharp knife to roughly chop the chocolate of your choice into pieces. Place the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. You can use good quality milk, dark, semisweet, bittersweet, or even white chocolate to dip your Oreos in. You may find it easier to use candy melts to coat your Oreos. They are chocolate discs that are made to melt easily, and come in a wide array of flavors and colors so you can create dipped Oreos for holidays and special occasions. Chocolate chips also work well for dipped Oreos because you don\u2019t have worry about chopping them beforehand."

Stirring the chocolate after each 30-second period in the microwave is important. The chocolate can sometimes still look lumpy until you give it a good stir and it smoothes out.

Stir the mixture well until the butter is fully incorporated and the chocolate has a smooth, even consistency. Adding the butter is optional. It helps thin out the chocolate so it coats the cookies more evenly. If your chocolate mixture appears thin enough to cover the Oreos on its own, you can omit the butter if you like. You can flavor the melted chocolate. For example, mix in \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 ml) of peppermint extract into the chocolate for minty dipped Oreos."

The easiest way to dip the cookies into the chocolate without getting your hands dirty is to sandwich one between two forks and carefully lower it into the melted chocolate until it is fully coated. Set the dipped cookies on the lined baking sheet. The melted chocolate shouldn\u2019t be too hot or too cold when you dip the cookies. If it\u2019s too hot, it will slide right off the Oreos. If it\u2019s too cold, it will create a lumpy, uneven coat around the cookies. If the chocolate starts to thicken up as you\u2019re dipping the cookies, reheat it in the microwave in 10-second intervals until it\u2019s the right consistency once more. Be sure to tap the forks against the side of the bowl before placing it on the baking sheet. That will knock off any excess chocolate that might create bumps on the Oreos as they cool. When the chocolate is still soft on the Oreos, you can add toppings if you\u2019d like. For example, you might sprinkle chopped nuts, sprinkles, sea salt, or crushed peppermint candies on the dipped cookies."
