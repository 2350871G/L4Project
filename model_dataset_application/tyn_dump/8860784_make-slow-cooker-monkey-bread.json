  "text":" Making Cinnamon Monkey Bread from Scratch Line your cooker with parchment paper. Spray a light coating of nonstick cooking spray onto the parchment paper. Proof the yeast in sugar and warm water. Heat the water in a saucepan or microwave to about 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C). Mix in the yeast and 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar. Allow it to sit for about five minutes. The mixture is ready once it\u2019s foamy and the yeast is dissolved. Combine the dough ingredients. Add 2 cups (240 g) of the flour, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar, salt, the yeast mixture, 1/4 cup (60 g) melted butter, vanilla, and milk warmed to about 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C). Mix the dough. Use a large bowl and mixing spoon, or a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment. Mix with the spoon or on low speed for ten to fifteen minutes, until the mixture becomes a soft dough. When the dough is finished mixing, it should be soft without sticking to the sides of the bowl. Take out the dough and allow it to rest. Dust a clean work surface lightly with flour. Let the dough rest on the floured surface for about ten minutes. Put the topping ingredients in two small bowls. In one bowl, melt 3/4 cup (180 g) butter. In the other bowl, combine the brown sugar, a cup (200 g) of white sugar, and cinnamon. Form and coat the dough balls. Pinch off 2 tablespoons (30 g) of dough at a time. Roll each piece in your hands to shape it into a ball. Dip the ball in the melted butter, then roll it in the sugar mixture to coat it evenly. Place the ball on the parchment paper in the bottom of the slow cooker. The dough balls can be stacked; a single layer isn\u2019t necessary. Repeat this step until you\u2019ve used all of the dough. Cook the dough on high heat for two hours. Put a double layer of paper towels beneath the lid. This will prevent condensation from dripping onto the dough. Serve and/or store the monkey bread. Turn off the slow cooker. Take the bread out by carefully lifting it along with the parchment paper. Alternately, you can dump it upside-down onto a serving platter. The bread will taste best the day it\u2019s made, but you can store it in an airtight container for up to five days in the refrigerator. Making Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Store-Bought Dough Combine the sugars with cinnamon. Add the ingredients to a large, resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag securely. Shake the bag to mix the sugars and cinnamon together. Coat pieces of biscuit in butter and the cinnamon mixture. Slice each biscuit into fourths, and melt 1/2 cup (120 g) of butter in a bowl. Dip each piece in melted butter, then put it into the bag with the cinnamon mixture. Once you\u2019ve done this with all of the dough, close the bag. Shake the bag until the pieces are coated with the cinnamon and sugar. Arrange the dough in a greased slow cooker. Spray a light coating of nonstick cooking spray in the bottom of the slow cooker. Place the pieces of dough in the bottom of the cooker. They can touch each other, but try to keep them in a single layer rather than stacked. Cook the dough on high for two to three hours. Put a lid on the slow cooker. Once the biscuits are done, switch the heat to warm until you\u2019re ready to serve them, or serve them right away. Make the icing. Melt 1/2 cup (120 g) of butter in a saucepan. Slowly add the powdered sugar, stirring constantly. Cook until the icing is thick and smooth. Stir in the vanilla. Serve monkey bread as soon as possible. Drizzle icing over the bread with a spoon. Keep the bread warm until you serve it.
