To do this, press the metal lip on the right angle where your vinyl plank ends and pull on your tape measure. Pull it towards the location where you want to make your cut and measure the necessary length by checking the measurements printed on the tape. You can use a foldable ruler instead of a measuring tape if you\u2019d like. Foldable rulers are good for measuring cuts because they snap into place to create a straight edge."

Press the flared base against the bottom of the plank and hold it in place by applying a little pressure. To change the location of your angle, simply slide it across the bottom of your vinyl plank. A framing square is sometimes called a carpenter square."

You can make small indicating marks or draw the entire line, based on your personal preferences. If your vinyl plank is darker in color, you probably won\u2019t be able to use a carpentry pencil.

This is the preferred method if you want to control your cut, since you have the most freedom to move the blade cutting the board. You can use a circular saw if you\u2019d like, but the base plate is probably too big for a standard vinyl plank. Circular saws also have issues with kickback when working with thinner materials.
