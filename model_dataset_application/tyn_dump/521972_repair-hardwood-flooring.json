Drill the holes \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) deep so that you don\u2019t drill into the subfloor under your hardwood flooring.

Position the circular saw over one of the holes that you drilled. Hold the saw by the handle and press the trigger to engage the blade. Push the saw down the length of the board until you reach the hole on the opposite end of the board. Repeat this process on all of the holes you drilled. If you don't have a circular saw, you can rent one from a hardware store. These relief cuts will make it easier to pull out the boards.

    "Measure the empty space with a tape measure and use a circular saw or table saw to cut the replacement board so that it fits in the empty space.",
    "If you have boards that are the same size as your previous boards, cutting may not be required.",
    "Squeeze wood glue on top of the subfloor.",
    "Purchase wood glue from a hardware store or online.",
    "Squeeze the tube in a squiggly motion over the top of the subfloor.",

    "Let the glue dry overnight.",
    "Take a final look at the replacement boards and make any final adjustments to them before they dry.",
    "Don\u2019t walk on top of the new boards for 24 hours so that the glue can fully dry and the new boards can set in place.",
    "Refinishing Hardwood Floors Pour a small amount of water on the floor to see if it needs refinishing.",
    "See whether the boards absorb the water that you pour on them.",
    "If the water pools on top of the floor, it\u2019s likely that your floor just needs to be cleaned.",
    "If the water droplets are absorbed by the boards, it means that the finish has worn off and that your floors should be refinished.",
    "Wipe the floor dry after you conduct this test.",
    "Test different sections of the floor to see if the finish has worn off on any part of the floor.",
    "Clear the room of furniture and cover all fixtures.",

    "Rent or purchase a buffing machine from a hardware store.",
    "Start in one section of the room and swing the buffer left to right, going over each area of floor 2-3 times.",
    "Move the buffer down the length of the floor and then work your way back up the room, overlapping the initial buffing 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm).",
    "Continue to do this until you've buffed the entire floor.",
    "Buffing the old finish will turn it into powder, so you\u2019ll know which areas you\u2019ve already gone over.",
    "Buffing the hardwood will smooth the floor and will help the polyurethane adhere to it.",
    "Vacuum the floor.",

    "Oil-based polyurethane has a yellow hue that darkens over time and dries slower than water-based polyurethane.",
    "Let the finish dry for 4-8 hours.",
    "Water-based polyurethane will take around 4 hours to dry before you can apply a second coat.",
    "Oil-based variations typically take around 8 hours to dry.",
    "Look on the polyurethane label to determine the exact drying time for what you're using.",
    "If you have pets, remember to lock them in a room so that they don\u2019t walk over your newly applied finish.",

    "Let the floor air dry or wipe it down with a clean rag or sponge.",
    "Sweep and mop the floor at least once a week to properly maintain it.",
    "Wipe down minor scratches with apple cider vinegar and olive oil.",

    "Wood filler is a better solution for cracks that are deeper than 1 inch (2.5 cm) rather than superficial scratches.",
    "You can darken the wood filler with a blending pencil or stain filler once it has dried.",
    "Use area rugs and doormats to prevent scratches from occurring.",
    "Encourage people to wipe their shoes off on rugs and doormats to prevent dirt and small stones from getting onto the surface of your floor and scratching it.",
