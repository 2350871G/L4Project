  "text":" Standard Queen Bed Purchase all the gear you need. See the \"Things You'll Need\" list below for specific details. The goal is to build a frame that will fit a queen-size mattress (60\" wide x 80\" long). Beyond that, you'll need to visit your local home improvement warehouse to acquire three basic things:\nBed rail hangers\nWood\nWood screws Mount the bed rail hangers. This hardware is essential in forming a rigid connection between all the bed rails in the frame. Secure the bed rail hangers to the end of the side-rail and head post. Double check that each placement is consistent. Repeat the process for all corners. These hangers can sometimes be hard to find in hardware stores. If so, check online retailers. Bed rail hangers are usually sold 4 sets to a package. In the place of bed rail hangers, you can use 8 long lag bolts. When tightened, the lag bolts make the bed very solid. Lag bolts are also much easier to find than bed rail hangers. Attach the support rails. Screw the support rail to each side rail. Make sure to space the screws about 12\" (30.5 cm) apart. This provides maximum weight support. Create the support blocks. Cut a groove into the support block and support beam, as shown. This groove should be a centered 1.5\"x 3.5\" slot, with the wider measurement following the wider part of the block. Attach the support blocks. Attach each support block to the center of the head rail and foot rail with screws as shown in the image. Connect the rails. Connect each rail to the post using the bedrail hangers. Add the support beams. Insert the support beam between the two support blocks. Insert your plywood mattress surface. Rest the plywood on the support rails and support beam. It should fit into the inner part of the bed frame. Once this is done, the mattress can be placed in the frame. Finished. Enjoy your new bed! Platform Bed Gather your materials and supplies. You'll need a circular saw, a number of basic L brackets, 3\" decking screws, some MDF or plywood, and then several cuts of lumber. For lumber, you'll need:\nTwo pieces of 85\" 2x4\nFive pieces of 67\" 2x4\nEight pieces of 19 3/8 2x4\nTwo pieces of 75\" 2x12\nFour pieces of 57\" 2x12 Create the base frame. Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 75\" 2x12s and two of the 57\" 2x12s into a  60\"x75\" box. Add the base bracers. Slide in the remaining 57\" 2x12s, space the box into thirds, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place. Set aside the completed base. Create the platform frame. Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 85\" 2x4s and two of the 67\" 2x4s into a 70\"x85\" box. Add the platform bracers. Slide in the remaining 67\" 2x4s, space the box into 4 sections, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place. Add the platform supports. You will now add the 19 3/8\" 2x4s between the bracers, two to a section. Space them evenly but stagger them, so that the leftmost and second right most sections have the supports at the same level and the rightmost and second leftmost have the supports at the same level. Attach these with decking screws as well. Reinforce the corners and joints. Reinforce the inside corners of both the base and platform with L brackets. You can also add L brackets around some of the other interior joints as well for added strength. Add the plywood surface. Trace and cut plywood to fit the surface of the platform. This will likely take two pieces of plywood to cover. Attach the plywood with decking screws to the inside bracers, such that the screws won't show on the exposed platform. Paint the bed. Sand the wood and then paint or stain the bed to the desired color. Done! Arrange the platform on top of the base in the final location.
