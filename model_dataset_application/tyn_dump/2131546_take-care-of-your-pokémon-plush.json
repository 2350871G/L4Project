      "description":"Depending on your Pok\u00e9mon and type, they will live in different habitats, Bulbasaur for example, lives in a grassland, but Charmander lives in the mountains, and Pikachu just likes the forest, or a barn.You want your plush to feel at home, right? Regardless of habitat you will need a big box (cardboard, plastic, anything as long as it's a box that they will fit and there is at least 6 inches of room for furniture or d\u00e9cor). You can also design a cozy house, or just a bed. The bed has to have a mattress, blanket, and pillow. For grassland you could use ribbon or green string as grass. Or for the mountains Styrofoam like snow, but other methods recommend are things like paint and model magic or other air-dry clay that you could spike or create designs in if you want them in a house instead of their natural habitat."

Your Pok\u00e9mon's type will tell, for fire types (like Fennekin, Typhlosion, and Litten), keep them by a fireplace or a window where the sun shines through, keep a fan or air conditioning on them if they are ice types (like Vanillite), next to the sink filled with water, a bucket of water, or a pool if you have one for water types (like Froakie, Oshawott, or Popplio). The garage or a place with lots of steel for steel types (like Beldum), near an electric socket or a window in a thunderstorm with lightning for electric types (like Pikachu, Pachirisu, Emolga, Electrike, or Dedenne) take them to the gym on occasions for fighting types (like Hariyama), bug types (like Caterpie or Parasect) and grass types (like Snivy or Rowlet) will enjoy being kept near plants, and normal or fairy types depend. Keep Munchlax in the kitchen, or Jigglypuff next to your karaoke system (because Jigglypuff is excellent at singing)."

      "headline":"Provide food.",
      "description":"Food is a large matter here, whether you choose real food or just play food for dolls and things it won't matter. For real food let them have dinner with you, only when no one is watching. You can also take things like brown Beados on a spoon and feed them Pok\u00e9mon food. They might enjoy some Poffins with you. Poffins can be sugar cookies, dinner rolls, etc. Rare candy can be bought at stores in the shape of gumballs or chocolate balls, or you can pretend that you found new rare candy that is a gummy bear or some Smarties. PokePuffs (found as cake balls, cream puffs, or donut holes) and Pokeblocks (as Jolly Rancher candy) are great, too!"

You can be strict like A.J. in the episode of the anime The Path to the Pok\u00e9mon League or you can choose to be like Ash, he is friends with his Pok\u00e9mon but does have his requirements, or yet just completely soft, they don't battle, they are low levels except for friendship, and etc."

If you bring them into a store make sure that they don't sell that plush there; otherwise someone might report you for stealing it from that store, and don't ever put them down for a second. Try putting them in a backpack with their head poking out, or in a purse, but ALWAYS check that they are still there in case they fall out. Only bring it to school on show and tell, and only have it out of your backpack when your teacher says so, you don't want them taken away now do you?"

Repeat when dirty, but if it has fuzz like Cyndaquil's fire then its not a good idea to machine wash."

Take them outside to play, use some rope to take them on a walk, have sleepovers every now and then if you prefer to keep your Pok\u00e9mon in its habitat at night. Read a book, or my favorite, watch a Pok\u00e9mon episode all about that Pok\u00e9mon. If you get a new Pok\u00e9mon or stuffed animal that you care more about, then still play with the old Pok\u00e9mon plush now and then, and if you are done with them forever, give them to another loving family or to a friend to watch them from now on."
