          "description":"Since you\u2019re using tracing paper to trace your photograph, it is important that you can see the lines and colors of the image through the paper. An image that has distinct lines will show through the thin paper and allow you to trace it more easily. Avoid images that have small or blurry details that might not show through the paper. Remember that because you are tracing the image, your final product will be a replica of the photograph; if you want your final product to be a certain size, make sure you size the photograph appropriately (you can size it on a computer and reprint it) before tracing."

          "headline":"Tape each corner of the photograph to your drawing surface using artist tape.",
          "description":"Choose the location you want to draw on, and use artist tape to secure your image. Artist tape will hold the photograph still while you trace and will easily peel away without tearing the photo or leaving any residue. You can use an ordinary table as a surface to trace a photograph, but you might be more comfortable if you tape the photograph to a drawing board and adjust the drawing angle to your liking. Consider buying a small tracing lightbox and taping your photograph to the glass. The lightbox will shine a light against the back of the photograph, making the image easier to trace. You could also try taping the photograph to a sunny window, allowing more light to shine through the image."

          "headline":"Tape a sheet of tracing paper over the photograph.",
          "description":"Tracing paper often comes in rolls, so cut the correct size of paper based on the size of your photograph. You want to make sure it is at least the same size, if not larger. Hold the paper over the photo with one hand and smooth it with the other, so that it is taut as you tape the edges. Use artist tape to tape each corner of the tracing paper over the photograph. Tracing paper is a really thin type of paper that is easy to see through. Generic tracing paper from your local art supply store will work perfectly."

Fewer details will give the tracing a cartoon-like, or abstract, appearance while copying all the details of the photograph will result in a realistic copy. Once you have traced the photograph, you can get creative and add any colors or additions that you want."

Move slowly and gently as you remove the tape so you don\u2019t damage the delicate tracing paper. Remove the tape from the photograph as well. Try pulling off the tape slowly at a 90-degree angle to avoid tearing the paper."
