Hold the guitar in your lap or lay it flat on a clean surface. Make sure the strings are facing up so you can access all of them easily.

Start with the \u201cE\u201d string, which is the thickest string at the top. Play the string as you turn the tuning head to make sure you\u2019re loosening it. The sound will get deeper as the tension is released. Continue rotating until the string no longer makes a sound when you play it.Don\u2019t loosen the string so much that it hangs over the next string. If the note that the string makes when you play it gets higher, then you\u2019re rotating the tuning head in the wrong direction."
