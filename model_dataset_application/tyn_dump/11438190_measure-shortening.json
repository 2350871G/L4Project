If you add too much shortening to the scale, you can use the spoon to scoop a bit back into the shortening container until you get the right amount. Once you\u2019re done scooping the shortening, place the spoon in the dishwasher or soak it in hot water to start breaking down the shortening residue."

This method is effective for measuring shortening because the water fills any air pockets, eliminating the need for you to pack down the shortening.
