A normal household battery won\u2019t provide enough power to light these larger types of bulbs up. You can use a small LED bulb from a flashlight, for example. To power a higher voltage light bulb, you would need to string together multiple batteries of 12V or higher, which isn\u2019t safe to do for this experiment as you could get an electrical shock.The instructions below are for LED bulbs.If you follow those steps using a regular LED, remember they are polarized. Always connect the longest leg to the positive terminal of the battery and the shortest leg to the negative terminal. Else the LED won't light or could be damaged. Do not use a battery with a voltage over 3V, else your LED might explode."

          "description":"Set a household battery and your LED bulb on a flat work surface. Place 1 end of a copper electrical wire against 1 of the battery\u2019s terminals and tape it in place with electrical tape. Tape the other end of the wire to the bottom of the LED bulb.Tip: If you want to make a more permanent connection, you can solder the wire in place. You can use any standard household battery, such as a AA, AAA, C or D battery, which are all 1.5V batteries. You could also just hold the wire in place if you don\u2019t have any electrical tape to temporarily connect them. There is no risk of getting electrocuted by such a low voltage."

Put the other end against the side of the bulb\u2019s base to light up the LED light and tape it in place if you want to keep the bulb lit. The bulb lights up because you are making a complete electrical circuit between the positive and negative terminals of the battery and the 2 wires that are inside the light bulb\u2019s base. You can also try this experiment with just 1 wire by touching the light bulb directly to 1 of the batteries terminals for 1 of the connections. For example, if you tape an electrical wire between the bottom of the bulb and 1 of the batteries terminal, you can light up the bulb by touching the side of the bulb\u2019s base to the other terminal."

Use an additional electrical wire to connect the side of the toggle switch labelled for accessories to the LED bulb. A toggle switch is an electrical switch with a knob that you can flip back and forth to turn an accessory on and off. It works by blocking or connecting 2 wires in the electrical circuit."

If you choose to add more light bulbs into the circuit, it doesn\u2019t matter which batteries you connect them to. Since all of the batteries are wired together, they essentially work as a single more powerful battery. Keep in mind that if you use too many batteries to power just 1 light bulb, you could blow it out.
