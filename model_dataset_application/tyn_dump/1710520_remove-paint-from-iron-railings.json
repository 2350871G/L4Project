You can dip the brush directly into the stripper or pour the liquid stripper into a paint tray. Apply the chemical stripper to the railing. Spread the liquid stripper to any stubborn paint spots on the iron. You can also brush it over hard-to-reach places on the iron railing. Spread a thick layer of the chemical stripper so it works quickly. Let the chemical stripper sit on the railing for at least 5 minutes. Follow the manufacturer's instructions about how long to let the chemical stripper sit on the metal. In general, leave the stripper on the railing for at least 5 minutes.

Keep scraping so the paint flakes and falls off. If there are still stubborn spots, you can apply more chemical stripper and wait before scraping it off again. Protecting and Repainting the Railings Wipe off the railing with a tack cloth or mineral spirits. To remove fine paint particles, take a tack cloth and rub it over the entire surface of the iron railing. The tack cloth contains a slightly sticky substance that picks up fine particles of paint or metal so the bare iron is ready to paint.
