Printing out Your Stickers Open a new 8 x 11 inch (20.3 x 27.9 cm) document in your image editing software. If the software you're using doesn't let you specify the size when you open a new document, edit the size after you open the document. Look for the size button in your software's menu bar.

Peel back the backing at the top of the over-laminate sheet and line the top edge of the laminate up with the top edge of the vinyl paper. Use your fingers to press the laminate onto the vinyl paper so it sticks. You can find over-laminate online or at your local office supplies store.

Grab a corner of the vinyl backing with two fingers and peel it back until it\u2019s completely off the sticker. Place your sticker on a dry, flat surface.",
