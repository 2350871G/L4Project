          "description":"Most commonly, glasses get stuck together when they are stacked immediately after they are washed. Glass expands when heated, and contracts as it cools, and this is sufficient to stick glasses together in some cases. Never fear: you can use this to separate the glasses. You will need to cool the inner glass and heat the outer glass in order to free them from each other. To avoid this problem in the future, be more careful about stacking glasses. Let glasses cool before you stack them. If you wash with cold water, this should not be a problem."

          "description":"This method carries some risk, so you should use it with care. Since the outer glass is the one that has shrunk around the inner glass, this one needs to expand to allow the inner glass to slip away. Gently heat the outer glass by running it under the hot tap for a minute or so. With any luck, the glasses should come unstuck. If not, you may wish to consider cooling the inner glass, by filling it from the cold tap. Avoid using ice or boiling water. The sudden change in temperature could cause one or both glasses to shatter violently, which could be very dangerous. The glass is already under compression, making the situation especially risky."

Place the glass on a solid, easy-to-clean surface, or hold the base carefully in your hand. Tap the outer glass gently with a hammer, on the rim, until it cracks. There is a risk that you might break both glasses \u2013 but this can be a great last-ditch effort. Afterward, be sure to gather all shards of broken glass. Safety first!"

A bit of olive or sunflower oil may do the trick. Try using soap. This is especially effective if the glasses are \"pinched\" together, rather than stuck fast. Consider using the oil method in conjunction with the heating method. This may be effective on especially stubborn glasses. Try using WD-40 oil as a last-ditch resort. Spray it between the glass. The oil should spread thoroughly by itself, and it should be relatively easy to pull the glasses away from each other.

Twist the glasses in opposite directions to loosen the grip. At the same time, pull them apart with a lesser force. Focus on trying to twist it more than pulling it. If the twisting works, the glass should come off by itself. Don't try to pull the glasses straight off! The force needed to grip the glass could break the glass itself."
