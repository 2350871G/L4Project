Then, make a second cut across the other end of the pepper to remove its bottom. As a rule of thumb, cut the pepper right behind the rounded portions leading to the stem and base."

This will let you unfurl the pepper so you can reach inside of it. If you cut through the entire pepper, you also cut through the seeded part in the center. Preserving that part makes it easier to remove later."

To remove it, cut across the flesh until you are able to pull the core out. Finish by picking out the remaining seeds and scraping off any white ridges still on the pepper\u2019s flesh.

Slide the edge of a knife about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) away from the stem, then slowly work around it until you are able to remove it. If you don\u2019t wish to use the top at the moment, you could always throw it away or save it for another recipe."

Try to keep these strips as even as possible. When you\u2019re done, cut the strips horizontally to turn them into cubes. Remember to cut up the top and bottom portions you removed if you plan on using them. They look different from the rest of the cut pepper, so find a different use for them if the shape or size matters in your dish. They often work well in a sauce or soup."
