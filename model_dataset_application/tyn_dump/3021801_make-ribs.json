Cover your grill. barbecue  for 2 to 4.5 hours. If you want to add more smoke flavor, add wood chips to the barbecue pit. Before adding wood chips (hickory, mesquite and other) soak them in water for an hour, so they smoke rather than burn. Some may choose to place a pan of shallow water below the ribs to add moisture. If you do this, consider using a disposable foil pan, as it will get very messy. This water will help steam your ribs, and may create a \"fall of the bone\" result, but steaming is arguably less flavorful than cooking dry . Oven Bake. Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0 Fahrenheit (150\u00b0 Celsius). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a cooling rack on  the lined baking sheet. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator. Place them on top of the cooling rack with meaty side up. Cook for 1.5 to 2 hours\nIt is recommended that halfway through cooking you place a layer of aluminum foil over the top of the baking sheet.
