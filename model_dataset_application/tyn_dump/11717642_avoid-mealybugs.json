          "description":"Before you buy a plant from a nursery or gardening store, inspect the plant carefully for signs of mealybugs. Look for small, slow-moving insects that are white or light pink. They tend to feed on the tips of stems where the leaf grows, so look for bites or holes near the base of the leaves. Check the main stem and under the leaves for a cotton-like white mold. If a plant has any of these symptoms, mealybugs may be nesting in it and you should not take it home.Tip: You may not physically see any mealybugs. They burrow in the stems and branches of the plant and the male mealybugs are not visible to the naked eye. There may still be mealybugs on a plant, even if you don\u2019t see them. The white moldy material is excretion from the mealybugs. It\u2019s a trademark sign of a particularly bad infestation."

          "description":"As a preventative measure, pick up some horticultural oil. Fill a sprayer or spray bottle with the oil and mist your plants in a thin layer of the solution. Mist the top of the plant, under the leaves, and around the base of the stem to ensure that you cover each section of the plant. This will remove any mealybugs on your plant that you can\u2019t see.Horticultural oil is an excellent natural pesticide. It will not harm your plants but it will suffocate any pests that are already on your plant. One application is typically enough to prevent non-visible infestations from growing. You can apply an additional layer after 7 days if you\u2019d like, though."

Alternatively, you can keep it in a shed or garage next to a window. Inspect your plant daily for signs of mealybugs to ensure that the plant is safe to keep.Mealybug eggs can take months to hatch. It\u2019s not realistic to quarantine your plant for that long, and 1 week is typically long enough for you to recognize signs of adult mealybugs."

If the problem doesn\u2019t look too bad, you can begin addressing the bugs and treating your plant.If you find the mealybugs on an outdoor plant already in your garden, quarantine it. Then, treat the plants that were surrounding the infected plant, even if you don\u2019t see any signs of mealybugs. If mealybugs are infesting a large number of plants in your garden, it\u2019s not worth digging them out and quarantining them. Simply deal with the problem where your plants happen to be."
