Stir the dry ingredients together until they\u2019re evenly distributed. Use the bottom of a spoon or ladle to press a small well into the center of the dry mix to make mixing in the other ingredients easier. Baking powder is optional, but will produce fluffier pancakes that rise better during the cooking process."

Stir the the egg and milk into the dry ingredients, making sure to beat the egg. For a thicker batter, use slightly less milk. Add the milk slowly and gradually while you stir. If the batter comes out thicker than you like, you can always add another ounce. If you use too much, however, you\u2019ll have to add more flour, which will throw the recipe off. Some people also like to add about a teaspoon of oil to the batter itself. This can help the ingredients hold together better once they\u2019ve been mixed."

The batter should be smooth and have a thick, creamy consistency when it\u2019s done. Be careful not to overmix your batter.

While you\u2019re letting the batter rest,  you can begin preparing your cooking surface. Resting the batter gives the starches time to relax after whisking them together so that the pancake will turn out light and fluffy. This is a good time to add other ingredients to your pancake batter, such as chocolate chips, blueberries, coconut, etc."

If you\u2019re using oil to cook pancakes, canola or vegetable oil will work best, as they\u2019ll lubricate the skillet and cook the pancakes evenly without influencing their flavor.
