Abrasive cleaning tools, like steel wool, scouring pads, and pumice stones, will scratch your frosted glass. While it might be tempting to try and scrub the surface with these kinds of tools, it\u2019s much better to use an effective cleaner and a smooth scrubber, like newspaper, paper towels, or a microfiber cloth.Tip: Soap scum and mineral deposits can be hard to see once the glass surface is damp.

In general, wait about 30 minutes and then look to see if the glass is dry and if you were successful at cleaning everything off the surface. While you can wipe the surface dry with a clean, microfiber towel, this can leave behind lint and fibers that get stuck on the textured surface of frosted glass."

In a small dish, mix 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda with 1 cup (240 ml) of water and a squirt of dish-washing soap or vinegar. Use a sponge or towel to apply the mixture to the entire surface of the glass. Let it sit for a few minutes and then scrub the area with newspaper or paper towels. Once you are done scrubbing, rinse the surface with water, spray it down with glass cleaner, and then rinse it again. Use caution when using vinegar since it\u2019s acidic and too much could be abrasive on your frosted glass."
