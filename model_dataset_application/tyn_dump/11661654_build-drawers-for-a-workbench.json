The idea of cutting them it to make sure they slide into the space under the bench while pointing vertically. If the space under your workbench is a length of 30 inches (76 cm), and a height of 40 inches (100 cm), then measure the boards to cover those dimensions. Each board should have the same dimensions, unless the bench is crooked or wasn't built straight. If the plywood boards are too small for the workbench, you can use multiple boards in a row or, if you\u2019re not installing that many drawers, just leave the boards short. If you want to fill all the space under the bench, you can probably fit 2 or 3 columns of drawers that are 6 inches (15 cm) deep and 12 inches (30 cm) wide, although this depends on the size of your workbench."
