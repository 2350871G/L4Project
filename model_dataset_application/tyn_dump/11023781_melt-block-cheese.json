If you want to add any special ingredients to your cheese, place them in the bowl as well. For example, if you want to make a nacho cheese dipping sauce, add a dash of chili powder to the cheese when you put it in the bowl. For best results, shred the cheese with a grater or chop the cheese into 1 in (2.5 cm) cubes before you put it in the bowl. This will speed up the melting process."

          "description":"For every 1 cup (125 grams) of cheese you place in the bowl, add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of cornstarch and 1 cup (240 mL) of evaporated milk to the bowl as well. This will make your melted cheese silky and smooth instead of stringy.Tip: If you don\u2019t have evaporated milk, you can also use ordinary milk. However, this may end up making your melted cheese a lot smoother and less gooey than evaporated milk does."

After about 30 seconds, use a spoon or fork to stir all the contents of the bowl together as needed to get a creamy cheese sauce. Be very careful when touching the sides of the bowl, since it may be very hot when you go to take it out of the microwave."

          "description":"Depending on how many ingredients you placed in the bowl, the cheese may not be completely melted. If this is the case, simply heat it up again for 20-30 seconds or until it has visibly melted to your taste. Once it\u2019s completely melted, remove the bowl from the microwave and serve the cheese. It may take several minutes for your cheese to melt completely, so don\u2019t get frustrated if it doesn\u2019t melt after 1 or 2 tries. Cheese melted in the microwave works great as a cheese sauce you can use for dipping, or for pouring over your favorite snacks!"
