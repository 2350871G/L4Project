  "text":" Fixing a Crack in Drywall Buy prepared joint compound or mix it yourself. If you buy it premade, look for all-purpose compound which can be used for all coats.

Apply multiple coats of concrete patching with a putty knife. Press each layer into the crack and let dry completely in between coats. Repeat until the crack is filled and level with the rest of the wall. You can also use a pointed trowel if you don't have a putty knife. This is good for pushing the patching into the crack.
