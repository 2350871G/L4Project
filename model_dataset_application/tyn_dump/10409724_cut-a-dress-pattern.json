Do not cut along the folded edge of the fabric. Aligning the fabric this way will allow you to cut out a larger piece of fabric and reduce the number of seams on your dress.

If you have purchased the required amount of fabric, you should have plenty of room to place all of the pieces on the pattern. Some pattern pieces may only require you to cut out 1 piece of fabric. Check each paper pattern piece to be sure. Pattern weights are also a good option for holding your pattern pieces on your fabric.
