For four 8-ounce (227 g) candles, you\u2019ll need approximately 6 cups (1419 g) of wax flakes. You can use whatever type of wax you like for the candles, but soy wax tends to absorb fragrance better than beeswax or other waxes."

Turn the burner to medium-low, and allow the wax to melt completely, which should take 3 to 5 minutes. Wax can ignite fairly easily, so watch the pot closely as the wax melts. Be sure to stir the wax with a wooden spoon or chop stick, while it\u2019s heating to break up clumps and ensure that it melts evenly. If you find that it\u2019s taking longer than 5 minutes or so for the wax to melt, turn the heat up to medium."

Place a small dab of glue from a hot glue gun on the bottom of the wick, and drop it down into the center of the jar. Allow the glue to set for several minutes before pouring the hot wax into the jar. If you don\u2019t have a hot glue gun, you can also dab the bottom of the wicks with a small amount of melted wax, drop it down into the jar, and allow it to set for several minutes.

The amount of essential oil depends on how potent the oil(s) you\u2019re using are and how strongly scented you want your candles to be, but 80 to 100 drops is a  good number to start with. Stir the oil(s) into the wax well to ensure that it\u2019s well combined. If you want extremely fragrant candles, you may want to add more than 100 drops. Experiment to see what the right amount is. You can use a single oil or mix two or more types of essential oils to create custom scents for your candles. You can also purchase fragrance oils designed specifically for making candles. They come in a wide variety of scents, including specialty fragrances, such as Christmas Cookie or Fresh Cut Grass."

Fill each jar in the same way. Depending on the size of the jars and how much you fill them, you may have some wax left over.
