          "description":"A Skip-Bo deck has a total of 144 cards numbered 1 to 12 and 16 \"skip-bo\" cards, which are wild. Each player is dealt a pile 10 to 30 cards, depending on the number of players. Each player's pile of cards is called a stockpile. The point of Skip-Bo is to play every card in your stockpile in numerical order. The first person to play every card in their pile is the winner. Even though the cards are multi-colored in Skip-Bo, these colors are irrelevant. All you need to worry about is the number on the cards."

          "description":"Aside from each player's stockpile, there are three other types of piles used for three different purposes. However, it is important to understand how each one works before you start playing the game. After all of the cards have been dealt, place the remaining cards in the middle of the players. This is called the draw pile. Each player will draw from this pile at the beginning of their turn, and use the cards to create building piles. When play begins, players start getting rid of their cards by making building piles in the middle of the table. There are four building piles, and each one must start with either a 1 or a Skip-Bo card. At the end of each turn, players discard a card into a discard pile. Each player can have up to four discard piles, and the cards in these piles should be facing up. The cards in the discard piles can be used in succeeding turns to add to the build piles."

          "description":"Throughout the game, the goal is to get rid of all of your cards as quickly as possible by putting them into building piles. The first person to play every card in his or her stockpile wins the game. You can strategize against other players by preventing them from getting rid of their cards more quickly than you get rid of yours. Since you can see what cards other players have in their discard piles, you can play cards that will block them from being able to play these cards. You'll get rid of your cards faster if you play the cards from your stockpile before playing those in your discard pile."

          "description":"Keeping score while playing Skip-Bo is optional, but it can be a great way to extend the game to multiple rounds. To keep score, have each player count their remaining cards at the end of the game and multiply this number by 5. The winning player gets these points plus 25 for winning the game. The first player to reach 500 points wins. 500 points is just a starting point recommended for score keeping, but you can go for a higher number if you want to play more rounds."

To play in teams, follow the same rules as normal Skip-Bo, but you can use your teammate\u2019s discard piles to help you with your turn. Divide your total players evenly to play in teams. For example, if four people are playing, then you could play in teams of two."

That way everyone has room for their stockpile and four discard piles, and there's room in the middle of the table for the draw pile and four building piles.

Whoever is sitting to the left of the dealer is usually who goes first in Skip-Bo. However, if you prefer to have the youngest player go first, or choose another method of picking who will go first, then you can do that. Flip over your top stockpile card. Begin your first turn by flipping over the top card in your stockpile. Everyone will start their first turn in the same manner. Draw five cards. Next, draw five cards from the draw pile. You will always need to have a hand of five cards at the beginning of your turn, so you may need to draw between one and five cards every turn. Check your hand. After you have revealed your stockpile card and you have five cards in your hand, then you can examine your cards to see if you can add to a build pile.
