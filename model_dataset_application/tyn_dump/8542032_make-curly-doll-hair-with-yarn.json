If your doll is made from cloth, or any other material, you will have to crochet a wig cap for the doll first, follow this method, then attach the wig cap. Wrap the yarn tightly around a thin dowel.

Make a loop with the yarn, overlapping the working and tail ends. Pull the working end of the yarn through the middle of the ring. Pull it up towards the top edge of the ring and make a chain stitch. Do your first round in the magic ring. Make six single crochets in the magic ring. Finish with a slip stitch in the first single crochet. Gently tug on the tail to tighten the stitches. Start your second round. Chain stitch two. Do two half-double-crochets in each stitch. When you reach the end of the round, close it with a slip stitch in your first half-double-crochet.

Next, do a half-double-crochet in each stitch over the next two stitches. (This is your increase). Follow it up with two half-double-crochets in the third stitch. Do this six times, then close the round with a slip stitch in the first half-double-crochet. Make your third increase for the fifth round. Start with two chain stitches. Next, do a half-double-crochet in each stitch over the next three stitches. (This is your increase). Follow it with two half-double-crochets in the fourth stitch. Do this six times. Close the round with a slip stitch in the first half double crochet. Continue making increases until your wig cap is one round away from being the right size. The wig cap needs to be big enough to fit over your doll's head and extend from hairline to hairline. Finish off with a half, increasing round. Start with two chain stitches, then 2 half-double-crochets in the first stitch. Continue where you left off with your increases: a half-double-crochet in each stitch. Instead of going for the entire round, stop when you are half-way across. Finish off with a slip stitch in the next stitch, then cut your yarn and tie it off. You will be left with something that looks like a cap, but that is longer on one end. This longer end goes on the front of the doll's head. The shorter end goes on the back.",

    "Making a Crochet Wig Cap (Optional) Make a crochet wig cap if you do not have a crochet or amigurumi doll.",

    "Start a magic ring.",
    "Make a loop with the yarn, overlapping the working and tail ends.",
    "Pull the working end of the yarn through the middle of the ring.",
    "Pull it up towards the top edge of the ring and make a chain stitch.",

    "Start your third round with two chain stitches.",
    "Next, do a half-double-crochet in the next stitch, followed by two half-double-crochets in the second stitch.",
    "Do this six times, then close the round with a slip stitch in the first half-double-crochet.",
    "Make your second increase for the fourth round.",
    "Start with two chain stitches.",
    "Next, do a half-double-crochet in each stitch over the next two stitches.",
    "(This is your increase).",
    "Follow it up with two half-double-crochets in the third stitch.",

    "Finish off with a half, increasing round.",
    "Start with two chain stitches, then 2 half-double-crochets in the first stitch.",
    "Continue where you left off with your increases: a half-double-crochet in each stitch.",
    "Instead of going for the entire round, stop when you are half-way across.",
    "Finish off with a slip stitch in the next stitch, then cut your yarn and tie it off.",
    "You will be left with something that looks like a cap, but that is longer on one end.",
    "This longer end goes on the front of the doll's head.",
    "The shorter end goes on the back."
