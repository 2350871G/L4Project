Measure each of your wooden components carefully before you make any cuts. Use naturally water-resistant woods like cedar and redwood to encourage drainage and prevent overwatering the plants. The addition of a deep shadowbox will provide adequate room to contain the potting soil and roots of the plants, while also giving your living picture a more commanding three-dimensional appearance."

You can also add a small amount of fertilizer to the potting soil to promote the health of new plants.

This will create a series of small holes that will make planting the seeds and cuttings much more expedient. Dig one hole for each plant you intend to grow. Make sure the holes are relatively narrow and that the soil around the opening isn\u2019t cracked or loose. Be careful not to make the holes so deep that you reach the plywood backing. Confirm that the holes you dig are wide enough to accommodate the root bulbs of larger succulent species."

  "text":" Assembling the Frame Gather your supplies. To put together your own living picture, you\u2019ll need an old or unused portrait frame, four 1x3 boards, a sheet of \u00bd\u201c hardware cloth, a scrap piece of plywood, a hammer, nails and wood staples.
