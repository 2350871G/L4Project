Sew the hole closed. Thread the tail of yarn through a yarn needle. Pinch the opening together, then whip stitch it closed. Part Two: Paws Attach new yarn to your crochet hook. Use a slipknot to tie the yarn onto the hook. Leave a starting tail of 4 inches (10 cm) or so. Chain three. Create a foundation chain of three chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Single crochet the paw shape. Single crochet once into the second chain from the hook, then once into the chain after that. This should produce a rounded triangular shape. Each paw consists of nothing more than this flat triangle of yarn. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving a 4 inch (10 cm) tail. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook to knot it. Do not trim this tail. It will be used later on to help attach the paw to the body. Create three more paws. Follow the same steps outlined above to create three more identical paws. Set the paws aside until you are ready to assemble the final animal. Part Three: Ears Attach the yarn to your hook. Use a slipknot to attach a fresh piece of yarn to your crochet hook. Leave a 4 inch (10 cm) starting tail. Chain two. Create a foundation chain of two chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Single crochet three times. Work each single crochet into the first chain of your foundation. This should form a small, circular ear piece. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving a 4 inch (10 cm) tail. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook to finish the ear off. Make another ear. Follow the same steps to produce a second ear. Set both ears aside until you are ready to assemble the entire stuffed animal. Attach the yarn to the hook. Use a basic slipknot to attach the yarn to your crochet hook. Leave a starting tail roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long. Chain two. Create a foundation of two chain stitches from the slipknot loop on your hook. Single crochet six times. Work six single crochets into the first chain of your foundation. This should give you a round with six stitches in it. Single crochet increase for another two rounds. Increase the stitch count by two single crochets as you create rounds two and three. For round two, single crochet once into each of the next two stitches. Single crochet twice into the stitch after that; repeat twice, giving you a final stitch count of 10. For round three, single crochet once into each of the next three stitches. Single crochet twice into the stitch after that; repeat twice, giving you a final stitch count of 12. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving a tail that measures 4 inches (10 cm) long. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook to knot it. Make a second ear. Follow the same steps to create a second ear that is identical to the first. Set both ears aside until you are ready to assemble the entire cat. Attach the yarn to the hook. Use a slipknot to tie a fresh piece of yarn onto the hook. Leave a starting tail of 4 inches (10 cm) or so. Chain two. Work a small foundation of two chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Single crochet six times. Work six single crochet into the first chain of your foundation. This should create a small, bulky circle. Increase around the second round. Single crochet twice into each stitch of the first round. You should be left with 12 stitches at the completion of this round. Single crochet another eight rounds. Single crochet once into each stitch of the previous round. Repeat this step to complete rounds three through ten. Each round should have 12 stitches. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving a 4 inch (10 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot it. Make a second ear. Repeat the same steps to create a second identical ear for the dog. Flatten each ear in between your two fingers. When you attach the ear to the head of the dog, you will position the open end flat against the head and stitch both sides of the opening in place. Set both ears aside until you are ready to attach them to the body. Part Four: Tail Attach the yarn to the hook. Use a slipknot to attach a new piece of yarn to the crochet hook. Leave a starting tail roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long. Chain two. Create a foundation of two chain stitches, working them off the loop on your hook. Single crochet six times. Work six single crochet into the first chain of your foundation. Doing this should produce a bulky circle. Join the ends of the circle. Slip stitch the first and last stitch of the circle together to close it off. Fasten off the yarn. Snip the yarn so that a 4 inch (10 cm) tail remains and pull the tail through the loop on your hook. This should be enough the finish off the tailpiece. Knot the yarn onto the hook. Use a slipknot to attach the yarn to your crochet hook. Leave a starting chain roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long. Chain four to nine stitches. Work a strand of four to nine chain stitches from the loop already on your hook. Use four chain stitches for a dog's tail or nine chain stitches for a cat's tail. This tail is very simple and consists only of this one chain. You can make the tail longer or shorter as desired by working more or fewer chain stitches. Secure the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving a 3 inch (7.6 cm) tail. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. After knotting the chain, you may want to trim the excess or weave it into the stitches. You'll use the starting yarn tail to attach this tailpiece to the body of the cat or dog. Part Five: Assembly Create a small felt nose. Cut a small oval or triangle out of black felt to create a nose for the stuffed animal. The nose should be about 1/5 inch (5 mm) long. You can change the color of the felt as desired to match the yarn color used for the body of the stuffed animal. Create two felt eyes. Cut two small felt circles from black felt to make two eyes. These felt circles should be slightly larger than the one created for the nose. You can change the color of the felt if desired. The exact size of the eyes should be a matter of preference, but they can range be anywhere from the same size as the nose to a size twice as large. Sew on the ears. Place the ears on the top of the body, keeping them even with one another. Use the yarn needle and excess yarn tails to whip stitch them into place. Bear and cat ears should rest between the second and fourth rows of the body. Dog ears should rest below fifth or sixth round of the body and should be positioned so that they extend from the sides of the head, rather than sticking up from the top. Note that the top of the body is the end opposite the whip stitched portion of the body. Attach the tail. Place the tail three or four rows up from the bottom of the body and whip stitch it into place using the yarn needle. Make sure that the tail is horizontally centered between the two ears. You also need to make sure that the animal can sit flat once the tail is stitched in place. If not, you may need to move it up a little. Put the paws in place. Use your yarn needle to whip stitch two paws onto the bottom of the animal and two paws onto its front. The two bottom paws should be positioned just below round 13 of the body. They should be a little lower than the tail and positioned toward the front of the body. The two top paws should be below the eighth round of the body and angled inward. Glue on the eyes and nose. Glue the eyes in place first, followed by the nose. Use fabric glue or hot glue for best results. The eyes should be in line with the sixth round of the body. The nose should be horizontally centered between the two eyes on the row below them. Admire your work. At this point, your tiny stuffed teddy bear, dog, or cat should be complete and ready to adore.",
