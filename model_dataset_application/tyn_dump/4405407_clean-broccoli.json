When you first put the broccoli in the water, swirl it around in the water a few times to loosen any larger pieces of dirt. If you use warm water, the florets of the broccoli can wilt slightly. If you don\u2019t have a sink available, you can use a large bowl instead. Just make sure the broccoli is submerged under the water."
