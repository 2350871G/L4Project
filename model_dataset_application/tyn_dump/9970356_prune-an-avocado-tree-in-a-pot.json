You\u2019ll want to trim the tips off these branches when they get to be 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) long. Trimming the tips off these branches discourages new outward growth and will help keep your plant a good width for its pot. Leave the shorter lateral branches alone. This is where flowers and fruit generally grow, so these shorter branches don\u2019t need to be disturbed."
