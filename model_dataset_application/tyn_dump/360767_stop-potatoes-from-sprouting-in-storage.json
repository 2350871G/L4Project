Wherever you decide to store the potatoes, make sure that the temperatures remain consistent. If they change too much, the potatoes may start to rot or sprout. If you store the potatoes below 40\u00b0F (4.5\u00b0C), use them within 6 to 8 months. If you store the potatoes above 40\u00b0F (4.5\u00b0C), use them within 3 to 4 months."
