You\u2019ll need a bag for each color of glitter that you want to make. Fill them with as much salt as you would like, though you shouldn't fill them to the brim or the glitter will be difficult to mix later. You can use any type of salt that you like, such as regular non-iodized table salt. However, coarser salts, including kosher and sea salt, usually work best. You can even use Epsom salt, which tends to sparkle on its own. Keep in mind that the amount of salt you use is the amount of glitter you\u2019ll be making."

You can add as much or as little food coloring to the salt as you\u2019d like. However, the more salt that you\u2019re using, the more food coloring you\u2019ll need to add. In most cases, the more food coloring you add, the darker and more saturated the finished color will be. You may need to add as many as 10 drops if you want very dark glitter and you\u2019re making a large batch. For soft, pastel glitter, 1 or 2 drops of food coloring may be enough. It\u2019s usually best to start out with a small amount of food coloring. You can always add more if you want to deepen the glitter\u2019s color."
