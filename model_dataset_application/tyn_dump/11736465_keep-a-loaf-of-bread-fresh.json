          "description":"Find a flat, cool, and dry space in your kitchen or eating area to place your box. Arrange 1 or multiple loaves into the breadbox without cramming them into the container. Keep the box closed, and try to eat or use the bread within a few days time. You can purchase bread boxes online or in most home goods stores. They\u2019re made from a variety of materials like ceramic, bamboo, and more. Breadboxes help provide a slightly humid environment for your bread without a lot of air circulation. This helps keep your bread fresh without it turning stale. A microwave can work as an impromptu breadbox, as long as you keep it turned off."
