The crop is attached tightly to the body of the chicken, so you'll have to work it free. Take care not to break the crop open, since it it is likely to contain food the bird was in the process of digesting. If you do break it open, just remove as much of the tissue and its contents as possible. If the crop is empty of food, it may be more difficult to locate. It will be lying flat against the breast."
