Saw palmetto is especially common in Florida. Look for berries in the fall months of September and October when the fruits are ripe. You will know they are ripe by their dark brown to black color.

Saw palmettos are a cash crop in Florida and you can be fined if you are caught picking berries that are being commercially farmed."
