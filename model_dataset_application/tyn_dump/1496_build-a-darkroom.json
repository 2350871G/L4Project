Take some black fabric, cut slightly larger than the windows, and tape it around the edges of the windows. Alternatively, you can use cardboard or thin plywood to block of windows, with fabric and tape around the edges to completely seal out light. If light leaks in around the door, affix a strip of fabric along its edge in the same manner. You\u2019ll have an easier time spotting encroaching light by turning off the room\u2019s lights. As your eyes adjust to the dark, you\u2019ll have an easier time spotting places where the light leaks in."

This will protect your photos from costly mistakes, as well as make sure you don\u2019t damage your equipment. The dry side will include your electronic equipment and should be close to the outlet. Having running water near the wet side of your darkroom will make the development process much simpler. Make sure to check the water quality in your darkroom; errant particles can negatively impact the development process. Run the water over a tray for 15 minutes. If there are visible particles at the bottom of the tray, you\u2019ll need a water filter."
