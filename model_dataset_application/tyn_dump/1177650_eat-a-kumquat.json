Once you encounter the mouth-puckering juice, you can either keep nibbling cautiously or pop the whole fruit in your mouth. If you can stand it, the explosive wedding ceremony between tart and sweet is unique in the fruit world. Some kumquat species are less sour than others or have a thicker peel. If the flavor doesn't impress you, try to find a different type, or use the fruits in cooking. If you hate the sour taste, squeeze out the juice and eat the peel by itself."
