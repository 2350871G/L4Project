If you know another gardener in the process of dividing daylilies, ask if they\u2019d be willing to share some of their root divisions with you.

To get the most blooms, choose a location that receives a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. However, daylilies can easily handle 8 to 12 hours of full sun daily. Daylilies planted in the shade will bloom less frequently."

To test your soil's drainage, dig a hole that is 1 ft (30 cm) wide and 1 ft (30 cm) deep. Fill the hole with water. If the water drains in 10 minutes or less, you have well-draining soil. If it takes an hour or more, your soil drainage is poor. To amend soil that drains poorly, add some organic matter like well-rotted manure, wood chips, pea gravel, or peat moss. Mix it into the existing soil thoroughly."

Anything under 7 is considered acidic. Anything above 7 is considered alkaline. To reduce acidity in your soil, add garden limestone. To reduce alkalinity, amend the soil with sulfur, gypsum, or sphagnum peat moss."

The crown is where the stem and roots meet. The soil level above the roots should be about even with the soil in the new location.
