Peppers come in many different varieties, and some options might not be available at all times of the year. Shop around until you find a place that sells healthy, organic green bell pepper seeds. If you have a large garden, make the most of your planting space and look into other types of peppers that can be grown alongside green peppers.

Green peppers can be grown basically year-round in arid regions where the environment is hot and temperate. Just make sure your plants get enough water if you're growing them in a place that's hot with dry conditions. Most people should plan on starting their seedlings indoors around late January or early February and transplanting them after around 10 weeks.

Try to choose a location that receives direct sunlight, and make sure you plant the peppers far enough away from other hearty fruits and vegetables to avoid competition for nutrients. Green peppers do best if they\u2019re grown in places with temperatures around 70 degrees or hotter.

Some pepper plants don\u2019t even need a separate fertilizer if a little compost is added to the soil at intervals. Organic materials like mulch also help the soil retain moisture, which is useful for making sure green pepper plants get enough water in hot weather. Since calcium deficiency can cause the bottom end to rot on peppers, you can increase the amount of calcium in your soil by grinding eggshells and mixing it in with your soil (alternatively, use lime).
