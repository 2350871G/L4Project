If you don\u2019t have any luck finding it pre-shredded, you can take the time to julienne it yourself or use a Kiwi shredder. Look over the papaya closely before you buy it. It should be a deep green color on the outside and be firm to the touch, with very little give. If you\u2019re using fresh, whole papaya, it will need to be seeded before it\u2019s shredded.

  "text":" Crushing the Aromatic Ingredients Gather your ingredients. To get started, you should lay out all the aromatic ingredients you will be using to flavor the salad.
