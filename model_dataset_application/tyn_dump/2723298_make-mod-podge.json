    "Homemade Mod Podge is usually made using watered-down glue, so it lacks some of the properties that store-bought Mod Podge has.",
    "Store-bought Mod Podge can be used as both an adhesive and sealant, making it durable.",
    "The homemade version is less-adhesive, and lacks varnish or sealer.",
    "To make your homemade Mod Podge more durable, consider spraying your project with an acrylic sealant after the Mod Podge has dried.#Know that the finish differs between the two.",
    "Store-bought Mod Podge comes in all sorts of finishes from glossy, to satin, to matte.",
    "It even comes in glow-in-the-dark and sparkling varieties.",
    "Unless you add varnish or glitter, your homemade Mod Podge will be matte.",
