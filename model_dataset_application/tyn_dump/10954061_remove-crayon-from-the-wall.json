Turn off your sink once the magic eraser is wet and squeeze it to wring out the excess water. You can buy a magic eraser in the cleaning section of any big box store.

If the eraser doesn't cause any damage, you can use it on your crayon marks. If the eraser leaves damage, try using a different cleaning method.Tip: Some areas you can test the magic eraser include behind furniture or in a corner close to the floor."
