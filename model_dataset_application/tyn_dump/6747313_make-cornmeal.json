You can also use nearly any variety of home-grown corn if you\u2019re feeling more adventurous, but the process can be more time-consuming since you\u2019ll need to dry it on the stalk.

    "Sift the ground corn through the mesh strainer one more time, collecting the fine meal in your original bowl and retaining the coarser grits in the strainer itself.",
    "The grits will be the remnants of dehydrated corn that are too coarse to pass through the fine sifter.",
    "At this point, you should have more cornmeal than leftover grits, and the amount of cornmeal should roughly match the original amount of dried corn you began with.",
    "If you\u2019re still not satisfied with the amount of cornmeal produced, you can pass the coarse grits through your grain mill one more time.",
    "Afterward, sift them again using the mesh strainer.",
    "The amount of cornmeal produced by a fourth pass will likely be less than the amount produced by the previous two passes.",
    "Beyond a fourth pass, additional passes through the grain mill may become even less beneficial.",
    "Using and Storing the Cornmeal Cook with the cornmeal immediately after making it if desired.",
    "Using the cornmeal the same day or the next day will allow you to retain the maximum amount of nutrients and flavor.",
    "Use the cornmeal or the grits that you saved to make grits, cornbread, or Johnny cakes.",
    "You can also use homemade cornmeal in any recipe calling for cornmeal, including cornmeal mush and cornmeal-based fish batter.",
    "Seal the cornmeal in plastic bags if you\u2019ll use it within several months.",
    "This should prevent it from turning rancid.",
    "Place the cornmeal in a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag.",
    "Press out as much air as possible, then seal the bag, leaving only 1 inch (2.5 cm) of open space along the seal.",
    "Suck out the remaining air through a straw inserted into the opening.",
    "Do this step carefully to avoid accidentally inhaling bits of cornmeal.",
    "When finished, quickly remove the straw and seal the remainder of the opening.",
    "Sealed bags of cornmeal can be stored in dark, dry, slightly cool conditions for up to 12 months.",
    "Freeze leftover cornmeal if you\u2019re not going to cook with it for a year.",
    "Cornmeal you don\u2019t plan to use immediately can be transferred into freezer-safe containers and stored in your freezer.",
    "Pack the cornmeal into an appropriate jar or other container, leaving about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of empty headspace.",
    "Close the jar and place it into your freezer, storing it there for as long as 24 months.",
    "You can use the cornmeal directly from the freezer without thawing it.",
    "If you\u2019re making a temperature-sensitive recipe, thaw the cornmeal at room temperature for 30-60 minutes before use."
