          "description":"Because the molding will sit against your wall at an angle, each joint (that is, each place where two strips of crown molding meet) will be a compound angle. The molding will need to be mitered to achieve the angle, and beveled to fit snugly against each adjacent piece. Achieving this using 2 separate cuts is very difficult, so this guide will teach you how to cut both of these angles using a single cut. For this, you need a guide fence, which is a piece of plywood glued to your saw table that helps you position the molding in exactly the same place for each piece. Place a piece of molding upside-down on the miter saw table. The side of the molding that will contact the ceiling should be against the saw table, and the side that will contact the wall should be against the saw's vertical fence. Make sure that the decorative side is facing you, and hold the molding at the same angle at which you will install it. Secure the molding with clamps to the vertical fence. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/67\\/Install-Crown-Molding-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Install-Crown-Molding-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/67\\/Install-Crown-Molding-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Install-Crown-Molding-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nGet a piece of plywood or dimension lumber that is just as long as your saw table.

Apply a small amount of glue to each scarf joint before nailing the next piece, and wipe excess glue away with a cloth as you work. Continue until all molding is in place. If a corner joint doesn't quite fit, use a rasp to quickly and evenly grind down extra wood, testing regularly against the joint until you find a perfect fit.

Whichever style you choose, use an angle sash brush (which is preferred for its ability to paint sharp, clean lines easily), and apply your paint evenly and methodically.

Fit the scarf joint together snugly, and fasten the second piece with finish nails. Wipe away any excess glue. Nail the rest of the molding in place. Working either clockwise or counterclockwise, affix each piece of molding using the process outlined above. This will be much easier with two people, since one person can hold each piece of molding in place while the other hammers it down, but it can be done alone if necessary. Apply a small amount of glue to each scarf joint before nailing the next piece, and wipe excess glue away with a cloth as you work. Continue until all molding is in place. If a corner joint doesn't quite fit, use a rasp to quickly and evenly grind down extra wood, testing regularly against the joint until you find a perfect fit. Boring small holes into the points of each outside corner joint allows you to secure the corners to the wall firmly with an extra finish nail in each hole. Smooth the crown. 100-grit sandpaper is suitable for finishing scarf joints on bald wood. For pre-finished white crown molding, use paint-on white caulk to smooth the joints. Caulk is also appropriate for smoothing over nail holes and any other marks in the molding. Consider caulking in the gap between the top of the crown and the ceiling for a smoother appearance, if there is such a gap. Paint the crown. This step will require paint and a brush. Enamel paints are generally the best for this kind of work, and fall into two basic categories: acrylic enamel, which dries quickly and is less odorous than its counterpart, but which has a flatter finish, or alkyd enamel, which takes longer to dry and has a stronger smell, but whose deep, lustrous finish cannot be matched by acrylic paint. Whichever style you choose, use an angle sash brush (which is preferred for its ability to paint sharp, clean lines easily), and apply your paint evenly and methodically. The standard color for crown molding is white, but other colors may be appropriate depending on the effect you desire for the room you are working on. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3b\\/Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3b\\/Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nYou can also paint the molding before you install it, but be aware that you'll have to repaint anywhere that gets scuffed during installation. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/56\\/Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/56\\/Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Install-Crown-Molding-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}",
