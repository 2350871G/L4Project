The reasoning behind this is that cappuccinos have lots of dairy in them, which doesn\u2019t settle well in the stomach in the afternoon or evening. Drink your cappuccino in the morning to avoid indigestion. While Italians never drink cappuccinos in the afternoon or evening, it\u2019s safe to drink regular coffee any time during the day. You might instead opt for a macchiato in the afternoon, or an espresso after dinner."
