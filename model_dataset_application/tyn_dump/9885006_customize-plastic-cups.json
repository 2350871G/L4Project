You can use the contact paper to create an adhesive stencil, but keep your design simple. Designs with lots of small details often do not transfer well. You can use lettering in your design. Instead of drawing a design, you can trace a pre-printed image onto the contact paper. Visit an art supply store to find contact paper as well as adhesive stencils you can use if you would don\u2019t want to create your own design."

This is because the plastic will be exposed in these areas, so the paint will reach it. Leave the contact paper intact over any spots you do not want painted. To prepare your design, cut along the outermost outline to separate it from the paper. Then, sparingly cut out any larger details that can give your design definition. Avoid cutting the entire design out of the paper. Leave it attached at 1 end, since this makes painting a lot easier later. For example, if you want a cat on your cup, you should cut around the outside border. Then, cut around the outline for the nose, mouth, and whiskers so these are painted later."
