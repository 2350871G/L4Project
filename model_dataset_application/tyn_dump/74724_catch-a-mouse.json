Similar objects can be used as long as they\u2019re big enough for the mouse to fit inside but also flimsy enough to not support the mouse\u2019s weight. Stores may also carry humane traps.

A small dollop of peanut butter, some cracker crumbs, or a sliver of bacon will be enough to attract the mouse. Peanut butter works well because it sticks to the inside of the tube.
