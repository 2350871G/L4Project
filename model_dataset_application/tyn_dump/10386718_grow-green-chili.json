If you already have chilis at home, wait until they\u2019re overripe and cut them in half to remove the seeds. Once these seeds are dried out, you can plant them in the soil. An overripe chili will be red and beginning to shrivel a bit. Seeds from a chili that isn't ripe yet may not germinate because the seeds aren't mature. Dry the seeds by laying them out on a paper towel for several hours."

It\u2019s best if the seeds start off indoors so that the plant gets a head start before you plant it outdoors. Chiles don't do well in frost, which is why it's important to wait until the threat of frost has completely passed for the season before you plant them outside. It takes the seeds 2-4 months to grow and produce fruit, which is why it's important to start early."

Fill the cells roughly three-fourths of the way full with the soil, and make sure the cells have holes at the bottom for drainage. Seedling trays are perfect for sowing seeds as you can fill each 1 in (2.5 cm) cell with individual seeds and monitor their growth easily. Look for a seed starter soil blend, if desired."

Lay them on the soil gently, spacing each of the seeds a little bit apart in each cell so that they have room to grow. You don\u2019t need to press the seeds down in the soil.

Be careful not to overwater the soil, as chili plants don\u2019t like excessive amounts of water.
