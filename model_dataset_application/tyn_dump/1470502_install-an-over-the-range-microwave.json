Your microwave may have additional fittings which you should set in place in order to allow it to ventilate properly.

Your microwave should come with a kit that has a framing template. Place it where you want the microwave to sit, and follow the guidelines to cut through the drywall. Remove the drywall and pull out the insulation from the area inside the wall. Secure two by fours between the wall studs. Check the instructions provided with your microwave for the exact dimensions.
