To remove the top and bottom, position your knife just past the pits on either end and slice into the melon with a sharp, serrated knife, using consistent pressure. Serrated knives work well when cutting melon because the edge of the knife can easily saw into a tough rind. If you don\u2019t have a serrated knife, use a large chopping knife instead."

          "description":"After you remove the top and bottom of the melon, sit your melon on 1 end, and position your serrated knife across the other end. Press down with moderate, consistent force to cut your melon in half. As you do this, hold the outside of the melon carefully with your hand so it doesn\u2019t move or slip. Be very careful as you make your cut so you don\u2019t hurt yourself or drop the melon. If you\u2019re cutting a large melon, like a watermelon, it may be easier to make a horizontal cut. Just position the knife in the middle of the melon, and gradually make horizontal cuts as you turn the melon until you reach the other side. This makes it much easier to slice the melon in half, rather than trying to cut directly through the entire thing."

In this case, position the tip of the spoon at the beginning of the fleshy section and scoop the insides out. Continue scooping until you get to the end, and throw away the seeds and pulp. As you do this, hold the melon over of a trash can so you can easily get rid of the seeds and pulp. If your melon doesn\u2019t have its seeds in the center, such as a watermelon, then this is not required. You can remove the seeds as you eat the sliced melon instead."
