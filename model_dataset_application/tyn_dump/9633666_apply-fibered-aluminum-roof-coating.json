          "description":"If you're working on a multi-story commercial building, the safest way to get onto the roof is to use the roof access stairwell or ladder located on the side or rear of the building. For workshops, warehouses, and similar structures, it will be necessary to set up a portable ladder tall enough to clear the roof by a few feet. Once you're on top, tread carefully and stay a safe distance away from the edge of the building at all times. Have an assistant steady the ladder for you as you climb, and consider using a safety harness to avoid potential mishaps. Make sure you steer clear of air vents, skylights, and rotten or damaged patches."

Any lingering materials left behind may be visible in the new finish once it dries. If possible, sweep smaller debris off the rear or side of the roof where it will be less noticeable, rather than over an entrance or parking lot. Another option is to use a portable shop vacuum to suction up the dirt you come across."

          "description":"If the surface of the roof is particularly dirty, you may need to try a more intensive cleaning method. Sweep the nozzle of a pressure washer over areas with stuck-on mud, mold, oil stains, or similar residue. When you\u2019re done, switch to a lower setting (around 20 psi) and rinse off the loose mess. A modest pressure setting of around 30-50 psi should be enough to get most smooth roofing materials spotless. Specialty roof cleaning solutions may help cut through stubborn grit and grime."

However, you should be prepared to wait up to 24 hours, depending on weather conditions. If you\u2019re getting started late in the day, take care of all the necessary cleaning and come back the following morning to finish applying the aluminum coating."

    "To touch up less accessible surfaces, it may help to swap your roller out for a handheld brush.",
    "Dip the brush into the aluminum coating and use the tip to fill in corners, crevices, and recesses.",
    "A paintbrush can also be useful for working around antennas, skylights, brackets, air conditioning units, and other tricky rooftop fixtures.",
    "Brush with long, linear strokes to prevent leaving drips in the dried finish.",
    "Allow the new coating to cure completely.",
    "It may take up to 24 hours to harden to the point where it can successfully protect against moisture, pressure, and heat.",
    "Once the coating has had ample time to dry, it will seal, protect, and extend the lifespan of your roof."
