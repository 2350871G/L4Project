Canning the Salsa Pour the salsa into clean canning jars. Fill the jars to within a quarter inch (half a cm) of the rim. Use a funnel to ensure that the seal between the jar and the lid stays clean. You may want to wash the canning jars using the hot water cycle on your dishwasher before starting the process. Place the lids into boiling water for a couple of minutes to sanitize them.
