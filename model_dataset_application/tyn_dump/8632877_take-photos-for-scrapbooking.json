          "description":"When you are setting up photos for your scrapbook, try to shoot outdoors and use natural lighting. Aim to shoot in the morning or late afternoon, when outdoor light tends to be best. Using natural light will give your photos a more golden hue and often produce nice background settings for your photos. Cloudy or overcast days are often best for shooting people. Try not to shoot people outdoors when the sun is high in the sky without clouds, as this can create harsh lighting that is not flattering for your subjects."

This may be useful if you want to capture loved ones all together as a group or for a special occasion, such as someone's birthday or anniversary. Arrange gatherings in a location with nice background settings. Hold events at your home and use them as a photo opportunity for your scrapbook. For example, you may host your daughter's birthday party and use it as an opportunity to take photos for a scrapbook page on her birthday."

For example, if you are making a page in your scrapbook on your siblings, you may make sure you get individual images of each sibling at a family gathering."

Check that there are no obstructions over the person's face or any things from the landscape that may appear to be coming out of the person's head, such as trees or poles. The viewfinder can help you make sure every image you capture looks good. You should also use the viewfinder to make sure you are capturing a setting or a person in good light.

If you are photographing a group of people, focus on the top half of their bodies and do not worry about getting their legs or feet in the photo. Zoom in on faces and scenes so the frame is full and does not have a lot of empty space. When you are zooming into faces, make sure the person's eyes are in focus.

Use the viewfinder on the camera to confirm the background is nice before you snap the photo. Ask a subject to move or gather in a spot with a nice background so the photo looks good. For example, if you are photographing a big group of people in a park, you may ask everyone to stand in front of trees in the park or a fountain, rather than by the trashcans in the park."

If you are shooting a big group, stand on a chair above the group so you can get everyone in the photo. If you are shooting one person, stand in front of them and make sure you are at their level when you take their picture. When you are taking photos of children for your scrapbook, shoot them at a low angle. This may mean squatting or sitting down so you are at the same level as the child or just a below them. If you want to get a shot of a person standing in front of a nice background, step back from them so you can get the person and some of the background in the photo."

It can be good to have backup copies, especially if you are going to be cutting or decorating the photos in your scrapbook. You may also try laying out the photos on a page in your scrapbook to make sure they are what you want.

You can also use inserts or photo corners instead to attach the photos to the pages, as this will require no adhesive and ensure the photos lay flat on the page."

For example, if you are making a scrapbook about your daughter, you may start with photos from when she was born. Then, you may continue with photos of her birthdays and other landmark moments like her first step or her first bath. You may then end the scrapbook with current photos of her now."
