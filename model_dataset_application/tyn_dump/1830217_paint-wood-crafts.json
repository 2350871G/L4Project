Also, make sure that you are sanding with the grain of the wood, not across it. Some wooden pieces from craft stores come pre-sanded. If the surface area is completely smooth, skip this step."

If you can't find a tack cloth anywhere, try a damp cloth instead. It would be a good idea to do this, even if you didn't sand your piece; items bought from stores are sometimes dusty, which can prevent the primer and paint from sticking."

You can use the cheap, craft-grade acrylic paint that comes in bottles, or you can use the more-expensive artist's grade that comes in tubes. If you are using the artist's grade, dilute it with a few drops of water until it has the consistency of cream first. You can use small dishes, plastic lids, and paper plates as palettes."

Do the front and sides first, let them dry to the touch, then do the back. Look for brushes made from taklon, katakana, or sable. Avoid camel hair brushes or stiff, bristle brushes.

For example, if you wanted to paint a smiley face, you'd paint the yellow circle first, let it dry, then add the smile and eyes. Dip the brush in water often to keep the paint wet, even if you are using one color. If you are working with multiple colors, keep a cup of water nearby.

Go over the outline using a thin, painted brush, then fill the design in using a flat brush. This method works best over painted wood. You can do it over bare wood, but the paint may not stick as well. If you don't know how to draw, print the design out on tracing paper first, then place the tracing paper on top of the graphite paper. If you are working over a dark-colored surface, make some chalk graphite paper instead: cover the back of a piece of paper with chalk, place it chalk-side-down onto the wood, then trace your design."

This will help blend strokes together without covering up the wood grain. The cloth should be wet, but not dripping. Alternatively, you can paint over the entire piece using watered down acrylics or watercolor paints."

Allow the chalkboard paint dry and cure completely. Cover the board with chalk, then wipe the chalk off.

  "text":" Prepping the Wood Sand the surface of the object with 140 to 180-grit sandpaper. You can do this with a sanding sponge or with a piece of sandpaper; a sanding sponge will work the best on curved surfaces, however. Also, make sure that you are sanding with the grain of the wood, not across it. Some wooden pieces from craft stores come pre-sanded. If the surface area is completely smooth, skip this step.

It would be a good idea to do this, even if you didn't sand your piece; items bought from stores are sometimes dusty, which can prevent the primer and paint from sticking. Apply a coat of primer. You can use the brush-on kind or the spray-on kind. This will seal the wood surface, and help it take the paint better. It will also help the paint show up better, especially if you are using a light color. Prime the front and sides first, let them dry, then prime the back. Allow the primer to dry before moving on. For an even smoother finish, you can sand the first coat of primer, wipe it clean, then apply more primer over it. Do this a few more times until there no ridges remain. Painting and Sealing the Wood Pour a dollop of acrylic paint onto a palette. Choose a color for the background, then pour out a small amount onto a palette.
