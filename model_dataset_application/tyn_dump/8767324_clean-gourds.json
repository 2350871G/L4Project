If you do not have buckets, other options include covering them with wet towels or letting them sit out under a sprinkler. Allow them to sit for 30 minutes and the hard gourd skin will soften. Avoid using hot water, as this can cause the gourd to crack."

Press hard while scrubbing to remove the skin, but try to hold back a little to avoid scratching the gourd itself. This can be done while the gourd is wet or in water. Water exposure makes the skin come off easier and, as long as the gourd doesn\u2019t have holes in it, won\u2019t damage the gourd. Avoid using steel wool.

Scrub the gourd again. When the mold still won\u2019t go away, try dipping the gourd in a 10% solution of bleach (ten parts water to one part bleach) or about two cups (473 mL) of chlorine bleach to five gallons (18.9 L) water and scrubbing the gourd."

When the opening is too small or the seeds are in a tough ball, you can soak the gourd in warm water for 30 minutes. However, it will take several hours for the gourd to dry.
