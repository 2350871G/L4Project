Envision the way you want your finished quilt to look as you make your fabric choice. Fabric with a crosswise grain, as opposed to a lengthwise grain, is a sturdier choice for binding. Because of the direction of the grain, a split in one area won\u2019t run along the entire length of the binding. Instead, it will run crosswise and end at the seam where the binding joins the quilt. Bias binding strips, with a grain that runs diagonally, are also good for sturdy binding. Again, a split in the fabric won\u2019t travel as far since the grain doesn\u2019t run the length of the fabric."

The most common seam allowance is \u00bc\u201d. Use the walking foot on your sewing machine to prevent the fabric from bunching up. Sew along the first side of the quilt until you\u2019ve reached the same distance from the corner as your seam allowance.
