    "You need the solution to be thick enough to drizzle from your whisk, so adjust the amount of water as needed.",
    "You may end up using a little less than \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of water.",
    "Stir in a few drops of liquid food coloring.",
    "Start with just 2 to 3 drops.",
    "Keep stirring until the color is even and all streaks are gone.",
    "The more food coloring you add, the darker the color will be.",
    "Keep in mind that chalk paint will lighten up a bit once it dries.",
    "Skip this step if you want the chalk paint to be white.",
    "Use the paint on a sidewalk or driveway.",
    "You can apply the paint straight from the jar with a paintbrush.",
    "You can also pour it into a plastic squeeze bottle, then drizzle it over your painting surface.",
    "Sidewalks and driveways are the most popular surfaces for this type of paint, but you can use paper as well.",
    "Making Flour and Salt Paint Mix together equal amounts of flour, salt, and cold water.",
    "Pour \u00bd cup (50 grams) of flour and \u00bd cup (136 grams) of salt into a bowl.",
    "Mix them together, then stir in \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of cold water.",
    "You can prepare this paint in a cup, bowl, or jar\u2014whichever is easiest for you.",
    "This will be the final texture of your paint.",
    "If it is too thick, add another \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of water.",
    "Divide mixture between several containers.",
    "You will need one container for each color that you want to make.",
    "You can also leave everything in one bowl if you wish to make just one color.",
    "Keep in mind that the more you divide the mixture up, the less paint you'll have of each color.",
    "You can make however many colors you want.",
    "2 to 3 colors would be just right, however, based on the amount of flour, salt, and water.",
    "Stir in 2 to 3 drops of food coloring into each cup.",
    "Use a different color for each one.",
    "If the color is not bright enough for you, you can add more food coloring.",
    "You can also skip this step if you want white paint.",
    "Use the paint within a couple of days.",
    "You can apply it straight from the container you mixed it in.",
    "It may be too thick for paintbrushes, but it will be just right for fingers.",
    "You can also pour thicker paint into a plastic squeeze bottle and use it as a puffy paint instead.",
    "Store the paint in a sealed container in the fridge.",
    "Throw it out once it starts to look moldy.",
    "Making Chalk Paint Place 1 to 2 pieces of colored chalk inside a resealable plastic bag.",
    "For best results, use sidewalk chalk instead of chalkboard chalk.",
    "It is much more pigmented.",
    "The more chalk you use, the more paint you will have.",
    "Use two different colors to create a new color!",
    "Smash the chalk into a powder with a hammer.",
    "Place the bag with the chalk inside of it on top of a hard surface, such as a wooden board or a sidewalk.",
    "Hit the chalk with a hammer several times until it turns fine and powdery.",
    "Take this time to create more colors.",
    "Use one color of chalk per bag.",
    "If you are using a thin bag, such as a sandwich bag, place a paper towel under it, and another one on top of it.",
    "This will keep the bag from ripping.",
    "Pour the powder into a jar.",
    "Make sure that the jar is big enough to hold at least 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.",
    "If you smashed multiple bags of chalk to create more colors, use a separate jar for each color.",
    "Stir in \u00bd to 1 cup (120 to 240 milliliters) water into the powdered chalk.",
    "Use If you one piece of chalk, use \u00bd (120 milliliters) of water.",
    "If you used two pieces of chalk, use 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.",
    "Stir the paint well until the chalk dissolves.",
    "If you need to close the jar tightly and shake it to help mix the water and chalk.",
    "If you smashed additional bags of chalk, you will need another \u00bd to 1 cup (120 to 240 milliliters) of water for each batch.",
    "You can thicken the paint by adding 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of white glue to it.",
    "Keep in mind that this will make the paint permanent.",
    "Use the paint on a sidewalk or driveway.",
    "Apply the paint using a paintbrush.",
    "When you are done using the paint, close the jar tightly.",
    "If the paint starts to turn too thick, add some water to it to thin it out again.",
    "You should be able to dilute it 5 to 10 times before it becomes too thin to use.",
    "The chalk may settle in the water.",
    "If that happens, stir it back up again.",
    "If you added glue to the chalk, use it on paper\u2014unless you want it to be permanent!"
