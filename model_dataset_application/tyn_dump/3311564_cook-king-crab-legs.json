If you\u2019re trying to thaw them in a hurry, submerge them in cold, running water. Although you can cook frozen king crab legs in most cases, they cook at a quicker and more even rate when thawed first. King crab legs spoil rapidly. For that reason, don\u2019t thaw them out days in advance. Most crab legs are sold frozen to preserve their freshness. You won\u2019t find a lot of fresh crab unless you live near the ocean.

However, king crab legs are pretty big and may not fit as well as you would like. To compensate, use something sharp, like kitchen shears, a good chef\u2019s knife, or a paring knife. Cut across the legs as the joints to separate them into multiple pieces. If you have the opportunity to cook the legs whole, leave them alone.

Run a sharp, serrated paring knife vertically down the center. Be careful to avoid cutting into the meat. Leave the shell closed and intact until you have finished cooking the legs. Then, you can pull them open at the cut you made. They will be easier to open this way. Don\u2019t pull open the shell or cut it too deeply. Exposing the meat makes it more likely to dry out while it\u2019s cooking. Score the shell, but don\u2019t cut through it."

A steamer insert is basically a small metal basket that helps cook food by holding it above the water level. Make sure the water doesn\u2019t reach the steamer basket or the crab legs.

Since you aren\u2019t using a lot of water, you won\u2019t have to worry too much about it bubbling over. However, make sure you have enough water to last for at least 5 minutes.

Then, cut a lemon into quarters and squeeze them onto the crab legs. For additional flavor, chop up 5 cloves of garlic and sprinkle them over the crab legs. Add \u00bd of a cup (2.5 g) of parsley, 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) of sea salt, and 1 teaspoon (2.33 g) of black pepper as well. You can also melt some butter to pour over the crab legs once you\u2019re done grilling them. Cook the crab legs on the grill for about 5 minutes. Place the crab legs closer to the side of the grill, away from the coals or direct heat, to prevent them from overcooking. Keep them about 5 in (13 cm) away from the heat. Then, close the grill top and leave the crab legs undisturbed. If you\u2019re cooking the crab legs in foil, be sure to wrap them up tightly to lock in any added seasonings. Butter and other ingredients won\u2019t do you any good if they leak out! Flip the crab legs and cook them for up to 5 minutes. Use a pair of tongs to turn them over, keeping them in the same spot on the grill. Close the top again when you\u2019re done. When the crab legs are done, they will be bright red and have a strong smell. They will also be consistently warm all over. Note that the cooking time can vary a lot depending on your grill and the heat setting used. All grills cook food at a different rate. Keep an eye on the crab legs to prevent them from burning. Boiling Crab Legs in Water Fill a large stockpot half-full with cold water. The amount of water you need will depend on the stockpot you\u2019re using. A basic stockpot takes about 24 cups (5,700 mL) of water, but adjust the amount as needed. This will be enough to cook about 4 lb (1.8 kg) of king crab legs. Make sure the crab legs are completely submerged in the water or else they may not cook evenly. If your stock pot is too small, cook the crab legs in batches or use multiple pots. Salt and season the water if you wish to flavor the crab legs. For example, start with 1 tablespoon (17.06 g) of salt and stir it into the pot of water. Then, mix in 2 tablespoons (34.12 g) of store-bought seafood seasoning. You could mix in herbs like parsley and dill, put garlic and lemons in the pot, or customize the flavor however you wish. The salt is useful for seasoning the crab legs and getting them to cook at a more uniform rate. Even if you don\u2019t plan on adding anything else, the salt is worth adding. Turn the heat up high until the water begins to boil. Set your stove to a high setting and wait. Watch for the water to bubble at a consistent rate. It will take a little bit of time, so don\u2019t rush to turn down the heat. The water has to be boiling before you put the crab legs into the pot. If it isn\u2019t boiling, you will have a much harder time determining when the crab legs are done cooking. Submerge the crab legs in the water. Drop the crab legs into the water, taking care to avoid splashes from the hot water. Use tongs to push the crab legs down and tuck them into the water as much as possible. Try to keep them completely covered by the water before letting them cook. Any parts that are out of the water won\u2019t get cooked. If you want the legs to cook at the same rate, keep them submerged. If you can\u2019t fit all of the legs into the pot, save some of them to cook later. Reduce the heat to medium and wait for the water to boil again. Adding the crab legs reduces the water temperature, so it won\u2019t be bubbling anymore. Wait a couple of minutes until it begins to bubble rapidly again. Once it reaches that point, it will quickly cook the crab legs at an even rate. Plan on simmering the crab legs until they\u2019re done. Check the water for tiny, consistent bubbles and wisps of steam. Start the timer once the water reaches that point. Boil the crab legs for 5 to 7 minutes until they are heated through. Leave the pot uncovered and watch as the crab legs change color. They will turn a consistent shade of red as they fill your kitchen with a delicious smell. Once they look done, use tongs to pull them out of the water. Put them on a plate to eat warm. Try serving the warm crab legs with melted butter and lemon juice. You could also enjoy them plain if you wish.",
