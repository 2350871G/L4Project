For example, if the stone you want to wire wrap is 2 in (5.1 cm) wide, then you will need at least 24 in (61 cm) of wire. You may also use 20 or 21 gauge copper or colored wire if you prefer. 20 or 21 gauge is ideal for wrapping a pendant since it is easy to work with, but strong enough to secure the stone.

Then, use a pair of wire cutters to sever the wire at this point. File the ends of the wire with a metal file to remove any sharp or jagged points.
