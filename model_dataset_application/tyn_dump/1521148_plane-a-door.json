Use a pencil to shade the area that you want to plane down.

To take out the pin, use a pair of pliers and pull the pin straight up on the bottom hinge and then the upper hinge. If you choose to unscrew the hinges, take the hinges off of the door face, keeping the hinges attached to the door frame.Tip: If you only need to remove a tiny amount of wood on the top or lock side of the door, you can plane it while it is secured to the frame. However, in most cases it will be easier to plane and repaint the door after it has been taken down. Whichever way you do it, get a helper to hold the door while you undo it. They can help hold the door steady to avoid binding the pin, damaging the hinges, or stripping the screw holes in the door. Tape the screws to the hinges to avoid misplacing them.

Once it is stable, secure it with clamps or straps so that it doesn't move when you plane. When positioning your door, take the area you are going to plane into consideration. Put the area that will be planed in a spot that will be easy for you to access.Tip: If you are having a hard time securing the door well enough to the work surface so that it can't move, ask someone to help you hold it while you plane."

There are several types of planes that will work well for planing a door. The most common is called a bench plane. It is held with both hands and is great for smoothing out areas on the edges of doors. There is also a small form of plane that is called a block plane, which is held with one hand and works well for removing small areas on a door. There are also a wide variety of specialty planes that will work for planing a door. In general, if you have a plane already, it will likely work well enough to plane small areas on a door."
