          "description":"Lightly draw a circle that takes up about 1/2 of the eyeball to create the iris. The circle should be slightly hidden by the eyelid, which will give the eye a sense of depth. Then, draw a much smaller circle near the center of the eye to make the pupil. If you have a hard time drawing circles, you can use a compass or trace something round to make the circle. The size of the pupil will depend on the lighting, so if you're drawing someone who's outside where there's lots of light, the pupil will be small. If you're drawing a woman's eye in low lighting, make the pupil larger. Press lightly so you can easily erase the pencil if you need to make corrections."

The hairs at the fullest part of the eyebrow should be pointing up while the hairs at the middle of the brow should be drawn horizontally. Then, draw the hairs near the outer edge pointing down."
