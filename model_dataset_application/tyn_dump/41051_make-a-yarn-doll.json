Begin and finish wrapping along the bottom edge of the cardboard, and be careful not to pull the yarn. Once you have finished wrapping the yarn, cut it. Your yarn can be whatever color you  want your doll to be. Wrap the yarn tight enough so that it does not slide off, but not so tight that it stretches. A single wrap finishes and starts at the bottom edge of the cardboard."

Wrap both ends around the bundle about 2 to 3 times, then tie them together into a right, double-knot. How far down you make the neck depends on the height and thickness of your doll; you need to tie it far enough down to make a round head. If you are making a 7 in (18 cm) doll, tie the neck about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the doll. Snip off the excess yarn from the neck, or tie it into a bow."
