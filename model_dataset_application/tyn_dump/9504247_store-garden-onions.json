  "text":" Harvesting and Curing Your Onions Harvest your onions when the leaves droop and turn brown. Waiting until the leaves are like this will ensure your onions are the right size for storage. To harvest your onions, dig the bulbs out of the ground using a shovel or large fork. Let your onions dry outside for 1 week. You can lay the onions on the soil you dug them out from, or put them on a wire rack. Spread the onions out so they\u2019re not touching each other. If there\u2019s rainy weather, dry the onions out in a covered space like a shed, greenhouse, or garage. Cure your onions in a covered space for 2 weeks. Curing is the process of fully drying out the outer skins of the onions. Place your onions on a wire rack or layer of newspaper so none of the onions are touching. Choose a covered space that gets air circulation so the onions don\u2019t get moist and develop mold. Cutting Your Onions Cut the roots off your onions. Lay your onions on a flat surface and use a knife or sharp scissors to snip off the roots at the bottom of each onion. Dispose of the roots after you cut them off. Cut the stems off 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) from the bulbs of your onions. The stems are the thin long parts at the tops of the onions. Use a knife or sharp scissors to cut off the stems. Peel away any loose skin on your onions. After drying and curing your onions, the outer layers of skin should be dry and starting to peel off. Use your hands to pull away the outer layers of skin. Storing Your Onions Store your onions in a net bag if you want to keep them out of sight. Use a net bag designed specifically to hold fruits and vegetables. Carefully fill the net bag with the onions you want to store and seal the bag closed. If you\u2019re storing a lot of onions, you may need to use more than 1 bag.
