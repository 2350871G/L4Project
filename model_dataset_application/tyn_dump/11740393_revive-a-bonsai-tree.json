When the leaves slowly turn yellow and die, this is usually a sign that you\u2019re overwatering your plant and the roots are starting to rot. How often you\u2019ll need to water your bonsai varies greatly from one plant to another, regardless of the species.

Bonsai trees are very sensitive to their environment, so any changes can affect how much water your plant needs at a given time. If the branches and trunk start to shrink, this may also indicate that your Bonsai is drying out and needs more water."

          "description":"If your bonsai leaves are discolored or your plant has a bit of a rotten smell, carefully lift the tree out of its pot to examine the roots for root rot. If any the roots appear shriveled and dead or smell rotten, use pruning shears or a sharp knife to cut the dead roots from the plant before repotting your bonsai. If your bonsai is struggling but you don\u2019t smell anything by sniffing the top of the soil, try sniffing through the drainage hole to see if there\u2019s a rotten smell. In addition, try scratching the roots with a sharp knife to see if they\u2019re still green inside. If they\u2019ve turned brown, they\u2019re likely rotten and need to be removed."

This helps the soil drain out excess water and nutrients, as well as filter out any bacteria that could otherwise cause an infection. While you should avoid repotting your bonsai tree more than once per year if possible, it\u2019s best to go ahead and repot it if the leaves continue to wilt or turn yellow, brown, or black, or if the roots are shriveling and dying due to a fungal or bacterial infection. Repot your tree in bonsai potting soil or a mixture of potting compost, sand, and pebbles to help with aeration and drainage."

If you see signs of mold, dip a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and dab it on the infected area. Make sure that you don\u2019t rub or wipe, which could spread the fungal infection. Use a new cotton ball for each leaf, stem, or branch to avoid spreading the mold. If you spot mold on your tree during the winter months when the tree is dormant, you can also prune your tree to remove the infected areas."

You can generally use an indoor all-purpose insecticide spray or use an insecticide specifically made to kill the type of pest your tree is infected with. How you\u2019ll apply the insecticide varies depending on the type of insecticide and the type of pest. Read the instructions for the specific insecticide you\u2019re using. The most common pest infestations on bonsai trees are aphids, red spider mites, scale insects, caterpillars, vine weevils, and mealy bugs. Scale insects and spider mites can also be killed by dabbing the infested areas with rubbing alcohol."

Leave the stick in the soil for about 5 minutes, then pull it back out. If the stick is dry, water your bonsai.

Therefore, make sure that you position your plant according to what your specific species requires. For example, Juniper bonsai trees, the most popular bonsai species, should get about 5 hours of direct sunlight in the morning, then moved into the shade in the afternoon. Ficus bonsai trees, another popular species, can thrive in both direct and indirect sunlight."

Although you can repot your bonsai any time of year if it\u2019s struggling, it\u2019s generally best to transfer it to a new pot at the end of its winter dormant period and just before its spring growing season. Because bonsais are meant to remain small, you usually won\u2019t need to use a bigger pot. You can repot your bonsai in the same pot after cleaning it and adding new bonsai soil, or transfer it to a new pot with better drainage if your plant is struggling.

Choosing a bonsai potting soil is generally your best bet. If you want to try to mix your bonsai soil, try mixing 2 parts akadama for every 1 part pumice and 1 part lava rock. The akadama helps retain moisture while the pumice and lava rock provides good drainage and aeration."
