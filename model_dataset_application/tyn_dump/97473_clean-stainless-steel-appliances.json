          "description":"Like wood, stainless steel has a grain, or a surface texture that runs in a particular direction. For appliances with a horizontal grain, wipe in straight motions from one side of the steel face to the other. For appliances with a vertical grain, wipe the steel face in long, fluid motions from top to bottom. Avoid rubbing your cloth back and forth or up and down. Try to start all your wipes from one side and move straight across or down to the other. So, for example, if you start a wipe on the left side of an appliance, wipe all the way to the right, then bring your cloth back to the left to start your next wipe. This helps decrease streaks as you wipe."
