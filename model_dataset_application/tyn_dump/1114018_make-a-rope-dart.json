Generally speaking, to get the most versatility out of your rope dart you should first measure out a distance that spans fingertip to fingertip with your arms outstretched. Hold your rope at this length, and then add to it the distance between your shoulder and the floor. Leave yourself some extra slack, so that you can fashion a loop at the end for easier handling. Extra rope is also important in case you find a long rope style suits you best. Making your rope dart too long can result in damage caused by the head of your dart dragging on the ground. This will decrease the life of your rope dart."

A bowline knot will be ideal for making a sturdy loop in the end of your line. To make a bowline knot:\nForm a loop where you want the base of your loop to be.

By adding a flag or feather to your rope dart, you'll also make your practice more visually pleasing to those observing you. The bright colors will create shapes as you swing the rope dart.
