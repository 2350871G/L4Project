Boiling water in a kettle that\u2019s less than half full can be bad for it. If it overheats, it could burn, warp, or even melt."

If your stove has burners of different sizes, select one of the larger ones. That way, the heat will be spread out evenly over a greater area. If you\u2019re timing your water with other food or beverage items, it\u2019s okay to use a slightly lower heat setting (around medium).
