You can choose any rock that appeals to you, but rocks that are smooth are ideal for painting. Weathered rocks that that have been in the water for a long time are great for painting because they have tumbled, which has left them smooth and rounded. You can\u2019t take rocks from state and national parks. Be careful when you are searching for rocks.

Make sure to protect your work surface. You can lay newspaper or paper towels out so that paint doesn\u2019t get on the table. Consider recycled empty cereal boxes for a green alternative. Cut the box open on the side and unfold it. The inside has a nice solid light gray color. which gives contrast for your painting design, and the material is stronger than paper towels.
