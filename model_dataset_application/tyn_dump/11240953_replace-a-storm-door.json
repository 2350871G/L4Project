For example, if the screws have a diameter of \u20444 inch (0.64 cm), then drill a hole that\u2019s \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) wide.

    "The top piece guides water away from the door so it doesn\u2019t drip inside or cause any internal damage.",
    "If there\u2019s more than a 1 in (2.5 cm) gap between the top of your door frame and the top of your storm door, then you need to screw a header board into the top of the frame to close the gap.",
    "Put the side plate on the frame so the door fits tightly when it\u2019s closed.",
    "Find the long metal piece in your storm door\u2019s box and hold it against the other side of the frame.",
    "Line up the top edge of the side plate with the corner of the door frame and use the provided screws to attach it in place.",
    "Test closing the door to see if there is a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) gap between it and the side piece.",
    "If not, then readjust the frame piece or add shims to close the gap.",
    "You may also need to trim the side plate so it fits in your door frame.",
    "Make sure the weatherstripping on the side piece faces the inside of your door or else it will still let it in a draft.",
    "Attaching the Hardware Attach the drilling template to the door where you want to place the handles.",
    "Look for the adhesive drilling template used for the handles on your door.",
    "Wrap the template around the side of the door at the height you want for your handles and press it firmly against it the door so it sticks.",
    "Check that the template isn\u2019t crooked with a straightedge and readjust the template if you need to so it\u2019s straight.",
    "If the drilling template doesn\u2019t have an adhesive back, then use pieces of tape to hold it in place.",
    "Drill through the marked holes on the template.",
    "Find the drill bits that match the size of the holes on the template and attach one of them to your drill.",
    "Push your drill through the guide and into the door so your hole stays straight.",
    "Continue drilling all of the holes to their proper size so you can fit the handle and latch pieces inside.",
    "If your drill slips while you\u2019re working, use a metal punch to make a starting hole in the center of each template so the drill bit catches and stays in place.",
    "Screw the handle pieces onto the door and frame with the provided hardware.",
    "Find the pieces of your storm door handle in the packaging and assemble them following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
    "Push the pieces of the handle into the holes you drilled, making sure the interior and exterior pieces are on the correct sides.",
    "Use a screwdriver to secure the pieces in place.",
    "The type of handle on your storm door depends on the model you buy.",
    "Some may be more complex to assemble than others.",
    "Slide the sweep onto the bottom of the storm door so it\u2019s flush with the threshold.",
    "The sweep is a U-shaped metal piece that prevents drafts from coming underneath the storm door.",
    "Open your storm door and slide the sweep onto the bottom, using the screws and guide holes provided to secure it in place.",
    "Close your door to make sure the sweep extends completely down to the threshold so it forms a tight seal.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t form a tight seal, loosen the screws holding the sweep in place and push it down until it contacts the threshold.",
    "Position the closer mount on the side of the door frame and screw it in.",
    "Find the mounts for the pneumatic closer and find the one labeled \u201cFrame.\u201d Hold the mount against your door frame where you want to install the closer, and mark where the holes are so you know where to drill.",
    "Use a drill bit that\u2019s \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) smaller than your screws for the holes.",
    "Then put the mount back over the holes and screw it into place.",
    "You can put the closer anywhere along the side of the door that has the hinges.",
    "If you want to access it easily, put it at waist-height or the bottom of the door.",
    "Otherwise, you can attach it to the top of the door if you like.",
    "Secure the closer to the mount with the locking pin.",
    "Grab the new closer tube for your storm door and locate the side that has a rod that extends out.",
    "Put the rod end of the tube in the mount and slide one of the locking pins through the mount to hold it in place.",
    "The closer should stay in place so you can figure out where to place your other mount on the door.",
    "You may need to screw in the locking pin or secure a nut to it so it doesn\u2019t move or come loose.",
    "Attach the other closer mount to the storm door so it has slight tension.",
    "Pull the rod out about \u20442\u2013\u20444 inch (1.3\u20131.9 cm) so it has a slight amount of tension and secure it in place with the square metal tab.",
    "Attach the other mount to the tube with the locking pin and hold it against your storm door.",
    "Screw the mount into the storm door to secure it in place.Tip: Test opening and closing the door to make sure it swings back slowly when you let go of it.",
    "If it slams shut, loosen the screws on the door mount and reposition it closer to the hinges so it doesn\u2019t have as much tension."
