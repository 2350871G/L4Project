Waffle darts are the more favored type of darts in the Nerf hobby, shown to be some of the most accurate and cheapest darts of lasting quality.

Try not to shoot facing the wind and always try to circle around your target until the wind is hitting your back, then shoot. The extra push from the wind will help the dart fly harder, farther, and straighter."
