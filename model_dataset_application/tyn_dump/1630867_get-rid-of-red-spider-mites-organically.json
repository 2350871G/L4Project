Spray plants thoroughly, repeating every four to seven days until spider mites appear gone. Gentle soap, such as baby shampoo, may be better because heavier soaps like dish detergent can damage plants. However, you can use a harsher soap as long as you test it on a small area of the plant first, making sure the solution doesn't burn the leaves. Cooking oil will smother the insects and help the solution stick to the leaves. Be careful not to spray solution on plants when you notice beneficial insects as this will harm them as well, and avoid spraying when the sun is directly on the leaves as it will likely dry up the solution."

Spray on the bottom of leaves, keeping it away from your face, and shaking frequently to prevent ingredients from settling. Always test solution on a small portion of the plant to make sure it doesn't harm the leaves. To make an even stronger solution, add minced onion and garlic."

Mix a solution of these oils in a one liter bottle, filling half of it with lukewarm water and then adding 10 to 20 milliliters (0.34 to 0.68  fl oz) of essential oil. Some oils you might use are: \nNeem oil\nEucalyptus oil\nLemon oil\nCinnamon oil\nPeppermint oil\nRosemary oil\nChrysanthemum oil\nThyme oil\n\nFor oils with a gentle smell, use higher concentrations, and those with a stronger smell, use lower concentrations.
