The method used depends on what you have available and what you prefer by way of taste and texture. Whichever method you choose, after taking the patties out of the fridge, spritz them with a little cooking oil or brush them with some melted butter before cooking. Here are the different methods you can use:\n\nBroiler/grill: Preheat the broiler (upper level grill) to medium heat. Line a broiler pan with foil, for easier cleanup after cooking. Place the burgers in the broiler pan. Broil them for 6-7 minutes on each side or until thoroughly cooked. Frying pan or skillet: Add oil or butter to the pan and fry the burgers well. Be sure to use low heat and a long cook to properly cook the burgers the whole way through. Place the burgers on the barbecue grill. Cook as usual for hamburgers on the barbecue. Bake: Place in the oven on 350\u00baF/180\u00baC for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness. You may like to flip them over halfway, testing doneness regularly."

Ask the butcher to grind the meat twice, once in the coarse plate of the grinder and then through the fine plate. Place the ground beef in a bowl. You'll add the other ingredients to it when you're ready. Roughly chop the onion and garlic. Put them in a bowl and mix them together until combined. Add any of the ingredients you want to add to the burger. This includes the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, mustard, and the chopped herbs. These ingredients are optional, but they can add a special flavor to the meat. Add the egg yolk. Season one egg yolk with salt and pepper and mix everything together. It is easier to start mixing with a spoon; then use your clean hands to thoroughly combine the ingredients. Create the burgers. Handle the meat as little as possible, so you don\u2019t squeeze out the juices. Shape the mixture into 6 equal-sized balls using your hands.
