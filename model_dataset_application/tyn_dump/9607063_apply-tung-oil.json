          "description":"If you\u2019re working with an object that\u2019s already treated with a varnish or lacquer, you\u2019ll need to remove it before you can apply the tung oil. Mix 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of TSP into 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water and use a brush or sponge to spread the liquid over the entire surface. Avoid handling the surface until it\u2019s had time to dry. TSP is a highly-effective deep cleaner, but it\u2019s also highly toxic. Always make it a point to wear long-sleeved clothing, rubber gloves, and a respirator or facemask anytime you\u2019re working with the chemical. It\u2019s also a good idea to do your stripping in an area with good ventilation (or outside, if possible) to prevent the fumes from becoming overpowering."

This will smooth out imperfections and inconsistencies in the grain. Be sure to sand each and every part of the item you\u2019ll be finishing, including corners, edges, and recessed nooks.

The surface should be entirely free of debris before you begin applying the oil. If the wood is damp, allow it to dry to the touch before proceeding. Use a thin dry brush to coax stubborn particles out of creases and grooves. Any dust left behind may create imperfections in the finish."

With it in place, you'll be able to work quickly and efficiently without worrying about making an oily mess. When you're finished, simply take your cover outside and spray it off. You can also stretch out a few sheets of newspaper if you don't have a tarp or dropcloth on hand. Rich natural oils like tung oil can leave permanent stains if they find their way onto absorbent materials."
