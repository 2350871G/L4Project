Avoid adding too much liquid, however, or the soap won't dry properly. If you want something extra-special, try tea or milk instead. You can also try goat's milk or buttermilk.

Make sure that you scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. If you are using a crockpot, cover it with a lid and set it to high heat.

If your soap is already scented, you might want to skip this step, or use a similar fragrance. For example, if your soap base is lavender scented, you could add in an extra drop of lavender oil. You don't need to use as much essential oil as fragrance oil. This is because essential oil is much more potent. Do not use candle making fragrance oil. It is not skin safe.
