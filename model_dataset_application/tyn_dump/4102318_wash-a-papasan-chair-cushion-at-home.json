The key here is to dry the cushion as fast as possible so no mold will grow inside it. If you are using two box fans then set one of the fans in front of the cushion and one in the back. If you are drying the cushion on a flat surface be sure to turn the cushion every few hours so both sides get drying time. Leave the fans set up and running until the cushion is dry. To test to see if the cushion still has moisture left in it, you can put a paper towel in the suspected area and then sit/step on it. If the paper towel gets wet then the cushion still needs to be dried more."
