          "description":"Vinyl flooring can be placed in a variety of rooms, so the things you have to remove will vary depending on where you are placing your vinyl. Take out any free-standing furniture, and then move on to appliances. In a kitchen, you\u2019ll need to remove the fridge and stove/oven (if they are not built in types), and in a bathroom you need to take out the toilet. Then, remove the baseboards/trim along the bottom edge of the wall. You don\u2019t need to remove any cabinets or vanities, as these are typically in permanent locations and the flooring can be installed around them."

          "headline":"Take out the old flooring.",
          "description":"This step is primarily necessary if you have carpet that you are replacing with vinyl; vinyl flooring can cover nearly any floor surface, so long as it is rigid, flat, smooth, and dry. Pull up the old floor, and remove the threshold strips that trim out the doorways. The next step, although tedious, is very important: work along the subfloor, pulling out (or hammering in) any and staples and nails that you encounter that are not driven below the floor surface. You can pull a metal trowel across the floor and listen for the \u2018tink!\u2019 sound that happens when you hit a nail or staple, making it easier to find them. Old  flooring and floor adhesives may contain asbestos, so call your county for an asbestos test before pulling it or disturbing it. If your county building or environmental office doesn't offer this service, consult a private testing laboratory to find out how to gather samples and have them test them. If you choose not to remove the old flooring (if, for example, you\u2019re putting vinyl over concrete or wood), just know that the floor will be a bit higher, and you might have to trim the bottom of your doors to accommodate the height."

          "description":"Making a template of the floor will allow you to get precise measurements, and may make cutting your plywood/vinyl much easier than going without. Cut heavy construction paper into large strips, and lay it across your floor. Cut out any corners or built-in obstacles, and add measurements. Do this with multiple pieces of paper, until you've covered your entire floor. Then, tape all the pieces of paper together to form a full sized copy of the floor. You may need to do this in sections if you\u2019re working with a large room or floor space. You can measure hard-to-reach areas of flooring and draw/cut it onto the paper, if it is easier."

The underlayer is a \u00bc-inch thick layer of plywood that smooths out the floor and provides a sturdy base for the vinyl. Tape your paper template of the floor to your underlayer plywood. Use this as a guide, and cut  the plywood to fit the flooring in your room. Carefully cut your plywood in sections that match up, checking for fit with each completed piece. Only use vinyl-floor grade underlayer plywood, or else it won\u2019t hold up. Rough-cut the underlayer first, and then make more detailed cuts after fitting each piece."

Place the underlayer in it\u2019s final location, so that the wood fits  the space."

You should never use nails or screws in the underlayer, as these will cause bumps in the vinyl flooring. Work your way across the room, stapling the underlayer to the floor. Remove and replace any staples that don\u2019t go all the way through the plywood."

Then, use a leveling compound to fill in these spaces and any cracks in the underlayer. This will help to provide a smooth underlayer, which is vital to having a smooth final application of your vinyl. Follow the package directions for applying the floor leveling compound and make sure it is compatible with both the underlayer and the vinyl adhesive you will be using."

If you have vinyl sheets, all you have to do is cut it out to fit the room, allowing for seams if the room is wider than the sheet. Vinyl tiles, on the other hand, must be applied in a pattern. It\u2019s typically easiest to apply vinyl in rows, but you may want to change the direction of the rows (for example, have them go diagonally across the room). #Determine how you will lay the floor. You may strike a chalk line as a guide to the first row of vinyl (if you are using tiles.

Self-stick vinyl is very straight forward, as it comes with an adhesive backing that you use to stick it to the floor. Glue down vinyl takes a bit more work, as it requires you to put a layer of vinyl flooring glue on the underlayer prior to placing your vinyl.

Generally a 1/16 inch trowel is used for spreading the adhesive, some adhesives may also be applied with a short-napped paint roller. Start in a corner of the room (following your pattern), and scoop out some of the glue onto the trowel. Spread this across the underlayer in one section of the room, and then wait a few minutes for the \u2018open\u2019 time to set; laying the vinyl right away will cause air bubbles to form as the solvents evaporate from the adhesive. Always have a damp rag at the ready for spills or smears on the vinyl.
