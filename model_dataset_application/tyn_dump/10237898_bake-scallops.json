Torn and squished scallops are often mishandled and not fresh. Wet-packed scallops are the most commonly sold and are more affordable. However, their meat is typically tougher because they\u2019ve absorbed more water. Dry-packed scallops are very fresh when they\u2019re sold, but spoil more quickly. Diver-caught scallops are very expensive but environmentally friendly. Instead of dredging up the ocean floor to collect scallops, the divers hand pick them. Bay scallops are smaller and sweeter than sea scallops but aren\u2019t as common. You can also buy frozen scallops, but they\u2019re less likely to be fresh. If you buy frozen scallops, make sure to thaw them by leaving them overnight in the refrigerator or sealing them in a plastic bag and running cold water over them."
