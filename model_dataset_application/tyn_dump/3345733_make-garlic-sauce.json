Both reactions indicate that the fat has begun to break down, which could affect the taste of the finished sauce."

Place the garlic cloves on your chopping board one at a time. Position the flat side of the knife over the garlic clove and give the other flat side a firm, forceful smack with the palm or heel of your hand. The garlic should now be crushed. Discard the skin. Sprinkle a little salt on the cutting board to soak up any juices and roughly chop the garlic into small pieces using the sharp edge of your knife."

          "description":"Place the crushed garlic into the hot, melted butter and cook, stirring continuously, until the garlic begins to turn light brown. The garlic should also take on a stronger scent once it has cooked long enough. This is a quick process and will usually take no longer than 1 or 2 minutes. Watch the garlic carefully as you cook it. Garlic can burn rapidly, and once the garlic burns, the taste of the sauce will be ruined. You will not be able to salvage the sauce and will need to start over if this happens."
