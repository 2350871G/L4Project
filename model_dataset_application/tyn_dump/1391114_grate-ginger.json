Remember to try and remove as little of the skin as possible. Alternatively, you can use the edge of a spoon to scrape the peel off of fresh ginger. This works especially well on the rounded knobs that may be difficult to reach with a knife."

It doesn\u2019t matter if it is handheld or a box grater. Avoid graters that have metal nubs or teeth because they will be inefficient and overall more time-consuming. These graters can be bought at many big-box or cooking specialty stores. Hold the peeled ginger root so the fibers are perpendicular to the grater.
