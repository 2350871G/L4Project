Make sure your drip pans are completely cool before you remove them from the stove. If there are any loose crumbs in the drip pans, shake them off into the garbage before rinsing the pans."

          "description":"Vinegar works as a great cleaning agent because its acidity can dissolve soap scum and other buildup on various surfaces. Get a spray bottle and fill half of it with vinegar, then fill the remaining half with water. When you\u2019re finished, add 5 drops of lemon essential oil, which works as a disinfectant and stain remover. You can also add a couple of drops of dish soap for extra grease-fighting power. Shake the mixture to combine all of the ingredients. You can use orange essential oil instead of lemon if you\u2019d like. Orange essential oil helps with degreasing and has a great scent. If you don\u2019t have any essential oils on hand, you can use a few drops of lemon juice instead. A solution of just vinegar and water will also work well. Citrus essential oils will eat through plastic, so if your spray bottle is plastic, make sure to rinse it thoroughly when you\u2019re finished cleaning."

Pour a generous amount of baking soda all over your drip pans, making sure the entire surface is covered. Apply most of the baking soda to areas that are heavily soiled and have grease stains. Place some newspaper or paper towels under your drip pans to minimize the mess."

As you spray, the baking soda will start to fizz, which indicates that the baking soda and vinegar are reacting to each other. Spray it liberally so that the entire drip pan is soaked with the mixture. After spraying the vinegar mixture, add additional baking soda to any spots you may have missed or have thinned out. After you add another coat of baking soda to those areas, go back over it with the vinegar spray."
