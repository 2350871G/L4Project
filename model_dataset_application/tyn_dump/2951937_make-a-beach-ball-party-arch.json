          "description":"Locate an area at your party that will make a good space for the arch. This will allow you to determine how big the arch will be, and how many beach balls and inner tubes will be needed. You can create the arch as a backdrop piece for photo ops, or as something your guests will walk through. If you plan for people to walk through the arch, consider the height of your guests. If you don't know the height of your guests, 6\u20137 feet (180\u2013210 cm) is a good size. You may want to look for an area that offers some support for the arch, such as an existing doorway. The arch should be self-standing, but any additional support can be helpful."

          "description":"Place one end of a piece of rope on the ground where the arch will begin, and place a rock on top of it. Then run the rope along the area where you imagine the arch (use a friend and/or a step-stool to help you). Make a mark on the rope where it reaches the ground on the other side. Then lay your rope out straight and use your tape measure to determine the length. To determine the size of your arch, you will need a long piece of rope or twine, a tape measure, a marker, and a rock. You may also need the help of a friend and a ladder or step-stool."

Then you will alternate between beach balls and small inner tubes, making your way across the arch. In order to know how many of each you'll need, you need to select your materials and measure them. The most common size of beach ball is 11.2 inches (28 cm), but they are also available in 16 inches (41 cm), 24 inches (61 cm), and other sizes. Inner tubes are available in a wide variety of sizes and thicknesses. You may need to purchase a few inner tube options and then measure them blown up.

Let\u2019s say your arch is going to be 20 feet (6.1 m) long, from end to end. Your beach balls are 16 inches (41 cm), your large inner tubes are about 10 inches (25 cm) thick, and your small inner tubes are about 6 inches (15 cm) thick. In this example, your math would look like this:\nSo 20 feet (6.1 m) is 240 inches (610 cm). This is the total size of your arch. Your bases subtract 20 inches (51 cm), which leaves 220 inches (560 cm). The center beach ball (the one that makes the total number odd) subtracts 16 inches (41 cm), which leaves 204 inches (520 cm). Each beach ball-inner tube pair equals 22 inches (56 cm), and 204 inches (520 cm) divided by 22 inches (56 cm) equals 9.27, which we can round up to 10. (If you round down, you won't have an even number.) For a 20 foot (6.1 m) arch with these beach balls and inner tubes, you will need about 11 balls, 10 small inner tubes, and 2 larger inner tubes."
