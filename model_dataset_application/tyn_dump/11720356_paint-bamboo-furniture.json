Use a screwdriver or pair of pliers to pull the fasteners out from the furniture and set them aside while you\u2019re working so you don\u2019t lose them. Put the cushions and upholstery in an area where they won\u2019t get dirty. If you\u2019re working on a desk or dresser, remove the drawers and take off any handles or hardware on the exterior surface.Tip: Reupholster the cushions with a different fabric or pattern if you want them to match the furniture\u2019s new color."

          "description":"Apply slight pressure as you rub the entire surface with the sandpaper. Be careful not to press too hard since you could crack the bamboo if it\u2019s old or weak. Work in circular motions to strip the outer protection from the bamboo so the primer and paint adhere to it. Try to evenly sand the bamboo as best as you can so the color looks consistent. If the furniture was previously painted, be sure to sand the paint off completely. Avoid using an electric sander since you could break the bamboo. Bamboo has a slippery surface, so your paint won\u2019t stick to it unless you sand the furniture."

Shake the brush off into a trash can every few minutes so you don\u2019t reapply the sawdust to the surface.
