  "text":" Spraying with Water Fill a plastic spray bottle with water. Use a medium-size spray bottle as opposed to a cup or bucket to prevent splashing or excessive steam. Make sure there's enough water inside the spray bottle to extinguish the fire and dampen the firewood. Spread the firewood and embers in the fireplace with a fire poker. You want the firewood and embers to be as open and flat as possible so they cool faster. Spray the fire with water using the spray bottle. Continue spraying until you've covered all of the firewood and embers. You want everything to be damp so the wood and embers cool down and go out. Make sure the fire is out before you leave it unattended. There should be no flames or red, burning embers. If the fire restarts or the firewood and embers are still glowing hot, spray more water onto the fire. Using Baking Soda Use a fire poker to spread around the burning wood and embers. Try to create a flat, even layer that you can easily pour the baking soda over. Scoop up some ash with a metal shovel and dump it over the firewood. Continue doing this until all of the flames are extinguished. Pour baking soda over the embers and firewood. Use any kind of store-bought baking soda; you just want enough of it to create a thin layer over the embers and wood. Baking soda contains sodium bicarbonate, which is also found in some fire extinguishers, and it will help smother the fire so it doesn't restart. Avoid using sand to smother a fire as it will be difficult to clean out of the fireplace. Watch the fireplace for a few minutes to make sure the fire doesn't restart. If the fire restarts, repeat the ash and baking soda steps until the fire is completely out. Removing the Ashes Wait several hours after the fire's been put out to remove the ashes. This will allow the ashes time to cool down. Never try to remove the ashes when the fire is still going. To give the ashes more time to cool down, leave them in the fireplace overnight. It's OK to leave the ashes unattended while you sleep, as long as the fire is completely out (there are no flames or red embers). Use a metal shovel to scoop up the ashes. Don't worry about getting out any leftover wood; you just want to clear out the gray and black ash on the bottom of the fireplace. Remember that some embers may still be hot, even after the fire has been out for a while. Be careful when you're removing the ashes. Dump the ash into a metal can. Never dump ash into a paper, cardboard, or plastic container. Hot embers in the ash could burn through the container and start a fire. Take the can filled with ash outside to a safe area.
