Draw a model of your space\u2014sketch the walls and mark the doorways. Sketch the appliances, sinks, and faucets. The location of appliances, sinks, and fixtures must be added to your diagram.

Countertops are highly customizable. The unique touches you select may alter your quote and therefore should be noted in your diagram. Choose an edge type for your countertops: \u20448 inch (1.0 cm) rounded solid surface, eased stone, bevel stone, ogee stone, or bevel solid surface. Mark any sweeps, or rounded overhangs. Measuring Your Existing Countertops Measure the length of your existing countertops in inches. To measure the length of one section of countertops, run a measuring tape flush along the back edge of the section from one end to the other end.
