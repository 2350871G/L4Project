Put the base into position wherever you\u2019d like in the room. Tie 2 balloons together at the tails, and attach the pair of balloons with another pair to form a cluster. Tie the cluster of balloons onto your balloon arch using fishing line, and continue to fill the arch with clusters of balloons until it is completely covered. This creates a festive archway or accent piece. Use balloons in your color scheme so everything matches. For instance, if throwing a party for a young boy, use red, blue, and green."

Thread 1 end of the string through a yarn needle, and pierce the needle through the plastic tail of the balloon. Scoot the balloon down the string, and add several more balloons to fill the garland. Use tape to secure both ends of the garland to a wall, table, or doorway. Once you hang the garland, you can reposition the balloons as you\u2019d like. For instance, make a 5 ft (1.5 m) balloon garland and hang it around your cake and gift table."

Continue piercing the tails of the remaining balloons until they are all attached to the zip tie. Connect the zip tie ends, and pull it as tight as you can. Hang the cluster of balloons to the walls or from the ceiling using clear string. Use 1 color of balloons for each cluster, and make 3-5 different balloon clusters for a colorful, festive decoration.
