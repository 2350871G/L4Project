          "description":"One of the simplest ways to prevent a cake from doming is to ensure that the pan is filled evenly and is not overfilled with batter. Follow the recipe's instructions on pan size with care; the author of the recipe should have clarified the appropriate pan size for the amount of batter created. If this is not clear, there are cake capacity charts available but a general rule is to fill pans of a depth of 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5cm) halfway with batter and pans that are 3 to 4 inches (7.5-10cm) deep two-thirds the way with batter. With more experience, you'll get used to eyeballing the correct level and you'll instinctively know when it has been overfilled. This is especially important if you're baking 3 or more cakes, such as for layered cake batters. Measure each portion of the cake batter when you fill each separate pan. Use identical cake pans for each cake to be baked and set these on a scale when you pour in the batter. Measure the exact same amount of batter into each pan to ensure even baking. If you accidentally put more batter into 1 pan than another, it will puff up and crown more than the other, so scoop out any excess."

Instead, bake your cake at 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) because it will rise more slowly in the oven. This can prevent a crown or dome from forming.
