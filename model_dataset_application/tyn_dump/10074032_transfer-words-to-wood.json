Create your text first, then select it and change the font size and font type to whatever you want. The color of the text does not matter. You can even use an option that just gives you the outline. You can also find pre-made text online or even sketch your own on a sheet of printer paper."

The type of printer does not matter here, so you can use a laser or an inkjet printer. Make sure that you use printer paper; you can even use binder paper in a pinch. Don't use cardstock, however, or it will be too thick for the transfer to work. Skip this step if you sketched your own text."

          "headline":"Cover the back of the paper with graphite.",
          "description":"A thick, graphite stick will get the job done a lot faster, but you can use a pencil too. Be sure to press hard so that the graphite turns shiny. You do not need to cover the entire paper; just focus on the letters. It would be best to cover the entire letter rather than just the outline. You should be able to see the letters through the back of the paper. If you can't you could place the paper against a bright window, but this is not really necessary. If the wood is dark-colored, the graphite won't show up. Use chalk instead. You don't need a thick layer because it is so powdery."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Tape the paper graphite-side-down on your piece of wood.",
          "description":"Set the paper down so that the graphite is touching the wood, and the letters are facing up. Move the paper around until you are happy with the position, then tape down the corners. It does not matter what type of tape you use, as long as it holds the paper in place."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Trace the letters with a pencil, pressing hard.",
          "description":"As you trace, the pressure will cause the graphite under the paper to stick to the wood. Wherever you press with the pencil, the graphite will transfer. Lift the corner of the paper to check your progress. The lines will be faint, but you should still be able to see them. You do not need to fill in the letters since you'll be painting them anyway."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Remove the paper, then go over the letters, if needed.",
          "description":"The lines will be faint and ghostly, which is fine. If you are having troubles seeing the letters, trace over them with a pen or pencil so that you can see them more clearly. You'll be using these letters as stencils for the painting step. If you are using a pen, choose a color that matches the paint."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Paint the letters with acrylic paint.",
          "description":"Wide, flat brushes are ideal for block letters, while thin, pointy brushes work better for cursive. If you don't feel comfortable painting, you can use paint pens instead. If the wood is smooth, you may be able to color the letters in with permanent markers instead. The paint will cover the graphite/chalk marks, so don't worry."

          "headline":"Let the paint dry.",
          "description":"This should only take about 15 to 20 minutes. Once the paint has dried, you can display your wooden piece. For a longer-lasting finish, coat it with a clear, acrylic sealer. Acrylic sealer comes in matte, glossy, and satin finishes, so choose wisely!"

It is important to reverse the text, otherwise it will come out backwards. Choose a nice font and font size. The text will come out lighter on the wood, so dark, bold, or bright colors will look the best. Do not use white. There is no such thing as white printer ink, so it won't print.
