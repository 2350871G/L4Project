Use a pry bar to pull up hardwood floors one section at a time, or unfasten carpet or laminate and roll it up from one end. This will expose the subfloor underneath, which is where most leveling problems lie. You can leave linoleum or sheet vinyl in place if it\u2019s difficult to remove or if removal would damage the sub-floor. Apply bonding agent and floor leveling compound on top of the existing floor. Stripping tile can be a messy, laborious, time-consuming job. Unless you\u2019re an experienced contractor, it may be best to leave tile removal to the professionals. To remove carpet, cut it into smaller pieces using a razor knife. Then, pull it up. If you\u2019re installing a new floor, skip to checking the level and making a note of where the foundation should be worn down or built up."

This will give you an idea of how much work you\u2019ve got cut out for you, and where it\u2019s needed most. A good general rule of thumb is that the foundation shouldn\u2019t slope more than \u204416 inch (0.48 cm) every 10 feet (3 m). If the area is very large, use a long, straight 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) board and set your level on top of it. If the floor is uneven, lift up the board until it is level so you\u2019ll know how much flooring compound you\u2019ll need to even it out. Floors are rarely perfectly level. It\u2019s okay if the angle is off by a fraction of an inch in either direction.
