  "text":" Prepare to Bleed the Furnace Turn the furnace off before starting any work on the fuel pump. Depending on your model, you may need to flip a switch near your furnace or turn it off at the breaker. You should also turn off the gas using the shut-off valve connected to the gas line. Locate the bleed screw on the fuel pump near where the fuel line comes in. The screw is usually a small nipple-like screw. Place a small bucket or pan under the bleed screw. The bucket will catch any fuel that sputters out as you bleed an oil furnace. If the screw is in an area that is impossible to put a bucket or small tray under, use a flexible tubing just big enough to fit over the bleed screw. Place the tube over the bleed screw and direct it to an area where you can fit the tray or bucket. Bleed the Furnace Use a small crescent wrench or pliers to slightly loosen the bleed screw. Make sure the screw remains on the pump and is only a little loose, so it doesn\u2019t fall completely off when you bleed the oil furnace. Push the reset button on the furnace to turn it back on.
