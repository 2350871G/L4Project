  "text":" Fried Chicken Escalopes Prepare the escalopes. Remove the skin and tendons from the chicken. Put the chicken fillets between two sheets of plastic food wrap or parchment paper and pound with a rolling pin. The aim is to flatten them evenly to about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) (1/2\") in depth. The flattened pieces are now known as escalopes. Dice the bread. Add the diced pieces to the food processor and process into breadcrumbs. Pour them into a shallow, wide bowl or dish. Season the escalopes with salt and pepper to taste. Brush each escalope with mustard and sprinkle over the chopped fresh herbs. Dip each escalope into the beaten egg. Be sure to coat both sides evenly. Dip and drag through the breadcrumbs. Seek to coat as thoroughly as possible. Heat the oil in the pan. Add about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) (1/2\") of oil to the pan. Add the coated escalopes. Fry in the shallow oil for about 4\u20135 minutes. They are done when they are brown. Remove from the heat. Drain on paper. Serve. If you are cooking one at a time, keep the fried ones warm in the oven until serving time. Southern Fried Chicken Slice each breast and thigh diagonally to make 4 pieces.  Combine the mustard with the salt, pepper and cayenne. Brush the mixture over the chicken pieces. Place the chicken pieces into a bowl filled with the buttermilk. Turn around gently to coat in buttermilk. Prepare the bacon. Pour in the oil to a depth of 1 centimeter (0.39 in) (1/2\") and heat it. Cook the bacon until crisp. Lift the bacon out and leave to cool. Once it has cooled enough to handle, cut into small pieces. Mix the pieces of chopped bacon in with the breadcrumbs. Coat the buttermilk covered chicken with the bacon and breadcrumb mixture. Add more oil to the same pan you used for the bacon. Again, the depth of oil should be 1 centimeter (0.39 in) (1/2\"). Heat gently. It is important that the cooking oil temperature is not too hot because this can cause the outside to crisp before the inside is cooked. If you notice that the oil starts to smoke, it's too hot. Add a little more oil and reduce the temperature immediately. Add the chicken pieces. Fry for about 10 minutes. Turn once during the frying time. The amount of time needed for cooking will depend on the thickness of the pieces; a golden brown color is a good indication that the chicken is cooked. Remove from the pan and serve. Sprinkle with salt. Keep fried pieces warm in the oven until all are completed before serving. Original Fried Chicken Prepare the batter by placing eggs and milk into one bowl.  Combine the flour, breadcrumbs and seasonings into another bowl.  Dip each chicken piece, first, into the flour, then the batter, and again into the flour. Place the coated pieces on a plate. Add oil to a large, deep fryer. The fryer should be suitable for frying chicken. Heat on the stove at a medium setting. Watch to see that it does not get too hot and \"spit\". To test to see if the oil is hot, put your hands under the water faucet then flick the water from your fingers over the oil. If it sizzles, you know the oil is hot enough to add the chicken to fry. Remove from pan after  the chicken is a golden brown color.  Place on paper towels, on the counter top.  Serve. Serve with coleslaw, salad or steamed vegetables of choice. If you're going on a picnic, allow the fried chicken to cool down and pack in its own container, along with other food items ready for the outing. Fried Spring Chicken Assemble the items and tools needed to complete the recipe.  Cut the spring chicken into 6 pieces, namely 2 wings, 2 legs and 2 pieces of the breast.  Mix the 2 tablespoons of oil with the lemon juice. Add salt and pepper to taste, and a little cayenne. Add the finely chopped garlic clove, parsley and if using, the ground ginger.  Arrange the chicken pieces in a bowl or tray for marinating. Pour the marinade mixture over the chicken pieces. Leave for 30 minutes. Drain the chicken pieces.  Coat with breadcrumbs.  Heat deep frying oil to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF.  Add each piece to the deep frying oil. Cook for 13-15 minutes or until golden. Remove. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with a little more salt. Serve with the lemon quarters. Deep Fried Chicken Assemble the items and tools needed to complete the recipe.  Add the butter, lemon zest and tarragon into a bowl. Cream together. Add the lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the butter on a piece of foil. Shape it into a rectangular piece. Wrap this rectangular block and place in the freezer. Remove only when it has set solid. Flatten the chicken breast into an escalope (see method above under \"Fried chicken escalopes\").  Remove the frozen butter. Cut it into four even pieces. Place each piece of butter inside an escalope, completely enveloping it. Roll each fillet tightly over the butter. Keep the butter-filled chicken fillet intact by piercing each end with a toothpick.  Crack the egg and beat it lightly. Dip the chicken pieces into the egg to coat evenly. Roll the egg-covered chicken pieces in the breadcrumbs. Be sure it is evenly covering the chicken; you may need to press them into place. Refrigerate the breadcrumb covered chicken fillets. The coating must set before removing them. Heat the oil in the deep-frying pan. It should reach a temperature of 190\u00baC/375\u00baF. Do not use it if it is hotter than this or it will cook the outside of the chicken but not the meat. Add the chicken pieces in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 10 minutes. They can be removed when they are golden brown. Keep cooked pieces warm in the oven. Drain on kitchen paper.  Serve. Remember to remove the cocktail sticks before serving. When cut open, the buttery insides should melt out deliciously. Keeping Fried Chicken Warm Put a little water in an oven dish, wad up some tin foil into balls.  Line over the top of the tin foil balls with a large piece of tin foil big enough to wrap all the fried chicken in.  Cover all with a lid and place in the oven on 150-200\u00baF/65-95\u00baC. Now you have made a homemade steamer pan. Keep chicken in the oven until it is ready to eat. It will come out really tender.",
