If you have, for example, a tall mirror in your bedroom that you use to inspect your outfit before heading out the door to work, or a small mirror in your bathroom that you use to shave or apply makeup, don\u2019t hang a wreath on these mirrors.

If you\u2019d like to hang a wreath over a round mirror, use a smaller wreath so that it doesn\u2019t cover the entire mirror. For example, if your wreath has a 24 in (61 cm) diameter, hang it over a mirror that\u2019s at least 28 in (71 cm) across. Alternately, you can use a round mirror and a wreath as a horizontal decoration. Place the round mirror flat on a coffee table or dining room table, and place the wreath on top of the mirror. Anchor it in place with adhesive felt pads. Set a couple of votive candles in the center to finish the decoration."

    "Look for a color that goes well with the color of the decorations on your wreath.",
    "For example, you could choose a color of purple ribbon that complements the green.",
    "Or, if your wreath is covered in silver balls, choose a metallic gold ribbon.",
    "Avoid colors that clash.",
    "So, if your wreath has lots of red Christmas balls on it, don\u2019t use a bright yellow ribbon.",
    "Cut a 2 ft (0.61 m) long strip of ribbon.",
    "Use a pair of scissors to snip through the ribbon you purchased.",
    "The length of the ribbon depends on how low you\u2019d like the wreath to hang on the mirror.",
    "If you\u2019re hanging the wreath on a tall mirror and would like it to be centered, you might need as much as 3 feet (0.91 m) of ribbon.",
    "With the extra ribbon, you could hang other wreaths over additional mirrors in your home!",
    "Staple 1 end of the ribbon to the back of the mirror.",
    "Remove the mirror from the wall.",
    "Set the piece of ribbon on the mirror so that 1 tip is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) down from the top of the mirror.",
    "Make sure that the rest of the ribbon is draped upward over the top of the mirror.",
    "Use a stapler to attach the end of the ribbon to the back of the mirror.",
    "If the staple won\u2019t stick very well into the back of the mirror, try stapling the ribbon to the back of the wooden frame itself.",
    "Loop the ribbon through the wreath\u2019s hole and hang the wreath.",
    "Pull 1 end of the ribbon through the hole in the wreath.",
    "You might need to fiddle with the ribbon a little so that it doesn\u2019t block any bells, balls, or other decorations on the wreath.",
    "Position the wreath where you\u2019d like it to stay over the mirror, and flip both loose ends of the ribbon over the top of the mirror.",
    "If the wreath has discernable top and bottom sides, make sure that the wreath will hang right-side-up once you\u2019ve looped the ribbon through its center.",
    "Try slipping the ribbon in between balls, lights, and other wreath decorations so it doesn\u2019t cover them up.",
    "Staple the other end of the wreath to the back of the mirror.",
    "Flip the loose end of the ribbon back over the top of the mirror.",
    "Using a stapler or a staple gun, staple the ribbon\u2019s loose end to the back of the mirror in the same spot that you stapled the first end.",
    "Now the wreath is ready for you and your guests to admire!",
    "When you want to take the wreath down, all you need to do is to remove the staples from the back of the mirror.",
    "Dealing with a Non-Removable Mirror Press a pushpin into the drywall above the mirror.",
    "Not all mirrors can be removed from the wall.",
    "If you\u2019d like to hang a wreath from a permanently mounted mirror, just stick a push pin into the wall about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) above the mirror.",
    "This works best if your wall is made from a relatively soft material like drywall.",
    "Hanging a wreath from a push pin is also a good option if your mirror is removable but sticking an adhesive hook on the back would make it stand out awkwardly far from the wall behind it.",
    "If the pushpin stands out against your wall, dip the head of the pin into a small bottle of acrylic paint the same color as your wall.",
    "Let the paint dry for about 20 minutes before touching the pushpin.",
    "Stick a suction cup on the top of the mirror if you can't put a pushpin in the wall.",
    "If your walls are made of brick, wood, or another substance that you won\u2019t be able to get a push pin into, using a suction cup is the best way to hang a wreath.",
    "Run the back of the suction cup under a trickle of water to dampen it.",
    "You can also try breathing on the back of the cup to fog it.",
    "Then stick it to the mirror about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down from the top.",
    "Purchase suction cups at any drugstore or large supermarket.",
    "Some pharmacies also sell suction cups.",
    "Hang the mirror using a loop of lightweight fishing line.",
    "Purchase a small spool of 3\u20134 lb (1.4\u20131.8 kg) fishing line from a hardware store.",
    "Use a pair of scissors to cut a 1\u20132 ft (0.30\u20130.61 m) section of line.",
    "Stick 1 end of the line through the wreath and tie the 2 ends in a knot.",
    "Loop the tied line over the push pin or suction cup at the top of your mirror.",
    "The fishing line will be practically invisible to any guests who visit your home and look at the wreath."
