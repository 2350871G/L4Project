Find a pair that is big enough so that the chain you want to cut will fit between the cutting blades when the cutters are in the open position.

Remember, the link you cut will be destroyed, so you should mark the link past the length that you need.

However, if you are cutting a large chain, you only want to put one side of the link between the blades at one time. Position the cutters so that you are cutting through the long side of the link. This will make it easier to position the cutters in place. Putting the link towards the back of the cutters will give you more leverage when cutting through it."
