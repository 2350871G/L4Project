At this point, everything is sketched in very lightly using a 4H pencil, which is one of your softer pencils. Shade the pupils in with a 6B pencil. This will make them really dark.

In other words, if the lines overlap, it\u2019s okay. Sketch the ears. Starting at the top of the head on one side, draw a puffy, oblong shape (almost like a half-donut).

Add your own unique touches now to turn it into the world\u2019s cutest puppy. Sketching a Simple Drawing of a Puppy Begin with the nose. Sketch a circle that\u2019s a little flat at the top and narrow at the bottom. Right in the middle of the circle at the bottom, draw a line about one-third up. Then draw two small circles, one on each side of the line, for the puppy\u2019s nostrils. Draw a curved line starting underneath the nose on one side and then on the other. This is the puppy\u2019s snout. Next, with one of your fingers, trace from the middle of one curved line up until it looks just right, and draw a circle for the eye. Do the same thing on the other side. Color in the middle of each eye for the pupils, leaving a little white area at the bottom. Visualize how far up you think you should draw the head. Once you have an idea, make an oblong shape for the head. Sketch it in using light, pencil strokes. If you see that it\u2019s a bit off, simply erase and lightly sketch it again. It sometimes takes a few times to get certain areas you are drawing just right. Draw the puppy\u2019s tongue hanging out of its mouth. Sketch it right underneath where you made the two curvy lines for the snout. You can either give the puppy a long, drooping tongue or with just the tip coming out. Both are cute. Sketch a large, triangle shape for the ears on each side of the head. The wide part will be at the top and the pointy part will be at the bottom. Though don\u2019t make them pointy. Make it a soft triangle. With multiple strokes, draw in some curvy lines for a droopy chin. Keep it in proportion to the entire head though. Then draw in a couple lines to give the puppy some wrinkles. Sketch a big, round shape on the left side of the body. The puppy is sitting on this side; that\u2019s why it\u2019s larger. Starting on the right side, draw a line down from the puppy\u2019s snout, then up and around on the other side of the body. Next, sketch out the front paw. You can\u2019t see the other paw, so just add a few curvy lines to indicate that it\u2019s there. Add a pointy tail, and there\u2019s your cute puppy! Drawing a Cartoon Puppy Start by drawing a circle for the puppy\u2019s head and an upward curving, noodle-shape for the body. The noodle shape should be drawn at an angle from the head. The shape for the body will be about the same size as the head just in a different shape. Next, draw a vertical line from the top of the circle to the bottom of it. Then draw another slightly curved line going horizontal across the bottom-third of the circle. When you\u2019re finished, your drawing will be of a puppy standing up. Draw his ears. Starting at the back of his head, draw two lines going out at an angle on each side. Then curve these same two lines down and around alongside his head. You want cute, perky ears so only come about a third of the way down. Sketch two egg shapes for the puppy\u2019s eyes on this horizontal line. Many cartoon characters start out with these same kinds of shapes. It just takes practice to understand the process. Then you\u2019ll have it down. Draw with light lines so you can easily erase them later if you need to. Draw a large, ellipse shape over one of the eyes. When you\u2019re finished, this will be a beautiful marking over one eye. Don\u2019t worry about shading. You\u2019ll do that later. Sketch the nose in a small, oblong shape. Draw it slightly above where the two lines cross in the circle. Make a smaller half-circle right below that for the mouth. Remember to sketch lightly in case you need to erase and redraw it later. Draw a horizontal, ellipse shape on the left lower side of the puppy\u2019s face. Sketch another ellipse on the other side. Basically, you are drawing two elongated noodles to represent the sides of the puppy\u2019s wide, smiling mouth. Next, where you drew the oblong shape for the nose earlier, right in the middle draw a smaller, triangular-shape to make a button nose. Draw the puppy's legs. For the front legs, draw the first one in an oblong shape. Make it larger at the bottom to give the puppy big paws. Sketch a few lines for nails. Draw the opposite leg but make it a little bit smaller since we see the other paw first. Now draw the back legs using the same oblong shape; make these legs a little smaller than the front. Most kitten and puppy cartoon characters have big paws, and it will make your puppy look extra-cute. Draw a long tongue. Sketch it coming out of the half-circle that you drew in an earlier step. Take your time. The tongue in a cartoon puppy is a cute feature. Now give your puppy a pointy, curvy tail. Erase all unnecessary lines. Using a soft pencil, outline the contours of the body. Shade in the ellipse around the one eye. Darken in the top of his back, ears and tail. Shade in the inside of his mouth and pupils. Lightly shade in the rest of his body, leaving the belly and paws white.",

    "When you\u2019re finished, your drawing will be of a puppy standing up.",
    "Draw his ears.",
    "Starting at the back of his head, draw two lines going out at an angle on each side.",
    "Then curve these same two lines down and around alongside his head.",
    "You want cute, perky ears so only come about a third of the way down.",
    "Sketch two egg shapes for the puppy\u2019s eyes on this horizontal line.",
    "Many cartoon characters start out with these same kinds of shapes.",
    "It just takes practice to understand the process.",
    "Then you\u2019ll have it down.",
    "Draw with light lines so you can easily erase them later if you need to.",
    "Draw a large, ellipse shape over one of the eyes.",
    "When you\u2019re finished, this will be a beautiful marking over one eye.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about shading.",
    "You\u2019ll do that later.",
    "Sketch the nose in a small, oblong shape.",
    "Draw it slightly above where the two lines cross in the circle.",
    "Make a smaller half-circle right below that for the mouth.",
    "Remember to sketch lightly in case you need to erase and redraw it later.",
    "Draw a horizontal, ellipse shape on the left lower side of the puppy\u2019s face.",
    "Sketch another ellipse on the other side.",
    "Basically, you are drawing two elongated noodles to represent the sides of the puppy\u2019s wide, smiling mouth.",
    "Next, where you drew the oblong shape for the nose earlier, right in the middle draw a smaller, triangular-shape to make a button nose.",
    "Draw the puppy's legs.",
    "For the front legs, draw the first one in an oblong shape.",
    "Make it larger at the bottom to give the puppy big paws.",
    "Sketch a few lines for nails.",
    "Draw the opposite leg but make it a little bit smaller since we see the other paw first.",
    "Now draw the back legs using the same oblong shape; make these legs a little smaller than the front.",
    "Most kitten and puppy cartoon characters have big paws, and it will make your puppy look extra-cute.",
    "Draw a long tongue.",
    "Sketch it coming out of the half-circle that you drew in an earlier step.",
    "Take your time.",
    "The tongue in a cartoon puppy is a cute feature.",
    "Now give your puppy a pointy, curvy tail.",
    "Erase all unnecessary lines.",
    "Using a soft pencil, outline the contours of the body.",
    "Shade in the ellipse around the one eye.",
    "Darken in the top of his back, ears and tail.",
    "Shade in the inside of his mouth and pupils.",
    "Lightly shade in the rest of his body, leaving the belly and paws white."
