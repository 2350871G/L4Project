The precision achieved with this type of welder is crucial when working with aluminum, especially thin pieces. TIG welders are expensive, so consider contacting a local welding supply store or home hardware outlet about rental possibilities. It\u2019s possible to weld aluminum with other welding processes, such as MIG welding, but TIG welding is the method most suitable for beginners."

You can find aluminum filler rods at hardware or home improvement stores, such as Harbor Freight or Home Depot. Opt for either a 4043 or 5356 alloy.

Gas needs to be acquired from authorized gas dealers. Most welding supply stores will be able to provide gas or refer you to an outlet that can. If you\u2019re renting the TIG welder, purchase your argon canister when you pick up the welder."

This equipment will protect you from intense light, radiation, chemical burns, fumes, oxides, electric shock, and more. Your welding gloves should be insulated and fire-resistant. Keep a fire extinguisher easily accessible in case of any stray sparks. Try to use a helmet with a lens that automatically darkens during the welding process.

So, before welding any piece of aluminum, you have to clean away the aluminum oxide. Do this mechanically by wire-brushing, grinding, or filing away the oxides. If you use wire brushes to clean the aluminum, make sure to use brushes that are new or have only been used to clean aluminum. Brushes that have been used to clean other metals may leave traces of those metals behind, which can affect the quality of your weld. Spray the joints with electrical cleaner. Rinse the work piece in water, and then allow it to dry thoroughly. Scrub the aluminum with a stainless steel wool scrubber, such as a Scotch Brite scrubbing pad, to finish the cleaning process."

Make the work pieces fit together as tightly as possible by filing them before clamping them together with clamps or vise grips. If you can, suspend the area you will be welding above the table. This will make the heat transfer more effective and create better weld penetration. Consider clamping the workpiece to a heat sink, such as copper. This will ensure that the heat from the weld will transfer safely without warping your work or damaging anything else in your workspace."

When welding thick pieces of aluminum, welding without preheating can lead to a very weak, shallow bond."

It\u2019s also important to work in a space below 77\u00b0 Fahrenheit (25\u00b0 Celsius) that has good airflow in order to prevent heat stress and/or inhalation of dangerous fumes.

    "Create the puddle.",
    "Melt the workpiece until you create an adequately-sized puddle that\u2019s no wider than double the diameter of your filler.",
    "Add just enough of the filler rod to fill in the joint, and then move to the next portion of the weld.",
    "Continue until the entire joint is welded properly.",
    "As you weld, heat will increase throughout the workpiece.",
    "Use your foot pedal to lower the amperage as you go to maintain control of the puddle.",
    "While you weld, pay close attention to your puddle size.",
    "If it\u2019s too big or too small, you may burn through your material or not get a solid weld.",
    "Add a little extra filler rod at the beginning of the weld.",
    "Weld for about \u00bc inch (6.35 mm), then stop and let things cool for a few seconds.",
    "After your weld has had a moment to cool, restart the weld.",
    "Having a little extra metal at the start of the weld will make your weld stronger and prevent cracking.",
    "Push the puddle.",
    "Slowly push the puddle that the torch creates down the joint, adding filler as you go.",
    "Move at an even pace to keep the puddle a consistent size.",
    "Let off the foot pedal and release the button on the torch.",
    "Once you\u2019ve finished your weld, stop the arc by slowly taking your foot off of the pedal.",
    "Then take your finger off of the button that\u2019s on the torch.",
    "Give the metal plenty of time to cool before you touch the finished product."
