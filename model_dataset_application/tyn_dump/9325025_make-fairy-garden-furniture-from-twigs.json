Use pruning shears to cut four 1-inch (2.5-cm) twigs. make sure that they are straight and all the same thickness. Hot glue the twigs side-by-side to make a square-shaped seat. Make sure that the ends of the twigs are lined up and straight. If there is any unevenness, lightly sand the ends of the twigs with sandpaper. Use twigs that are no thicker than \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). Cut two twigs a little longer than your seat for the supports. Measure across the lined up twigs.

Hot glue the supports across the seat, close to the narrow edges. Make sure that the bottom ends of the supports are flush with the front edge of the seat, and the top ends are extending past the back edge of the seat. Glue the supports about one twig width away from the narrow side edges. Cut two short twigs and two long twigs for the legs. Make the two front legs about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The back legs need to be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) long as they will also become the back supports. You can make them longer if you want, however. The front legs need to be straight. The back legs can be any shape you want, even curved or forked! Glue the front legs under the seat to either side of the supports. Place a drop of hot glue on the bottom of the seat and another on the outside edge of the support. Nestle one of the front legs into the glue, making sure that the end is touching the seat, and the side is touching the support. Repeat this step for the other front leg. Glue the front legs as close as possible to the front edge of the seat. Glue the back legs to the back edge of the seat. Place a drop of hot glue on the outside edge of the extended support, and another drop on the back edge of the seat (not under). Stand the seat up on its front legs, making sure that it is parallel to the ground. Slide the back leg into place. Repeat this step for the other back leg. Cut and glue 1 to 2 twigs for the backrest.

Twist some gold or copper wire around the back rest, and slip more beads onto it! Making a Table Saw a thin disk from a thick branch to make the table top. Choose a branch that is about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) thick. You will need to saw off the end of the branch first so that the table is nice and smooth. Next, use a hacksaw or a table saw to cut a 1\u20444 to 1\u20442-inch (0.64 to 1.27-cm) thick disk. Make marks on the branch with pen or pencil where you need to cut first.

Cutting three legs instead of four means that your table will be more stable and less likely to wobble, especially if the legs or ground are uneven. Drill three holes into the disk, if you want a stronger table. These holes will be for the table legs, so make sure that they are wide enough. Space the holes evenly in a triangular formation. If you can, drill the holes at an angle pointing towards the center of the table. Place a drop of glue into each hole. You can use hot glue, tacky glue, or wood glue. If you use hot glue, be prepared to work quickly as it sets up fast. If you didn't make the holes, place three drops of glue on the flat side of the disk in a triangular formation. Insert each twig into the glue. If you used tacky glue or wood glue, you may have to place something around the legs to support them. Little mounds of clay will work great for this, but you can also use pebbles or little pieces of wood. Turn the table right side up and decorate it as desired. Find a spot in your fairy garden and set it down. Add some acorn cap tea cups and leaf plates. You can even make a mini floral arrangement using seed pods, large beads, and tiny flowers. Making a Bed Cut and glue 6 to 8 twigs together to make the base of your bed. Use pruning shears to cut 6 to 8 twigs.
