Let your garment soak for about ten minutes, then hang your jeans outside to dry. Once they're dry, put them in your regular laundry cycle. Note that lemon juice can lighten your garments color.

    "Make a paste out of meat tenderizer.",
    "Due to its ability to break down proteins, meat tenderizer can be an effective blood stain remover.",
    "Use a quarter teaspoon of the meat tenderizer, add a little cold water, and mix it into a paste.",
    "Work the paste into the blood stain.",
    "Let it set in for about fifteen minutes, then rinse out your jeans.",
    "You can get meat tenderizer in any convenience store.",
    "If none of the above steps worked on your blood stain, give the last one below a chance.",
    "Get some hairspray.",
    "Hairspray can be another effective product to get rid of blood stains.",
    "Saturate the stained part with the hair product, and let it sit for about five minutes.",
    "Then, get a damp rag and gently wipe the stain clean.",
    "Removing Grease Blot the stain gently with a dry paper towel.",
    "Especially if the stain is fresh, your first instinct might be to wipe the stain with water.",
    "But as mentioned, H20 will only set the stain as oil repels water.",
    "A dry paper towel will instead soak up excess oil.",
    "This method might not be enough for big or deep-set stains.",
    "Try the steps below if the paper towel didn't fully absorb your stain.",
    "Cover the stain with baby powder or talc.",
    "This method is good for fresh and old stains.",
    "Powders efficiently absorb oil and can get rid of most oil-based stains.",
    "Particularly if your stain is just oil.",
    "Simply saturate the stain with baby powder or talc, and let the powder do its magic for as long as possible - up to an entire day.",
    "Then, lightly brush the powder off (with a dry paper towel, or toothbrush), and launder your jeans in the hottest temperature the garment care instructions allow.",
    "Use dish detergent.",
    "Due to its high level of surfactants, dish detergent is particularly successful at getting rid of grease and oil stains.",
    "Dab a drop or two onto your stain, and add a little water.",
    "With a rag/cloth, gently wipe the stain with the detergent and water until the stain is gone.",
    "Then, throw your jeans in the wash and launder them as usual.",
    "If you're on the go, the next step might be easier to implement.",
    "Use artificial sweeteners.",
    "They'll do a good job at removing oil and grease stains.",
    "Simply dab the stain with a little bit of the powder and a dry paper towel.",
    "Artificial sweeteners are particularly good when you're out and about.",
    "If none of the above steps worked for you, go ahead and try this last option below.",
    "Get a hold of white vinegar.",
    "Pour a small amount of undiluted white vinegar on a paper towel.",
    "Blot the stain right before washing your jeans.This method works best on old stains.",
    "Removing Makeup Stay away from water.",
    "Most makeup, like lip-stick or mascara, is oil-based which means that water will help the stain set, and make it harder to remove it.",
    "Brush the stain off gently.",
    "Some makeup isn't liquid, which means that it's sometimes possible to lightly brush a lip-stick or mascara stain off before it seeps into the fabric.",
    "But be very careful, as you don't want to grind the stain deeper into your jeans.",
    "If this wasn't enough, go ahead and try the next steps below.",
    "Use shaving cream.",
    "Shaving cream is especially useful for foundation spills.",
    "Just cover the stain with some shaving cream, and toss your garment into the wash.\nAs an alternative to this step, you might consider the next one.",
    "Get some hair spray.",
    "If you're dealing with lipstick stains, hairspray can be quite effective at removing spills and smudges.",
    "Saturate the stained part of your jeans with the hair product for about fifteen minutes.",
    "Then blot it with a damp rag or cloth until the stain is gone.",
    "If hairspray makes you cringe, or you don't tolerate the smell, skip to the method below.",
    "Use dish detergent.",
    "If you're dealing with spray tan or tinted moisturizer spots, make a mixture of warm water and a little dish detergent in a cup.",
    "Dip in a sponge and then gently blot your jeans' stain with it until your garment is clean.",
    "Removing Sweat And Yellowing Use vinegar.",
    "Concoct a mixture of two parts white vinegar, and one part water (cold or warm).",
    "Pour the mixture onto the stain, and let it soak overnight.",
    "Then, wash your garment as you normally would.",
    "Some people can't stand the smell of vinegar.",
    "If that's the case for you, skip ahead to one of the following options below.",
    "Get some baking soda.",
    "Create a paste out of baking soda and warm water.",
    "Use just enough baking soda and water to make a paste-like texture.",
    "Then, get an clean toothbrush and firmly apply the paste to the area.",
    "Gently scrub back and forth, then let the stain sit for a few hours.",
    "Finally, rinse the stain.",
    "Crush three Aspirin pills.",
    "Put them in a cup.",
    "Then, add about two tablespoons of water until the mixture becomes paste-like.",
    "Apply it onto the stain, and let it sit for an hour.",
    "Rinse the stained part of the garment.",
    "Get some lemon juice.",
    "Lightly sprinkle salt onto the stain.",
    "Then squeeze some lemon juice onto the stain until it's saturated.",
    "Rub the stain until it's gone, and then launder your jeans.",
    "This is a great preventative measure as well.",
    "You could use the mixture on shirts you know you'll sweat in (like gym shirts).",
    "Keep in mind that lemon juice might lighten your jeans' color.",
    "Removing Wine And Food Get a hold of white wine.",
    "It might seem counter intuitive, but white wine actually works great on red wine spots (they neutralize one another).",
    "Simply pour white wine over the red wine spot right before doing laundry.",
    "Then, toss your jeans in and wash normally.",
    "If this didn't work for you, try one of the steps below.",
    "Use table salt.",
    "Pour a little bit of salt onto the stain and let it sit for about five minutes.",
    "Rub the stain with a rag/cloth while rinsing it out with cold water, or club soda.",
    "Repeat this action until the stain vanishes.",
    "Then, wash your jeans.",
    "Get some eggs out.",
    "Egg yolks work particularly well on coffee stains.",
    "Mix one egg yolk with a couple of drops of rubbing alcohol and warm water.",
    "Take a sponge and apply the mixture to the coffee spot.",
    "Let it sit for a couple of minutes, then rinse.",
    "Wash your jeans as usual.",
    "Use club soda.",
    "Mix club soda and a teaspoon of salt in a cup, then apply it directly to the stain.",
    "Let it soak in overnight for best results.",
    "As previously mentioned, avoid all types of water on greasy stains.",
    "Club soda and salt work especially well on coffee stains.",
    "Removing Dirt Stains Keep it very simple for plain dirt stains.",
    "Turn your jeans inside out, and just flush out the spot from behind.",
    "Simply apply tepid water to the stain with a clean rag/cloth until the stain disappears.",
    "If this step wasn't enough to make your stain disappear, try one or more of the following steps below.",
    "Use shampoo.",
    "For old and deep-set stains, put your jeans in a plastic tub filled with warm water.",
    "Put some shampoo on a sponge, and scrub the stain vigorously while it's soaking in water.",
    "Repeat until the spot is gone.",
    "Add vinegar to your regular laundry cycle.",
    "Pour a cup of white vinegar to your laundry cycle, and run your wash.",
    "Adding white vinegar to your laundry acts similarly to bleach, but it's less aggressive.",
    "Note: this trick is only meant for white jeans.",
    "Brush the dirt stain lightly with a toothbrush.",
    "If the stain is fresh, and most importantly, not from completely liquid dirt you might be able to lightly brush the dirt of your jeans fabric.",
    "But be careful as rough brushing might help the dirt penetrate into the jeans."
