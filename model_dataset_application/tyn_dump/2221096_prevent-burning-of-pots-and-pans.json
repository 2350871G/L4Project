As a result, food cannot attach itself to the pans, which preventing it from burning the metal. Coat the pan with lard or solidified bacon grease. You must use a solid fat. Do not use vegetable oil. Put the pan into an oven preheated to 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C). Bake the pan for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and dump out excess, liquid grease. Place the pan back into the oven for another two hours. Remove the pan, and then repeat the process over once or twice more to make sure that the fat thoroughly seeps into the pores of the pan."

      "description":"Any pan, regardless of the material, should be treated with oil before you begin the cooking process. Like solid lard, oil seeps into the pores of the metal when exposed to high temperatures, creating a sort of nonstick coating. Pour enough oil into the pan to provide a thin coating over the bottom. Heat it over medium to medium-high heat. Add food only after thin wisps of vapor appear. The oil must be this hot in order to create a seep into the metal thoroughly enough to prevent sticking."

You can reduce the likelihood of this food burning your pots and pans by deglazing the cookware immediately after you finish cooking with it. Remove your used, empty cookware from the stove while it is still hot. Add 1 cup of cold water to the pot or pan. Return the cookware to the stove and heat the water over medium heat. Use a metal spatula to gently encourage burnt food to lift from the bottom. The heated water alone may be enough in many cases, but a metal spatula can assist you for more stubborn residue."
