Warm \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of vinegar in the microwave for 30 seconds, use it to dampen a sponge or clean rag, and scrub it over the scum. Let soak for 5 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. The vinegar may leave an unpleasant smell, but this should wash away after a shower or 2 after it dries. If your bathroom has poor ventilation, dilute the vinegar with equal parts water to prevent irritation of your eyes and sinuses. The soft side of the sponge is usually sufficient. The abrasive side is more effective, but can scratch some types of glass, especially if used repeatedly."

Most of these contain ammonia, which produces toxic and irritating fumes, so use only in small quantities and in well-ventilated areas. Spray on and let it sit for about 10 minutes, scrub hard with a sponge, and rinse off thoroughly. If your bathroom has poor ventilation, use an eco-friendly citrus-based glass cleaner. These tend to be less harmful to the eyes and lungs."

Pour about \u00bc cup (60 mL) baking soda into a cup and slowly mix in white vinegar one tablespoon (15 mL) at a time until a thick paste is formed. Scrub this onto the glass with a sponge, let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse off. The two ingredients will fizz when they come into contact with each other, but the gas produced is harmless. Don't pour the vinegar directly into the baking soda, or it could messily spray out of the container."
