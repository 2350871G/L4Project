The rest of the materials can be found at your local hardware store. When choosing a light bulb, find one that is around 15-25 volts so a single battery can power them.

Using wire strippers, remove about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the insulation from the ends of each wire. If you don\u2019t have wire strippers, you can carefully use scissors to cut off the insulation. Be careful not to cut all the way through the wire."

Attach the end of one wire to one side of the battery, making sure that the wire maintains contact with the metal of the battery. Repeat with the other wire on the other side of the battery. Alternatively, if you are using a battery snap, snap the end onto the end of a 9-volt battery or the battery pack. Use caution while building your circuit. Although unlikely, it is possible to get a very small shock if you touch the wire directly while attached to the battery.
