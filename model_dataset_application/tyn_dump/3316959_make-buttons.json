Cut the circle out with fabric scissors. If you need to make more covered buttons, trace and cut more circles. Depending on how thin your fabric is, you may be able to cut several circles out at once by folding the fabric a few times. Place the fabric center into the bottom part of the tool. Find the rubbery, cup-shaped piece in your button cover kit. Set it down on a flat surface with the cupped part facing up. Place the fabric circle on top of it, right-side-down. Press the button cover into the rubber cup, right over the fabric. Find one of the dome-shaped metal pieces in your kit. Place it rounded-side-down into the rubber cup until it hits the bottom.

Some types of resin turn opaque after they cure. Others turn a different color. Prepare your work surface. Resin sets quickly, so have everything laid out and ready to go. Choose an area with adequate ventilation. Next, cover your work surface with newspaper or a cheap tablecloth. Put on a pair of gloves. Set out you stir sticks, button mold, and any additives. This includes things like resin dyes, glitter, and confetti. High-humidity levels can sometimes affect curing times or cause resin to cure improperly. Plan on making your buttons on a dry day. Mix your resin according to the package. Most resins come in two parts, and need to be mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Some resins are different however, so be sure that you read the mixing instructions carefully. If you don't use the correct amounts, the resin may not cure properly. Typically, however, you will need to pour Part A and Part B into separate mixing cups, then pour Part A into Part B, then stir it together with a stick\nIf you wish to dye the resin, do so during this step. Follow the instructions on the dye package, as each brand may be different. If you plan on making a lot of buttons, consider mixing only small amounts of resin at a time. Resin sets quickly, and it may harden before you finish filling all of the molds. Pour the resin into the mold. Hold the cup close to the mold, and pour the resin in slowly. This will help prevent splatters and air bubbles. Do not overfill the mold. If you do, you will end up covering the button holes. If there are any air bubbles, gently blow on the resin. Consider adding some glitter or confetti into the resin after you pour it into the mold. If you need to, use a toothpick to stir the glitter or confetti around. Wait for the resin to cure. Leave the buttons undisturbed during this time. How long the resin takes to cure depends on the type of resin you are using. Some take only a few minutes to cure while others take a few hours. Read the label to specific curing times. Just because the resin is hard does not necessarily mean that it is cured and ready to go. Follow the curing times exactly. Pop the resin button out of the mold. Once the curing time is up, you button is ready to go! Turn the mold upside down, and gently pop the button out.",

    "Making Wooden Buttons Get a thick branch.",

    "If you want a simpler button, choose a wooden dowel instead.",
    "Cut off jagged the ends of the branch.",

    "The scrap piece of wood is there to protect your work surface.",
    "Wear safety glasses and gloves for this step.",
    "If you need to, flip the button over, and drill the holes through the other side.",
    "This will help make them more even.",
    "Buff the front and back of each button with a piece of sandpaper.",
    "This will help soften the edges around the button and the button holes, and prevent snagging.",
    "Paint or decorate the buttons, if desired.",
