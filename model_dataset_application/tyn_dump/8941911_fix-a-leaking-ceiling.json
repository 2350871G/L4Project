If water accumulates over your ceiling the water can weigh down your ceiling and create a large hole or cause it to collapse. If you create a larger hole, you may be able to see where the leak is coming from more easily."

Common sources of ceiling leaks include faulty pipes or cracks in your roof. Once you drain the leak, it's important to call a professional roof specialist or handyman who can fix the source of the leak. Taking care of the leak quickly will reduce the cost of your repairs and could prevent future damage. Another cause of leaks is faulty air conditioning. Your air conditioner's condensate lines could be clogged, leading to overflow that can cause ceiling leaks."
