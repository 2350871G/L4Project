          "description":"If you have a wooden-framed window, pry off the frame and sash using a pry bar. Then take a reciprocating saw and cut between the wall studs and the frame. If you have a metal window frame that's rusted, determine if it was screwed or riveted in place. Unscrew it if you can or use a drill to remove the rivets. Then pull away the metal frame from the surrounding concrete. The wooden frame is also called a jamb while a metal frame is also called a buck. If the metal frame isn't rusted, you can typically leave it in place and replace just the window pieces."

          "description":"For a wooden window frame, measure the width and height of the frame. Use the inside measurements instead of the outside measurements since some window sills are sloped. If you're measuring a metal window frame, measure the height and width. If you didn't take the frame out, you can simply measure the size of the window. If you can't get an exact size, order a slightly smaller window that you can fill in with mortar."

If you have a concrete or brick opening, check for ridges that will make it difficult to install the new window. To remove concrete ridges, use a hammer and cold chisel to chip away the excess mortar. If you don't want to chip away mortar ridges, consider buying a window that's smaller and won't need to be installed over the ridge."

Use galvanized or stainless steel screws to screw the window in place. If you're screwing the window into concrete, you'll have to screw double-threaded concrete screws using a hammer drill. Check to see if your replacement window came with screw cover plugs and put them on if so."

Once you know the size you want your window to be, take a sketch of it to your city's building inspector's office to get a building permit. The bottom of the window can't be more than 44 in (1.1 m) from the floor. This ensures that the window is easy to use as an emergency entrance or exit."

Pay attention to any obstacles you might face when installing the window. Once you're satisfied with where to place the window, outline the window measurements on the wall using masking tape. Make the outline 3 1/2 in (8 cm) wider and 1 3/4 in (4 cm) higher to account for the wooden frame.
