  "text":" Preparing the Base Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, instant coffee, and milk. Separate the eggs first, and place the yolks into a mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar, instant coffee, and milk. Beat everything together with a whisk. Save yourself some cleaning and use a microwave-safe bowl. Avoid glass. Discard the whites or save them for another recipe, such as meringues or macarons. Microwave the mixture on high for 3 to 4 minutes. After about 1\u00bd o 2 minutes, pause the microwave, and give the mixture a stir. The mixture is ready when it thickens slightly and the sugar dissolves. Cool the mixture in ice water for 15 minutes. Plug a sink and place the bowl inside. Add lots of ice, and start filling the sink with cold water. Stop when the water is level with the mixture inside the bowl. Let the mixture cool in the ice bath for 15 minutes. Do not use a glass bowl for this. If you used a glass bowl previously, pour the mixture into a ceramic or stainless steel bowl first. While the mixture cools, save time by preparing the coffee sauce and frosting. Beat the cream cheese until it is light and fluffy. You can do this in an electric mixer or in a food processor fitted with whisks. For a more traditional tiramisu, use mascarpone cheese instead. Slowly beat in the cooled egg mixture. Pour in half of the egg mixture into the cream cheese. Mix it in well, then repeat with the remaining egg mixture. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl using a rubber spatula. This helps everything mix more evenly. Beat the heavy whipping cream until it forms stiff peaks. Pour 1 cup (240 milliliters) of heavy cream into a mixer or food processor fitted with whisks. Beat it until it forms stiff peaks. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Use a rubber spatula to scoop the whipped cream into the beaten cream cheese. Gently fold it in, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl often. Preparing the Sauce and Frosting Start preparing the coffee sauce in a small bowl. Pour the hot water into a small mixing bowl. Stir in 2 teaspoons of instant coffee. For something more traditional, you could use cold espresso instead. Add some flavor with liqueur and vanilla extract. Pour in the coffee liqueur and \u00bd teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir everything together until combined. If you don't like the flavor of liqueur, you can replace the liqueur with water. Set the coffee sauce aside. You will be brushing this onto the ladyfinger layers in the cake. This will help give the cake flavor and moisture. Start mixing the coffee whipped cream. Pour \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of heavy whipping cream into a small mixing bowl. Add in the confectioners sugar, 1 teaspoon of instant coffee, and \u00bc teaspoon of vanilla extract. Beat the coffee whipped cream until it forms stiff peaks. You can do this in an electric mixer or in a food processor fitted with whisks. Keep mixing until the color is uniform and the texture is stiff. From time to time, pause the mixer or processor, and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Set the coffee whipped cream aside. You will be adding this layer last, so it might be a good idea to keep it in the fridge. Assembling the Cake Cut the ladyfingers in half. Use a sharp knife to split the ladyfingers fingers in half lengthwise. If you are having trouble doing this, you can use whole lady fingers instead; your tiramisu will simply be more cake-y. Line a dish with the ladyfingers. Choose a 2\u00bd to 3-quart (2\u00bd to 3-liter) baking dish or souffl\u00e9 dish. Line the bottom of the dish with the lady fingers, cut-side-up. You can also try lining the sides as well with more ladyfingers. Save any remaining ladyfingers for later. Don't try to cram them all into the dish. Coat the ladyfingers with the coffee sauce. Use a pastry brush to coat the ladyfingers with about 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of the coffee sauce. Alternatively, you can dip each ladyfinger into the coffee sauce for 1 to 2 seconds, then place them back into the dish. Spread half of the filling over the ladyfingers. Use a rubber spatula to scoop the cream cheese filling onto the ladyfingers. Gently smooth the layer flat with the rubber spatula, making sure that there are no gaps. Repeat the ladyfinger, coffee sauce, and filling layer. Add more ladyfingers on top of the filling. Brush them with more coffee sauce, then spread on the rest of the cream cheese filling. Finish off with a final layer of lady fingers and coffee sauce. Press the remaining ladyfingers on top. This time, press them cut-side down. Cover the ladyfingers with the coffee whipped cream. Scoop the whipped cream on top of the ladyfingers in small mounds. Use a rubber spatula to gently blend the mounts together, forming a thick, even layer. Cover and chill the tiramisu for 2 hours. Cover the tiramisu with a sheet of plastic wrap. Place it in the fridge. Let it chill until it firms up. This will take about 2 hours. Serve the tiramisu. Once the tiramisu is firm, pull off the plastic wrap. For a more traditional touch, sprinkle it with cocoa powder.",
