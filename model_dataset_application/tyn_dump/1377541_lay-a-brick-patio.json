          "description":"After you have determined the size, you must consider a few things like the pattern used to place the pavers (the bricks) and the material that will be used as a border. Here are a few points to consider. There are a number of designs you can follow for the pavers. Some of the best know are the \"basket weave,\" the \"jack on jack,\" and the \"herringbone.\" The basket weave or \"pinwheel\" design involves sets of eight total bricks laid in groups of two, with each pair set together left to right adjoining another pair set at an angle perpendicular to them. The \"jack on jack\" pattern is a uniform set columns and rows, with each paver set end-to-end and side by side. The herringbone design is a pattern involving pavers abutting to create a ninety degree angle, with the end of one paver used to cover the end of another. The pattern you select will have a very real impact on the amount of time and energy needed to complete this project. For example, certain paver pattern designs will require you to precisely cut half of the pavers as you reach the edges of your patio, or you will have to purchase specially sized pavers with this in mind. You must also determine if you want a border made of pavers or of wood. Lumber can provide a nice contrast to the pavers, and it is comparatively quick and easy to install. Pavers will take quite a lot more time to install but will seamlessly match the rest of your patio. Pavers made of light aluminum, plastic, or light gauge steel can be anchored down with 10-inch spikes. This kind of edging are great for curves and angles."

          "description":"Use your estimate of the size and your thoughts regarding the design of the patio to determine the quantity of the pavers you will need. Of course, there are some additional supplies that will be necessary in order for you to finish this project. A full list of supplies will be provided at the end of this guide, but some in particular are listed here as well. Crushed stone or gravel (typically a \u00be minus road base material) may be used to fill the deepest portions of the excavation floor after you have dug out the area for the patio, providing stability and aiding drainage. You can determine the quantity yourself, but you should use at least 4 inches (10 cm) of crushed stone as the base layer. Calculate the necessary volume of crushed stone or gravel before you head to the home or garden shop. Bedding sand will make up the layer just below the bricks and can be used to fill the gaps between them. Polymeric joint sand can be swept into brick joints to help lock them into place. If you don't use crushed stone or gravel, this will also be the foundation of your patio. Some suggest that a layer just one inch deep is adequate, but other suggest at least twice that amount. You will need to know the volume of sand necessary when you make your purchase. You may want to lay landscape fabric underneath to discourage the growth of weeds. It would require a lot of effort to remove weeds growing through your patio, so it is probably best to stop it before it starts. If you will use lumber along the edges of your patio as support, determine the quality and quantity of pressure-treated lumber you will require. There are a number of varieties available, but for a job like this you will want one rated for ground contact."
