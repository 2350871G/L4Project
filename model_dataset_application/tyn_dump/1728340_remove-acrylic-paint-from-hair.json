Apply a liberal amount of shampoo to your hair and massage gently. No special shampoo is required \u2013 you can just use your normal product. Let the shampoo sit for about 10-20 minutes before washing off. Run a fine-toothed comb gently through your hair. Try to comb out the sections of paint that have now softened.
