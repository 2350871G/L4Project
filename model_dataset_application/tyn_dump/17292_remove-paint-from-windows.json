    "The respirator goes over your mouth and nose and lets you breathe in clean air even while there are lots of dust, fumes, and paint chips flying around.",
    "Empty a solvent-based paint stripper into a clean bucket.",
    "Solvent-based strippers are great for this type of work because they break down the bond that is holding the paint to the wood, making it a lot easier to scrape away.",
    "Use a clean bucket that is big enough to safely hold the solvent without it spilling over.",
    "Visit your local home improvement store to buy a solvent-based paint stripper.Warning: Always read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions before you begin using this kind of product.",
    "Some brands may have different instructions about timing or application that you will need to follow.",
    "Dip a paintbrush into the stripper and paint a small section of the window.",
    "Use a clean, inexpensive paintbrush that you can buy at a hardware or home improvement store.",
    "Start with working on just one side of the window frame, rather than trying to paint the entire thing all at once.",
    "This will expose you to fewer fumes and you can take a break while the stripper is saturating the paint.",
    "Layer the solvent on as thickly as you can without it running down the wood.",
    "Let the stripper saturate the wood for about 20 minutes.",
    "This time might differ depending on what the manufacturer\u2019s instructions specify.",
    "Keep an eye out for signs that the stripper is working:\nThe paint will start to bubble\nThe surface of the paint will look uneven\nSections of paint may even start to come away from the frame Use a scraper to remove as much of the treated paint as you can.",
    "After the designated amount of time has passed, go ahead and start scraping away at the paint.",
    "Use gentle motions and try your best not to knick or gouge the wood underneath.",
    "If you can get a small section of the paint lifted, it usually will come off in a long strip.",
    "If there are multiple layers of paint to be removed, you may need to repeat the painting and scraping process several times until you get down to the bare wood.Working with Lead Paint: Lead paint is most commonly found in homes built prior to 1978.",
    "Make sure you cover any carpet with a taped-down tarp so the dust from the paint doesn\u2019t get into it.",
    "Use a respirator, goggles, and shoe covers, and use a shop vac to thoroughly clean up the removed paint and dust from the floor and window sill.",
    "Opt for a wire brush to scrape paint away from creases and depressions.",
    "If there are smaller moldings in the window frame that aren\u2019t easily accessed with a paint scraper, use a wire brush instead.",
    "It\u2019ll allow you to get to those thin sections and clean them out.",
    "As with the scraper, use gentle motions and avoid gouging the wood with the wire brush.",
    "Repeat the stripper and scraper steps until the frame has been treated.",
    "This project may take you a few days, just depending on how much time you have to devote to it each day, but it\u2019ll get done sooner than you think!",
    "Focus on doing one entire window at a time before moving on to the next one.",
    "Wipe down the wood with a clean, wet rag.",
    "Once the entire frame has been treated and scraped, wet a clean rag in water.",
    "Wipe down the frame and windowsill, and don\u2019t forget to get in all the cracks and crevices, too.",
    "If there are lots of chips of paint, use a shop vac to clean them up first.",
    "Sand the window pane to create a smooth surface.",
    "Use a manual sander with 220-grit sandpaper to work away any small scrapes and remove any tiny flecks of paint that remain.",
    "Once that is done, you can move on to refinishing the window pane however you\u2019d like.",
    "Wipe down the frame again after sanding to clear away any dust that remains.",
    "Treating Metal Windows Lay down a tarp and put on your protective gear.",
    "Use a tarp or a drop cloth to cover the ground beneath the window to protect the floor from the paint stripper.",
    "Put on rubber gloves, goggles, and a respirator before you start working.",
    "If you can, open some windows or run a fan to help keep the room as well-ventilated as possible while you work.Tip: Wear long sleeves and pants to protect your skin from spills and drips.",
    "Pour the stripper into a glass or metal bucket so it\u2019s easier to access.",
    "Choose a stripper that is made specifically for metal and read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions before you begin using it.",
    "Some products will have longer curing times than others, which might affect your decision.",
    "Never use a plastic or styrofoam container for the stripper, as it could actually eat through the material and leak all over your floor.",
    "Apply the paint stripper to the metal window frame and let it sit.",
    "Use a disposable paint brush so that you can just discard it once you\u2019re done working.",
    "Apply as thick of a coat of the stripper as you can without having it drip down the frame.",
    "Leave the stripper alone to do its work, which usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "As the stripper starts to work, the paint will start to bubble up and peel off of the metal frame.",
    "Scrape away as much of the paint as possible.",
    "Use a paint scraper or a nylon brush or scrubbing pad to chip away the peeling paint.",
    "If there is more dried paint underneath the first layer, reapply the stripper and repeat the scraping process as many times as needed until the metal is exposed.",
    "For hard to reach crevices, use a wire brush.",
    "Use mineral spirits to wipe down the window frame.",
    "Mineral spirits are often used as a paint thinner, so it\u2019s a great product to use to remove any remaining bits and flecks of paint.",
    "Simply dampen a clean rag with the spirits and wipe down the frame from top to bottom.",
    "You can buy mineral spirits at your local home improvement store.",
    "Rinse the window frame and then dry it off with a clean rag.",
    "Dip a clean rag into water and thoroughly wipe down the window frame to remove any remnants of paint thinner or mineral spirits.",
    "After that, take a clean, dry rag and dry off the frame completely.",
    "Once that is done, you\u2019re ready to repaint or refinish your metal window frame however you please!"
