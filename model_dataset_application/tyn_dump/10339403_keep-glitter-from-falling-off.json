Make sure the entire area is coated and that there are no bare spots. You can even make your own Mod Podge at home to save money! If you don\u2019t have Mod Podge, you could also use regular white school glue, though school glue often chips off easily over time.

You can also use a foam brush to spread on your glitter if you want a little more control over how much you use. If you are looking for a high-glitter outcome, you can apply a second layer of Mod Podge and glitter immediately after the first one without waiting for it to dry first (it will take a little longer to dry after the second coat, then, but it will be highly glitterized)."
