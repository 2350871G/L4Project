For glass tiles, use nippers that have carbide wheels attached to the ends\u2013 these allow you to apply enough pressure to cut the glass without cracking or damaging it. Use nippers on glass tiles \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) thick. Anything thicker may be too difficult to cut through. Nippers can be purchased from home improvement stores or online for around $15."

Scoring and snapping allows you to cut larger squares of tile into smaller squares and isn\u2019t ideal for cutting irregular shapes or patterns.

Wet saws allow you to cut squares out of larger pieces of tile quickly and evenly, but isn\u2019t great for cutting curved or irregular shapes.

    "Position the scored glass tile so the edge of the tile that you want to snap off is hanging over the edge of the table or workbench.",
    "This will give you room to snap the piece off.",
    "In one swift motion, snap the glass downwards using the pliers to grip it.",
    "The glass should break cleanly along the line you scored.",
    "Don\u2019t press down slowly or the edge of the glass may break off unevenly.",
    "Wipe away the marker and use a rubbing stone to smooth the edges tile.",
    "Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away the washable marker.",
    "The glass tile piece will be sharp and possibly a little rough, so take a rubbing stone, hold it at a 45 degree angle to the front of the tile, and rub it in a parallel motion over the edge to round and smooth it out.",
    "Rub the rubbing stone down the whole length of the edge.",
    "A rubbing stone can also be used to buff out any small irregularities in the break.",
    "Using a Wet Saw Choose a wet saw if you need to cut larger or thicker pieces of tile.",
    "Large tiles can be difficult to score deep enough to be snapped or nipped, but a wet saw can effectively cut through the thickest glass tile.",
    "Wet saws release a steady stream of water as the blade cuts to decrease friction and are more time-effective and have less of a chance of damaging glass tiles.",
    "Wet saws allow you to cut squares out of larger pieces of tile quickly and evenly, but isn\u2019t great for cutting curved or irregular shapes.",
    "You can rent wet saws from home improvement stores like Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s for about $50 a day.",
    "Use a glass tile blade on the wet saw to cut your tile.",
    "A glass diamond blade will create a smoother cut in the tile and ensure an even edge.",
    "Glass tile blades have a finer and softer blade, which means it will take longer to pass through the saw, but will result in a better edge on the glass tile pieces you cut.",
    "Use a straightedge and washable marker to draw cutting guidelines.",
    "Washable markers are easy to clean up later, but will still draw clear lines for you to follow with your wet saw.",
    "Use a straight edge as a guide and form straight lines with your marker where you want to cut the glass tile.",
    "Make sure the lines are straight and even.",
    "You can always just wipe the marker away and form the lines again.",
    "Put on rubber gloves for extra grip.",
    "Because the wet saw uses water to reduce friction and cool the blade, the glass tile could become slippery to hold with your hands.",
    "Use a pair of rubber gloves to increase your grip on the glass.",
    "Don\u2019t use leather or fabric gloves because they\u2019ll become soaked in water.",
    "Latex gloves work fine, too.",
    "Turn on the saw and let it run for 15 seconds.",
    "Give the saw a chance to warm up and get going by turning it on and allowing the water to flow freely over the blade of the saw.",
    "Wait about 15 seconds before you begin cutting so you can be sure the saw is functioning properly and the water is flowing smoothly.Warning: If the water isn\u2019t flowing, don\u2019t cut with the saw!",
    "The friction could cause the glass to shatter and the blade could heat up and damage the saw.",
    "Line up the cutting guide on the wet saw and the guidelines on the tile.",
    "The wet saw will have measuring or cutting guides that will lock the glass tile in place.",
    "Use the guide on the wet saw and match it up to the lines you drew on the tile with the washable marker, then slide the guide to lock the tile and keep it from moving.",
    "Align the saw carefully, because you won't be able to undo a cut once you make it!",
    "Push the tile through the saw and away from you.",
    "Feed the tile slowly through the saw with a light but consistent pressure as the blade cuts through it.",
    "Push with your hands on the edge of the glass away from the blade, keeping your movement continuous.",
    "Push the tile through the saw until it cuts all the way through for an even cut and a smoother edge.",
    "Turn off the saw and wipe away the washable marker.",
    "When you have finished cutting your glass tile, use a clean cloth to wipe away the washable marker guidelines.",
    "Power down the saw and wait for the blade to stop spinning completely before you pick up or handle the saw.",
    "Wipe up and dust or glass pieces that may be on your saw or workstation.",
    "Smooth the edges of the cut tile glass with a rubbing stone.",
    "The wet saw produces clean and even lines, but it\u2019s still a good idea to smooth the edges of the tile so they are less likely to cut you.",
    "Hold the stone at 45 degree angle on the front of the tile and run it over the edge to round it out.",
    "Smooth the entire edge of the glass tile."
