To fully cook the noodles, allow them to soak for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring them gently every 1 to 2 minutes to help loosen them. The noodles are done when they are completely limp. Thin, thread-like noodles may cook in less than 7 minutes, while flat rice noodles may take more than 10 minutes if they are thick. Remove the noodles sooner if you plan on cooking them in another dish. The noodles should be pulled out once they just begin to separate if you plan on cooking them further in other hot dishes. This will only take a few minutes. To create a chewier noodle, pre-soak the noodles in lukewarm water before cooking them in boiling water. Soak the noodles in lukewarm water until they are just barely pliable. Drain, then finish cooking in boiling water for an additional 2 minutes or until the center is chewy but not hard."
