After sewing this line, trim the edge so that there is only 1/8 inch (3 mm) between the thread line and the raw edge. This stitch will end up being on the bottom of your hem. It should help you maintain an even, consistent roll."

          "description":"Fold the raw edge toward the wrong side of the fabric and press in place using an iron. While not entirely necessary, pressing the fold in place will make the hem less likely to unroll as you stitch. Fold the fabric so that the bend falls just past your initial row of stitching. You should see your initial stitching along the underside of the fabric but not from the front."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick up a few threads with your sewing needle.",
          "description":"Pick up one thread from the fabric and a small stitch from the edge of your fold. Pull the needle through, but do not pull it taut just yet. Use a small, sharp needle for best results. Doing so will make it easier to pick up single threads along your hem. The stitch made into your fold should be as close to the actual fold as possible. Position it in between your initial line of stitching and the fold itself. The threads you pick up from the front of the actual fabric should be directly above the stitch made into your fold. These threads should also be right above the raw edge. Make sure that you only pick up one or two threads from the fabric. Picking up more will cause the hem to be more visible from the front of the fabric."

As you get better at the process, you can pull the thread after 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of stitching rather than every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). If completed correctly, the raw edge should be hidden along the wrong side of the fabric and the hem stitching should be barely visible from the front."

Use sharp scissors to trim back the raw edge as close to the new sewing line you just created in the previous step. Make sure that you do not cut beneath or into the stitches as you complete this step. Fold over the hemline. Turn the material in toward the wrong side again, just enough to fold the raw edge under. Press this fold in place with an iron. The second line of stitching you made should be folded in during this step. Your initial line of stitching will still be visible.
