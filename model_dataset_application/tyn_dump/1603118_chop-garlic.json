  "text":" Separating and Peeling Garlic Cloves Pull a clove away from the head of garlic. You may need to peel back some of the papery covering that protects the head of garlic. Then, use your thumb to tug a single clove away from the center of the head. Lay it flat-side down on a cutting board. The head of garlic is also called a bulb. The clove is a single part of the head or bulb. Push the flat side of a knife on the clove to loosen the peel. Take a chef's knife and lay it on the clove so the flat side is resting on top of it.
