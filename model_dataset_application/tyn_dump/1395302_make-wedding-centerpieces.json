Purchase cut flowers from a florist with good quality flowers and lots of variety. If you are going to use a mixed variety of flowers for the arrange, collect five varieties of leaves or shapes. If you are going for a more simple arrangement, look for perhaps one star flower and one complementing flower with a different leaf shape. Ask your wedding planner to recommend a florist or call around and compare prices for wedding arrangements from several florists. There are also online sites where you can order floral arrangements in bulk, a great option if you are creating centerpieces for a large wedding. If you decide to use silk flowers instead of fresh ones, order silk flowers online in bulk and create your own silk flower arrangements. You may want to also consider using succulents or tropical plants to create a unique look for the centerpieces."

    "Ask your wedding planner to recommend a florist or call around and compare prices for wedding arrangements from several florists.",
    "There are also online sites where you can order floral arrangements in bulk, a great option if you are creating centerpieces for a large wedding.",

    "Prepare the centerpieces one day prior to the wedding day.",

    "If you are using decorative leaves in the arrangement, place these in the container first to act as a nice base for the arrangement.",
    "Place the star flowers into the container.",
    "Use three stems of the star flower and place them in the three sections of the container.",

    "You may prefer simple glass holders or you may be looking for something a bit more bold like sleek tapers or twisted metal holders.",
    "Consider which holders best complement the candles you have chosen, as well as the overall look of the wedding.",
