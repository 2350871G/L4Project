    "Preventing Future Growth Reduce humidity levels.",
    "Keep the humidity level in your home between 30 and 50 percent.",
    "Open the windows on days when it's not humid.",
    "This will allow fresh air to circulate and inhibit mold growth.",
    "If you live in a humid climate, run a dehumidifier in the rooms most prone to moisture.",
    "Remove carpeting from the basement and bathroom.",
    "These areas are already prone to humidity.",
    "Carpets can trap moisture under their surface, even without flooding or water seepage.",
    "If your basement or bathroom isn't carpeted, leave the floors bare.",
    "Use removable, washable mats to avoid slip hazards.",
    "Install a sump pump.",
    "This is a great investment if you live in a flood-prone area.",
    "Water that seeps into the basement collects in a sump basin and is pumped outside.",
    "Unless you are a licensed home improvement contractor, call a professional to install one.",
    "Choose a sump pump with the following specs:\nCast iron core\nAlarm that sounds when the water level gets too high\nMechanical switch\nSubmersible pump\nNo-screen intake design\nImpeller that can deal with objects of 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter.",
    "Run exhaust fans.",
    "When you cook, turn on the exhaust fan over the stove to catch water vapor.",
    "Use the fan in the bathroom as you shower to reduce condensation cause by steam.",
    "Even if you take cooler showers, run the exhaust fan for good measure.",
    "Let the fans in each room run until all steam has been eliminated.",
    "Use dehumidifiers.",
    "Install them in the basement and in closets.",
    "Clean each dehumidifier regularly.",
    "Follow the manufacturer's instructions closely for best results.",
    "Wipe down the shower curtain.",
    "Use a clean dry towel or a squeegee to remove any leftover water droplets.",
    "Make sure the curtain is completely dry.",
    "Do this after the last shower of the day to prevent moisture buildup.",
    "Prevent water from pooling.",
    "Water can pond around the foundation of your house and push moisture into the interior.",
    "Landscape the area around the foundation to slope downward and away from the foundation.",
    "Add extensions to downspouts to direct rainwater at least 5 feet (1.5 m) away from the foundation.",
    "Use the right insulation.",
    "Apply spray-on Icynene foam to the ceiling of your attic.",
    "The foam forms a water-tight seal as it dries.",
    "Avoid fiberglass and hard foam insulation.",
    "They can separate from their surfaces and allow moisture to seep in.",
    "Wet spray-applied cellulose insulation is also prone to mold.",
    "Inspect your home regularly.",
    "Check all problem areas or potential problem areas for mold (re)growth.",
    "Monitor all sealed leaks and cracks after heavy rains or floods.",
    "Otherwise, recheck your home thoroughly every six months."
