If you find any, hold a heat gun 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) away from the spot and wave it back and forth for 20-30 seconds. The hot air will cause the sticky fluid to harden rapidly, allowing it to be sanded away with ease. A hair dryer set to the highest heat setting may also help dry up flowing resin if you don\u2019t have a heat gun handy. You have the best chance of encountering oozing knots in pieces of wood that have been cut within a matter of days."

          "description":"If you\u2019ve got a knot bleeding through a surface that\u2019s already been finished, start by sanding the discolored spot with a sheet of 120-grit sandpaper until the knot itself is visible. Scuffing up the existing paint or stain will create a grippier base surface, helping your filler materials stick and set up better. While you\u2019re at it, be sure to remove any loose wood chunks or splinters you find in the area surrounding the knot. A pair of tweezers can come in handy for this. Simply slapping an extra layer of paint or stain onto a bleeding pine knot won\u2019t cut it. The natural oils and resins in softwoods are so potent and persistent that they can leach through multiple coats of finish."

          "description":"Most epoxies just need a good stir and they\u2019re ready to go. Others may require you to mix multiple components, such as a resin and a hardener. Always follow the specific instructions listed on the packaging of the product you\u2019re working with. You can pick up a container of epoxy from any hardware store or home improvement center for around $3-5. Make sure the epoxy you buy is specifically formulated for use on wood surfaces."

          "description":"If your epoxy came in a tube, simply squeeze it into the knot until the thick fluid is level with the top. If you got the kind that you have to mix yourself, scoop a small amount into the knot with the tip of a putty knife or hand trowel, then use the flat part of the blade to smooth it until it's fat. Wipe off any epoxy that finds its way onto the wood around the knot using an old rag saturated with acetone. If you don\u2019t own a putty knife or trowel, a wooden paint stirrer stick or tongue depressor can make an acceptable substitute. Some epoxies come with their own applicator tools, which generally work well for applying and smoothing the product."

          "headline":"Allow the epoxy to cure for 24-48 hours.",
          "description":"The built-up finish needs to have a chance to dry and harden before you can paint or stain it. This could take anywhere from 60 minutes to  hours, depending on the exact type and amount of the product you\u2019re using. However, it\u2019s best to let the filler sit for a few days to make sure that it\u2019s hard enough to prevent accidental damage during the next phase of your project. Check the specifications on the label of the product you\u2019re using for more information on drying times and other guidelines that you may need to know. Keep in mind that the temperature and humidity of your work area could have an impact on how long it takes your epoxy to set up. Fluctuations in temperature and moisture tend to slow down the curing process.Tip: Use a heat lamp, heat gun, space heater, or similar tool to accelerate the curing process. Most epoxies reach their full hardness faster when exposed to mild, continuous heat."

          "description":"Once the filled knot has time to cure completely, go over it with your sander to blend the spot into the surrounding wood. Use fluid, circular motions to buff the new finish to a uniform height without leaving scratches or grooves in the soft pine. After sanding, wipe the surface with a damp cloth to clear away dust, then wait for it to dry before moving on. Progressing from a medium-grit sandpaper to a high-grit sandpaper (somewhere in the range of 120-grit to 400-grit) tends to provide the best results for delicate wood finishing tasks."
