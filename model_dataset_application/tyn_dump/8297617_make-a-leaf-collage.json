          "description":"Before you go out looking for leaves, ask yourself what type of collage you'd like to make. Do you just want to make something pretty? Or do you want to make it informative? Decide between making an art project or a science project so you know what leaves to look for, how many you'll need, and whether you want to include stems or just the leaves themselves. For a science project, you could try to collect a leaf from every type of tree that grows in your area. Or you can try to find find leaves from different individual trees of the same type to show the difference between the size of a sapling's leaves versus a full grown tree's. For an art project, you can a landscape with leaves standing in for trees, with the leaf's stem standing in for a trunk. You could also make a wreath with lots of layers and differently colored leaves. For a landscape, you only need a few. For a wreath, the more the better! To identify specific types of leaves, there are plenty of field guides you could use, as well as websites like https://www.arborday.org/trees/whattree/."

          "description":"Take a stroll outside. If you live in a woodsy environment with lots of trees right outside your door, great! If not, visit a local park or any buildings with landscaping or potted trees outside. Look for whole leaves without any tears, holes, or diseased spots. You want to keep your leaves as pristine as possible, so don\u2019t stuff them in your pockets or a bag. Bring a manila folder, notebook, or something similar to slide them inside without folding them over. If it\u2019s spring or summer, search the trees and pluck the leaves directly from their stems. If it\u2019s autumn, search the ground, too, but avoid damp leaves if possible, since these may smell a little funky and start decaying faster than dry leaves."

But if you\u2019d like your leaves to be flat as possible so they make full contact with the paper that you\u2019ll be sticking them to, wait a couple days before making your collage. In the meantime, once you bring your leaves home, do the following:\nLay your leaves as flat as possible inside a manila folder or between sheets of paper that you don\u2019t mind getting a little damp or dirty, like old newspapers.

If you want a flat collage, dry the leaves between two paper towels in the pages of a super heavy book. Put a heavy object on top and leave it. When the leaves are dry, use a water-based glue like Mod Podge to arrange and secure the leaves.\u201d"

    "Keep a little distance between the glue and the leaf\u2019s edges.",
    "This way the glue won\u2019t squirt out from underneath when you stick it to the paper.",
    "A glue stick can be a neater alternative, since it\u2019s transparent and won\u2019t goop up anywhere.",
    "Rub it onto the back of the leaf, the paper itself, or both, and then press the two together.",
    "Add some finishing touches.",
    "This isn\u2019t a must, so if you\u2019re happy with your collage as it is, feel free to call it day!",
    "But there\u2019s plenty you could do to spruce your collage up even more.",
    "For instance:\nIf you\u2019ve grouped your leaves together by type, consider labeling.",
    "You can use pens or markers to write the type of tree directly on the backing paper where there\u2019s room.",
    "Or you can glue separate labels written on a different colored paper so they\u2019ll stand out even more.",
    "If you\u2019ve made a landscape, you can still draw in features like grass, clouds, or the sun or moon where space allows.",
    "You can even glue other materials to the backing paper for these, like green yarn for grass or cotton balls for clouds.",
    "You could also apply spray-on glue to the whole thing once you\u2019re finished.",
    "This will help preserve the leaves\u2019 original shapes and colors.",
    "Glitter, stickers, and similar materials can also be added to make your collage even more eye-catching.",
    "Using Contact Paper Decide how to use it.",
    "Contact paper comes in transparent sheets, each with a sticky adhesive side.",
    "This makes it a great protective cover for flat collages, plus it can also be used instead of glue!",
    "You can either use it to:\nSeal a finished glued collage.",
    "Stick leaves and other materials directly to it.",
    "Create a collage that\u2019s totally transparent except for the leaves.",
    "Seal glued collages.",
    "Give your glue time to dry once you\u2019re finished attaching everything to the backing paper.",
    "In the meantime, use scissors to trim your contact paper to match the backing paper\u2019s size.",
    "Once the glued materials feel firmly in place, remove the backing to the contact paper\u2019s sticky side.",
    "Lay the contact paper facedown, with the sticky side up.",
    "Then line up your backing paper with its edges and press the two together, with your leaves sandwiched in between.",
    "This is only a good idea for flat collages.",
    "If you\u2019re using stuff like cotton balls and yarns, or if you like the way your leaves curl, this would only flatten them out and ruin the effect.",
    "Use contact paper instead of glue.",
    "First, lay out your backing paper and decide on your design.",
    "Because contact paper is so sticky, correcting mistakes will be even more difficult than with glue, so definitely take the time to figure out how you want to arrange your leaves before you begin.",
    "You\u2019re also going to use the contact paper\u2019s sticky side to fix your backing paper in place, so leave the edges clear so the two connect.",
    "Once you\u2019re satisfied:\nPeel off the backing to the contact paper\u2019s sticky side and lay the paper down with the sticky side facing up.",
    "Take a leaf from your backing paper and press it facedown into the contact paper\u2019s sticky side.",
    "Because the contact paper is facedown, remember that sides are reversed.",
    "For example, if your backing paper and contact paper are side-by-side, the leaf that\u2019s lying faceup all the way to the right of your backing paper should be placed facedown all the way to the left of your contact paper.",
    "Continue sticking leaves (and any other materials) one at a time so you don\u2019t lose track of which goes where.",
    "When you\u2019re finished, flip the backing paper over, line its edges up with the contact paper\u2019s, and press the two together.",
    "Make a transparent collage.",
    "Say you know exactly where you want to hang your collage, but instead of obscuring the wall with backing paper, you want your leaves to accent the wall itself.",
    "In that case, use two sheets of contact paper: one for the front, the other for the back, with the sticky sides facing each other.",
    "To do this:\nUse two sheets of contact paper of equal size, trimming one to match the other if needed.",
    "Arrange your leaves on any surface to settle on a design.",
    "Again, contact paper is pretty sticky, and removing your leaves once they\u2019re in place will be pretty tough.",
    "Remove the backing to one sheet of contact paper.",
    "Lay that sheet facedown, with the sticky side up.",
    "Stick the back of each leaf, one by one, to the contact paper, following your design exactly.",
    "Once you\u2019re all done, remove the backing to the other sheet of contact paper.",
    "Line their edges up and press the two together, with the leaves sandwiched between the two sticky sides."
