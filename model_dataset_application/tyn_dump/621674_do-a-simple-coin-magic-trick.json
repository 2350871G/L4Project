The Disappearing Elbow Trick Set the trick up for your audience. Tell them that you can make a quarter change color by rubbing it hard enough on your elbow.

    "For the cloth, you can use a piece of paper, a rag, or a paper towel.",
    "It doesn't have to be a penny, but the penny is a good, average size.",
    "The smaller the piece of tape, the better (it'll be less obvious should you not be skilled in sleight of hand) \u2013 however, you risk the penny not sticking to it when the trick is in full gear.",
    "Take your cloth and show it to the audience.",
    "Keep the double-sided tape bit concealed and facing you.",
    "For all your audience knows, it's just a regular paper towel (or whatever it is you're using).",
    "Be careful putting your finger over the tape \u2013 you don't want to remove the adhesive from the tape with the oils from your fingers before the trick even begins.",
    "Stick the penny in the center of the cloth, tape side up.",
    "Show it to your audience.",
    "It's just a regular penny inside a paper towel, right?",
    "Right.",
    "Well, if you make sure your hand is blocking the piece of tape from view.",
    "The flimsier the cloth, the better.",
    "This way when you show the center of the cloth with the penny, the sides naturally fall down, away from view.",
    "Fold the corners in, starting with the taped corner.",
    "One by one, fold them all in.",
    "In this little pocket you've created, you're going to make the coin disappear.",
    "But first, ask a person in the audience to feel the coin is still there.",
    "It will be, arousing no suspicion.",
    "Keep the corners folded in as the person touches it.",
    "However, encourage them to touch it on both sides.",
    "As long as they don't move the cloth, your trick should go off without a hitch.",
    "Reveal the empty cloth by unfolding the corners, making sure your finger is on the penny.",
    "And then presto!",
    "Show the empty cloth, towel, or paper to your audience.",
    "Wiggle it around, holding it by the same taped corner.",
    "Where did it go?",
    "Remember: if someone asks you how you did it, just say, \"A magician never reveals his secrets!\""
