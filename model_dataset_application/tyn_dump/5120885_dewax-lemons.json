It's best to work with only a few lemons at a time so that they can move around freely in the bottom of the colander. If you pile the lemons together, less of the peel will be visible, making it more difficult for the hot water to come into contact with the wax."

It is important to use cold water. The boiling water heated the lemon peel, and the cold water quickly drops it back down to a more suitable temperature. Avoid using a brush or scrubbing sponge used for dishes. Soap residue inside the brush could get onto the fruit and contaminate the peel."

You could also allow the lemons to air dry on your kitchen counter instead of using paper towels. Only store dewaxed lemons after they have been thoroughly dry. Microwaving to Remove Wax Place the lemons on a microwave-safe plate. Arrange the lemons on a microwavable plate or in a microwavable dish. Keep them in an even, single layer. Work with only a few lemons at a time for best results. Do not stack the lemons on the plate. Stacking them can result in uneven heating, which may make it difficult to fully strip away the wax.
