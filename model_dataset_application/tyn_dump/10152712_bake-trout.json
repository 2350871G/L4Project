Cut each square so that it is 3 in (7.6 cm) longer than the fish on each side. Make sure you have enough squares of foil to wrap each piece of fish. If you don\u2019t have heavy duty aluminum foil, you can use 2 sheets of regular aluminum foil to wrap the fish."

Replace them with fresh sprigs of parsley and lemon slices, and sprinkle salt and pepper over the skin to taste. If you want extra flavor, pour the juices left in the foil packet over the flesh of the trout before adding the seasons. For leftover trout, seal the fish in an airtight container and place it in the refrigerator, where it will remain fresh for up to 3 days. If the trout is still in its foil packet, you can leave it wrapped in the foil as long as it\u2019s inside of an airtight container."
