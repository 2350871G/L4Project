A come-along is like a wide flat hoe with a wooden or fiberglass handle, used to rake and pull the plastic concrete ahead of the screed board to the correct height. For hard trowelled finished concrete, it would probably benefit you to rent a power trowel, but these are heavy and powerful machines, so use common sense where this applies."
