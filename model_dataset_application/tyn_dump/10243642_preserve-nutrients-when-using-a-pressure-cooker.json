Typically, the simplest method for quick-release pressure removal is to move the pressure cooker into your sink and apply cold water onto the top of the lid. All the pressure should release in less than 1 minute. Never submerge the pressure cooker in water during quick-release pressure removal. Ideally, use a pressure cooker with safety features that prevent you from removing the lid when there is still pressure within it. Check the owner's manual for specific instructions on quick-release pressure removal.

Maintaining a stable pressure is crucial for proper cooking and nutrient preservation. If you're using an electric pressure cooker, you don't need to worry about heat\u2014the appliance adjusts it automatically. To minimize burning on electric stoves (which have less burner reactivity), keep one burner on high-heat and one on low-heat.
