          "description":"Sugar snap peas flourish in cooler temperatures. You can put your seeds in the ground as early as the final frost of winter, just before the onset of spring. Even young plants will be hearty enough to survive one or two minor frosts in the interim. The ideal ground temperature for sugar snap peas is around 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C), but you're free to begin planting as soon as the soil has thawed enough to dig. Due to their preference for temperate conditions, pea plants won't do as well in warm, humid climates."

          "headline":"Find a plot of healthy soil.",
          "description":"Set aside an open space in one corner of your garden where the  growing snap peas can get plenty of indirect sunlight. The soil you use for planting should be nice and dark, with a high nutrient content. It also needs to be loose enough to encourage proper drainage and runoff after a heavy rain or weekly watering. Use a hand aerator or similar tool to punch a series of holes in the topsoil around the pea plant. These openings will ventilate the soil."

          "headline":"Add an inoculant to the soil to promote healthy growth.",
          "description":"Extremely cold, nutrient-poor soil may not have the nitrogen that sugar snaps need to grow to a healthy size. You can remedy this by sprinkling a natural inoculant into the soil prior to planting. One of these compounds may also help if you notice your plants are developing at an unusually slow rate. Alternatively, the seeds themselves can be dusted with an inoculant before they go into the ground. Inoculants are purely organic additives that can enhance a struggling plant\u2019s ability to absorb nitrogen from the soil. They can ordinarily be found wherever gardening supplies are sold."

          "headline":"Make sure the peas get enough sunlight.",
          "description":"Ideally, your plants should be situated somewhere where they can get about 6 hours of sun exposure per day. However, they\u2019ll also do just fine in partial shade. Too much sunlight can warm the soil around the plant, resulting in unfavorable growing conditions. If you\u2019ve planted your snap peas in a separate container, you\u2019ll have the advantage of being able to move them around to areas with more or less light as needed."

Any of these species can easily be cultivated at home using the same basic cultivation methods. Look for sugar snap pea cultivars at your local gardening center, greenhouse, or plant nursery.

You also have the option of planting your peas in a standalone pot.

Premade trellises can be purchased at most gardening centers and home improvement stores. They\u2019ll usually be large enough to support several plants at once.

If you live in a hot, dry area, a weekly watering should be enough to quench the thirsty roots. When irrigating your plants, use just enough water to thoroughly wet the uppermost layer of soil without allowing it to get too soggy. Snap peas don\u2019t need as much water as other types of edible crops. Your main goal should simply be to keep the soil from drying out. Avoid overwatering your snap peas.
