If your pad is too large or not in a position to be screeded from the outside, one person or both people must stand inside the pad and do your best to run the board along the 2x4s.

Doing this correctly should leave your pad flat and smooth with no holes. The \"wetter\" the concrete is, the easier it will seal all the holes up; if you wait to long to bull float, it will be hard to seal the surface.
