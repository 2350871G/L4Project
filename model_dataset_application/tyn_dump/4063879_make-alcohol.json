    "Pour the room temperature starter wort into your sanitized gallon container using a funnel.",
    "Add one package of liquid yeast.",
    "This is called \u201cpitching the yeast.\u201d Insert an airlock.",
    "You can also use a lock with tubing and submerge the other end in water.",
    "This will allow carbon dioxide to escape during the two weeks that it is stored.",
    "Boil 1 oz.",
    "(28 g) of corn sugar in one pint of water for 15 minutes.",
    "This is what makes the beer bubbly as it comes out of the bottle.",
    "It is called \u201cpriming sugar.\u201d Siphon the beer from the sediment into a bottling bucket.",
    "You will need to place your bucket below the level of the gallon bottle and run tubing between the two containers.",
    "Add your corn sugar syrup to the bucket.",
    "Siphon the beer from the bucket into sanitized bottles.",
    "Cap them securely.",
    "Wait six weeks to two months to open and drink your beer.",
    "Making Spirits Check with your county or state guidelines to see if it is legal to distill alcohol in your area.",
    "Order a two liter copper alembic pot still.",
    "If you want to brew larger batches, you can purchase stills up to five gallons (25 l).",
    "They constitute a more significant investment.",
    "Create a slow, steady heat source.",
    "Natural gas and propane are often used as heat sources.",
    "Ensure that your heat source is up to fire code and is in an area cleared of other objects or materials.",
    "You can also place a water bath on the heat source to improve the quality of your distillate.",
    "Sterilize your glasses and jars before you use them.",
    "You can clean your still by warming it slightly and pouring 1/4 cup (59 ml) of vinegar into the still.",
    "Add a tbsp.",
    "(18 g) of salt and insert a sponge to clean the interior of the still.",
    "Rinse it well with distilled water before using the still.",
    "Unused copper will oxidize, so copper pots should be cleaned regularly.",
    "Set your still on the heat source or in the water bath on the heat source.",
    "It should be three-fourths submerged.",
    "Fill the distillate with the wine you want to distill into spirits.",
    "It should fill the still approximately three-fourths full.",
    "Put the lid on the distillation pot.",
    "Run a tube from the lid to the condenser coil.",
    "Place cold water in the condenser.",
    "Place a sterilized glass below the spout.",
    "Screw all the fittings on tight when your still is assembled.",
    "You can seal the connections with a paste made of flour and water if they don\u2019t fit tightly.",
    "Cover the water bath, such as a Dutch oven, with aluminum foil to minimize evaporation.",
    "Turn on your heat source.",
    "Your water bath should heat to a full boil.",
    "Aim for the spout to drip once per second once it begins the distillation process.",
    "Adjust your heat until the alcohol flows at this speed.",
    "Practice by learning the smell of the fore shots, heads, hearts and tails.",
    "It is best to learn by example from an experienced distiller.",
    "The following are good guidelines, made safe through practice:\u201cThe fore shots\u201d are the alcohol that comes out first.",
    "They are high in acetone and methyl alcohol and are considered poisonous.",
    "They have a bad smell and you should discard them and the glass they are in.",
    "Combined with the heads, they are usually the first 50 - 100 mL of spirit to come out of the still.",
    "\u201cThe heads\u201d is a mix of unusable alcohol.",
    "It can be saved to distill two or three times to make it usable.",
    "\u201cThe hearts\u201d are the next glass.",
    "They are composed of ethanol.",
    "Aim to collect it at one drop every one to two seconds.",
    "Remove it in shot glass quantities to use.",
    "The hearts should smell pure.",
    "\u201cThe tails\u201d are the ethanol diluted with water.",
    "They smell less pure and pleasant.",
    "You can save them to distill like you dead the heads.",
    "Leave the hearts in a class for a few days, covered in cheesecloth.",
    "Extra acetone and methyl alcohol will evaporate.",
    "Age the alcohol in sanitized jars until you are ready to drink it.",
    "Redistillation can make a purer alcohol, but it is less safe, since the alcohol is highly flammable."
