Use a felt tip pen to draw lines on each end of the laces to indicate the excess that you want to remove. You can leave your shoes on when you mark the laces, but it\u2019s often easier to use a ruler to determine how many inches you want to remove from each end with the shoes on and then remove the laces to mark them. Shoelaces come in standard sizes, such as 30-, 40-, or 54-inches, so once you figure out how much excess there usually is on your shoes, you\u2019ll know where to mark laces of the same length in the future."

However, you\u2019ll want to make sure that it\u2019s a sharp pair to minimize fraying when you cut the laces. Follow the marks that you made to ensure that you cut at the right spot. Don\u2019t cut all of the excess off one end of the lace. You\u2019ll wind up with one finished end and one unfinished end, so they won\u2019t match when you relace your shoes."

You'll wind up with two pieces that each have an aglet at one end, so you only have to tie them together to create a single lace. Try on the shoes, use a ruler to see how much extra there is on each side, add the numbers together, and cut that amount for the middle of the lace. Tie the pieces of the lace together as tightly as possible, and secure it further by applying a small amount of instant glue to the knot and allowing it to dry. If there is any excess lace outside the knot, make sure to trim it away. You can also  sew the two pieces together."

          "description":"Lay a piece of adhesive tape sticky side on a flat surface, and place the lace towards the center. Take your time rolling the tape tightly around the lace to form a sturdy, finished tip, also known as the aglet. If there is any excess lace protruding past the tape, trim it with scissors. To make the tip extra sturdy, you can place a couple of dots of glue beneath the end of the table before you seal it over the lace. Finishing the ends with adhesive tape usually creates a tip that resembles plastic aglets on store bought laces well enough that you can get away with cutting the excess length off only one end of the lace if you prefer."

          "headline":"Apply glue to the ends.",
          "description":"Cover the tips of the laces with a small amount of glue, and as it starts to dry, press on the glue to help it absorb into the lace and reduce the thickness. Once the glue is completely dry, you can trim off any excess and apply another thin coat to increase the aglet\u2019s durability and give it a smoother look. Don\u2019t use \u201cinstant glue\u201d, such as Krazy Glue, because it will bond with your skin, making it impossible to shape the end of the lace. The best type of glue to use is one with an acetone-based solvent, such as Elmer\u2019s Clear Household Cement or Tarzan\u2019s Grip. They dry clear, and are waterproof, so they form ideal aglets. If you don\u2019t have any glue on hand, you can use clear nail polish in its place."

          "description":"Usually used to insulate electrical joints, the tubing is strong and flexible enough to work as effective aglets. You\u2019ll need to cut the tubing lengthwise to match the size of most aglets, which is typically about a \u00bd inch. Slip a section over each end of the lace, and then hold the tubing over a candle, lighter, or other flame so the material can contract. Choose a diameter of tubing that will slip over the end of your laces. In most cases, 4 to 5 millimeter is a good fit. When you\u2019re placing the tubing over the ends of the lace, it often helps to twist it into place so you don\u2019t wind up fraying the lace. It doesn\u2019t take much heat to shrink the tubing, so make sure to hold it a far enough distance from your flame. If it starts to smoke or bubble, it\u2019s too hot. If you have a small, travel-size hair straightening iron, you can use that to safely heat the tubing. Gently clamp it over the end for five to ten seconds to shrink the tubing and finish the laces. Clear heat shrink tubing will provide the most similar look to factory-made aglets."

Hold the end of the lace over a candle, match, lighter, or other flame to melt the material just enough to form a sealed edge. Make sure not to hold the lace too close to the flame, or you may light the entire lace on fire. It\u2019s best to melt the lace over a sink in case a fire does occur. Don\u2019t touch the synthetic material of the lace once it starts to melt because it may stick to your skin."
