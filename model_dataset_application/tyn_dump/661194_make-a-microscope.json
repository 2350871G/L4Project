Cover the edges of each lens by gluing on a rubber disc. Be sure that the discs do not cover the center of either lens. This creates a buffer between the lens and other objects. It also makes the microscope more aesthetically pleasing. Creating an Eyepiece Make a hole in a film canister. An eyepiece is not necessary to see objects, but it helps to keep your eye off of the viewing lens. It can also make viewing more comfortable. Use a drill or sharp object (e.g. scissors) to make a hole in the bottom of a film canister. The hole should be in the center of the canister and large enough to slide the smallest tube through. Push the lens tube through the hole. Line the smallest tube up with the hole in the canister. Push the tube so that the top (side with the lens) inch is inside the film canister. If the tube will not fit, make the hole larger until it does. Secure the eyepiece. Use glue or liquid cement to keep the eyepiece in place. This will allow you to look through the eyepiece without it moving. Give the glue time to dry. Building a Stand Start with a solid base. Use a square of plywood or plastic to set your base. Use a saw to cut the square to have 4 in (10 cm) sides. You want the base to be approximately 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) thick. Create a vertical stand. You can use a wooden cylinder to create a vertical stand. PVC pipe is another option. Cut the vertical stand to be 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) tall. Glue the vertical stand to the base plate. Secure the microscope tube to the vertical stand. The microscope tube should rest just above the base plate. This will allow you to place samples under the microscope lens. The tube can be secured to the vertical stand with glue or zip ties. Test your microscope. Gather a sample and view them under your microscope. You can start by looking at a drop of water, or a piece of hair. You can slide the eyepiece up and down to adjust the focus of the microscope.",
