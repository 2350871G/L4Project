Place all of the apples in a large 4-cup measuring cup. Pour cold water over the apples to fill the measuring cup up to the 4-cup mark. Place the water and apples in a large cooking pot. You can use any apples. Try Cortlands, Pink Ladies, Pippins, or Jonagolds. These will all cook down well. Using more than one type of apple will also give more depth of flavor to your jam."

Use a large shallow spoon and skim off foam that you see on the top of the jam. When your jam has cooled a little, taste it to adjust seasonings as needed.

Once the apples are soft (after cooking 3 or 4 hours), mash and strain them to remove the peels and seeds.

Cook a few more hours until the apple butter is thick and you can process it in 3 pint jars. You should never just cut back on the sugar in a jam recipe. Sugar is important for preserving the jam, so if you just reduce the sugar, your jam may not hold up as well over time. Instead, choose an apple butter recipe, which naturally uses less sugar."
