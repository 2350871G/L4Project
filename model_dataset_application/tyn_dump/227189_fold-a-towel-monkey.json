  "text":" Body Lay the bath towel out on a flat surface. Be sure to orient it in the \u201clandscape\u201d position in front of you (i.e. long sides up and down, short sides left and right). Roll the left and right sides of the towel inwards so that they meet in the middle. It may help to imagine that you\u2019re rolling up a scroll. Fold the rolled towel in half. The rolled ends should all be bunched together like a bouquet. Reach inside the rolled ends to find the towel corners and pull them out from the center of the rolls. Be sure to find all four corners. Hold the two corners from one end of the towel in one hand and the two corners from the other end in your other hand.  Pull towel ends gently apart. The rolled towel should try to unravel, forming four twisting sections. Gently drop one end of the towel and hang it by the remaining corners. You might clip them to a clothes hanger, for example. The towel should now look like the body of a monkey hanging by its forepaws. The Head Lay a hand towel out on a flat surface. Be sure to orient it in the \u201clandscape\u201d position in front of you (i.e. long sides up and down, short sides left and right). Bring the right side of the towel across to the left side so that it is folded in half.  Roll two opposite corners inwards so that they meet in the middle. (It doesn\u2019t doesn't matter which two so long as they\u2019re opposite each other.) Again, imagine you\u2019re rolling a scroll. Roll the newly made \"scroll\" snuggly from the folded end toward the open end. Make sure that the rolled lump is facing you when you\u2019re done. Pull one of the pointy corners at the open end down over the rolled fabric.  Pull the other pointy corner at the open end down away from the rolled fabric. This will form the head (upper flap with roll) and mouth (lower flap, folded back under the roll). Tuck the head between the arms of the monkey's body. The monkey is now complete!",
