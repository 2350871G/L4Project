Daniela Gutierrez-Diaz\t\t\tPattern Designer\t\t\t\tTake in a little at a time until the sleeves are the right size. Professional pattern-maker Daniela Gutierrez-Diaz says: \"Take in the sides of the sleeve by 1/4\" each, so it's reduced by about 1/2\" in total. If you need to, adjust the sides by about 1/16\" at a time until the sleeves lay flat on the side. Then, take in the cuff by about 1/16\". You'll also have to adjust the collar because if you're releasing the shoulder seams, then the corner will also have to be about 1/4\" smaller.\""
