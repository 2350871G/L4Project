If you do this without electrical tape, the strands of rope may fray outwards as they burn. A butane torch will do a better job of cauterizing the fibers, but you can use a lighter if you don\u2019t have one. The butane torch will heat the fibers more evenly and will result in a cleaner fusion at the end of the rope. Keep the flame at least 12 inches (30 cm) away from the flame of your butane torch.
