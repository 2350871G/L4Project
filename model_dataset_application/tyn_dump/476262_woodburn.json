Details will come out sharper and crisper when the surface of the wood is very smooth. When sanding, sand with the grain. The grain is the direction of the wood fibers. Sanding with the grain will minimize any tiny burrs or scratch marks that result from sanding against the grain. When you're done sanding, wipe the surface with a damp towel.

Transferring a Design onto Wood Choose which method of design transferring works best for you. While it's certainly possible to create art without the training wheels of a pencil design, most beginners find that having a design helps them.

It's not the easiest, most efficient way of getting down an outline, but it sidesteps the lifeless, cookie-cutter stiffness that many artists unwittingly produce when copying directly from another image.

If you're hunched over and burning perilously close to your belly, chances are it's going to be much harder to burn. Consider starting off on the bottom or outside edge of the outline. This way, if you mess up, your flaw won't be pointing you straight in the face. Rest assured though \u2014 you can correct most mistakes by simply sanding them out.

Try to move the pen towards you, not away from you, as you begin to burn, with your wrist resting on the wood if possible. Finish the outlines first.
