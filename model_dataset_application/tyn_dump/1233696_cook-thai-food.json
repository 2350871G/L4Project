You can find many traditional Thai herbs and spices at Asian grocery stores, in the Asian grocery aisle of your supermarket, and online. Getting these herbs will ensure the Thai food you prepare is authentic and flavorful. You should stock up on the following herbs:\nThai basil: This type of basil is sometimes called \u201cThai Sweet Basil\u201d and is known as \u201cbai horapha\u201d in Thai. It has smaller, darker leaves than Western sweet basil, with purple stems and flower buds. You will use the leaves in Thai curries and other Thai dishes. Coriander root and seeds: This root is known as \u201crahgk pak chee\u201d in Thai and is located at the end of the coriander plant. You will pound the root in the mortar and pestle to add to curry pastes and Thai soups. The coriander seeds, called \u201cmellet pak chee\u201d in Thai, are small and brown. You will use them in Thai curry pastes, sauces, and marinades. Galangal root: This root, called \u201chea-uh kah\u201d in Thai, is similar to ginger root, but has a more delicate flavor and texture. You can find it fresh at Thai grocery stores. You can also find it dried in slices, or ground up. You will add this root to Thai soups and curries. Kaffir lime: The leaves of the Kaffir lime, called \u201cma-goot\u201d in Thai, are a must have ingredient for Thai soups, curries, and stir-fries. You can also find the leaves dried or frozen, which you can add to Thai dishes. Cilantro: The cilantro leaves are used as garnishes on Thai dishes and in salads. The leaves and stems can be eaten raw. Thai chili peppers: These small red chilis are called \u201casprik kee noo\u201d in Thai and pack a spicy punch. They are added to Thai soups and curries."

You should get the following sauces and pastes:\nFish sauce: This is one of the most essential cooking ingredients in Thai cuisine, called \u201cnam pla\u201d in Thai. The use of fish sauce in Thai cooking is comparable to Chinese soy sauce or American table salt. It has a strong smell when uncooked but when added to dishes, it has a subtle flavor. Tamarind paste: You can buy tamarind paste pre made at Asian grocery stores or online. It is made by soaking tamarind seeds in water and squeezing out the seeds to extract the flavor, or paste. Curry paste: Though you can make your own Thai curry paste using a mortar and pestle, you can also buy Thai curry paste in stores and online.

If you do not want to buy a mortar and pestle, you can use a small food processor or a coffee grinder. Make sure the coffee grinder is only used for Thai spices and herbs as you do not want any other flavors to contaminate the food. Get a rice cooker. Many Thai dishes are served over jasmine rice. You should invest in an automatic electric rice cooker so you can cook rice quickly and easily. You can find rice cookers online or at Asian grocery stores. You can always prepare rice on your stovetop at home if you do not want to buy a rice cooker. But you may need to add more time to a recipe so you can cook the rice on the stovetop. Buy a steamer. Many Thai dishes require the use of a traditional steamer. These steamers are often made of bamboo or woven fibers. You can also get steamers made of metal. Look for steamers online or at most cooking stores. The steamers will be round and stackable, making it easier to steam food over a container of boiling water. The steam will then rise through the steamers, cooking the food efficiently and quickly. Invest in a good chef\u2019s knife. A good chef\u2019s knife is essential to Thai cooking, and any other cooking you do in the kitchen. A chef\u2019s knife should be large enough to chop vegetables, herbs, meat, and fruit. It should have a strong, high quality blade and be comfortable to hold in your hand. Investing in a good chef\u2019s knife will make chopping up Thai ingredients much easier. You may not have the funds to invest in a high quality chef\u2019s knife. You can use a basic knife for chopping and slicing, as long as you make sure it is sharpened before use. Sharpening the knife will make it easier, and safer, to use in the kitchen. Finding Thai Ingredients Get Thai herbs and spices. One of the key elements of Thai cooking is using the right herbs and spices. You can find many traditional Thai herbs and spices at Asian grocery stores, in the Asian grocery aisle of your supermarket, and online. Getting these herbs will ensure the Thai food you prepare is authentic and flavorful. You should stock up on the following herbs:\nThai basil: This type of basil is sometimes called \u201cThai Sweet Basil\u201d and is known as \u201cbai horapha\u201d in Thai. It has smaller, darker leaves than Western sweet basil, with purple stems and flower buds. You will use the leaves in Thai curries and other Thai dishes. Coriander root and seeds: This root is known as \u201crahgk pak chee\u201d in Thai and is located at the end of the coriander plant. You will pound the root in the mortar and pestle to add to curry pastes and Thai soups. The coriander seeds, called \u201cmellet pak chee\u201d in Thai, are small and brown. You will use them in Thai curry pastes, sauces, and marinades. Galangal root: This root, called \u201chea-uh kah\u201d in Thai, is similar to ginger root, but has a more delicate flavor and texture. You can find it fresh at Thai grocery stores. You can also find it dried in slices, or ground up. You will add this root to Thai soups and curries. Kaffir lime: The leaves of the Kaffir lime, called \u201cma-goot\u201d in Thai, are a must have ingredient for Thai soups, curries, and stir-fries. You can also find the leaves dried or frozen, which you can add to Thai dishes. Cilantro: The cilantro leaves are used as garnishes on Thai dishes and in salads. The leaves and stems can be eaten raw. Thai chili peppers: These small red chilis are called \u201casprik kee noo\u201d in Thai and pack a spicy punch. They are added to Thai soups and curries. Buy traditional Thai sauces and pastes. You should also invest in Thai sauces and pastes that you will reach for often when you are cooking Thai dishes. These sauces and pastes can be found at most Asian grocery stores as well as online. You should get the following sauces and pastes:\nFish sauce: This is one of the most essential cooking ingredients in Thai cuisine, called \u201cnam pla\u201d in Thai. The use of fish sauce in Thai cooking is comparable to Chinese soy sauce or American table salt. It has a strong smell when uncooked but when added to dishes, it has a subtle flavor. Tamarind paste: You can buy tamarind paste pre made at Asian grocery stores or online. It is made by soaking tamarind seeds in water and squeezing out the seeds to extract the flavor, or paste. Curry paste: Though you can make your own Thai curry paste using a mortar and pestle, you can also buy Thai curry paste in stores and online. Using authentic Thai curry paste will make it much quicker and easier to prepare Thai curries. Get palm oil, coconut milk, and palm sugar. Many Thai dishes call for the use of palm oil, coconut milk, and palm sugar. You can find these ingredients at Asian grocery stores or online. Palm oil is used for frying foods in the wok and for flavoring soups. If you do not have access to palm oil, you can use a lighter oil like canola, sunflower or peanut oil. Coconut milk is made by straining and squeezing coconuts for the juice inside. It is often used for Thai curries and soups. You can find coconut milk in cans at the grocery store. Make sure you always stir the can before you use it so the heavy cream on top is mixed into the juice. Another popular Thai ingredient is palm sugar, which is used to sweeten curries and soups. It is made from the sap of the coconut palm flower.",

    "You will then cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes until the ingredients form a syrup.",
    "Set the sauce aside until you need it for the Pad Thai.",
    "Soak the rice noodles.",
    "Start by soaking the rice noodles in cool or lukewarm water for 40 minutes.",

    "Then, remove them from the oven to cool.",
    "You can crush the peanuts in the mortar and pestle.",
    "Heat the wok over high heat.",
    "You can also use a 12\u201d skillet if you do not have a wok.",
    "Once the wok is hot, add 2 teaspoons of cooking oil.",
    "Then, add the garlic and stir it quickly in the oil for about 30 seconds.",
    "Add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink.",
    "If you\u2019re using pork, cook the pork until it is brown.",
    "Then, remove the protein from the wok and put it on a plate.",

    "Combine the noodles with the other ingredients, stir-frying them for one to two minutes until the noodles are soft.",
    "If you have a large wok, you may be able to fit all the noodles in one batch.",
    "If you have a smaller wok, you will need to stir-fry them in two batches.",
