Chop up your dried fruit or fruits of choice and add 1 cup (150g) to the grains and nuts. Dates, raisins, dehydrated berries, or even dried mango or papaya pieces all make great additions to muesli. Choose fruits that you like and try different combinations until you find the perfect recipe. Try to find dried fruits without added sugar. As none of the other ingredients are particularly sweet, the fruit should add enough sweetness without relying on more sugar. Only add dried fruit to your muesli recipe, as fresh fruit in it will soften your muesli and make it turn bad much more quickly. If you want to add fresh fruit, do so just before you eat it."
