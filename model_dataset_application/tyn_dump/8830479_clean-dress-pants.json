Rinse off the salt and apply the cleaner from the inside of the pants (which will depend on the type of fabric the pants are made of). Lay a paper towel on the stain, let it sit for an hour, and then rinse off the area where the stain was. Use light acids, like lemon and vinegar, on cotton pants. Apply a wool detergent to wool pants. Use a standard laundry detergent or dish soap on pants made out of synthetic materials, like rayon and polyester. Silk is very sensitive, so soak the pants entirely when spot-cleaning silk pants. Apply glycerin to the stain."

Try to avoid hanging your pants in a place that is very humid. Hang your pants in an area that maintains a 40-50% humidity level."
