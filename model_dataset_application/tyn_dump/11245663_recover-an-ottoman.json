          "description":"If your ottoman is elevated off of the ground by pegs or wheels, start by removing them. Some ottomans will have wheels or pegs that slide directly out, so try pulling a peg or wheel out first to see if it budges. Unscrew the brackets attaching any wheels with a screwdriver. Unscrew pegs by twisting them counterclockwise. Set these pieces aside to reinstall them later. You may have to apply some firm pressure to the pegs to get them to turn. Don\u2019t worry about breaking them since you can always install new pegs later or let the ottoman sit directly on the floor if you break them off."

          "description":"Depending on the style of your ottoman, there is probably a fabric sheet stapled underneath the frame to cover the hollow center. If you don\u2019t plan on keeping this cover, you can simply rip it off by cutting the center with a utility knife and tearing the edges off. If you do want to keep it, use the sharp point on a painter\u2019s tool, a staple remover, or pliers to pry out the staples affixing the fabric to the frame. Some ottomans use Velcro to keep this fabric attached. Simply pull the cover off if this is the case. If you keep the cover, you can re-staple it into the frame later. If you don\u2019t, you can always make a new cover."

If it isn\u2019t stapled in and doesn\u2019t fold up where it meets the wood, it is probably glued into the frame. If this is the case, or your ottoman is stuffed-leather, you probably cannot remove the fabric without destroying the frame or padding.

          "description":"Many ottomans are one solid piece, but if your ottoman has a pleat in the middle, it is probably 2 separate pieces screwed together. Look inside the hollow opening at the bottom of your ottoman and inspect the section corresponding to the pleat on the outside. If there is a 2x4 or supporting frame with screws, use a drill or screwdriver to remove the screws and take the frame out. This will turn your ottoman into 2 different pieces to make it easier to remove and replace the fabric. Perform each corresponding step twice. Once for the top section and once for the bottom. If you do this and your ottoman doesn\u2019t come apart, the fabric is probably stapled into the frame at the junction where the 2 pieces meet."

          "description":"If there are staples used to attach the ottoman\u2019s fabric to the furniture, use the sharp point on a painter\u2019s tool to pry the staples out. If the fabric is stitched into the bottom, use a utility knife to cut through the fabric around the entire outside of the stitching. If you cut around the stitching, you\u2019re going to be carving into the frame a little bit. This shouldn\u2019t harm the structural integrity of your ottoman though, and any marks that you make will be covered by the time that you\u2019re done. You can use wire cutters, a flathead screwdriver, or pliers instead of a painter\u2019s tool to remove the staples if you prefer. It really depends on how strong and big the staples are when it comes to finding the right tool to remove them. Some ottomans will use both staples and stitching. Repeat this process on the second half of your ottoman if you separated it into 2 pieces."

          "description":"Brace the frame of the ottoman with your nondominant hand and peel the rest of the fabric off by pulling on it with your other hand. If there are any staples remaining elsewhere on the fabric, use a flathead screwdriver to pry the fabric away from the ottoman. Stick the screwdriver\u2019s head between the fabric and a stapled section. Push the handle away from the ottoman to pry the stapled section off. Be careful and do this slowly. You could damage the padding if you rip the fabric off too quickly and you don\u2019t want to cut your hand on a staple."

If you have a circular ottoman, measure from one portion of the base to the base on the opposite side.

    "If you do want to keep it, use the sharp point on a painter\u2019s tool, a staple remover, or pliers to pry out the staples affixing the fabric to the frame.",
    "Some ottomans use Velcro to keep this fabric attached.",
    "Simply pull the cover off if this is the case.",
    "If you keep the cover, you can re-staple it into the frame later.",
    "If you don\u2019t, you can always make a new cover.",
    "Leave the fabric alone if it\u2019s stuffed-leather or glued into the frame.",
    "After removing the bottom, inspect the edge of the fabric in the base of the frame.",
    "If it isn\u2019t stapled in and doesn\u2019t fold up where it meets the wood, it is probably glued into the frame.",
    "If this is the case, or your ottoman is stuffed-leather, you probably cannot remove the fabric without destroying the frame or padding.",
    "You can skip the remaining steps and start measuring your new fabric.Tip: If you put new fabric on top of your old ottoman, you\u2019re not technically recovering it; you\u2019re simply making a case.",
    "This doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be elegant though!",
    "Flip the hollow side up and use a drill or screwdriver to disconnect the top.",
    "Many ottomans are one solid piece, but if your ottoman has a pleat in the middle, it is probably 2 separate pieces screwed together.",
    "Look inside the hollow opening at the bottom of your ottoman and inspect the section corresponding to the pleat on the outside.",
    "If there is a 2x4 or supporting frame with screws, use a drill or screwdriver to remove the screws and take the frame out.",
    "This will turn your ottoman into 2 different pieces to make it easier to remove and replace the fabric.",
    "Perform each corresponding step twice.",
    "Once for the top section and once for the bottom.",
    "If you do this and your ottoman doesn\u2019t come apart, the fabric is probably stapled into the frame at the junction where the 2 pieces meet.",
    "Separate the fabric from the frame by prying the staples or cutting the fabric.",
    "If there are staples used to attach the ottoman\u2019s fabric to the furniture, use the sharp point on a painter\u2019s tool to pry the staples out.",
    "If the fabric is stitched into the bottom, use a utility knife to cut through the fabric around the entire outside of the stitching.",
    "If you cut around the stitching, you\u2019re going to be carving into the frame a little bit.",
    "This shouldn\u2019t harm the structural integrity of your ottoman though, and any marks that you make will be covered by the time that you\u2019re done.",
    "You can use wire cutters, a flathead screwdriver, or pliers instead of a painter\u2019s tool to remove the staples if you prefer.",
    "It really depends on how strong and big the staples are when it comes to finding the right tool to remove them.",
    "Some ottomans will use both staples and stitching.",
    "Repeat this process on the second half of your ottoman if you separated it into 2 pieces.",
    "Remove the fabric cover by hand by peeling it off.",
    "Brace the frame of the ottoman with your nondominant hand and peel the rest of the fabric off by pulling on it with your other hand.",
    "If there are any staples remaining elsewhere on the fabric, use a flathead screwdriver to pry the fabric away from the ottoman.",
    "Stick the screwdriver\u2019s head between the fabric and a stapled section.",
    "Push the handle away from the ottoman to pry the stapled section off.",
    "Be careful and do this slowly.",
    "You could damage the padding if you rip the fabric off too quickly and you don\u2019t want to cut your hand on a staple.",
    "Choosing and Cutting the New Fabric Select a thick fabric that can be easily cut and buy some wide sheets.",
    "Cotton blends and synthetic fabrics, like acrylic, will be easier to work with than silk or linen.",
    "Choose a thicker fabric that won\u2019t rip easily when you fold it.",
    "Choose darker colors to make it easier to hide mistakes or structures underneath.",
    "Buy rolls of fabric that are at least 4 times the length of your ottoman in any direction.",
    "You can buy fabric rolls from a knitting or craft store.",
    "You can also order custom sheets online if you want precut fabric.",
    "Measure the length of the top and sides of your ottoman.",
    "Use a measuring tape to determine the length and width of the top of your ottoman.",
    "Draw and label this portion on a piece of paper.",
    "Then, measure each side all the way to the base.",
    "Add these labels to your drawing by illustrating the 4 sides as separate boxes that share a side with your center box.",
    "If you have a circular ottoman, measure from one portion of the base to the base on the opposite side.",
    "Do this on the adjacent side to determine how big of a square you will need to cover the ottoman.",
    "You will use 2 sheets if you separated your ottoman into 2 parts.",
    "Alternatively, you can use the fabric pieces that you pulled off as a template.",
    "Just add 6 inches (15 cm) to each side to give you enough room to maneuver the fabric.",
    "Extend your drawing and connect the exterior lines.",
    "Your drawing should now look like a cross-shaped set of 5 boxes.",
    "Add 2 extending lines out of every exterior side until each corner meets the adjacent line and forms a 90-degree angle.",
    "Add 12 inches (30 cm) to every exterior edge.Tip: You are going to use a single sheet of fabric to cover your ottoman.",
    "To fit the corners, you will fold the fabric along the corner to make a seam.",
    "Your drawing should now look like 9 squares inside of a larger square.",
    "Add the measurements for the bottom cover if you\u2019re using one.",
    "If you\u2019re making a new bottom cover, use the measurement for the top as the measurement for the bottom cover.",
    "Add 6 inches (15 cm) on each side to ensure that you have enough room to stretch it over your base.",
    "You are going to cut or fold the excess fabric later.",
    "It is better to have too much fabric after you\u2019ve attached it than to have too little fabric to attach to your base.",
    "Spread your fabric out over a flat surface and mark your cuts.",
    "Spread your sheet of fabric out across the floor or a flat table.",
    "Place it upside-down and use a fabric marker to mark each cut that you need to make.",
    "Only mark the 4 exterior edges from your drawing.",
    "You can do this in 3 pieces if you know how to sew.",
    "If you do this, use 1 piece for the top and then 2 sides per section of fabric.",
    "You can sew the 2 corners and 4 lines on the top after stapling it in place.",
    "You can place the ottoman\u2019s frame upside-down in the center of the fabric if you want to make it easier to visualize where you\u2019re going to cut.",
    "Use a rotary cutter and a cutting board to split your fabric.",
    "Place a cutting board underneath any corner.",
    "Place a ruler or second cutting board on top of the fabric and apply pressure with your nondominant hand to keep it still.",
    "Push the blade out of your rotary cutter to release it.",
    "Press it into your fabric, using the straight edge as the guide for your cut.",
    "Slide the rotary cutter along your line, moving the cutting board and straight edge further along the line after each section that you cut.",
    "Don\u2019t forget to cut your bottom cover out if you aren\u2019t using the old one.",
    "If you\u2019re cutting out a new cover, leave an extra 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) on each side.",
    "Check to make sure that the fabric will fit.",
    "Before you start stapling or folding anything, pull each side up to your base and use binder clips to keep it in place along the frame.",
    "This will also help you picture what the final product should look like.",
    "Set your excess fabric aside.",
    "You may need to cover a section if it tears.",
    "Installing Your New Cover Place your fabric face down and flip the ottoman over.",
    "Find a clean section of your floor or put the fabric upside-down on a large table.",
    "Spread the fabric out so that it is flat as possible to avoid any bumps or wrinkles.",
    "Place the ottoman upside-down in the center of your fabric.",
    "Stapling the new cover in while looking at the bottom will not only make it easier to see where you\u2019re stapling, but will keep the fabric centered on the top of the ottoman.",
    "Fold each side up to the frame to ensure that you\u2019ve place the ottoman correctly in the center.",
    "If you haven\u2019t, lift the ottoman up and move it before checking again.",
    "Continue to do this until your 4 sides are centered.",
    "If you\u2019re covering a round ottoman, simply check to make sure that you have enough fabric on each side to reach the bottom of your frame.",
    "Staple the middle sections of each side into the bottom of your frame.",
    "Pull the fabric on one side up and put 1 staple through the center into the frame once it is flush on the side.",
    "Repeat this for each side.",
    "Then, start in the middle of one of your sides to ensure that your fabric doesn\u2019t slide to either side as you\u2019re stapling.",
    "Place 1 staple every 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) until you reach the last 3\u20135 inches (7.6\u201312.7 cm) near the corner.Tip: Leave at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of fabric at each corner unstapled.",
    "This will give you enough room to fold the corners back and make them flush with the edge of the frame.",
    "If you have a circular ottoman, choose 3-5 6 in (15 cm) sections to leave unstapled.",
    "Fold the seam along the corner by pulling the fabric tight towards the center.",
    "Pull the unstapled corner of your fabric up so that it matches the corner of your frame.",
    "Pull the corner inwards towards the center of the ottoman while sliding the excess fabric on either side underneath it.",
    "Once the fabric is folded on top of itself, hold it still by applying pressure to the top with your nondominant hand.",
    "If your ottoman is round, fold only one side of the fabric underneath itself.",
    "Fold the fabric in the same direction for every seam that you make.",
    "Punch 3-4 staples through your fabric into the frame.",
    "Keep the corner braced with your nondominant hand and pick up your staple gun in your dominant hand.",
    "Use your staple gun to shoot 3-4 staples into the frame.",
    "Spread your staples out along the folded corner so that every folded side has at least 1 staple attaching it to the frame.",
    "Leave at least 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) between your nondominant hand and the staple gun to keep your other hand safe.",
    "Repeat this process for every corner of your ottoman.",
    "If you have 2 sections, you\u2019ll need to do this a total of 8 times, since each piece will have 4 corners.",
    "With each fold, check the seam along the frame\u2019s side to ensure that it is folding in the same direction every time.",
    "If it isn\u2019t, simply re-fold your corner so that the seam folds in the other direction.",
    "If you separated your ottoman into 2 pieces, you can either keep the fabric in the middle of your bottom piece, or cut along the edges of your frame with your utility knife to remove it.",
    "Cut the excess fabric or fold it over itself.",
    "You can fold the fabric over itself 2-3 times to flatten it, or simply cut it off with sewing scissors.",
    "If you fold it, pull the excess fabric up and fold the fabric to the left or the right down against the opposite side by sliding your other hand over it as you fold.",
    "Use 2-3 staples to secure the additional folds to the fabric.",
    "Use the same folding direction and style of fold for every corner.",
    "Staple your bottom cover into the base of your fabric.",
    "Place your rectangular or circular cover over the center opening.",
    "Place one staple into the middle of any side and stretch the cover across the opposite side before placing a staple on the opposite side.",
    "Repeat this process while working around the frame and place a staple for every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of frame.",
    "Place your staples above or below the staples for your upholstery.",
    "Use sewing scissors to trim the excess fabric if you cut out a new cover for the bottom.",
    "You won\u2019t need to trim anything if you\u2019re using the old covers.",
    "Reinstall your wheels or pegs by screwing them back in.",
    "Use your utility knife to cut a 1 inch (2.5 cm) X-shaped slit through the fabric where your wheels or pegs belong.",
    "Either screw your peg back in by rotating it into the threading of the frame, or use a screwdriver to reinstall the brackets where they belong with the original screws.",
    "You may need to cut several openings if the bracket for your screws was particularly big.",
    "You can also opt to use the flat base of your ottoman as the bottom and choose to simply not use the pegs or the wheels."
