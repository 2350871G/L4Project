Screw on the top of the pot and set it on your stove over low heat. Heat the espresso until you hear gurgling and the water boils. Turn off the heat once the moka pot is full of espresso. Stir the pot and use the espresso right away. Avoid packing down the espresso in the strainer. This can clog your moka pot. You should heat the moka pot for 5 to 7 minutes."

Set the the chamber on top of the glass you want to serve the cappuccino in and measure 1 mounded scoop coffee into the chamber. Carefully pour boiling hot water up to the one mark. Stir the espresso for 10 seconds and then insert the aeropress plunger into the chamber. Slowly press down until you hit the grounds. This will extract the espresso. Use fine-ground coffee in the aeropress and shake it once it's in the chamber. This will ensure that the espresso is extracted evenly."

For example, if you want to make an 8-ounce (236 ml) cappuccino, you'll need to pour in 10 to 12 ounces (295 to 355 ml) of milk. This will allow the milk to expand and make it easier to pour.

Once it steams a little, turn it off and then insert it into the pitcher of milk. Immediately turn the wand back on and tilt the pitcher at a slight angle, so the milk heats and swirls. If you're new to steaming milk, you may want to clip a thermometer to the inside of the pitcher, so you can track how quickly the milk heats up.

You'll only need to do this for a few seconds or you'll risk making a lot of really dry foam. When you notice the milk getting around 150 to 160 degrees F (65 to 70 C), turn off the steam wand and remove the milk pitcher. Remember to purge the steam wand and wipe it clean with a wet cloth once you've finished steaming the milk. The steamed milk should be glossy and smooth, not dry or lumpy. Keep one of your hands on the side of the pitcher, so you can feel how hot it's getting. Remove your hand when it gets around 150 to 160 degrees F (65 to 70 C)."

Place nonfat or low-fat milk into a small mason jar, so that it's at least half full. Put the lid on the jar and shake it for 30 seconds to 1 minute, so the milk foams up a lot.
