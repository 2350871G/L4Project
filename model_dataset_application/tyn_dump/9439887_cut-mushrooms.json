Go over the outside of the caps using light sweeping strokes to clear away any dirt or sediment that\u2019s clinging to the outside. When the mushrooms are clean, transfer them to a bowl or colander and place them near your prep area. Don\u2019t rinse or soak mushrooms. Their soft, porous structure soaks up water like a sponge, which can cause them to turn out mushy and flavorless once they\u2019re cooked. To clean odd or irregularly-shaped mushrooms, such as morels, place them in a colander and rinse them quickly under a stream of cool water. Then, use a soft-bristled brush to clear away any dirt and debris between the folds and pat the outer surface dry with a paper towel. If the mushrooms look sufficiently clean already, it\u2019s okay to forego the wipedown and skip straight to cutting."

          "description":"A standard kitchen or paring knife is usually best for slicing and chopping tasks, but any cutting utensil will work as long as it has a well-honed edge. Since mushrooms have such a naturally soft texture, a dull blade can quickly make a mess of them. Avoid knives with serrated edges. The proper cutting method for mushrooms is a blade stroke sawing them will more than likely mangle the meat. Sharpen your knives regularly to make sure they\u2019re up to the task of processing delicate ingredients."

Keep your bowl of clean mushrooms beside you, and have another container close at hand to put them in after slicing."

Be sure to handle the cap gingerly to avoid mashing or otherwise damaging it. If you\u2019re right-handed, hold the mushroom with your left hand and do your cutting with your right.

The stems of most mushrooms aren\u2019t typically eaten, so you can simply dispose of them. Mushroom stems tend to be tough and fibrous, meaning they\u2019re far less appetizing than the tender caps. Removing the stems also creates a flat base to stand the rest of the mushroom on, making them easier to slice and dice."

There should be about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) of clearance between your fingertips and the blade. A tucked hand position is the safest technique for preparing ingredients like mushrooms that require a lot of small, quick cuts."

Reset the blade and make another cut, using your knuckles as a guide. Move your knife and guide hand together until you've sliced the whole mushroom. As you begin cutting, your hand will slide slowly along the length of the mushroom, and the knife will move right along with it. Aim to make each of the slices the same thickness. Thinly-sliced mushrooms work well in dishes like pizza, pasta, and omelettes, while thicker slices work well for saut\u00e9s and vegetable medleys."

Chopped mushrooms are the perfect size to throw in a pot of soup or a hearty casserole. You also have the option of stopping after a single cut if you prefer bigger pieces.
