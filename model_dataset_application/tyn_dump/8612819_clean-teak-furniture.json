This will help you avoid any streaks or irregularities caused by the cleaning solution or the cleaning process. Starting at the top may be tempting, as it is the most visible part of your teak furniture. But beginning here could damage your furniture, or make it become more unsightly."

This kind of maintenance will prevent discoloration and the buildup of grime and mildew. Simply apply some mild liquid soap to a sponge and wipe down the surface. You can also add a bit of bleach or vinegar to the soap to get it extra clean."

If you are cleaning your teak furniture outside, use a garden hose to rinse off the soap. If you are cleaning the teak furniture indoors, use a damp cloth to remove the soap residue. Be sure to frequently rinse the cloth out so that you don\u2019t keep reapplying the soapy water. Let the teak furniture air dry when you finish rinsing it off."

If you have cushions on your teak furniture, you should consider storing them separately from the teak furniture itself. This will help your teak furniture look nicer for a longer period of time. This is especially important when it\u2019s raining, and right after you\u2019ve oiled the teak wood."

It may seem like a simple solution, but it can wear down the surface of the teak wood over time and cause more damage. If cracks develop in the wood, shooting water into the cracks at high velocities will cause the wood to become deformed over time. Pressure washing can also remove any finish that might be protecting the teak wood, causing more damage in the long run."

Gently scrub away any stains or imperfections in the wood. But don\u2019t scrub too hard or you might damage the wood permanently. Getting the teak wood wet first can help the scrubbing process be more effective. And a constant flow of water will help rinse away any dirt or grime as you clean."

So it may be better suited for teak furniture that has been left outdoors for long periods of time. Simply apply the teak cleaning solution to the furniture and scrub it in with a soft brush. Generally, you should let it remain on the teak for 15 minutes or so before you rinse it off with the hose. Follow the directions for application on the bottle. Look for the active ingredient oxalic acid in any store-bought teak cleaner."

Once you start noticing more cracks in the teak wood, you\u2019ll need to start thinking about staining it again to seal up those cracks and protect the wood.

Consider storing your outdoor teak furniture in a shed completely away from the sunlight during the winter months when you aren\u2019t using it as much."
