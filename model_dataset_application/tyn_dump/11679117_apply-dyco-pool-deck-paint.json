Mix a concrete repair compound according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and fill in all holes and cracks, then let the compound dry for 24 hours.Tip: If the pool deck only has thin cracks, get a concrete filler that you can apply with a caulking gun to easily fill them in. If there are bigger holes, use a concrete patching compound that comes in a tub and apply it with a putty knife. Dyco pool deck acrylic stain is only for concrete applications.

Start at 1 side of the pool deck and dip a long-handled, stiff-bristled brush into the cleaning solution or pour some out onto the concrete to wet a small area. Scrub the concrete vigorously using back and forth motions to clean it. This will get rid of dirt, dust, oils, soap film, and any other residues stuck to the concrete pool deck to prepare it for the stain. Don\u2019t use a brush that has metal bristles or you could scratch and damage the concrete. Note that it is not necessary to prime the concrete in any way before you apply the stain.
