  "text":" Dyeing Carnations Get a fresh, white carnation. Avoid using wilted ones, as they won't take up the dye as well. You can use more carnations if you want to. Cut the end of the carnation off at an angle. It would be even better if you submerged the stem in water first, then cut the ends off underwater. This will prevent air bubbles from forming at the base of the stem. Air bubbles can clog up the stem, and prevent the colored water from flowing as well. Fill a jar with warm water. You will need at least \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of water. How much you use depends on the size of jar you are using. The flower will soak up warm water much faster than cool water.

You can dye just one carnation, if you want to, but because you will be using so much water and dye for this method, you might as well dye a whole bunch.
