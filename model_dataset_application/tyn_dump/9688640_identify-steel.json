Carbon steel, used in pipes and buildings, is a dark brown color. Stainless steel, used in kitchens, is silver and shiny. In addition, reddish rust spots are an indication that the metal is steel.

Most other common metals, including aluminum, aren't magnetic. If the magnet sticks, the metal is most likely steel. Other magnetic metals are either rare or not used in pure forms. Cobalt and nickel, for example, are often components in steel. Some stainless steel is not magnetic. When nickel is added during manufacturing, the magnetism fades.

Stainless steel feels much heavier than aluminum. Steel feels stronger, more solid, and less prone to breaking in your hands. To get used to the differences between these metals, compare household objects. For example, an aluminum can feels much different than a steel cup or utensil."

Steel is a relatively hard metal, so filing off fragments should take some work. Depending on the file\u2019s hardness, you may not even be able to wear off any of the metal this way. Look up the Moh\u2019s scale for metals to compare hardness ratings. In contrast, lead, aluminum, silver, and many other metals are softer than steel. Wearing them down with the file is easier. Hardened steel, which has a medium to high carbon content, is stronger than all but a few metals. Most metal files won\u2019t affect it."

All the streaks are different lengths. The ends of the sparks fan out into tiny branches or \u201cleaves,\u201d like on a tree. Search online for a visual aid by searching for the steel spark test. Both wrought iron and stainless steel produce long, even yellow streaks. The leaves on the end are smaller in stainless steel sparks. Steel made with less carbon produces yellow sparks with different lengths. The leaves on the end fan out more with a lot of extra little branches. Steel with high amounts of carbon produce sparks that begin spreading out near the grinding wheel. The sparks are duller or even red and fan out less at the end. Some metals, including nickel and aluminum, produce few or no sparks."
