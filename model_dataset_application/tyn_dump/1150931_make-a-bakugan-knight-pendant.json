If the marker is new, or isn't painting well, you will need to prime it; shake the marker up and down for a couple of minutes (you should eventually hear the agitator sliding back and forth inside the marker), then press the marker tip down onto a scrap piece of thick paper or cardboard so that the tip retracts into the marker. Paint will start to flow into the spongy tip. It will easily make a mess, so be careful when doing this step!"

It is important to watch them during this process as they run the danger of curling up and sticking to themselves, thus preventing them from flattening out properly. Grab a chair and sit where you can see the pieces as they draw up, and keep the pair of wooden skewers or chopsticks on hand to reach into the oven and pull the pieces apart if they start curling into themselves.
