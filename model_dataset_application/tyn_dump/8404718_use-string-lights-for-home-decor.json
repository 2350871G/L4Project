Simply drape or wrap the lights on the object, or attach the lights in place with things like adhesive hooks, pushpins, and tape.

You can also add tissue paper or a transparent, glossy kind of wrapping paper to the bottles to create this effect. Short string lights with battery packs are excellent for making this kind of craft.

    "Hang a net of lights in front of displays.",
    "Wall decorations, like pictures, curio cabinets, and knickknack shelves are perfect to either have a net of lights in front of or behind.",
    "This can give a kind of underwater or otherworldly appearance to your displays.",
    "Hang two separate lines of plain string or twine above or behind your display.",
    "Pushpins, adhesive hooks, and nails work well for hanging.",
    "Run your string lights between the two plain strings, allowing plenty of the string light to hang in a loop below the plain string.",
    "Repeat this process for another row of lights.",
    "The bottom of your first row and top of your second should be roughly the same height."
