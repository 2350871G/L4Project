You can also cut an 8 1/2 by 11-inch (22 by 28-cm) rectangle out of white poster paper, and use that instead. If you can't find 8 1/2 by 11-inch (22 by 28-cm) paper, use A4 sized paper.

Use a glue stick for paper and tacky glue for felt or fabric. If you don't want to cut and glue the cross, draw it on with a red marker.

Set the cap on top of your head, and position it just in front of the bun. Slide bobby pins up through your hair and onto the sides of the cap. Use at least 1 bobby pin on each side. You don't have to put your hair up, but it will look more professional. If you really want to keep your hair down, consider pulling it back into a half-up ponytail. This will give the cap something to clip to."
