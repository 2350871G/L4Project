          "description":"Every refrigerator has one. This is a gasket (or seal) that is made out of molded rubber. The function of the gasket is to keep cold in and to keep heat out of the refrigerator. Essentially, it seals the colder air in, and prevents air outside the refrigerator from seeping in. The reason this matters is because a bad or worn seal will allow cold air to leave the refrigerator, and warm air to enter it. This means that temperatures in the refrigerator could increase, causing the food inside it to spoil more quickly. It will also cost you more money in energy."

          "headline":"Determine whether you need to replace the door seal after all.",
          "description":"If there are gaps between the gasket on the door and the refrigerator gasket, it\u2019s not sealing correctly. One way to tell that you need a new gasket is if your refrigerator seems to be running more frequently, or you just think it seems like it\u2019s losing cold air. You could also inspect the door gasket for condensation or blackish mold. If you see either of those things, you probably need a new gasket because the cold air is making the water in the warm air condense. If you see cracks or thinning of the gasket, it\u2019s also probably time for a new one. You could also test the gasket with a dollar bill. Put the dollar bill between the refrigerator door and refrigerator, and close the door on it. Then, try to pull it out slowly. If you feel it drag slightly, your gasket doesn\u2019t need replacing. If it slips out quickly or has moisture on it or mold, get a new gasket. You will need to do one of two things: repair the gaps in the gasket or replace it altogether. Replacing a faulty seal will save you money by not wasting energy. It\u2019s not very expensive to buy a new gasket. It just costs about $50 to $75, and it should only take about 30 minutes to replace. You will save energy, so it will pay for itself fast."

Pack the corner with it by placing it along the channel of the door gasket. Push the gasket back in the channel. Repeat the process, and pack other corners if you think that\u2019s needed. Close the refrigerator door again and look for gaps again. If this didn\u2019t work, and you still see gaps, you will need to replace the seal."

Replacing the Refrigerator Door Seal Remove the gasket from the refrigerator door. Grab the bottom of it on the inside, and pull the gasket back. You want to be able to see the metal gasket retainer.
