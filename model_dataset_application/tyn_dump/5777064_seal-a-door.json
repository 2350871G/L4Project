Some drafts are caused by the door shifting due to loose hinges. Because of this, before you seal the edges of your door, take a few minutes to tighten all of the hardware. If the hinge screws spin but won't tighten, it means that the wood in the hole is stripped out. You will need to replace the screws with wider or longer screws so that they can dig into wood that is not damaged. You may also need to fill the holes with wood plugs and re-drive the new screws into those plugs if there is a lot of wood damage.Tip: Similarly, if the doorknob itself moves when you lift it, you should tighten or replace it."

Drag the edge of a paint scraper along the top, bottom, and sides of the door and door frame to remove any stuck-on debris from these surfaces. Also clean the threshold, which is the bottom of the door frame. If there are grooves along the threshold, run a nail through the grooves to scrape away any gunk that has gotten lodged in there.

          "description":"There are several different types of weather stripping available, so you'll need to decide which one you wish to use. For the top and sides of your door, wrapped foam weather stripping is durable and works well with gaps of various sizes. Weather stripping with a wooden shell is durable yet easier to work with than metal weather stripping, so it makes a good choice for someone who has no prior experience sealing doors. For the door sweep, consider using a metal door sweep with a flexible vinyl flap for greater durability. A metal door sweep with a flexible vinyl flap is also fairly easy to install, as the metal piece is screwed down and then the vinyl is inserted into it. More advanced options include storm-proof seals and roller door seals, such as brush or auto-lift vinyl seals that attach to the bottom of roller doors. If purchasing a weather stripping kit, note that most kits only contain weatherstripping for the top and sides of your door. You will need to purchase a separate door sweep. Rigid door sweeps will not work if the carpet is higher or even with the threshold. When rigid door sweeps won't work, use flexible bulb weather stripping made of vinyl. This attaches to the threshold right under the door."

To achieve a tight seal, you will need to measure cut pieces of weather stripping that are tailor fit to each side, which means that you will need to know the precise length of each side.Tip: You should measure both sides separately.

You do not need to angle the bottom end of your side pieces. The foam and vinyl portions can be cut using sharp scissors, but you will need a hacksaw or similar tool to cut any metal or wood portions.

You can use a metal file, sandpaper, or sanding belt to fine-tune these top angles. Make small adjustments and check the fit until you reach the proper angle.
