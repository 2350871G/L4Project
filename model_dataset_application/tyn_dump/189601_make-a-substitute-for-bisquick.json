  "text":" Mixing Bisquick by Hand Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Sift 6 cups (600 g) of all-purpose flour into a large bowl.

Cut 1 cup (225 g) of vegetable shortening into \u20442 in (1.3 cm) cubes, and add it to the flour mixture. You can use cold butter or coconut oil instead of shortening. Cut the shortening into the mixture using a pastry blender. Set a pastry blender into the bowl and rock it side-to-side, then lift it up. Repeat this motion several times, as fluidly as you can, until the mixture resembles fine crumbs or cornmeal. Alternatively, hold a knife in each hand, so that they make an X. Set them into the bowl, then slide them past each other, repeatedly, changing directions often. Store the mixture in an airtight container, in a cool, dark place. If you used shortening or coconut oil, you can store the Bisquick in a cool, dark cabinet. If you made the Bisquick from butter, however, you'll have to keep it in the fridge, or it will go rancid. A glass jar would be the best, but you can use a plastic container too. Use the Bisquick within 3 months. You can use this for just about any Bisquick recipes, such as Bisquick biscuits or Bisquick pancakes. You can also use it in any other recipe that calls for Bisquick.
