      "description":"This is the most common method used by home bakers. Add the yeast to a bowl with a little sugar. Add a little warm water. Leave the mixture to prove for a few minutes. Add the yeast mixture to the other ingredients and knead, rise, and bake as directed."

      "headline":"Use the quick-mix method.",
      "description":"This fast method is suitable for yeast breads apart from those that will sit overnight or soured loaves. It can only be used with granulated freeze-dried yeast. Place the granulated dried yeast into the flour with all other ingredients, including the liquid, at the same time. Ensure that the temperature of the liquid is a little higher, as this will help to both dissolve the yeast and distribute it through the dough."

      "headline":"Make a yeast sponge.",
      "description":"This method is useful for giving the dough a stronger, more sour flavor. It works as follows:\nDissolve the yeast in a little warm water. Add enough flour to it to make a sponge. Leave the yeast sponge to prove over several hours. It can even be left overnight. Add the other ingredients and knead the dough. Leave to rise as usual."
