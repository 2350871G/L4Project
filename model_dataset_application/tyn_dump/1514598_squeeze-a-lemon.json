Using a sharp knife, cut the lemon halfway down the middle, so that when you open it the inside looks like a pie cut into slices. To protect your countertop, place a cutting board down beneath your lemon before you slice it. Some people prefer to slice their lemon lengthwise, or pointed end to pointed end, when juicing it by hand. You can do this instead if you prefer."

          "description":"Take half the lemon in the palm of your hand with the cut side facing up. If you turn the lemon with the cut facing down, the seeds will run out when you squeeze into your bowl. Holding the cut facing up allows most of the seeds to stay inside the lemon instead of getting into your bowl. A few seeds may fall down into your bowl even if you hold the lemon with the cut facing up. Just remove the seeds from your bowl with your fingers or a spoon when you\u2019re finished juicing."

Squeeze at least 3 times, or more if you think there is still more juice in the lemon. Lemon juice may sting your hands if you have any open cuts or scratches on them. For the best results, wear thin rubber cooking gloves while squeezing your lemon. Repeat the squeezing steps with your other lemon half."

The remaining juice will come out of the pulp as you crush it with the spoon. To avoid getting seeds in your bowl, take the seeds out of your lemon half with your fingers before starting to press the lemon with your spoon."

Many people place the lemon into the press the other way, with the cut-side down against the point of the press.
