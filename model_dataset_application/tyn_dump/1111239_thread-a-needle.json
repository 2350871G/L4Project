Push the thread slowly and surely through the eye-hole until you see it poke through the other side. Try holding the needle sideways, so that you can't see the eye, but you can see the thread as soon as it peeks through the eye. This may take a couple of attempts. Keep trying! If you're having trouble, try moistening and smoothing the tip of the thread again. If you keep trying, but you can't get it, consider using a needle with a bigger eye-hole."
