Grasp both sides of the frame and lift the door up off of its tracks. Place the screen doors safely off to the side until you are ready to put them back. When handling large and heavy doors, it is always a good idea to have someone help you. The other person can hold the doors steady while you lift the rollers off the track."

Some plates may be screwed in; you will need to remove the screws before taking the plate out. Others can simply be lifted up. If you cannot find this plate, your door may not have one. You can use a drill instead of a screwdriver if you have one. To remove screws, set the drill to reverse."

Turn the screws counterclockwise until you can pull them from the headstop. Once all of the screws are removed, the headstop should come down. Some doors may have brackets instead of a strip at the top of the door. In this case, remove the brackets by undoing the screws and taking the bracket off the wall. Have another person hold onto the door once you remove the headstop. Without the headstop, the door may fall over and break."

Use a Phillips head screwdriver to turn the screw counterclockwise as far as it will go. This will raise the rollers up into the door, making it easier to remove the door from the track. If you only see 1 screw, it will be the adjustment screw. The adjustment screw is usually the same color as the rollers whereas other screws may be a different color."
