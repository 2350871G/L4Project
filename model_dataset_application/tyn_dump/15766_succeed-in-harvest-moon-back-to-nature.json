    "This is a quick list of things you need and where to get them",
    "PB#1: Pick up your axe and try to cut down the tree on Mother's hill (where there are many flowers). The tree begins to talk! You have the option to keep chopping or stopping. stop chopping. you will get a power berry",
    "PB #2: In the mine next to the waterfall, keep mining (with your hoe)and you should encounter a Power berry",
    "PB #3: The winter mine (when the lake freezes) also holds a power berry",
    "PB #4: Win the Summer Swimming Festival (Tap Triangle and X Alternately as fast as you can. SAVE before attempting!)",
    "PB #5: Throw five eggs (One per day) into the waterfall. Stand in the entrance to the mine, aim carefully, and throw. The Harvest Goddess should appear and thank you for your offering. Do this for five days and she will reward you with a Power Berry",
    "PB #6: Over the frozen lake, go behind and to the left of the mine. Press X and walk around (against the wall you cannot see) and you will eventually find one",
    "PB #7: Purchase every kitchen utensil over the shopping network. The last item should be a power berry for 5000 G.",
    "PB #8: In the horse race, you have to win 1001 Medals. You can do this in the beginning by betting on the winning horse, or more simply, care for and train your own horse. Brush your horse everyday and ride him everyday too. When the time comes for the horse race, race with your horse and bet on yourself.",
    "PB #9: In the beach (to the left of the Town Square) there is a dock where Greg the Fisherman fishes (you also get the rod from there). Keep fishing in the ocean and you will eventually turn up a power berry.(easiest in winter)",
    "PB #10: When you mine in the winter mine, go as deep as you can and eventually there is a cave in the north! In this place, you can start fishing and you will come up with a power berry.",
    "Plant 90 flowers, or 10 full fields (any kind, but try not to use the magic red flowers because there is a rare type of flower that appears when you plant many of these). Then, Anna comes to your farm and you can tell her to pick as many as she wants. She gives you a power berry in return, of course.",
    "Special PB: In the spring, grow cucumbers. Put three in your fridge or if you do not have one, put it into your rucksack. When it rains during spring, go up to the lake and stand near the two trees next to each other. Throw one in and this mysterious green creature comes up. Keep throwing them in and he will eventually give you a power berry.",
    "The Beehive: The beehive will produce honey everyday (Including the bottle, somehow.) To get the beehive, plant one field of flowers. When they bloom, bees should gather in your farm. In order to maximize profits, take one bottle to Luis, the bee expert. He will sample your honey and tell you that it is a special type of honey and you can get more money for it.",
    "Livestock",
    "Wine (to get with Karen): Buy from the winery, but make sure you use the morning part of your day because it is open from 9-12.",
    "Truffle: In the mountain, next to the lake. There is a long stemmed mushroom which yields an amazing profit.",
    "Gold Items: Win their respective festivals (Example: Gold eggs: Chicken festival.)"
