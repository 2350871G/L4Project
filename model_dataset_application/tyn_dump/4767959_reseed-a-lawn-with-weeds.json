  "text":" Testing Your Lawn and Getting the Right Seed Dig up samples of your lawn\u2019s soil. Use a spade to dig 6 inches (15 cm) into the ground in 3 different spots on your lawn. Separate the dirt from rocks and grass and scoop them into a container. Send samples of your soil to a local extension office or garden center. Call a local garden center or extension office and ask them if they can test your soil for nutrient deficiencies and pH level.

If you are planting warm-season grass, you should plant the seed in late-spring or mid-summer. Performing Spot Weeding and Seeding Dig up roots with a spade or deweeding tool. Hold the spade or deweeding tool 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the base of the weed. Angle your tool downward towards the center of the weed, trying not to sever any of the roots. Push down on the handle of your tool to uproot the weed. Remove any remaining weed roots. Severed roots will cause new weeds to sprout. Dig up any weed stems that you see and discard them in a garbage bag along with the weeds. Sprinkle moist compost over the spot that you pulled. Use a soil-based compost that\u2019s high in organic material to promote the growth of new grass. Lay down 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of compost. Scatter grass seeds over the compost. Lay down a handful of seeds over the compost. The seeds should cover the area in a thin layer. The seeds should not pile up. If the compost you used was moist, you don\u2019t need to water the seeds anymore. Cover the compost with fleece. Horticultural fleece or nets can be purchased at gardening stores or online. This will prevent animals like squirrels or birds from eating the grass seed before it has time to germinate. Lay the fleece over the area where you laid compost and grass seed. Secure the fleece with wooden stakes. Use small wooden stakes, nails, or branches to secure the fleece in all 4 corners. This should keep the grass seed covered. Remove the fleece after a week or 2. Warm-season grass could take up to 24 days to germinate. Cool-season grass will typically germinate in under 2 weeks. Once the grass seed starts to sprout into grass, you can remove the fleece and allow the grass to mature. It may take several weeks for the spot to fully fill in. Weed the lawn once the grass has grown 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm). There still may be weed seeds around the area. Once the grass has grown a little, you should watch for any new weeds.
