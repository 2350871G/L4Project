To gauge how bad the problem is, go around the entire window frame applying pressure to the wood every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) with your fingertip or a small tool like an awl or screwdriver. If you feel it give, it most likely means that there\u2019s rot in that section. Wood rot is often accompanied by peeling, wrinkled, or discolored paint. Be sure to touch-test the entire surface of each piece. Otherwise, you may miss a spot.Tip: It\u2019s best to use epoxy when the piece you\u2019re repairing is still 80-85% intact, or when it would be especially costly or difficult to try to replace the piece with new wood."

          "description":"Dig the tip of your tool into the bad wood and work it free of the frame. You shouldn\u2019t encounter too much resistance since the decay will have made it soft. However, you\u2019ll still want to work carefully to avoid damaging the surrounding wood. Continue gouging and scraping until only hard, healthy wood remains. Take your time and focus on eliminating as much of the rotted wood as you can. If you leave any behind, it could easily spread to another part of the frame. If you discover that the rot is more extensive than you originally thought, you may have no choice but to cut replacement pieces to install in the sections that can\u2019t be salvaged."

          "description":"Most epoxies consist of two separate bonding components that need to be combined in equal parts in order to be effective. Follow the mixing instructions listed on the packaging to prepare enough epoxy to patch each individual spot you uncovered while probing. Make sure you pick up a wood filler epoxy that's designed specifically for use on wood surfaces. If possible, do your mixing on a surface that the epoxy won\u2019t stick to, such as a sheet of plexiglass, plastic tarp, or freezer bag, or the shiny side of a strip of packing tape."

After building up each spot, glide the flat side of your putty knife over the epoxy a few times as though you were frosting a cake. This will help produce a smoother finish that you can hide easily with a couple coats of paint. Some two-part epoxy kits are sold with applicator guns that make it possible to mix and apply the filler simultaneously. Keep in mind that you'll still need to use a putty knife to spread the epoxy even if you're using a gun to apply it. It\u2019s better to use too much epoxy than too little. Partially-filled holes and crevices could result in unsightly dents and depressions once the area has been repainted. You\u2019ll only have about 30-60 minutes from the time that you mix up your epoxy before it begins to dry, so make an effort to work quickly and efficiently.

Don\u2019t forget to miter the ends of decorative moulding to a 45-degree angle. Shop around for wood with a similar thickness and grain pattern to that of the window\u2019s original components. If you\u2019re not sure what type of wood was used to construct your home, take a photo or sample piece from a healthy, intact section of the window down to your local home improvement center to have it examined by a professional.

For especially large windows, space additional nails 16 inches (41 cm) apart along the length in pairs to make sure your new pieces hold.

Plan on applying at least 2 coats to achieve full coverage on unfinished wood. If you\u2019re making improvements to an older home and have no way of identifying the exact shade of paint used, just try to match it as best you can. A set of paint chips or color-matching app can help you with your comparison. Another option is to simply repaint all of the window trim.
