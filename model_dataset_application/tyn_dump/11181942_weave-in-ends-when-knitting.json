          "description":"Tie off your last stitch and cut the tail about 5\u20136 in (13\u201315 cm) from the knot using a sharp pair of scissors. This will ensure that you have enough yarn to sew the tail into the edge of your work. If the tail is too short, then you won\u2019t be able to sew it into the edge and you\u2019ll need to use a different option."

          "description":"Insert the end of the tail into the eye of a tapestry or yarn needle. Then, pull about 2 in (5.1 cm) of the yarn through the needle and grip the needle with your thumb and index finger around the eye to keep the yarn from slipping out while you sew. Make sure to choose a needle with a big enough eye to thread your yarn through. You can purchase a yarn needle or tapestry needle in a craft supply store. Tip: Wet the end of the yarn with saliva or a few drops of water. This will help to stiffen the yarn and make it easier to thread through the eye of the needle."

Then, push the needle into this stitch so that it comes out on the other side of your work. Pull the needle all the way through the stitch until the yarn is through it completely.

Cut the yarn as close to the edge of the knitting project as you can without cutting through a stitch.
