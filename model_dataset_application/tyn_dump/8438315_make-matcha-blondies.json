Cut a large sheet of parchment paper and place it in the greased pan. You may need to cut slits in the corners so the paper fits snugly. Set the pan aside while you make the matcha blondies. If you don't want to use cooking spray, you can spread butter inside the pan and sprinkle flour over it. Shake the pan so the flour lightly coats the pan and dump out the excess flour."
