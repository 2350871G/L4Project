          "description":"Grab a garden hose with a nozzle attachment. Spray your bricks down with a firm stream of water. Let the bricks air dry for 6-12 hours. Then, get some rubber gloves and a thick-bristled brush. Fill a bucket with 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of bleach. Put on rubber gloves and scrub the brick with the bleach and water before rinsing it off. Work in 3 by 3 ft (0.91 by 0.91 m) sections until you\u2019ve scrubbed every portion of your brick.Variation: You can use muriatic acid instead of bleach if your bricks are especially filthy. If you do this, use a paint brush instead of a hard-bristled brush. Let the acid and water soak into the bricks for 4-5 minutes before rinsing it off. Be sure to wear long sleeves, rubber gloves, and protective eyewear when working with muriatic acid. Do this when the temperature is 45\u201355 \u00b0F (7\u201313 \u00b0C) for the best results. Cleaning your bricks once a year will remove dirt and residue from the pores in the bricks. This will keep the pores in the brick clear which will make it easier for your bricks to dry out when they get wet."

If they aren\u2019t, purchase a downspout extension from a construction supply store and tape or screw it into your current downspout to redirect water away from the bricks.If water is pooling up around the base of your building, it can get trapped in the bricks and weaken them over time.

If the gutters are leaking, use silicone sealant to fill in gaps in the gutters once the rain stops. If the gutter is sagging, use gutter spikes to nail the gutters at an angle where water will flow evenly towards the downspout.If the water is pouring out of your gutters into one location on your bricks, it can build up over time and soak into the grout.

Purchase a waterproof coating designed specifically for masonry from a construction supply store. You need 1 US gal (3.8 L) of coating for every 125 sq ft (11.6 m) of brick, so pick up as many gallons as you think you\u2019ll need based on bricks you plan on waterproofing.Variation: If your brick is newer, it probably has a water-resistant veneer mixed into it. If your brick is less than 10 years old, get a water-repellent coating instead of a waterproof coating. These bricks typically benefit from a little air and waterproof coating may seal moisture into newer bricks. You can measure the length and height of each brick surface and multiply it to determine how many gallons you need if you\u2019d like. You don\u2019t need to subtract for doors or windows if you\u2019re waterproofing walls, since it\u2019s a good idea to have some extra coating left over.
