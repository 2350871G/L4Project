The area you use to turn the project right side out will be the area you will ladder stitch. Smooth out the project. You may need to pop the corners out with a sewing needle through the entry point. You may also need to stuff the inside of the project before sewing up this last part of the hem. Fold the hem of the opening inward. You want it to match the seam allowance on both sides of the stitch. If it doesn\u2019t stay turned inward very easily, you can iron the open section so that it will lay flat while it is turned in.
