You should also place the coconut oil in a dark place in your kitchen or pantry so it's not exposed to sunlight. Avoid storing the coconut oil in reactive metal containers since these may add an undesirable flavor to the coconut oil."

Try to find a storage space that's below 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C) to prevent the oil from melting. It's common for coconut oil to melt since it has such a low melting point. Don't worry; this won't damage the oil. For example, avoid storing the oil in the bathroom even if you'll be using the coconut oil for beauty products. Bathroom temperature can fluctuate and introduce moisture into the oil. You should also avoid storing the oil in the attic or garage."

Chill the coconut oil until it's the texture you want. You can store the coconut oil in the refrigerator all the time, but it will become completely solid."

Don't worry if you got home from the store to find that the jar of coconut oil melted on the way. You could stick it in the fridge until it firms up a little and then store it in the pantry."

Ensure that the lid is pressed down or screwed on tight to prevent oxygen from spoiling the oil. If it takes you a long time to finish a bottle or tub of coconut oil, consider transferring the oil to a smaller container once you've used about half of it.

You can also stir melted coconut oil into mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes. Avoid leaving the coconut oil out next to the stove while you cook. The heat from the stove could melt the oil.

You can also use coconut oil instead of lotion to moisturize dry skin. If you use coconut oil every day for beauty products, you may want to transfer some oil into a small container. You can store the smaller container in the bathroom if you know you'll be using the oil quickly (within a week). Consider mixing coconut oil in with essential oils to create lip balms or salves."

For example, you can fry chicken strips, french fries, or fish. You can cool and reuse the coconut oil for frying. Discard the oil after using it a few times. Remember to move the coconut oil container away from the skillet of hot oil or it may melt the rest of your coconut oil."
