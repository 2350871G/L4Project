  "text":" Removing the Wings Place your cooked duck on a clean and stable cutting board. The breast side of the duck should be facing up. Use a carving fork to pierce the breast of the duck in order to stabilize it for cutting. Allow your duck to cool for 20 to 25 minutes after pulling it from the oven before you begin carving it. Carving your duck immediately will cause the moisture to drain, leaving your duck dry and chewy. Cut off the duck\u2019s wing with a sharpened knife. Slice into the skin and meat of the duck where the wing\u2019s joint connects to the duck\u2019s side. Push the knife completely into the initial cut. Pull the wing away from the duck\u2019s body until the joint is released. This may be difficult at first so be sure to grip the wing firmly and pull until the joint pops out of the socket. Remove the wing. Turn to the duck\u2019s other side. Cut and remove the duck\u2019s second wing. Carving the Legs Cut the skin between the leg and breast. Slice through the duck\u2019s fat and skin surrounding the leg, revealing the meat. Locate with your knife point the hip joint connecting the leg to the breast. Push your knife point into the hip joint to release. Use your non-dominant hand to hold onto the drumstick firmly. With your dominant hand, use your knife point to break the joint by applying pressure. After the leg is removed, be sure to also carve out the oval-shaped piece of meat near the exposed joint. Pull the leg away from the duck\u2019s hip to remove. The fatty skin of the duck can create some resistance while carving.

Slice and remove the duck\u2019s second leg. Cutting the Breast Meat Slice into the middle of your duck along one half of the breast. Run your cut from the top of your bird near the duck\u2019s neck to the bottom. Cut in long strokes to create lengthy slices of breast meat. After you cut away all the breast meat on one half, repeat this step on the other side of the duck\u2019s breast until you have completely removed the breast meat.
