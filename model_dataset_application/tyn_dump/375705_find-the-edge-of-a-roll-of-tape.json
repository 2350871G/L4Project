If you think you've identified the edge by looking closely, use your finger for a closer inspection. If you have very short fingernails, try running the edge of a knife around the rim of the roll. You might also use a toothpick, a paperclip, a key \u2013 anything that allows you the sensation and precision to feel a slight ridge in the surface of the tape.
