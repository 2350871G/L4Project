If you don't have jumbo yarn, try holding 3 strands of super bulky yarn together and knitting with those."

  "text":" Creating the Foundation Circle Choose a jumbo sized yarn and a US size Q (15 mm) crochet hook. Using jumbo sized yarn will help to give your basket its structure.

Working the Bottom of the Basket Chain 2. Wrap the yarn around the crochet hook, then pull this through the other loop on the hook. Loop the yarn over the hook and pull it through the other loop on the hook again to make the second chain. Make sure that you begin each round this way. Single crochet 2 times into every stitch in the round. For round 2, you will be doubling the total number of stitches. Insert your crochet hook into the first stitch in the round and work a single crochet stitch into it. Then, work a second single crochet stitch into the same stitch. Repeat this for each stitch in the round. Slipstitch to connect the round. Insert the hook into the first stitch in the round, yarn over, and pull through. This will connect the first and last stitches and complete the second round. Connecting the first and last stitches is important to get an even, circular base for your basket. Work additional increase rounds to expand the base of the basket. You can make the basket as big as you want it to be.

Building up the Sides of the Basket Single crochet 1 into all stitches in the round to build up the sides. Once you are satisfied with the size of the basket base, you can begin building up the sides of the basket. Single crochet 1 time into each of the stitches in the round. This will start to create height going up from the circular base you have created. Keep working rounds until the basket is the desired height. For a short basket, you might work only 3 or 4 rounds.
