          "description":"If you're not using instant yeast, put 2 teaspoons (6 g) of active dry yeast into a small bowl. Add a pinch of sugar and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the lukewarm water. Stir until the yeast is dissolved and let it sit for 5 minutes at room temperature. The yeast should bubble and foam up once it's activated.

Add 3 cups (361 g) of unbleached all-purpose flour to the bowl along with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil, 1 1/4 teaspoons (7 g) of salt, and \u20448 cup (210 ml) of lukewarm water. Avoid putting the salt directly onto the instant yeast because it will kill the yeast. You can add the remaining water later if the dough looks dry, but start with the smaller amount."

If the dough seems too dry, you can stir in the remaining \u20444 cup (59 ml) of lukewarm water, a spoonful at a time. If you're using a stand mixer, use the dough hook attachment. Don't use a hand mixer to make this dough because it's not powerful enough to mix the dough."

Use the palms of your hand to push the dough away from you so it stretches. Then turn the dough 45 degrees and fold it in half. Push the dough away again and continue to turn and fold the dough. Knead until the dough becomes soft and elastic. To knead the dough using a stand mixer, choose the second lowest speed and beat the dough for 4 to 5 minutes. To knead the dough using a bread machine, set the machine to run a dough cycle."
