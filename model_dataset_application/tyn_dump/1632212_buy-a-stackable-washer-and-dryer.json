If you cannot find a stackable unit that you can reach, consider getting a small stool to help you reach into the dryer."

The price will be higher than models with a thermostat sensor, which will measure air temperature in the drum of the dryer. However, the moisture sensor will save energy and help protect your laundry from extra wear and tear."

If you like to do a lot of small loads of laundry, make sure you select a model that has low settings as well as high or heavy-load settings. Other considerations that depend on your preference include the placement of the lint screen in the dryer, the buzzer or bell that alerts you that the drying is complete, the simplicity of adding detergent and bleach to the washer, and how noisy the machine is when it is running."
