Loppers, which are used to cut thicker branches that are higher up. Pole pruners, which cut even thicker branches. A pruning saw, for the thickest branches you need to cut."

Some gardeners prune in the fall, but this can remove the year\u2019s new growth as a buffer against winter damage. Crepe myrtles grow flower buds on new growth, so you should still get blossoms as long as you leave enough time in the growing season. If leaves haven\u2019t yet or have just barely appeared, it should be safe to prune your plant. It\u2019s possible to prune as late or even later than May without harming the tree. However, pruning this late will probably delay your bloom time. Pruning before leaves sprout on the tree is also helpful because you get a clearer view of which branches to cut. Keep in mind that you can remove flowers when they fade in the summer to encourage a second bloom, as well."

          "description":"To keep a crepe myrtle healthy and beautiful, you want to prune with an eye toward opening up the middle of the tree to allow air to flow through more easily. Don't over-prune by lopping the trunks close to the ground. Aside from those guidelines, you can prune your crepe myrtle to a shape and size that works for your yard. Crepe myrtles can grow about 1 to 2 feet (30-40 cm) per season, so prune based on your desired tree height. For example, if you want your tree to be about 6 feet (2 m) tall, you will want to prune back to 4 to 5 feet (121 cm to 166 cm). Keep in mind that new growth will sprout from the pruned areas."
