  "text":" Cutting Classic Fries Rinse and peel the potatoes. For classic french fries, scrub russet potatoes under cold water and then remove the peels. To make them easier to handle, you can pat the potatoes dry with a towel before you put them on a cutting board. Cut away eyes or rotten parts from the potato. Cut each potato into \u20444 to \u20444 inch (0.64 to 1.91 cm) slices. Trim off a sliver from the bottom of a potato and set the flat part of the potato on your cutting board. Then, use a sharp knife to carefully cut \u20444 to \u20444 inch (0.64 to 1.91 cm) slices lengthwise. You'll now have several potato planks on your cutting board. Stack the potato slices and cut them into \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) wide strips. Lay 2 to 3 slices of potato on top of each other and line them up. Then, slice the stack into \u20444 to \u20448 inch (0.64 to 0.95 cm) slices. Repeat this with all of the potato stacks. Try to make the slices as even as possible so your fries cook at the same rate. Cook the classic fries until they're crispy. Once you've cut the fries, you can fry them in a skillet or deep fryer. If you prefer, spread them on a baking sheet and bake them until they're browned. You can also make crispy french fries using an air fryer. Using a Mandoline to Cut Shoestring Fries Adjust the mandoline to the very fine julienne setting. Place the mandolin on a flat surface and follow the owner's manual to adjust the setting. You may need to insert an extra blade to julienne the potatoes or raise a knob to adjust the blade for very fine julienne. Your owner's manual may also recommend that you wet the surface of the mandoline with a few drops of water. This can help the potatoes slide across the blade easier. Always use extreme caution when working with the mandoline, since it's easy to accidentally cut yourself on its sharp blade. Push a potato onto the safeguard. Ensure that the rinsed potato is firmly in place and doesn't wiggle. If you'd like your shoestring fries without their skins, peel the potato before you put it on the safeguard.Variation: If you don't have a mandoline but want to make shoestring fries, try grating the potatoes against the coarse side of a box grater.

Rub it down the board so the julienne blade slices the potato into shoestrings. Keep going back and forth until all of the potato is cut. Soak the shoestring potatoes until you're ready to fry them. Put the cut potatoes into a bowl of ice water and let them soak for 10 minutes to remove excess starch. Then, drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry.
