Let the paint dry completely; this should take only 15 to 20 minutes. If the rock shows through the paint, add a second coat and let it dry too. Keep adding thin coats of paint and letting them dry until the rock is covered. Use spray paint instead if you are in a hurry, or if you want to make lots of rocks. Choose a bright, cheerful color, such as yellow, red, green, or sky blue. Avoid dark colors, such as black or dark red, as they are not happy colors.
