Pull firmly at the very base of each basil leaf to separate the bottom of the leaf itself from the central stem. If you pull on the leaves from their center, you\u2019ll end up tearing the basil leaves in half. Once the basil leaves are off the stem, throw it away."

Rinsing the herbs removes any grit or debris that had been stuck to the leaves."

Resting the weight of your hands on the towel will be enough to dry the basil. If you push down hard on the leaves, you\u2019ll crush the basil."
