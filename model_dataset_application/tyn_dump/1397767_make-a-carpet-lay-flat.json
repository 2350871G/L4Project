If that isn\u2019t possible, choose an area within your home that has adequate floor space and receives direct sunlight. Adjust your thermostat to keep the temperature between 70 and 85 degrees F.

    "Only this time, don\u2019t press the carpet down into the tack strip once you finish with that.",
    "Instead, use a lever-activated stretcher to pull the carpet even tauter toward the wall before securing it in place.",
    "The principle of a lever stretcher is the same.",
    "The only difference is in its operation.",
    "With these, you pump a lever up and down instead of using your knee.",
    "These are also a good alternative if you have a very large project or prior knee injuries.",
    "The repeated force of impact when using a knee kicker extensively can lead to physical trauma.",
    "Getting Rid of Bubbles in Installed Carpet Load a syringe with glue.",
    "First, purchase a container of carpet seam sealer large enough to address the amount of floor area in question.",
    "Additionally, pick up a food syringe.",
    "Remove the sealer\u2019s cap and draw an adequate amount into your syringe.",
    "Puncture the carpet.",
    "First, locate the bubble.",
    "Feel with your fingers to estimate its circumference.",
    "Once you have an idea of where its edges are, grip its center with a pair of pliers.",
    "Then puncture the center with the syringe\u2019s needle.",
    "Inject glue along the edges.",
    "Continue lifting the bubble up by its center with the pliers.",
    "As you do, angle the syringe\u2019s needle toward the edge of the bubble.",
    "Push the needle farther in as needed in order to reach the edge.",
    "Then push down on the syringe\u2019s plunger to line the subfloor with glue along the bubble\u2019s edge.",
    "Rotate the syringe as you work in order to apply a circular line of glue.",
    "Work your way inward.",
    "Continue applying glue in the same fashion.",
    "As you do, start drawing the needle out of the carpet.",
    "Create concentric circles of glue underneath the carpet spiraling in toward the center of the bubble.",
    "Press into place.",
    "Once you have drawn the needle all the way out, set the syringe aside.",
    "Starting from the center of the bubble, use your hands to push the edge into the subfloor.",
    "Ensure the glue makes contact with the carpet\u2019s underside while spreading it out at the same time for wider contact.",
    "From there, continue outward toward the bubble\u2019s edges.",
    "Reinforce contact while the glue dries.",
    "Use a rolling pin to smooth the carpet even further once you\u2019ve finished pressing the bubble down into place with your hands.",
    "Then set weights over the area to keep the glue in contact with the carpet until it sets.",
    "Check the glue\u2019s instructions regarding drying times.",
    "Leave the weights in place for at least that long."
