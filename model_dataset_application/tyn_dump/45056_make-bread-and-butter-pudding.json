  "text":" Making Basic Bread and Butter Pudding Lightly grease the inside of a 2-pint (1 litre) baking dish with butter. If you'd like, you can sprinkle caster or superfine sugar inside the baking dish when you are done. Prepare the bread slices. Cut the crusts off of the bread first, then spread the softened butter over one side of each slice. Cut each slice twice of bread to make four triangles. Place a single layer of bread slices, buttered-side-up in the bottom of the dish. Do not overlap or squish the bread slices together. You will have lots of bread left over, which you will be using for other layers. Spread a layer of sultanas across the bread, then sprinkle them with some cinnamon. If you do not like sultanas, or can't find any, you can use another type of dried fruit, such as raisins. Repeat the bread, sultana, and cinnamon layers until you have no more slices of bread left.

This gives the bread enough time to soak up the custard, and for the different flavors to blend together. Bake the pudding in a preheated oven at 355\u00b0F (180\u00b0C), for 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat your oven to 355\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) first. Then, place the pudding into the oven, and let it bake for 30 to 40 minutes. The pudding is ready when the custard thickens and the top turns a golden-brown color. Let the pudding cool for a few minutes before serving it. Once the pudding is done, use potholders to take the baking dish out of the oven. Set the dish down on a heat-safe surface, and wait a few minutes for the pudding to cool. Making Deluxe Bread and Butter Pudding Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C), and prepare your baking dish. Make sure that the baking rack is in the middle of the oven. Lightly coat the inside of a 9 by 13 by 2-inch (22.86 by 33.02 by 5.08 centimeters) baking dish with butter. Prepare the bread. Cut the soft rolls into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick slices. Then, use a butter knife to spread the butter onto one side of each bread slice. You can choose any type of small, soft, round roll. Brioche is a great choice. Place the bread slices, buttered-side-up, on the bottom of your baking dish. Arrange the slices in neat layers, one on top of the other. You will end up with several layers of bread. Make sure that you are setting the slices buttered-side-up in each layer. Sprinkle the top of the bread with raisins. If you don't like raisins, or can't find then, you can also use sultanas instead; they are very common in bread and butter puddings. Set the dish aside when you are done. Combine the milk, heavy cream, salt, and vanilla in a large saucepan. Pour the milk and heavy cream into the saucepan first, then stir them together. Stir in the salt next. Cut the vanilla beans open lengthwise, then use the tip of a knife to scrape the seeds into the saucepan. Stir everything together once more with a whisk. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium to high heat, then remove from the stove promptly. Stir the milk mixture often as it is coming to a boil to prevent scorching. Once the milk is boiling, take the saucepan off the heat, and turn off the stove. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl until the eggs turn pale yellow. Crack the eggs open into a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar. Beat the two together with a whisk until the yolks break and blend in with the whites. This will take about 1 minute.

Pouring a little bit of the hot milk into the eggs will allow the eggs to heat up slowly without cooking. This will give you a smoother custard base in the end. Slowly whisk in the rest of the milk mixture into the egg mixture, then strain the custard base. Once you have the custard base mixed together, pour it through a fine, mesh strainer into a large mixing bowl. Discard any lumps or clumps that get caught in the strainer. Pour the custard base into the baking dish. The bread will float to the top, so use a spatula or a spoon to press down on the bread until it soaks up the custard and sinks to the bottom.
