    "This will make them easier to close up.",
    "Turducken Variations\nIf you want to make a breakfast turducken, put a peeled, soft-boiled egg in the center.",
    "For a smoky flavor, cook your turducken on a grill or in a smoker.",
    "If you love bacon, you can wrap the entire turducken in it before roasting.",
    "If you like the sweet and spicy combination, rub a little brown sugar and hot sauce into the skin of the turkey along with the Creole seasoning.",
    "Roll the birds up and sew the turkey closed with butcher\u2019s twine.",
    "Start by rolling up the chicken, then roll the duck over it.",
    "Finally, bring the sides of the turkey together to meet in the middle.",
    "Use the trussing needle to sew the 2 sides together by weaving butcher\u2019s twine through both sides, starting at the tail and working your way up to the neck.",
    "Pull the twine as you sew to tighten it.",
    "Poke the needle with the twine into the right side of the turkey and pull it up through the skin on the left side.",
    "Then bring the twine back across and stick it through the right side, about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) up the turkey, to complete 1 stitch.",
    "You can buy butcher\u2019s twine and trussing needles from a chef shop, kitchen supply store, or online retailer.",
    "Keep your stitches about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge of the skin if you don\u2019t want them to tear through it.",
    "Use a skewer or toothpicks to hold the turkey skin in place while you sew it, or have a friend help hold the bird together.",
    "Set the turducken on a roasting rack and rub the skin with seasoning.",
    "Arrange the turducken in the pan so the breast of the bird is facing up.",
    "Use your hands to rub as much salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning into the skin of the turkey as you\u2019d like.For a 16 lb (7.3 kg) turkey, use a roasting pan that\u2019s at least 15.75 by 12 inches (40.0 by 30.5 cm).",
    "Choose a pan that\u2019s at least 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) deep, too, so any juices don\u2019t spill over the edges.",
    "If you want meat that\u2019s even more moist, brush the outside of the turkey with olive oil before rubbing in the spices.",
    "How to Make Your Own Creole Seasoning\nCombine the following ingredients:\n2 teaspoons (4.2 g) of paprika2 tablespoons (16.8 g) of garlic powder1 tablespoon (18 g) of salt1 tablespoon (6.9 g) of onion powder1 tablespoon (3 g) of dried oregano1 tablespoon (2.7 g) of dried thyme1 tablespoon (5.3 g) of cayenne pepper1 tablespoon (6.4 g) of black pepper Cover the roasting pan and place it in the oven.",
    "Covering the turducken prevents it from browning too quickly.",
    "Wrap a sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the pan so that the turducken is completely covered before putting it in the oven.The best spot for the turducken is the middle rack of the oven.",
    "This is where the most heat can circulate around the pan, so the turducken will cook evenly.",
    "Roast the turducken for 4 hours, then uncover it and cook it 1 more hour.",
    "After 4 hours are up, carefully remove the aluminum foil from the pan and return the turducken to the oven.",
    "Check it after another hour.",
    "The bird should be golden brown on the outside.To be sure that the turducken is fully cooked, insert a meat thermometer into the turkey thigh and check that it reads at least 180 \u00b0F (82 \u00b0C).",
    "You can also insert the thermometer all the way into the stuffing, which should be at least 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) once it\u2019s finished.",
    "Take the turducken out of the oven and let it sit for 1 hour.",
    "Letting the turducken rest will allow the birds to reabsorb their juices and will also firm up the meat so it\u2019s easier to carve.",
    "If you cut into it too early, you\u2019ll be left with dry meat.Don\u2019t let the turducken sit out at room temperature for longer than 2 hours or it will be unsafe to eat.",
    "If you won't be eating it within 2 hours, place the turducken in the refrigerator until you're ready for it.",
    "If you want to keep the turducken warm, cover the pan with aluminum foil while it rests.",
    "Remove the twine and place the turducken on a platter to carve it.",
    "After you pull out all of the twine, begin by cutting the turducken in half lengthwise from the tail to the neck.",
    "Then cut \u20444 in (1.9 cm) thick slices perpendicular to the center cut, resulting in pieces that show off all of the layers.To make it easier to carve, cut the 2 turkey legs and 2 wings off first.",
    "You can use the drippings in the bottom of the roasting pan to make gravy.",
    "Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 to 4 days.",
    "You can also freeze the leftovers for up to 6 months.",
    "Making Southern Cornbread Dressing Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).",
    "Do this about 20 to 30 minutes before you\u2019re ready to put the dressing in the oven, as that\u2019s how long it usually takes the oven to heat up.",
    "Make sure the oven is on the bake setting.If you want the oven to heat up faster, turn it to broil first.",
    "Then switch it back to the bake setting when you\u2019re ready to cook.",
    "Toss the cornbread and cubed white bread in a mixing bowl.",
    "Add the 6 cups (300 g) of crumbled cornbread and 5 slices of cubed, stale white bread into the bowl.",
    "Gently fold the 2 types of bread together.You can make your own cornbread or buy it premade from the grocery store.",
    "Wait until the cornbread is completely cooled before you crumble it if you made it yourself.",
    "If you don\u2019t have stale bread, you can make it in the oven.",
    "How to Make Stale Bread in the Oven\nPreheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).",
    "Cut your slices of bread into cubes and lay them out on a baking sheet.",
    "Place the sheet in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until the bread is browned and toasted.",
    "Saute the onion and celery with 4 tbsp (56.8 g) of butter in a skillet.",
    "Place the butter in the bottom of the pan and heat it so that the butter melts completely.",
    "Then add the 1 chopped onion and 1 cup (225 g) of diced celery, cooking the vegetables until they\u2019re soft.",
    "This should take about 6 to 8 minutes.The butter will melt faster if you cut it into thin slices before placing it in the skillet.",
    "Stir the vegetables with a spatula while they cook so they don\u2019t burn on the bottom of the pan.",
    "You can also add salt and pepper to the vegetables to taste.",
    "Melt 6 tablespoons (85.2 g) of butter and mix it with the broth and eggs.",
    "Use a whisk to beat the melted butter with 4 cups (950 ml) of chicken broth and 5 eggs in a separate mixing bowl.",
    "Blend the ingredients together thoroughly.You can melt the butter in the microwave or on the stove in a skillet.",
    "If you don\u2019t have chicken broth, you can substitute turkey broth.",
    "Add the veggies and the butter mixture into the bowl with the bread.",
    "Place the cooked celery and onion along with the liquid mixture into the bread bowl.",
    "Toss everything together until the ingredients are completely combined.If you want extra flavor, you can toss in chopped sage or parsley.",
    "Place the dressing in a greased 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) pan.",
    "Apply a thin coat of butter, shortening, or non-stick spray to the bottom of your pan.",
    "Then spread out the dressing so it fills the entire pan in an even layer.If you\u2019re using a non-stick pan, you don\u2019t need to grease it beforehand.",
    "To make cleanup easier, you can line the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil before putting the dressing in.",
    "If you do this, you also don\u2019t need to grease the pan.",
    "Set the pan in the oven and bake it for 45 minutes before removing it.",
    "To help the dressing cook evenly, place the pan on the middle rack of the oven, where the hot air can circulate around the entire dish.",
    "After 45 minutes, the dressing should be golden brown and slightly crisp on the top.",
    "Take it out of the oven.If you aren\u2019t using the dressing for the turducken right away, transfer it to an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3 to 4 days.",
    "Using the Turducken Drippings to Make Gravy Heat the turducken drippings, butter, and flour in a saucepan.",
    "Pour the drippings from the bottom of the roasting pan into the saucepan.",
    "Then add 1 tablespoon (14.2 g) of butter and 1 tablespoon (8 g) of flour and turn the stove to medium heat.",
    "Stir the mixture constantly, making sure all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.If you're having trouble blending the flour into the liquid, use a whisk instead of a spoon to break up large chunks.",
    "For a smoother gravy, strain the turducken drippings before you add them.",
    "Place a colander over the top of the pan and pour the drippings through it to catch any large bits.",
    "Stir in the whole milk and chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil.",
    "Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of whole milk and \u20442 cup (120 ml) of chicken stock into the saucepan, continuing to whisk the liquids together as you do so.",
    "Turn the heat on the stove up to high until the contents of the pan begin to boil.It may help to pour the liquids in gradually while you stir to make it easier to blend them.",
    "You can also substitute 1%, 2%, or skim milk for the whole milk.",
    "However, it will make your gravy thinner.",
    "Reduce the heat and let the gravy simmer for 10 minutes.",
    "Once your mixture begins boiling, turn the heat down to low or medium-low.",
    "Allow the gravy to simmer so that it thickens up to the right consistency, stirring it occasionally to prevent it from burning on the bottom of the pan.If you prefer a thinner gravy, you can add more chicken stock after the 10 minutes are up.",
    "If you want a thicker gravy, whisk in a little more flour.",
    "Use a kitchen timer or the clock app on your phone to monitor the time.",
    "Add salt and pepper to taste if you'd like.",
    "Remove the pan from the heat and let the gravy cool slightly.",
    "Before serving, allow the gravy to cool off for about 5 minutes.",
    "Take it off of the stove while it cools so the gravy at the bottom of the pan doesn't scorch.If you aren't using the gravy immediately, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months."
