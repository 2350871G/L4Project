Peel the used mesh off the frame after the acetone solvent has been used to clean the adhesive off.  Use 80-grit sandpaper to roughen up the areas of your frame that will be glued, if your frame is wooden. It helps overall adhesion by creating places on which the glue can easily attach and hold. Aluminum frames do not need to be sanded. Wipe the frame with a tack cloth.  Choose an adhesive. They are often identified by low and high viscosity, and what you need will depend on your mesh count. There are many trade grades of adhesive available for mesh counts from 110 to 355. Ask your printing supplier for recommendations. The right adhesive is essential to bond the fabric to the frame. Cut a new piece of mesh to size that is slightly bigger than the frame. Mesh is sold by the meter. Place the frame on wooden blocks in the middle of your screen stretching machine or device. The wooden blocks will increase the tension between the stretching device and the mesh. Place the mesh over the frame and insert it into the tension bars on your stretching device.
