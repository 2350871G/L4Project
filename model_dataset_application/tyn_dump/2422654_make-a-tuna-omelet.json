Once the oil is shimmering and covers the surface of the pan it's ready. You can also use a tbsp of butter. If you use butter, make sure not to let it burn or turn brown.

You can use tuna canned in oil or in water. Here are some things to consider:\nTuna can be a great source of Omega-3 fats, but to get the most out of your tuna, choose tuna packed in water. When tuna is packed in oil, the oil mixes with some of the tuna\u2019s natural fat, so when you drain oil-packed tuna, some of its Omega-3 fatty acids also go down the drain. Water packed tuna won't leech any of the Omega-3. Oil-packed tuna will give you a richer-tasting and more flavorful tuna right out of the can. Of course, you can add your own seasonings and oil to the tuna yourself and you won't have to miss out on any of the valuable Omega-3s."

Use a fork or egg whisk to beat your eggs in the bowl until combined and set the bowl aside. You can use the entire egg or just the egg whites. Here are some things to consider:\nWhole eggs, overall, are healthier for you. The more important consideration is where the eggs come from. Pasture-raised eggs from chickens that are roaming around eating plants and insects are the best choices. Look for organic eggs from hormone-free, cage-free chickens. If you are concerned about high-calorie counts and high cholesterol, combine whole eggs with egg whites to help keep important nutrients in the diet while cutting down on the fat and cholesterol. If you are looking to make an extra fluffy omelet, add a splash of milk to your egg mixture and whisk it in."
