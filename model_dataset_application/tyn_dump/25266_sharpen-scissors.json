Use full scissor strokes, beginning the cutting at the base of the scissors and extending to the tip. Cutting through sandpaper is good for scissors that aren\u2019t horribly dull, but just need some touch up sharpening. The sandpaper also helps smooth out nicks and indents on the blades. Some alternative cutting materials to sharpen scissors are emery cloth and steel wool."

Sharpening stones normally have two sides used for sharpening blades: a coarser, grainier side, and a fine side. If you have very dull scissors, you should start out using the coarse side of the stone, and then use the finer side of the stone to finish your sharpening.

You want to create a nice, sharp angle between the inner blade (the part you\u2019re currently sharpening), and the cutting edge (the top edge to the inner side of the blade). Where those two edges meet, is the area that needs to be sharp to cut things. Grip the handle of the scissor blade, and slowly pull the blade across the stone toward you, keeping the edge of the blade flat against the stone. Repeat this action slowly and carefully until the blade has been sharpened. This should take about 10-20 pulls. Repeat this step with the other blade of the scissors. You should practice on some old scissors until you fully get the hang of how to sharpen blades."

With the blade horizontal to you, slowly pull the blade across the stone toward you, keeping that beveled edge flat against the stone. Match the angle as closely as possible and continue to slide the blade forward. Repeat this action carefully until the blade is sharpened. If you started on the coarse side of the stone, finish with a few swipes on the finer side of the stone to give a nice, smooth finish. If you have never sharpened scissors this way before, you might find it difficult to judge when the edge of the blade is completely sharpened. Consider this trick: before you start sharpening the blades, run the tip of a permanent marker across the edge of the scissor blade. Start sharpening the blade, and when the marker line has been sanded away off the edge, you\u2019ve successfully sharpened the blade."

These burrs can easily be removed by putting the scissors backs together, and opening and closing them a few times. Then use the scissors to cut through some kind of material like paper, cardboard, or fabric. This will further ensure the little burrs get knocked off the blades.
