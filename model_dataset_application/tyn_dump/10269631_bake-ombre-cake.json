Stir the batter well in a large bowl so that there aren\u2019t any big lumps. If you\u2019d rather make your white cake mix from scratch, find a recipe online or in a cookbook.

          "description":"Your cake should have at least 3 layers so that the color change is evident in each layer, but you can choose however many you\u2019d like. How many layers you bake may depend on how many matching cake pans you have, as you\u2019ll want each layer to be the same size. If you have three cake pans that are all the same size, decide on a three-layered ombre cake. If you want 5 layers but only have 2 or 3 cake pans, you can always cook the cakes in separate batches in the oven."

Tinting the Batter Set one bowl of cake batter aside that will stay white. This bowl will be the lightest, top layer of the cake. Make sure no food coloring goes in this bowl by setting it to the side so it's ready to go straight into the baking pan. Add 1 drop of food coloring to the next bowl of cake batter. Pour a drop of your desired color of food coloring into a new bowl of batter. Use a very small amount, as this will be the second lightest batter color.
