Then allow the beans to soak for a minimum of eight hours or overnight. When you soak navy beans, enzymes inside the bean are broken down. This will decrease gas."

          "headline":"Simmer your beans until tender.",
          "description":"First you'll need to strain your beans from the cold water they've been soaking in. Then put the beans into a pot and cover them with six cups of hot water for every pound (.45 kg) of beans. Turn on your stove and bring the water to a boil and then simmer the beans for 1.5 to 2 hours. You can adjust the time you simmer your beans to adjust the tenderness of your beans. Shorter simmer times will yield firmer beans, longer times will result in more tender beans. While simmering, it's likely a foam will form on the top of your water. Add 1 - 2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil to the water to cut down on foam. Wait until the beans are completely cooked before adding any salt. Adding salt earlier interferes with the re-hydration process and can result in \"tough\" beans."
