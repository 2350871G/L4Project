Turn them over on the other side and press the meat into the spices again. If you are trying to limit how much spice gets on the riblets, sprinkle a spoonful of the spices on the top surface of the riblets evenly. Rub in these spices with the spoon or your hand.

Keep the rubbed, uncooked meat in the fridge while it sits.

Some recipes suggest that you should lightly score your riblets before you apply the dry rub. This means that you will very briefly cook the ribs over a very high heat. You will only cook each side of the riblet for a few seconds. Scoring seals in some of the juices in the meat."
