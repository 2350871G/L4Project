You also want to grab some unflavored vodka and a small amount of pineapple juice that you can splash in at the end. You need a half shot, or 3/4 of an ounce (22 ml), of each. The original liquid cocaine shot was also very fruity, containing these ingredients: triple sec, amaretto almond liqueur, peach liqueur, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, cranberry juice, and lemon-lime soda."
