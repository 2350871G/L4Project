The label tells you what temperature to set your washing machine and whether or not you should dry the jacket in the dryer.

Remember to check the pockets for loose items before you wash the jacket. Zipping or buttoning the jacket can also help it keep its shape while you wash it."

          "description":"If you notice a stain on the jacket, wet the fabric and rub liquid laundry detergent onto the stain until it suds. Set the jacket aside for 30 minutes so the detergent can break up the stain. Then, wash the jacket. If you wash the jacket before treating the stain, you may accidentally set the stain, which makes it harder to remove."

          "description":"Instead of tossing the jacket in and adding soap and water, put the soap into your machine and let it fill with water first. This allows the soap to dissolve so it won't leave permanent white stains on the linen fabric. If you have a front-loading washing machine, read the manual to determine if your machine has special care instructions for linen or if you should wash it by hand. You can use your favorite laundry detergent as long as it doesn't contain bleach, which can weaken the fibers. Fill the machine at least half full of water even if you're only washing 1 or 2 linen items. This allows the fabric to circulate in the machine."

          "description":"Once your machine is at least half full of soapy water, add the jacket along with any other linen items you'd like to wash. Ensure that you don't fill the machine more than half full of linen. This prevents the jacket from getting tangled and allows it to circulate in the soapy water.Tip: If you're washing a load of linen fabrics along with your jacket, separate them by white, dark, and colored fabrics. This prevents dye from bleeding, especially if the linen hasn't been washed before. Don't wash non-linen items along with the linens because they might damage the linen fibers."

          "description":"Your linen jacket will become softer the more you wash it, so there's no need to use fabric softener. If you do use fabric softener, it will coat the fibers, which prevents the linen from wicking moisture and actually stops it from becoming soft."

Using any of these gentle settings prevents the linen fibers from being stretched or pulled during the wash. Remember to check the care labels of other linen items that you want to wash along with the jacket. If they have different care instructions, you'll need to wash them separately."

If the garment doesn't have a care label, wash it on the gentlest setting with warm, not hot, water. The care label also tells you what heat to set your iron to if you plan on ironing the jacket.
