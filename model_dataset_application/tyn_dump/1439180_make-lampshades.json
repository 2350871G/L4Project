Believe it or not, you can resurrect that perfectly good frame from the traps of that old, not-so-trendy fabric. Some lamps will have one-piece frames and some will have a set of two rings: a washer top and a bottom wire ring, generally. If you're unhappy with what you have at your disposal, new lampshade wire rings are available at some craft supply stores. This project will be constructing a drum shade--the fancy name for a circular shade. These are generally made up of two separate rings."

Your fabric needs to be at the very least one inch (2.5 cm) wider and longer than the width and circumference of your lampshade. You can either measure the circumference with a measuring tape or use the 'ol handy 3.14 x diameter trick. For example, if the diameter of your lampshade is 14 inches, 3.14 x 14 = 43.96, the circumference of your lampshade. So, you should be working with material that's at least 45 inches long. You can choose how far apart you want your rings to be to determine the width . A little more than a foot (31 cm) is standard."

    "Available at all craft supply stores, decorative trim (beads, tassles, you name it) can add the finishing touches onto your own personalized shade.",
    "This can be done with a bit of hot glue in a matter of minutes, so why not?",
    "Method Three: Leftover Fabric Shade Take the measurements of your frame.",
    "How far is it between the top and bottom wires?",
    "How far is it around?",
    "If you are working with a paneled shade, simply take the measurement of each panel; if you are working with a circular shade, measure the circumference (3.14 x diameter).",
    "This is necessary to find out how long and wide your strips of fabric need to be and the amount that will cover your entire shade.",
    "Cut strips of fabric.",
    "This is where the shade becomes all your own.",
    "Use one style of material for a battered, distressed look or use all types of coordinating colors and patterns.",
    "Just make sure they're long enough!",
    "Add one extra inch for the seam allowance.",
    "This is needed to wrap around the wire frame.",
    "If your lamp is 20\" (51 cm) around, make sure you have fabric that, in total, amounts to at least 22\" (56 cm) wide.",
    "You need adequate overlap to keep the wire frame from showing.",
    "Of course, greater overlap than that is always safe, too.",
    "If each strip of fabric is 2\" (5 cm) across, have at least 11 strips of fabric ready.",
    "Hem, trim, or edge the fabric with ribbon.",
    "This ensures that it stays neat, doesn't fray, and looks professional.",
    "The edges will only be seen from the inside of your lamp.",
    "If you're pressed for time or simply can't be bothered, a simple trim is fine.",
    "Attach the strips to the top and bottom of the lampshade.",
    "Using your 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side, affix the strip to the top of the shade with a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread.",
    "Repeat for the bottom.",
    "If you use a hot glue gun and glue the material to the wire, you will not be able to gather the fabric when it's finished.",
    "If you use a staple gun, it's a good idea to add decorative trim around the top and bottom to obscure those tiny metallic lines from view.",
    "Adjust the strips and add trim (optional).",
    "You can gather the material together if you stapled or used a needle and thread.",
    "Adjust the material to achieve the look you want.",
    "Beads, tassles, or extra ribbon can be added onto the top and bottom of your shade to hide any less-than-perfect areas or simply to add more flair."
