  "text":" Making a Dried Orange Garland Pre-heat your oven to 200\u00b0F (94\u00b0C).  Slice some oranges into \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick slices. How many oranges you end up using depends on your final design and how long you want the final garland to be. Plan on using about 11 oranges for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland. Bake the oranges in the oven for 4 hours, turning them every hour. You can place them directly onto the rack in the oven. Avoid using a baking sheet, as this will trap too much moisture and will prevent the orange slices from drying out properly. Every hour, use a pair of tongs to turn the orange slices. If you'd rather not dirty up your oven, place a metal rack on top of a baking sheet, then place the orange slices on the rack. Buy a big bag of bay leaves and empty it into a large bowl. Again, how many bay leaves you end up using will depend on how long your garland is, and how you choose to arrange the oranges, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks on it. You will need about 250 bay leaves for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland. It might be a good idea to go through the bay leaves first and pluck out any damaged or broken ones. Save those for cooking.

Plan on using about 18 cinnamon sticks for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland. Drill the holes from the curled/seamed side using an electric drill and a small drill bit.

The loop does not have to be very big; something big enough for your finger to slip though will be plenty. The loop will help prevent everything from sliding off.

Making a Salt Dough Garland Preheat your oven to 285\u00b0F (140\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix together the dry ingredients. Pour 1 cup (100 grams) of all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl, then add \u00bd cup (150 grams) of salt. Next, add 2 to 4 tablespoons of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ground allspice, \u00bd teaspoon of ground cloves, and 2 teaspoons of ground ginger. Stir them together with a whisk until they are all evenly combined. Stir in the water until the mixture turns to dough. Pour in a little bit of water, and stir it in with a rubber spatula.

You can always paint the pieces after you bake them, but the paint may cover up the wonderful aroma. Roll the dough out. Lightly flour a smooth surface, and roll the dough out using a rolling pin. Try to get the dough to be about \u00bc-inch (0.64 centimeters) thick. Cut the dough into shapes using cookie cutters. Hearts and stars are very popular, but you can also use circles, leaves, or other shapes. Poke two holes into the center of each ornament. Use a straw or knitting needle to punch the holes; keep them about \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) apart from each other. If you'd like a touch of extra fragrance and design, stick whole cloves, pointy-side-down, into your ornaments. Transfer the ornaments to your prepared baking sheet, then bake them for 2 to 3 hours.
