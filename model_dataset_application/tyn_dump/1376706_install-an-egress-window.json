Not all basement rooms legally need an egress window. However, basement bedrooms are not allowed without one. Check if you need any building permits to get started as well, and follow the procedures to get them.

Warning \n Make sure there are no buried utilities, such as electrical wires or pipes, before you start digging. You may need to get clearance from the city utility companies before starting the work. Dig the hole about 6 in (15 cm) deeper than where the bottom of the window will be, or as close as you can get without going past 44 in (110 cm) deep. This will allow for a window ledge. If you have a deep basement that forces you to dig the window well deeper than 44 in (110 cm), then most codes will still allow you to install the window as long as you put some sort of ladder or steps in the window well to provide access."

Putting in the Window Knock out the blocks where the hole will be with a 4 lb (1.8 kg) hammer. Start at the top-center and work carefully around the edges. Be careful not to loosen the blocks that will remain in place. If there are any blocks that are hard to knock out, start by breaking out the core of the block and then break away the rest. Chip the sides of the hole with a brick chisel to smooth them. Tap a brick chisel along the edges with a hammer. Check that the opening is big enough to fit the window frame and window.

Tip: You can build a frame to fit yourself with pressure treated lumber, or get one premade. Making one yourself will ensure a tighter fit.
