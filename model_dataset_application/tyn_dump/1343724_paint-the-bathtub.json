    "After the tub has been sanded, rinse out the interior and wipe down the exterior sides to remove any sandpaper and grit remnants.",
    "Use clean towels to dry it off thoroughly.",
    "The tub needs to be 100% dry before you start painting it, so use as many towels as you need to.",
    "Applying the Paint Tape protective sheets on the walls and floor.",
    "Before you paint, use masking or painters tape to secure plastic sheeting to the walls surrounding the tub, as well as to the floor underneath the tub.",
    "You may also want to lay plastic sheeting over any other fixtures, like the toilet or sink, and remove decorations, towels, and beauty products.",
    "The paint you\u2019re going to use is an acrylic spray paint, and the \u201cdust\u201d from it will settle on the walls and floors.",
    "Put on a respirator and wear old clothes once you\u2019re ready to paint.",
    "Your clothes are going to get covered in paint dust, so wear things that you don\u2019t mind getting dirty.",
    "And use a respirator for safety purposes\u2014the fumes from the paint will be really strong.",
    "Remember to keep a window open or a fan running during the painting process.",
    "Follow the paint manufacturer\u2019s instructions to prepare it properly.",
    "For a cast-iron or fiberglass tub, you can use acrylic urethane enamel, which may already come mixed for you, or you may have to mix it it, just depending on what kind of kit you purchased.",
    "For fiberglass tubs, you can also use a two-part epoxy paint instead of the acrylic.",
    "The epoxy paint can be used on porcelain and ceramic tubs, too.",
    "The easiest option for DIYing the paint job is to purchase kits that are designed specifically for that purpose.",
    "Some companies even provide spray cans of acrylic urethane enamel that you don\u2019t have to mix at all.",
    "Load your spray gun and put the lid on the paint can.",
    "Follow the spray gun\u2019s instructions for how much paint should be loaded into the body.",
    "Keep the lid on the paint can so that the enamel doesn\u2019t start to dry up.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to use a spray gun, you could also use paint brushes and rollers.",
    "In that case, you wouldn\u2019t need to load anything and could just mix the paint in its can to prepare.",
    "Coat the entire tub with long, even motions.",
    "Work systematically by starting at a top interior corner and working your way across the length of the tub.",
    "Keep the spray gun about 8 inches (20 cm) away from the tub.",
    "Repeat this process until the entire interior is painted, and then move on to the outside of the tub.",
    "Spray painting is generally an easier process because you won\u2019t have to lean over the tub and risk smearing the paint.",
    "Similarly, if you\u2019re painting the tub by hand, use long, even strokes to coat the tub\u2019s entirety.",
    "Let the first coat of paint dry and then apply a second one.",
    "It should take about 15-20 minutes for the first coat of paint to be dry to the touch.",
    "Once it is, go ahead and apply a second coat, working systemically as you go so you don\u2019t miss any areas.",
    "\u201cDrying\u201d and \u201ccuring\u201d are two different things.",
    "Paint can be dry but not yet cured\u2014the curing is when the paint dries and also hardens, and it generally takes a much longer time than just drying.",
    "Proceed with the second coat of paint once the first coat has simply dried.",
    "Finishing the Tub Leave the tub alone until it has cured completely.",
    "Don\u2019t step in it, run any water, or use it it any way.",
    "Follow the paint manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the curing time, which is generally around 24 hours.",
    "Some sites say you can also use a heat lamp to speed up the curing time, but that could also cause discoloration in the paint.",
    "Remove the masking tape and reattach the tub fixtures.",
    "Once the tub is dry, you can remove all the plastic sheeting and tape and replace the drain and faucet.",
    "Throw the sheeting and tape away.",
    "You may also want to mop the floor and give the rest of the bathroom a thorough wipe-down to catch any dust or dirt left behind from the painting process.",
    "Re-caulk the tub before you use it again to protect it from mold.",
    "Use a caulking gun to reapply the caulk to the areas where the tub meets the shower, if that\u2019s applicable.",
    "Follow the instructions for the brand you purchased and let it dry before you use the tub.",
    "Caulk can take 24 hours to cure, but it\u2019s generally safe to expose it to water after a few hours."
