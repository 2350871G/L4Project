A plastic spatula or wooden spoon is safest to use because it is less likely you will hurt yourself while scraping or puncture the gas line. Gently dig underneath the ice to begin removing it. Hold a bucket or trash can underneath the freezer door to collect the scrapings. Continue until most or all of the build-up has been removed.
