          "description":"Fold a white silk scarf in any way that you like to create random pleats in the fabric. Use two rubber bands to loosely secure the pleats at either end of the scarf. If you prefer, you can twist or roll the scarf to create random pleats. The pleats help create a textured look when you apply the dye."

          "headline":"Soak it in hot water.",
          "description":"Fill a large bot or bucket with hot water. Dip your scarf into the water to thoroughly soak it, and then squeeze it to remove all of the excess water. You don't need to use boiling water to soak the scarf. Hot water from your sink is sufficient."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Twist and roll the scarf.",
          "description":"After you've squeezed the excess water from the scarf, twist the scarf tight to create a tight roll. Next, wrap the twisted scarf around your finger to create a faux knot. Once you've created a knot with scarf, you can crumple it up further with your hand. Feel free to be creative when it comes to twisting, rolling, and knotting the scarf. You'll achieve different patterns with the dye depending on how you knot it up."

          "description":"When your scarf is knotted, place it in a large plastic zipper bag. Add a \u00bd teaspoon (1 \u00bd g) of powdered acid dye in your chosen shade to the bag, sprinkling it over wet fabric. Powdered acid dye is used to dye silk, wool, other protein fibers, and nylon, and is available in a wide range of colors. You can find it at most crafting supply stores. If you're dyeing an extremely large silk scarf, you may need to add a little more of the dye. When you sprinkle it over the scarf, most of the fabric should be covered."

Start with \u00bd cup (118 g), and add more if the scarf isn't totally soaked. Seal the bag and squeeze and massage the scarf with the water, dye, and citric acid to help the powders dissolve and penetrate the silk."

          "description":"When you've massaged the water, dye, and citric acid into the scarf, open the bag slightly so there is a 2-inch (5-cm) gap at one end. Place it in the microwave, and heat it on high for about 2 minutes. The bag will swell as it heats so you may need to stop the microwave and allow it to deflate before heating it again. You can tell that the scarf is done heating when the water in the bag begins to turn clear. If it isn't clear after 2 minutes, continue heating it in 2 minute intervals."

Start with about 8 to 10 drops of food coloring, and add more until you achieve as bright or deep a color as you'd like. Be creative with the food coloring. You can add food coloring in one color to one half of the scarf and coloring another shade to the other half instead of settling for a solid color."
