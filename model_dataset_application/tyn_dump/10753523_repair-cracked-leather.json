          "description":"Using a store-bought leather cleaner is the easiest way to prepare the cracked surface for repairs. Spray the cleaner on the cloth, then wipe away any grime on the leather. Rub along the leather\u2019s grain to avoid deepening the cracks. If you don\u2019t have a commercial cleaner, mix together 1 part mild soap with 8 parts distilled water. Use baby soap or a liquid dish or hand soap. Using a small amount of water is a safe way to rinse off soap. Dampen the microfiber cloth, wringing out the excess moisture, then wipe the leather along its grain."

        {
          "headline":"Wait for the leather to dry before treating it.",
          "description":"Touch the leather to check its condition. Cracks form when leather dries out, so your item most likely will feel dry within 5 to 10 minutes. To speed up the drying process, wipe the leather with a microfiber cloth. Make sure the surface feels dry to the touch so the soap or cleaner doesn\u2019t get in the way of the conditioner."

        {
          "headline":"Dab a strong leather conditioner onto the cracks.",
          "description":"Select a bottled conditioner designed to restore and rehydrate leather. Put a small dollop of the conditioner on your finger or a soft applicator like a sponge or cloth. Then, rub the conditioner directly into the cracks in order to clean out the fabric\u2019s pores and prepare them for deeper conditioning. Leather conditioner is available wherever leather items are sold, particularly online, at general stores, and at some clothing shops. The leather will absorb the cleaner right away. This happens with items that have dried out over time. Regular conditioning keeps leather soft and pliable."

          "description":"Apply a generous amount of conditioner to the applicator pad. This time, scrub over the cracks and the areas around them. Continue scrubbing along the grain. The leather will become a more consistent color, hiding the cracks. If the leather hasn\u2019t been conditioned in a while, consider treating the entire item now. Conditioning it prevents new cracks from forming elsewhere."

          "headline":"Let the leather rest for 2 hours until it feels dry to the touch.",

Wait until it feels dry to the touch before continuing to treat it. If you have the time, let the leather dry overnight. Waiting a little longer gives the conditioner plenty of time to rehydrate the leather."

          "description":"Depending on the conditioner, you may need to treat the leather multiple times. Spread more conditioner on an applicator pad and scrub it across the cracks. Check the leather again the next morning after giving it plenty of time to dry. Continue treating the leather until the cracks are gone or the leather stops absorbing the conditioner. If it stops absorbing the conditioner but the cracks are still visible, you will need to try a filler or dye."

Make sure the leather looks free of grime and feels dry to the touch before attempting to treat the scratches. Cleaning up leftover soap with water is fine, but use a lightly dampened cloth. Too much water exposure damages leather other time. Store your item in open air away from direct sunlight. Exposure to harsh heat and sunlight damages and fades colored leather."

Make sure the cloth removes all of the dust from the cracks so you can fill them in. Using higher grit or ultra fine sandpaper is safe, but avoid harsher sandpapers. Lower-grit papers are coarser and more likely to leave noticeable scratches."

Pick up some of the paste with the knife, then brush it onto the cracks to fill them with a thin layer of paste. Apply additional paste until all the cracks appear filled. Palette knives are thin and fairly blunt, making them a great choice for spreading the paste. If you don\u2019t have one, use another blunt object like a credit card. Avoid sharp knives or other objects that will scratch the leather. Leather fillers are available online and at some general stores. They are often sold in kits that may include a sanding pad and an applicator knife."

It will pick up the remaining paste. Continue removing the paste until you can no longer see it outside of the cracked areas. Place the excess filler in the cracks, back in the container, or wash the knife off in water as needed to remove it."

Scrape up the excess, then wait for then new layer to dry. When the leather is repaired, the cracks will no longer be distinguishable. Depending on how deep the cracks are, you may need to apply additional layers of filler. Some cracks require as many as 5 coatings. Repeat the treatment until the cracks are well-filled."

Filler is colorless, so it does a better job of permanently hiding bad cracks. For particularly deep or ugly cracks, add filler first so they don\u2019t stand out as much."

Rub the cracks to spread the dye into them. Leather dye is available online or at some craft and general stores. They are sometimes sold in kits that include sandpaper and applicator pads. Another way to color cracks is with spray paint and lacquer thinner. Get a matching color of spray paint safe for use on leather.

    "Heat the sealer with a hair dryer for 2 minutes to cure it.",
    "Activate the dryer one last time to finish the repair.",

    "Move the heater back and forth to prevent the leather from overheating.",
    "Once the leather feels dry to the touch, check it to make sure it looks as good as new."
