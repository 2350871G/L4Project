    "Start by scoring the sod with a spade to divide it into sections, then use your hoe and shovel to dig out each section.",
    "Remove at least 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) of the work area's surface.",
    "Recruit some friends or family to help make the job go faster.",
    "If necessary, you can bribe them with pool time!",
    "Roll up and dispose of your sod.",
    "A power cutter removes sod in sections that you can roll up and transfer to a wheelbarrow or lawn bags.",
    "Removing sod manually is messier, and you'll need to shovel the sod into your receptacle.",
    "When you're finished, you can leave lawn bags on the curb for pickup or add the sod (or a portion of it) to your compost heap.",
    "If you used a power cutter and your rolls of sod are in good shape, you could lay it down on a bare patch elsewhere in your yard.",
    "Water the bare patch well, fertilize it, and add compost if the soil needs conditioning.",
    "Then lay down the sod, and water it daily for 1 to 2 weeks.",
    "Choosing a Good Site Beforehand Check your local building codes.",
    "Choose the flattest spot possible, but make sure you comply with local codes.",
    "Check if your pool needs to be a minimum distance from property lines, septic tanks, and roads.",
    "Contact your local recorder's or assessor's office if you need to find your property lines.",
    "Run an online search or look for applicable codes on your city's, state's, or province\u2019s government website.",
    "If you have a homeowner\u2019s association, it\u2019s also wise to check its bylaws.",
    "Make sure your pool is not close to an easement or setback where workers might need to access power or other utility lines.",
    "Check to see if your pool might be in a conservation area if your property borders a forest.",
    "Avoid underground utility lines and overhead power cables.",
    "If you\u2019re not sure where your gas lines and other underground cables are, call your utility company.",
    "In addition, make sure your spot isn\u2019t under power cables.",
    "Stay away from trees and stumps.",
    "If your pool is under a tree, more leaves and bugs will fall into it.",
    "Aside from being unsightly, debris could affect the pool\u2019s chemistry and make it harder to maintain.",
    "Further, trees' root systems could get in the way of leveling the site, and even if the tree is a stump it will be difficult to remove.",
    "Setting your pool beyond a tree's farthest branches should be a far enough distance if the tree is established.",
    "For younger trees, you can calculate the size of the root system to be on the safe side.",
    "Younger trees have thirstier roots, which could extend up to 38 times the trunk diameter.",
    "If a young tree's trunk is 6 inches (15 cm) across, its roots could extend over 19 feet (5.8 m).",
    "Most older trees' root systems only extend about as far as its canopy.",
    "Consider the drainage in the area.",
    "It is important to make sure that the area where you want to put the pool has good drainage, or you could end up with a swamp in your backyard.",
    "Pay attention to how well the water drains after a heavy rain.",
    "If possible, avoid areas that stay waterlogged for long periods, or you can divert the water before putting in the pool.",
    "Mark off an area with a diameter 2 feet (61 cm) larger than your pool.",
    "Once you\u2019ve chosen a suitable spot, place a stake in the ground at its center.",
    "Divide your pool\u2019s diameter by 2 to find its radius, then add 1 foot (30 cm) to the radius.",
    "Cut a string to that length, tie it to the stake, and use it to trace the circumference of your work area.",
    "Mark the area with stakes or chalk.",
    "If your pool is shaped like an oval, use a measuring tape to trace its dimensions onto your work area.",
    "Remember to make your perimeter 1 foot (30 cm) longer than your pool on all sides."
