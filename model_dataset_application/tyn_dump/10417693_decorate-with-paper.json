          "description":"If you\u2019re having friends and family over for a nice dinner, create special place cards to add an extra touch of class to your event. You could cut out squares, rectangles, triangles, or even differently-sized cards, depending on your taste. Use a pen or finely-tipped marker to write the name of a guest on each card. Card stock works well for this kind of project because it\u2019s thicker and less likely to bend or crease. You can find lots of different colors of card stock at your local craft store. Put the place cards on top of each person\u2019s plate, or make a cute place card holder, like these pine cone place cards."

Look up tutorials online and follow instructions for how to make different kinds of flowers, from roses to carnations to wildflowers. Not only is this a fun craft, but it\u2019s one that allows you to switch out your flowers easily for a quick decor update. You could also make an entire flower bouquet out of paper."

Then you can stitch them together with a sewing needle and thread to make long, colorful decorations for your next party. You could create one long garland, or make several shorter ones for a layered effect. Choose colors that match your theme to keep everything looking cohesive. Cut out about 100 of each shape for a garland that\u2019s 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) long. To make this project easier, purchase a punch in the shape you want from your local craft store. For a cute Valentine\u2019s Day option, cut out heart shapes from red and pink papers, stitch them together, and then hang them from the ceiling so that it looks like hearts are flowing down. This can also make a fun backdrop for photos!"

Then, stitch 20-30 shapes together in a row with a needle and thread, leaving a little bit of space between each one. Repeat this process to create 7-8 different strands of shapes. Hang them from the ceiling at the head of your bed to create a whimsical illusion. The varied weights of paper will make the shapes on the strands hang a little differently from piece to piece, which will make it look more dynamic. Depending on how high your ceilings are, you may need to make your strands longer or shorter. If you live in a dorm room, this can be an inexpensive and cute way to make your room more personalized."
