  "text":" Simple Scent Addition Light a fragrance-free candle. Allow it to burn until a small melted wax puddle forms around the flame area. The candle should lack fragrance, else it may overpower or mix poorly with the scent you're adding. Use a pipette or dropper to add a single drop of essential into the melted wax puddle. Avoid placing the oil anywhere near the actual flame. Expect the scent to begin wafting out as the candle continues to burn. Top up as often as needed. Pressed Herb Scented Candles Consider designing the leaf pattern first. This will ensure that you arrange the leaves in a thoughtful way rather than quickly rushing to push them on. Look at at the leaves you have and imagine how they'll look and try to line them up in readiness for pressing on the candle. Fill the long jar with boiling water.  Dip the candle into the water. Hold it in place from the wick for 1 to 2 minutes. Ensure that it is all submerged. Remove from the jar and place on parchment paper. Place the leaves onto the softened candle surface, using tweezers. Press in place gently. Work quickly, once the wax solidifies, the leaves are stuck in place and no more can be added. Dip the candle into the hot water again. The leaves will be sealed behind a new layer of melted wax. Further dipping in the hot water will shift the pressed leaves further into the candle. Bear this in mind if adding more layers of leaves, as some will be deeper in, some closer to the outside if you approach this in several goes. Drip a few drops of essential oil down the sides of the candle before it solidifies. Aim for an even distribution. Let set. Repeat with as many candles as you'd like to make. These candles will keep for a very long time, but you may need to infuse more essential oil after long-term storage. Scented Floating Candles Drop the paraffin wax into the double boiler or bain marie. Heat the water in the base compartment of the pan. Wait for the wax to slowly melt. Add a little amount of wax dye disc to the melting wax. Add more if you wish\u2013-the more dye added, the deeper the color will appear. Add the scent. Add either a few drops of essential oil or wax perfume. Remove the top pan from the heat. Pour the melted wax into the molds. Leave to set slightly. Cut the wick. Cut into 5cm/2 inch lengths. Push each wick into the center of the setting wax. Top up with more wax if needed. The wax will shrink a bit as it sets; if you think it needs a bit more, feel free to add a little more melted wax as a top-up. Let set.  Use the candles as follows: Fill a shallow bowl with water. Float the candles on top. Add a few flat-headed flowers in between the floating candles for a prettier look. Light the candles when needed. Place the display in the middle of a table or somewhere else where a glowing decorative element is needed. Lavender Scented Candles Prepare the mold. Spray the soup can with mold release or silicone spray. Spread the lavender flowers across a baking sheet. Put to one side. Prepare the wick: Cut the wick. Cut it at least 2 inches/5cm longer than the height of the can mold. Attach the weight to the bottom of the wick. Attach the other end of the wick to the wick holder. The wick should feel taut and when it is rested at the top of the mold, there should be no slack. Melt the medium point paraffin wax first. Place in a double boiler and heat the water. Heat until it reaches between 185\u00baF-190\u00baF. Then add:\nThe purple crayon pieces;\nThe lavender essential oil;\nThen stir. Pour the melted wax into the soup can mold. Use a ladle to transfer the wax from the double boiler. Set aside to cool and harden. This will take about 3 hours. Remove the candle from the mold. To even the base, place the candle base on a hot skillet or frying pan for a few seconds. Add the flowers to the candle. Melt the high melting point paraffin wax in the double boiler. Melt until it reaches 200\u00baF to 210\u00baF. Paint the exterior of the candle with this melted wax. Immediately roll the candle over the baking sheet of lavender flowers. Many will instantly adhere to the sides of the candle. Let set. Done. The candle is ready for use or it can be stored long-term. Scenting the Wick Melt a little candle wax.  Add a few drops of the desired essential oil.  Prime the wicks. To do this, immerse the wicks in the melted wax for about 20 minutes. Then remove and pull them straight. Lay on parchment or greaseproof paper to let them harden. Make candles. Use the scent-primed wicks.",
