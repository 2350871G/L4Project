Prepare to face the Taurus Demon. Whichever method you choose to fight the demon with, you'll want to have leveled up your Endurance and Dexterity stats a fair bit, as you'll be doing a good amount of rolling and running during your battle. Otherwise, you'll also want to stock up on firebombs (about 20 of them to be safe), which can be bought from the merchant under the two spear Hollows in Undeadsberg, not far from the bonfire there. Enter the fog door. You'll find yourself on a crumbling bridge with a guard tower ahead and a guard tower behind you with a ladder and two Hollow marksmen.

Fighting the Taurus Demon with them shooting at you can be difficult, and two of the methods you can use to fight him need you to implement the guard tower, so killing the Hollows is easiest. Climb up the ladder and dispatch them both. Move to the middle of the bridge. At some point you'll trigger the arrival of the Taurus Demon, who will climb off the far guard tower. Run back to the cleared guard tower and decide which of the following methods you wish to kill the Taurus Demon with.  Using Firebombs Use firebombs to kill the Taurus Demon. This method is by far the easiest, but is also slightly longer than the other methods. Run to the first guard tower and climb the ladder to the top. The Taurus Demon will be waiting for you at the bottom of the tower. Move to the edge of the tower and look down.  Lock on to the Taurus Demon using the right thumb stick on your Xbox 360 controller.  Select a firebomb and throw it at the Taurus Demon using the X button of your Xbox 360 controller. It will explode and take a small chunk of health off the beast. Quickly run to the ladder and climb about a third of the way down it. Although it may be tempting to throw a second firebomb, usually it will take too much time to throw and the Taurus Demon will quickly kill you, or you'll accidentally fall off the tower, as throwing a firebomb moves you forward slightly.

Climb back up the ladder and repeat the process until you have killed the Taurus Demon. It may take a little while, but this method is by far the safest and easiest way for newcomers to the game to defeat the boss. Using Plunging Attacks Run quickly back to the tower after triggering the boss's appearance.  Climb the ladder to the top of the guard tower. The Taurus Demon should be waiting below by now. Move to the edge and fall off onto the Taurus Demon's head.  Press the Attack button (the right bumper on your Xbox 360 controller) as you are falling, initiating a plunging aerial attack which will make your character slam with weapon into the Taurus Demon's head and take a large amount of health off.

Dodge through his legs and slash him a bit while staying on the opposite side of the edge (with the Demon between you and the gap). There is a good chance he will jump back, and right off the edge. Committing Taurus Demon Suicide Lure the Taurus Demon to the area of bridge where the side has been destroyed. It is near the middle of the bridge and on the left side.

Once the Taurus Demon is on the bridge, get the snipers to start shooting you at the same time that you go behind, in front or underneath the Taurus Demon. The snipers will shoot the Taurus Demon.
