They\u2019re both healthy options, but your meal's texture will be affected by which variety you use\u2013 steel cut oats will be a little crunchier, while rolled oats tend to be quite soft. Try to avoid buying oats that are pre-mixed with sugar. While they may sound healthy, sugared oats aren\u2019t as good for you. They also tend to be excessively sweet. If you\u2019re cooking or baking, you probably want rolled oats. If you\u2019re adding oats as a garnish or topping, steel-cut is preferable."
