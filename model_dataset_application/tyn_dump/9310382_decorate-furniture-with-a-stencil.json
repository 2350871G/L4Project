Make sure the stencil is made of thick plastic that can hold up to paint. Opt for a large stencil with a floral pattern or geometric shapes if you are stenciling a big piece of furniture like a wooden dining table or a rocking chair. Or choose a smaller stencil if you are stenciling a smaller item of furniture, like a small side table or an accent chair. If you are stenciling furniture meant for a kid's room, you could pick a stencil with animals on it or a striped pattern."

Wipe the furniture with a clean cloth again after you have sanded it. Then, use a paint brush to apply one coat of furniture primer.

For example, you could use a gray or white base color if you are planning to use a bright blue or purple for the stencil. If you want the base color to be bold, go for a bright color. Then, use a neutral color for the stencil. For example, you could paint the furniture with a base color that is blue and use pale blue or white for the stencil color. You could also pick the base color and the paint color for the stencil based on the room you are going to put the furniture in. For example, if the color scheme in the room is teal and white, you could use these colors to paint the furniture."
