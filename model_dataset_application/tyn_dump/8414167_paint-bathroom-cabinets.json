Then, wipe down each cabinet with a clean cloth to remove any residue. Be sure to clean the inside and outside of each cabinet."

You'll also want to unscrew any handles, pulls, stops or hinges that might get in the way while you\u2019re painting. This way, you'll be able to work without obstructions. Keep everything together in one place to avoid losing important pieces. Labeling the individual bits of hardware or placing them in separate plastic bags can make it easier to keep track of everything. If you\u2019d also like to use this project as a chance to install new hardware, this would be an opportune time."

There\u2019s no need to remove every trace of paint or lacquer\u2014you just want to make the cabinet\u2019s outer surfaces coarse enough for the primer to cling to. Work out any rough edges or irregularities and aim for a smooth finish. Put on gloves and eye protection before sanding. Sand using smooth, circular motions, moving outward as you progress. Run the sandpaper straight along edges and narrow panels. Don\u2019t forget to get inside corners and along the inner edges of the cabinet doors. Use a Shop-Vac to deal with the dust and debris when you\u2019re done."

Primer will be useful for protecting the cabinet\u2019s underlying materials and getting the paint to hold better. Primers should be specially formulated for use with the type of paint you\u2019re working with. Water-based primers, for example, should be used only with water-based paints. Lightly sand dry primer to make the painting surface more uniform."

Mask the countertops as well. Make sure the tape is straight and even to avoid glaring mistakes. Painter\u2019s tape will allow you to establish exact boundaries for your paint job and cover areas that you want to keep clear. Wider tape will give you a greater margin of error and can be useful for painting near walls and trim. If you\u2019d prefer not to remove your cabinet doors prior to painting, fold a piece of painter\u2019s tape over the hinges to keep paint from getting on them. If your bathroom is small, consider painting the drawers and cabinet doors in another space that has better ventilation."
