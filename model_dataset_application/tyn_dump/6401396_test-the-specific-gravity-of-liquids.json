If your liquid is at a different temperature, the density of the liquid will not match the calibration of the hydrometer. This will cause your reading to be incorrect.

The number corresponding to this mark is the specific gravity of your liquid. The reading on the hydrometer is usually a decimal, but it is derived as a ratio of the density of your liquid to the density of water at a given temperature. In other words, if your hydrometer reads 1.1, that means your liquid was 1.1 times as dense as water at that temperature. Note that specific gravity is a unitless measurement. You can look up the specific gravity of some common liquids. Examples are listed below:\nAcetic Acid: 1.052\nAcetone: 0.787\nBeer: 1.01\nBromine: 3.12\nMilk: 1.035\nMercury: 13.633"
