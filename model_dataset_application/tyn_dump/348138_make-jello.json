You can also use any type of fruit you'd like. Grapes, berries, and orange pieces are great choices! If you are using a baking pan, choose one that is 9 by 12 inches (22.86 by 30.48 centimeters) or 8 by 8 inches (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters). This is great if you plan to cut the jello into fun shapes using cookie cutters. If you are using a fancy jello mold and would like to add some fruit, fill the mold with \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) of jello first, then add your desired fruit. Fill the mold the rest of the way with more jello; don't stir the fruit. This will give you a pretty design at the top of the mold."
