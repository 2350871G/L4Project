Warm the mixture over medium-high heat until a candy thermometer reads 240 degrees Fahrenheit (116 degrees Celsius), which should take 10 to 15 minutes. If you don\u2019t have a candy thermometer, fill a bowl with ice cold water. Drop some of the corn syrup mixture into the water. The mixture should easily form a soft, flexible ball in the water when it reaches the right temperature. If it forms thin threads instead, it isn\u2019t hot enough yet. If it forms a hard ball, you\u2019ve cooked it too long."

Divide the eggs in two over a bowl, and let the yolks to fall into the lower half. Move the yolks back and forth between the halves, allowing the white to drip out into the bowl. Continue moving the yolks until all of the whites have dripped out. Save the yolks for another recipe. If you don\u2019t have a stand mixer, you can use an electric hand mixer instead."
