Other ways to use chilies to deter elephants include:\nMix chilli pepper with old engine oil. Paint twine or string with this mixture and hang the twine around your field or garden. Collect elephant dung. Pile chilli pepper onto the dung and burn it. The pungent smoke will release chilli pepper residue into the air. You should keep away too! These can also be made into \"chilli-dung\" bricks or balls if you know how to fashion them this way. Tobacco might also work when ground up and mixed with engine oil and ground chilli. Smear this concoction on ropes surrounding the food garden or crops. Tobacco dust from tobacco factories can also be used, even without chilli."

The lights need to be very bright and there must be enough of them to appear intimidating. This method can also scare off hippos. But beware the potential for them to charge in response!"

Some ways to reduce the cost of having such a fence include:\nA single live strand of electric fencing located 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) above the ground can be sufficient to deter elephants, while allowing other animals to come and go untouched. Use bush poles instead of metal stanchions to reduce the costs. Use solar panels to create the electricity. However, you will probably need to guard the solar panels or find some way of preventing their theft."
