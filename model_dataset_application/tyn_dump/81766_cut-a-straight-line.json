Cutting a Straight Line on Paper Using Folding Gather your materials. All you need for this technique are scissors or a craft knife, paper, and your hands. This technique works best with stiffer paper that will hold a sharp crease. Fold the paper where you want the cut to be. Place the paper onto a hard surface and press firmly along the fold. The crease needs to be very sharp to provide the best guide for your scissors. Open the paper and fold it in the opposite direction. Hinge on the fold line so that you are folding the paper in the same spot. Press the paper firmly along the fold again. Cut along the fold line. You can use scissors or a craft knife to cut along the fold line. Move carefully so that you stay in line with the fold.

Mark the line you want to cut on the back side of the piece of wood: this will keep the front of the wood from splintering. Place the wood and cutting jig on sawhorses or a work table. Align the cutting jig with the line you just marked. Clamp the jig to the wood. Place the \"good side\" of the wood face-down. Circular saws cut clockwise, which means that most of the splintering happens on the side of the wood facing the blade. Align your saw with the fence on your jig. Pushing the saw away from you, move the saw steadily and slowly along the jig. You should have a straight cut!",

    "Fold the paper where you want the cut to be.",
    "Place the paper onto a hard surface and press firmly along the fold.",
    "The crease needs to be very sharp to provide the best guide for your scissors.",
    "Open the paper and fold it in the opposite direction.",
    "Hinge on the fold line so that you are folding the paper in the same spot.",
    "Press the paper firmly along the fold again.",
    "Cut along the fold line.",
    "You can use scissors or a craft knife to cut along the fold line.",
    "Move carefully so that you stay in line with the fold.",
    "Cutting a Straight Line on Fabric Using a Rotary Cutter Start with smooth, wrinkle-free fabric.",
    "Iron your fabric to remove any wrinkles and creases.",
    "Wrinkled fabric will cause jaggedness even if you cut a straight line.",
    "If you're using a fabric like linen or cotton, using spray starch will give your fabric a bit more body and make it easier to cut.",
    "Prepare your cutting area.",
    "Place a ruled cutting mat on a flat, level, stable surface with good lighting.",
    "A cutting mat will help you cut straight lines in fabric, and it will also prevent damage to your work surface.",
    "Cutting mats are easily found at most craft and fabric stores.",
    "Align your fabric on the cutting mat.",
    "Use a horizontal line to make sure your fabric is lying straight.",
    "Place a metal-edged ruler across the fabric, and line it up along a vertical line on the mat.",
    "Check twice, cut once.",
    "Double-check your alignment before you cut your fabric.",
    "Once you're satisfied, use a rotary cutter (kind of like a pizza wheel, but for cutting fabric) to cut the fabric along the edge of the ruler.",
    "Cutting a Straight Line on Fabric Using an Iron and Folding Start with smooth, wrinkle-free fabric.",
    "Iron your fabric to remove any wrinkles and creases.",
    "Wrinkled fabric will cause jaggedness even if you cut a straight line.",
    "If you're using a fabric like linen or cotton, using spray starch will give your fabric a bit more body and make it easier to cut.",
    "Place a metal ruler along the fabric where you want to cut.",
    "If you have a cutting mat, use the lines on it to help ensure that the ruler is straight.",
    "If you're cutting fabric that has a definite pattern or direction, make sure your ruler is aligned with the pattern.",
    "Depending on the fabric, this may mean you need to slant your line rather than cut a perfectly vertical line that skews the pattern.",
    "You must use a metal ruler for this step!",
    "Plastic rulers will melt once you apply heat.",
    "Fold the fabric over the ruler.",
    "If you have a fabric-covered ironing board, pin the fabric to the ironing board to keep it in place.",
    "Otherwise, you can just hold it securely with your hand.",
    "Use the iron to press a crease over the ruler.",
    "Applying gentle pressure, move the iron back and forth over the fold you just created.",
    "The ruler will help you press a perfectly straight crease.",
    "Open up the fabric and cut along the fold.",
    "Place the ruler alongside one edge of the fold to help keep your scissors or rotary cutter steady.",
    "Cut slowly along the fold.",
    "Cutting a Straight Line in Wood Using a Circular Saw Create a cutting jig for your saw.",
    "This process is fairly simple, and you'll be able to use the jig every time you want to cut a piece of wood.",
    "Use a sheet of 1/4\" plywood as your base.",
    "Cut a piece about 10\" wide and about 4' long.",
    "(If your project is much larger, make the base longer to provide more stability.)",
    "Cut a piece of 3/4\" plywood to form a \"fence.\"",
    "The fence should be a few inches wider than the width of your saw's motor and should be as long as your base.",
    "Align the base and the fence at the ends and one long edge.",
    "Use wood glue and screws to glue the base and the fence together.",
    "Clamp the jig to the edge of a work table.",
    "If you don't have one, you can secure a large sheet of plywood to two sawhorses and clamp the jig to the edge of that.",
    "Align your circular saw with the fence and cut along the base.",
    "This will trim any excess and make sure the jig fits your particular saw perfectly.",
    "Use a pencil and a straightedge to mark your line on the wood.",
    "Mark the line you want to cut on the back side of the piece of wood: this will keep the front of the wood from splintering.",
    "Place the wood and cutting jig on sawhorses or a work table.",
    "Align the cutting jig with the line you just marked.",
    "Clamp the jig to the wood.",
    "Place the \"good side\" of the wood face-down.",
    "Circular saws cut clockwise, which means that most of the splintering happens on the side of the wood facing the blade.",
    "Align your saw with the fence on your jig.",
    "Pushing the saw away from you, move the saw steadily and slowly along the jig.",
    "You should have a straight cut!"
