This can be particularly helpful if you are starting with pants, which tend to be cut to be more fitted in the legs. Frayed shorts generally come in a loose, hip-slung fit.

While it may be tempting to try to transform your old skinny jeans into a cool new pair of frayed shorts, you will likely end up with more of a tight, bike shorts look. Denim with a lot of stretch usually has a tighter fit, so you will likely want to avoid starting with a pair with a lot of elastic."

          "description":"If you don't already have a pair of denim with the right qualities for fraying shorts, check your local vintage and resale shops for an already worn-in pair to start with. Worn-in denim tends to be easier to fray than stiffer and more structured newer denim. Starting with already worn-in denim will also easily give your frayed shorts that desirable cool, relaxed vibe. Most second-hand retailers carry a lot of denim in various sizes, so it is likely that you will be able to find a pair or even two at very little cost."

Ending up with shorts that are too short is very common when fraying shorts, so trying on your starting product in front of the mirror will help you avoid such mishaps."

You will be able to use this mark as a reference as you fray your shorts to make sure that they don't end up too long or too short. Chalk is generally recommended because it easy to wash or wipe off of denim. You can also use a fabric pencil, which is available at most craft retail stores."

With chalk, draw a line across the front about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) inches longer than where you want them to end up. Use a ruler to make your line as straight as possible. Flip the denim over and repeat on the back. Cutting your denim longer than you want the final product to be will give you a little room for error, as well as room to fray the shorts to your desired length. If you want more coverage in the back, draw the line so they will be slightly longer in the back than in the front, about .5 inches (1.3 cm) further down the leg."

Once you have cut all the way across, fold them in half to make sure that both legs are the same length. If you want the back to be slightly longer than the front, cut a small slit in the front along the chalk line next to the outside seam. Stick the scissors through the slit and cut across the front along the chalk line, stopping at the inside seam. Once you have cut the front, flip the denim over. Cut from the outside seam in, angling slightly until the scissors line up with chalk line. Cut all the way across."

If you want your shorts to be only lightly frayed in the end, you will want to trim until they are only slightly longer than your first chalk dot or small line mark, about .25 inches (0.64 cm). If you want the bottoms to be very frayed, trim until they are about .5 inches (1.3 cm) below your first chalk mark. For lightly frayed shorts, you will only need to wash the shorts a few times to get the bottoms to start to fray. As you wash and wear them, they will slowly get more frayed. As the bottoms fray, the shorts will get just a little shorter over time, which is why you want to trim close to your desired length. If you want the bottom to be more frayed, you need to leave more length to account for the additional distressing you will need to do to reach your desired look."

If you want your shorts to be more distressed, run a razor blade along the bottom. If you want the shorts to be evenly frayed, apply the same amount of pressure all across the bottom.

Fold the material in half in the middle of your desired location and make a small cut with your scissors, about .25 inches (0.64 cm) to .5 inches (1.3 cm) depending on how frayed you want them to be. Rub the slits with sand paper to fray the fabric and soften the edges of the cut until you reach your desired effect. Where you cut these slits is up to you, but for reference, common distressing spots are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the bottom on one side, about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the seam of one of the front pockets, and/or on one or both of the back pockets. You can also use this method to further fray specific areas on the bottoms. When cutting slits on the bottoms, though, you will want to start with an extremely small cut so that you can seamlessly distress with sand paper without losing a noticeable amount of length."
