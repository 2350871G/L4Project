Doing so will minimize the risk of rice sticking to the pan. Most lugaw recipes use homemade stock, but a high-quality commercial broth can offer just as much flavor. Some cooks even prefer to use plain water instead of stock or broth, but doing so will create a much blander taste."

You do not need to add either seasoning to the dish. If you aren't sure how much to use, start by adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) fish paste. You can add more throughout the process as desired to suit your tastes."

The overall texture of the dish should be very thick when finished. Stir the contents of the saucepan frequently during the cooking process. Doing so causes the rice to release more starch, thereby creating a thicker lugaw. If the contents of the saucepan look too thick before the rice has fully expanded, you can add more broth. Add additional broth in 1/2 cup (125 ml) measurements. You can taste test the lugaw as it cooks, too, adding more pepper or fish paste as needed."
