          "description":"The intro section of this song, which forces you to alternate between green notes and the other notes on the neck at a rapid-fire pace, is considered by many to be one of the most difficult sections in the whole song. One common trick that Guitar Hero experts use to make this section easier is to keep the green note held down with a tool like a rubber band, a hair scrunchie, or an actual guitar capo throughout the whole section. This way, the player only has to focus on the other notes \u2014 not necessarily an easy task, but an easier one. If you want to use this trick, make sure the tool you use has a tight enough hold to keep the green button held down consistently but is loose enough to be quickly removed from the green button when you want to transition to the rest of the song."

          "description":"After the very first red note, the whole intro section is one giant sequence of hammer-ons and pull-offs, which don't require you to strum, just to touch the correct buttons. This means that, amazingly, it's possible to clear this section only strumming the first note. Extra strums won't lose you any points if they're on the correct notes, but they're not necessary, so you may want to focus less on them than on hitting the right notes. Hammer-ons are played by strumming one note and \"hammering on\" the second note above it by touching it without strumming. Conversely, pull-offs are played by strumming the first note and touching the note below it without strumming. In Guitar Hero, hammer-ons and pull-off notes have a white center (without a black border). The difficult thing about using solely hammer-ons and pull-offs for the intro is that, if you miss a single note, you will need to strum again to reset the \"string.\" If you're not paying attention, it's easy to miss dozens of notes by forgetting to strum after a mistake."

          "description":"Playing the intro section can be very difficult to play with one hand. If you are having a hard time reaching the blue and orange notes while keeping the green note held down, consider using your strumming hand to help. To do this, bring your strumming hand up the neck of the guitar after the first strum and use your index finger and middle finger to handle the blue and orange notes. For example, if you strum with your right hand, you would strum the first note with your right hand and then use your right index and middle finger to play the blue and orange notes (if you're a lefty, do the exact opposite.) Some high-level players even use the elbow of their strumming hand to hit the first note \u2014 this allows them to have their fingers in place for tapping right away."

However, this part isn't impossible if you know what's coming:\nThe intro pattern ends on a green note and the scales start on an orange note \u2014 these happen to be at the same places as they are during the intro pattern, so if you're paying attention, you can transition smoothly from one to the other.

This isn't actually true \u2014 in Guitar hero, if you're playing a single note, you can have any notes \"under\" it (further down the fret) held down and you'll still hit the note. Because there aren't any chords (two notes or more at once) until just before the lyrics start, you can actually leave the rubber band on until then and it won't affect your playing. This is handy because it keeps you from missing notes by taking a second to move the rubber band out of the way during the early parts of the song, which are packed with notes. After the first chord, there's a brief pause in the guitar part, so you'll have a second to get rid of the rubber band safely."

The best way to tackle these parts is not to wildly strum as fast as you can \u2014 this can actually cause you to lose points and break your streak by playing too many notes. Instead, you'll want to use a quick but very steady rhythm. Since there are so many notes packed into these sections, using a strumming tempo that's not steady can cause you to miss dozens of notes. For sections like the \"Post Insanity\" section right after the intro where this fast rhythm alternates between multiple notes, concentrate on keeping your strumming steady and just move your fretting fingers when you need to switch notes. Once you get your strumming under control, these sections actually aren't that hard."

    "In addition, playing at easier difficulties will allow you to get past the intro so that you can practice the parts that come after.",
    "Practice other difficult songs for variety.",
    "The skills that allow you to beat other difficult Guitar Hero songs are just as useful for \"Through the Fire and Flames\" \u2014 plus, practicing other hard songs will give you a little variety to keep you from \"burning out\" on Dragonforce.",
    "Below are a selection of Guitar Hero songs from the games that have \"Through the Fire and Flames\" that are considered to be some of the most difficult:\nGuitar Hero III\n\"Raining Blood\" by Slayer\n\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" (cover) originally by Charlie Daniels Band\n\"One\" by Metallica\"\nGuitar Hero Smash Hits\n\"Play With Me\" by Extreme\n\"Beast and the Harlot\"  by Avenged Sevenfold\n\"The Trooper\" by Iron Maiden Listen to the song in real life.",
    "Part of what makes \"Through the Fire and Flames\" so hard to clear is that it's very difficult to guess what will come next.",
    "However, listening to the song in real life until you more or less remember how the whole thing goes can make this a little easier.",
    "Once you have a good feel for the progression of the song, you can plan ahead as you play it in Guitar Hero \u2014 for instance, if you know that Herman Li's impossible solo is about to start, you may want to hold off on triggering your star power until you really need it."
