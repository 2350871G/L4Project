You will want to examine your handwriting as you practice, evaluating your results and making any changes that you think are needed. Regular practice has been shown to be a great way to learn and maintain skills. Many worksheets are available on-line and have examples that you can practice with.

          "description":"Before you begin to practice at keeping your sentences straight without lines, you will want to use lined paper to help guide your writing. These lines will help you practice keeping your writing straight, allowing you to have straighter writing when you write without them. Letters known as \u201cdescenders\u201d should have their body sitting on the line while their stems dip below the line. The letters g,p,y,q, and j are all descenders. Letters that are classified as \u201cascenders\u201d should have their body sitting on the line and their stems should extend upwards, about halfway to the line above. The letters b,d,h,t,l, and k are ascenders. All other letters should rest directly on the line."

You will need a ruler or straight-edge and a pencil to draw your guide lines. These lines can help keep your writing straight and can be erased after you are done writing. Place your ruler straight across the page where you want to write a line. Lightly draw a guide line with your pencil. Remove the ruler. Use this guide line to keep your writing straight. After you are done writing, you can erase the guide line and leave your straightly formed writing."

Writing slowly can also help you to write straighter, as it gives you time to adjust the slant of your writing as you go. Always relax and take your time when writing to help you keep your sentences in a straight line. Rushing to write can cause your handwriting to slant or look untidy. As you write slowly, focus on keeping your sentences in straight lines. Slowing down can also help you learn better during practice sessions."

By focusing on using  your entire arm and wrist, instead of just your fingers, you can help your writing to look clean and straight. Practice by making large letters, drawing them in the air with your hand. Avoid using your fingers to draw a letter. This can result in slanted handwriting and may cause your hand to cramp up. Use your entire arm and wrist to form your letters which will make your writing more fluid and straight."

By sitting in the right way, your movements will shift and allow you greater control over your handwriting. Sit down with your feet flat on the floor and keep your back straight. Place your non-writing hand on the table to balance yourself. Don't practice writing while sitting on something soft like a couch or reclining chair."

Holding your writing utensil incorrectly can cause you to lose control over it, resulting in sloppy or tilted sentences and letters. Always make sure you are holding the pen or pencil properly when you are practicing writing. Hold the pencil close to the tip, using your thumb and pointer finger to grip it. Let the pencil rest on your middle finger, near the last knuckle. Don't grip the pencil too tightly."
