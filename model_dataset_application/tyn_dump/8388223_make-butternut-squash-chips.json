Soak the slices for 10 minutes before you strain the squash slices and pat them dry with a towel. Soaking and drying the slices of butternut squash gets rid of some of the starch.

Since you'll want to fry the butternut squash chips in batches, ensure that the oil comes back to 325 degrees F (160 C) before frying another handful of butternut squash chips."
