Then, turn the hand wheel once so that the thread will catch. Make sure that the thread tension is firm but not too tight as well. Having tension that is too tight may result in broken thread, while loose tension may result in sloppy stitches. You may use any type of thread for this stitch. The zigzag stitch is often used as a decorative one, so using a contrasting tread may produce an attractive result. For example, you could use red thread on a blue skirt hem, or secure the edges of a purple blanket with yellow thread."
