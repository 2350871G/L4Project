  "text":" Popping the Popcorn Place the popcorn kernels in a paper bag. For cotton candy flavored popcorn, plain, air popped popcorn works best. Add 9 tablespoons (113 g) of unpopped popcorn to a brown paper bag, and fold the bag closed several times. When you\u2019re making a large amount of popcorn, it may burst out of the bag when it pops. You may want to use a piece of tape to secure the bag closed. You should wind up with approximately 12 cups (96 g) of popped popcorn if you start with 9 tablespoons (113 g) of unpopped kernels. Microwave the bag for several minutes. Once the popcorn kernels are secure in the bag, place it in the microwave. Heat the popcorn on high for 2 to 3 minutes, or until there are 4 seconds between each pop. The time needed to pop the popcorn will depend on your microwave.

Sort through the popcorn, and remove any unpopped kernels. You can also remove any burnt or misshapen pieces of popcorn. Making Cotton Candy Coated Popcorn Melt the vanilla candy melts in the microwave. Add 16 ounces (453 g) of vanilla candy melts to a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the melts for 1 minute at 50% power, and then stir the bowl to ensure that the candy melts evenly. Continue heating the melts in 30 second intervals, stirring after each one, until the candy is fully melted. You can substitute marshmallow flavored candy melts for the vanilla if you prefer.

Fold the cotton candy in with the spatula so it\u2019s evenly distributed throughout the popcorn. You can usually purchase cotton candy at candy stores and some grocery stores.

Heat them in the microwave one at a time to melt them just as you did  with the vanilla candy melts. If you prefer, you can use just one color of the melts. However, using blue and pink makes the popcorn look like cotton candy. Divide the remaining popcorn in half and mix each one with a different color of the melts. Take the remaining 4 cups (32 g) of popcorn, and divide it in half. Place 2 cups (16 g) in one medium bowl and the other 2 cups (16 g) in another. Mix the blue candy melts into the first bowl and the pink candy melts into the second to coat each half. Use a spatula to gently mix the popcorn and candy melts so you don\u2019t break the popcorn. Spread the popcorn out on a cookie sheet to set. After you\u2019ve mixed the two bowls of popcorn with the colored candy melts, pour each out on a large cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow the popcorn to sit for 3 to 5 minutes so the candy coating can set. Combine all of the popcorn. When the colored candy coating has set on the popcorn, transfer the blue, pink, and white popcorn into one large bowl. Gently toss all of the popcorn together to mix the colors, and serve. The popcorn makes ideal party favors for a birthday or baby shower. Place it in small cellophane bags and tie them off with blue and pink ribbon. Preparing Cotton Candy Popcorn Balls Combine the water, sugar, and corn syrup. Add 1 cup (237 ml) of water, 1 \u2154 cups (333 g) of sugar, and \u2153 cup (100 g) of light corn syrup to a large pot.
