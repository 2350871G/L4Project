Cut off the tops and dry them completely on a kitchen towel or in a salad spinner. Roughly chop the tops in order to get 2 cups (50 g) of carrot tops. Since most grocery stores won't offer conventionally grown carrots with the tops still attached, you'll probably want to buy organic carrots with their tops."

You could also use almonds or walnuts, if you prefer. Use the smallest food processor you have, since the blade of a larger one may not reach the garlic and pine nuts."

Add them to the food processor along with the carrot tops that you cleaned. Put the lid on the processor and puree the pesto until the mixture is a chunky paste. You don't have to chop the basil leaves. Just strip enough leaves off of the stems to make 1/2 cup (12 g)."

Pulse it several times so the oil is incorporated and the pesto thins a little. Remove the lid and taste the pesto. Add salt and pepper according to your taste. You can make the carrot top pesto up to one day in advance. Ensure that you press plastic wrap or a lid directly onto the pesto so it doesn't turn dark as it chills."
