For instance, Top Hat bushes grow best in climates that experience minimum temperatures no lower than \u221250 \u00b0F (\u221246 \u00b0C).

A 12 in (30 cm) pot is good for most young blueberry bushes, but use something wider if the bush crowds up against the pot\u2019s edges. The starting pot you choose will last your blueberry bush 2 to 3 years on average. Make sure you choose a well-draining pot with drainage holes in its bottom. Pots from 20 to 24 in (51 to 61 cm) in diameter are better for blueberry bushes a few years old. The type of pot you use doesn\u2019t matter much and is up to your personal preference.

If the soil feels wet or soggy, hold back on the water until the soil dries up again. For the best results, water your bushes frequently but lightly several times a week. If you can, use rainwater on your blueberries. Rainwater has less of an effect on the soil pH than tap water. Drip irrigation is a great way to maintain the soil\u2019s moisture level.

Slow-release fertilizers give blueberries a continual boost instead of a big dose of nutrients all at once. Add the fertilizer directly to the soil. Many growers choose ammonium sulfate. At a gardening center, ammonium sulfate will be labeled as 21-0-0. The number means it consists of 21 parts nitrogen, 0 parts phosphorus, and 0 parts potassium.
