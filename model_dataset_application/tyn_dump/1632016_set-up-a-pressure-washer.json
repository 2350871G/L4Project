Set Up a Gas Power Washer Check the oil tank of the power washer. Remove the oil dipstick and check the levels. Add more oil if the levels are low, but do not overfill the engine crankcase. Fill the fuel tank with fuel. Small residential pressure washers generally use gasoline, larger commercial ones may use diesel fuel instead. Set up the spray gun.
