Dip an old, straggly brush in the stain and wipe most of it off. Lightly drag the bristles over the paint to leave streaks along edges and places where the door might have been damaged. A crackle medium causes the paint over it to shrink together and leave wiggly cracks, revealing wood or undercoats beneath.
