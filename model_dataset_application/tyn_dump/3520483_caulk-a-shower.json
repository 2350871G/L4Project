Using quick, sharp strokes, slice under the length of all old caulk beads. Go along each edge of the caulk with your blade to get it removed. If you are caulking a new shower, there won't be any caulk for you to remove. Note that metal blades and chemical caulk removers can damage plastic tubs. Use a plastic blade if your tub or shower is made of plastic."

          "description":"After you slice off the majority of the caulk, there will likely be some small pieces left on the walls. Scrub the sides of the shower with a dry, nonabrasive pad or sponge to remove as much of the old caulk as you can. Follow that by wiping down the surface with rubbing alcohol or scrubbing it with a multi-surface cleanser to remove any remaining caulk, shower scum, or grease. If your old caulk was made of silicone, use a pad or rag soaked in mineral spirits to break down any remaining bits of caulk. Use a soft rag and not an abrasive one, so that the shower surface is not scarred.Tip: Different cleaning solutions work better for different kinds of caulk. A non-abrasive pad and multi-surface cleanser will likely work well to get small pieces of non-silicone caulk off your shower. However, rubbing alcohol or mineral spirits work best for silicone caulk."

Use a utility knife with a fresh blade or a 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide, razor-sharp chisel to cut the tip off the nozzle. Some tubes of caulk will even have a line on the nozzle to indicate the point at which you should cut. Smooth out the edges of the tip after cutting it off, if necessary. If a piece of plastic remains hanging on the nozzle after being cut, pare it down with your utility knife or a piece of sand paper. Otherwise, this little burr can prevent the bead from being smooth.Tip: If you find that your initial cut produces a bead that is too small, you can always cut a little more off the tip at that point.

If you move the caulk gun too fast, the bead will become too thin and will break into chunks along the seam.

If using a rag, press it into and along the caulk with your finger to apply enough pressure to make the bead smooth. If using your fingertip, clean your finger off periodically with a damp rang to prevent the caulk from smearing beyond the seam. Work in a continuous motion to avoid inconsistencies and to create a smooth, concave line. If you can do the caulking and smoothing at once, you will save yourself time. Place the tip of your index finger over the joint as you caulk. By applying a small amount of even and consistent downward pressure, you will be able to apply and smooth the caulk at once. Smoothing is essential for both aesthetic and practical purposes. During the smoothing process, the caulk is forced to adhere more securely to the surface it fills and the finished product looks more neat and professional. Wear a disposable nitrile, latex, or vinyl glove to protect your fingers from wear and tear and to keep them clean. Wearing gloves makes the process much easier to clean up afterward since the glove can simply be removed and thrown away."

    "Also, position the tip at a 45-degree angle down the line of the joint so that the tip is pointing slightly in the opposite direction of how you will be moving down the joint.",
    "Apply even pressure as you move the caulk gun along the joint.",
    "Press the trigger gently to release the caulk bead into the joint.",
    "As you move the caulk gun along the length of the joint, continue applying even pressure to create an even line.",
    "You can either push or pull the gun.",
    "It is entirely a matter of preference, so do whichever option feels most comfortable to you.",
    "If you are right-handed, try bracing the nozzle with your left hand and squeezing the handle with your right.",
    "For left-handed individuals, try the opposite.",
    "Tip: After squeezing your nozzle the first time, do not squeeze it again until there is a good size drop coming out of the nozzle.",
    "Squeezing it too much could make a bunch of caulk come out of the tip before you are ready.",
    "Match the speed you move the gun to the speed the caulk is flowing.",
    "As the caulk starts to come out, keep moving the gun along the seam you are filling.",
    "If the rate at which the caulk is flowing differs too much from the rate at which you move the caulk gun, you could end up with too little or too much caulk along the seam.",
    "If you move the caulk gun too fast, the bead will become too thin and will break into chunks along the seam.",
    "If you move the caulk gun too slow, you will end up with excess caulk in the seam, wasting caulk and making smoothing out the seam cleanly more difficult.",
    "Smooth the caulk while it is still wet.",
    "Use a dampened finger or a moist, lint-free cloth rag to smooth out the bead of caulk immediately after applying it.",
    "If using a rag, press it into and along the caulk with your finger to apply enough pressure to make the bead smooth.",
    "If using your fingertip, clean your finger off periodically with a damp rang to prevent the caulk from smearing beyond the seam.",
    "Work in a continuous motion to avoid inconsistencies and to create a smooth, concave line.",
    "If you can do the caulking and smoothing at once, you will save yourself time.",
    "Place the tip of your index finger over the joint as you caulk.",
    "By applying a small amount of even and consistent downward pressure, you will be able to apply and smooth the caulk at once.",
    "Smoothing is essential for both aesthetic and practical purposes.",
    "During the smoothing process, the caulk is forced to adhere more securely to the surface it fills and the finished product looks more neat and professional.",
    "Wear a disposable nitrile, latex, or vinyl glove to protect your fingers from wear and tear and to keep them clean.",
    "Wearing gloves makes the process much easier to clean up afterward since the glove can simply be removed and thrown away.",
    "Cleaning up after Caulking Clean up with a damp rag or mineral spirits, if necessary.",
    "Clean up any areas where caulk has accidentally gotten on the shower surround before it dries.",
    "For acrylic caulks, use a damp rag to clean up mistakes.",
    "For silicone caulks, wipe down any excess caulk with a soft cloth rag soaked in mineral spirits.",
    "Remove the tape before the caulk is dry.",
    "Peel the tape off slowly and do not let it touch any of the fresh caulk.",
    "If the tape left ridges of caulk behind along the edge, clean these up by smoothing the area out again with a damp rag or damp finger.",
    "Pull the tape off at a downward, outward angle.",
    "This will keep the removed tape away from the bead, minimizing the chance of messing it up.",
    "Let the caulk cure before using the shower.",
    "Look at the label on your caulk tube for curing times.",
    "In most cases, it's a good idea to wait at least 24 hours before running the water or using the shower.",
    "If you run the water over the caulk before it finishes curing, you might rinse some of it away or cause it to smear and run, creating a big mess and weakening its seal on the seam.Tip: This is why it's a good idea to plan out when you will apply new shower caulk.",
    "If you do it right after taking a shower, you won't have a hard time waiting a day to shower again."
