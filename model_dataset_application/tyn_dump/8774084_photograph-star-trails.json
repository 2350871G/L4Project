Lock the base into place and take care not to hit or bump the base as you move around the site. Though you can use film, digital cameras lend themselves better to photographing star trails. With a digital camera you can choose to do one long exposure or overlay several quick pictures, and you can see the photo(s) before leaving the site of the shot."

This will prevent the camera from attempting to auto-focus repeatedly as you go. If your camera doesn't auto-focus, you will have to bring the camera into focus manually by adjusting the focal length of the lens."

Most cables can be locked so that the trigger stays in place until you release it. This saves you from having to keep your finger on the camera the for the duration of the exposure.

Use as little light as possible to make them look great. If you don\u2019t have photography lights, use a flashlight. You can add filters to your light to cast different colored lights onto the foreground."
