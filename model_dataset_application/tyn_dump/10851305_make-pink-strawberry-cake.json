          "description":"Since it takes about 15-20 minutes for most ovens to come all the way up to temperature, it\u2019s a good idea to preheat the oven before you start baking. This is also a good time to prepare your cake pan. Spray a 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) pan with non-stick cooking spray or put a little vegetable oil on a paper towel and wipe it across the bottom and sides to coat it thoroughly. Greasing the pan will keep the cake from sticking when it bakes."

Then, add 2 tbsp (12 g) of freeze-dried strawberry powder, 2 1/2 tsp (10 g) of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp (3 g) of kosher salt. Set this mixture aside for now. You can either buy freeze-dried strawberries and crush them yourself, or you can use freeze-dried strawberry powder, which you can find online and at some speciality baking stores. If you don\u2019t have kosher salt, use coarse sea salt or regular table salt. Did You Know? Mixing your dry ingredients together first will ensure they\u2019re evenly distributed throughout the cake."

Then, beat the mixture with a stand mixer or a handheld mixer on medium to medium-high until it becomes pale yellow and very fluffy. This should take about 3-5 minutes. If you don\u2019t have an electric mixer, use the back of a wooden spoon to combine the butter and sugar.

Continue doing this until you\u2019ve mixed in all 4 egg yolks. Remember to wash your hands after you handle raw eggs to reduce the risk of spreading salmonella.

    "Here, you\u2019re looking for soft peaks when you lift the mixer.",
    "Don\u2019t mix the cream long enough to get stiff peaks.",
    "This will create an almond-flavored whipped cream that\u2019s perfect for this strawberry cake!",
    "Chill the whipped cream until you're ready to assemble the cake.",
    "If you keep the whipped cream at room temperature, it may start to weep and deflate.",
    "To avoid this, place the bowl into the refrigerator once you\u2019ve finished whipping it.",
    "If you need to, you can whisk the whipped cream for a few minutes to revive it when it comes out of the fridge.",
    "Assembling the Cake Trim the edges off the cooled cake with a serrated knife.",
    "Once the cake is completely cooled and you\u2019ve prepared the strawberries and the whipped cream, turn the cake out onto a flat surface.",
    "Use a serrated knife to cut off the crispy edges from all around the cake.",
    "If it\u2019s difficult to work with the whole cake in one piece, you can cut the cake into quarters.",
    "Cut 10 heart shapes out of the cake.",
    "Using a 2 in (5.1 cm) heart-shaped cookie cutter, press out 10 hearts.",
    "You may need to alternate directions in order to get enough of the shapes from the cake.",
    "For instance, if your first heart piece is right-side up, you may want to turn the cookie cutter upside-down on the next piece in order to waste less cake.Tip: If your heart-shaped cookie cutter is larger or smaller, adjust the number of heart shapes accordingly.",
    "Place one of the heart-shaped slices in the bottom of each bowl.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to serve this sweet, pretty treat, place a heart-shaped piece of cake in the bottom of each person\u2019s bowl.",
    "You should have enough cake to make 5 servings.",
    "Spread about 1/5 of the strawberries and juice onto each bottom cake.",
    "Use a large spoon to pour the strawberries and juice onto the heart-shaped cake in the bottom of the bowl.",
    "The amount you\u2019ll use will depend on how much the strawberries broke down during the maceration process, but it\u2019s fine to just eyeball it.",
    "Top the strawberries with whipped cream and sprinkles.",
    "Just like with the strawberries, you don\u2019t have to be exact with the measurements.",
    "Simply scoop a generous spoonful of whipped cream on top of the cake and strawberries, then add red, white, and pink sprinkles for decorations.",
    "You can use as many or as few sprinkles as you like, or you can leave them off altogether if you don\u2019t want to add them.",
    "Top the dessert with a second heart-shaped cake piece.",
    "Once you\u2019ve added strawberries, whipped cream, and sprinkles to each serving, finish this sweet dessert by adding another heart-shaped cake piece on top of the bowl.",
    "Then, serve the cake to your family and friends, and enjoy!",
    "Refrigerate any leftovers.",
    "However, for best results, don\u2019t assemble the cake until you\u2019re ready to eat it.",
    "Otherwise, the cake will get soggy."
