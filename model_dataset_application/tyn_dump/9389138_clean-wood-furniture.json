To clean a feather duster so you don't spread dust around, take it outside and shake it out well. You can also vacuum it with a HEPA filter vacuum. If the duster is particularly dirty, swirl it in a solution of warm water and mild dishwashing soap. Rinse it thoroughly and allow it to air dry.

In the event of spills or other accidental messes, though, you should do a thorough deep cleaning to remove any sticky residue or film. Getting a Deeper Clean with Mineral Spirits Moisten a cotton ball with the spirits and test them on the furniture. Mineral spirits usually don\u2019t damage most wood finishes, but you should still play it safe. Dab some on a cotton ball, and rub it on a hidden spot of the furniture. If there\u2019s no damage to the finish, you can clean the entire surface with the mineral spirits. If the finish reacts poorly to the mineral spirits, don\u2019t clean the surface with them.

Wipe down the furniture with the cloth. When you\u2019re sure that the cloth is not dripping, rub it over the wood surface to thoroughly clean it. Mineral spirits can often remove years of dirt, so work slowly and carefully to get rid of all the grime. Dampen a cloth with water and rinse the surface. After you\u2019ve thoroughly cleaned the furniture with the mineral spirits, wet another clean, lint-free cloth with water. Wring it out so it\u2019s not dripping, and gently wipe it over the furniture to rinse off the mineral spirits. Dry thoroughly with a cloth. To avoid having excess moisture sitting on the wood, it\u2019s important to dry the furniture. Use another clean, lint-free cloth to wipe down the surface and remove any moisture. Waxing the Furniture Wax wood furniture only after it's been thoroughly cleaned. Furniture wax helps form a protective film on the surface of the wood. If the furniture is dirty when you apply it, you'll only wind up trapping the grime beneath it, which can make it more difficult to get the furniture clean in the future. Place a spoonful of wax on a clean cloth and knead it. Use a cloth that\u2019s made of 100 percent cotton and lint-free. The spoonful of wax should resemble the size of golf ball. Wrap the cloth around the wax, and gently knead it with your hand until the wax is softened. To protect your wood furniture, you should wax it after each time that you clean the furniture. Buff the wax into the furniture until you\u2019ve covered the entire surface. Once the wax is softened, rub it over the wood with the cloth in circular motions.
