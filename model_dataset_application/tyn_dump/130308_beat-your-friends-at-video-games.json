      "description":"Learn how much damage you do with each hit in a set amount of time, and how many hits you can get off safely whether it be ammo in your gun or punches from your fighter. Learning your DPS (damage per second) is crucial when you want to get good with a game. It is the difference between playing more defensively when you're weaker or full out aggression when you can \"Tank n' Spank\" your way to victory."

      "headline":"Pay attention to damage efficiency.",
      "description":"Have that really strong attack that takes a couple seconds to pull off? While that single attack might be impressive and flashy it isn't the optimal way to play. Weaker but quicker attacks may not be flashy on their own, but they will be a lot easier to chain together. The look on your enemies face will be worth it when you have them \"Perma-stunned\"."

      "headline":"Learn the mechanics.",
      "description":"Just learning what the mechanics are isn't all of it. You need to learn every single detail of the game. Have an attack that missed your opponent, but it seemed like it hit? He might have learned that he has some invulnerability frames during that time, or you might not realize that FPS you're playing is \"hit-scan\" rather than projectile based. Mastering these under the hood mechanics will surprise your friends and make every game you play an entirely different experience."

      "headline":"Take breaks.",
      "description":"No one can play a game for five hours straight and maintain a continuous level of focus and skill, especially when you are training on your own. Make a sandwich. Write a poem. Just do something that does not require you to look at a screen at least a few minutes every hour."

      "description":"Try to beat the hardest boss on the hardest settings only using your worst weapon. When playing multiplayer games where you are part of a team, volunteer to join the team that has the highest chance of losing. Eventually, your friends won't be much of a challenge at all."
