Pour enough water to cover the dried chickpeas by an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm). Let them soak overnight. If you'd rather use canned chickpeas, you can simply measure out 1 1/4 cup (300 g) of canned chickpeas."

Set the onion aside while you dice the potatoes into 1-inch (2.5 cm) long pieces. Get out a box grater and grate the two medium tomatoes. Set these aside while you prepare the chorba. It's fine to mix the grated tomatoes with the diced potatoes, since they'll be added to the chorba at the same time."
