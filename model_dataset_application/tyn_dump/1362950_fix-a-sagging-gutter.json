Place your ladder so both of the feet are firmly planted on the ground and lean it against your home carefully. Climb your ladder and always maintain 3 points of contact. For example, if your ladder is 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, you would calculate 12/4 = 3 feet (0.91 m) away from the side of your home. Wear a tool belt so you can have both hands free while you\u2019re using your ladder. Ask someone to support the bottom of the ladder for you so it doesn\u2019t slip or fall. Never stand on the top step of a ladder since you\u2019re more likely to fall."

Align the end of the threaded spike with the hole in the front of your gutter and push the end through by about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Don\u2019t push the spike all the way through, or else you could bend or deform your gutters. You can get threaded gutter spikes from your local home improvement or hardware store. Avoid using gutter spikes that don\u2019t have threading since they can easily pull out from your fascia board and cause the gutters to sag again.Tip: If the head of the new gutter spike can fit through the front hole on your gutter, drill a new hole \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) away from the first one that\u2019s the same diameter as the spike\u2019s shaft.

Place the ferrule inside the gutter and slide one end of it over the end of the threaded spike. Position the other end of the ferrule so it lines up with the hole on the back of your gutter so you can push the spike through it completely.

Tap the shim in with your hammer so it\u2019s flush with the gutter and holds the spike firmly in place.
