Be extremely careful when handling the knife, as you\u2019ll be cutting in the direction of your opposite hand.

The blade should be situated above the tongue but below the jawbone itself. Be sure to start on the side closest to you so you\u2019re moving the blade away from yourself.

If you\u2019re working with a knife that doesn\u2019t offer quite as much dexterity, you can also cut partway through the backbone and remove both the head and intestines at the same time."

Alternatively, you can cook the trout whole, then deal with the inedible parts once it\u2019s soft and pliable.
