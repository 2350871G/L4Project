Though you may be overwhelmed by the giant pile of stuff you've created on your floor, desk, or bed, rest assured that you'll find the right place for everything soon enough. Remove everything out of your closet. Your clothes, shoes, and anything you keep in your closet can go in a pile on the floor in front of the closet. Remove everything from your desk. You can place the papers and anything else you find on the desk's surface. Remove everything from your dresser. If you're creating too much of a mess, remove one drawer at a time. Take any other items that are laying around and place them on your bed and on the floor. If taking everything out of its place at once is overwhelming and is taking up too much space, you can tackle your room by taking apart one area at a time."

          "description":"Before you begin to figure out where everything should go, you should get a number of boxes and label them for different purposes. Crates or plastic bins will work just as well, but boxes are best because you can just recycle them when you're done organizing and won't have to deal with more clutter. Here's how you should label the boxes:\n\nKeep. The items that you keep will be items that you use on a regular basis. If you've used the item in the last two or three months, you should keep it. Store. These are things that you can't bear to throw away, such as something with sentimental value, but which you rarely use. You can also store away a large portion of your clothes that you won't wear until the next season or two. If it's the middle of the summer, you can store your winter sweaters, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your summer dresses. Give or Sell. These are items that may benefit someone or could be sold, but which you don't need any more. You may have a nice sweater that you don't fit into anymore that you can donate, or an old textbook that you can sell. Throw Out. These are items that no one needs -- including you. If you have to spend time wondering what something is, or when the last time you even saw it was, it's time to toss it."

Though you may want to throw everything in the \"Keep\" box, or have put every last extra item in the \"Store\" box, this won't help you get organized. You need to do some soul-searching to figure out what you really need in your life. Remember that less really is more; the less things you have, the easier it will be to organize your room. Try the twenty second rule. If you have to spend more than twenty seconds looking at an item and asking yourself if you'll ever use it again, the answer is no. If you have something you know you don't need but don't want to part with it, try giving it to a friend or family member so you feel better about it being in someone else's hands."

Just throw out everything in the \"Throw Out\" box. Find a local church, Goodwill, or another organization that is taking donations, and bring all of your donated items there. Be prepared for the place to tell you that they won't accept some of your items. You can either try to donate them somewhere else, or just throw them out. Start selling your \"Sell\" items. Have a garage sale or put them on craigslist. Store your storage boxes. If you have a storage unit or another place outside of your room to place them, great. If not, store them in a part of your room you won't be using very often, such as under your bed or in the back of your closet.

If you have a larger closet, it may be a good place to store your additional items or to keep your shoes and accessories. Here's how to organize your closet:\nThe first thing you should do after you've sorted your clothes into the \"Keep\" and \"Store\" piles is to take one more hard look at your clothes. If you haven't worn a certain item in over a year, it's time for it to go. The only exception for this rule is if you have a very formal gown or suit that you haven't had a chance to wear. Organize your clothes by season. Keep the summer, spring, winter, and fall clothes on the same part of the closet. If you have room for storage in the closet, store those off-season clothes in a bin in the back of your closet. Hang up as many of the clothes as you can. Try organizing them by the type of garment they are. For example, when you hang up your summer clothes, keep tank tops, t-shirts, and dresses separated. Make use of the space below your clothes. If you've hung up your clothes, you should still have a few feet of space below them, so don't waste it. Use the space for a storage bin or for a shoe rack. If you have a door that opens instead of a sliding door, invest in a shoe rack or jewelry holder that hangs over your door. This is a great use of space. If you don't have a door there, you can consider hanging one of these over your bedroom door. If you have room in your closet for a dresser, this is the perfect place for it."

If there's a better place for the clutter, like your bathroom, desk, or top drawer, put it there. Find a good use for your top dresser drawer. Don't just use the top drawer to throw in everything that doesn't have a good place. Decide what this use will be, whether it's for socks, comic books, or baseball cards.

It should be easily accessible since you'll use these items often. Vow to keep all of the desk things on the desk. If you use the stapler, return it to the desk, or it may get lost. Designate a place for your writing utensils. Have a cup or small case for keeping your writing utensils so you no longer have to spend fifteen minutes looking for a pen. As you do this, go through your utensils to make sure that all of them work. Toss out the ones that can barely write. Create a filing system for organizing your papers. Create folders or drawers designated for different tasks. One drawer could be used for important papers that you don't use often, such as the title to your car, your lease, contracts, and other important forms. Another drawer or folder could be designated for papers for a certain subject or aspect of your life. Don't mix these up. Minimize the clutter on the surface of your desk.
