  "text":" Day-After-Thanksgiving Panini Grab two slices of your favorite type of bread. Any bread will do, but sourdough is considered best for paninis as it keeps its structure with wet fillings and toasts well. Lay some lettuce and leftover cranberry sauce on a slice. The lettuce will prevent the sauce and fillings from making the bread too soggy, and the cranberry sauce will add a sweet touch. Layer slices of your leftover turkey on top of the cranberry sauce. Generally you should use just enough to make a single layer, to stop the sandwich from getting too big, but if you don't mind using a knife and fork, go ahead and add as much as your heart desires. You can optionally spread mashed potatoes or stuffing on the turkey for a heartier panini. You can certainly add both, but it will end up being a heavy meal to eat in one sitting. Mash up some candied yams to add a sweet touch to the panini. This is not required to make the panini, but some find that the candied yams make the sandwich taste sweeter. If you used a lot of cranberry sauce, candied yams can counteract its tartness but can also make the sandwich overpoweringly sweet, so be careful of how much you add. Pour gravy on the top of your fillings and put the bread slices together. Don't go overboard on gravy, as you still have to cook the panini and a runny sandwich is hard to grill correctly. Put the sandwich together and spread a light layer of butter on the outside of the bread. A good rule of thumb is to use enough gravy to be able to spread a thin layer on the top slice, so that the bread absorbs some of the liquid and becomes more flavorful while also controlling the gravy's messiness. Cook on medium-low heat in a grill pan or skillet. Cook it until the bread looks crusty, not burnt, and make sure the fillings are hot. You can use a panini maker if you have one, but it is not required. Once it's done, grab a plate, a knife and fork if the sandwich is gigantic, and enjoy! Pulled Turkey Barbeque Sandwich Peel off pieces of dark turkey meat, and toss them into a bowl. Pulled turkey barbeque is best with the darker parts of the turkey meat because of its richer flavor and higher fat content, but can be made with any part of the turkey, except of course the bone. Use as much leftover turkey as your heart desires, there is no set amount you should use. Add your favorite barbecue sauce to the bowl and mix thoroughly.

Chop up and saute the bacon until it is crispy in the saucepan before adding the barbeque sauce and turkey. Toast some buns as the turkey cooks in the barbeque sauce. Use hamburger buns for a sloppy joe style sandwich, or sourdough buns if you want to absorb some of the barbeque into the bread. After toasting the buns, add a layer of coleslaw on the bottom bun for a little extra crunch and refreshing flavor to the smoky barbeque sandwich. Add a good amount of barbeque turkey to your bun, and feast! Be prepared to get messy, and think about using a knife and fork if the sandwich ends up being large. Barbeque turkey sandwiches go fantastically with sweet apples, so consider garnishing your plate with a few slices. Turkey Stock Roast the turkey bones in the oven on a baking sheet. Peel the leftover bones as clean as you can of any pieces of meat or skin. Put the bones on a baking sheet in a single layer, and roast at 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) until it is browned.

Sprinkle 1 teaspoon (5.7 g) of thyme and sage, and add the skin, fat, and meat that you removed from the bones. Keep everything in big chunks for easy straining when the stock is finished. Thyme and sage are optional, but can infuse your leftovers with fresh flavor. Toss the roasted bones into the pot, and cover ingredients with water. Fill the pot with water so that it covers the ingredients about 4 inches (10 cm) higher than the surface.

Stuffing and Turkey Casserole Mix your leftover turkey and stuffing together in a casserole dish. Use as much turkey and stuffing as you like, but don't fill it over the rim of the dish or you won't be able to add anything else to the casserole without it spilling over. Pour a can of cream of mushroom soup and white wine over the casserole. Use a full can of cream of mushroom, but try to avoid using concentrated soup. Add about \u20443 cup (79 ml) of white wine to the casserole as well. You can use cream of chicken soup if you want the casserole to taste meaty rather than mushroomy. If you prefer to avoid alcohol, you can use \u20443 cup (79 ml) of milk instead of white wine. Bake the casserole at 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C) for 20 to 30 minutes until golden. Be sure to press the casserole down into the pan to make sure it does not overflow the casserole dish when cooking. Look for the stuffing to start browning very lightly on top to know when it is finished cooking. You can broil the casserole for up to 5 minutes if you want the top to be extra crispy, but be careful of leaving it in the oven too long at this high a heat or you could burn it. Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes, and serve. You can add leftover roasted veggies as a side, or enjoy the savory and filling meal on its own. Turkey Salad Chop up the potatoes, cranberries, celery, and onion. Chop each ingredient into small pieces and mix together thoroughly in a large bowl. If you are using fresh veggies rather than leftover veggies, be sure to cook them properly first in a skillet. Potatoes can take a little while to be ready to add to a salad, so be sure to boil them in advance. The same goes for onion, which can be sauteed ahead of time if you want them hot, or can be left raw for a cold salad. Mix the leftover turkey with your veggies and additions in the bowl.
