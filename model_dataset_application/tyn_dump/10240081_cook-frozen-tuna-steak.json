For tuna steaks and other fish, there's no need to remove the bags when thawing the fish. The tuna steak will still properly thaw when wrapped in the plastic bag. Place the tuna steak in the fridge. It's very important that you don't leave the tuna steaks out at room temperature in the kitchen or elsewhere in the house.

Most microwave manuals have instructions on how to defrost different types of frozen food. Generally, the first step is to weigh your tuna steak. Place the tuna steak on your kitchen weighing scales or on a paper towel on top of your household weighing scales. Make a note of the weight of the tuna steak on a piece of paper or on your phone.
