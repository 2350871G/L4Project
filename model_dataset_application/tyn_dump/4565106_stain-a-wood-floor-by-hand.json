Sometimes there are variations in the color from batch to batch. If you pour a can in halfway through that is from another batch, you will see half your floor a different color.

You have a rag for dipping into the stain and wiping it on (ragging on) and then another rag for drying the excess off the surface. You'll want to replace them both after 10 to 15sq m (110 to 165sq ft) as they get too full of stain."

Then use the other rag to wipe over that area you have stained to dry the surface. That is, to remove the excess stain from the surface. This is key."
