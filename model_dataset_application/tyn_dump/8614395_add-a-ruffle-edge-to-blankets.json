  "text":" Sewing a Ruffle Cut a strip of fabric twice the perimeter of your blanket. Measure the sides of your blanket and add them together to get the perimeter. Multiply the perimeter by two.

Fold the strip of fabric in half lengthwise with the right sides facing out. Press it flat with an iron as you fold so that you get a nice, crisp edge. When you are done, you should have a double-sided strip of fabric that's 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide. If you cut a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strip of non-fray fabric, skip this step. Sew a double seam along the raw edge. Sew along the raw edge using a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance first. Then, sew another row of stitch right next to it, this time using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Use a straight stitch and a long stitch length for both rows. Do not backstitch.

Remember to only pull on the bobbin threads. Tie and cut the threads off. Once the strip is the right length, cut the threads down to a manageable length. Tie them into tight, secure knots, then snip off the excess. Your ruffle is now ready to attach! Pin the ruffle to right side of your blanket. Make sure that the raw edges of the ruffle match up with the raw edges of the blanket. You want the folded edge of the ruffle to be facing towards the middle of the blanket. Overlap or tuck in the raw edges of the ruffle. Fold one of the edges inward by \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) so that it is still tube-shaped and has a smooth, folded edge all around. Tuck the other edge in by about \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter). Sew the seam down using a ladder stitch or a straight stitch and a \u215b-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance. If you are using non-fray fabric, you can simply overlap the two ends by about \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter). You can stitch them down using a straight stitch, or leave them be. Pin the blanket lining on top. Make sure that you place the second piece right side down, so that the ruffle is sandwiched inbetween. If you are adding a ruffle to a single-sided blanket or an existing blanket, you can skip this step. Sew around the blanket using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Make sure that you backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. If you are sewing a double-sided blanket, leave a 12 to 18-inch (30.48 to 45.72-centimeter) gap along one of the edges so that you can turn your blanket inside out. Turn the blanket inside out and press it flat. Use something pointy, like a knitting needle, to help push out the corners. Press the edges flat with an iron. If you are adding a ruffle to a one-sided blanket or an existing blanket, fold the ruffles outward and the seams inward. Press the seams flat. Sew the gap shut. You can stitch it shut by hand using a needle, thread, and ladder stitch.

If you are adding a ruffle to a one-sided blanket or an existing blanket, top stitch the seam down, \u215b-inch (0.64-centimeter) away from the ruffle. Crocheting a Ruffle Choose your yarn color. You can use the same color as the rest of your blanket or a contrasting color. It would best to use the same weight of yarn, however. If you do end up using a different weight of yarn than the rest of your project, make sure that you get the matching crochet hook. This method will teach you how to add a crochet ruffle to a crochet blanket. You may be able to use it on a knit blanket as well. Join the yarn to first stitch using a slip stitch. Choose an edge to start with on your blanket. Poke your crochet hook through the first stitch on that edge. Catch a loop of yarn, then pull it back through the stitch. Chain stitch three. Keep a hold on the tail as you work, or you will accidentally pull your ruffle off of your work. Stitch two double crochets in same stitch as the chain stitch. This seems like a lot of stitches, especially for a single edge stitch. These double crochets will flare out eventually, however, resulting in a ruffle. Stitch three double crochets in next stitch. You are doing three this time around because the initial chain counted as a double crochet. Repeat the previous step for rest of row. Do three double crochets in each stitch. Stop when you are one stitch away the corner. Add extra stitches in the corner. There are two ways that you can do this. The simplest way is to simply keep going, and do three double crochets in the stitch to the left of the corner, and three more double crochets in the stitch to the right of the corner. Alternatively, you can do six double crochets in the gap just under the corner. Repeat the process for the remaining three edges.

Gently tug on the tail to tighten the knot, then weave the tail back into your work using a yarn needle. Knitting a Ruffle Choose your yarn color. You can use the same color as the rest of your blanket or a contrasting one. You need to use the same weight of yarn, however, because you will be counting stitches. Because of how big blankets are, it is recommended that you only use this method for small blankets, such as baby blankets. Cast on twice as many stitches as the edge you wish to add the ruffle to. Count the number of stitches along the edge you will be adding the ruffle to. Multiply that number by two, then cast on that many stitches onto your knitting needle. Knit in stockinette until the ruffle is the height you want it to be. The stockinette stitch is where your knit one row and purl the next. Keep knitting until the ruffle is about the length you want it to be, about four rows total. Knit a row of decreasing stitches. You will be knitting together two stitches for the entire row. Knitting together two stitches is very easy. Simply push your knitting needle through two stitches, then knit them as though they are one stitch.

Then, use your left needle to catch the first stitch that you knit, pull it over the second stitch, and off of the right needle. Knit another stitch. Again, use your left needle to pull the new first stitch over the new second stitch. Keep doing this until you reach the end of the row. This cast off row is now the bottom edge of your ruffle. Finish off the ruffle. Cut the yarn, leaving behind a long tail. Pull the tail through the final loop, and tug on it gently to tighten the knot. Do not trim the tail off yet; you will use it to bind the ruffles together. Knit three more ruffles. Make sure that you cast on the right number of stitches. The top and bottom edges of your blanket may be the same, but the side edges may have a different number of stitches. Bind the ruffles to your blanket. Thread a yarn needle with a yarn color that matches either your blanket or your ruffle. Start sewing the ruffle to the blanket by weaving the needle through the top edge of your blanket and the bottom (gathered) edge of your ruffle. Continue sewing the other ruffles to the other edges. You will likely run out of yarn at some point. If that happens, simply knot the old yarn off, weave in the end, and thread a new length of yarn. Make sure that the knit sides are all facing up and the purl sides are fall facing down. Bind the corners of the ruffles. Thread your yarn needle onto one of the tails leftover from the cast off. Use it to weave the edges of the ruffles together. When you reach the top edge, knot the yarn off, weave it back down the seam, then trim off the excess.",

    "Because of how big blankets are, it is recommended that you only use this method for small blankets, such as baby blankets.",
    "Cast on twice as many stitches as the edge you wish to add the ruffle to.",
    "Count the number of stitches along the edge you will be adding the ruffle to.",
    "Multiply that number by two, then cast on that many stitches onto your knitting needle.",
    "Knit in stockinette until the ruffle is the height you want it to be.",
    "The stockinette stitch is where your knit one row and purl the next.",
    "Keep knitting until the ruffle is about the length you want it to be, about four rows total.",
    "Knit a row of decreasing stitches.",
    "You will be knitting together two stitches for the entire row.",
    "Knitting together two stitches is very easy.",
    "Simply push your knitting needle through two stitches, then knit them as though they are one stitch.",
    "Here is the process in more detail:\nPush the tip of your right needle through the first two stitches on your left needle so that it comes out the back.",
    "Use your right needle to catch a loop of yarn from behind your work.",
    "Use your right needle to pull the loop through both stitches.",
    "Gently pull it tight.",
    "Slip both of the stitches off of your left needle.",
    "Knit together the next two stitches.",
    "Purl the next row.",
    "This will prepare you for the final cast off row, which must be done as a knit.",
    "Cast off the final row.",
    "Start by knitting the first two stitches onto your right needle.",
    "Then, use your left needle to catch the first stitch that you knit, pull it over the second stitch, and off of the right needle.",
    "Knit another stitch.",
    "Again, use your left needle to pull the new first stitch over the new second stitch.",
    "Keep doing this until you reach the end of the row.",
    "This cast off row is now the bottom edge of your ruffle.",
    "Finish off the ruffle.",
    "Cut the yarn, leaving behind a long tail.",
    "Pull the tail through the final loop, and tug on it gently to tighten the knot.",
    "Do not trim the tail off yet; you will use it to bind the ruffles together.",
    "Knit three more ruffles.",
    "Make sure that you cast on the right number of stitches.",
    "The top and bottom edges of your blanket may be the same, but the side edges may have a different number of stitches.",
    "Bind the ruffles to your blanket.",
    "Thread a yarn needle with a yarn color that matches either your blanket or your ruffle.",
    "Start sewing the ruffle to the blanket by weaving the needle through the top edge of your blanket and the bottom (gathered) edge of your ruffle.",
    "Continue sewing the other ruffles to the other edges.",
    "You will likely run out of yarn at some point.",
    "If that happens, simply knot the old yarn off, weave in the end, and thread a new length of yarn.",
    "Make sure that the knit sides are all facing up and the purl sides are fall facing down.",
    "Bind the corners of the ruffles.",
    "Thread your yarn needle onto one of the tails leftover from the cast off.",
    "Use it to weave the edges of the ruffles together.",
    "When you reach the top edge, knot the yarn off, weave it back down the seam, then trim off the excess."
