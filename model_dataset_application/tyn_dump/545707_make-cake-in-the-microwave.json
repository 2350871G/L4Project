  "text":" Baking a Mug Cake in the Microwave Pick your mug. You can use any type of mug for the cake. A larger deeper mug will create a softer moister cake, while a smaller shallower mug will create a firmer cake. Create the cake mix. Add two tablespoons of brown sugar or honey to the mug. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and then 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of flour. It is okay to use regular flour if you don't have self-rising, but the cake will end up more like a brownie in texture. Crack an egg into the mug. The great thing about mug cakes is that there is virtually no cleanup; just toss the shell in the compost or trash. Add butter. Soften a stick of butter on the countertop and scoop a tablespoon into the mug. You can use salted or unsalted butter, or margarine. Add a tablespoon or two of chocolate chips (optional). Adding the chocolate chips will create a chocolate flavored mug cake. If you prefer a vanilla cake, you can add an additional tablespoon of vanilla extract instead. Mix it all together.
