A vacuum with an upholstery attachment is very useful for getting dirt out of seams and zippers. You may also use a nylon scrub brush to remove stubborn debris.

The wrapped cushions can then be placed wherever you have space, from your garage to your attic. You can find tarps at most home improvement stores. Plastic tarps resist water well. However, water may still drip inside improperly-wrapped cushions. If the wrapping comes undone, your cushions will be exposed to the air, which can be an issue in a humid environment."

Make sure there is no moisture in this spot, since any water can mean you will uncover mold-stained cushions in spring. Enclosed areas like sheds offer protection from rain. However, be aware of water leaks as well as moisture in the air. If you open nearby doors and windows a lot, humidity and temperature changes can damage the cushions."

Wrap your cushions in plastic first to ensure they stay as dry as possible. If the bench or steps are out in the open, make sure water doesn\u2019t soak the ground around the cushions.
