  "text":" Preparing the Wood Choose the piece of furniture that you want to lacquer. If it has a rough surface, you will need to sand it first with a medium (80-grit) sandpaper until the edges are even. Employ a power sander for faster results. Fill in any holes with lacquer filler. Regular brands of filler will not be compatible with the chemicals in lacquer. Sand the surface again with extra fine (120-grit) sandpaper. The sanding will create a smooth surface but also help the primer to stick to the surface of your wood. Wipe the furniture thoroughly with tack cloths. Remove all debris before continuing. Vacuum the entire area with a shop-vac to remove excess dust before you start your finishing process. Set down clean drop cloths. Choose a very well ventilated place to apply your lacquer. Many types of lacquer are toxic and flammable. Applying Lacquer Purchase a lacquer base/primer. It will help the lacquer to stick more easily to the surface. If your wood has a very rough finish, do two coats of lacquer primer. Dry according to package directions in between coats. Buy cans of colored lacquer spray. Aerosol lacquer is the best product to use the first time you try the method because it can be applied uniformly. If you must apply liquid lacquer, use a wide natural bristle brush. Practice on another piece of wood before you finish your piece of furniture. Wear a mask, safety goggles and gloves when you apply all paint and lacquer.  Sand the surface of the primer with fine-grit sandpaper. Wipe it with a tack cloth before applying your lacquer. Shake the can according to package directions. Hold the can between 10 and 18 inches from the surface of the furniture. Spray it in small horizontal strokes. If the surface starts to dimple, like an orange peel, you are holding the can too far away. If the surface starts to streak, you are holding it too close. It may take a few practice strokes to find the ideal distance for your climate and furniture. Cover the entire surface with a coat of lacquer. It will take a half hour or less to dry, but 48 hours to cure. Let each coat cure before you apply another layer. Applying Additional Lacquer Coats Sand the surface lightly again, with fine-grit sandpaper. Wipe with a tack cloth. Apply a second coat of lacquer. Let it cure. Sand and wipe the surface. Apply a third coat of lacquer and let it cure for 48 hours. Lacquer is thinner than other finishes and requires more coats. Finish by buffing the surface of the furniture with No 0000 steel wool. Wipe with a tack cloth, and then apply paste wax to the surface. Buff the surface with a lint-free cloth.",
