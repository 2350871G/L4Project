          "description":"Mahogany trees can grow in a range of soil types, but they do thrive best in well-drained sandy loam soils. Avoid heavy clay soils and duplex soils. Additionally, mahogany trees do best in neutral soils. They can survive in strongly acidic soils, too, but avoid planting them in alkaline soils. If you need to use naturally alkaline soil, amend it with sphagnum peat, ammonium nitrate fertilizer, sulfur-coated urea, or agricultural sulfur. Most mahogany trees are resistant to salt spray, so soils frequently drenched by salt water mist should not present a problem. Since mahogany trees have deep root systems, you should make sure that the soil you plant it in runs deep, too."

Mahogany trees tend to have large canopies and long roots, which is why appropriate spacing is so crucial. Similarly, it is best to plant multiple mahogany trees at least 15 feet (4.57 m) apart. You should be able to plant grasses, flowers, and small shrubs near the base of the tree without much problem, however."

The healthiest mahogany trees will have several evenly spaced major limbs that spread out along one central trunk or central leader. As the tree grows, these limbs will be at least 2 feet (61 cm) apart from one another, if not further. Prune away any upright leaders aside from the central trunk. These upward growing branches can make it more difficult for the tree to tolerate strong winds and storms, thereby weakening it.

Some of the biggest problems come from shoot borers, longhorn beetles, powder post beetles, tent caterpillars, tip moths, scale, leaf notchers, leaf miners, Cuban leaf beetles, mahogany webworms, and Sri Lanka weevils. Among these insect pests, borers present the greatest threat to the health and longevity of the tree. When borers are present, pesticides should be applied. The other pests mostly cause aesthetic damage to the tree and don't often cause structural damage. As a result, pesticide application is not as crucial when these pests are spotted. You can treat the tree or choose not to do so. When selecting a pesticide, look for one specifically labeled to work against the type of pest you are trying to kill.

Look for discolored bark along the branches of the tree, particularly where the branch meets the trunk. As the fungal disease progresses, the discoloration can turn into small cream-colored to reddish cankers that develop on the surface of the bark. These bumps will continue to grow and can eventually kill entire branches or trees. The best way to save a mahogany tree facing nectria infection is to remove the infected wood. You may also apply a fungicide to the tree, but fungicides do not always work on this particular type of infection."
