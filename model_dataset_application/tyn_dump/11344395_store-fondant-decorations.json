Use a pea-sized bead of shortening and rub it onto your decorations until it\u2019s clear. Try to work the shortening into any exposed fondant to make it less likely to dry out. Shortening creates a protective layer that traps the moisture inside the fondant. Don\u2019t leave large globs of shortening on your fondant or else it could affect the flavor."

Don\u2019t put your fondant in the fridge or freezer since it could form condensation when you take it back out, which can make the decorations wilt or sag.
