Don't teach with a thin or glittery yarn, since it can be difficult to see the stitches. Choose a yarn that's thick enough to hold between your fingers easily.

You can buy metal, plastic, wood, or bamboo needles so ask the child which type feels the most comfortable and use those. Bamboo and wood may be more comfortable to work with because they'll warm up between the child's hands as they knit.

The child will get used to handling the yarn and will gain confidence when they see that they're knitting a chain. You don't need to have the child make anything using the chain. Instead, they can simply practice weaving with the yarn and you can see how well they do with following basic instructions."
