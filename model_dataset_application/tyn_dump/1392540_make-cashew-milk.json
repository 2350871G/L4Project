You will also get the best taste if you use raw cashews that haven\u2019t been roasted or salted. Store the cashews in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you are ready to use them.

Cover the container with a kitchen towel and leave the nuts to soak at room temperature for at least 2 hours. You can also leave them overnight or up to 48 hours. The longer the cashews soak, the creamier your milk will be. If you forget to soak your cashews before you make the milk, you can also put them in hot water for 15 minutes to soften them up a bit.

Place it over a large bowl. Pour the nut milk through the strainer. Gather  the ends of the cheesecloth and twist closed. Squeeze and press the bundle of nut pulp inside the cheesecloth to get as much of the nut milk out into the bowl as possible. Unstrained cashew milk has a tendency to separate in the fridge and will need to be stirred before serving. Save the cashew pulp for other recipes. Freeze it in a sealable plastic bag or an ice tray and pop it into your next smoothie for a hint of nutty flavor. Add some to your oatmeal or to cookie or muffin dough. Try folding it into homemade granola before you bake it."

If you used unsoaked cashews, your milk will keep in the refrigerator for about 5 days. The cashew milk has gone bad if it turns yellow, smells sour, or becomes more slimy in texture."
