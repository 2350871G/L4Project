Wood blades tend to have as many as 12 teeth per 1 in (2.5 cm), while metal blades can have up to 36 teeth per 1 in (2.5 cm). Fine-toothed blades work best when they\u2019re used at a slower speed so they don\u2019t break."

Feed the blade through the bottom shoe, the flat guard on the bottom of the saw, until the end fits into the quick release. Make sure the blade\u2019s teeth are facing towards the front of the saw. Push the blade into the quick release until it clicks into place. The type of connection you need depends on the model of your jigsaw. Check your jigsaw\u2019s manual to see what type of connection you need. Some quick releases have a small lever you need to turn before the blade locks in. Try pulling on the blade once you insert it to make sure it fits tight. To remove the T-connection blade, pull on the lever on the quick release and pull the blade out. Make sure your jigsaw is unplugged or disconnected from power before you change the blades."

Use at least 2 C-clamps on the edge of your work surface to hold the material sturdy. If it still moves around easily, use additional clamps or rest a heavy object on the opposite end of the material. If you need to cut a hole in the center of your material, balance it between 2 sawhorses so you can easily cut through it without damaging your work surface.

Keep the speed slow at first until you get used to using your jigsaw. Use a slower speed when you need to make accurate cuts or when you\u2019re cutting through metal. Some jigsaws have a variable-speed trigger, meaning the blade will move faster when you squeeze it harder. What Speed Should You Use? Use a slow speed setting for metal or PVC so it doesn't melt the material. Use a faster setting for wood or laminate to reduce the number of vibrations while you're cutting."

Slowly guide your saw along the curve you\u2019re cutting out, turning the back of the saw in the opposite direction of where you want the blade to go. Use a compass tool to draw the curved lines on your material to ensure you get a smooth outline. That way, as you work through the curve, the material will fall out in smaller pieces and relieve the pressure on the bladeTip: When making cutouts, cut straight relief lines in from the edge to your cut line every 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm).

Feed the saw blade one of the holes and turn it on. Follow along with the outline for the area you want to cut out towards one of the other holes you drilled. Work from hole to hole until you\u2019re finished with your cuts.
