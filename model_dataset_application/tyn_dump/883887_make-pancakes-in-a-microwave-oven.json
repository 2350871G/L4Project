It will be easier to make a lot of pancakes quickly using a plate, but a mug can give you a novel, single-serving pancake. Fill a mug about 1/4 or 1/3 full with flour or pre-prepared pancake mix. Pour water into the mug (about half a mug's worth) until the mixture becomes a paste of medium thickness. Mix with a teaspoon until the consistency is smooth. You can add more water if the mixture is too thick, and more flour/pancake mix if the mixture is too thin. Put the mug in the microwave for about 90 seconds. The pancake is fully cooked when there is no runny mixture left in the mug. If the mix is still runny, then microwave the mug for 30 seconds longer. Pour toppings directly into the mug, then eat with a fork. When your mug pancake is thoroughly cooked, it is ready to eat. Drizzle syrup, sugar, or butter into the mug, and enjoy! Serving Microwave Pancakes Put toppings on your pancake. If you have a sweet tooth, choose sugar, syrup, Nutella, and/or whipped cream. Spread your pancake with butter for a rich but simple meal. Consider ham, cheese, and other savory toppings for a heartier pancake experience. Consider microwaving bacon to accompany your pancake. To cook bacon in the microwave, lay two paper towels on a plate. Place the bacon strips across the plate and add another paper towel on top. Blast your bacon for three and a half minutes and you've got a meaty pancake topping.",
