If your stove is near an exterior wall, the fastest way is to go through the wall. Other vents have to go up through the roof. If your home has a chimney, you can often connect the vent pipe to the chimney instead of creating another hole in an exterior wall. If you have a cabinet over your stove, you may need to run the pipe behind or even through it. Cabinets are good for hiding vent pipes, but the pipe reduces your available storage space."

Also, try asking a building inspector or a contractor for more information. Joists, electrical wires, and other construction material block your vent. Although you can sometimes move these components, adjusting the vent pipe\u2019s route is usually more efficient. If you have to go through important materials in the wall, speak to a contractor to avoid damaging your home. Find a local HVAC professional with experience installing stove venting. If your wall or ceiling is open, such as during construction, try testing the route yourself. Straighten out a coat hanger, tie it to a drill, then run it through the route you chose.

A basic hood vent rests 24 to 30 in (61 to 76 cm) above a stovetop. If you\u2019re going to vent something like a wood-burning stove, you will need a longer pipe to connect directly to it. If you\u2019re installing through a finished wall, measure a nearby doorway, then add extra length for insulation and other components. For example, an average interior wall is about 4 in (10 cm) of framework plus an extra 1 in (2.5 cm), or 5 in (13 cm) thick in total. Add an extra 1 in (2.5 cm) of sheathing for an exterior wall, or about 6 in (15 cm) of thickness in total.

You don\u2019t need one if you\u2019re using a wood-burning stove or something similar that has its own exhaust pipe. Most kitchens have one for safety. Range hoods come in a variety of sizes and styles, but they all work the same way. Choose a hood that fits in the amount of wall space you have available. The range hood needs to be about 6 in (15 cm) wider than your stove, extending past it on both sides. Some homes lack space to hide ducts or are made of materials like glass that can\u2019t have duct openings. Count on needing free space 8 to 12 cm (3.1 to 4.7 in) wide for range ducts. Getting a regular range hood depends on how thick your wall is and what obstacles are in the way of an installation. If installing ducts is a problem you face, consider getting a ductless range hood that uses a filter to recirculate air."

You will need at least 1 metal pipe, usually steel or aluminum, that connects the stove vent to the outside. You may need to use multiple pipes in order to build the vent. For example, if you\u2019re venting a range hood horizontally, you will probably need 2 pipes. The first pipe rests on top of the hood. The other pipe connects to it and runs horizontally towards the outside. Get a couple of pipe elbows to connect multiple vent pipes.

    "You can also use a drill bit to start the cut, then use a different saw to cut the material.",
    "Create another hole to lead the pipe outside your home.",
    "Go outside your home and drill a second hole the same way you did with the first.",
    "Make sure you know exactly where your vent pipe will lead so you don\u2019t drill a hole in the wrong place.",
    "You may also need to cut additional holes, such as when you need to run the vent through the attic to lead it outside.",
    "Be on the lookout for studs, pipes, and other obstacles.",
    "If you run into them, you will need to reroute your vent or have a contractor remove the obstacles.",
    "If you\u2019re uncertain where to create the exterior hole, you can wait until you fit the vent pipes.",
    "With careful planning, this usually isn\u2019t necessary, but accuracy makes waiting worth it.",
    "Install ductwork to connect the vent to the outside of your home.",
    "Position the pipes according to the type of hood or stove you\u2019re using as well as the route you chose.",
    "Usually, this means connecting a steel or aluminum pipe to your hood or stove first.",
    "Slide the pipes into elbow joints as needed to orient the vent in the proper direction.",
    "Wrap pieces of aluminum duct tape around each joint to secure the pipe pieces together.",
    "Use the same size pipes and elbow joints.",
    "The pipes fit inside the joints and don\u2019t need to be screwed or glued together.",
    "Fit the vent cap on the outside of the wall with silicone caulk.",
    "Lay the vent cap so it\u2019s as flat against your home as you can make it.",
    "Cut away some of the siding or roofing to get it as even with your home\u2019s surface as possible.",
    "Vent caps rest on square plates, so fitting one on your home isn\u2019t too tough.",
    "When you have it in place, spread a bead of caulk around the edge of the plate to glue it in place.",
    "The flatter the vent cap is on the wall or ceiling, the more waterproof your vent will be.",
    "Expect water to drip into any space left between your home\u2019s surface and the vent cap plate.",
    "Screw the vent cap plate to your home.",
    "The screws you need will be included with the vent cap you purchased.",
    "You will usually need 4 to 6 stainless steel screws.",
    "Fit them directly in the screw holes near the corners of the metal plate, then use a drill to secure the plate to your home.",
    "The size of the screws will vary depending on how big the plate is.",
    "Connecting a Range Hood Connect the venting system to electrical wires if needed.",
    "If you are setting up a range hood, look for the electrical wires on its back end.",
    "Twist the wires together with exposed circuit wires in the wall or a nearby junction box.",
    "Hoods generally consist of a pair of wires that you match with same-colored wires in your home.",
    "After twisting the ends of the wires together, hold them together with a wire nut.",
    "Always turn off the room\u2019s electrical power before handling wires.",
    "Flip the circuit breaker in the bottom part of your home and consider testing exposed wires with a voltmeter.",
    "What you need to do depends on your stove.",
    "Some stoves and hoods simply plug into a wall outlet, while others require electrical work.",
    "If you\u2019re unsure about handling electrical wires, call a professional electrician or a ventilation expert in your area.",
    "Let them finish the installation in a safe way.",
    "Mount the ventilation system on the wall with screws if needed.",
    "For a range hood, find the screws that came included with it.",
    "Hold the hood up to the wall, then place the screws in the corners according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
    "After tightening the screws, make sure the electrical wires and vent pipes are positioned in the wall.",
    "Some hoods rest on brackets set on the wall.",
    "Screw the bracket in place instead of the hood.",
    "You may need a friend on hand to help you lift the hood into position.",
    "Test the ventilation system to see if it works.",
    "If you installed a hood, turn the power back on to your room.",
    "Turn on the fan, light bulb, or filter features on it to ensure they work properly.",
    "No matter what type of venting you have, use the stove to make sure the vent takes smoke outside your home.",
    "If the vent doesn\u2019t work, you may need to take it apart.",
    "Try blowing air through the vents with a fan or another tool to check for leaks or loose connections.",
    "Use a voltmeter to detect if the wires have an electrical current running through them."
