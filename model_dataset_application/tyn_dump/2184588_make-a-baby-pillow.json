    "Do not sew across the  18 in (46 cm) gap.",
    "You should still backstitch when you start and finish sewing, however.",
    "For example, if you used a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance on the pillow, use a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance here.",
    "Cut notches into the seams, turn the pillowcase right-side-out, and press it.",
    "This is just like how you did the pillow base.",
    "Again, cut notches into all of the curved edges of the pillow, as close to the stitching as you can.",
    "Turn the pillow right-side-out through the 18 in (46 cm) gap, then press it flat with an iron.",
    "Use a heat setting appropriate for the fabric.",
    "If you can't iron the fabric, then skip the pressing part.",
    "Adding the Zipper Pin the zipper face down to the top edge of the gap.",
    "Take your zipper and place it face down against the right side of the fabric.",
    "Make sure that the edge of the zipper tape aligns with the raw, cut edge of the gap.",
    "Pin the two together.",
    "Sew the zipper tape to the fabric using a straight stitch.",
    "Slide the pillow onto the sewing machine's arm through the 18 in (46 cm) zipper gap.",
    "Position the top edge of the zipper tape under the sewing machine's foot, and begin to sew towards the bottom edge.",
    "If the sewing machine's arm is too thick, remove the cover to make it narrower.",
    "If you own a zipper foot, use that instead of the regular foot.",
    "Sew as close to the zipper teeth as possible.",
    "If you need to, shift the needle to the left or to the right.",
    "Backstitch when you start sewing, and remember to remove the pins.",
    "Stop when you reach the zipper pull, slide it over, then finish sewing.",
    "When you are about 4 in (10 cm) from the zipper pull, stop sewing.",
    "Push the needle down into the fabric and lift the foot.",
    "Pull the zipper pull towards the other end of the zipper tape.",
    "Push the foot back down, and finish sewing.",
    "Backstitch when you finish sewing.",
    "You will have to wriggle the zipper pull under the foot.",
    "It will take a little bit of fiddling, but you can do it!",
    "Turn the pillowcase inside-out and pin the zipper tape to the gap.",
    "Turn the pillowcase inside-out; don't worry about pushing out the corners.",
    "Find the other side of the gap, and pin the other side of the zipper tape to it.",
    "Having the zipper closed during this step will make it easier to align the zipper.",
    "Sew the other side of the zipper, stopping halfway to open the zipper.",
    "Once again, sew as close to the zipper teeth as you can.",
    "About halfway through, push the needle down through the fabric and lift the foot.",
    "Open the zipper, push the foot down, and finish sewing.",
    "You should be able to hook your fingernail over the back of the slider and move it around, even when the zipper pull is closed.",
    "Remember to backstitch and to remove the pins!",
    "Finishing the Pillow Finish the seams with pinking shears or a zigzag stitch.",
    "You don't have to do this, but it will help extend the life of your pillowcase.",
    "Trim the seams down with a pair of pinking shears, if you have them.",
    "Alternatively, go over the seams with a zigzag stitch.",
    "Another option is to use an overlock stitch or a serger.",
    "If you used a zipper foot earlier, remember to switch back to the standard foot for the zigzag stitch.",
    "Turn the pillowcase right-side-out and press it.",
    "Open up the zipper and turn the pillow right-side-out through the zipper opening.",
    "Push the seams out and press them flat with an iron once more.",
    "Again, if your fabric can't be ironed, skip the ironing step.",
    "Insert the pillow, then close the zipper.",
    "Take your pillow base and slide it into the pillowcase.",
    "Because you used smaller seam allowance for the pillowcase, the pillow base should slide in easily.",
    "Once you have the pillow in, close the zipper.",
    "Use the pillow when nursing your baby.",
    "Babies do not need sleeping pillows until they are at least 2 years old, so do not use this pillow in your baby's crib.",
    "Instead, use this pillow to support your baby while nursing.",
    "Never leave the baby unattended with the pillow."
