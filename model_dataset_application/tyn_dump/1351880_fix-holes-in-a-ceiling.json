Safety goggles are better than safety glasses because they fully wrap around your eyes and don\u2019t let anything in. Drywall dust can cause respiratory problems if inhaled, so always wear a dust mask when cutting and repairing drywall.

This will give it 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of extra length and width on each side so it can adhere to the ceiling around the hole. Drywall repair patches are made of a type of closely-woven mesh.

Run your hand over the patch as you go to feel for any rough spots and then sand those areas further until the whole patch is smooth.

Give the whole ceiling a new coat of paint if you don't have paint of the same color to use on the patch. For example, if the ceiling is white, it would be fairly easy to just apply a white coat of paint to the patch and not repaint the whole ceiling. However, if the ceiling is a different color and you don't have any leftover paint that matches it lying around, you're probably better off repainting the whole thing."

    "The dust mask and goggles will ensure you don\u2019t inhale dust from drywall or spackle or get it in your eyes.",
    "Make sure you use goggles rather than regular safety glasses.",
    "Since you\u2019ll be looking straight up at the ceiling while you sand, it\u2019s better to have protection that wraps completely around your eyes.",
    "Use a sturdy step ladder to reach the ceiling while you are sanding and spackling.",
    "Use a putty knife to apply a thin layer of spackle over the patch.",
    "Scoop up some spackle on the edge of a putty knife.",
    "Drag it across the patch to cover it, overlapping the spackle onto the surrounding wall by about 2 in (5.1 cm).",
    "Scoop more spackle onto your putty knife as needed and keep applying it until you have covered the patch evenly.Tip: If you prefer, you can use joint compound, also known as drywall mud, instead of spackle.",
    "The advantage of spackle is that it dries faster and shrinks less, making it ideal for filling in and patching holes.",
    "Make sure you press spackle down into all the holes in a mesh drywall patch or into the seams between a drywall patch and the ceiling around it.",
    "Let the first coat of spackle dry overnight.",
    "Spackle is typically dry after 2-4 hours, but drying times vary depending on conditions.",
    "Leave the first coat to dry overnight to be sure it is completely cured before you proceed to sand it and add another coat.",
    "If you don\u2019t let the spackle dry completely before proceeding with the process, moisture can get trapped inside and cause the patch to fall apart over time.",
    "Sand the patch with 120-grit sandpaper to smooth it out.",
    "Put a piece of 120-grit sandpaper on a sanding block or just sand by hand.",
    "Sand the entire patch down lightly until it is evenly smooth.",
    "Sand very lightly around the edges where the patch overlaps with the surrounding ceiling to blend the spackle in with the rest of the ceiling.",
    "Run your hand over the patch as you go to feel for any rough spots and then sand those areas further until the whole patch is smooth.",
    "Don\u2019t sand too aggressively or you might end up removing the first layer of spackle, just try to make it uniformly smooth and blend it in with the texture of the ceiling.",
    "Wipe the patch with a dampened rag to remove dust.",
    "Wet a clean cloth and wring out the excess water.",
    "Wipe down the patch after sanding to get rid of any spackle dust.",
    "This will help the second coat of spackle adhere better.",
    "You could also use a tack cloth or microfiber cloth if you have one handy.",
    "Apply and sand a second coat of spackle using the same technique.",
    "Use your putty knife to spread another thin coat of spackle over the patch, dragging the knife across it to spread it out and blend the edges into the ceiling.",
    "Let it dry overnight, then sand it smooth with 120-grit sandpaper and wipe it down with a damp cloth.",
    "If your ceiling is textured and you want to make the spackle match, you can dab it with a sponge while it is still wet and skip the sanding.",
    "You could also roll on a final coat of watered-down spackle with a textured paint roller.",
    "Prime the patch with a water-based primer.",
    "Use a paintbrush or small paint roller to apply 1 coat of water-based primer to the patch to cover the spackle.",
    "Allow the primer to dry for 3 hours before proceeding to paint over it.",
    "Most water-based primers will actually dry in 30 minutes to 1 hour, but let it dry for at least 3 just to make sure it is 100% dry before you paint over it.",
    "Paint over the patch to make it match the rest of the ceiling.",
    "Paint over the patch with paint that is the same color as the rest of the ceiling to make it blend in if you have some of the right paint color.",
    "Give the whole ceiling a new coat of paint if you don't have paint of the same color to use on the patch.",
    "For example, if the ceiling is white, it would be fairly easy to just apply a white coat of paint to the patch and not repaint the whole ceiling.",
    "However, if the ceiling is a different color and you don't have any leftover paint that matches it lying around, you're probably better off repainting the whole thing."
