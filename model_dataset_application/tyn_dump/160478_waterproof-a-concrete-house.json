They have the advantage of being quick to apply and are relatively low in cost. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how to apply. The disadvantage of liquid membranes is that they don't offer even coverage. Even if you shoot for 60 mm of coverage, the minimum recommended thickness, it's hard to achieve that consistently."

          "description":"Self-adhering sheet membranes are large, rubberized asphalt membranes that you peel and place directly onto the concrete. Sheet membranes boast even thickness, but are more expensive (in both parts and labor) than liquid membranes, and can take some time getting used to. Self-adhering sheet membranes are extremely sticky. You need to be very diligent about peeling the membrane to expose the sticky side, because it will stick to anything it comes in contact with, and it's virtually impossible to un-stick it once it is laid. Be sure to pay special attention to how sheet membranes overlap, as improper installation can result in the possibility for leakage. Make sure that lap joints are properly cut and that a bead of mastic is run down every lap joint that's spaced within one foot of a corner. Sheet membranes need at least two people to install. Installing them by yourself is a sure recipe for a poor job and create a lot of needless frustration for yourself."

For a stucco-like finish, an EIFS finish coat can be applied directly to the concrete, filling any voids, floating out minor irregularities, and creating a good moisture resistant surface. EIFS are applied with a trowel, and comes in 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets premixed and tinted to your preferred color. Float it off with a Styrofoam block or rubber float to create a uniform surface and texture. Other EIFS products may be sprayed, brushed, or rolled on with a paint roller."

Mix them with an acrylic additive for a better bond, and then apply with a long-handled brush for ease. The one downside to cementitious waterproofing is that it doesn't have any elasticity, making it prone to cracking over longer periods of time."
