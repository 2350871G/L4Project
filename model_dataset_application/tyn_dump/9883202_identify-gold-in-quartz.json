          "description":"Real gold is very heavy. If you have a piece of quartz with pieces of what you think is gold inside it, try weighing it and compare the weight with a similarly sized piece of quartz. If the quartz with gold pieces in it weighs several grams more than a similarly sized piece of quartz, it's possible that your quartz contains real gold. Real gold weighs about 1.5 times more than fool's gold, or iron pyrite. Fool's gold and other minerals that look like gold will not produce a weight difference between the pieces of quartz. In fact, the piece with gold-colored particles inside may even be lighter than your other piece of quartz if the gold is not real."

Hold a strong magnet up to the gold-colored material in your piece of quartz. If your rock sticks to the magnet, it is iron pyrite and not real gold. Refrigerator magnets may not be strong enough for the gold test. Purchase a stronger magnet, or earth magnet, at a home improvement store."

If your piece of quartz has a corner or edge that looks like gold on it, try scratching this against a piece of glass. If it leaves a scratch, it is not real gold. You can use any piece of broken glass or mirror for this test. Just be sure to use something that you don't mind scratching."

Most ceramic dishes are glazed, so they won't work for testing the gold."

          "description":"If you don't mind destroying the quartz, you can find out if you have gold in your quartz by doing an acid test. Place your quartz in a glass jar and cover it completely with white vinegar. The acid in the vinegar will dissolve the quartz crystals in several hours, leaving only bits of quartz attached to the gold. Real gold will not be affected by the acid, but other gold-look alike materials will dissolve or become damaged. You can use more potent acids which may work faster, but these would require extra caution and safety measures. Vinegar is a safe acid to use at home."

Other lighter particles of quartz will rise to the top. Empty the water with lighter quartz powders into a different container by tipping the gold pan slightly and set this aside to dispose of later. You may have to repeat this step multiple times to get the gold to settle at the bottom. Have patience! If the gold-colored dust never settles to the bottom, and instead rises to the top of the gold pan with the other quartz powder, unfortunately it was not real gold to begin with."

If you have other pieces of black sand in the bottom of your pan mixed with your gold dust, use a strong magnet to separate those out from the gold before putting the gold into a vial."
