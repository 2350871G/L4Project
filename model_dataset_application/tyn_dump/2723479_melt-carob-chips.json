The oil will remove the graininess from the carob and produce a smoother, more chocolate-like mixture. You can whisk in another 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oil if necessary to make the melted carob easier to pour or drizzle. You can also stir in 1 ounce (28 g) of paramount crystals in place of the oil. Paramount crystals are a combination of palm kernel oil and soy lecithin, and they're used to thin out chocolate and candy coatings and make them creamier."
