  "text":" Propagation and Preparing the Planting Container Find a healthy succulent leaf. Make sure it is not mushy and half decomposed. Look under succulent plants for fallen leaves. Wiggle and pull one off a plant if there are none on the ground. Find a cardboard tray, eggshell carton, a container to temporary use until the succulent is ready to be transplanted. If using a container, the lid does not need to be used. Fill your planting container with soil. If the soil is already moist, add a little bit of water. If the soil is dry, make sure it is moist before planting. Planting the Succulent (Indoors) Place the succulent on top of the soil.  Spray the soil around the succulent and spray the end of the succulent that was torn off the plant. Rainwater or tap water is good for watering. Find a good, location out of the sun for the planting container. If the planting container is in a spot with some sunlight, that's ok; just make sure the sunlight isn't too strong or the propagated succulent could get sunburned and die. Spray the end of the succulent that was torn off every day. Spray the soil whenever it's dry. Growing the Succulent As soon as the succulent has grown roots, dig a shallow hole to fit the roots and plant the succulent. Succulents grow at their own pace, but some will root really quickly.
