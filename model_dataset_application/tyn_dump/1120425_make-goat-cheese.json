  "text":" Heating and Flavoring Your Milk Place your milk over medium heat. Measure your milk into a saucepan. Place it on the stove over medium heat. Heat the milk until 180 degrees Fahrenheit (87 degrees Celsius). Stir the milk frequently to make sure it heats evenly throughout. You need a thermometer to measure the milk's heat. Add the vinegar and lemon juice. Pour the vinegar and lemon juice into the milk. Use a spoon to stir the mixture together a couple of times. The ingredients should be just combined. Cultivating Your Cheese Line a colander with a cheesecloth. Take a colander big enough to contain your milk mixture. Line it with cheesecloth so cheesecloth covers all the sides of the container.
