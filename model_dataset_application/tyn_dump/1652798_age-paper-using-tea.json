          "description":"The amount of tea you use depends on whether you want to dye your paper a lot or a little. For most projects, 1 tea bag per sheet of paper should be plenty, but if you're just going to do a few splotches of tea, you might be able to use one bag for several sheets of paper. However, if you're planning to fully saturate the paper and you want a very dark finish, you might need 2 tea bags for each sheet. Tip: Any type of tea will work, but black tea is a common option for this project. However, you might want to avoid using green tea or tea infused with red herbs, as this will produce a different color effect and the paper might not look aged. If you use a cup that isn't intended for hot beverages, you could end up with a nasty burn. Stick to a coffee or tea cup, and avoid cups made from plastic or metal, as they aren't meant to hold boiling water."

          "description":"You only need enough water to fill up a mug, or about 1 cup (240 mL), but since water evaporates as it boils, it's better to start with more than you'll need. If you'll be brewing multiple mugs of tea at the same time, make sure you have enough water for each mug."

          "description":"In order to extract the tea from the bag, the water needs to be as hot as possible. If you're using a pot, you'll see bubbles on the surface of the water when it's boiling. If you're using a tea kettle, you'll hear a high-pitched whistle when the water is ready. Be very careful when you're working with boiling water. If the pot you're using has a metal handle, use a pot holder to move it so you don't burn yourself, and be very careful not to spill any on your skin. If you're a kid, ask an adult to help you boil the water for this step. You can also boil the water in the microwave if you like, but be sure to use a microwave-safe dish and place a non-metallic object like a popsicle stick into the dish so the water doesn't become super-heated and explode."

Wait about 5 minutes for the tea to brew, or until the water turns the color you want. Try to leave about 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of space at the top of the mug. If you're trying to get a very dark color, use 2 tea bags in the mug at the same time. If you want a lighter color, 1 bag will be fine."

          "description":"Once you stain the paper, it won't accept ink evenly, so anything you try to write or print on it will look messy. It's best to write, print, or draw whatever you'd like on the paper before you do anything else. Let the ink dry completely so it doesn\u2019t run. Any paper will work for this, from plain white copy paper to heavier paper used for painting. Thicker papers might produce a lighter result that takes longer to dry. Some inks are more likely to run when they're wet, especially if you write with a washable marker or you print your design on an inkjet printer. If you can, use a laser printer or some sort of waterproof ink. If you can't, just try not to rub the paper when you add the tea. Hopefully this will minimize the smudging. If you like, you can also lightly crumple the paper, then smooth it out. This will make the paper look like it's been shuffled around for a number of years. To make the paper look even more worn, like for an old treasure map, tear off the edges of the paper."

For instance, if you're using an 8.5 in \u00d7 11 in (22 cm \u00d7 28 cm) sheet of paper, a 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) baking sheet would be perfect. Tea can stain your countertop or table, so it's important to protect your work surface. If you don't have a baking sheet that you can use, you can lay trash bags flat on your work surface instead."

If the tea bag starts to dry out, dip it in the mug of tea to wet it again. It's up to you whether you want to cover the whole page or just a few areas. Either way, don't worry about getting a perfect application. The paper will look more authentic if the yellowing is a little uneven. Experiment with ways to get the tea on the paper. If you like, you can use a paintbrush, a straw, or even your fingers to create different effects."

Rub the coffee grounds into the tea to help them stick to the paper. Loose tea leaves may work for this as well, but the effect will not be as dramatic. You can even break open one of the tea bags if you want. You'll remove the excess coffee grounds after the paper is dry."

If you bake the paper too quickly, however, it will become brittle, and it may even scorch, so it's important to use the lowest heat possible. Tip: On most ovens, this is about 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C). If you have a \"Warm\" setting, use that."

Keep a close eye on the paper while it's in the oven, however, since paper is highly flammable. If you used too much liquid, or if the paper is very thick, you might need to leave it in for a little longer. You can tell the paper is dry when the edges start to curl up. Use oven mitts to protect your hands when you take the baking sheet out of the oven."

If you need it to look like it's been damaged, try crumpling the paper, singing it with a flame, or adding more stains or tears. For instance, if you're making an old treasure map, you might want to crumple it up and carefully burn the edges so it will look old and worn. If you want to create holes in the paper, crumple the sheet and spritz it with a little water, then use your fingernails to make small tears. Allow the paper to air dry."
