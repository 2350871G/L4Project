Use colored wrapping paper, ribbons, stickers, and sequins to decorate the outside of your container before you start arranging your cake pops in it. For example, for a wedding or bridal shower, you could decorate the box in white paper with a soft white, pink, or blue ribbon. For a birthday party, paper the box in bright birthday wrapping paper and tie a colorful bow around the outside to look like a present."

          "description":"Floral foam is a lighter material, similar to Styrofoam but not packed as tightly. This makes it easier to place your cake pops in, and gives them more support as well. If you can't find floral foam, though, you can still use Styrofoam in a pinch. You can find floral foam in craft supply stores. Look for \u201cdry foam,\u201d which is often used to display silk flowers."

Spread them out across the surface for a neat, natural look. Then, set them out on a table for your guests to enjoy! You can place the pops in neat rows or space them out randomly. Avoid handling the cake pop by the cake part. You might accidentally crack or squish it."
