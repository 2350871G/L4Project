Hold the fin up with your fingers and make your cut as close the fish\u2019s body as you can. Throw the fins in the trash as you cut them off. Leave the tail on the bream. You can cut a little off the end if you want to make it look cleaner, but it\u2019s not necessary. Use caution as you cut the dorsal, or top, fin of the bream since it is spiny."

Pan-Fried Sea Bream Cut the fillets off of the fish. Cut off the bream\u2019s head just below the gills using a chef\u2019s knife and throw it in the trash. Slice along the fish\u2019s backbone from the head to the tail to remove the fillet from one side. Flip the fish over and cut the second fillet from the other side.

Remove as much of the yellow skin from the lemon as you can to give your fish the most flavor. Squeeze a little bit of the lemon juice into the zest if you want a citrusy fish. Rub the fillets with the lemon zest and half the parsley. Coat the meat of the fillets with the lemon zest and the parsley. Spread it out evenly across the meat so the fillets have a consistent flavor. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil into the skillet. Coat the entire bottom of the pan with the oil and heat it until it starts to bubble. You can replace olive oil with any other cooking oil if you need to. Cook the fillets skin-side down for 2 minutes. Set the fillets in the middle of the pan and let them cook until the skin is crispy. Don\u2019t move the fillets while they cooking, otherwise the skin may not crisp evenly. Flip the fillets and cook the other side for 1 minute. Shimmy a spatula underneath the fillets and flip them over. Let the meat of the fillets sear for 1 minute. Once they\u2019re finished, set them aside on a warm plate. Cooking the meat of the fillets will seal in the lemon and parsley flavors. Drain the excess oil and add the white wine to the pan. Remove the oil from the pan and pour in 4 tablespoons (59 ml) of white wine. Simmer the white wine over low heat in the pan to remove the alcohol. Reduce the wine to 2 tablespoons (30 ml) to make the base for your sauce. Let the alcohol cook off, or else your sauce will be boozy. Add the butter and remaining parsley while the wine reduces. Cut the butter into cubes so it melts faster in the pan. Stir the butter into the reduced wine and add the other half of the parsley. Continue mixing the sauce until the butter melts completely. Serve the sea bream while it\u2019s still hot. Put the bream fillets on a serving plate and drizzle the sauce over them. Warm the plate beforehand so they don\u2019t drop in temperature.
