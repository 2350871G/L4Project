Put pressure on this to pull the interior trim away from the wall, removing it slowly so you can deal with any caulk, paint or glue that might still be present. There may be staples holding the top piece of trim to the side pieces as well. Repeat the same steps on the exterior trim. Don\u2019t skip cutting the caulk. If you pry the trim away without cutting the caulk first, you risk damaging the wall. Set the trim aside. You\u2019ll need to re-attach it once the door has been installed."

The doors are heavy, so should be removed one at a time. Each section of the door can weigh about 100 pounds (45 kg). If you\u2019re not comfortable lifting that much on your own, ask a friend to help you with the door removal and installation process. If you notice the bottom rollers are hanging up as you lift the door, get an assistant to pry them up gently as you move the door up and out."

          "description":"Once the trim has been removed, you can remove any nails that are left behind. Then, use a screwdriver to remove the screws which hold the frame of the sliding door to the wooden door frame. Remove screws on the left, right, top, and bottom sides of the sliding door. Although you can use any screwdriver for this step, it\u2019ll be more efficient to use an electric screwdriver. If the door is older, its screws may be stripped or caked with paint or caulk, making them difficult to remove with a screwdriver. Instead, have someone hold the door to stop it from falling while you use a reciprocating saw with a bimetal blade to cut between the door frame and the framing and quickly slice through any screws and nails."

Glass door frames can be made of various materials, including wood, vinyl, or aluminum. The material and quality of the door will determine its cost. A simple 6 feet (1.8 m) glass door will cost around $300. A pre-hung glass door (which is the easiest type to install) will range between $1,000 and $4,000 USD. Pre-hung sliding glass doors can be installed as a single unit. You won\u2019t need to assemble the frame before installing it in your wall."
