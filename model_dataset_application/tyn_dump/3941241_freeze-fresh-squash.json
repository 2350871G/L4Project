If you're using a knife, hold the squash upright on your cutting board and slice downwards, removing the squash\u2019s skin. Once you\u2019ve finished one section with the vegetable peeler, rotate the squash in your non-dominant hand to peel another side. With a knife, slice just beneath the skin on one side of the squash.

    "Puree the cooked squash.",
    "A puree of winter squash will hold up well in the freezer for many months.",
    "Use a blender or a food processor to puree the winter squash until all of the lumps are gone.",
    "Cooking will have softened the squash to make this step rather easy.",
    "Alternatively, you can mash the squash with a mashing tool or even a run of the mill metal fork to achieve a similar effect.",
    "Portion and freeze small amounts of the pureed squash.",
    "Wait for the squash to cool, then portion out \u20442 cup (120 mL) balls of the puree, placing them on a parchment-covered baking sheet or in an ice cube tray or muffin tin.",
    "Pop the tray or tin in the freezer and let the pureed squash freeze for at least four hours, or until frozen solid.",
    "Pureed squash will freeze best if it\u2019s frozen in small portions, but if you\u2019re in a rush, you can skip this step and transfer the puree to long-term storage immediately.",
    "Transfer the pureed squash to the freezer for up to 3 months.",
    "Once the smaller portions are frozen solid, spoon them into freezer-safe plastic containers or plastic bags.",
    "Place the containers of squash in your freezer and save until they\u2019re ready to use.",
    "If you\u2019re using plastic bags, remove as much air as possible from the bags before you seal them.",
    "Defrost the puree for baking or cooking.",
    "Place the puree in the refrigerator overnight to thaw it, or set it out on the counter for 3-4 hours to defrost it.",
    "You can then microwave the puree or heat it on the stovetop to add it to warm dishes.",
    "You can also add it directly to soups and chilis.",
    "Winter squash puree is a great candidate for adding to sauces, soups, dips, lasagnas, enchiladas, and baked breads or muffins.",
    "Blanching and Freezing Summer Squash Cut the squash into rounds \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) thick.",
    "Use a sharp, heavy kitchen knife to slice off both ends of the squash, then slice your summer squash into the thin rounds.",
    "Move lengthwise down the squash, slicing every \u20444 inch (0.64 cm).",
    "If you are freezing zucchini to make zucchini bread in the future, you should grate it instead.",
    "Use a box grater to grate the zucchini into a bowl.",
    "There is no need to peel the squash first in this method, as you are going to blanch it.",
    "Boil 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water per 1 pound (16 oz) of summer squash.",
    "Use a large stockpot over high heat.",
    "Place a wire basket or metal steamer into the stockpot.",
    "The wire basket should dip down into the water so that the squash will be completely immersed in the boiling water.",
    "You are not steaming the squash in this method.",
    "Instead, you are using the wire basket as a way to easily fish the squash out of the water when ready.",
    "Put the squash into a wire basket and blanch them for 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "Place no more than 1 lb (450 g) of squash in the boiling water at a time.",
    "Cook for roughly 3 minutes.",
    "After the pieces of squash are done, remove the squash from the stockpot using the wire basket.",
    "You can poke the squash with a fork after 3 minutes to check for tenderness.",
    "If the squash feel tender, they are ready.",
    "If you are working with grated zucchini, blanch the grated pieces in small batches for 1 to 2 minutes each, until they feel tender.",
    "Dunk the squash in cold water or a bowl of ice for another 3 minutes.",
    "If you\u2019re using a bowl of ice, make sure you have about 1 pound (16 oz) of ice to 1 pound (16 oz) of vegetables.",
    "If you\u2019re using liquid water, run cold tap water continuously over the squash or change it frequently so it stays cold.",
    "Ideally, the water should be 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) or below.",
    "Dunking the squash in ice water after you have blanched it will stop the cooking process, thereby preventing the enzymes from breaking down any further.",
    "As a result, you are left with squash that retains its color, flavor, and most of its texture.",
    "Drain the squash to remove any excess water.",
    "Pour the ice bucket filled with squash through a colander (or any kind of strainer) to remove excess water from the squash.",
    "This will prepare the squash for freezing.",
    "Pat the pieces dry with a paper towel after draining.",
    "You can sandwich the squash between two paper towels for about 10 minutes to make sure they have dried completely.",
    "Freeze the blanched squash in a plastic bag for up to 6 months.",
    "Fill freezer-safe plastic containers or plastic bags with the squash.",
    "If using plastic bags, you can try to push as much air as possible out of the bag before sealing.",
    "Place the containers of squash in the freezer.",
    "Keep them there until you are ready to use them.",
    "Blanched summer squash will usually stay good in a freezer for up to 6 months.",
    "Defrost the squash and use it for cooking or baking.",
    "Place the summer squash in the fridge overnight to thaw it out, or place it on the counter for 3-4 hours to defrost it.",
    "Then, use your frozen summer squash in pasta sauces, soups, casseroles, or as a side dish.",
    "Grated zucchini will work very well in risotto, soup, muffin batter, or cake batter.",
    "As a totally stand alone dish, grated squash can be saut\u00e9ed in brown butter with garlic and sage."
