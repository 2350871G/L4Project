Set the line rather high to clear weeds and other obstructions. Keep moving one stake until the line level on the string reads level. This may be diagonally across your slope - this is fine, just stagger your swales so that runoff can't get by. You may want to construct a simple A-frame, a leveling device that will show you the contour as well."

      "description":"The trench can be as deep as you need - 1' is about average, less if you don't plan on filling it in with anything. Loosen the dirt with a pick. Shovel it out with a half-length snub-nosed transfer shovel. All the loose dirt goes on the downhill side of the swale, heaped up into what is called a \"berm.\" It acts as a retaining wall and holds water back that fills the swale. It also makes a great planting bed, as the dirt is tilled and mounded up with little competition nearby, and copious water. Planting the berm will stabilize the new soil."

Get the board level, then look beneath it to gauge where in your trench you need to go a little deeper. Rather than dig with a pick here, it's much better to scrape the bottom with a square-edged shovel to get it nice and flat. Once this area is done, move the board further down the trench and continue, until the entire bottom of the trench is straight across and level. Don't worry about absolute perfection here - just do the best you can. Keep in mind, rotting swale material, and any movement of berm dirt will lump up the bottom and throw it off - so perfection won't last anyway. You can also crack the bottom of the swale with a spading fork to aid in percolation:"
