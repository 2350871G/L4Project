          "description":"Before starting your cleaning routine, use a grill brush to scrub any leftover residue from the grill. A good grill brush has wire bristles that will remove any burnt food and some of the rust. To get off more residue, preheat up the grill for 15 minutes before scrubbing it. This will loosen any leftover food and grease and make it easier to remove. Turn the grill and then start scrubbing while it\u2019s still hot."

          "description":"Get a bucket large enough to fit your grill grates. Then pour in some hot water until the bucket is almost full. Add in 1 cup (240 mL) of dish soap and \u20444 cup (59 mL) of baking soda. Baking soda is a mild abrasive, so it will do a great job getting that rust off your grill. Mix it together until it forms a paste. You can also use vinegar with dish soap in the same way."

          "description":"If your grill grates are removable, take them off the grill and put them in your bucket. Let it soak in the baking soda mixture for at least 1 hour. This will allow the baking soda and soap to penetrate and loosen the rust. If your grill grates are too large to submerge in a bucket, just scrub the baking soda mixture on the grill with a brush. However, keep in mind this may be less effective than letting the grill grates soak, especially if there is a significant amount of rust.

    "Bridgett Price\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Co-Owner, Maid Easy\t\t\t\tConsider replacing the grates if they're badly rusted.",
    "If we're cleaning in a residence, we'll sometimes recommend replacing the grill grates altogether, especially if it's a move-in move-out clean.",
    "The grates are cheap, maybe $5-$10, so it's just an easy fix.",
    "Preventing Rust Avoid excess liquids when cooking on the grill.",
    "If you\u2019re using marinades or special sauces while cooking on your grill, avoid pouring them directly on the grill\u2019s burners.",
    "Instead, add your sauces to the food before you put it on the grill.",
    "Excess sauce can cause rusting and clogging.",
    "Clean your grill regularly.",
    "It\u2019s important to clean your grill before and after each use.",
    "To do this, use a grill brush to scrape off leftover food residue that\u2019s stuck on the grates.",
    "If you clean with soap and water, make sure to dry it off completely when you\u2019re finished.",
    "If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, clean it while it\u2019s still hot and throw away remaining ashes and coals.",
    "Oil your grill to prevent food from sticking.",
    "Oiling a grill is an important step in the grilling process.",
    "Every time you clean your grill, you\u2019ll want to coat it with oil.",
    "Dip a handful of paper towels in canola or vegetable oil and rub it on the grill grates.",
    "This not only prevents food from sticking, but it also repels moisture.",
    "Do not use an aerosol can to spray vegetable oil on the grill.",
    "They are known to explode flames.",
    "Make sure the grill lid is tight and cover it when it\u2019s not in use.",
    "To avoid moisture getting into your grill when you\u2019re not using it, make sure you close it and cover it with a nylon or vinyl cover.",
    "It should be a tight seal, especially when it\u2019s raining.",
    "Moisture is the main reason why rust forms in the first place.",
    "Move your grill indoors to keep it out of the elements.",
    "If possible, move a portable grill indoors to a garage or shed.",
    "This is especially important if you live in a cool or wet climate.",
    "Rain and snow can rust your grill and reduce its lifespan.",
    "If you live near the ocean, the salty air may corrode your grill.",
    "Make sure you clean and cover it regularly if you live in these areas."
