With your other hand, wedge the end of a shucking knife into the space where the top and bottom shells meet. Twist the knife to pop the shells apart, then use the sharp edge of the knife to cut under the meaty part of the oyster to separate it from the shell. The meaty part of the oyster is attached to the shell by its membrane. Cutting under the oyster with a sharp knife will cut through the membrane, allowing the oyster to slide out of the shell. You can discard the oyster in the trash or eat it raw immediately after opening the shell. You may want to wear protective gloves to protect your hands from the knife and the shell\u2019s sharp edges."
