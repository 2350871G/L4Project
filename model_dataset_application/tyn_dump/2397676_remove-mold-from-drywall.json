Many of these cleaners can be harmful if inhaled and, as a result, you should keep the doors and windows open as you work. Never direct a fan of any kind into the room or you will absolutely spread the spores everywhere! A fan may be placed in windows facing outward to push bad air outdoors. You should seal off doors with plastic to avoid spreading the mold spores in other areas of the house."

          "headline":"Choose a cleaning agent.",
          "description":"Cleaning agents range from mild to potent and include both natural and chemical alternatives. If you have small children or pets in your home, you may want to consider a milder, natural solution over a powerful chemical one. If you have a more advanced mold problem, a stronger chemical may be necessary. Combine one part baking soda with five parts water. Baking soda is the mildest, safest cleanser available that is commonly used against mold. Use straight vinegar or vinegar mixed in equal parts with water. Vinegar is a little stronger than baking soda but it is still natural and safe to use around children and pets. Try an unscented detergent. Since one of the easiest ways to identify the presence of mold is by smell, using an unscented detergent guarantees that no other smells will interfere with your ability to detect the smell of mold. Detergents are still relatively safe to use around kids and pets even though they are a chemical product. Combine the detergent with a small amount of water. Use bleach. Some sources recommend the use of bleach while others do not. Objections to bleach are primarily due to how harsh it is and how potentially harmful it can be to breathe in. Some also believe that its effectiveness is not reliably consistent. Nonetheless, it still remains one of the strongest cleaners effective against mold and safe for painted drywall. Mix one part bleach with three parts water."
