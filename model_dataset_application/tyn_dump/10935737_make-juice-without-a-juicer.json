This will make your juice tastier and more cohesive, and might even trick some people into thinking you're a professional! Strawberries, pineapples, and kiwis have very complementary flavors when mixed together. Carrots, beets, and apples are also tasty when blended together. Light, refreshing green produce like cucumbers, melon, pears, green apples, and leafy greens blend nicely if you want to make a green juice.Tip: You can incorporate supplementary ingredients like kale and ginger into pretty much any blend you want, depending on your personal preference."

          "description":"It\u2019s important to aim for a nice balance between sweet and savory flavors when creating juice blends. If it's too sweet, your juice might be difficult to drink quickly, while too-savory juices can be a bit off-putting. Adding kale to your juice is wonderfully healthy, but it can create a bitter taste that is off-putting to most people. To counteract this bitterness and make the flavor more palatable, add sweet fruits like pineapple and juicy apples to the mix. If you want to make a root vegetable base with carrots and beets, you can add sweet fruits like apples to balance the flavor and sweeten the mixture. This trick also works great for smoothies that are a little too tangy or sour. If you want to balance out a smoothie that's already pretty sweet, try squeezing the juice from half a lemon into the mixture. For a spicy kick that can jazz up a bland smoothie, try adding ginger."

Adding water-heavy produce like citrus fruits, tomatoes, and cucumbers will generate plenty of liquid during the juicing process and help to bring the different flavors together. If none of your produce is particularly water-heavy, just add a splash of water or unfiltered apple juice to the blender instead. Adding water-heavy items is particularly helpful if you're using a regular blender rather than a high-speed blender."

If your fruit and vegetables are organic, you can leave most of the cores and peels intact, or you can remove them\u2014just keep in mind that removing them will prolong the life of your blender! However, no matter what you choose, you should definitely remove big pits, like the ones you find in peaches, plums, and avocados. Pineapples should always be peeled and cored before juicing them. If you\u2019re using non-organic produce, it\u2019s a good idea to go ahead and remove skins and peels as you normally would. That way, harmful traces of pesticides won\u2019t make their way into your juice. Juice recipes will typically tell you to remove cores, seeds, and rinds, but it\u2019s ultimately your call.

If you don\u2019t remove peels and skins before juicing, you may need to rinse off items that you normally wouldn't rinse. For example, you typically don't need to rinse off an orange, since the peel protects the fruit inside and the peel comes off. In this case, if you aren\u2019t removing the rind, it definitely needs a quick rinse! You can use a vegetable or produce brush to be extra thorough."
