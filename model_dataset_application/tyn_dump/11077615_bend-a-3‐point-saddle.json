    "Push the end of the conduit down to create a 45-degree bend at the center line.",
    "Use your body weight to push the end of the conduit downwards over the bender head.",
    "Stop applying pressure when the bottom of the conduit lines up perfectly with the 45-degree mark on the bender head.",
    "When making a 3-point saddle, you should always create the center bend first.",
    "Squat into the bend and bend your knees as you push on the conduit.",
    "This will help you get a better look at the alignment on the bender head, and will prevent you from straining your neck or back.",
    "For a 30-60-30 saddle, push the conduit until it lines up with the 60-degree line on the bender head.",
    "Slide the conduit down the bender head and rotate it 180 degrees.",
    "This will enable you to reach the first outside mark.",
    "Move the first bend past the bender head, sliding it away from your body, until the first outside mark sits on the bender head.",
    "Then twist the conduit around 180 degrees.",
    "The center bend should be in a \u201cV\u201d shape and the long end of the conduit will be up in the air, parallel to the floor instead of pointing down at it.",
    "Don\u2019t pull the conduit out of the tool.",
    "You\u2019re not creating any bends at this point; just repositioning the conduit.",
    "Line the first outside mark up with the arrow on the bender head.",
    "While you used the notch as a reference for the center bend, you\u2019ll use the raised arrow mark as the reference for the 2 outside bends.",
    "Align your pencil mark with the arrow for the first outside mark.",
    "Use your body weight to bend the conduit at a 22.5-degree angle.",
    "Grip the short end of the conduit with your hands and push it downward, bending your knees and applying steady pressure as you create the bend.",
    "Stop when the bottom of the conduit lines up with the 22.5-degree mark along the bender head.",
    "You\u2019ll make both outside bends at opposing 22.5 degrees.",
    "For a 30-60-30 saddle, keep bending the conduit until it reaches the 30-degree line on the bender head.",
    "Lift the conduit out of the tool and line up the other outside line with the arrow.",
    "Once you\u2019ve created the center bend and the first outside bend, slip the conduit out of the bender head.",
    "Rotate it so that the bender head faces towards the center line on the conduit, rather than away from it.",
    "Slide the conduit back into the bender head so that the other outside mark lines up with the raised arrow.",
    "Keep the bent pieces angled towards the floor, with the center bend positioned like a \u201cV.\u201d Create the final bend at a 22.5-degree angle.",
    "The second outside bend should be a mirror image of the first outside bend.",
    "Once again, use your body to add steady pressure onto the end of the conduit to push it down until the bottom lines up with the 22.5-degree mark on the bender head.",
    "For a 30-60-30 saddle, make this final bend a 30-degree angle.",
    "With the 3-point saddle now complete, you\u2019ll be able to secure the conduit in place right over the obstruction."
