Alternately, you can put the brine together in a saucepan and then heat it briefly on the stovetop to draw more flavor out of the spices. This will produce enough brine for about 4 medium-sized pork chops. For larger servings, you may need to multiply the recipe."

Next, incorporate any pungent spices that you think will complement the mild notes of the pork. Seasonings like black pepper, anise, lemongrass, juniper berries and coriander seed are common additions to a brine, but you\u2019re free to experiment with whatever flavorings you want. Use a conservative amount of each spice, no more than about 1tbsp (roughly 10-20g)\u2014you don\u2019t want to them to overpower the chops."
