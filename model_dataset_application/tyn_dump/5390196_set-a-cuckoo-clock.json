Cuckoo clocks are always shipped and sold with a lot of packing material to keep the carefully-constructed ornaments and face from breaking during travel. Move any packaging aside. Grab the roof of the clock where it sticks out by the side and carefully lift the clock out of the box. Lifting the clock by the roof ensures that you don\u2019t accidentally rip an ornament or fixture off of the clock. Set the weights and pendulum aside. These are almost always a leaf and 2-3 acorns. These are the pieces that hang down from your clock. They\u2019re installed after you\u2019ve mounted the clock though."

Some cuckoo clocks don\u2019t have a latch keeping the back panel in place. If you don\u2019t see a latch, look for a little indentation that you can stick your finger in.

Lift the tissue paper out carefully. Remove any flags or papers labelled \u201cremove\u201d or \u201cpull out.\u201d These flags and papers are slid in between mechanical gears to keep them from moving during shipment. Real cuckoo clocks use weights and gravity to turn the gears inside of the clock. The flags and papers help keep the gears from turning as the clock is moved or shipped. If there is a piece of cardboard under the drum inside of your clock, slide it out. The drum looks like a little coil with a platform. Do not remove the packaging underneath your clock.

If your cuckoo clock feels really light when you lift it, like less than 1\u20133 pounds (450\u20131,360 g), it probably requires batteries to run. Mechanical clocks tend to have a little more weight to them. Most cuckoo clocks that are made of wood are mechanical. If your clock is made of plastic, this may be another sign that it runs on batteries. Sometimes, the battery packs to put your batteries in will be on the outside of the clock on the back or bottom."

    "Adjust your clock by hand to ensure that the back is flush against the wall and the clock is level.",
    "Take the chains down once the cuckoo clock is mounted.",
    "With your clock on the wall, carefully reach under the clock and undo any rubber bands or tape on the packaging.",
    "The chains must be unpackaged with the clock on the wall.",
    "Unwrap the paper to release your clock\u2019s chains.",
    "Let them hang down freely.",
    "These chains are connected to gears inside of the clock, and if you undo the packaging with the clock unmounted, they may pull on the gears or slide inside of the clock.",
    "This could break your clock\u2019s interior components.",
    "If you have a closed cuckoo door above the face of the clock, slide it open so that the bird can pop out when the clock cuckoos.",
    "Hook the weights for the chimes and the pendulum on to the chains.",
    "With the chains hanging down, grab the weights that you set aside at the beginning.",
    "Inspect each end of the weights to find the loops.",
    "Then, inspect the front chains and find the end with a hook on it.",
    "Slide the hook around the loop on the weight and let it hang down freely.",
    "Repeat this process on the other weight.",
    "Hook the pendulum on the chain or panel in the back of the clock.",
    "The weight for the pendulum is usually a leaf, while the weights for the chimes are almost always pinecones.",
    "Some cuckoo clocks have 3 weights.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about the weights pulling the clock down.",
    "They\u2019re designed to be mounted like this!",
    "Setting the Time Pull the lever on the side of the clock to lift the silencer if there is one.",
    "Look on the sides of your clock for a little latch or switch.",
    "If there is one, flip it or slide it in the opposite direction to unlock the silencer inside of your clock.",
    "If you ever want your clock to stop making noise, return this latch or switch to its original position.",
    "Most cuckoo clocks do not have this feature.",
    "If you don\u2019t see a slide or a latch, don\u2019t worry about this step.",
    "Move the minute hand clockwise until your clock cuckoos.",
    "Put your index finger on the top of the minute hand.",
    "Slowly and carefully, turn it clockwise until your clock makes its cuckoo noise.",
    "The minute hand is the only piece you need to set the time and turn the clock on.Warning: Do not turn the hour hand, as this may break an important gear inside of your clock.",
    "The cuckoo noise should either be triggered at the 30-minute mark or the 0-minute mark.",
    "If your clock doesn\u2019t cuckoo, you either missed a latch for the silencer on the side, or your clock requires batteries and you didn\u2019t see the battery holder.",
    "In either case, consult your instruction manual to determine what you missed.",
    "Continue turning the minute hand clockwise until the time is right.",
    "Once the clock has cuckooed once, it is triggered to begin operating and you can set the time.",
    "To do this, turn the minute hand clockwise.",
    "The hour hand will move with the minute hand as you turn it.",
    "Continue turning the minute hand until the time is accurate.Warning: Do not turn the minute hand counterclockwise if you accidentally pass your desired time.",
    "This can cause the clock to break.",
    "It\u2019s really easy to set the time on the cuckoo clock.",
    "You simply turn the minute hand until it reads the correct time.",
    "If you ever forget to rewind your clock and the clock stops running, this is how you\u2019ll reset the time.",
    "Rewind your clock periodically by pulling the hooks down on the weights.",
    "Cuckoo clocks rely on gravity from the weights to turn the gears.",
    "Rewinding the clock resets the weights and gives your clock the energy to continue running.",
    "To rewind your clock, lightly tug on the end of the chain that doesn\u2019t have a weight on it.",
    "Pull the chain down until the weight is raised to the bottom of the clock.",
    "For 1-day clocks, do this daily.",
    "For 8-day clocks, the weights are lowered at a slower rate.",
    "Reset them once every 7-9 days.",
    "Never pull on the weights themselves.",
    "This can damage the gears inside of your clock."
