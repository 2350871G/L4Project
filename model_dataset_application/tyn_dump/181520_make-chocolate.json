If you like, you can also add \u00bc cup (25 g) of confectioner\u2019s sugar, \u20444 cup (59 mL) of agave syrup, or 3-6 drops of liquid stevia to lend a little more sweetness to your chocolate."

Coconut oil has a low melting point, so this should only take a few seconds. Keeping the coconut oil moving continuously at the bottom of the pot will help it liquefy faster.Tip: If possible, use stainless steel cookware to prepare your homemade chocolate (or another type of nonstick cookware that\u2019s safe to soak).
