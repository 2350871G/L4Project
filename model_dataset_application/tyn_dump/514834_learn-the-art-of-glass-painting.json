      "description":"There are 2 different types of glass paint- water-based and non-water based. Both have good range of colors and are inter mixable within their ranges. Water based paints can be diluted with water, tools are easy to clean, drying time is 20 minutes, fully dry in 2 - 3 days. Non-water based paints can be diluted with ceramic thinner, brushes can be cleaned in white spirit, drying time is 2 hours,fully dry in 8 hours."

      "headline":"Apply the paint.",
      "description":"When filling in areas between outlines with a brush, apply paint generously by puddling the paint or using a pipette. This will give a flat,stained glass effect. To get a lighter color paint,dilute with water for water-based paint or gloss varnish for the non-water based paints. Always pour paint into a palette rather than using straight from the jar. This prevents colors becoming dirty or diluted. Sponging is another way of applying glass paint,this is good for covering large areas and blending colors while wet. The first coat can also be allowed to dry,then over sponged with a second color. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cd\\/Learn-the-Art-of-Glass-Painting-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Learn-the-Art-of-Glass-Painting-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cd\\/Learn-the-Art-of-Glass-Painting-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Learn-the-Art-of-Glass-Painting-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

      "description":"You may want to protect your solvent based paint with a coat of varnish. Glass paint varnish comes in a gloss or matte finish. The gloss varnish can be used as a colorless thinner to obtain pastel shades, without affecting the transparency and depth of color. The matte varnish gives a finish like frosted glass. To add finishing touches to a project,while painting is still wet, you can use tweezers to add beads or sequins. The wet paint will act as a glue.You can also add glitter by sprinkling it over the wet paint. Well, congrats! You have mastered the art of glass painting.."
