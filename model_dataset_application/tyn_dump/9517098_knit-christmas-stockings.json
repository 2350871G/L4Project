Slip a stitch and purl to the end of the second row. Slip the first stitch onto the empty needle. Then, purl to the end of the row. Turn your work around again. Repeat this sequence until the heel measures 2.25 inches (5.7 cm). Keep working back and forth across the same row to extend the heel portion of the stocking.

After your 8th row, knit across the row. However, do not turn the work around when you reach the end of the row. Pick up 12 stitches on side of heel section.
