Hold the pineapple steady with your other hand and turn it as needed. Be careful not to pierce the bottom of the pineapple. Try using a paring knife or fillet knife to cut at the proper depth. If you plan on making only 1 fruit basket, select the pineapple half that looks best to you. Store the remaining half in the refrigerator after wrapping it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil."

Using a sharp knife, slice along the edges of the core, being careful not to cut through the bottom of the pineapple. Then, lift the core out with the tip of a knife or spoon. If possible, turn the blade as you reach the bottom edge of the core. Cut underneath it to make it easier to remove while also saving the sweeter fruit around it. If you can\u2019t remove the core right away, leave it in place. Cut up the rest of the fruit, then scoop the core out with it."

For instance, cut the pineapple chunks you removed earlier into smaller pieces about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in size. Mix all the fruit up and add it to the pineapple shell to create a colorful treat. Expect to need about 4 cups (700 g) of fruit to fill each basket. This amount will vary a little depending on the size of the pineapple and the fruit used. Add different colors to the pineapple shell to make your fruit basket stand out. Strawberries and blackberries are a few options that add contrast to pineapple chunks."

    "Use the knife to cut around the pineapple\u2019s rim.",
    "Start at the end of 1 of the diagonal cuts you made.",
    "Keep the knife behind the eyes, leaving a 1 in (2.5 cm) margin between the knife and the pineapple\u2019s skin at all times.While holding the knife vertically, slowly make a circle.",
    "Basically, you connect the ends of the other diagonal cuts to remove the inner portion of the pineapple.",
    "Keep the knife in front of the eyes around the pineapple\u2019s rim so you have plenty of space to carve out a face later.",
    "Scoop out the insides with a spoon or melon baller.",
    "Remove the quartered inner flesh 1 portion at a time.",
    "Slide the spoon around the circular cut you made, then use it to leverage out the fruit.",
    "Do this as much as needed until you can see the bottom end of the pineapple.",
    "The last bit of the core at the bottom may be a little tricky to remove.",
    "If you can\u2019t scoop it out, try cutting another \u201cX\u201d into it, then use the spoon or melon baller again.",
    "Move the pineapple chunks to a separate bowl.",
    "They are good as snacks or as part of a recipe.",
    "Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to use them.",
    "Draw a face on the pineapple with a marker if you desire.",
    "Take a quick look at the outer edges of the pineapple to see if you like any side better than the rest.",
    "Then, begin sketching a face onto the pineapple\u2019s skin.",
    "If you prefer to carve the face freehanded, skip the outline and get a knife.",
    "Choose a metallic marker, such as one with silver ink.",
    "The lighter color shows up better on a pineapple\u2019s dark skin.",
    "Carve out the face with a paring knife or another serrated blade.",
    "Orient the pineapple so the outline is in front of you.",
    "Then, cut out whatever design you want your jack-o\u2019-lantern to have.",
    "For a simple design, try making 2 triangles for eyes, then a long grin with 2 square teeth in the center.",
    "Another simple way to create a design is to use a drill to make a few holes in the skin.",
    "Place the holes where the lines meet on the pineapple\u2019s skin.",
    "Place a light source inside the pineapple.",
    "Light a small tea light or install an LED in the center of the pineapple.",
    "Set the top back on the pineapple when you\u2019re done.",
    "The light will shine through the parts you cut out, so you have a decoration ready for the holidays.",
    "If you don\u2019t plan on putting the pineapple outside right away, leave it in the refrigerator.",
    "You don\u2019t have to wrap it up.",
    "It will last at least 5 days, sometimes longer."
