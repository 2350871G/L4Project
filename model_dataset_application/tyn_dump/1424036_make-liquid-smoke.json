When the charcoal has burned and the coals are red hot, transfer the coals to the smoker. Spread out the coals on the charcoal pan and let the smoker heat up to high heat, or about 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C). Smokers typically cook foods at a lower temperature than grills, because they are designed to cook through smoking rather than direct heat."

Pick up the chimney starter with tongs, pour the hot coals into the bowl, and spread them out under the center of the grill.

Crisscross a handful of dry twigs on top of the newspaper. Ignite the newspaper in multiple places. When the twigs are burning, add one or two small logs. When the fire is established, add a couple of larger logs to get the chimenea nice and hot. Wood fires typically reach temperatures around 500 and 600 \u00b0F (260 and 316 \u00b0C). Let those burn down so you're left with a bed of hot, glowing coals."
