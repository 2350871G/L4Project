Fold the head down and loop the twine around it so that you have a short end (2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm)) and a long end of your twine. Tie a tight knot. Continue moving down the length of the meat. Looping and tying off knots every 2 in (5.1 cm) or so. Try to create a more even thickness throughout the roast as you truss. The head of the tenderloin is a piece that hangs off the main length of the roast. It looks, in short, like a head. The head is easily distinguishable from the tail of the tenderloin. The tail-end of the roast is narrower and has no additional piece attached to it."
