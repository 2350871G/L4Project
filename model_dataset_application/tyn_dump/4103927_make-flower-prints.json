This project is best done with strong flowers as the act of pressing for printing can destroy more delicate petals. Pick several flowers, as it's likely you'll want to see which ones give the best prints, and you will possibly make a few prints that don't work so well. Some good flowers for flower prints include: Daisies, chrysanthemums, zinnia, strong roses, etc. Artificial flowers can be used if they have adequate detail and you don't mind getting paint all over them. Wash and dry them after use, so that they can be reused."

Use a canvas if you're going to create a scene or picture using the prints. Use fabric. You don't have to just use paper.
