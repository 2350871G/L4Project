Having a towel down saves you a lot of time in the future so you don't have to worry about vacuuming or extensive cleanup. Use a towel that you don't mind getting dirty or ruined. If you don't have a towel, use any old piece of material. You can also keep your drop-cloth in place by sticking tape on the ground by the edge of the wall and pressing the edge of your material into the tape. It should be noted here that this process is the same whether your window frame is metal or wood. However, if your frame is metal, stripping the paint is even more important in order to combat rust."

Be careful not to scratch the window pane here if you are getting near it. When finished, the surface doesn't need to be completely free from all traces of paint, just the majority of it. For smaller areas, use a small scraper which will be able to get into the corners and parts a large scraper cannot."

Apply it by using a scraper and spreading it on sort of like butter. Generally speaking, less is more with spackle as you don't want to put so much on that it forms a mound. You can always apply more later. You can buy spackle very cheaply from any hardware store."

Secondly, it creates a nice even surface for you to work on so you don't have to worry about finishing painting only to find the frame is bumpy. A good technique when sanding is to cup the sandpaper in your palm and gently rub the surface that you are working on. Long, smooth strokes work better than short, quick strokes."

Getting rid of these is important to make sure they don't interfere with your new coat of paint. Brush gently around the entire frame with a clean paint brush to get rid of as much debris as possible. Be sure to get into the corners as well as plenty of pieces of wood and paint can often clump up here."
