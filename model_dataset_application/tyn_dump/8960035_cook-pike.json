          "description":"After giving your grill a thorough brushing, fire it up to a high temperature (around 350\u00b0F, or 176\u00b0C). Give the racks time to heat up as you finish seasoning and preparing the pike. The hotter the grill, the better the pike will cook and the faster you'll have dinner on the table. To keep the fish from sticking, make sure your grill is as clean as possible and cook for a shorter amount of time on a high heat. You also have the option of using a grill pan, which will offer a more evenly-heated surface to get the pike consistently done throughout."

          "description":"Sprinkle a generous dash of dried dill, garlic salt or lemon pepper over the fillets, or brush on a thin coating of molasses and ground ancho chiles. Alternatively, you can marinate the pike beforehand for 3-4 hours in your favorite seafood marinade. Experiment with making your own dry rubs from a blend of ingredients like dehydrated garlic, paprika, brown sugar, coriander and anise. Drain excess marinade from the fillets before grilling. If they\u2019re too wet, they may fall apart when exposed to the heat of the grill."

Turn them once at the halfway point to make sure they cook evenly on both sides. Otherwise, leave them alone\u2014handling them too much will make them more likely to break into pieces. A good general rule of thumb is to grill fish for approximately 10 minutes for every inch of thickness. If you\u2019re using a grill pan, spread the fillets out to keep them separated."

          "description":"Grilled pike goes well with other health-conscious items like steamed broccoli, burgundy mushrooms or rice pilaf. Or you could choose a more basic presentation with sliced ripe tomatoes and corn on the cob and let the pike do most of the work. Either way, grilling is one of the most nutritious ways to serve a lean, protein-packed fish like pike. Wrap the pike fillets in aluminum foil along with hearty veggies like asparagus or new potatoes before grilling to steam a complete meal in one fast and easy step. Throw together a mixed green salad or slaw comprised of fresh seasonal root veggies to provide the finishing touches."

Dip the pike fillets into the dairy mixture, then coat both sides in flour (use two rounds of flour if you prefer crispier fish). Set the dredged fillets aside on a separate floured plate. For added flavor, season the flour mixture with spices like salt, pepper, parmesan cheese, garlic or onion powder. Batter for deep-fried pike can be made by combining about a cup of flour with the dairy ingredients and giving the fillets a preliminary dip in an egg wash."

Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it begins to sizzle. Make sure that the pan you\u2019re using is roomy enough to hold the oil and fish fillets without spilling or splattering."

Your eyes will be the best judge here. When the fillets are done to your liking, use a pair of tongs to carefully remove them from the pan and set them aside on a layer of paper towels to soak up the excess oil. If you\u2019re pan frying the fillets, don\u2019t forget to turn them over so they cook evenly on both sides. Hot oil tends to cook fish very quickly.

Some lighter fare could also include slow-simmered green beans or potato salad. Dig in while it\u2019s hot! Try serving fried pike with baked beans and toasted, buttered bread for a twist on classic fish and chips. Enjoy fried pike with savory tartar sauce or a splash of malt vinegar."
