Or, you can also follow a pattern to determine how long to make your foundation chain. Try using a bulky yarn with a size K hook, and then chain 67 to start. Keep in mind that the number of stitches you will need to chain will depend on the gauge of your yarn. To check the gauge, crochet a square that is 4\u201d by 4\u201d and then count the number of stitches required to create this length going in each direction."
