If the drilling ruined the paintwork, touch it up with a small paintbrush and a matching paint color. Using Cement Coat the inside of a small plastic bowl with oil. You can use any type of oil you want. The oil is simply there to make de-molding the mushroom cap easier. If you can't find a plastic bowl in the right shape and size, you can use a different material. Plastic is easier to use because of how flexible it is. Cut the bottom out of a plastic cup.
