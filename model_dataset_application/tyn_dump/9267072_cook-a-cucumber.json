After an hour, use an oven mitt to remove the baking dish. Transfer the cucumber strips to a plate using a spatula. Frying a Cucumber Cut a cucumber in half lengthwise using a knife. Do it over a cutting board to protect your counter or table from scratches. Scoop out the seeds from both halves of the cucumber with a spoon. Run the spoon from one end of the cucumber to the other, scooping up all the seeds and everything in the center of the cucumber along the way. When you\u2019re finished, you should have two carved out halves of the cucumber. If you\u2019re cooking with a seedless cucumber, you can skip this step. Cut the cucumber halves crosswise into \u00bc inch (0.64 cm) slices. Make sure the slices aren\u2019t any thinner or they may wilt when you fry them. Each cucumber slice should look like a tiny letter \"C.\" Mix the slices with 1 \u00bd teaspoons (7.4 mL) of salt in a large bowl. Stir the cucumber slices and salt with a spoon for one minute, or until the slices are thoroughly coated with the salt. Set the bowl of cucumber slices aside for 30 minutes. During this time the salt will draw out excess water from inside the cucumber slices, improving their texture and making them less watery. Rinse the slices under cold water in a colander and let them dry. While the water drains from the colander, blot the surface of the cucumber slices with a paper towel to dry them off. You don't want a lot of excess water when you fry them. Add 1 tablespoon (14.8 mL) of cooking oil to a skillet. Heat the skillet over high heat on a stovetop. Wait for the cooking oil to start lightly smoking. Pour the cucumber slices into the skillet. Use a spoon to stir the cucumber slices continuously in the skillet for around three to four minutes.
