Set the pan aside until the milk cools to room temperature.Did You Know? Hot cross buns are made with an enriched dough. Instead of making the dough with water, the dough gets flavor from milk, butter, and eggs. Put bread flour, salt, sugar, and yeast into a large bowl. Place 4 cups (508 g) of bread flour into a large mixing bowl along with 1 teaspoon (5 g) of salt, 6 tablespoons (75 g) of granulated sugar, and 1 1/4-ounce (7 g) package of instant (fast-action) yeast.

Slowly pour the milk and butter mixture into the well that you made in the dry ingredients without stirring. Then beat 1 egg and pour it into the middle of milk mixture. Combine the ingredients in the bowl to make a shaggy dough. Use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix the dry ingredients with the milk mixture and egg. Keep mixing so you incorporate the dry bits of flour near the sides and bottom of the bowl. The dough should be very sticky at this point. Kneading and Proving the Dough Knead the dough by hand for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle a little all-purpose flour on your work surface and put the sticky dough onto it.
