          "description":"275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C) is an average temperature for long, slow roasting. You may adjust the temperature, but don't go below 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C). Use higher temperatures to cut down on cooking time. City ham is what's commonly sold in supermarkets. They're often pre-cooked, so they won't need to spend as much time in the oven as uncooked hams. Spiral-sliced ham is basically a pre-cut type of city ham. It's also pre-cooked. The labeling on the packaging will tell you what kind of ham you have so you know how to heat it. Uncooked city hams exist, but are harder to find. They'll need to cook a bit longer than pre-cooked ham."

Leave most of it until later. When roasting half a ham, place the cut side on the pan. Baking sheets, broiler pans, and casserole dishes may also be used.

    "Pour the glaze over the fat side of the ham, using a pastry brush to spread it.",
    "Dry glazes can be patted on by hand instead.",
    "Always apply the glaze during the last 30 minutes of the ham's cooking time.",
    "You may pull the ham out halfway through that time and reapply the glaze.",
    "Roast the ham uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.",
    "After the 30 minutes are up, pull the ham back out of the oven and test it with the thermometer.",
    "At a minimum, it needs to be 155 \u00b0F (68 \u00b0C).",
    "If it was that temperature earlier, it'll be around 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C) now.",
    "Both show that the ham was cooked safely.",
    "Ham under 155 \u2109 won't be cooked all the way through and could be unsafe.",
    "Let the ham rest 20 minutes before carving.",
    "Set the ham aside.",
    "This will allow the juices to seal inside while the inner portion of the ham cooks a little further.",
    "Afterwards, the ham is ready to be carved and served.",
    "Finished."
