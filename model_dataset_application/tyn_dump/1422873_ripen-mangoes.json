          "description":"Leave the bag of mangoes on the kitchen counter overnight and check for ripeness in the morning. Mangoes wrapped in a paper bag will release ethylene, which is an odourless gas that speeds up the ripening process. Remove and use the mango when it gives off a fruity scent and yields to soft pressure, usually about a day (or less). Alternatively, you could try ripening the mangoes by covering them with onions and hay in a warm place; this method of ripening was used for ages in India. When wrapping mangoes in a paper bag or newspaper, be sure not to close the bag completely. Some air and gas needs to escape or mold and mildew might start to form. Add an apple or banana to the bag to speed up the ripening even more. Adding more ethylene-emitting fruits will increase the ethylene in the bag, giving you an even juicier mango all the quicker."

          "description":"This old wives trick hails from India, where industrious moms hid unripe mangoes in bags of uncooked rice to speed up the ripening. In Mexico, the trick is much the same, except with uncooked popcorn kernels instead of rice. The ingredients are different, but the process and the results are the same: Instead of waiting three days for your mangoes to ripen au naturel, they should be ripe within a day or two, maybe even less. The reason behind the ripening here is the same as the paper bag method: Rice or popcorn helps trap ethylene gas around the mango, resulting in a much faster ripening process. In fact, this method is so effective that you sometimes risk overripening the mango. Check every 6 or 12 hours for doneness. As long as you don't forget the mango inside the bowl of rice, you should have a wonderfully ripe mango at your disposal."

While mangoes are notoriously susceptible to spoilage, black blotches don't necessarily mean the mango is bad. In fact, it may mean the mango has more sugar content. If the black spots are especially soft, cut the mango open and look for translucent fruit. This is a sign of spoilage, and these mangoes should be thrown away. Use your senses if the mango in question has a few black spots: If it doesn't give too much, has a pleasant smell, and the skin is otherwise taut and richly-coloured, give the mango a go."
