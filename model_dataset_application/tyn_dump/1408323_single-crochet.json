Crocheting a Chain Plan the right number of chain stitches. If you are starting a piece from scratch, you'll have to make a chain before you can single crochet. First, you'll want to chain the number of single-crochet stitches you'd like to create, plus one or two, depending on which stitch you will be using in the next row. Figure out how many you need and continue. Make a slipknot. To crochet chain stitches, first tie a slip knot and poke the crochet hook through the knot. Hold the yarn and hook correctly. Hold the crochet hook in one hand, and the end of the yarn that leads back to the skein in the other. Wrap the yarn. Wrap the end of the yarn around the hook once, starting behind the hook and coming up and over until the yarn lies beneath the hook itself. Pull the yarn. Pull the hook through the slip knot, drawing the yarn you just wrapped along with it. You've just chained 1 stitch and have a new loop of yarn around the hook for making your next chain. Repeat. Repeat the process, wrapping the yarn around the hook and pulling it through the loop until you've chained the desired number of stitches. Crocheting the Second Row Chain one stitch. Turn your work. Once you've done your chain row, or a row of single crochet, you'll have to turn around and do another row. In other words, hold the hook still while you flip the chain you just made from either right to left, or left to right. Find the next stitch. Identify the second chain stitch away from your crochet hook. In other words, skip the chain stitch and go on to the first single crochet stitch. Insert the hook. Poke the hook through the top of this stitch, from front to back. Continue as described in the first section. Make one chain stitch at the end. At the end of each row, always chain 1 more stitch, turn your work, and repeat the process back across the row.",
