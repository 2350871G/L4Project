As you do, keep an ear out for your test kernels to pop -- this is your indication to start cooking. Add the sugar, salt, and corn once you hear the first test kernel pop. This is your clue that the oil is the perfect temperature. Note that you only need to wait for the first kernel to pop -- don't worry so much about the other two.
