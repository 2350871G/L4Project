          "description":"An E-Z Mender bracket is a metal bracket specifically designed for fixing leaning fence posts. Purchase 1 bracket per post if the post just has a minor lean and 2 if it is leaning drastically or has a crack or other structural damage. These brackets are available at a home improvement center, garden center, hardware store, or online. Note that this method will only work for 4 in (10 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) wooden fence posts that are driven directly into the soil. It won\u2019t work for fence posts encased in concrete or posts that are bigger, since the brackets are designed to fit around the wood. An alternative to the E-Z Mender bracket is a Post Buddy stake, which works best if the post is rotted and broken at ground level because the tip is designed to sink into the wood itself. The steps for installation are essentially the same, though a Post Buddy can also work on rotten fence posts that are set in concrete."
