    "Repeat the baking and removing moisture process until the mushrooms are totally dry.",
    "A properly dehydrated mushroom should snap apart like a cracker.",
    "Allow the mushrooms to cool.",
    "Once you have taken them out of the oven, allow the mushrooms to cool on the baking sheet.Do not place them in tupperware with a closed lid while they are still hot as the heat might cause condensation in the tupperware, thus ruining all of your efforts.",
    "Store the dried mushrooms in air-tight canisters.",
    "Once they have cooled completely, place the mushrooms in canisters with working seals.",
    "Keep the canisters in a dark, cool location until you are ready to use your mushrooms in soup, a baked pasta dish, or a yummy risotto.",
    "Drying Mushrooms Naturally Clean and slice the mushrooms.",
    "As listed above, you should only clean mushrooms with a brush or a dry towel.",
    "Don\u2019t use water, as water logging the mushrooms may cause outside mold or fungi to grow.",
    "Cut the mushrooms into slices 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.",
    "Check the weather.",
    "Try this method for preserving mushrooms only on sunny days with very low humidity.",
    "If there is too much humidity in the air, it will take much longer for the mushrooms to dry and mold may begin to grow.",
    "Find a good location for drying.",
    "Possibilities include sunny rooms, windowsills, or flat rooftops that have air circulation.",
    "Pick a spot where birds, animals, bugs, and moisture can't touch the mushrooms.",
    "Arrange the mushrooms for drying.",
    "There are two options for this.",
    "You can either lay the mushrooms on a drying rack, or you can string them up with cooking string.",
    "On a drying rack: Lay the mushrooms flat in one layer.",
    "Make sure that none of them are overlapping as they might get stuck together while drying, or may warp into weird shapes.",
    "Cover the mushrooms and drying rack in a \u2018net tent\u2019 which you can get at most kitchen supply stores.",
    "The net tent will keep the bugs away.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a net tent, you can simply use a piece of mesh fabric draped over and under the dry rack and mushrooms.",

    "It is very important that the mushrooms be absolutely dry.",

    "Slide these paper towel-mushroom layers into a paper bag.",

    "Overtime, your mushrooms will begin to dry in the freezer.",
    "This is a much slower process than the other two methods listed above, but is effective--particularly if you are not planning on using your mushrooms immediately."
