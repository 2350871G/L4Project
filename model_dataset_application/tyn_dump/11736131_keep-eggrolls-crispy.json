Once cut, wrap your fillings in another paper towel and squeeze them to wring the moisture out. If you\u2019re using any meat fillings, squeeze the moisture out with a paper towel after cooking and cutting the ingredients. The more moisture you can remove from the ingredients, the more likely the egg roll wrapper will stay dry when cooking and storing the egg rolls."

This may feel counterintuitive, but egg roll wrappers have plenty of oil built into them to begin with and adding more can lead to soggy egg rolls.Tip: This can also be relevant for homemade egg rolls. While you do need to use some oils to make them, try to keep the liquids to a minimum. If you\u2019re deep-frying them, they\u2019ll be submerged in oil anyway, so there\u2019s no need to add more."

Instead, use a pair of tongs to set the egg rolls on a raised cooling rack with a baking sheet underneath it. This way, the oils won\u2019t build up at the base of the egg roll and will drip freely to the baking sheet below. If the oils build up in the base of the wrapper, your egg rolls will only feel partially crispy and the wrapper at the bottom of each egg roll will feel soggy."

If you\u2019re storing any sauces for your egg rolls and you\u2019re putting the rolls in the fridge, do not package them together. The rolls may absorb some of the moisture from the sauces."
