Wrap the yarn around the hook, holding it taut. Pull the hook carrying the wrapped strand of yarn through the loop on your hook. With your first chain stitch you now have one loop remaining on your hook. Make sure that your stitches are the same size. If they're too tight, try relaxing your hands. If they're too loose, shorten the distance between the hand containing the yarn and the hand containing the hook.

Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front, catching it with the hook. Draw the hook through the two chain stitch loops. Wrap the yarn over hook back to front and then draw your yarn over both loops on back. If you want to use the half double stitch: start at the fourth chain stitch from the hook. Yarn over, as usual, back to front. Slip your hook under both front and back loops of your third chain stitch from the hook. Yarn over the front of the hook, and catch the yarn with your hook. Draw your hook through the two chain stitch loops (leaving you with three loops on the hook). Yarn over the hook, back to front, of course, and draw your hook through all three of the loops. If you want to use a double stitch: start at the fifth stitch of the foundation chain. Do the yarn over the hook from back to front. Slip the hook under the front and back loops of the fourth chain stitch. Yarn over the front of your hook and catch your yarn. Draw the hook through the two chain stitch loops, leaving you with three loops on the hook. Yarn over again, back to front. Slip your hook through the first two loops on the hook, leaving you with two loops on the hook. Yarn over the hook back to front and draw your hook through both loops. For the treble stitch: yarn over the hook twice. Insert your hook under the front and back loops of the fifth chain stitch from your hook. Yarn over and draw the hook through, giving you for loops on the hook. Yarn over the hook, again, and draw through the first two loops, giving you three loops on the hook. Yarn over and draw the hook through the next two loops on the hook, giving you two loops on the hook. Yarn over, again, drawing through both loops on your hook."
