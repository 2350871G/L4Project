You will need to consider how much time you want to spend on upkeep, how much money you have to spend to build the fence, and how long the fence will need to remain in its location. A wood fence is the most common. These last between 5-20 years, depending on the type of wood (cedar will last longer than pine, for example), and are they relatively inexpensive. Wood fences may be  difficult to clean, however, if they get paint on them. Vinyl fences will last much longer than a wood fence, up to a lifetime if using quality vinyl. They can come in a variety of colors that should not fade over time and are easily cleaned if they get paint on them. They are, however, slightly more expensive in terms of upfront costs. Brick is an option if you dislike the look of wood or vinyl fences, or if you feel the need for something more sturdy. You can use actual brick or you can use concrete block. The concrete block can be further covered in cobble or plaster for a \"Southwestern\" look. Concrete blocks can also be turned perpendicular to each other to create planters in your wall. Any kind of masonry construction, however, will be much more expensive than the other options, although it will last longer than wood. Growing or green fences are a great option if your city is very restrictive about permits or permits are very expensive. They are also good if you would prefer more greenery in your yard, rather than looking at a fence. You can plant Arborvitae, an evergreen shrub which grows three feet a year, put in an iron or chain fence and train ivy on it, or grow more standard hedges like holly."

  "text":" Before Building Your Fence Check neighborhood rules. Before building a fence, it will be important to determine if you are allowed to build a fence at all. Building one in an unapproved way can get you a fine and require you to tear the whole thing down. Before building, check what your local neighborhood rules or homeowner\u2019s association rules are regarding fences. If the fence will be built on a shared property line, then try talking with your neighbor to find out if they\u2019d be willing to share the cost of the fence with you. Check city codes. Cities often also have rules about building fences. You will need to check what they are before building one. Some cities require permits to build a fence of any height, some only above a certain height. Find out if you need a permit or if there are any other restrictions on your building. Obtain a permit. If you find out that you do need a permit, get one before building. These usually cost a little money and can be obtained from your local City Hall or Planning Department. Make sure to call the Digline at 811 before you start digging. Choose your materials. It is important to decide what kind of fence you want. There are many different types of materials, all with different benefits and downsides.

The distance between posts is up to you but keep in mind the normal spacing is 8 feet (2.4 m) from center to center. Mark all locations with spray paint or stake holes. Dig post holes.

Continue setting posts. Get in all the posts before moving on. Use temporary cross bracing to hold posts in place while the concrete hardens. This will take at least 24 hours. Build the Fence Measure and cut your rails. These are the boards (we recommend 2x4s) set between the posts, in a perpendicular alignment. You will attach the main boards of the fence to these rails. They should be measured and cut to fit between the posts. You will probably need two or three rails, depending on the height of your fence. Create your rail frame. Next, take a 1x4 and cut it to be the same height as the posts. Mark the spots on the board where you would like your rails to go.
