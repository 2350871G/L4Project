Since all three spices are already in finely ground forms, they should mix together without difficulty. You can skip the salt or reduce the amount if you'd prefer your seasoning blend to have less sodium. You can also change the amount of lemon peel and pepper used, but these proportions will result in a seasoning blend similar to commercially prepared versions."
