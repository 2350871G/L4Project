However, giving them a few light sweeps may help improve the paint's ability to adhere. Use 100-grit sandpaper or higher to avoid scraping up the wood underneath the paint. A sanding block with squared edges can come in handy for getting into cracks and crevices that are inaccessible with an ordinary square of sandpaper.

Many home improvement experts recommend using a brush with an angled tip to make it easier to work the new color into tight spaces.

Continue painting until you reach the bottom of the interior surface, then repeat on the opposite side. To prevent excess paint from globbing in the corners, work the paint in using the tip of your brush, then gently feather it back out again.

Paint follow-up coats the same way you did the base coat, using long, smooth strokes and moving from the inside out. After applying your topcoat, allow it to dry for at least 24 hours. Like you did with the previous coats, perform a touch test so you'll know when it's okay to rehang the door. It can take up to 2 weeks for new paint to cure completely and become resistant to dirt, smudges, and scratches, but it will be okay to put your door back up after a full day of drying."
