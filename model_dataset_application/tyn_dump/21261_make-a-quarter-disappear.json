Once you\u2019ve cut out the paper circle, erase the line you drew. This will help your circular cutout to look more natural. Use an Exacto knife if you have one to cut the circle. Keep your glass over the circle while you cut to ensure you get a nice, even circle. If you don\u2019t have an Exacto knife, you can use a pair of scissors."

  "text":" Making a Coin Disappear Under a Glass Prepare your trick. This trick involves a bit of preparation that you have to do before you perform it in front of your audience. This magic trick works by covering the top of a glass with a circular piece of paper that\u2019s the same color as the piece of paper you'll perform the trick on. Trace a circle around the rim of a clear drinking glass. Work lightly in pencil and keep the line as close as you can to the rim. You will use this circular piece of paper to cover the mouth of your glass. When you place the glass down during the trick, it will look like the glass is just upside down on top of your paper.

    "Another option is to blow into your fist and open your hand quickly.",
    "As you are doing this, you can either hide the quarter in a pocket or palm it.",
    "If you palm it, you can pull it out of someone\u2019s ear as a second part to the trick.",
    "If you aren't going to make the quarter reappear, put it in your pocket.",
    "Then you can show that it's not in your other hand.",
    "Performing a Palm Penetration Trick Get two quarters.",
    "For this trick, you need to do a little bit of prep.",
    "You may also want to use a small piece of clear double sided tape or magician\u2019s wax.",
    "In one hand, you will palm a quarter, hiding it.",
    "With your other hand, you will be showing your audience another quarter.",
    "Before going in front of your audience, place your tape or a small bit of wax in the palm of the hand you will slap the quarter with.",
    "If you are skilled and quick enough you don't need to do this.",
    "The adhesive helps the quarter stick to your palm.",
    "Explain to your audience that you will place the quarter on the top of your hand.",
    "You will then magically transfer it through your hand into a spectator's palm.",
    "As you are explaining this, ask a spectator to hold a hand out palm up.",
    "Place your \u201cempty\u201d hand, the one with the palmed quarter face down on top the spectator\u2019s hand.",
    "As you do this, tell your spectator to really push up into your hand.",
    "If you place your hand on top of your spectator\u2019s quickly and really press into it, your spectator won\u2019t feel the coin that is there.",
    "You can even grab the spectator\u2019s hand and position it with your other hand to further distract.",
    "Tell your audience that you can transfer the coin from the top of your hand into the spectator\u2019s palm.",
    "Tell your spectator to concentrate very hard and envision the quarter in your spectator\u2019s palm.",
    "Place the coin on top of your hand.",
    "You will now take the coin that the audience has been aware of and place it on the top of your hand.",
    "The other coin is already in the spectator\u2019s palm.",
    "Explain that by slapping the top of your hand hard enough, you can magically transfer the quarter through your hand into your spectator\u2019s.",
    "Transfer the coin.",
    "Slap the top of your hand quickly.",
    "You need to hit your hand hard enough that the coin will stick to the adhesive in your palm.",
    "Quickly palm the quarter and bring your hand away.",
    "Hide the quarter in your pocket so you can reveal that your hand is empty.",
    "After you reveal that the coin traveled through your hand into your spectator\u2019s palm, you can show your other hand is empty.",
    "If you are skilled enough, you don\u2019t have to use an adhesive.",
    "You can simply palm the quarter as you slap your hand down.",
    "However, this is much harder and requires plenty of practice.",
    "Reveal that the coin has passed through your hand.",
    "Slowly take your hand away from your spectator\u2019s to reveal that the quarter has magically passed through your hand.",
    "If you want, you can show that there\u2019s nothing in your other hand as well."
