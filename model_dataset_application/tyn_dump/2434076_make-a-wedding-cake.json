          "description":"Consider how many layers you want the cake to have and what shape you would like the layers to be in. Cakes are often round or square, but you may use a different shape for your cake layers. The number of people who will be at the wedding will make a big difference in how large the cake will need to be and how many layers your cake will need to have. For example, if you are having a close friends and family only wedding with about 20 people, then you can probably make a 10 in (25 cm) double layer cake and have plenty to go around. However, if there will be upwards of 150 people at the wedding, the cake will need to have several large tiers in your cake. Calculate the amount of cake batter you will need based on the number of servings. For example, if you need a cake that will serve 50 people, and 1 recipe serves 20, then plan to triple the recipe. If you are not making the cake for your own wedding, then make sure to have a discussion with the bride and groom about their wishes for the cake."

Be sure to check your cake recipe for the recommended baking temperature and then set your oven to that temperature.

Go with a recipe that will result in a dense cake if you plan to layer it. A recipe that results in a delicate cake is likely to crumble.

Spray the parchment or wax paper with non-stick cooking spray as well. Then, pour your batter into the pan. Make sure to prepare the amount of batter that you will need to fill each of your cake pans about halfway. If needed, use a spatula to spread the batter evenly in the pan. This may be necessary if the batter you are using is extra-thick. If you are baking a large cake, you may want to use a special cake pan that includes a heating core. This is a smaller pan that goes in the center of your larger one and you will also fill this pan with batter. Using a heating core will help to ensure that your cake bakes evenly."

Remove the cake and check to see if it is done when the time is up. If the cake is still raw in the center, put it back into the over for another 5 minutes and check again. Check the center of the cake by inserting a knife or toothpick down through the center. If it comes out clean, then the cake is done.

If the weather is hot, make sure to turn on the air conditioning in your car to cool it down well before you need to transport the cake to the venue. Box up the cake before moving it to your car. Placing the cake into a box will help to prevent it from getting dusty or dirty on the way to the venue. Use a clean, empty cardboard box that is big enough to fit the entire cake into. If the cake is too big to fit into a single box, or if you plan to assemble the layers when you arrive at the location, then put it into multiple boxes. For a smaller cake, you may be able to use a cake carrier or a cake box. A cake carrier is especially useful for safely transporting a cake. Check your local craft supply store for these items. Place the cake on a level surface and not on a seat. It is best to place the cake on the floor of your car to ensure that it will not tip or tile. The best place to set the cake is on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Push the seat all the way back to make room and set your boxed cake on the floor. You can place some non-slip material on the floor before putting the cake on it to help prevent the box from slipping. Drive slowly and have someone hold the cake steady during the trip. Even if you are certain that the cake is secure and will not shift during your journey, drive slowly and avoid sudden turns and stops. Take a route to the location that will allow you to do this. You should also have someone ride along with you to keep an eye on the cake, if possible. If you need to travel alone with the cake, then you might prevent the cake box from slipping around in your car by placing rolled up towels on all 4 sides of it. Place the cake in the refrigerator at the venue. When you arrive at the wedding venue with your cake, place it into a refrigerator until you are ready to serve it. This will help to ensure that the ingredients in the cake will not spoil and the decorations will be kept intact for everyone to see. If refrigeration is not an option, wait to bring the cake to the venue until just before the event. Make sure to place the cake on a sturdy surface that is located in a shady spot.",

    " Baking the Cake Layers Decide on the number and shape of the cake\u2019s layers.",
    "Consider how many layers you want the cake to have and what shape you would like the layers to be in.",
    "Cakes are often round or square, but you may use a different shape for your cake layers.",
    "The number of people who will be at the wedding will make a big difference in how large the cake will need to be and how many layers your cake will need to have.",
    "For example, if you are having a close friends and family only wedding with about 20 people, then you can probably make a 10 in (25 cm) double layer cake and have plenty to go around.",
    "However, if there will be upwards of 150 people at the wedding, the cake will need to have several large tiers in your cake.",
    "Calculate the amount of cake batter you will need based on the number of servings.",
    "For example, if you need a cake that will serve 50 people, and 1 recipe serves 20, then plan to triple the recipe.",
    "If you are not making the cake for your own wedding, then make sure to have a discussion with the bride and groom about their wishes for the cake.",
    "Preheat the oven to the temperature indicated by your cake recipe.",
    "Many cake recipes call for the oven to be pre-heated to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C), but this is not always the case.",
    "Be sure to check your cake recipe for the recommended baking temperature and then set your oven to that temperature.",
    "Pre-heating instructions are usually given at the beginning or top section of a recipe, so look there first.",
    "Prepare the cake batter according to your recipe\u2019s instructions.",
    "Choose a recipe to create the cake batter for your cake.",
    "You can make a different cake recipe for each layer, or just choose 1 recipe for the whole cake.",
    "Go with a recipe that will result in a dense cake if you plan to layer it.",
    "A recipe that results in a delicate cake is likely to crumble.",
    "Some recipes you might try include:\nVanilla Cake\nChocolate Cake\nButter Cake\nRed Velvet Poke Cake Pour the batter into a greased, parchment-lined cake pan.",
    "Spray your cake pan with non-stick cooking spray.",
    "Then, cut a piece of parchment or wax paper to fit the bottom of the pan and place it in the pan.",
    "Spray the parchment or wax paper with non-stick cooking spray as well.",
    "Then, pour your batter into the pan.",
    "Make sure to prepare the amount of batter that you will need to fill each of your cake pans about halfway.",
    "If needed, use a spatula to spread the batter evenly in the pan.",
    "This may be necessary if the batter you are using is extra-thick.",
    "If you are baking a large cake, you may want to use a special cake pan that includes a heating core.",
    "This is a smaller pan that goes in the center of your larger one and you will also fill this pan with batter.",
    "Using a heating core will help to ensure that your cake bakes evenly.",
    "Place the pan in the center rack of your oven and bake as instructed.",
    "Make sure that you check the suggested baking time on your recipe before you put the cake into the oven.",
    "Then, set a timer as soon as you put the cake in the oven.",
    "Remove the cake and check to see if it is done when the time is up.",
    "If the cake is still raw in the center, put it back into the over for another 5 minutes and check again.",
    "Check the center of the cake by inserting a knife or toothpick down through the center.",
    "If it comes out clean, then the cake is done.",
    "If it comes out with raw batter stuck onto it, then it is not done.",
    "Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool to room temperature when it is done.",
    "Repeat for the other cake layers.",
    "If you are making a multi-tiered wedding cake, then you will need to bake multiple layers.",
    "Repeat the baking process for each of the layers you want to create.",
    "You may make the layers of your cake all the same flavor, or follow a different cake recipe for each layer.",
    "Freeze your cake for 1 to 2 weeks if you are baking it in advance.",
    "This will save you time, which you will need to make the filling and frosting for the cake, and then to decorate it.",
    "Wrap the entire cooled cake in 6 layers of plastic wrap and then 2 layers of foil.",
    "Place it in your freezer and take it out a few hours before you decorate it.",
    "Keep in mind that a thicker cake will take longer to defrost, so give the cake plenty of time to fully defrost before serving.",
    "Filling and Stacking the Cake Prepare the cake filling the night before or the day of the wedding.",
    "Wedding cake fillings are often elaborate and rich, but you can also opt for simple fillings to make the process a little easier.",
    "Choose a filling that will complement your cake, such as a cherry or mint filling for a chocolate cake, or a butterscotch or strawberry filling for a vanilla cake.",
    "Keep the prepared filling in your refrigerator until you are ready to use it.",
    "Spread jam between cake layers for an easy fruit-flavored filling.",
    "If you are short on time, or simply don\u2019t want to make filling for your cake, then purchase a few jars of jam.",
    "You can use 1 flavor or do a different flavor for each layer of the cake.",
    "Use a pudding or custard mix to create a rich, creamy filling.",
    "You can buy boxes of pudding or custard mix and prepare them according to the box\u2019s instructions and use this to fill your cake.",
    "Make 1 type of pudding or custard to go between the layers, or make a different kind for each layer.",
    "Cut up fresh fruit or use a canned fruit filling.",
    "You can use fresh or canned fruit, such as premade pie fillings.",
    "Choose fresh fruit that is in season for the best flavor, or opt for a can of pie filling for something sweeter.",
    "Place the first layer on your cake drum or plate.",
    "The largest layer will go at the bottom of a multi-layer or tiered wedding cake, so start with this one.",
    "Place the layer on a cake drum or a cake plate that is large enough to hold the cake.",
    "If you have a turntable, place the cake plate or drum onto the turntable.",
    "Trim the layers to make them flat and even.",
    "Use a serrated knife to cut across the top of your cake.",
    "Crouch down and check the cake from the side to see if it is even.",
    "If possible, put the cake on a turntable while you cut it.",
    "This will allow you to rotate the cake as you cut it.",
    "If desired, you may also divide each cake into individual layers.",
    "A cake with many thin layers will look more elegant than a cake with thick layers.",
    "Add a 0.5 to 0.75 in (1.3 to 1.9 cm) layer of filling.",
    "This is the ideal thickness for most wedding cake fillings, but you can add more or less filling if desired.",
    "Use a frosting knife, butter knife, or spoon to spread the filling on top of the first layer.",
    "Be careful not to add too much filling or your cake layers may slide.",
    "Start with a smaller amount than you think you will need to fill a layer of the cake, then add more if needed.",
    "Put the next layer of your cake on top of the filling.",
    "Place the next layer on top of the filling.",
    "Then, you may either add another layer of filling and put another equal sized cake layer on top of it, or frost the top of this layer so you can add another tier.",
    "Separate each tier with a cake board or push supports through the layers.",
    "If you are making a multi-tiered wedding cake, you can use cake boards to separate the tiers and keep them level and supported.",
    "These are available in different sizes in craft supply stores.",
    "Use boards that are the same size as each of your layers.",
    "Alternatively, you can reinforce the cake with cake support dowels or drinking straws.",
    "Purchase cake support dowels in the baking section of a craft supply store, or cut drinking straws to the desired height.",
    "Push the dowels or straws down through each tier of the cake in 3 to 5 locations about 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) from the center of the cake.",
    "Continue filling and layering until you reach the top of the cake.",
    "You can add as many layers to your cake as needed.",
    "The layers should get smaller in circumference as you move upwards.",
    "Otherwise, it will be too much weight for the bottom of the cake to support.",
    "Decorating the Cake Make a frosting if you want to frost the cake.",
    "You can also fill the cake with the same frosting you plan to use on top of the cake, use frosting between the layers instead of frosting the top and sides of the cake, or use a different frosting for the layers than you use for decorating the cake.",
    "Make a vanilla or chocolate buttercream for a classic cake frosting\n\nMake a batch of whipped cream frosting for a fluffy cake topper.",
    "Try cream cheese frosting for a tangy finish.",

    "Frost the filled cake with the desired amount of frosting.",
    "Use a frosting knife to spread an even layer of frosting all over the top and sides of the cake.",
    "Apply a generous amount of frosting to the cake.",
    "Use even pressure when you are spreading the frosting onto the cake with the frosting knife.",
    "Continue to apply frosting and spread it around until the cake is fully covered.",
    "Frosting the entire cake will result in an elegant finish.",
    "However, if desired, you may leave the sides of the cake bare for a rustic, homemade look.",
    "If you are frosting the cake on a turntable, make sure to rotate the cake as you frost it.",
    "This will make it easier to get at the sides of the cake.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a turntable, you will need to turn the plate or move around the cake as you frost it.",
    "You will need a lot of frosting to cover a large wedding cake!",
    "Make sure you have made enough, and keep ingredients on hand to make an extra batch if needed.",
    "Use fondant if you want to decorate and cover a frosted cake.",
    "Fondant is a clay-like edible cake decoration that creates a smooth surface over a frosted cake.",
    "You can purchase pre-made fondant in the baking supply section of a craft supply store, or you can make your own fondant.",
    "Fondant is white to begin with, but you can add a few drops of gel food coloring to dye it, or purchase pre-dyed fondant in the colors of your choice.",
    "Fondant is extremely versatile.",
    "You can roll it out into a single sheet to place over a cake, cut out fondant shapes with cookie cutters to place on the cake, or stamp designs onto it using special fondant tools.",
    "Make sure to use a very clean surface when you are working with fondant because any dust or fuzz that gets onto the fondant will show up on the cake.",
    "Pipe buttercream if you want to accent the edges of the cake.",
    "You can use buttercream frosting in a piping bag with a special tip to create beautiful designs around the edges, sides, and top of your cake.",
    "Fill the frosting bag, and squeeze the frosting out gently to apply it to the cake.",
    "Move the tip as you squeeze to create ribbons of frosting, or squeeze frosting onto 1 location of the cake at a time to create individual frosting embellishments.",
    "Try making a row of pearls around the edges of your cake by piping small balls of frosting side-by-side.",
    "Use a skinny tip to create squiggly lines all over the top of your cake.",
    "Create small flowers or shells with a star-shaped tip.",
    "Make gum paste flowers to decorate your cake with edible flowers.",
    "Making gum paste flowers is an art that takes lots of time and practice, so it might not be something you want to do on your first attempt at making a wedding cake.",
    "However, if you have some experience with making gum paste flowers, you might try making some as decorations for your cake.",
    "You can make just about any type of flower you want using gum paste.",
    "Consider the season, colors, and theme of the wedding as you consider what type of flowers to make.",
    "You will need some special tools and ingredients to make gum paste flowers.",
    "Check the baking supply section of your local craft supply store for a kit that includes everything you need to make some basic flowers.",
    "Put fresh flowers on top of the cake if you want to add an elegant touch.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to make flowers and are not concerned about the decorations being edible, then you can always top your cake with real flowers.",
    "Choose flowers that will complement the colors and theme of the wedding.",
    "It is also a good idea to choose flowers that are in season such as daffodils in the spring or mums in the fall.",
    "Make sure that any flowers you place on the cake are pesticide-free.",
    "Add a cake topper if you want to finish the design.",
    "A cake topper is usually made from plastic or glass and it features a figure of the bride and groom, or another wedding symbol, such as rings or bells.",
    "A cake topper can transform a simple cake into a wedding cake, so it is worth buying one.",
    "You can go with a traditional bride and groom on top of the cake, or choose a topper that says something about the bride and groom\u2019s personalities.",
    "Look in the wedding section of your local craft supply store for cake toppers.",
    "Try checking specialty stores and Etsy shops to find a unique cake topper that will represent the bride and groom.",
