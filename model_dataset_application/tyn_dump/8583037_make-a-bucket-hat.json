  "text":" Cutting the Pieces Choose your fabric. You will need two different colors, one of the outside of the hat and one for the inside. Consider using cotton for one side and canvas or denim for the other. Cut two 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) circles. You will need to cut one circle out of each fabric. This will be the top of the hat. You will be using \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances. If you have a very small head, you might want to cut a smaller circle. If you have a bigger head, you'll need to cut a bigger circle. Cut the body pieces. You will need two 12 by 3-inch (30.48 by 7.62-centimeter) rectangles for each fabric. You should have four rectangles total. If you want a taller hat, make the rectangles 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide instead. If you cut a bigger/smaller circle, then cut each rectangle so that it measures half of the circumference. Cut the brim pieces. You will need four identical pieces total, two from each fabric. The pieces need to be 3\u00bd inches (8.89 centimeters) wide. They need to be 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long along the inner curve and 18 inches (45.72 centimeters) long around the outer curve. If you want a wider brim, cut the arches 4\u00bd inches (11.43 centimeters) wide instead. If you cut a bigger/smaller circle, match the inner curve of the brim to the length of your adjusted rectangle. Consider cutting some fusible interfacing. If your fabric is thin, you might want to add interfacing. Cut the interfacing \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) smaller than your pieces, then iron them to the wrong side of the fabric. You only need to do this for the inner or the outer fabric pieces, not both. Sewing the Hat Pin and sew the rectangles together. Pin the two outer rectangles together, right sides touching. Sew up both of the narrow ends using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces. Pin and sew the brim pieces together. Pin the two outer brim pieces together, right sides facing in. Sew along just the narrow, straight ends. Use a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces. Press the seams open on the body and brim pieces. Place one of the body pieces on the ironing board with the seam facing you. Use your iron to spread apart the seam. Press the seam open and flat. Repeat this step for all of the seams on all of the body and brim pieces. Pin and sew the body pieces to the circles. Pin the top edge of the outer body piece to the outer edge of the matching circle. Make sure that the wrong sides are facing out. Sew around the edge using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces. Pin and sew the brim to the body. Pin the inner edge of the matching brim all around the bottom edge of the body piece. Make sue that the wrong sides are facing out, then sew using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces. Assembling the Hat Tuck one hat into the other. Turn one hat right side out; leave the other one as it is. Tuck the first hat into the second one so that the right sides are pressed together and the wrong sides are facing out. Pin and sew around the outer edge of the brim. Sew using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide gap for turning. Remove the pins as you sew. Cut notches into the seams to reduce bulk. Cut a notch every \u00be inch (1.91 centimeter) to the seam around the top of the hat. Cut a notch every inch (2.54 centimeters) to the seam around the outer edge of the brim. The notches need to be just under \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) so that they don't cut into the stitching. You don't need to cut notches into the seam between the body and brim pieces. Turn the hat inside out through the gap. Shape the hat so that one piece is tucked into the other. If you need to, use a skewer or knitting needle to help push out the seams along the brim. Finishing the Hat Tuck and press the gap shut. Tuck the edges of the gap in by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) so that they match up with the rest of the brim. Press the brim flat with an iron when you are done. Topstitch around the outer edge of the brim. Sew \u00bc to \u00bd inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) away from the outer edge of the brim. Add more rows of topstitching to the brim. You don't have to do this, but it will make your hat look more professional. Simply topstitching around the brim for 4 to 5 more rows. Leave a \u00bc to \u00bd inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) gap between each row. Topstitch the top and body of the hat, if desired. Again, if you don't have to do this, but it'll give you hair a nice touch. Topstitch around the top edge of the body part, \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the seam. Next, topstitch around the bottom edge of the body part, also \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the seam.",
