  "text":" Broiling and Peeling the Peppers Adjust the oven racks and turn the broiler to high. Move the top oven rack so it's 4 inches (10 cm) below the broiler's heating element. Then turn the broiler to high. If your broiler doesn't have a high or low setting, just turn it on. Line a baking sheet with foil and put the peppers on it.

Flip the peppers slowly so hot oil doesn't splash out of the skillet. Fry the remaining peppers in batches. Transfer the fried peppers from the oil to a paper towel-lined plate and let the oil heat back up to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C).
