Make sure your entire work area is covered so you don\u2019t accidentally spill any oil or stain. Set the piece of maple you want to finish on top of the cloth before you start working. Be sure to set up in a well-ventilated area since the oil or stain could create harmful fumes."

Focus on any areas where the wood feels rough or has burrs sticking out. Keep sanding across the entire surface until it feels smooth to the touch. You can use an electric sander if you want, but you should still sand by hand afterward to make sure there aren\u2019t any marks on the wood."

  "text":" Sanding Your Wood Cover your work surface with a drop cloth or piece of cardboard. Use a painter\u2019s drop cloth or a piece of cardboard large enough to set your piece of wood on.

You don\u2019t need to apply another layer of stain if you\u2019re happy with the color of your wood. Applying a Protective Clear Coat Stir the polyurethane clear coat with a stir stick. Open the can of clear coat and use a stir stick to mix it up. Be sure not to shake the can since it could form bubbles and ruin how the clear coat applies to your piece of maple. Keep stirring the clear coat until it\u2019s thoroughly mixed. You can buy polyurethane clear coat from your local hardware store. Paint a thin layer of polyurethane onto your maple.

After 4 hours passes, touch the surface lightly to see if it feels sticky. If it does, then allow it to dry until it feels smooth. The polyurethane may take longer to dry if it\u2019s cool or humid. Sand the finish with 220-grit sandpaper. Apply light pressure with 220-grit sandpaper to smooth the surface of the polyurethane. Work along with the direction of the wood grain so you don\u2019t leave any noticeable abrasions. After you sand it, wipe off any dust with a clean cloth. Don\u2019t use lower-grit sandpaper since it will scratch and damage the finish. Apply a second coat of your finish and let it dry. Put another thin coat of the polyurethane on top of the first coat. Make sure you still follow the wood grain and work out from the center of the piece. When the second coat is applied, leave it for another 4 hours so it can harden. You can apply as many coats of polyurethane as you want to make your maple glossy.
