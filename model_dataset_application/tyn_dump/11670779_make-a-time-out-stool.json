Rotate the compass in a complete circle so a circular sketch is visible on the wood\u2019s surface. Before you continue, use the compass to draw a second, separate circle.These circles will serve as the top and bottom of your hourglass. Plywood is a great option for this part of the project.

    "During this time, don\u2019t touch or move the wooden dowels or circles.You won\u2019t be able to paint all sides of the wooden pieces.",
    "Instead, you\u2019ll have to wait for them to dry fully.",
    "Paint the opposite, unpainted sides of the wooden items.",
    "Flip or rotate the wooden pieces so you can spray paint the opposite sides of the circles and dowels.",
    "As you work, apply a thick, even coat of paint over the dowels and circles.",
    "Let these wooden pieces dry completely before moving them to your workspace.Make sure there\u2019s no rain in the forecast if you plan on spray painting your items outside.",
    "Glue the hourglass to the base wooden piece.",
    "Apply a thin stream of wood glue around the border of the small, central circle.",
    "Next, arrange 1 end of the spout over the ring of wood glue.",
    "To secure this half of the hourglass, hold it in place for several seconds.Don\u2019t glue the other half of the hourglass into place yet.",
    "The wide, cut end of the plastic bottle needs to fit snugly around the small wooden circle.",
    "Pre-drill 3 holes into the circular wooden base.",
    "Measure around the large, wooden base to find suitable placements for your wooden dowels.",
    "Lightly mark where each dowel will go, checking that all 3 points are equidistant from one another.",
    "Next, drill into these marked areas, so you can keep track of where the dowels are supposed to go.You\u2019ll be using both screws and glue to secure the dowels in place on the stool.",
    "Use wood glue to attach the dowels to the base.",
    "Squeeze out a bead of glue on the bottom of your dowel.",
    "Next, arrange the dowel over 1 of the drill holes, then press it into place for several seconds.",
    "Repeat this glueing and pressing process with the other 2 dowels.About half of your stool should be constructed at this point.",
    "Funnel in \u00bd cup (150 g) of salt into the spout.",
    "Pour at least \u00bd cup (150 g) of white salt or sand (191 g) through a funnel into the bottom section of your hourglass.",
    "Note that every \u00bd cup of sand or salt is equal to 1 minute of time in the physical hourglass.If you don\u2019t have sand or salt on hand, you can purchase it at a craft or grocery store, respectively.",
    "Salt can provide a lighter contrast to the bright paint color of your stool.",
    "When interacting with young children, try to keep the minutes of timeout equal to their age.",
    "For instance, if you\u2019re dealing with in a 2-year-old, consider adding 1 cup (300 g) of salt into the stool, which will take 2 minutes to funnel through the hourglass.",
    "Secure the top wooden base to the dowels and hourglass with wood glue.",
    "Squeeze another dot of glue onto the center of each dowel.",
    "Additionally, add a thin ring of glue around the small wooden circle attached to the base.",
    "After applying the glue, position the base over the dowels and open hourglass spout, then press it into place for several seconds.The glue provides an extra layer of stability to your stool.",
    "This only applies to the top portion of the stool.",
    "Screw 6 screws into the base of each dowel after the glue dries.",
    "Read the instructions on the wood glue to see how long the product takes to air-dry.",
    "Once the adhesive has hardened, drill 1 screw into the base of each dowel.",
    "After the screws are in place, you can use your timeout stool whenever you\u2019d like!"
