You can even use a ribbon tied around the stick to hold the cellophane in place and give a fancier appearance. The cellophane should completely cover the apple, but it is okay if some of the stick is left uncovered."

If you don\u2019t have a container large enough, organize the apples on a flat surface with the sticks upright. Cover them with a sheet or light blanket to keep them protected."

Avoid storing the apples in areas near windows, radiators, heating vents, and air returns, as they can cause the candy coating to melt. You can store the apples outside of the refrigerator for up to an hour. If they won\u2019t be eaten within an hour, it\u2019s best to keep them in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to eat. If you notice a brown coloring on the inside of the apple when you cut it open, immediately throw the apple away and don\u2019t eat it. A brown apple is the only way to tell that the candy apple has gone bad."

The wax paper only needs to cover the apple portion of the treat, and should stick to the coating. If you would like to, you can use a rubber band or ribbon to tie the wax paper to the stick.

If you don\u2019t have a lid, a towel or sheet draped over the top of the container will keep your apples safe from heat and light.
