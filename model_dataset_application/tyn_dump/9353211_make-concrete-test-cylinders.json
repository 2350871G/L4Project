Place all of them with the opening up on a flat, even surface. Keep all of your equipment easily accessible so that you can readily use it. Making the Concrete Cylinders Scoop concrete into each cylinder mold. Using the concrete scoop (or a small shovel if a scoop is not available), scoop concrete into the cylinder mold.
