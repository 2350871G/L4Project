Ensure you\u2019re using wire which is uncoated, nonmagnetic, and somewhat pliable. Coated copper wire is generally made of multiple thin copper filaments woven into a rope-like wire. This type of wire is too weak to maintain a bendable shape, a quality which you\u2019ll want it to have later. The magnet should be a flattened cylinder with a diameter no larger than about one centimeter. Be careful not to let small children play with the magnet. Also, do not place it on or near electronics equipment, including tablets, phones, or MP3 players."

If you want to adjust the position of the screw on the magnet, you should be able to slide it around. If you want to use another screw for some reason (or suddenly realize you need to hang up a picture with the screw), try pushing it off the magnet rather than trying to pull it straight out."
