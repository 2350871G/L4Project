Take a tape measure and measure the length of the space where the cut cinder block will fit. Don't worry about measuring the width of the space since cinder blocks are commonly a uniform size.

For example, if the space that the cinder block needs to fit into is 8 inches (20 cm) long, measure 8 inches (20 cm) in from the end of a cinderblock and make a chalk mark. If you\u2019d like to be as accurate as possible, hold the straight edge of a ruler across the block at the 8 in (20 cm) mark.

Remove the retaining bolt at the center of the circular blade with a \u20444 in (1.9 cm) wrench. Once the bolt is off, lift the blade out of its housing and set the masonry blade in its place. Set the bolt back in place over the center of the blade and screw it back into position with the wrench. Then, release the blade cover so it snaps back into place over the blade. If you don\u2019t have a masonry blade (or a circular saw), purchase one at a local hardware store.

Always wear a surgical mask to protect your lungs when splitting or cutting cinder blocks. The dust that this kicks up can damage your lungs if you inhale it. To protect your hearing from the loud saw, also wear a pair of sound-blocking earmuffs or ear plugs. It\u2019s also smart to protect your eyes from the small chunks of cinder block that the saw kicks up by wearing a pair of protective plastic glasses."

As you cut, the protective covering will be pushed back, allowing more of the blade to contact the cinder block. In most cases, you can cut through the block in 1 go. If the cinder block isn\u2019t quite cut, though, make another 2 or 3 cuts to finish bisecting it. Unplug the saw once you\u2019re finished cutting through the block. If you\u2019re using 1 hand to stabilize the block while your cut, keep your fingers out of the way of the saw! A circular saw could easily cut a finger off."
