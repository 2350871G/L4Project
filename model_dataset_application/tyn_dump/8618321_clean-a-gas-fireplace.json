If you leave the gas running, it could cause a dangerous gas leak in your house. The gas valve is typically on the wall next to the fireplace. Allow a few minutes for all the gas to leave the piping in the fireplace. You also need to wait until all of the gas fireplace components are cool before you begin the cleaning process."

Be gentle with your brushing because you don't want to damage the fragile logs. Be sure to check each log for signs of corrosion \u2014 things like cracking, splitting, or burn holes \u2014 before returning them to the fireplace for use again. When you replace the logs, put them back exactly as they were. Don't rearrange them. The logs are designed and situated in a certain way to produce the best results."

This should suck up any loose dirt or grime that has settled on the rocks. If some of your lava rocks are too small to be vacuumed without getting sucked up in the machine, put a piece of cheesecloth over the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner and secure it with a rubber band. You can also use the vacuum hose to clean up around the vent of the heat exchanger. Use a soft-bristled brush to clean up any soot build-up."

An inspector will look at all the pieces \u2013 including the logs and the lava rocks \u2013 to make sure all of the pieces are in proper working order. They'll also be able to tell you if there are any leaks in the piping and whether or not the pressurization levels are accurate.
