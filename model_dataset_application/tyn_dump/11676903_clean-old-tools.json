    "Mix the ingredients together with a paint stirrer or other utensil to make sure that they\u2019re completely combined.",
    "Let your tools soak in the mixture for 20 minutes.",
    "Arrange the metal, rusty portions of your tools in the acidic solution, then set a timer for 20 minutes.",
    "If your tools are made entirely of metal, you can place the entire item in the bucket.",
    "If the items have wooden handles, only place the metal surface into the bucket.While oxalic acid isn\u2019t as potent as other acids, it\u2019s still a pretty strong substance.",
    "To prevent your wooden handles from getting degraded, try to keep them out of the solution altogether.",
    "Remove any stubborn portions of rust with a wire brush.",
    "With your protective gloves on, remove the tools from the bucket.",
    "If the rust hasn\u2019t soaked off completely, use coarse-grit sandpaper or a wire-bristled brush to scrub the surface of the tool.",
    "Apply an even amount of pressure, working in short, even strokes to remove the leftover rust.Continue wearing your protective eye gear during this part of the process.",
    "Rinse the tools off with clean, cool water.",
    "While wearing gloves, remove your older tools from the mixture and set them aside.",
    "Next, run the metal portion of each tool under cool running water to get rid of any lingering acid.",
    "Once the tools are rinsed, you can set them aside on a flat, clean surface.If you don\u2019t rinse off the extra acid, it could do long-term damage to your tools.",
    "Soak the clean tools in a mixture of baking soda and water for 10 minutes.",
    "Pour at least 4 tablespoon (59.1 ml) (58 g) of baking soda into a bucket or basin filled with 5 litres (21  c) of water, then stir the ingredients together.",
    "Add your clean, rinsed tools into the mixture  and let them sit for several minutes."
