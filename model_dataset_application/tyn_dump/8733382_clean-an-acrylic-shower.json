To prevent doing lasting damage to your shower, pick out a product that doesn\u2019t contain any harsh chemicals or astringents. Your best bet is to use a mild acid-based solution like Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, Formula 409 All-Purpose cleaner or Bar Keeper\u2019s Friend. Stay away from any type of astringent cleanser, including Comet, Ajax and Scrubbing Bubbles, as well as solvents like acetone.

You may need to use quite a bit of cleaner in order to penetrate multiple layers of dried-on residue. Be sure to remove all soaps, shampoos and other hygiene products from the shower before you get started so that you can clean underneath them.

Once you\u2019ve given the shower a preliminary rinse, go over the acrylic using a soft microfiber towel or sponge to remove any remaining residue. For stubborn residue, use an old toothbrush to scrub it away. If you don't have a detachable shower head, the easiest way to rinse your shower walls is to use a cup or bucket to splash warm water onto the areas that need rinsing. Never use abrasive scrubbers, such as wire brushes or rough kitchen sponges, to clean an acrylic surface. These will leave behind tiny scratches in the finish that will then trap dirt in the future, making it much harder to remove."

The heat from the water will be even more helpful for releasing dried stains from the surface of the shower. For even better results, add a few drops of mild liquid dishwashing detergent.

For most light or moderate messes, the vinegar should sit for at least half an hour. To remove heavier buildup, you may even want to let it remain for 1-2 hours to ensure success. If vinegar alone isn\u2019t cutting it, sprinkle a little baking soda over the affected area before spraying it again. The foaming action produced by the two cleaners will eat away at stubborn gunk and grime. A mixture of hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar can make a convenient substitute for baking soda and vinegar."

You can now grip it by the peel-side and use it as a handheld scrubber to treat yucky shower stains. Pick out the seeds before you start scrubbing so they don\u2019t end up at the bottom of your shower. The natural acids in lemon juice are safe enough for you to use them to clean your shower as often as you\u2019d like without having to worry about wearing down the acrylic finish. You may also have success using another type of citrus, such as grapefruit."

After you\u2019ve worn the lemon down, simply grab the other half or cut a new one and keep going over the area until it\u2019s spotless. Just as a precaution, avoid using lemon in conjunction with other green cleaning ingredients like sea salt. Even water-soluble abrasives may be enough to scratch up acrylic."

Though mild, the acids that the juice contains will usually be enough to deal with the majority of commonplace stains. The longer you let the juice soak, the better the end result will be. Lemon juice is especially useful for dissolving stains that result from exposure to hard water or chemicals. Citric acid will not only clean and disinfect, it will also help brighten up the acrylic and restore it to its original luster."
