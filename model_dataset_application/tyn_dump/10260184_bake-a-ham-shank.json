Store leftovers in the fridge for up to a week as a tasty filling for sandwiches, or as a protein in a salad. Baking a Fully Cooked Ham Shank with a Sugar Glaze Preheat your oven to 165 \u00b0C (329 \u00b0F). If you preheat the oven before preparing the shank, the oven should be at the correct temperature once it is time to bake it. Confirm that the ham shank is fully cooked. Some ham shanks will come from the butchers fully cooked. This means that the bones will have been discarded already. Check the outer labeling on the ham shank to confirm whether it is fully cooked. Remove the wrapping and place the ham shank in a roasting pan. Carefully remove the plastic wrapping from the ham shank. Be careful that none of the plastic sticks to the meat. Then, once the ham shank is unwrapped, place it into a roasting pan. Place the large end face down, then glaze with mustard. Turn the ham shank in the roasting pan so that the larger side is face down in the pan. Then, apply a healthy coating of mustard on the ham shank. Smother the ham in mustard until the outer side of the ham shank has a thin, constant coating. Different mustards will have different tastes, so feel free to experiment. If you need to, flip the ham shank around so that you can cover all the sides including the meat side that is face down. The mustard is used to glaze the meat. There will be a very slight taste of mustard at the end. The mustard won't overpower the flavors at the end of the recipe. This glaze should be fine for those who don't like mustard. Around 5 tablespoons (0.4c) of mustard should be more than enough to cover a typical 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) to 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) ham shank. Rub in 300 grams (0.66 lb) of brown sugar. Rub 300 grams (0.66 lb) of brown sugar onto the side of the meat. It will dissolve in the mustard. Keep rubbing it in until all the sides of the ham shank appear browned. All the sugar should have dissolved. Once it's completely covered, place the shank back in the roasting pan with the large side face down. Wrap the roasting pan in aluminum foil. Wrap the entirety of the roasting pan with good quality aluminum foil so that the ham shank is completely covered. Aluminum foil will provide a healthy internal sizzle. You can also put on a tight-fitting roasting pan lid, but the glaze may take longer to crystallize. Bake the ham shank for 20 minutes per 450 grams (0.99 lb) of meat. The time it takes to bake a fully cooked ham shank varies depending on how heavy it is. Place the entire ham shank in the oven at 165 \u00b0C (329 \u00b0F) for 20 minutes per 450 grams (0.99 lb) of meat. Measure internal heat with a meat thermometer. Bring the ham shank out of the oven and measure the internal heat with a heat thermometer. The heat at the thickest part of the meat should measure around 75 \u00b0C (167 \u00b0F).

Once the shank hits the desired heat, use a spoon to baste the ham in its own juices. Then, cook it for another 10 minutes so the shank will completely brown. Let the meat rest for 15 minutes before serving the shank. Put the covered roasting pan out onto a heat-safe surface to let the meat rest for 15 minutes.
