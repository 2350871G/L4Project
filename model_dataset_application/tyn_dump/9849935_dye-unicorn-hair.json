If you want something that looks good on you, consider altering the shades to better suit your skin tone. For example:\nCool, fair skin: choose warm shades, such as pale pink, peach, or tangerine. Warm, fair skin: choose cool shades, such as lavender, robin's egg blue, or aqua. Cool, medium skin: stick with a deep, jewel tone, such as amethyst or ruby. Warm, medium skin: stick with a saturated shade, such as aquamarine, emerald, or sapphire. Cool, dark skin: try a pastel shade, such as lilac. Warm, dark skin: try a darker shade, such as plum."

There are some vegan hair dyes that do not require any bleaching. Look for labels such as \"For Dark Hair\" or \"Does Not Require Bleaching.\" If your dye comes in a tube, you'll likely need a 10 or 20 volume developer.

You should do this step if you used hair chalk or eye shadow too. Wash your hair with shampoo when you no longer want unicorn hair. Most temporary dyes should come right out, but some may require 2 to 3 washes. Alternatively, you can wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo. Since most cleansing shampoos contain drying sulfates, it would be a good idea to follow up with conditioner. Maintaining Your Hair Use color-safe shampoo and conditioner. If possible, use shampoo and conditioner specially formulated for dyed hair. If you cannot find any, stick with sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. The label should say whether or not it is sulfate-free, but double-check the ingredient label. Wash your hair with cool water. The water does not have to be freezing, but it should be the coldest temperature that you can stand. Anything between cool and lukewarm is safe. Don't use hot water, or the dye will fade. It will also make your hair dry and frizzy. Limit your exposure to sunlight, sea water, and chlorine. All of these can cause your hair color to fade. Cover your hair with a hat whenever you step outside, and use a swim cap whenever you go swimming in the pool or ocean. If you don't like to wear hats, try hoods or scarves. You can also spray your hair with a UV protection spray. Reduce washing your hair to 2 to 3 times per week maximum. It would be even better if you reduced it to once or twice a week. If your hair has a tendency to get oily, consider using a dry shampoo between washes.",
