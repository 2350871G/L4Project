How many you blow up depends on how many lights are on your garland. You will need 1 balloon for each light on the garland. You don't have to blow regular balloons up to their full size. Keep in mind that they will end up more oval or egg-shaped. You should still blow water balloons up with air; don't use water. Match the size of the balloon to the bulb. Small balloons will work better for tiny fairy lights than standard-sized balloons. If you are using icicle lights, you will need 1 balloon for each icicle."

For icicle lights, insert each icicle into each ball, then tie the balls to the main wire with clear thread. This works best for large balls made from standard-sized balloons.
