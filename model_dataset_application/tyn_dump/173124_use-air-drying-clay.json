Resin based clay is denser and will pull apart like fudge, caramel, or toffee."

Opened clay is hard to store and can easily become hard to work with and useless. . You can purchase your clay locally at an arts and crafts store, or purchase it online. If you still aren't sure what type of clay to use, or want advice on your project, some stores have clerks that can answer your questions, and even offer classes.

Conditioning the clay is essential for proper use. If you planned to work with multiple bags of clay, knead them one at a time. If using multiple bags for one piece, knead the clay together after each bag of clay has been warmed and kneaded separately. If using paper based clay, you can add a small amount of water to additionally soften the clay. Resin based clay can be softened (and colored!) with acrylic paint."
