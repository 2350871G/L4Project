Any paint or rust you leave behind will damage your new coat of paint. Be thorough and reach every spot with the brush. If there are still tough rust spots that won\u2019t come off, try using a powered grinder to remove them. This uses a spinning stone to grind away rust.

You can choose between a roll-on and spray primer. A roll-on primer is applied with a brush or roller like paint. This is more time-consuming, but it\u2019s easier to control and avoids making a mess. Spray primer works the same way as spray paint and is faster to work with. Make sure you cover everything in the area with a sheet to avoid getting primer on it and don\u2019t work if it\u2019s windy.

Roll-on primer takes closer to 4 hours. Both take longer if the weather is humid. Tap the fence gently with your finger to monitor how dry the primer is. If it still feels sticky, it\u2019s not dry enough. Start painting once the primer is dry for the best coat of paint."
