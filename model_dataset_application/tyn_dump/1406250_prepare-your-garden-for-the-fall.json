Some crops will be ready to prune as soon as fall strikes, while others can wait until the first frost or the next spring. Check your plants\u2019 pruning instructions online. For example, you can prune plants like perennial herbs, blackberries, raspberries, roses, and fruit trees.

Put your soil in the testing chamber, and stop when you reach the indicated line. Then, add distilled water with an eye-dropper. Wait 1-2 minutes for the soil test to complete, and do this to test both nutrients and pH levels. To determine the levels, check the color of the indicator and match it with the key on your test kit. To make your soil more acidic, add sulfur, aluminum sulfate, or iron sulfate. To make your soil more basic, use powdered limestone or lime.

A rich layer of compost will replenish the soil\u2019s nutrients, whether you are growing crops in the fall or waiting until springtime. If after testing your soil you realize there is a depletion of particular nutrients, you can add fertilizer in that nutrient instead of compost.

You can purchase mulch at a garden store or local nursery. Dried grass clippings, straw, wood chips, and pine needles also work. Adding the right amount of mulch is important to avoid pests and diseases. Once the ground freezes, pests and diseases often die off. If you have too much mulch, the cold temperatures will not spread into your soil. Mulch helps protect your soil and prevent weeds from emerging. As the mulch breaks down, it will release new nutrients into the soil."
