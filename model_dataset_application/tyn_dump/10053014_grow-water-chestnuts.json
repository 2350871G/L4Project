Water chestnuts propagate quickly, so you only need to get 2 seedlings or corms per 1 square foot (0.093 m) in your container. Corms are rounded bulbs that will grow a new plant. Seedlings, on the other hand, will already have green growth on the top. Corms and seedlings are planted and grown in a similar way, so choose depending on availability or cost. You can also find the bulbs at Asian markets. Look for them in the produce section."
