Purchase salmon, deer, beef, or caribou that don't contain preservatives or added flavorings or dry your own. To dry your own, start with \u20444 pound (340 g) of fresh meat or fish since it will lose weight as it dries. Briefly cook it in a 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) oven and turn it off. Leave it to dry in the oven for about 1 day. For a hands-off way to dry meat or fish, put the prepared meat in a dehydrator and dry it for 8 to 12 hours. For pemmican that has the most nutritional value, choose grass-fed meat instead of grain-fed meat. Grass-fed cows ingest more nutrients that are passed on in the meat, such as omega-3s, vitamins B1 and B2, and vitamin E."

          "description":"Most pemmican recipes rely on using equal amounts of dried fish or meat and dried berries. Dry your own or buy dried berries, such as Canadian Saskatoon berries, blueberries, or cranberries. To dry your own, start with about 3/4 cup (225 g) of fresh berries. Spread them on a baking sheet and cook them at 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) for up to 10 hours or put them in a dehydrator for 10 to 16 hours. The berries will add a tangy flavor to the pemmican. If you don't want the flavor, you can leave the berries out and double the amount of dried meat or fish."

Since the berries have lots of very tiny seeds, you'll need to spend about 20 minutes to grind the berries into a fine powder.

Start with at least 1 cup (200 g) of fat and shred it until it's crumbly. Heat it over low for 2 to 3 hours so impurities float to the top and strain it to use in the pemmican. To save time, you can purchase rendered fat and then measure out as much as you need. Look for fats from beef, elk, bison, or caribou.Tip: Avoid using vegetable oil, shortening, or butter in the pemmican. These can separate and they don't contain the nutrients that fat from red meat has. Although you can use pork or lamb fat, they don't contain the same nutritious fatty acids as grass-fed red meats have. If you want to render bacon grease, it's important to heat it slowly over low heat until all of the water evaporates from the grease."
