The most important thing is that the unsalted butter slices are all approximately the same size, so they will melt evenly. Don't worry about the temperature of the butter when you're cutting it.

The weight of the pan is important, because light saucepans may heat unevenly and create hot spots, which will cause your butter to melt and cook unevenly. Heavy non-stick saucepans are fine. It's also better to use a light-colored saucepan, such as stainless steel. This will allow you to see the color of its contents more accurately, which is essential when making brown butter. Avoid using cast iron saucepans for this reason."
