Remove the trim (if there is any) by pulling on it; it should come off easily. Using scissors, puncture the old fabric and gently cut sections away from the frame. Make sure you don't cut the liner fabric. You should also remove the old fabric if it's a darker color than the fabric you're using to recover the lampshade. If the original fabric is thick, keep in mind that light might have a hard time getting through 2 layers of fabric. If you're covering a plastic lampshade liner, you don't need to remove anything."

  "text":" Removing Old Fabric Clear off a big enough work space to fit your materials. You will want to work at a table, as you will need a flat surface where you can spread out all of your materials. You should consider putting newspaper down on the table and on the ground surrounding your work station because spray adhesive can stick to almost any surface and could do damage to your furniture or floor. Remove any old fabric from the lampshade frame. If the old fabric of your shade is torn or ruined in any way, you'll want to remove it before you recover the shade. Remove the trim (if there is any) by pulling on it; it should come off easily. Using scissors, puncture the old fabric and gently cut sections away from the frame.

If the original fabric is thick, keep in mind that light might have a hard time getting through 2 layers of fabric. If you're covering a plastic lampshade liner, you don't need to remove anything.

You can use a pair of small scissors or a sewing blade to cut through ribbon without puncturing the shade. Then, pull it away. Choose a thin, lightweight fabric. When recovering a lamp, you will want to choose a fabric that is lightweight and relatively thin. If the fabric is too heavy, the light from the lamp won't be able to shine through. When you're choosing your fabric, stick to thin fabric like cotton. You can also test the fabric by holding it up to a light and making sure enough comes through. Another thing to keep in mind is the pattern of your fabric. Drum and rectangular lampshades will look great in any fabric. Tapered lampshades look best in more randomized patterns. Creating a Template Use tracing paper and a pencil to trace the shape and size of your shade. Lay your shade on its side on the tracing paper. Make a mark on your shade so you know where you began. Then roll your lamp shade along the paper, tracing the path it makes with a pencil. Make sure you're marking along the top and bottom of the shade.

Adding an extra 1 in (2.5 cm) to each edge of your tracing will give you enough extra fabric. Cut out your pattern. Once you've added the extra length to your pattern, use scissors to cut it out. You will use this pattern to trace the shape and size of your shade onto your chosen fabric. Cutting the Fabric Spread the fabric face down on your work surface. Make sure there is no bunching or wrinkling and that the material is completely smooth on the flat surface. You want it to be smooth so that you do not accidentally cut across a wrinkle and end up with an uneven fabric cover for your lamp. If the fabric is wrinkled, iron it before you lay it out. If the fabric is old or you've repurposed it from another project, consider washing it first. Trace your template onto your fabric. Lay your template down on top of your fabric.

Use fabric scissors to cut the template out of your fabric. Fabric scissors will cut through the fabric better than regular scissors will, preventing frayed edges. Gently cut the material along the lines you traced from the template. Remove any remaining fabric from the work surface. Recovering the Shade Spray the underside of the fabric with adhesive. Lay the fabric out flat, face down. Apply a spray adhesive to the fabric, holding the can about 3 in (7.6 cm) away from the fabric. It is very important that you do this in a well-ventilated area, as spray adhesive can make you very ill if you breath in too much of it. Avoid spraying the adhesive on anything besides the fabric. Remember that spray adhesive is incredibly sticky (and permanent). If you accidentally spray it on anything else, you could have a mess on your hands! Cover the floor around your work area with newspaper and cover any furniture with a sheet or blanket. Position your lamp about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edges of the fabric. Carefully set your shade down on the fabric, about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edge, top, and bottom. If you're recovering a tapered shade, make sure you match the top of the shade to top of the fabric and the bottom of the shade to the bottom of the fabric.
