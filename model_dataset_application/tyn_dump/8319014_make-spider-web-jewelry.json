    "Find a small jump ring.",
    "Grab one end of it with a pair of needle nose pliers.",
    "Grab the other end with your fingers or a second pair of needle nose pliers.",
    "Carefully twist the two ends of the jump ring past each other, like opening a door.",
    "Do not pull them away from each other.",
    "Slip the web and an earring hook onto the jump ring.",
    "Find one of the outermost strands on your web, and slip it onto the jump ring.",
    "Next, slip an earring hook onto the jump ring.",
    "Be sure to use a color that matches the jump ring.",
    "If you used a silver jump ring, use a silver earring hook.",
    "Close the jump ring.",
    "Use the same technique as you did when opening it.",
    "Grab one end with a pair of needle nose pliers, and the other end with your fingers or a second pair of pliers.",
    "Twist the two ends towards each other, like shutting a door.",
    "If there is a small gap in the jump ring, pinch it shut with your finger tips.",
    "Repeat the process to make a earring web.",
    "If the parchment paper is too dirty to work on, pull it off and tape a fresh sheet down on top.",
    "You can make the second earring exactly like the first one, or vary the design a little.",
    "Add some details, if desired.",
    "At this point, your earrings are done.",
    "You can, however, hot glue a little spider charm to each web.",
    "This will give the webs that final, spooky touch.",
    "Make your own spider.",
    "Hot glue an oval rhinestone, then use glitter glue to draw some legs and a head.",
    "Hot glue tends to leave behind little strands.",
    "You can pull these off, or leave them on for a more web-like feel.",
    "Making Wire Earrings or Pendants Measure and cut your wire with a pair of flush wire cutters.",
    "Measure and cut three 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) long pieces of 22-gauge wire.",
    "Measure and cut a 50-inch (127-centimeter) long piece of 26-gauge wire.",
    "You can use any color of wire you want, but black or silver would look best for this project.",
    "Wrap the end of the long wire around middle of the three short wires.",
    "Hold the three short wires together and find the middle.",
    "Place the long wire behind them, a with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long tail sticking out from beneath.",
    "Wrap the long wire four times around the bundle.",
    "Trim off the tail-end of the long wire with a pair of flush wire cutters.",
    "If the stub that's left on the bundle is sharp, carefully press it down using a pair of needle nose pliers.",
    "Do not cut off the rest of the long wire.",
    "Spread the spokes out evenly.",
    "Take the three 22-gauge wires, and spread them out evenly to form a star or \"*\" shape.",
    "They may slip and slide through the wrapped wire, so make sure that they are all the same length.",
    "Weave the long wire around the spokes for two rounds.",
    "Once the spokes are the way you want them, weave the long wire over and under them, like making a basket.",
    "Keep doing this until you are back where you started, then repeat for a second round.",
    "Push the long wire down into the crevices every so often.",
    "Keep the long wire pulled nice and taut.",
    "Start wrapping the long wire around each spoke.",
    "Bring the long wire under the next spoke and pull it taut.",
    "Bring it up, over, and around the spoke.",
    "Give it a gentle tug, and push the wrapped part down.",
    "Move onto the next spoke.",
    "Continue wrapping the long wire around each spoke until you run out.",
    "Keep the spokes nice and straight, and the long wire pulled taut.",
    "Remember to push the wrapped \"knots\" down to the previous one.",
    "If the web starts to warp, pinch it between your thumb and fore finger.",
    "Wrap the tail-end of the long wire around the spoke.",
    "When the wire is too short to reach the next spoke, you are done weaving.",
    "Use a pair of needle nose pliers to wrap it tightly around the current spoke three times.",
    "Trim off the tail-end.",
    "Use you pair of flush wire cutters for this.",
    "You will have long spokes sticking out all around the web.",
    "Don't cut these off just yet.",
    "Loop the end of the last spoke.",
    "Squeeze a pair of wire looping pliers over the last spoke you wrapped, close to the \"knot.\"",
    "Pull the tail-end of the spoke down behind the looping wires, towards the center of the web.",
    "If you can't find any wire looping pliers, you will need to trim the spokes down, and wrap them using a pair of round nose plies.",
    "Wrap and trim tail-end of the loop.",
    "Bring the tail-end of the loop towards you, then wrap it around the \"neck\" of the loop.",
    "Trim the tail-end off.",
    "If you need to, use your needle nose pliers to tuck in any sharp ends.",
    "Remove the wire looping pliers when you are done.",
    "This wrapped loop will be the top of your earring or pendant.",
    "Add an earring hook to the loop.",
    "Use a pair of needle nose pliers to open up an earring hook.",
    "Slide the two ends past each other, not away.",
    "Slip the loop onto the hook, then close the hook by pushing the ends back towards each other.",
    "If you wish to make a pendant, use a large jump ring instead.",
    "Slip the jump ring onto a plain necklace.",
    "Loop the other spokes.",
    "You do not have to wrap the tail-end around the neck of each loop this time.",
    "Simply, make the loop, close it, and trim off the tail.",
    "Consider adding a spider charm.",
    "Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop on the bottom of your earring.",
    "Slip a spider charm onto it, then twist the loop back shut.",
    "Some charms have big, clunky jump rings.",
    "If your charm has one, you might want to remove it first.",
    "This will make your earrings look nicer.",
    "Use these steps to make a second earring.",
    "You can have the second earring match the first one, or you can make it a little different.",
    "For example, you can use a different spider charm, or you can skip it altogether."
