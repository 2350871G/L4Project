To operate the pressure washer, plug it in and hold the nozzle attached to the spraying wand. Start by cleaning the wood with water, then spray desk stripper on the wood to remove any old paint. Once the paint is gone, empty out the pressure washer, fill it with water, and rinse the deck. Then, spray brightener on the wood if you'd like to lighten it. Unlike stripper, brightener doesn\u2019t have to be rinsed off after being sprayed on. Make sure that the washer tip is at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from the wood once you start spraying. When using deck stripper, consider switching the angle of the sprayer to 25 or 30 degrees. In the case of wood brightener, adjust the spray so it spritzed at a 40-45 degree angle. For both products, make sure that the washer is set to 1,000 psi."
