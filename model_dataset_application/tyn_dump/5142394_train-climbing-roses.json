Hold each cane against the support naturally and make loose ties with 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) of \u201cgive\u201d so that the plant has enough airflow to grow properly."

Once you think the canes have grown about this far from the initial ties, measure the growth with measuring tape to be sure. Then, tie each cane as you did before, loosely to the support without forcing them in any specific direction.

Use 8\u201312 in (20\u201330 cm) strips of pantyhose to loosely tie these healthiest canes to the support, but this time tie them so that they\u2019re positioned as horizontally as possible across the support. As they grow, continue tying the canes horizontally at evenly spaced intervals. Positioning climbing roses horizontally encourages the growth of side shoots, or laterals, that extend from the main canes. This allows the plant to produce more flowers."

Each spring, after the first main flush of blooms, remove the ties on the old, gray, woody-looking canes and cut them off at the base with pruning shears. This is healthy for your plant because it helps to improve airflow and direct future growth. In addition to removing dead, damaged, and diseased canes, you may also need to remove canes that cross and suckers that grow from below the graft union. Don\u2019t prune your plant at all during its first 3 years of life."
