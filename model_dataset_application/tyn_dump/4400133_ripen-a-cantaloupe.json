Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe. Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet. Even if the melon is not quite ripe, however, noting the color will give you an idea of whether or not the fruit is close to being ripe. You must allow the cantaloupe to mature completely on the vine. Unlike other fruits, melons do not develop any sugars once they are harvested, so the cantaloupe will not become any sweeter after you remove it from the vine. The color and texture may change afterward, but the taste will not."

If you aren't sure whether or not the crack is deep or complete enough, test it by applying pressure to the side of the stem. Place your thumb directly next to the stem and apply pressure to the side of the stem. You should only need to use a little force, and the stem should begin to separate easily."

          "description":"Use a brown paper bag that is large enough to fit the cantaloupe with a little extra room. The fruit should not be squeezed into the bag too tightly. Ideally, you should leave a little room for airflow inside the bag. Make sure that you close the top of the bag when you are ready to let the melon begin ripening. The closed paper bag traps the ethylene gas produced by the cantaloupe as it ripens. The production of ethylene gas increases in the presence of additional ethylene gas, so keeping the gas concentrated within the space of the bag speeds up the ripening process. You need to use a paper bag instead of a plastic one. Paper bags are porous, so carbon dioxide can escape and oxygen can enter. Without at least this much airflow, the cantaloupe can begin to ferment."

If it is, you should give up on that cantaloupe now, since it suggests that the melon was harvested before it was able to fully mature on the vine. A cantaloupe like that will never ripen. Also check the rind around the stem end of the cantaloupe. If there are any tears in the rind, those could also suggest that the fruit was picked too early. Make sure that the stem end is slightly indented since this indicates that it was easily plucked off the vine. If the stem end protrudes, that could be another sign of a premature harvest. You should also avoid cantaloupe when the stem end has notably soft, moist spots around it. That could suggest that the fruit is actually over-ripe."

If it feels hard, you should allow the melon to ripen at room temperature for another day or so. On the other hand, if the cantaloupe yields too much or feels mushy, the fruit is likely over-ripe. Similarly, you should pick up the melon as you check it over, as well. When ripe, the cantaloupe will feel heavy for its size."

If you cannot smell anything yet, try ripening the cantaloupe for another half a day or so. If you are unfamiliar with the smell of a cantaloupe, simply sniff for a notably sweet scent. The blossom end is where the softening begins and the aroma first develops, so the scent will be strongest and easily noticed there."
