Measure across the newly-shortened hem, then sew the sleeve together as directed by the pattern. If you are modifying a sleeve that's already sewn, cut the cuff off at the seam, then measure the circumference along the newly-cut edge. Figure out your measurements for the cuff pattern. The pattern simply is a rectangle that is 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) tall and 90% of your sleeve's width. You may have to round the answer up to an easier measurement. For example, if your sleeve was 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) wide:\n0.90 x 8 = 7.2\nRound 7.2 to 7.25, which translates to 7\u00bc inches (18.41 centimeters). Choose and cut your fabric. Draw your pattern on a piece of paper first, then cut it out. Pin the pattern to a piece of fabric, and cut out two identical pieces. You can use special ribbing fabric meant for making sweatshirt cuffs or t-shirt material (jersey). Try to use the same color as your sweatshirt. Make sure that the length of the rectangle runs across the grain. Sometimes, cuff ribbing comes pre-folded. You will have to unfold it first, then cut it to the right size. Fold the first rectangle in half lengthwise with the right sides facing in. Set the rectangle down on a smooth surface. Fold the top, long edge down towards the bottom long edge. Make sure that the right sides are facing in. Set the other rectangle aide for now. You'll do just one cuff first. Mark a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) segment along the middle of the bottom edge. Find the center of the bottom cut edge, then mark it with a sewing pin. Use a fabric pen or chalk to make a mark 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the left and right of the pin. Remove the pin when you are done. You will have a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) segment in the middle of your bottom cut edge. Make sure that you are making your marks along the bottom, long, cut edge--not the folded edge or the sides. Sew across the bottom edge, right between the to marks. Use a matching thread color, a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance, and a stretch stitch or zigzag stitch. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Do not sew across the entire bottom edge. Making the Thumb Hole Fold the cuff in half widthwise. The top, narrow edge will be folded, and the bottom narrow edge will be loose. One of the long side edges will also be folded. The other long side edge will have the 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) zigzag stitch on the top. The fabric below that sewn segment will be loose. Pin the two outer edges together. Your cuff will have four layer: two outer and two inner. Tuck the two inner layers out of the way first. Pin the two outer layers together along the edge. Sew along the edge for about 1\u00bd inches (3.81 centimeters). Begin sewing just below the zigzag stitch, and finish sewing 1\u00bd inches (3.81 centimeters) below it. Use a matching thread color, a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance, and a stretch/zigzag stitch. Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Do not cross over the initial zigzag stitch from the previous sewing. If anything, you want a very small gap between the two stitches. Remove the pins when you are done. Turn the tube inside out. You should have something that is like a tube right now. Fold the raw, bottom edge of the tube inward, so that what was on the outside is now on the inside. You should have something that looks similar to what you started with, except that the inside layers are now sewn together. Repeat the process for the other two edges. Pin the new outer layers of fabric together. Sew along the edge for another 1\u00bd inches (3.81 centimeters). Use a matching thread color, a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance, and a zigzag or stretch stitch. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Snip off any loose or hanging threads. Take a moment to pass over your cuff. Use a small pair of scissors to cut off any loose, hanging threads. Finishing the Cuff Turn the cuff right-side-out. You will have a sewn tube, with a folded edge along the top, and a raw edge along the bottom. Half of the tube's side seam will be sewn, and the other half will be split open. This split is where your thumb will go. Pin the two outside edges together. Open up the cuff where the split is. Take the two edges that are on the outside of the cuff, and hold them together, with the right sides touching. Insert a pin along the edge on the wrong side of the fabric. You will need to push part of the hem away. You need to pin as far as the stitching will allow. Repeat the process for the two inside edges. Join the two remaining edges together, so that the right sides are touching and the wrong sides are facing out. Push the hem out of the way and insert another pin. Sew along the pinned edge. Begin sewing at one corner and finish sewing at the other. When you reach the center seam/joint, you will have to pause the sewing machine and rotate the cuff. Use a matching thread color, a 1/4-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance, and a stretch or zigzag stitch. Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Remove the pins when you are done. Fold the top layer of fabric down. All of your seams should now be hidden inside the cuff. You'll have something that looks like a regular cuff, except that it has a slit in the side seam. Attaching the Cuff Zigzag stitch along the bottom edge of the cuff. Make sure that the edges of the zigzag go over the edge of the cuff. If you have a serger, you can use this instead. Pin the cuff to the outside of the sleeve, with the aw edges aligned. Slide the cuff onto the sleeve, folded-edge-down. Keep sliding until the bottom, raw edge of the cuff aligns with the bottom, top, raw edge of the sleeve. The thumb slit should  be aligned with the side seam on the sleeve. Sew around the cuff. Use a stretch stitch or a zigzag stitch. Make sure that you are sewing away about from the initial zigzag stitch. This will mean a seam allowance of about \u00bd inch (0.64 centimeters). The cuff may be narrower than the sleeve. In this case, gently pull on the cuff so that it lays flat against the sleeve. For a nicer finish, go back over the edge with a zigzag stitch. You can also use a serger. Turn the cuff up and tuck the seam inside. At this point, your cuff is complete. If you want to, you can press the cuff and sleeve with a hot iron so that it lays flat. Repeat the entire process for the other cuff. There is no need to reverse the pattern for the cuff.",
