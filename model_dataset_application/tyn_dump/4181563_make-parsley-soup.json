          "description":"Once the water is boiling, place 1 pound (450 g) of fresh parsley in the pan. Allow the parsley to cook until the leaves become bright green and wilted. That should take approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute. Keep a careful eye on the parsley so you know when it\u2019s done. If you cook it too long, you may dilute some of its flavor."

Let it sit for approximately 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Drain it in the colander a final time to remove the water. While you\u2019re draining the cold water from the parsley, it\u2019s a good idea to give the leaves a squeeze with a towel or spin them in a salad spinner to ensure that you get rid of any excess moisture."

Be careful not to press on the parsley too hard with the knife or you may bruise the leaves. There\u2019s no need to remove the stems from the parsley. The stems actually have a nice, sharp flavor that works well in the soup, and because it\u2019s eventually pureed, the stems won\u2019t ruin the texture of the soup either."

Turn the heat to medium, and allow the butter to warm until it melts completely, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Cutting the butter in pieces before you place it in the pan can help it melt more quickly. Make sure to stir the butter as it\u2019s melting to ensure that it\u2019s heating evenly."

Allow the mixture to cook on medium heat for approximately 6 minutes or until the onions are soft. Use a wooden spoon to stir the garlic and onions as you heat them to ensure that they cook evenly. Avoid browning the onions; you just want them to be tender, not caramelized."

Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium low heat for approximately 15 to 20 minutes or until it thickens slightly. Stir the mixture occasionally to ensure that it doesn\u2019t scorch on the bottom.
