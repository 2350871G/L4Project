          "description":"Climb a ladder near the corner of your roof and tape the end of your tape measure against the rafter using duct tape. Get off of your ladder and reposition it at the other end of your roof. Pull the tape measure along the length of your roof and climb up the ladder in the new position to take your measurement. Write down your measurement so you don\u2019t forget it later on. Keep taking measurements for any other sections of your roof where you need to install fascia boards. If you\u2019re replacing an old fascia board, you can measure the old board instead of your roof. Never stand on the top step of a ladder since you\u2019ll be more likely to fall."

          "headline":"Get straight boards that are 2 in (5.1 cm) taller than the rafter ends.",
          "description":"Look for boards that are treated for outdoor use since they\u2019ll be more moisture-resistant and prevent rot from developing. Choose boards that are 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick so they fit easily onto the ends of your rafters. The ends of your rafters are usually either 6 or 8 inches (15 or 20 cm) tall, so boards that are 8 or 10 inches (20 or 25 cm) tall will work best. You can buy boards for your fascia from a hardware or home improvement store. Woods made from pine, spruce, or cedar all work well for fascia board. You may not be able to buy boards that are the exact length of your roof. If not, then get as many boards as you need to match the length."

          "headline":"Cut the boards to length you need using a circular saw.",
          "description":"Lay the board you\u2019re cutting on top of 2 saw horses so the side your cutting hangs over the edge. Mark the line on your board so you know where to make your cut. Put on safety glasses before turning on the saw and pushing it through the board. Continue cutting the rest of the boards to the lengths you need. Ask the employees where you bought the boards to see if they can cut them for you if you don\u2019t have the tools at home. You may also use a handsaw if you want, but it will take longer and may not be as precise as a table saw. Always keep your hands and fingers away from the saw blade, or else you could get seriously injured.Tip: If you can\u2019t saw the boards to the exact length you need, then split the measurement between boards of equal length. For example, if you need 24 feet (7.3 m) of fascia board, you can cut 2 boards that are 12 feet (3.7 m) each or 3 boards that are 8 feet (2.4 m) each."

Set the angle of the circular saw blade to match the slope of your roof, and run the saw along the top edge of each fascia board. Wear safety glasses while you\u2019re working with your saw to keep your eyes and face protected. You don\u2019t need to cut the top of the fascia board if you don\u2019t want to, but it will give your home a clean appearance once you\u2019re finished.

          "description":"Set the angle of a miter saw to 45 degrees so you can make clean cuts through the board. Put on your safety glasses, and position the fascia board so the corner on one end lines up with the saw blade. Turn the saw on and pull it down to cut the angle. Cut the ends of any other boards that will be on a corner. Make sure your hands aren\u2019t in the path of the saw while you\u2019re cutting so you don\u2019t seriously injure yourself. Some hardware stores offer miter saw rentals so you can use one without purchasing it. You don\u2019t need to miter the ends of the boards if you don\u2019t want to, but the corners won\u2019t look as clean. You only need to miter the ends of the fascia boards that are on corners."

  "text":" Measuring and Cutting the Fascia Use a tape measure to find the length of your roof. Climb a ladder near the corner of your roof and tape the end of your tape measure against the rafter using duct tape. Get off of your ladder and reposition it at the other end of your roof.
