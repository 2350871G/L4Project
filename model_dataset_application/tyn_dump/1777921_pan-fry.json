          "description":"One or two tablespoons is enough. Tilt the pan to evenly spread the oil over the surface. The best oils to use are flavorless. These include light or refined olive oil, canola oil, and peanut oil. Avoid using extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) if possible. EVOO can burn in the pan when frying because of its lower smoke point. EVOO starts to smoke at 325-375F compared to 465F for light or refined olive oil. Since food starts to fry around 365-375F, your extra-virgin olive oil may begin to burn before it starts to fry, giving your food a bitter taste. If you have no other option, watch the oil carefully. If it starts to smoke, remove from the heat and let it cool before dumping it and trying again."

There are a few tests you can do to see if it is hot enough. Use a cooking thermometer to know the exact heat. Stick the metal end into the oil, and wait 5 seconds for an accurate reading. The oil should be hot enough around 365 degrees F.\nStick the handle of a wooden spoon in it. Bubbles will rise and pop when it is hot. If you don't have a wooden spoon, try a drop of water instead (and no more than a drop). The water will begin to sizzle and pop when the oil is hot enough. This may cause the oil to splatter so be careful. Do not leave your pan unattended while heating it at the stove. It only takes a few minutes for it to heat up, and you do not want to burn the oil or start a fire."

If you overcrowd the pan, the steam will not release, and you may end up with a soggy meal.

The inside can be pink, but not red. Chicken and turkey need internal temperatures of 165 degrees F. The inside should be white, not pink. Juices should run clear. Pork should have an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. The inside should be mostly cooked white or brown, although there may be a slight pink tint.

Place the food on a plate. If you are frying meats such as pork or beef, you may want to let the meat rest for three minutes to keep its juices intact and to let it finish cooking. Serve immediately. Shallow-Frying Add an inch of cooking oil to a skillet. The oil should come halfway up the sides of the pan. Canola, vegetable, sunflower, and light olive oil work well for this type of frying. Batter the food before frying. Have the battered food ready for when the oil is hot. You can check if the oil is hot enough by sticking a wooden spoon into the oil.

Transfer to a paper towel. Once you have removed your food, place them on a paper towel. You can use tongs or a slotted spatula. The paper towel will soak up excess oil, giving you a crispier batter. The meats should rest for a moment to finish cooking. Serve immediately. Stir-Frying Choose a wok. A wok is large pan with sloped sides. Woks are ideal for this type of frying because you can cook in stages. While you can use a skillet for stir-frying, the results will not be as consistent or as tasty. Cut up your meats and vegetables. Stir-frying is similar to saut\u00e9ing in that it requires you to cut up your foods before you cook them. Make sure that all pieces are roughly the same size and weight. This will ensure uniform cooking. Have them all chopped and ready before you heat the pan. Heat up one to two tablespoons of oil. Set the stove to high heat. Stir-frying requires higher heat than other types of pan frying. Peanut oil is best for stir-frying, although you can use canola or vegetable oil. Add your ingredients.
