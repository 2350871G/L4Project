          "description":"Hit the stalks with the flat side of your knife blade to bruise them. This will release the fragrant oil inside of the tough stalks. Then,  carefully give the lemongrass a rough chop. The pieces should be about \u20442\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) long. If you're using home-grown lemongrass, you can use the leaves to make the tea. There\u2019s no need to bruise the leaves, though. Chop the lemongrass on a cutting board so you don't dull your knife blade or damage your countertop! Since lemongrass is often sold already cut if you buy it at a grocery store, the number of stalks you'll need will vary."

          "description":"Once the water reaches a rapid, rolling boil, it\u2019s time to add the lemongrass. Carefully drop the chopped lemongrass directly into the boiling water. If you need to, give it a stir with a long-handled spoon to ensure the lemongrass is completely submerged, then let it steep in the boiling water for about 5 minutes. A rapid boil means if you stir the water, it shouldn't stop bubbling. Hold the lemongrass close to the surface of the water when you drop it in. This will reduce the chances that it will splash back onto you.Tip: If you want to make the tea in a teapot, boil the water, then pour the boiling water and the chopped lemongrass into the teapot. Cover the teapot with a towel or tea cozy and let the mixture steep for 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes fragrant."

Pour the tea through a fine mesh strainer or colander into a pitcher or another container. While lemongrass is perfectly edible, the fibers from the stalks might be an unpleasant addition to a soothing cup of tea. If you like, you can strain the tea directly into your teacup."

If you want to amp up the citrus taste, squeeze a wedge of lime over your tea. Start with about \u20442  tsp (2.5 mL) of lime juice, then add more if you want. The lime will provide more of a contrast to the lemongrass than a lemon, which might mask the subtle flavor of the lemongrass. Tip: You can mix and match any of these flavors, but feel free to get creative with other additions. For instance, you could add a little cinnamon or orange zest, or you could drop in 1-2 drops of your favorite extract, like vanilla, cherry, or coconut!"
