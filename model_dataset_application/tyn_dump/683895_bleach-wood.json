Applications vary depending on the type of varnish or stain remover, so refer to the package directions. They are usually applied with a soft rag, left to sit for a set number of minutes, and then rinsed off with water. Varnish removers are either chemical or citrus based. Chemical removers have strong fumes but can work in as little as 30 minutes. Citrus based removers have less odor but work slower and may require multiple attempts. You usually have to let your wood dry for a day or two after using a varnish or stain remover."
