Making Frayed Flowers Cut a strip of burlap. Make sure you cut along the same direction as the fibers. The width and length of the strip you cut will determine how big your end result will be.

Secure one end of your flower by placing a strip of glue down the length of one end along the edge. Fold the edge over one time and lightly press down to set it in place. Pull a string from the other end. Find one string on the opposite end of the strip between the middle and bottom part of the width. Pull the string away from the rest of the strip. You should end up with a strip of bunched, gathered burlap. Glue both ends together. Take each end of the bunched strip of burlap and circle them around to connect them.
