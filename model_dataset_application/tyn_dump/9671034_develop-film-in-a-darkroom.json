    "Pour out the stop bath and fill the tank with fixer.",
    "Fixer is the last chemical used in the development process.",
    "It helps stabilize your film so it can be exposed to light without getting ruined.",
    "Once your film tank is filled with fixer, seal it and follow the same agitation schedule you used for the developer mixture.",
    "The exact number of minutes you should leave the fixer in the tank depends on the kind of film you\u2019re using, but it\u2019s typically between 3-5 minutes.",
    "You can find film fixer online or at your local photography store.",
    "Rinsing and Drying Your Film Empty out the fixer and rinse your film with cold water.",
    "Now that your film has been soaked in fixer, it\u2019s safe to take the lid off the tank and pull the film reel out.",
    "Thoroughly rinse your film with water for several minutes to remove any leftover chemicals.",
    "Soak the film reel in a container filled with wetting agent for 30 seconds.",
    "Wetting agents help water roll off the film more easily when it\u2019s drying.",
    "If you don\u2019t use a wetting agent, your film could develop streak or bubble marks on it.",
    "You can find a wetting agent online or at your local photography store.",
    "Take the film off the reel and unroll it.",
    "To take the film off the reel, twist the sides of the reel in opposite directions and then pull them apart so the reel separates into 2 pieces.",
    "Then, slide the film off the reel and unroll it with your fingers.",
    "Hang the film up to dry.",
    "Use a clip to hang the film somewhere high up where it can dry, like on a clothesline or wire rack.",
    "Clip one end of the film to the surface you\u2019re hanging it from, and attach another clip to the other end to weigh the film down so it\u2019s taut.",
    "Let the film dry for several hours before you unclip it.",
    "If the darkroom you're in has a film dryer, hang the film up inside of it to speed up the drying time.",
    "With a dryer, it may only take the film 20 minutes to dry.",
    "Storing Your Developed Film Clean the film with a film cleaner to remove any streaks.",
    "Once the film is completely dry, lay it on a flat surface and examine it for streak marks.",
    "If you see any, soak a paper towel in film cleaner and gently wipe it across the surface of the film to remove the streaks.",
    "You can find film cleaner online or at your local photography store.",
    "Cut your film into strips of 5 negatives.",
    "Cutting your film into smaller strips will allow you to store your film in plastic sleeves until you\u2019re ready to print them.",
    "Use scissors to cut the film into strips of 5 along the lines dividing the negatives.",
    "Slide the film strips into plastic sleeves for protection.",
    "It\u2019s important that you keep your developed film safe until you\u2019re ready to turn it into prints.",
    "Plastic sleeves will keep moisture, smudges, and debris from getting on your film.",
    "Leave the film in the plastic sleeves until you\u2019re ready to make some prints out of your negatives.",
    "Store the plastic sleeves in a binder or folder when you're finished.",
    "You can find plastic film sleeves online or at your local photography store."
