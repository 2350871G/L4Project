If the glaze has been sitting out for a while, quickly whisk it again before applying it to the ham. For most hams, you'll need to cook the ham for 15 to 20 minutes per 1 lb (450 g) of meat at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). If you're cooking an 8-lb (3.6-kg) ham, this means you'll need to cook it between 2 to 2-1/2 hours; add this glaze after the first 60 to 90 minutes."
