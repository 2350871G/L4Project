      "description":"Don't get normal surgical gloves or purple ones used for blood work. The gloves need to fit against the skin snugly and not allow capsicum from the peppers to seep through and get into your skin. If you ignore this, the peppers you handle will make your hands have a burning or throbbing sensation for hours, possibly all day. When handling the peppers or seeds, wear these gloves. When through, make sure to wash the gloves well and rinse with plenty of water before removing them. To be extra safe, wash your hands as well and rinse with copious amounts of water. This will prevent the capsicum from the peppers and seeds from irritating your sensitive skin and membranes, should you happen to touch these areas."

      "description":"You will not want to fill the container more than \u00bd to \u00be full of mash because fermentation bubbles will make the mash rise up and overflow the jar. One pound of peppers will produce a little less than a pint of pepper mash, so you will need 5 pounds to fill your gallon jar half full. If you don't process the peppers immediately, refrigerate them."

      "headline":"Get the largest, plumpest, ripe peppers from the garden or market.",
      "description":"Red or orange habanero peppers which have ripened fully on the bush will start rotting within a couple of days after picking them, so use them immediately.Fully ripe peppers have a delicious sweetness to them, in spite of any heat. If you bite into one, you will feel a rush of sweetness, then the heat will hit you and you might regret taking such a big bite. The sugars that give the peppers a sweet taste will help fermentation."

      "headline":"Choose whether to leave the seeds in or remove them.",
      "description":"Contrary to popular opinion, the seeds don't contribute much to the heat of the peppers. The real heat comes from the connecting veins that attach the seeds inside the peppers to the pepper walls. You can always use the seeds for planting more peppers. If you intend to save the seeds for planting, don't save the seeds from puny, stunted peppers. Save those from the biggest, fattest peppers for planting. That way you will have more fat peppers in your next harvest."

      "headline":"Wash the peppers and dry them with a towel or paper towel before processing them.",
      "description":"Do not wash them before refrigerating them. Water makes them decompose faster. If you plan to save the seeds, use a sharp paring knife to slice into each pepper and pry it open with your fingers, then scrape the seeds out, one pepper at a time. Try to leave the veins in the peppers. Set the seeds aside in a small bowl so you can lay them out on a paper towel to dry after you finish."

However, you can still spread them on paper towels and dry them in a food dryer or in an oven at 110\u2109 (43\u2103) for a day. You may then pulverize the seeds in your blender at high speed, then put the resulting dust in a salt or pepper shaker. Instead of using a blender, you may also push the peppers, with or without seeds, through a juice extractor. This will extract the seeds and a good amount of the pulp. Cycle it through the juicer several times to get out as much of the pulp as possible. Use the output of the juicer for the fermentation process. You may also juice additional vegetables as discussed below."

A tablespoon of salt weighs 15 grams and a teaspoon 5 grams. 69.3/15 = 4.62 tablespoons. So, you need four and two-thirds tablespoons of salt for 2100 grams of mash."
