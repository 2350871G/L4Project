  "text":" Pan-Frying Plaice Fillets Heat up the butter in a frying pan. Use a high heat, and you will know that the pan is ready to use once the butter is foaming. A non-stick pan is best and will save you time cleaning. You can substitute oil in the place of butter if preferred. Olive oil goes well with plaice, and 2 tbsp (30 ml) is a good amount to cover the pan and fry to perfection. Place the fillets in the pan and fry the first side for 2 minutes.

Beat together the egg and milk in one bowl to make an egg wash. Then mix together the flour with salt and pepper to taste in a separate bowl. Put the breadcrumbs out on another plate. Dip the fillets into the breadcrumb coating. Dip each plaice fillet into the flour mixture, and shake off any excess. Then dip each fillet into the egg wash.

You will be able to tell that the plaice are cooked through when the flesh has changed from translucent to opaque. The breadcrumb coating will become golden. Grilling Plaice Whole Rinse the fish in water. Use cool running water to gently rinse off the plaice, which removes any sand or grit if it's freshly caught. Make sure to wash your hands well before and after to avoid spreading bacteria around your kitchen. To dry the plaice after rinsing, pat it dry with a paper towel. This also helps to keep the fish from getting tough or mushy when you cook it. Trim off the fins. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to snip off the plaice fins. You can leave the tail on to create an impressive appearance for your dish. Slash the plaice skin with a sharp knife. Make a long slash down the spine, and then 6 diagonal slashes stemming from it, with 3 each side. This makes the fish crispy. Make the slashes on the top side of the fish, which for flatfish such as plaice, is the side that it\u2019s eyes are on. The incisions should be deep, but not go entirely through the fish.
