The placement doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, but the tape needs to be in the right spot so you can cut through it as you cut into the table. It serves as a clever way to protect the granite from the blade, reducing the chances of chip damage. For example, if you\u2019re cutting across the countertop\u2019s length, lay a single strip of tape all the way across it. Try to place it exactly where you plan on cutting. If it isn\u2019t 100% accurate, lay down additional tape to cover the cutting area. Pick up painter\u2019s tape and the other tools you need online or at a local hardware store."

Open nearby doors and windows, then turn on any ventilation fans you have available. Working outdoors is the best bet to prevent the dust from getting all over your home.

You will need a strong blade, usually about 4 in (10 cm) in diameter, labeled for use on granite.

Remember that it\u2019s better to cut within the line if you need to, since you can always cut away the extra granite later.

Repeat the cut with the angle grinder until the hole is sizeable and consistent. For the rounded corners, cut from the center of the hole to the edges of the outline.

Although you still need a diamond blade designed for use on granite, the saw reduces the amount of dust released as you make the cut. If you don\u2019t mind the potential mess from spilled water, use a wet-cut setting to reduce the wear and tear on your saw and blade.

    "Each cut can take as long as 15 minutes to complete, so don\u2019t rush.",
    "Take your time to get a countertop with smooth, unbroken edges.",
    "Making Utility Holes with an Angle Grinder Fit a diamond-tipped blade onto an angle grinder.",
    "Use an angle grinder for a way to slice a hole into a solid countertop.",
    "An angle grinder is a versatile tool that resembles a handheld electric saw.",
    "You will need a strong blade, usually about 4 in (10 cm) in diameter, labeled for use on granite.",
    "Angle grinders are often used for cutting and polishing strong, abrasive materials like stone, but you still have to be careful when selecting the correct cutting wheel.",
    "If you choose the wrong one, you could damage the tool as well as your countertop.",
    "Lower the blade onto the guideline you wish to cut.",
    "Keep the blade close to the edge of the line, being careful to avoid cutting past it.",
    "As you hold the blade perpendicular to the countertop, cut down into the tape and through the granite.",
    "Then, begin moving the blade along the guideline to complete the cut.",
    "Remember that it\u2019s better to cut within the line if you need to, since you can always cut away the extra granite later.",
    "If you cross over the line, you will end up cutting into the part of the countertop you wish to keep and that can\u2019t be fixed.",
    "Cut diagonally across rounded corners to make them easier to finish.",
    "Once you make the initial cut, the rest of the work is simple to complete.",
    "Hold the blade steady with light but consistent pressure as you head toward the corners of the outline.",
    "When you get close to a corner, cut across the stone to the adjacent edge of the outline.",
    "Making straight lines is much easier than trying to cut around a curve, so this will help you get a better-looking countertop.",
    "A slow and steady pace makes for a good countertop.",
    "Trim away the stone instead of trying to force the blade to eliminate large chunks of it.",
    "Trim the hole as needed by cutting along the outline again.",
    "Go back around the hole, cutting it until it\u2019s even with the outline you drew during the measurement phase.",
    "Chances are the hole won\u2019t be big enough after the first cut, especially if you were cautious with it.",
    "Widening it is a simple process, however.",
    "Repeat the cut with the angle grinder until the hole is sizeable and consistent.",
    "For the rounded corners, cut from the center of the hole to the edges of the outline.",
    "Move the blade in straight lines to slice off small chunks of the granite each time.",
    "Eventually, you will end up with perfect, round corners.",
    "Fit the appliance into the countertop.",
    "If you have a drop-in sink or cooktop, lower it into the hole you cut.",
    "Otherwise, raise it up from underneath the countertop.",
    "Make sure it fits perfectly before you secure it in place with a silicone sealant.",
    "If you measured well enough when sketching the cutlines, you won\u2019t need to make any extra adjustments.",
    "Sometimes the hole is smaller than you need, but you can even out the edges with an angle grinder.",
    "You can\u2019t fix a hole that is too big, so cut with caution!",
    "Using a Wet-Cut Saw or Grinder Choose a wet-cut circular saw with a diamond-tipped blade.",
    "A wet-cut saw is a type of circular saw with an attached nozzle that shoots a jet of water at the granite as you cut it.",
    "Although you still need a diamond blade designed for use on granite, the saw reduces the amount of dust released as you make the cut.",
    "If you don\u2019t mind the potential mess from spilled water, use a wet-cut setting to reduce the wear and tear on your saw and blade.",
    "You could also use a regular circular saw or angle grinder while spraying water onto the countertop.",
    "If you\u2019re careful to avoid electrical shock, this is easy to do without buying a wet-cut saw.",
    "Plug the saw into a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet.",
    "Set up your workstation near a special outlet than can deactivate if needed to prevent an electrical shock.",
    "A GFCI outlet has a red \u201creset\u201d button on it that pops out when the circuit gets overloaded.",
    "You can then look for any problems and press the reset button when you\u2019re ready to continue operating the saw.",
    "If you can, plan on cutting the countertop outdoors, using an extension cord as needed to connect to the outlet.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a GFCI outlet available, use the dry-cut method instead to eliminate the risk of shock.",
    "Slice into the countertop along the outline you drew.",
    "Fit the saw over the outline you drew on the tape.",
    "Use the line to guide your saw all the way around the countertop.",
    "Instead of pushing the saw forward with force, hold onto it with a light amount of pressure.",
    "Guide it gradually over the lines to get perfect, smooth cuts.",
    "Work slowly and make sure you cut where you need to.",
    "You can\u2019t put back anything you remove, so you could ruin a good countertop if you\u2019re not careful.",
    "If you\u2019re cutting a hole, such as for a sink, cut diagonally across rounded corners.",
    "Come back and trim off the excess granite once you\u2019re finished making the rest of the hole.",
    "Spray the saw blade to keep it moist as it works.",
    "The water is what makes a wet cut different from a dry one.",
    "If you\u2019re using a wet-cut circular saw, its nozzle will spray water automatically as you use it.",
    "Keep the taped area and saw blade well-soaked, but make sure the water doesn\u2019t reach the saw\u2019s electrical cord or motor chamber.",
    "If you\u2019re using a regular saw or angle grinder, you will need a hose, spray bottle, or something similar.",
    "Have someone else add the water to make the process easier.",
    "Expect some standing water on the countertop.",
    "As long as you keep the saw\u2019s motor above the water, you won\u2019t have any problems.",
    "Avoid standing in any puddles of water and keep the cord behind you to eliminate the risk of shock.",
    "Wipe the cut edges off with a damp rag.",
    "Wet-cut saws leave a moist paste of granite fragments on the countertops.",
    "It\u2019s very easy to remove with an old rag dampened in cold water.",
    "Clean off the countertop and your workspace.",
    "If you worked outdoors, wash away any fragments on the ground with a spray of water from a garden hose.",
    "Be careful of the standing water left from the cutting process.",
    "Move the saw out of the way, then wipe it up before you begin installing the countertop or its features."
