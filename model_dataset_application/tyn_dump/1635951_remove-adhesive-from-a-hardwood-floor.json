  "text":" Removing Adhesive with Hot Water and Towels Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place a pot with 4-6 cups of water on the stove, and wait for it to boil. You could also use an electric kettle to bring your water to a boiling point. Soak towels in the hot water. Use old towels that are already stained or dingy, but still clean. Saturate them completely with hot water. Be careful not to scald your hands. Place the wet towels on the floor. This keeps the hot water contained and allows it to rest over the surface of the adhesive, heating it up and loosening it. Leave towels in place. Leave the towels in place for 3-5 minutes. Then wipe the surface of the floors with the towels. The adhesive should be melted enough to start coming off. Scrape any stubborn adhesive off with a floor scraper. Gently run the floor scraper over the surface of any remaining adhesive. Be careful not to seriously scratch or damage your floor. Removing Adhesive with a Heat Gun Locate a heat gun. The purpose of using the heat gun is to reheat the adhesive for easy removal. Plug in the heat gun and ensure it will reach your work area. You may need to use an extension cord. Apply heat to the adhesive. Direct the heat gun toward the adhesive. Place the heat gun as close to the adhesive as possible without touching it. Continue until you see the adhesive begin to give and melt. Wipe the area with a dry towel. Use an old, but clean, towel to begin to wipe away the melted adhesive. You may want to re-heat the adhesive and wipe again. Use a scraper to lift any leftover residue. Carefully move your floor scraper over the surface of any remaining adhesive. Move gently enough to avoid damaging your floor. Removing Adhesive with a Commercial Product Purchase a commercial glue/adhesive remover. These products are especially helpful for removing tough carpet adhesive (which have replaced tack strips in recent years). You can find a product like this at any hardware store. Wear gloves, protective eyewear, and a mask. Commercial adhesive removers are very strong. It is important for you to put on rubber gloves to protect your hands from any chemicals. You should also wear protective eyewear and a mask. Test the adhesive remover. It\u2019s a good idea to test the adhesive remover first to see if it works well. Choose a small area, like a closet, to see if the adhesive remover works well or if it has a negative reaction, such as staining your wood. Pour a small amount of adhesive remover onto a damp sponge. Begin with just a small amount of adhesive remover (this product is very powerful), following the instructions listed on the package. Then, using your sponge, apply the adhesive remover to the adhesive on your floor. Give it some time. Leave the adhesive remover on long enough to loosen the adhesive (approximately five minutes, or according to the manufacturer's instructions). Use a scraper to remove any residue. Once again, work carefully with the scraper, using soft motions and taking care not to gouge your hardwood floor. Removing Adhesive with Dry Ice Gather supplies. You are going to need gloves, protective eyewear, a metal cookie sheet or tray, and a \u00bd lb (227-gram) block of dry ice. Dry ice can be purchased at many grocery stores, as well as some hardware stores. Put on your gloves and protective eyewear. As with the commercial adhesive remover, dry ice is quite powerful. It is necessary for you to protect your hands and eyes by wearing rubber gloves and protective eyewear whenever you handle dry ice. Place your \u00bd lb block of dry ice on a metal cookie sheet or tray. Using a gloved hand, center your \u00bd lb block of dry ice on a metal cookie sheet. The cookie sheet should be large enough to cover the area where you\u2019d like to remove the adhesive. If it is not, you can always repeat this process. Place the tray directly on top of the adhesive and allow it to sit for 1 minute. The dry ice will harden and then crack the adhesive. This is perhaps the quickest and cleanest method of loosening and removing floor adhesive. Remove the tray and use a scraper to lift off the cracked pieces of adhesive. As always, use gentle pressure and soft motions, as you do not want to damage your floor.",
