          "description":"Tuberose bulbs are best planted in early spring after the last frost, but this requires a warm climate with a growing season at least 4 months long, and a USDA hardiness zone of 8, 9, or 10. If you have a shorter growing season, start the tuberose indoors in early spring and transfer once night temperatures outdoors are above 60\u00baF (15.5\u00baC). If you live in zone 7 or below, you will need to bring tuberose indoors for the winter. Zones 8-10 correspond to a minimum winter temperature between 10\u00baF (-12.2\u00baC) and 35\u00baF (1.7\u00baC). Zone 7 has a minimum winter temperature of 0\u00baF (-17.8\u00baC)."
