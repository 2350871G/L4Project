Write a Christmas greeting on it, then decorate it with Christmas-themed washi tape and stickers. Wrap it around your jar, then overlap the ends in the back and glue them in place. Add a strip of double-sided tape to the back of the label first so that it doesn't slide off the jar. You can also design the label on the computer, or print a template off of the internet instead. \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d is a popular greeting, but you can also use \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d and \u201cSeason\u2019s Greetings\u201d instead. Fill the jar with anything, from spa kits to pet supplies to food."

          "description":"Remove the lid from a mason jar, spray paint it a festive color, then let the paint dry. Choose a festive ribbon the same width as the jar lid, then hot glue it around the lid, overlapping the ends by \u20442 in (1.3 cm). Red, green, or white are classic colors, but you can use others too. Blue is perfect for a Winter Wonderland theme, while silver or gold will look more elegant. If you can't find ribbon, use washi tape instead! It comes in all sorts of colors and patterns, and you can find it in the scrapbooking section of a craft store. You can do one or the other, or even both! Leaving the lid unpainted will give you a rustic touch. The ribbon needs to cover the sides on the jar lid. If it's too wide, it will stick out over the top edge of the jar, but it it's too narrow, you'll see the sides of the lid."

          "description":"Cut 1 to 2 holly leaves out of green felt or paper, punch a hole near the stem, then thread them onto a piece of twine. Add a red jingle bell to the twine, then wrap it around the lid of a mason jar. Tie the twine into a bow, then slide the jingle bell and leaves towards the bow. If you're using paper, crease the leaves in half lengthwise for a more realistic touch. Holly leaves look like pointed ovals or almonds with scalloped edges."

Tuck a gift card into the scene, then screw the jar on. Paint the jar lid a festive color, such as red, green, or white. Don't add glitter to the jar. You won't be able to fill it with water, so the glitter won't be visible. If you can't get stuffing, pull apart a cotton ball, and use that instead."

Add a red or black pompom for the nose. Finally, wrap brown pipe cleaners around the top of the jar, then bend them into antler shapes. If you don't have brown paper, paint the strip instead using brown acrylic paint. The length of the strip will depend on the size of the jar. Make it long enough so that you can overlap the ends by \u20442 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm). Fill the jar with any assortment of small gifts, such as candy, cat toys, spa items, etc."

Industrial-strength glue is another option if you don't mind the couple-hour-long wait. Use burlap ribbon for a rustic touch, or satin ribbon for a fancier look.

Wrap a festive, red-and-white or burlap ribbon around the neck of the jar for a festive touch. How long the paint takes to dry depends on the brand, so check the instructions on the back of the paint bottle. Expect to wait around 20 minutes, however. Lightly sand the raised designs of the jar for a rustic look. Use a foam brush or a wide, synthetic brush to apply the paint. Clean the brush between each paint color that you use."
