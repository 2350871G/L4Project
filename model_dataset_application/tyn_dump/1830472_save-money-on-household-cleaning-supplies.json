In most cases, you can save money per product unit when you buy mass quantities of a specific product from stores such as Costco or Sam's Club. Some warehouse stores charge an annual membership fee to be able to purchase from them. Be aware that this might be the policy of some stores before you purchase. Also consider looking for bulk retailers online. Often, you can buy in bulk or wholesale with relative ease in an online marketplace."

          "description":"In most cases, grocery stores, drug stores, and big box stores will sell their own line of cleaning products that contain similar or identical ingredients to those found in brand name products. These generic products are generally cheaper than name brand with no real difference in quality or contents. Compare the ingredients and directions for use between store-brand products and name brands to verify that the products are similar to one another before purchasing. Look for cleaning supplies at dollar stores and discount retailers. These stores often carry generic lines that work as well as name brand for a fraction of the cost."

Reusable products may cost a bit more in the beginning, but you\u2019ll get more use out of them than a box of similar disposable products. Do remember that while it is cost-saving to buy reusable supplies, the supplies should be replaced in the manufacturer recommended timeframe. Waiting to replace supplies could lead to bacterial growth and unsanitary conditions."

In most cases, companies will provide you with coupons or discounts via email that you can print out and use at retail stores. You may also be able to get discounts by signing up for your market\u2019s loyalty program. Where available, these programs offer members reduced prices on a rotating selection of items."

Create a cleaning calendar that helps you rotate out a few cleaning areas every day of the week. For example, you may choose to scrub the bathroom every Monday, the Kitchen every Wednesday, and vacuum the carpets every Sunday. Dedicate 20 to 30 minutes each day for household cleaning. Set a consistent time each day such as right after you wake up or an hour before bed to be your cleaning time."

Vinegar is also usually significantly lower in price than commercial household cleaning products. Mix equal parts white vinegar with equal parts water, then pour the solution into an empty spray bottle. Spray the vinegar and water mixture onto countertops and fixtures that need cleaning anywhere in your home, especially in your kitchen and bathrooms.

Liquid dish soap can be combined with water or hydrogen peroxide to remove stains from carpet, clothing, and windows, and is significantly cheaper than most other commercial household cleaning products. Add 2 to 3 drops of liquid dish soap to a dish or bottle, then add warm water to the soap to create a sudsy and soapy cleaning solution. Add a teaspoon of peroxide for increased potency. Dip a rag, soft cloth, or brush into the soap and water mixture, then use the rag or brush to scrub away stains. Rinse the soap residue away with a rag or towel soaked in fresh, clean water.
