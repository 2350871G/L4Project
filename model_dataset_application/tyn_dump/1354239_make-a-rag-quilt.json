  "text":" Planning Your Design Select fabrics of similar weights and complimentary colors. For the best results, you need fabric that will fray, so consider 100 percent cotton or denim for your rag quilt. Make sure if you are using old material from around the home or the bottom of your quilting box that you have enough to complete the whole quilt. Calculate the desired area of your finished quilt. Multiply the length times the width. Divide that number by 7 to determine how many squares you will need. Divide the number of squares by 6. This assumes a fabric width of 45 inches (114.3 cm).

You could always work with different sizes of squares or a larger or smaller quilt--just make sure you factor in the seam to your final size; you lose an inch on either side with each square. Creating Your Quilt Place two squares together with the wrong sides up. Stitch them, using a 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) seam allowance. Unlike the usual sewing project, the wrong sides are together so that the seams will be visible on top of the squares. You are welcome to use a smaller seam, but that will result in less of a fraying effect. Add another square to the side of the pair you have just stitched.

This will help the seams become soft and fluffy.",
