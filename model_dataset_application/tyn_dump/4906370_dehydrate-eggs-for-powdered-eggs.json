          "headline":"Beat the eggs.",
          "description":"Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs, regardless of whether you are using whole eggs or separated whites and yolks. Alternatively, you could beat the eggs thoroughly by placing them in a food processor or blender and mixing them on medium speed for about a minute. If you separated the whites and the yolks, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form and the egg yolks until they become thick and foamy."

          "headline":"Scramble the eggs.",
          "description":"Break open the eggs and lightly beat them with a fork or whisk. Pour the mixture into a nonstick skillet and cook for several minutes, stirring often, until the eggs are set but still soft. Use a nonstick skillet and do not cook the eggs with any added oil or butter. Fats will lower the shelf-life and make the powdered eggs go rancid quicker. Similarly, you should not add any milk, cheese, or other ingredients to the eggs before dehydrating them. Break the eggs up with your spatula as you cook them. Smaller pieces will dehydrate quicker and more evenly."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Alternatively, hard boil the eggs.",
          "description":"Cook the eggs in boiling water for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the boiled eggs, peel them, and chop the whites and yolks into small pieces. You can either separate the whites and yolks or keep them together. To hard boil eggs, place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cold water. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium to medium-high heat. Once the water reaches a boil, turn off the heat and place a lid on the saucepan. Allow the eggs to finish cooking in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. You can determine whether or not the egg is hard boiled by spinning it on its side on a hard table or counter. An egg that spins fast is hard boiled. An egg that spins slowly is soft boiled. Cool the eggs in cold water as soon as you remove them from the saucepan. Doing this sooner makes it easier to remove the shell. If you plan on dehydrating the whites and yolks separately, separate them before you chop them into pieces."
