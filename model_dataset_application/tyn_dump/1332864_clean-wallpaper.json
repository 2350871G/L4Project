          "description":"Figure out what kind of wallpaper you have on your walls. Vinyl wallpaper is not difficult to clean. Coated fabric wallpaper is sometimes covered with an acrylic or vinyl covering that is easily washable. Plain paper wallpaper should not get wet. If possible, you should spot-clean it. You can scrub vinyl wallpaper, but you need to make sure that you don\u2019t clean with anything abrasive. You wouldn\u2019t want to use a rough sponge, for example. Clean walls that don\u2019t have protective coating with a dry sponge. A dry sponge, which contains no moisture, gently gets rid of the dirt on your wallpaper.

Filip Boksa\t\t\tCleaning Guru, King of Maids\t\t\t\tHow you clean depends on the type of wallpaper you have. Semi-gloss and glossy finish is easy to clean, but you should avoid using liquids on wallpaper that feels more porous like a brown paper bag. You can clean most modern paper with a dampened sponge and multipurpose cleaner. Start at the top and work downwards. Make sure your sponge is not over saturated."

If it doesn\u2019t damage the wallpaper, start the cleaning process. Wipe the surface from the top to the bottom. Clean in the direction of the vertical seams. Clean one section at a time in a circular motion. Don\u2019t overuse soap. Using a large amount of soap will make dirt stick to walls. You may not want to use scrubbing pads because they are usually too harsh for wallpaper\nTesting the cleaning solution in a small, hidden area prevents you from damaging the entire wall in case the cleaner turns out to be destructive. The surface near the baseboards is rarely noticeable to others, and is a good spot to test. EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSusan Stocker\t\t\tGreen Cleaning Expert\t\t\t\tMake sure to wring out your cloth very well to avoid saturating the wallpaper. Water can cause the glue on wallpaper to fail. In addition, older wallpaper can disintegrate very easily, and water can hasten that deterioration. Use a microfiber cloth that's just moistened with water and gently rub the paper.
