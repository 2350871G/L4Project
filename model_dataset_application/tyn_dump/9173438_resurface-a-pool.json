Add up the total square footage of your pool and multiply it by 6 to get a ballpark estimate of how much you can expect to spend. Certain longer-lasting surfacing materials like fiberglass or tile may add considerably to the overall cost of your project.

    "Apply fiberglass in multiple coats.",
    "Starting with a thin seal coat, user a paint roller or sprayer to cover the walls and floor of the pool with the flexible liquid.",
    "Spray a coat of resin over the top, then roll and sand the layers to smooth them before leaving them to cure.",
    "The completed finish should be roughly 3/16\u201d thick.",
    "Fiberglass clings to whatever it touches, so be sure to wear a change of old clothes that you don\u2019t mind ruining.",
    "Allow the new surface to dry.",
    "No matter what material you decide on, it will need plenty of time to set up once it\u2019s in place.",
    "A basic epoxy paint will usually dry in a matter of hours or overnight, while more temperamental materials like plaster and fiberglass may require days to cure completely.",
    "Plaster cures best underwater, so there\u2019s no need to hold off on refilling your pool once the initial set is complete.",
    "Inspect the pool inside and out.",
    "Double check that the plumbing fixtures and lighting elements are properly sealed and functional before you begin adding water to the pool.",
    "This will also be your last chance to take care of any last minute details like sanding or touching up bare spots you may have missed.",
    "Never fill a swimming pool with visible holes, cracks or exposed concrete.",
    "This can easily lead to leaks, which are very expensive to repair and will force you to drain the pool all over again.",
    "Bad wiring in underwater lights could become a safety hazard when swimming.",
    "Refill the pool.",
    "Once the new surface materials have dried, the only thing left to do is fill the pool up with fresh water.",
    "Don\u2019t forget to add the right proportions of chlorine or salt to balance the water\u2019s pH levels and keep unwanted flora and fauna from moving in.",
    "You\u2019ll now be able to enjoy a dip in your newly renovated pool!",
    "A water truck or hydrant will allow you to refill your pool much faster than a standard garden hose."
