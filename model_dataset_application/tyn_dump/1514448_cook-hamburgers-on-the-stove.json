  "text":" Making the Patties Buy good beef with a meat to fat ratio of 80/20. If your beef is too lean, it won't cook up well as a burger. Avoid anything that's 90% or above, for instance. If you want to go a little leaner, 85/15 will work, but 80/20 is a better option. Try buying beef that's freshly ground at the butcher counter for the best quality.

Getting the Patties in the Skillet Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Place the pan on the stove, and turn the burner on high. Let the pan heat up on its own before you put the burgers in. You can splash a little water in to see if it's ready. If the water instantly sizzles, the pan is likely hot enough. You can also use a griddle pan or another type of skillet, but a cast iron skillet helps sear the crust. Salt the patties right before you cook them.

The patties should start making noise as soon as they're in the skillet, beginning to create a nice, seared crust. If you have one, use a splatter screen to avoid popping grease from the pan.
