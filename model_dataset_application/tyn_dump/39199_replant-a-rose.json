Use a fertilizer specifically meant for roses after you replant your rose. Replanting Rose Cuttings Take cuttings in the late spring or early summer if possible. The ideal time to regrow roses is during warm seasons, before the intense heat sets in. Make cuttings in the late spring or early summer when stems are young but strong. The warmth will promote fast root growth. Cuttings can also be made and replanted in the autumn, but root regrowth will happen slowly and new blooms will only appear the following spring, if successful. Cut off healthy stems about 5\u20138 inches (13\u201320 cm) long. Use sharp pruners to make cuttings to avoid crushing the stems. Aim for cuttings that are between 5\u20138 inches (13\u201320 cm) long. Make 45 degree angle cuts. Take cuttings from the top and sides of the plant. Mist the cuttings with water as you replant them to keep them from wilting. The 5\u20138 inches (13\u201320 cm) should not include the flower at the top. Sanitize your cutting tools before and after you cut the plant. Remove the flower from the stem. Use your pruners to remove the rose bloom from the rest of the stem. This will allow the plant to refocus energy that was directed to the flower to grow new roots. Make this cut at a 45-degree angle. Keep some leaves on the stem when you replant it. Leaves provide sugars from photosynthesis to the rose cutting, which will help it grow new roots. Keep 2-3 leaves on each stem, located high up. Note that some varieties of roses will grow from leafless stems, but the odds of regrowth are better with a few leaves still attached. Leaves can also provide root-promoting hormones to the plant.
