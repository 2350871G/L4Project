          "description":"Concrete's volume (the amount of physical space it takes up) is typically measured in either cubic yards (yds) or cubic meters (m). A cubic yard is a 3-dimensional cube that is 3 feet long in each dimension, while a cubic meter is a cube that is 1 meter long in each dimension. Typically, bags of dry concrete mix will specify the volume of \"wet\" concrete each bag will make when properly mixed with water. Below are rough estimates for how many bags of dry concrete mix it takes to make one cubic meter of wet concrete:40 kg bag: 56 bags to make 1 cubic meter\n32 kg bag: 71 \" \" \" 1 cubic meter\n26 kg bag: 86 \" \" \" 1 cubic meter"

          "description":"Compared to other 3-D shapes, a rectangular prism's volume is relatively easy to calculate, so, if possible, it is best to break your entire project up into one or more rectangular prisms. For example, if your project calls for you to pour a single rectangular slab-on-grade, that slab would be your only prism. However, if you need to pour a slab along with 4 straight walls, each wall would be its own prism, resulting in a total of 5 prisms. A rectangular prism is a three-dimensional shape with six faces, all of which are rectangles; opposite faces in a rectangular prism are parallel to each other. In layman's terms, a rectangular prism can be thought of as any \"boxy\" shape with straight edges."

For our volume equation to work, all measurements must be in the same units, so we must convert. Since there are 12 inches per foot, we should divide our inch value by 12 to get a value for feet. The slab is 4 / 12 = 0.33 feet deep. To convert from centimeters to meters, simply divide a centimeter value by 100. A slab that is 10.16 cm deep is 10.16 / 100 = 0.10 meters deep.

If you have a spread footing in your concrete design, for example, you can't accurately approximate its shape using rectangular prisms. To find the volume of an irregular form, first find the area of a cross-section of the form. Then, multiply that area times the length of the form. For example, if a spread footing is 3 yards (2.74 m) long and has a cross-sectional area of 0.25 square yards (0.21 square meters), then the volume is 3 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.75 cubic yards (or 2.74 \u00d7 0.21 = 0.58 cubic meters). Additionally, some common non-rectangular shapes have convenient equations to find their volume. Below are a few of the most common:\nCylinders: Volume = (Pi)r \u00d7 h, where \"r\" is the radius of the circle at either end of the cylinder and \"h\" is the height of the cylinder. Triangular Prisms : Volume = 1/2bh1 \u00d7 l, where \"b\" is the length of the base of one of the triangular faces, \"h1\" is its height, and \"l\" is the length of the prism. Spheres: Volume = (4/3)(Pi)r, where \"r\" is the radius of the circle that represents the sphere's circumference. While it's unlikely that you'll ever have to pour a perfect sphere, note that many dome-like shapes are just spheres cut in half."

For instance, if you have figured a total volume of 20 cubic yards (15.3 cubic meters), then you should order 1.05 \u00d7 20 = 21 cubic yards (or 1.05 \u00d7 15.3 = 16.1 cubic meters).

    "Contractors have devised a quick, easy system of determining how much concrete yardage is needed for a given pour.",
    "This method doesn't require you to use any volume equations - however, there are two stipulations for its use.",
    "First, it only works for rectangular prisms (basic \"box-shaped\" pours).",
    "This method is easiest for relatively shallow pours, but it's possible for all rectangular prisms.",
    "Second, it requires that your pour area's length, and width measurements be in feet and that its depth measurement be in inches.",
    "To convert any of your measurements to feet, use the conversion factors below:\n1 yard = 3 feet\n12 inches = 1 foot\n1 meter = 3.28 feet\n30.48 centimeters = 1 foot Find the square footage of the area you're pouring.",
    "Square footage (written \"sq.",
    "ft\" or ft) is a measure of 2-dimensional area typically used to describe floor space.",
    "To determine your concrete job's square footage, simply multiply the length and width of the area you're pouring into without taking into account its depth.",
    "For example, let's say we're pouring into a rectangular prism that is 10 ft wide, 5 feet long, and 6 inches (0.5 feet) deep.",
    "Its square footage would be 10 \u00d7 5 = 50 sq.",
    "feet.",
    "We don't need to worry about its depth yet.",
    "Remember, this method only works for rectangular prisms.",
    "In other words, your pour area must have straight vertical edges.",
    "Divide your square footage by a numerical coefficient.",
    "Now that you've found your square footage, all you need to do to find your project's concrete yardage is to divide the square footage by a certain number - the thicker your project, the smaller the number; the thinner your project, the larger the number.",
    "Below are coefficients for a few common thicknesses.",
    "If your project's thickness isn't listed below, don't worry - you'll learn how to easily figure out your coefficient in the next step.",
    "If your project is 4 inches thick, divide your square footage by 81 to determine your yardage.",
    "If your project is 6 inches thick, \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  54.",
    "If your project is 8 inches thick, \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  40.",
    "If your project is 12 inches (1 foot) thick, \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  27.",
    "Determine odd coefficients manually.",
    "If the thickness of your concrete pour doesn't  match any of the examples above, you can quickly calculate it by dividing 324 by the thickness of your concrete project (in inches).",
    "Then, divide your square footage by your answer to find your project's yardage.",
    "For example, let's say our 50 sq.",
    "ft concrete pour is 7 inches deep.",
    "We would find our concrete yardage as follows:\n324/7 = 46.28\n50/46.28 = 1.08 cubic yards."
