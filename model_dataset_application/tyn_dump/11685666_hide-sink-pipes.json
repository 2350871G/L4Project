          "headline":"Take measurements around and beneath your sink.",
          "description":"Use a soft measuring tape to determine the circumference or perimeter of your sink\u2019s bowl. Once you have an exact measurement, write it down so you can remember it later. Next, measure the distance between the lower rim of your sink bowl and the floor. Add this measurement to your notes, so you can figure out how much material you need to cover your sink. If you\u2019re measuring a circular sink, hold 1 end of the tape along the left side of the bowl\u2019s rim, then drag it around the curve of the bowl until you reach the right side of the sink. If your sink is especially large, you might want to ask a friend or family member for help. If you\u2019re measuring a square or rectangular sink, measure the right, left, front, and back sides of the sink individually (if applicable). Take note of each separate measurement, then add them all together to get an idea of your sink\u2019s perimeter. If you want, you can use a meter stick or metal measuring tape for this. A sink skirt is attached beneath the rim of your sink. Depending on the type of sink you have, the location of this rim may vary. For instance, a pedestal sink generally has a curved rim. For instance, if your sink is 13 by 17 in (33 by 43 cm), your sink skirt would need to be at least 43 in (110 cm).Tip: You can buy a sink skirt online for under $10. Some stores list them as \u201csink curtains.\u201d"

          "description":"Lay out a piece of fabric that\u2019s at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger on each side than the dimensions you just measured. Use a pen and a meter stick or measuring tape to sketch out the full size of your sink skirt along with the 2 in (5.1 cm) of hem allowance. Once the full skirt length plus the extra hem is sketched out, use a pair of fabric scissors to cut out the section of fabric. You can find fabric at any store that sells craft supplies. Try to select a thicker material, like canvas or burlap. Consider reusing old curtains for this type of project. For instance, if your sink is 12 by 15 in (30 by 38 cm), you\u2019d cut out a section of fabric that\u2019s at least 41 in (100 cm)."

To hold the hem in place, use a sewing needle or sewing machine to stitch along the folded edge of the hem.

Make sure that the sink has the hooked portion of the Velcro while the skirt has the looped side (or vice versa).
