          "description":"If you\u2019re buying a prepackaged turkey, there's a good chance that your turkey contains a few extra organs (or giblets), such as the kidney, liver, heart, and gizzard, in the cavity of the turkey. Remove these and set them aside. Sometimes, the giblet pouch is in the neck cavity instead of the main body cavity. You may also find the neck in 1 of these cavities. A good idea for the giblets is to incorporate them into your stuffing recipe. Saut\u00e9 them in a bit of butter or oil and add them sparingly to most stuffing recipes for added flavor. Many people choose to make broth or stock from the innards of the turkey. Cut them up, along with a diced onion, a couple carrots, as well as a couple stalks of celery, and add them to a pot of boiling water. Add a bit of salt, peppercorns, and several bay leaves to the pot and boil for several hours, skimming the foam off the top every so often."

          "description":"A brine is a bath of flavored salt water that you soak your bird in for 24 hours before smoking it. Brining your turkey will add extra flavor and help it stay moist during the cooking process. Here is a basic brine recipe you can try for your turkey:\nWarning: To avoid splashing harmful germs around your kitchen, don\u2019t rinse a raw turkey unless it\u2019s brined. To rinse the brined turkey safely, put it in a clean sink and cover the area around the sink with paper towels. Carefully rinse the turkey cavity under cool, running water, and wash the sink and surrounding area with soap and hot water when you\u2019re done. Bring 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in a large saucepan. To it, add 4 cups (1 kg) of salt, 4 cups (800 g) of sugar, 1 bulb of garlic (cut in half), 1 cup (192 g) of black peppercorns, and your choice of fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, lavender, sage, and marjoram all work well). Turn off the heat and allow the salt and sugar to dissolve completely. Let the mixture steep for 5 minutes. Add the basic brine to a large cooler filled with 3 bags of ice and stir it. To the cooler, add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of apple cider, and 4 each of lemons and oranges, sliced in half. Submerge your turkey in the cooler, making sure it is entirely covered with liquid. Let your bird soak for at least 24 hours, turning the turkey every 6 to 12 hours. Try to keep the cooler in a cold place; if the temperature of the brine goes above 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C), add extra ice to keep the solution cool and prevent the growth of bacteria. Be sure to rinse your turkey after brining it, otherwise the meat may be saltier than you would like."

Sprinkle it with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasoning. Get creative! A dry rub is a combination of dry spices that you rub into the skin of the turkey, coating it in flavor. For a basic but classic holiday rub, try a combination of kosher salt, pepper, dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried sage, and garlic powder. A glaze is a thick, usually syrupy mixture that is brushed onto meat and which reduces once cooked, concentrating its flavors. Consider going with this holiday-themed glaze consisting of cranberry juice, maple syrup, apple cider, and brown sugar. Who says smoking a turkey needs to be fancy? Give basic seasoning a try. Coat the turkey liberally with oil or softened butter and rub salt and pepper over its skin. You're ready to cook."

Complement the flavor of the chips with a tasty soaking liquid. Experiment with different wood chips to alter the flavor of the meat. Milder flavors of wood chips include alder, apple, cherry, grape, maple, mulberry, orange, and peach; stronger flavors include hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, walnut, and whiskey barrel.
