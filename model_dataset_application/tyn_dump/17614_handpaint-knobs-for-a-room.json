      "description":"Unfinished knobs are available in a variety of materials, each requiring a different preparation. Wooden knobs will need to be sanded lightly with 220 grit sandpaper to remove any surface irregularities. You may prefer not to use primer if you like the grain of the wood to show through a bit. Metal knobs will need to be primed with a spray metal primer (i.e. Rust Oleum). Resin knobs require the least prep--a light sanding with 220 grit if the surface is uneven. No primer required--just start painting!"

A couple lines for a stripe, a few more for a plaid. You can base your designs on the fabrics and wallpaper in the room.
