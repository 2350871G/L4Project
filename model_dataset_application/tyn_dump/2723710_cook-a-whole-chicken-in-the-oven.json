  "text":" Preparing Roast Chicken Defrost your whole chicken. Depending upon the size of the bird, it can take between 1 and 3 days to defrost in the refrigerator. It is recommended that you cook soon after defrosting to avoid food borne illness. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius). Place a rack in the middle to low middle of the oven, depending upon the size of the whole chicken. Clear a space in your kitchen near the sink. Remove other kitchen appliances, dishes and silverware to reduce cross contamination. Ready your roasting pan or Dutch oven nearby for easy transfer. Remove the chicken from its packaging. Place the packaging directly in the trash. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity. Throw them away if you do not want to use them for a gravy. Place your hand near the opening of the cavity, with the breast upward. Stick your fingers between the breast and the skin. Move your hands underneath the skin to loosen it for seasoning. Wash your hands for 30 seconds before handling any other ingredients or dishes.  Flavoring Whole Chicken Decide upon what seasonings you would like to use.

Place them inside the cavity of the chicken. Make sure there aren't any ingredients falling out; however, it can be tightly packed.

Allow it to roast at 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes. This will brown the bird and seal in juices. Turn the oven down to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Let it roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes, depending upon the size of the bird, the evenness of the oven and the altitude. Insert a roasting thermometer into the thigh. It should read at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius). If it does not, allow it to roast for 20 to 30 more minutes before checking again. Resting the Chicken Remove the pan from the oven. Place the chicken on an unheated surface or a cooling rack. Place aluminum foil over the chicken to keep the heat in.  Allow it to rest with the breast up for 10 to 15 minutes.  Turn the chicken over and allow it to rest for 10 more minutes.  Carve and serve.
