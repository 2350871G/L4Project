      "headline":"Take cover.",
      "description":"Don't just run into a room full of zombies without thinking. Try to find cover. Walls work especially good for this. You can also use other enemies as cover. Make sure you always have some cover to fall back to if your health starts to get low."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Have multiple weapons.",
      "description":"You will start the first level with nothing but a pistol. Make sure you get more weapons! A pistol will not last you forever. When you play the more challenging levels of the game it's almost impossible to survive with only a pistol. Collect many different weapons as different weapons are more effective against different monsters. You can find weapons by killing certain enemies or through a secret."

    {
      "headline":"Play often.",
      "description":"Learn each level inside and out and memorize them. Know where the good weapons are, power ups are, good cover, and secret areas. A good way to this is to play with the infinite health cheat so you can explore without worrying about anything."

Secrets can often be found behind walls, from a switch, or some other trigger. If you\u2019re having trouble finding secrets, you can look for a Computer Area Map in the Level, which shows every part of the level on the automap."

      "headline":"Keep moving.",

Doom is structured so the faster you move, the harder it is for you to be hit and the more enemies you can take on."
