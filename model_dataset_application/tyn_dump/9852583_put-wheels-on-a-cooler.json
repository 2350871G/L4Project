Adjust the positioning of the bracket to center it as much as possible. Arrange the wheel base so that the bracket is lying flat against the ground beneath the wheels.

If the straps you're working with are particularly long, you may need to wrap them around more than once in order to hold the cooler in place. If you really want to make sure your cooler doesn't budge, consider using a pair of straps or cords. Ratchet straps can come in handy for locking down large coolers, as they can be tightened little by little until there's no slack remaining."
