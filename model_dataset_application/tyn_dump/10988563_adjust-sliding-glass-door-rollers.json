If you're not sure whether the door is straight, pull it slightly ajar and check the reveal, or the area where the inner edge meets the door jamb. It may be easier to spot alignment issues that way than by looking at the frame. Remember to replace the plugs that cover the adjustment screw slots if your door has them."

Repeat the process with the rollers on the opposite side of the door. If it's not possible to remove your door's rollers with a screwdriver, you'll need to shift the side panels of the door upward enough to slide the rollers clear of the track. You can do this by tapping them with a rubber mallet. Keep the extracted roller units together the entire time they're out of the doorframe, and be careful not to drop them, or they could break."

Re-wet your cleaning pad with fresh alcohol before turning your attention to the second set of rollers. If you need something a little stronger to cut through stubborn buildup, try using denatured alcohol instead. Denatured alcohol is especially useful for dissolving grease and sticky substances from metal. There's no need to dry the clean rollers manually, as the alcohol will quickly evaporate on its own."

Coat the track with a thin, even layer of lubricant, then clean up any excess lubricant that's found its way onto the surrounding floor with a folded paper towel. You can pick up a can of silicone lubricant at any hardware store or home improvement center for just a few dollars. Another less messy option is to rub the length of the track with a block of paraffin wax.Warning: It's important to only clean your sliding glass door's track with a silicone-based spray or paraffin wax. Ordinary lubricants like WD-40 can actually attract dust and dirt and gum up your tracks faster than normal."
