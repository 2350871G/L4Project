          "headline":"Use autofocus so you can take pictures quickly.",
          "description":"You don't want to have to set the focal point for every picture that you take, so set your camera to continuous autofocus. The camera will automatically focus as you take each picture, leaving you free to capture as many images as possible in a shorter amount of time. If you don't need to take lots of pictures very quickly while photographing the dancers, you don't need to turn on autofocus."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Set the camera to a fast shutter speed.",
          "description":"The dancers will be moving quickly, and you don't want your photos to come out blurry and behind. A shutter speed of at least 1/500 is necessary to capture movement, and 1/1000 is even more ideal. A fast shutter speed will freeze the dancer's action, giving your photo clarity."

          "headline":"Shoot the photos in burst mode to ensure a great shot.",
          "description":"In burst mode, your camera takes a bunch of pictures back to back so that you capture an entire movement. Instead of one picture of a dancer jumping, you'll get a large group of photos of the jump, allowing you to choose which one is best. For example, turn on burst mode when you're shooting dance portraits, or when dancers are performing a lift."

          "description":"During most dance recitals, taking pictures with a flash isn't allowed because it distracts the dancers and can be bothersome to the rest of the audience. If the dance recital does allow flash, great! If you're not sure, check before the recital so that you can alter your camera's settings beforehand. Ask someone in charge of the dance recital, look for postings, or listen in the introduction to see if the speaker asks the audience not to use flash."

          "description":"The lighting at the recital will likely not be great, so it's important to open up your aperture as wide as it will go. A setting of at least f2.8 is good, and if the recital is well-lit you can opt for f3.5 or f4. The aperture is the adjustable hole that the light passes through, and it's measured in F stops."

          "description":"A monopod is a great tool for holding your camera steady as you're photographing, but if you're in the audience and don't have access to a monopod, hold the camera steadily in your hands. Hold your palm up and place the camera on it, using the other hand to press the shutter button. If you're still having trouble holding your camera still, trying taking the photo in between breaths."

          "description":"If you're in the back of the auditorium or recital hall, it's going to be a lot more difficult to capture clear pictures, even if you're using a great camera. Get to the dance recital early to get seats close to the stage near the middle. It's better to take pictures and then crop them later on to zoom in, if necessary."

Try to go to the dress rehearsal\u2014the seats will be practically empty and you can take your photos from any vantage point you'd like. Take some shots beside the stage in the wings, if possible, as well as from the audience."

Try to get a wide range of action photos, from leaps to twirls, jumps to simple stretches, so that you have a variety of different movements. For example, if a dancer asks for a picture of them doing a leap, aim for capturing them when they're in mid-air with both legs extended. Using burst mode will help you capture the perfect action shot."

          "description":"You'll have more space while taking dance portraits than you would at a recital, so set up a tripod to keep your camera from moving around. You can use a monopod as well, but a tripod is the steadiest and will allow you to focus on creating the best images as opposed to worrying about blurriness. You can find a tripod at big box stores, camera stores, or online."

          "headline":"Use natural lighting in the photo shoot.",
          "description":"While you can open up the aperture or use flash if the lighting isn't ideal, taking photos in natural sunlight will make your photos come out focused and dynamic. Set up additional lighting if needed, and use reflectors to bounce the light and help eliminate shadows. Ask the dancer if they wouldn't mind doing their photo shoot outdoors so that you can take advantage of the natural lighting."

This allows the dancer to decide if they need to make any adjustments to their movement so that the photo comes out perfectly. For example, a dancer might look at the photo and realize their arms aren't extended all the way. With this information, they can be sure to extend their arms in the next photo you take."
