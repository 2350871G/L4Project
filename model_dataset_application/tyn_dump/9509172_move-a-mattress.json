You may need to navigate tricky areas like tight corners, small doorways, or stairs while moving the mattress out of the bedroom or apartment.

If your moving van is not tightly packed with other boxes and household items, you\u2019ll need to use some of your ratchet tie-down straps to hold your mattress in place against one of the walls of the van. All moving vans will have handles or bars on their interior walls that you can attach straps to. Mattresses transported on their sides will often sag or crease down the middle."
