Screw on the cap and shake the bottle to clean it out. Rinse out the bottle with clean water until you don\u2019t see any more soap. Old soda bottles work well for making a thermos.

Push the blade carefully into the plastic and pull it slowly around the circumference of the bottle.

Put another layer of foil over the first for added layers of insulation. The aluminum foil will help insulate the inner bottle as well as create a reflective surface so cold drinks don\u2019t warm up from the sun as quickly.
