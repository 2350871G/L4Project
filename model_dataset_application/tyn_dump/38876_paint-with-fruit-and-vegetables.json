Visit your local grocery store or farmer\u2019s market, and examine the produce to see which ones most appeal to you. Starfruit is an ideal option for painting because of its star shape. Chinese cabbage can create rose-like shapes when they\u2019re cut. Broccoli and cauliflower work well for painting because of their florets. Mushrooms come in a variety of shapes that allow for creativity.

Cut apples, pears, and strawberries in half lengthwise. Cut oranges, lemons, limes, and bell peppers in half crosswise, and remove the seeds. You can cut potatoes and carrots into wedges, quarters, or specific shapes, such as a star, heart, or flower. Bananas may be cut lengthwise or crosswise. You can leave raspberries, blueberries, grapes, corn on the cob, and small mushrooms whole."
