  "text":" Cutting the Rafter Pieces Buy 24 2x4 boards for the rafters. If your shed is 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, each full rafter piece will be constructed of 4 2x4 boards that are 4 feet (1.2 m) long. Count the number of wall studs you have. You\u2019ll need a full rafter piece for each wall stud in your barn or shed. If you have 6 wall studs, you\u2019ll need 6 full rafters.

It may be helpful to buy extra boards in case you make a mistake. Mark the end of the boards on a 22.5-degree angle. Line the pivot point on a speed square to the corner of each board at a 22.5-degree angle and mark it with a pencil. Both ends of each board should be marked this way. You'll cut along the lines that you make. Cut the boards with a miter or circular saw. Line the saw blade up against the line that you made. Press the trigger on the saw and lower it to cut off the ends of the boards at an angle. Once you\u2019re done, the board\u2019s ends should sit fit flush against each other. If you have a miter saw, you can set the cutting angle on the saw itself without having to use a speed square. Assembling the Rafters Lay a piece of 10 ft \u00d7 5 ft (3.0 m \u00d7 1.5 m) plywood on the floor. This piece of plywood represents the dimensions for your roof and will serve as an assembly site for your rafters. If you have a 10 ft (3.0 m)-wide shed, your roof will be 10 ft (3.0 m)-wide and 5 ft (1.5 m)-tall. Lay down the piece of plywood in an area with ample space. Assemble the rafters onto the piece of plywood. Place the rafter pieces on the piece of plywood and line them up so that the ends of each piece runs flush with the piece next to it. This is how the rafters will look when they are on top of your shed. Screw wood blocks on both sides of each side of the boards. Position 3 in \u00d7 6 in (76 mm \u00d7 152 mm) wood blocks on both sides of each rafter piece. The wood blocks will help keep the rafter pieces in place as you connect them. Use an electric screwdriver to drive screws into each end of the wood blocks and directly into the plywood below. You can use the wood from any excess wood that you cut so far.

Get help from 2-3 friends to help during this stage. Put ladders on both sides of the barn or shed and have one person inside of the shed. Hoist the rafters on top of the shed and line it up so that it runs flush with the wall stud. Screw the rafter into the wall. Position a metal joint plate between the rafter and top of the wall.
