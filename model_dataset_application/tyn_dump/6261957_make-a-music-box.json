  "text":" Installing the Musical Mechanism Purchase a music box mechanism kit. There are many types of music box mechanisms available, from ones that operate with gears to those that feature a series of bells or paper scroll mechanisms.

Make sure that you check the dimensions of the music box mechanism before you purchase it to ensure that it will fit into the box you have chosen.
