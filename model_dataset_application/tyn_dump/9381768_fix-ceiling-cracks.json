This way, once you\u2019re done fixing the crack, you can just throw away the sheet of plastic and not have to worry about cleaning your floors. You can also remove cloth or fabric-covered furniture from the room since it will be difficult to clean paint and dust off of it."

Make sure that all four legs are stable and flat on the floor before you climb up, and avoid making sudden movements while you\u2019re on the ladder. If your ladder has a fold-out section across from the top rung, you can use this to hold your tape, mud, and other repair supplies. A-frame ladders should be available for purchase at a local hardware store or home-supply store. A 6- or 8-foot (1.8-2.4 m) ladder will be most useful. If you have a low ceiling, you could feasibly use a step-ladder to fix the crack. The disadvantage, though, would be that you\u2019ll be more precariously balanced on top of the step-ladder, and won\u2019t have a way to set your patching materials within reach."

Slide it up under any loose, unattached pieces of drywall paper that are torn near the crack. Use the knife to slice these off, being careful not to damage the drywall beneath.

Position the tape so it\u2019s centered directly over the crack, and press it firmly onto the ceiling. Do not apply more than a single layer of tape. Go over the tape a few times with a rolling pin or can to smooth it out. Mesh drywall tape will be available for purchase at a local hardware store or home-supply store.

While holding the container over your kitchen sink, use your putty knife to thoroughly mix the 5-minute mud. Continue adding water and mixing until the mud is roughly the consistency of mayonnaise. You can also secure the ceiling crack with joint compound. However, 5-minute mud will set more firmly than joint compound, and bolster the structural integrity of ceiling drywall. Five-minute mud will be available for purchase at your local hardware or home-supply store. You should only need a 3-lb (1.4 kg) bag of the sand. This should sell for between $5 USD and $7 USD. You can also use mud with a longer drying time, like 20-minute mud. Using mud with a longer drying time will give you more time to do the repair. As long as you do not mix the mud too watery, it will not fall on you, but you will need more time at the beginning to get the hang of plastering a ceiling. Spray the ceiling with a spray water bottle to help the mud adhere to the existing plaster. Mud does not stick to dust, oil, mold, too flat or loose surfaces."

If you can, apply the mud in a single direction, parallel with the crack. Work quickly, since the mud will be dry in 5 minutes. Once you\u2019ve applied the first layer, wait 30 minutes for the mud to fully dry. If the layer of mud looks uneven, use a wet sponge to smooth it out before it dries."

If your ceiling has a swirl texture, use a soft paintbrush to recreate the pattern in the mud. If your ceiling has a knock-down texture, press a firm, wet piece of paper into the mud to replicate the texture. If your ceiling has a popcorn texture, spray over the mud with a popcorn ceiling patch spray."
