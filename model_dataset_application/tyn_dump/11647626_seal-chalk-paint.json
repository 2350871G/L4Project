As a general rule, use 500 ml (16 oz) for every 3-4 liters (0.8-1 gal) of paint. Get the correct amount for the piece you\u2019ve painted. Wax often comes in 1 pound (0.45 kg) containers, so 1 can should be enough for smaller pieces. If you\u2019re sealing multiple pieces or a furniture set, get multiple cans. Wax isn\u2019t a glossy finish, so your piece won\u2019t shine as much as if you use a different sealer. If you do want a glossy shine, use polyurethane or a similar wax alternative."
