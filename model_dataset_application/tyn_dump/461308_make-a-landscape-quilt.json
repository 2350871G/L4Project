  "text":" Starting Tips Select a photo or work from a pencil sketch.  Collect an assortment of fabric. Scraps can work fine, but you may need to purchase specific colors for specific areas of your landscape. Be bold. This quilt is for your own enjoyment. Plan your work. List out all the aspects of your landscape that need doing... and then prioritize them or order them for later reference. Visualize your finished piece. What embellishments will you add? What sort of border will there be? Expect to adjust your plan as you go along.  Use a light weight fabric for a base. Use straight pins and test out your arrangement before you sew them together. Some should go completely across,while others colors can be added in. Usually the background (sky)will be dominate, or it can be flipped and the foreground (ground) will be dominate. These will be sewn all horizontally. Other items can be appliqu\u00e9d on later. Applique Method Start by creating your background/base material.  Cut the strips you like from your fabric scraps.  Position each strip and check the pinned pieces on the foundation cloth. See if you like the way they look before you attach them. Only sew about three strips together at one time and iron each group before moving on to the next. Repeat. Attach other shapes (a tree, flower, cloud ) to the piece. Either use an iron on fusible webbing and satin stitch on your sewing machine or by hand basting and then rolling the edges under as you sew them down (can be done by hand or by machine). Puff Method Try a fabric that has a preprinted scene on it. if you're a beginner. Layer your quilt pieces, the printed (front side), the quilt batting, and the backing as you would for regular quilting.  Machine or hand sew around the perimeter all of the areas of the picture that you would like to emphasize. You can even use this method to FLATTEN areas. If you want extra \"puffiness\" in an area, cut a small slit in the backing material under that area and tuck in more batting before sewing it closed.  Add binding on each side. To do this, take a 2 and 1/2\" piece of fabric folded and ironed. Attach the open side down with your sewing machine and \"flip\" it over to the back for a finished look. Add the finishing touches. Make a \"sleeve\" to insert a stick across the top and make a loop to hang on the wall. Sign and date your quilts so you will always know who made it and when it was made.",
