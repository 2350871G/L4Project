Remove the canning jars with canning tongs and place them on a counter pre-lined with a clean towel. Do this so that the heat difference between the counter and the jars doesn't cause them to crack. Dunk the lids and tops into the near-boiling water and leave them there for 5 minutes before removing and placing on a clean towel."
