You can lower the scroll speed for easier songs, or raise it up to 4x in increments of 1 (or up to 6.5x on Full Mode, in increments of 0.5). The command to raise the scroll speed is \u2196\u2197\u2196\u2197??, and to lower the scroll speed is \u2197\u2196\u2197\u2196??. Make sure to know the song's BPM (tempo). Scroll speed will depend on it; for example, a BPM200 song at 1x scroll speed and a BPM100 song at 2x scroll speed will have arrows moving at the same speed. Some songs change scroll speed in the middle. They are typically marked with two BPMs if the song actually changes tempo, but if the chart has gimmicks where it speeds up, slows down, or stutters, it may not be shown in the BPM display in the song selection."

If you are completely new to the music game genre, try a song that has a chart with a difficulty of 1 or 2, and lower the scroll speed to 1x. If you have played music games in the past, or play a musical instrument, you might want to start out at around 4 or 5. If a difficulty says \u201cDouble\u201d and has a green background, it means one player plays on all 10 panels. Unless you know what you're doing, make sure to avoid these."

Don't be shy to move around and twist your body. Instead of stepping and returning, walk around on the platform.
