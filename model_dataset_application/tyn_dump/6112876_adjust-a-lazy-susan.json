          "description":"When a Lazy Susan becomes stiff and difficult to rotate, the problem is usually caused by either the center shaft or the position of its bottom shelf. Lightly spin the Susan and note where it locks up, has difficulty turning, or has poor clearance. If the center movable shelf begins to bind, it will prevent free rotation. In this situation, you\u2019ll need to loosen this shelf. If the circular shelves slip down the center shaft, the bottom shelf can begin to drag, making it difficult to turn. You will need to adjust the height of this shelf to fix the problem."

          "description":"Look at the top of the center shaft. There should be one large bolt locking the exterior shaft to a metal sleeve positioned inside the shaft. This is the locking bolt for the shaft. This bolt holds the center shaft in place and maintains the length of the shaft. Sometimes excess pressure from this bolt can cause the shaft to bind. On some models, the locking bolt might be located at the bottom of the Susan, however, in most cases, it will found near the top."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Loosen the bolt.",
          "description":"If anything is inside your Lazy Susan, empty it so you have more space to work. Using a wrench or ratchet, loosen the bolt by turning it one-quarter of a full rotation counterclockwise. At first, the bolt may require some elbow grease to break loose. Only loosen the bolt enough to manipulate the hardware inside the center shaft. On some models, this might require more or less than one-quarter rotation. Generally, it\u2019s better to loosen the bolt in small increments. This will prevent you from loosening it too much, which could result in the alignment of the Susan being thrown off."

          "headline":"Move the adjusting rod.",
          "description":"Now that the bolt is loose, you\u2019ll be able to adjust the center shaft. Slide the metal adjusting sleeve the bolt was holding in place no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) to provide better clearance between the center shaft and top of the cabinet. Work in small increments when adjusting the center shaft. Large adjustments could cause the Lazy Susan to topple over."

          "headline":"Locate the locking screws to adjust the shelf position.",
          "description":"Most Lazy Susans should have two or more locking screws located at the center of each shelf. These screws hold the shelves to the center shaft. When all of the shelves are held together by the front decorative panel, you will need to adjust the entire shelf system. In this case, there may not be screws located at the height of each shelf. If the shelves must be adjusted separately, you'll only need to work with the bottom shelf. Locate the locking screws in the bottom shelf only."

Apply firm pressure down on the screw while turning counterclockwise to prevent stripping fastener hardware. Screws can be left in their holes once they have been unattached from the center shaft. However, you may want to set loosened screws off to the side to prevent any from getting lost."

The shelves may resist this adjustment and begin binding on the center shaft. Maneuver shelves until they are level and at a suitable height. Under no circumstances should you lubricate the center shaft. Doing so could prevent the screws from holding their position."

Take care not to let the shelf slip as you reattach fasteners, as this could cause it to become uneven or binding. Make the screws as tight as possible without stripping any of the hardware. The shelves must be stationary and secure to prevent this kind of misalignment."

    "Gradually rotate the door in a clockwise direction until it reaches the exact center-front.",
    "If possible, take a step back and check the alignment from a distance.",
    "Make sure the door is precisely in place before moving on.",
    "The plastic collar should remain fixed in place as you rotate the door, so it may be difficult to step away.",
    "Have a friend or family member help you evaluate the door position, in these cases.",
    "If you accidentally rotate past the center-front position, continue rotating the door in a clockwise direction.",
    "Do not rotate it counterclockwise until after you finish setting it.",
    "Turn the entire assembly.",
    "Carefully and slowly rotate the entire assembly in a counterclockwise direction.",
    "Continue turning the assembly until the collar screw faces you.",
    "The door and collar should maintain their alignment as you turn the assembly.",
    "It may help you to maintain the position of the collar and door by marking their correct positions with a piece of painter\u2019s tape, masking tape, or something similar.",
    "Tighten the screw to finish adjusting uneven doors.",
    "Tighten the collar screw back into its original position.",
    "The door should now be properly aligned and fixed into place.",
    "Give the Lazy Susan a few spins to check that everything works correctly, and your door adjustment is finished.",
    "To prevent the collar from twisting out of place while it\u2019s fastened, you may need to hold it in place as the screw is tightened.",
    "Correcting Insufficient Top, Bottom, and Side Clearance Remove the retainer clip to improve top and bottom clearance.",
    "Locate the plastic retainer clip at the bottom of the center shaft.",
    "Firmly grasp the clip between your fingers, open it, and pull it out.",
    "Under the clip should be a cut-out portion of the shaft with a thumbscrew adjustment wheel.",
    "The cabinet will need to be completely empty when you make this adjustment.",
    "Do not attempt to complete the process when the shelves are loaded, especially if they are heavily loaded.",
    "Turn the adjustment wheel.",
    "Use your fingers to turn the thumbscrew adjustment wheel in the cut-out portion of the center shaft.",
    "Rotate the wheel clockwise to raise the door and counterclockwise to lower the door.",
    "Generally you can expect that for each full rotation of the screw the height will be adjusted by about 1/32 in (0.8 mm).",
    "You may need to apply gentle pressure to the underside of the bottom shelf to aid the adjustment if you are attempting to raise the door.",
    "Replace the retainer clip to complete the top and bottom adjustment.",
    "After adjusting the door to the proper height, return the retainer clip to its original position at the bottom of the pole.",
    "The clip should fasten back into place firmly.",
    "It's a good idea to tighten all of the adjustment screws attached to the center shaft, shelves, and door after setting the height.",
    "Doing this could prevent the door from falling out of alignment again.",
    "Outline the top and bottom brackets when side clearance is insufficient.",
    "Using an erasable pencil, lightly outline the current position of the top and bottom brackets.",
    "If lighting is too poor inside the cabinet to make these marks easily, use a flashlight or electric lantern.",
    "Doing this will give you a reference point to work from as you make the adjustment.",
    "Pencil marks can be erased once you complete the process.",
    "Realign the pivot pole from the top.",
    "Use a screwdriver to remove the setscrews and loosen the star washers holding the pivot housing in place on both sides of the pivot pole.",
    "Adjust the pivot housing and pivot pole until both are centered and aligned.",
    "When the star washers are in place but before fastening the setscrews, take a step back and look over your Lazy Susan.",
    "If the side clearance is still uneven, remove the washers and readjust the pivot.",
    "Use your outline to guide your adjustments.",
    "For example, if the left side is low, you\u2019ll likely need to move the pivot pole and housing to the right.",
    "Refasten the pivot housing.",
    "Once you tighten the star washers, you\u2019ll be ready to return the setscrews to their original position.",
    "When the screws are in place, check the side clearance of the Lazy Susan again to make sure that it wasn't altered as you refastened its hardware.",
    "This adjustment may take care of your side clearance problem.",
    "If the lower half of your Susan appears to be misaligned, you\u2019ll have to adjust the pivot base in addition to its top.",
    "Realign the pivot base when necessary.",
    "Open the door wide enough to expose the bottom bracket on either side of the Susan.",
    "Loosen this bracket by removing the fastening setscrew and star washer with a screwdriver.",
    "Now you can realign the pivot cam (metal arm) base so that it\u2019s centered.",
    "You\u2019ll have to repeat this process on the opposite side of the Lazy Susan where you\u2019ll find an identical bracket/pivot cam base.",
    "Work on brackets one at a time.",
    "After you\u2019ve taken apart, realigned, and refastened the first bracket, move on to the next one.",
    "When properly centered, the pivot cam bases of both sides should be aligned with regard to the center pole.",
    "Refasten the bracket.",
    "Be careful when refastening; if you jostle the pivot cam, it could be knocked out of alignment.",
    "Replace the star washers and reattach the setscrews for the bracket.",
    "When fastened, similarly adjust the opposite side bottom bracket/pivot cam base.",
    "Verify that the position did not become altered while you were returning these pieces to their original positions by stepping back and evaluating the evenness of the side clearance.",
    "Check the door to complete your side clearance adjustment.",
    "Sometimes these alignments (especially those made to pivots) can require several attempts before they are resolved.",
    "Double check door alignment after completing the top and bottom adjustments, especially.",
    "If the side clearance is still unequal, you will need to readjust the top pivot pole and/or bottom pivot cams."
