No matter what color you choose, go for an indoor, latex, heat-resistant stone paint to make sure that your new color will last. Try a crisp white coat for a modern look. If you have white walls, offset the colors with a rustic wooden mantelpiece or give your room a youthful feel with a bright mint or cream mantel. Go for a black fireplace to create a striking contrast in a white room. For a less extreme contrast, dark gray can look sleek in a light-colored room. Your paint should be able to withstand about 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C) heat."

    "If your tile was originally a dark color, you may need 3-4 coats of paint.",
    "Let it dry, then remove coverings and painter\u2019s tape.",
    "Give your tile a day or so to dry completely after your last coat of paint.",
    "When it\u2019s done, pull away the coverings and and painter\u2019s tape and enjoy your freshly-painted fireplace!",
    "\u201cWhitewashing\u201d a Stone Fireplace Buy an all-in-one primer to \u201cwhitewash\u201d your walls.",
    "If you want to update a dark stone fireplace with a new color but keep the textured, unique look of the stone, you can \u201cwhitewash\u201d it with  primer.",
    "This will turn the stone different shades of white, creating an interesting, modern look similar to granite or limestone.",
    "Look for an all-in-one primer that\u2019s also a sealant and stain-protector.",
    "Stone fireplaces tend to be dark and heavy-looking, so a white finish can brighten up and expand your whole room.",
    "Painting your stone in a solid color will make it look chunky and cheap, so it\u2019s best to redo it in a light color like white or cream.",
    "Clean your stones with a TSP mix before painting.",
    "To get rid of any dirt or soot on your stones, mix \u20442\u20131 cup (120\u2013240 mL) of a trisodium phosphate (TSP) cleaning agent with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water.",
    "Saturate a scrub brush and rub it on the stones to clean them.",
    "Wipe it clean with a wet sponge afterwards and let it dry.",
    "Wear gloves and safety goggles when you\u2019re using TSP.",
    "Cover your floor and fireplace opening with plastic sheets.",
    "Lay plastic sheets or old towels on the floor around your fireplace to protect from spills, and hang a sheet down over the fireplace opening.",
    "Use painters tape around the edges of your stone so you don\u2019t paint over the edges of the stone on accident.",
    "Mix a bit of water and primer in your paint tray.",
    "Fill your paint tray with about 1\u20131.5 inches (2.5\u20133.8 cm) of water.",
    "Mix your primer with a stir stick and dip a medium-sized paintbrush inside.",
    "Pull it out and mix the primer with the water, then repeat.",
    "Diluting the primer like this will allow the natural texture of the stone to show through.",
    "All-in-one primers stain easily and are hard to wash off of skin, so wear rubber gloves to keep your hands clean.",
    "Paint a few stones from different areas of the fireplace.",
    "Choose one stone to start with and paint on your primer, making sure to get into the crevices for an even coat.",
    "Then, choose a stone from a different area of the fireplace and do the same thing.",
    "You can do 5-7 stones with this mix of primer and water.",
    "To create a nice contrast, avoid painting the grout between the stones.",
    "This will help the stones stand out against the wall.",
    "Create a more solid mix of primer in your paint tray.",
    "Once your paint tray is empty, pour in another 1\u20131.5 inches (2.5\u20133.8 cm) of water.",
    "Mix in 3-4 brushfuls of paint this time to create a more solid dilution.",
    "Apply it to random stones around your fireplace like before\nContinue creating slightly different dilutions for each round of painting, until all of your stones are whitewashed.",
    "Mixing up the amount of dilution will give you a natural-looking diversity in hues.",
    "Your fireplace will keep its earthy stone quality while getting a clean, whitewashed upgrade.",
    "Brush over with a last layer of paint for natural highlights.",
    "Once you\u2019re done painting, mix at least 4 brushfuls of paint into 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in your paint tray.",
    "Brush this mixture lightly and quickly over the top of each stone.",
    "This last, quick application creates highlights that look like calcium or mineral veins coming through the stone.",
    "Painting the Interior of the Fireplace Clean out your firebox before painting.",
    "Remove the grate on your fireplace and use a fireplace shovel and broom to remove ash.",
    "If there\u2019s any ash on the walls, scrape it off.",
    "Then, vacuum the box and use damp rags to wipe it down.",
    "Although repainting the interior, or firebox, of your fireplace won\u2019t make as big of an impact on your room as painting the outside, it can still give your fireplace an overall cleaner look.",
    "Use high-heat black paint for a long-lasting paint job.",
    "You\u2019ll need high heat paint that can withstand temperatures up to 1,200 \u00b0F (649 \u00b0C) in your fireplace, and black is a great color to choose because soot and ash will blend right into it.",
    "You can buy high-heat paint at home improvement stores or online.",
    "Look for one with a flat finish as well.",
    "Lay plastic around your fireplace to protect from spills.",
    "You don\u2019t want your black paint to drip on your floor or the outside of your fireplace, so use plastic tarps or old towels as a covering.",
    "Stick painter\u2019s tape around the outer edges of the firebox to prevent your paintbrush from accidentally straying.",
    "Paint the interior walls of your fireplace first.",
    "Mix up your can of pain with a stir stick and dip in a medium-sized paintbrush.",
    "Start by painting the walls of your fireplace so that if paint drips down, you can simply blend it in when you paint the bottom.",
    "Work the paint into the grout, cracks, and crevices between bricks to get full, even coverage.",
    "You can use a cheap, nylon bristle brush and simply throw it away when you\u2019re done, since it will get stained black by the paint.",
    "If parts of your fireplace are already black from fires, you can decrease your workload by skipping over those parts with your paint.",
    "Paint 2 coats, waiting 1-2 hours in between to let them set.",
    "Giving the interior of your fireplace 2 coats of paint will ensure full coverage and a rich, dark color that will offset your fires nicely.",
    "Check the instructions on the can to see how long the paint will take to dry between each application.",
    "Paint the bottom of the fireplace and let it dry before use.",
    "Once the walls are done, you can move onto the floor of the fireplace.",
    "Give it 2 coats of paint, making sure to cover up any drips from the walls.",
    "Let it dry completely.",
    "Wait to make a fire until another 24 hours or so after the paint dries, to make sure it\u2019s completely done."
