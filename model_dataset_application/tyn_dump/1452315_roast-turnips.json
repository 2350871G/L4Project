They can be roasted whole or cut into chunks if preferred. Roll the peeled turnips or chunks of turnips in olive oil. Add them to the roasting/baking dish and place in the oven. Bake in a moderate oven until tender. They should be turned once or twice during the roasting. Small turnips roast in about 25 minutes, while larger chunks can take another 5 minutes."

These chunks should be added about an hour before the estimated finish time for the roast. Turnip chunks can also be mixed in with other vegetables being roasted, such as potatoes, carrots, swedes, etc."
