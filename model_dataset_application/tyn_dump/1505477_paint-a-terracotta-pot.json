If your pot is already clean and smooth after its bath, feel free to skip this step! Surface impurities on your pot will show through the paint, so make sure it\u2019s as clean and smooth as you can possibly get it. The color of the terracotta will help you tell if it is dry. The pot will be significantly darker when wet, and lighten up as it dries."

          "description":"Terracotta is a porous surface, so priming the pot is an important step. The primer will prevent the paint from bubbling or looking speckled, and it will give your pot an overall smooth and polished appearance. There are various kinds of primers with different instructions, so follow the instructions on the packaging. Cover all areas of the pot that you are going to be painting. Spray the areas you aren't going to be painting (such as the inside of the pot and the bottom) with the waterproof sealant. Make sure the primer and sealant are completely dry before you begin painting. Most primers are a plain white color, but feel free to tint them with your background paint color if you prefer. Tinting them with a darker color may be useful if you want your finished pot to be dark."

You can then paint the color and peel off the tape, leaving a perfectly clean line. Allow your background to dry, preferably overnight. You may need to apply several coats of paint, particularly if you are using light colors. After your first coat of paint is completely dry, you can decide if you need one or two more. Always a coat to dry completely before adding another. By letting them dry in the sun, it\u2019ll speed up the process and you\u2019ll air out the paint smell!"

Make sure you are somewhere with good ventilation, and spray the pot thoroughly with an acrylic sealer. It goes on clear, so it won\u2019t mess up your painting. Spray until you think you\u2019ve covered the entire surface of the pot, and then spray it again. You want to make sure you don\u2019t miss an inch- even areas that you did not paint. The unpainted areas are still vulnerable to moisture, and if damage to unpainted areas can affect your beautiful painted areas! The sealant dries pretty quickly, but you should let your pot sit for a couple of days before you expose it to any moisture. This will ensure that everything is completely sealed and protected."
