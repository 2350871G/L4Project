Use stakes to help the trunk of your young tree grow straight and tall, and encourage a more balanced root system. If you live in a relatively cooler climate, you may want to plant the tree in a more sheltered spot, such as next to a wall, to protect it from strong winds and frost. Just make sure it will still get full sun."

Always prune on a relatively dry day to reduce the chance of spreading disease or infection. After the first year, avoid pruning more than a third of the tree's branches unless the tree is diseased or significantly damaged. You may want to prune a bit more aggressively in the tree's first year to establish the shape in which you want the tree to grow, but try not to take more than 50 percent of the new growth. In the summer, prune away any dead or damaged leaves. You may also want to remove foliage that shields the fruits from the sun.

These branches should be relatively evenly spaced out. Cut out any branches that cross or compete with your shape. As you're pruning, step back often and look at the big picture.
