Leaving it out at room temperature will give the dough plenty of time to properly rise. Once the dough has risen enough, place it in the oven and bake it as per the recipe. Defrosting with an Oven Squirt cooking spray on a bowl or baking pan. Make sure that your cooking pan or bowl is large enough to support the dough once it rises to twice its frozen size. Use cooking spray you bought in a store or fill a spray bottle with your favorite type of oil. Place the dough in the pan and cover it with plastic wrap. Coat the plastic wrap first with your cooking spray to make sure the dough doesn't stick to it when it rises. Wrap the plastic tightly around the dough to ensure it's properly heated when it's put it in the oven. Put the pan in the oven at 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). If you have a gas oven, put the heating on the lowest gas mark. Some ovens have a \"bread proofing\" setting, which will set the temperature to 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). This temperature is the perfect heat for defrosting frozen dough. Take the pan out of the oven after 1 hour to test it. When the time is up, put on oven gloves and remove the pan from the oven.

If the dough hasn't risen to twice its size, it may need more time. Rewrap the dough in plastic wrap before putting it back in the oven. If the dough has risen a small amount, you should put it back in for 30 minutes. If it hasn't risen at all, put it back in for another hour. Remove the plastic wrap before baking the dough as the recipe indicates. When the time is up, remove the plastic wrap and place the dough on your work surface. Then, put it on a clean pan and bake it following the instructions in your specific recipe.",
