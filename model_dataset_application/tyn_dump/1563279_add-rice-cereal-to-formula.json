This is the time for you to ask questions and mention any concerns you have about solid foods.

          "description":"Your infant's digestive system is not ready to process cereal until about 6 months of age. Giving your infant cereal too early increases the chance of choking or inhaling the rice cereal mixture into his or her lungs. Early exposure to cereal can also increase your baby's risk of developing food allergies. Your baby may be ready to try rice cereal at 4 months of age. Your doctor can help you decide what is best for your baby. It may be alright to introduce rice cereal before 4 to 6 months of age if your baby has reflux issues. Talk to your pediatrician before you try this though. Your baby should also be able to eat from a spoon before you introduce rice cereal to his or her diet. Feeding your baby solid foods too early can cause your baby to become overweight."

          "headline":"Be sure your infant has met the necessary developmental milestones.",
          "description":"In addition to being old enough, your infant should meet certain developmental milestones before you introduce cereal. Your infant should be able to sit with support, have head and neck control, push up with elbows from a lying position, place hands or toys in his or her mouth, and lean forward and open his or mouth when hungry or interested in food. If your child is 6 months of age, but has not met these milestones, you may need to delay the introduction of rice cereal. Waiting for these milestones is important. They help ensure that your infant can safely swallow the rice cereal. Infants also have an extrusion reflex that causes them to raise their tongue and push against objects that are placed between their lips. This reflex is usually gone by 4 to 6 months of age. Trying to spoon feed your child cereal with this reflex can be frustrating and difficult."

Eating cereal from a bottle can make it more difficult for your baby to learn to eat from a spoon and can increase the risk of your baby eating too much and becoming overweight. To reduce reflux, keep your infant upright (i.e. on your shoulder) for 20 to 30 minutes after a feeding. Try a premixed,\"anti-reflux\" formula. These formulas contain rice starch. Try a hypoallergenic formula that does not contain cow milk or soy milk and see if your infant's reflux improves. Try this for one or two weeks. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend that you feed your baby rice cereal from a bottle.

Cut a larger hole in the nipple of the bottle because the mixture is thicker than formula alone. Don't give your baby rice cereal at every feeding. Rice cereal is mostly carbohydrates and does not provide the same nutrition that formula or breast milk does. Giving your baby rice cereal at every feeding may decrease the amount of nutrients the baby is getting.

Adjust the amount of rice cereal you are giving your baby based on your observations. If the rice cereal makes your baby constipated, you may want to try oatmeal instead. If you are trying to treat your baby's reflux, you should start seeing results in 2 or 3 days.

Give your infant one teaspoon (5 ml) of the mixture at the end of breastfeeding or bottle feeding at first. Gradually build up to one to four tablespoons (15 to 60 ml) of the mixture two times a day. This process will give your infant time to develop his or her ability to swallow. Place the spoon near your baby's lips and let your baby smell and taste the cereal on the spoon first. Your baby will probably refuse to eat at first. If your infant is not interested in the mixture or refuses to eat it, try the mixture again the next day. You can also try a thinner mixture. Your infant may intermittently spit out some cereal with his or her tongue as a natural reflex. You can also feed your infant formula or breast milk from the bottle, serve the rice mixture from the spoon, and then end the feeding with formula or breast milk from the bottle. You can begin to thicken the mixture once your baby has tolerated the mixture well for three to five days. Your baby may vomit after trying the rice cereal the first few times.
