          "description":"Cacao pods can often be obtained from a farmer\u2019s market or fellow gardener in tropical climates. Otherwise, you\u2019ll likely need to buy your starter pod through an online retailer. Be prepared to pay for expedited shipping, as cacao seeds will only germinate when they\u2019re fresh. Familiarize yourself with your country\u2019s import laws if you're ordering a pod from overseas. Most reputable sellers will typically inform you of potential issues before you buy. Each pod holds up to 30-50 seeds, giving you plenty of chances to get a new plant growing successfully. If you'd prefer the ease of growing a chocolate tree from a viable seedling, you can order a young plant from an exotic plant nursery or special horticulturist and skip straight to the planting process once it arrives."

A knowledgeable cacao farmer or vendor will be able to tell you which plants bear the most fruit in a given set of conditions. Find out the average amount of time it takes for a mature plant to begin producing its own pods. Depending on the variety, it can take anywhere from 2 to 5 years to reach fruiting size."

Ask your local plant nursery or garden center if they can source a cacao seedling for you. Once you receive the tree, all you\u2019ll have to do is plant it and care for it until it begins fruiting. Ask for a \"self-compatible\" cacao plant. These don\u2019t require pollination in order to produce fruit pods (which contain the seeds for making chocolate). Most seeds are \u201cself-incompatible\u201d and need to be pollinated from an unrelated tree. This will require you to have more than 1 tree within the same area. Starting with a seedling is often the promising approach, unless you\u2019re an experienced gardener. A seedling will already be toughened for container growing, and is less likely to succumb to disease of climate-related complications."

If you\u2019re raising the cacao from seed, a small standard pot will work just fine, as long as it\u2019s deep enough for the roots to burrow down. If possible, have one or more larger containers on standby. Developing seedlings will need to be transplanted after about 4-5 months. Fully-grown trees can reach up to 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8 m) in height, with a trunk diameter of 1.5\u20132 feet (0.46\u20130.61 m)."

Then, fill in the loose soil and pat it lightly to hold the seeds or seedling in place.

Young cacao trees will grow on a windowsill, but they will outgrow it. Keep them in dappled shade.

When watering young seedlings, mist the underside of the leaves rather than the top. Pooling water can be too heavy for the leaves to withstand.

The best time to apply fertilizer is during the plant\u2019s peak growing season, which lasts from mid-spring to early fall.
