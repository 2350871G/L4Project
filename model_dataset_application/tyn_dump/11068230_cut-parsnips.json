Hold the narrow end of the parsnip in your non-dominant hand and a sharp handheld vegetable peeler in your dominant hand. To catch the peelings, hold the parsnip over a bowl, sink, or a disposable bag. This makes it easier to discard the peelings once you\u2019re done."

Carefully slide the peeler blade down the parsnip, moving the tool away from your body, until you peel off a piece of skin. Small baby parsnips with tender skin don\u2019t need to be peeled.

Peel away all of the skin that you can while holding the narrow end of the parsnip. Then flip it over so you\u2019re holding the thicker end. Run the peeler below the skin at the slender end, turning it in your hand as you go, until the whole vegetable is free of skin. Refrain from carving away too much of the inside of the parsnip since a lot of flavor and nutrients live right below the skin."

    "This technique makes tougher vegetables a little softer and easier to chew once they\u2019re cooked.",
    "Make cuts at a 45-degree angle along the length of the parsnip for disks.",
    "Press the knife into the parsnip to make each cut.",
    "Space each cut so that you reach the desired thickness for each slice.",
    "Continue cutting the parsnip at this angle until you reach the end, near where your hand is holding it for stability.",
    "For thicker disks, place your cuts \u20444 to \u20442 in (1.9 to 1.3 cm) apart.",
    "Create thinner disks by making cuts \u20444 in (0.64 cm) apart.",
    "One main benefit of cutting disks on the bias is that you end up with more surface area.",
    "This way, the parsnips require less time to cook and will look attractive if you roast them until the edges start to  brown.",
    "Coring Parsnips Cut the parsnip into quarters lengthwise.",
    "Peel, trim, and rinse off your parsnips.",
    "Then place 1 parsnip on your cutting board.",
    "Use a sharp vegetable knife to slice it in half lengthwise.",
    "Then place each of the halves flat-side down on the cutting board.",
    "Cut them in half lengthwise again.",
    "Each quarter should be roughly triangular in shape, with the central core exposed.",
    "Try to make your cuts down the exact center of the parsnip to evenly expose the core.",
    "Stabilize a parsnip quarter on the cutting board, core-side up.",
    "Take 1 of the quarter pieces and place it on the cutting board so that it lays perpendicular to your body.",
    "Hold the thick end in your nondominant hand to stabilize it.",
    "When holding the parsnip piece, place your fingers on either side of the narrow strip, below the core.",
    "Run a sharp paring knife beneath the parsnip\u2019s core.",
    "Hold the knife in your dominant hand, arranging the blade parallel to the cutting board and the parsnip.",
    "Insert the blade at the base of the parsnip\u2019s core and slide it down the length of the parsnip to separate the core.",
    "Move the blade away from your hand as you do this, and feel free to pause and reposition your grip on the parsnip to better stabilize it as you go.",
    "The core has a tougher texture and will usually be slightly lighter or grayer in color.",
    "It will also typically feature a darker outline separating it from the rest of the parsnip.",
    "Don\u2019t pull the knife towards your hand.",
    "Always move the blade away from your hand to avoid any accidents.",
    "Discard the core for a more tender cooked parsnip.",
    "After removing the core from the first quarter of the parsnip, move onto the rest of the quarters.",
    "Cut out the core from each piece, coring 1 at a time, until you\u2019ve separated the entire core from the rest of the parsnip.",
    "Some parsnips are curved so you won\u2019t be able to get out every single part of the core.",
    "That\u2019s ok though \u2013 with the majority of the core removed, your parsnips will still be nice and tender once cooked.",
    "Chop the cored parsnip into similarly-sized chunks.",
    "With the core removed, make crosswise cuts into each of the parsnip quarters to your desired size.",
    "Try to make each chunk or cube roughly the same size so they cook evenly."
