  "text":" Creating the Magic Ring Get out your yarn and crochet hook. You'll need a US size N/P 10mm crochet hook and 1 6-ounce (170 g) skein of yarn in the color of your choice. The yarn should be 106 yards (97 m) long. You'll also need a large-eye tapestry needle for weaving in the yarn tails. The yarn should be soft and super bulky weight. You can use 1 color or switch colors for a multicolored hat. Wrap the yarn twice around your fingers to start a magic ring. Leave a tail about 6 in (15 cm) long. Use your thumb to hold the tail in place so you don't accidentally work it. The working yarn should be to the right of the loop you made. Slide the hook under the loops and pull it from left to right. Insert the crochet hook under both of the loops from right to left. Hook the left loop and pull it under the right loop to make a ring. Hold the ring in place and slide it off of your fingers. Keep the ring large and chain 2 stitches into it. Continue to hold the yarn tail down through the ring so you don't accidentally work it. Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull it through to make 1 chain stitch. Yarn over and make 1 more chain stitch. Double crochet (dc) 8 stitches inside the magic ring. Yarn over, insert your hook into the ring and pull up a loop. Yarn over again, pull through 2, yarn over, and pull through 2 to make 1 double crochet stitch. Make 7 more dc stitches in the magic ring. Pull on the tail to tighten the magic ring. Set the worked piece down and hold it in place with 1 hand. Use your other hand to tug on the tail until the magic ring tightens and brings both ends of the work together. Your worked piece should now look like a compact circle. This will form the top of your slouchy hat. Insert your hook into the first stitch and slip stitch to join it. Once your hook is in the first stitch you made, pull up a loop and pull it through. This will secure your first round. Crocheting the Top of the Hat Make 2 chain stitches and double crochet 2 in each stitch of round 2. Wrap the yarn over your hook and pull it through. Do this again to chain up 2 stitches. Then make 2 double crochet stitches into each stitch in the round. You should have 16 stitches for round 2 once you've finished double crocheting around. Slip stitch to join and make 2 chain stitches. When you reach the end of the round, insert the hook into the first stitch that you made. Wrap the yarn over and pull up a loop. Pull the hook through to slip stitch and secure the round. Then make 2 chain stitches so you can begin the next round. Alternate 2 dc and 1 dc for round 3. Make 2 dc stitches into the first stitch of round 3 and then make 1 dc into the following stitch. Make 2 dc stitches into the next stitch and then 1 dc into the following stitch. Continue to alternate the stitches across the round. You should end up with 24 stitches once you've finished round 3. Slip stitch to join the rounds and chain up 2. To begin round 4, join the round and make 2 chain stitches. At this point, the hat should still look like a flat circle. Alternate 2 dc into 1 stitch with 1 dc into the next 2 stitches. For round 4, increase the row by making 2 dc stitches into the first stitch. Then make 1 dc into each of the following 2 stitches. You'll need to make 2 dc into the next stitch and then dc 1 into each of the following 2 stitches. Keep repeating this across the round. After round 4, you should have 32 stitches completed. Slip stitch to join the rounds and chain up 2. To start round 5, join the round and make 2 chain stitches. The hat will now be the widest it's going to be. It will still look like a large circle. Making the Base of the Slouchy Hat Dc 1 into every stitch, slip stitch join, and chain 2 for rounds 5 through 10. Work 1 dc stitch into each stitch for the round. When you get to the end of round 5, slip stitch it to join the rounds and make 2 chain stitches. Continue to dc 1 stitch in each round until you've completed round 10. Since you aren't increasing or decreasing stitches, you should have 32 stitches for each round. For an extra slouchy hat, make 2 more rounds of dc 1 stitch. Make 1 chain and dc 1 into the round. For round 11, make 1 dc stitch into every stitch. When you reach the end of the round, slip stitch it to join it with the other rounds. You should still only have 32 stitches. Single crochet (sc) every stitch for round 12. To single crochet, insert your hook and pull up a loop. Wrap the yarn over and pull through 2 loops on your hook. Continue to sc every stitch for the round and then slip stitch to join the rounds. The single crochet stitch will tighten the brim of your slouchy hat so it stays in place. Finish off the round. Once you've joined the last round, wrap the yarn over your hook and pull it through. Keep pulling until the yarn is off of your hook. Pull the yarn to tighten it into a knot. Weave in the ends. You should have 1 tail at the top of the hat and 1 tail at the bottom. Thread 1 tail through the large-eye tapestry needle and sew it into the hat. Do this for the other tail and then your hat will be ready to wear.",
