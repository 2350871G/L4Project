Take your iron to a sink and turn it over to empty out any water in the tank. Water is bad for wood and can cause it to rot, so you need to get all of the moisture out of your iron before you start.Tip: The iron will heat the moisture that is trapped inside of the wood and cause it to evaporate from inside the wood. This method won\u2019t work if the stain is from anything other than water. If you can access the inside of the tank, wipe it down with a dry paper towel or cloth before reassembling it and putting it back into your iron. The sooner you can do this after the wood has been stained, the easier it will be to remove the stain. This method should be fine for any kind of wood. You can use a hair dryer instead if you don\u2019t have an iron, but it will take much longer."
