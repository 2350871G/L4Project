Apply small amounts of the mud at a time, making sure that there is as little extra mud left on the surface as possible. Spread the mud as evenly across the surface of the seam and the immediate area, helping to ensure there are no raised areas or clumps of mud along the surface of the drywall. Clean the knife after the mud is in position."

When taping a wall seam in a room with a high ceiling, it is fine to cut 2 sections of tape, if that will make the task more manageable."

      "description":"Starting at the top of the seam, gently maneuver the tape into position, pressing lightly on the tape surface with 1 hand while using the other to guide the tape as you move downward. This will squeeze a small portion of the mud from under the tape while leaving the area underneath smooth and flush with the surface of the sheetrock sections. If using 2 pieces of tape to cover a seam in a wall that is taller, make sure that the edge of the second piece laps under the first piece, as this will minimize the chances of the tape being noticeable."
