If you are planning on adding a lot of garnishes, you should account for that as well when you choose your glass. You may need a large glass with a heavy bottom just for stability if you want to add a ton of garnishes to the top of your drink."

          "description":"Rub a lemon wedge around the edge of the glass. Then dip the wetted rim of the glass into a pile of celery salt. Turn the glass lightly around, so that the entire rim is covered in the celery salt. Rimming the glass adds a kick of flavor every time you take a sip of your finished cocktail. If you don't want to taste the celery salt every time you take a drink, simply add a straw to your cocktail and drink out of that. This means that you have the choice between a sip with celery salt and a sip without. Or, simply rim half of the glass."

The amount of vodka usually varies between 1.5\u20133  fl oz (44\u201389 mL), depending on how strong you want the drink and how much Clamato you are going to add at the end. If you are making a cocktail that will fill a pint glass, you probably want to use the full 3  fl oz (89 mL). If you are making a cocktail in a small highball glass, then you probably should add about 1.5  fl oz (44 mL)."

You will want to leave a little bit of room in case you want to add more vodka to taste, or if you need room for lots of garnishes. The clam juice adds an additional layer of flavor that is pleasantly savory. This flavor is sometimes called umami. The addition of Clamato is the main difference between a Caesar and a Bloody Mary.
