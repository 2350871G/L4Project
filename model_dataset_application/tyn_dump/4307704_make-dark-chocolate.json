If you do not have an actual double boiler, place a heat-resistant bowl or pan over a saucepan. The lip of the bowl should be able to rest on the lip of the saucepan, and the bottom of the bowl should not extend low enough to touch the surface of the water in the saucepan."

          "headline":"Melt the cocoa butter.",
          "description":"Place the cocoa butter in the top part of your double boiler and heat it gently, stirring occasionally, until the block of butter completely melts. The cocoa butter should reach a temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius). Monitor the temperature using a candy thermometer. Consider breaking or cutting the cocoa butter into similarly sized pieces before adding it to the double boiler. Doing so ensures that the butter will melt quicker and at an even pace. Note that cocoa butter melts quickly and you should not allow it to overheat. In fact, you may want to turn the heat setting down from medium to low or medium-low. Chocolate that becomes too hot will develop a pale white coating known as \"bloom.\" True dark chocolate uses cocoa butter. If you are searching for a slightly healthier alternative, however, you can swap out the cocoa butter for coconut oil. The coconut oil should be melted and treated in the same way throughout the recipe."

          "description":"Stir the three ingredients together in a medium bowl until evenly mixed. You can use any cocoa powder for this recipe. Refined cocoa powders have a great taste, are easier to find, and less expensive, but the refining process removes some of the antioxidants of the cocoa. Natural or unprocessed cocoa powder is packed with more antioxidants and is the healthiest option. Use sugar, honey, or maple syrup for your sweetener. Note that dark chocolate prepared with sugar can be stored at room temperature but chocolate prepared with honey or maple syrup will need to be refrigerated. The amount of sweetener you use will change the cacao percentage of the dark chocolate.Using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) produces 85% dark chocolate. Using 1-1/2 Tbsp (22.5 ml) produces 73% dark chocolate. Using 2 Tbsp (30 ml) produces 60% dark chocolate."

Tempering chocolate causes the cocoa butter to harden in a specific crystalline pattern, and as a result, the dark chocolate will have a more appealing sheen and texture.

  "text":" Combining the Ingredients Prepare a small mold or tin. Use a 6-inch by 6-inch (15-cm by 15-cm) tin and line it with wax paper or parchment paper. You could use candy molds instead of a tin. Most molds do not need to be prepared in any special manner. Just make sure that the molds are clean and dry before use. Heat water in a double boiler. Fill the bottom portion of a double boiler with roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the double boiler on the stove and heat on medium until the water starts simmering. If you do not have an actual double boiler, place a heat-resistant bowl or pan over a saucepan. The lip of the bowl should be able to rest on the lip of the saucepan, and the bottom of the bowl should not extend low enough to touch the surface of the water in the saucepan. Melt the cocoa butter. Place the cocoa butter in the top part of your double boiler and heat it gently, stirring occasionally, until the block of butter completely melts. The cocoa butter should reach a temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius). Monitor the temperature using a candy thermometer. Consider breaking or cutting the cocoa butter into similarly sized pieces before adding it to the double boiler. Doing so ensures that the butter will melt quicker and at an even pace. Note that cocoa butter melts quickly and you should not allow it to overheat. In fact, you may want to turn the heat setting down from medium to low or medium-low. Chocolate that becomes too hot will develop a pale white coating known as \"bloom.\" True dark chocolate uses cocoa butter. If you are searching for a slightly healthier alternative, however, you can swap out the cocoa butter for coconut oil. The coconut oil should be melted and treated in the same way throughout the recipe. Combine the cocoa powder, sweetener, and vanilla separately. Stir the three ingredients together in a medium bowl until evenly mixed. You can use any cocoa powder for this recipe. Refined cocoa powders have a great taste, are easier to find, and less expensive, but the refining process removes some of the antioxidants of the cocoa. Natural or unprocessed cocoa powder is packed with more antioxidants and is the healthiest option. Use sugar, honey, or maple syrup for your sweetener. Note that dark chocolate prepared with sugar can be stored at room temperature but chocolate prepared with honey or maple syrup will need to be refrigerated. The amount of sweetener you use will change the cacao percentage of the dark chocolate.Using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) produces 85% dark chocolate. Using 1-1/2 Tbsp (22.5 ml) produces 73% dark chocolate. Using 2 Tbsp (30 ml) produces 60% dark chocolate. Combine the two mixtures. Gradually pour the cocoa powder mixture into the saucepan of cocoa butter, mixing thoroughly until the new product is smooth. Remove the mixture from the heat when ready. Allow the entire mixture to return to a temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) before removing it from the heat. Tempering the Chocolate Pour a portion of the chocolate onto a marble slab. Carefully pour roughly three-fourths of the chocolate mixture onto a glass cutting board or marble slab with a low rim around the edges. Set aside the remaining mixture. This tempering process may seem like a lot of extra work, but it is strongly recommended that you follow through with it nonetheless. Tempering chocolate causes the cocoa butter to harden in a specific crystalline pattern, and as a result, the dark chocolate will have a more appealing sheen and texture. Note that untempered dark chocolate may have trouble setting, look blotchy, have a distorted inner texture, or be prone to developing white fat bloom on the surface. Spread the chocolate. Use a flexible plastic scraper or palette knife to spread the chocolate out into as thin and even a layer as possible. Scoop up the chocolate. Use the knife to scoop the edges of the chocolate into its center, working as quickly as possible. Repeat for 10 minutes. Quickly spread the chocolate out into a thin layer, then immediately scoop it back into its center.
