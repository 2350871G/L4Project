This cloth is ideal for cleaning smudges and cloudiness. If you've lost or misplaced your microfiber cloth, find a soft, clean substitute cloth. Cotton, so long as it's clean, should be suitable. It is important to use fabric that is not treated with fabric softener as that can cause streaks on the lenses. You should avoid using: coarse fabrics, like wool and certain synthetic fabrics, facial tissue, or toilet paper, as these will cause tiny scratches to form on your lenses over time."
