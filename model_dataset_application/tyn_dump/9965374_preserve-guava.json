If the guavas aren't ripe yet, let them sit on the counter for 2-3 days until the skin yields when you press on the fruit. Avoid placing guava near a window because the heat and light can make it ripen too quickly. If the guava is taking a long time to ripen, try placing it in a paper bag with the top slightly open."

Other fruits can give off gasses that encourage ripening, and the bag will ensure that the guava is safe. Make sure the bag is clean and dry before putting the guava in it. Dirt and water can cause the guava to ripen further in the refrigerator. Remember to label the bag with the date for future reference."

Leave the bag open slightly at the top to let air circulate through the bag and the drawer. If possible, store the guava in a separate drawer from other fruits such as apples or oranges, which can cause the guava to go bad quickly."

          "description":"Refrigeration will slightly prolong the life of the guava, but be sure to use it in a timely manner. After 4 days in the refrigerator, the guava will be past ripe and should be thrown away. If you can't tell how ripe your guava is, press on the skin to feel if the fruit is very soft.

You can dispose of the skin, or you can place it in a compost pile with other food scraps. Be careful when using the peeler on the guava. The small, rounded shape can cause the peeler to slip."

Make sure it's large enough to fit all of the fruit with about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of empty space at the top of the container, called headspace. The headspace will allow for quicker freezing time, which keeps the guava fresh for a longer period in the freezer."

Pour the cooled syrup into the container or bag until the guavas are completely submerged, but remember to leave enough headspace in the container. If you've just made the simple syrup, let it cool before pouring it over the fruit. Warm syrup can cook the guava, causing a change in taste."

Label the container or bag with the date and let it sit in the freezer undisturbed for at least 12 hours before thawing. If you're going to freeze the guavas for a long period of time, avoid placing them in the door of the freezer. The door experiences more temperature changes than the rest of the freezer, which can cause thawing."

When you're ready to use it, place the guava in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours to thaw before taking it out of the container. If you're not sure how to use your frozen guava, you can try making juice, baking guava-based pastries, or even whipping up a guava barbecue sauce!"
