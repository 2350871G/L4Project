Each increase you work will add 1 extra stitch to the total number of stitches in the row. Adding a Stitch at the Beginning of a Row Make a chain of 2, 3, or 4 as required for the stitch. If your crochet pattern instructions say to work an increase at the beginning of a row, start by making a chain according to the type of stitch you\u2019re using. Crochet a chain of 2 for a single crochet, 3 for double crochet, or 4 for triple crochet.Tip: This chain is known as a turning chain and it provides slack for when you turn your work.

If you\u2019re working a single crochet stitch, don\u2019t yarn over to begin the stitch. However, some stitches require yarning over before you insert the hook into the stitch space. Begin the increase stitch as you normally would. For example, loop the yarn over the hook 1 time for a half-double or double crochet stitch or 2 times for a triple crochet stitch. Insert the hook at the base of the chain and work 1 stitch. Instead of skipping to the next stitch, locate the stitch space at the base of the chain. Insert your hook into this space to work a stitch into it and create a 1 stitch increase at the beginning of the row. Work the stitch as you normally would. For example, if you\u2019re adding a single crochet stitch to the row, insert the hook into the stitch, and then loop the yarn over the hook, and pull through 1 stitch. Then, yarn over and pull through 2 to complete the stitch. To do a half-double crochet stitch, yarn over the hook before you insert it, then insert the hook into the stitch, yarn over again and pull through 1. Yarn over again, and pull through 3 to complete the stitch. Working an Extra Stitch at the End of a Row Insert the hook under the last vertical strand in the row. This strand will be along the side of your crochet project at the end of the row you just worked. Push the hook under the strand.Tip: Make sure to yarn over the hook first if you\u2019re working a double, half-double, or triple crochet stitch. Yarn over once for a double or half-double crochet stitch and 2 times for a triple crochet stitch. Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull through 1. Once the hook is under the strand, yarn over 1 time. This is the same whether you\u2019re working a single, double, half-double, or triple crochet stitch. Then, pull through 1 to pull up a loop. The number of loops on your hook at this point will depend on the type of increase stitch you\u2019re working. For example, you\u2019ll have 2 loops on your hook for a single crochet stitch, 3 for a double or half-double crochet stitch, and 4 for a triple crochet stitch. Loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through 2. Next wrap the yarn over the end of the hook. Pull this loop through 2 loops and complete the stitch if you\u2019re working a single crochet stitch. If you\u2019re working another type of stitch, you\u2019ll need to follow a different strategy. For a half-double crochet, pull through all 3 loops on the hook. For a double crochet, yarn over and pull through 2 again to complete the stitch. For a triple crochet, yarn over again, and pull through 2. Then, yarn over again and pull through 2 again to complete the stitch. Repeat to add more stitches to the end of the row. Once you complete 1 increase stitch, you may turn your work around and continue to the next row or add another increase stitch in the same way as the first. Work the next increase stitch into the new vertical strand that you just created at the end of the row.",
