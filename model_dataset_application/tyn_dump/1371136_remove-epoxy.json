          "headline":"Put on gloves, goggles, and a respirator with gas and vapor cartridges.",
          "description":"When you heat epoxy, it produces vapors that can irritate your eyes, lungs, and mucus membranes. To protect yourself, put on sealed safety goggles and a respirator that can filter out gases and vapors. You should also wear rubber gloves that extend at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) past your wrist to protect your skin, preferably with elastic bands to help create a seal.Tip: Respirator cartridges are color-coded according to what kind of filtration they provide. For example, if your epoxy contains organic vapors, use a cartridge that is coded black, yellow, or olive. The best type of respirator cartridge will depend on what your epoxy is made of. Check the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for your product to find out what type of respirator cartridge and other protective equipment you need. Make sure your goggles completely cover your eyes and sit flush against your skin, with no openings to let in air. Alternatively, you can use a PPE respirator mask with a built-in eye shield. Always test the mask for proper seal and fit. If you\u2019re having trouble getting a good seal, you may need to trim any facial hair or get a better-fitting mask. If you smell any strong chemical odors while wearing your respirator, the respirator may not be working correctly or it may be time to replace the cartridge. Leave the area immediately so that you can inspect your respirator and make any necessary adjustments."

You can either place the object in acetone or drip acetone onto the surface where the epoxy is set in. Acetone will only soak into a wooden surface. When dealing with epoxy on plastic, marble, cement, vinyl, or metal, any chemical will interact with the top of the surface, but they will not penetrate down into the layers like they do with wood."

          "description":"The objective is to raise the epoxy\u2019s temperature to over 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C), its softening point. Work the heat gun in small strokes rather than letting it stay at the same position for minutes at a time. If the epoxy is on a plastic or wooden surface, keep an eye on the surface so you don't warm it up too much and burn it. As an alternative to using a heat gun, you can use a soldering iron. After the iron is heated, apply it directly to a specific area of the epoxy bond line. This will soften the epoxy. If the epoxy you are seeking to heat is located on an object rather than the floor tiling, you can place the object on a hot plate. This will accomplish the same thing as the heat gun, and is more frequently available."

Instead, work on segments that are about 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) in length. After you have one segment done, work on the segment right next to the first.

In this case, keep reheating the area and scrape until all the epoxy has been removed. Do not heat an area again right after you have already heated it. Wait a few minutes for the epoxy to cool off before you go back and reheat. Otherwise, you could cause the area to catch on fire.

    "If your windows and doors remained closed, you will likely breathe in chemical agents which are hazardous to your health.",
    "Make sure to turn your air conditioning or heating unit off so that the fresh air doesn\u2019t pull the vapors in.",
    "Choose a chemical that will soften epoxy.",
    "It is also critical that the chemical agent does not damage the surface that the epoxy is stuck on.",
    "Chemicals may damage certain surfaces such as cloth, plastic or vinyl.",
    "The strong chemicals may actually eat away at surfaces before they soften the epoxy glue.",
    "Always reference the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemicals you are using!",
    "The MSDS will include handling instructions and list the correct Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to use.",
    "Stay away from Class 3 and 4 oxidizers.",
    "These agents can cause spontaneous combustion or catch on fire down the road.",
    "Try a paint thinner.",
    "The acetone in most paint thinners can soften up hardened epoxy, but be prepared to let the epoxy and the object to which it is stuck soak for at least an hour.",
    "Use a commercial stripping agent.",
    "These are available at most hardware stores.",
    "Apply the stripping agent.",
    "You can either drip some of the agent directly onto the epoxy or put some on a washcloth and dab the epoxy.",
    "Either way, make sure that enough agent makes its way onto the epoxy.",
    "After the agent has been applied, wait at least 1 hour before you come back to it.",
    "Work in small steps, 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) at a time.",
    "If the area is too wide, the chemical agent will likely not work as effectively.",
    "Make sure that children and pets are not around when you are applying the chemical agent.",
    "Mix a cleaning solution.",
    "After the chemical stripping agent sits for an hour, you will need to neutralize it before you scrape it off.",
    "In a medium sized bucket, mix together 2-3 tablespoons (50-75 g) of trisodium phosphate and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water.",
    "You can either pour the mixture onto the stripping agent or dab it on with a sponge.",
    "Let it sit and neutralize the agent for at least 5 minutes.",
    "Scrape the epoxy resin from the surface.",
    "Scrape the resin off with a sharp, strong, plastic scraper.",
    "You will want to immediately place the epoxy in a paper towel and throw it away in a trash can.",
    "The goal is to not let the chemical agents get anywhere near you.",
    "If some epoxy is still stuck to the surface, soak the remaining epoxy in the chemical for a while longer before trying to scrape it off.",
    "When you have scraped the epoxy off, wash the area down with a rag soaked in warm water and soap.",
    "You do not want the chemicals to linger around, especially with children and pets in the house."
