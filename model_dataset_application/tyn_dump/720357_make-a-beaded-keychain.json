If you want a 5 to 6 in (13 to 15 cm) keychain, cut off 12 in (30 cm) of cord. The cord will be folded in half, so the actual length of the keychain will be half of whatever length you initially cut. You could also use twine or yarn, though they will wear through much quicker than wire, leather, or suede will."

If you\u2019re using wire, thread both ends of the wire through a crimp bead and push the bead to the top, so it\u2019s next to the keychain ring.

For example, you could make a rainbow-themed keychain with red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet or a color gradient by using deep purple, bright purple, light purple, and clear beads (or use any other color you like).
