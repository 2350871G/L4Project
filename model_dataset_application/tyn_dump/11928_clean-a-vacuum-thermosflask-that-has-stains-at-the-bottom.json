          "description":"Pour about half a cup (120ml) of distilled white vinegar into your stained flask. Then, shake in approximately one tablespoon (15ml) of baking soda for every cup the flask holds. The vinegar and baking soda mixture will froth up, so be sure to put the flask in the sink when you combine them. Baking soda and vinegar are excellent at killing germs and wearing down stains when acting together. It\u2019s important to use distilled white vinegar, as it's more acidic and will result in a better cleaning. It\u2019s also less likely to leave a lingering odor or taste in your flask, which other types of vinegar may do."

This will help loosen the dried stains from the inner surface of the flask, as well as distribute the vinegar and baking soda throughout. Leave the cap off the flask to keep the pressure from building up too much. Baking soda and vinegar are notoriously reactive. Putting the cap on the flask with both substances inside could result in a messy leak or even damage."

For especially thick buildup or heavy discoloration, give the vinegar and baking soda longer to set up."

These brushes were designed to clean out the types of bottles used to feed infants, which tend to be tall and narrow, so they\u2019ll work perfectly for scrubbing out your flask. Use the bottle brush to scour away any stubborn spots that the baking soda mixture hasn\u2019t already removed. A basic bottle brush only costs about $5, but it\u2019s a very useful tool to have on hand for difficult cleaning jobs. Be sure to run your bottle brush through the dishwasher after using it to clean a stained flask."

Don\u2019t forget to rinse around the opening of the flask. Your flask should now be clean and ready for use. Pat the body, mouth and cap of the flask dry with a clean towel, or let it sit and air dry. Give the opening of the flask a sniff.

Add the salt to the flask quickly so that the ice you put inside doesn\u2019t have a chance to melt. Use an extra half tablespoon (about 7ml) of salt if its a finer grain.

Shake for as long as you want, until you feel confident that the ice and salt have done their job. The salt and ice combination will essentially act as an \u201cexfoliant\u201d for the walls of the flask. Don\u2019t worry about damaging the metal that your flask is made of.
