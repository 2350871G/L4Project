          "description":"Remove the pillows, sheets, mattress, and box springs to access the frame components. Then, separate the individual pieces, like the side rails, supports, headboard, and footboard if you have them. Some frames have pieces that connect with screws, while others simply plug into one another. Store nuts, bolts, and other hardware in a secure container so you have it when you\u2019re ready to put the bed back together. Taking the bed apart allows you to get a more even coat of paint. It also makes moving the bed much easier. If you aren\u2019t able to take apart some pieces, you can still get a decent enough finish. Some of the corners, like where the frame parts connect, will be tough to paint well."

          "description":"If you are able to take the frame outdoors, you can prevent dust and paint fumes from getting into your home. Ideally, find a clear patch of ground where you are able to lay a drop cloth on the ground. Set the pieces on the drop cloth to protect them from scratches. You can also prop the pieces against things like a sawhorse, ladder, or old chair so you can more easily paint them. Make sure you\u2019re painting on a dry day with temperatures from 45 to 85 \u00b0F (7 to 29 \u00b0C). Paint doesn\u2019t dry as well during cold or damp days. If you\u2019re working indoors, pick a well-ventilated room, such as one with plenty of doors or windows to open. The garage is a good choice, for example."

          "description":"Sanding releases a lot of dust that isn\u2019t healthy to breathe in. When you\u2019re working with paint later, also take precautions to guard against paint fumes. Keep pets and other people out of the area until you are finished and have had a chance to clean up. Note that any harsh cleaners you use when preparing the bed can also be dangerous. Wear rubber gloves, full-sleeved clothing, and a respirator mask."

          "description":"These spots will lead to an uneven finish if they aren\u2019t taken care of. You can then lightly sand the rest of the frame if you wish. Doing so helps the new coat of paint adhere to the old one. Unless the frame is in bad shape, removing all of the paint isn\u2019t necessary. Try using a coarse wire brush to scrub away paint and rust on areas you can\u2019t finish with the sandpaper alone. If your frame isn\u2019t painted, inspect it for rust. Rust generally can be sanded off, but you could also try using a cleaner on it. For stubborn areas, you could use something like trisodium phosphate (TSP). TSP is a harsh cleaner and can damage metal if you\u2019re not careful with it, but it is effective at stripping paint and rust."

Don\u2019t leave any other noticeable debris behind. When you\u2019re done, wipe the frame dry or wait for it to dry on its own. Unless you\u2019re washing off a harsh cleaner like TSP, avoid soaking the metal. Exposing the frame to water could cause it to rust. Wring excess moisture out of the cleaning cloth before using it. If you\u2019re having a hard time clearing some stubborn debris, try mixing about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water. You can use a household dish detergent, but remember to rinse the soap off afterward."

Move from side to side and top to bottom, going at a relatively slow pace to give each frame piece a consistent coat of paint. Use slow, sweeping motions with the spray can. Avoid applying heavy coats of primer that drip. Note that you may not be able to prime both sides of a frame piece at once. Take care of it 1 side at a time instead."

Keep in mind that you will probably need to flip the metal over afterward so you can then prime the opposite side. Both sides have to be finished before you can begin painting. Priming an entire piece of metal in one go is difficult. To ensure it gets a good coating, prime the first side, flip the frame piece over after it dries, then prime the second side. Note that some brands of primer may dry out much more quickly than others. If you\u2019re not sure how long to wait, wait as long as you can to achieve a better finish."

Painting frame pieces is easier when you take them 1 side at a time. Focus on completing the accessible side with a smooth coat of paint.

Spray paint generally dries at a quick rate, so you won\u2019t need to wait very long before applying more of it. Plan on flipping the frame pieces over to complete the initial layer if you haven't already. Although spray paint can be painted over within a few minutes, it still takes at least an hour to completely dry.

Also, let each layer of paint dry before adding the next one. Apply as many layers of paint as you need to make the frame look consistent. The best part about most spray paints is that you don\u2019t have to wait as long as with regular paint to apply more of it. However, remember to flip the frame pieces and paint the opposite sides as well. Applying a second coat is usually a good idea.

    "Keep in mind that you will probably need to flip the metal over afterward so you can then prime the opposite side.",
    "Both sides have to be finished before you can begin painting.",
    "Priming an entire piece of metal in one go is difficult.",
    "To ensure it gets a good coating, prime the first side, flip the frame piece over after it dries, then prime the second side.",
    "Note that some brands of primer may dry out much more quickly than others.",
    "If you\u2019re not sure how long to wait, wait as long as you can to achieve a better finish.",
    "Spray the frame components with a rust-resistant paint.",
    "Select a quality spray paint made for use on metal.",
    "Then, hold the canister about 6 in (15 cm) above the frame piece, moving it in a sweeping motion from side to side and top to bottom.",
    "Cover each piece in a thin but consistent layer of paint.",
    "Painting frame pieces is easier when you take them 1 side at a time.",
    "Focus on completing the accessible side with a smooth coat of paint.",
    "The paint job may not look perfect at first, but that is okay.",
    "You can even it out with additional layers later.",
    "Let the paint dry for up to 1 hour.",
    "Refer to the manufacturer\u2019s directions for a more specific recommendation.",
    "Spray paint generally dries at a quick rate, so you won\u2019t need to wait very long before applying more of it.",
    "Plan on flipping the frame pieces over to complete the initial layer if you haven't already.",
    "Although spray paint can be painted over within a few minutes, it still takes at least an hour to completely dry.",
    "If you plan on handling the frame pieces, such as to flip them over, you have to wait before you can finish the initial coat of paint.",
    "Flip the frame pieces over to paint and dry them.",
    "You won\u2019t be able to finish painting most pieces all at once.",
    "After the paint dries on one side, you can tackle the opposite side on each frame piece.",
    "Paint them like you did originally, but remember to let them all dry completely before attempting to add any additional layers of paint.",
    "The painting process is long and takes some waiting, but if you take your time, the finished frame will look much better.",
    "Apply a second and third coat of paint if needed.",
    "Apply these coats like you did with the first, but pay extra attention to the corners and other tricky areas.",
    "Make sure they don\u2019t collect excess paint or go unpainted.",
    "Also, let each layer of paint dry before adding the next one.",
    "Apply as many layers of paint as you need to make the frame look consistent.",
    "The best part about most spray paints is that you don\u2019t have to wait as long as with regular paint to apply more of it.",
    "However, remember to flip the frame pieces and paint the opposite sides as well.",
    "Applying a second coat is usually a good idea.",
    "The third coat can be optional, so check the quality of the paint job to see if the frame would benefit from an additional coating.",
    "Paint screws and bolts to blend them in with the rest of the frame.",
    "Try sticking them through a piece of cardboard, leaving the heads exposed.",
    "Then, apply at least 1 coat of spray paint.",
    "The heads are often the only part visible on the frame, so painting them is enough to blend them in.",
    "If you wish to paint the other half of screws and bolts, rotate the cardboard while spraying them.",
    "These parts are tough to finish and painting them isn\u2019t always necessary.",
    "If they aren\u2019t visible on the frame, painting them isn\u2019t worth the hassle.",
    "If they are visible, you might decide you don\u2019t mind seeing them.",
    "Using a Brush to Paint Brush the frame pieces with a coat of metal primer.",
    "Select a quality paint brush as well as a primer specifically designed to work on metal.",
    "Dip the brush into the primer to avoid overloading it and getting a bunch of runs and drips on the frame.",
    "Then, work on the frame pieces one at a time, using smooth strokes to cover them in primer.",
    "You can also use a paint roller if you have one.",
    "Paint rollers are great for quickly covering large, flat surfaces like headboards.",
    "However, many metal bed frames have curves and thin components that are easier to reach with a brush.",
    "Remember to choose a primer that is compatible with the type of paint you plan on using.",
    "Let the primer dry for up to 24 hours.",
    "The primer may be dry to the touch as quickly as 30 minutes, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is ready to be painted over.",
    "Give it plenty of time to dry out, especially if you\u2019re in a cool or damp area.",
    "Make sure you have primed the entire frame before moving on.",
    "You will most likely need to wait for the primer to dry, flip the frame pieces over, then prime the other sides.",
    "Most pieces can\u2019t be painted all at once.",
    "Brush an acrylic or oil-based paint onto the metal.",
    "No matter what paint you choose, make sure it is compatible with the primer you used.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to paint, apply it like you did with the primer.",
    "Dip your brush into the paint, then go over the metal from side to side and top to bottom.",
    "Work steadily, applying a thin layer of paint, to avoid drips and runs.",
    "Acrylic or latex paint is less expensive than oil paint, dries more quickly, and is safer to use.",
    "As long as the frame is well-coated in primer, you won\u2019t have trouble applying the paint.",
    "These paints can wear out faster and be harder to clean, however.",
    "Oil paint, particularly enamel, is durable enough to resist chips and other damage.",
    "The downside is that it dries slowly, produce more fumes, and can fade faster than other types of paint.",
    "Let the paint dry completely before recoating the frame.",
    "The required drying time varies depending on what kind of paint you use.",
    "Acrylic and latex paints tend to dry out sufficiently within about 4 hours.",
    "Oil paints can take as long as 24 hours.",
    "Make sure the paint is dry to the touch before continuing.",
    "Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation on the paint can label for more specific information.",
    "The brand, as well as the environment you are in, can also affect how long you need to wait.",
    "Paint the opposite sides of the frame pieces and let them dry.",
    "Once the paint dries on one side, you can flip each frame piece over to get the other side.",
    "Coat the pieces in a thin but consistent layer of paint to finish them.",
    "Then, let the paint dry out before deciding if you wish to add additional coatings.",
    "Give the frame pieces plenty of time to dry out before flipping them or painting them a second time.",
    "Apply additional coats of paint as needed.",
    "Most projects benefit from a second coating to even out the finish.",
    "Some even need a third coating.",
    "Paint additional layers the same way as you did the first one.",
    "Remember to let each layer of paint dry before applying subsequent ones.",
    "This includes any designs you wish to paint, such as stars, scrolls, or other shapes.",
    "The base layer has to be completely consistent and dry before you can add the designs.",
    "Paint them on afterward.",
    "Paint frame screws and bolts inside a cardboard box.",
    "tick the screws and bolts through a piece of cardboard.",
    "The cardboard will keep them standing while you apply the paint.",
    "Apply a thin layer of paint to blend them in with the rest of the frame components.",
    "Rotate the cardboard as needed so you don\u2019t have to move each individual piece while painting.",
    "You don\u2019t need to paint any parts that aren\u2019t visible on the frame.",
    "The heads are usually the only parts visible.",
    "The grooved  shafts are harder to paint and worth avoiding if you can help it."
