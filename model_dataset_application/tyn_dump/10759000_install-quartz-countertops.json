          "description":"Use a measuring tape to get the dimensions of the cabinet tops to determine how much quartz you need. Be sure to account for the sink opening when ordering pre-cut quartz so that it comes with a space for your sink. Always choose quartz with unpolished edges to ensure that there are seams between the slabs. Choose between rounded, curved, and square edges for the outer edges of your quartz. Use 1.25 inch (3.2 cm) slabs for the best results. Select a pattern and color that fits with your space. Add an extra \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) to your dimensions to account for overhang."

          "description":"After receiving your pre-cut quartz slabs, the first thing to do is make sure they fit on your countertop. Place the slabs on top of their installation location\u2014also known as dry-fitting\u2014and make sure that each piece fits into its space without creating any large gaps between its surroundings. Quartz weighs 25 pounds (11 kg) per square foot, so have at least one person help you move the slabs to be safe. If you're using multiple quartz slabs, make sure that each one fits tightly against the other. If you removed your kitchen sink when removing your old quartz, lower it into place after dry-fitting your quartz to make sure that it fits. If your sink is still installed, that's fine too."

          "description":"Even with pre-cut quartz, you might have to make some adjustments to their size. Take note of any portions of the quartz that need to be removed or cut to fit the countertops and mark them off on the top and bottom with a straight edge and pencil. Start by placing your straight edge onto the top and draw a line to mark the region to be removed. Afterward, turn the quartz over and mark a line on the bottom parallel to the top one. Now, connect each line via lines on the sides. Make sure that there are 4 lines total\u2014the top, bottom, and 2 side lines."

Remove the flange\u2014the small rim located under the bolt\u2014and lift the blade out. Finally, swap in your new diamond blade, reattach the flange, and retighten the bolt.

With your quartz on a flat surface, start sawing along the top penciled line. Apply gentle pressure downward onto the quartz with your left hand and down onto the saw using your right hand. Always check that the teeth of the diamond blade are pointing opposite to the quartz. Repeat this process with the other side of the quartz to cut it in half. Remove the blade from the quartz every 30 seconds to keep the temperature low."
