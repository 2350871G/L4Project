Grip the handle firmly with your dominant hand and use the heel of the palm of your non-dominant hand to press down on the knife's tip opposite to the cutting edge. Move the knife up and down over the parsley to cut it into pieces. Continue cutting your parsley until it's in small, manageable pieces. You can also use kitchen scissors to cut your parsley pieces or rip them apart with your hands. However, these options won't give you clean cuts."

Afterwards, cut each individual clove lengthwise into slices as thin as you possibly can. Turn the pieces 90 degrees and slice them crosswise. Continue alternating between lengthwise and crosswise cuts until your garlic is finely minced. To finely mince garlic, you must cut your cloves into very small pieces. Rest your knuckles against each clove piece to hold them in place. Keep a slight bend in your knuckles\u2014the knife should rest against the cloves and create a gap between the garlic and your fingertips."
