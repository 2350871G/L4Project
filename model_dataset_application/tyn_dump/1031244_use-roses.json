Turn a regular buttercream icing into rose icing by beating in \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoons (1.25-2.5 ml) of rose water. Add touch of pink food coloring to make it even rosier. Substitute rose water for vanilla in your favorite baked goods, such as cakes or muffins. The fragrance is more subtle when it\u2019s baked. For a change of pace, stir a teaspoon (5 ml) of rose water into lemonade. The floral scent works well with the bright lemon flavor. Serve over ice and float a few petals in each glass."
