If you do it inside, or even in a garage, you may want to lay newspaper down so the dust doesn\u2019t get everywhere. It\u2019s also probably best to wear old clothes. You don\u2019t need to spend too long on this, just check for any bumps or especially rough spots. If you don\u2019t see anything, then you don\u2019t need to worry about sanding. Even if the pot does have bumps, you have the choice of leaving them to add texture to the look after you paint it."

          "description":"This is good for new pots because it will loosen any stickers for easier removal. It is also good for pots you have planted in before because it will loosen any dirt. If the pot has no stickers and you can tell for sure it is clean, it may be alright to skip the soak. Although you\u2019ll have to leave the pot to dry at various stages in the process, while it soaks, you can use the time to gather your other supplies and set up your paint area. If you don\u2019t want to leave it for an hour, check it at 10 minute intervals and if it seems clean to your satisfaction, move forward with the process."

          "description":"While soaking the pot may loosen the dirt, used pots are likely to need a scrubbing to get them completely clean. The paint will not go on even or stick properly if there is any dirt or debris. Your pots may need a soft brush so you don\u2019t scratch them too much, but if there are any stubborn spots you can switch to a wire brush for extra strength. If you happen to scratch the pot any while brushing it, there\u2019s no need to worry because the paint will cover it and even it out."

The time it takes to dry may depend on the size of the pot. Drying may take a few hours, so plan ahead for this part so you don\u2019t waste your time while you wait."

You can balance the pot by putting a hand on the bottom (which will now be on top), because the bottom won\u2019t be painted. Use something that is big enough to balance the pot. You can use a canning jar, a soup can, a peanut butter jar, or another cylindrical container. The size of jar you\u2019ll need will depend on the size of the pot. If you are painting a large pot, this technique may not be an option. This is not mandatory, but it is easier than holding the pot in your hands for the whole time as you paint."

Since clay pots allow water to soak through, this creates a barrier between the plant and the paint on the outside of the pot. Sealer is usually found in the paint section. It\u2019s best to do this outside, or at least in a well-ventilated garage. Spraying this kind of product inside is not safe. Drying may take up to 24 hours. Check the product instructions to be sure. Seal the inside and outside of the pot. If you don\u2019t seal the inside, when you water the plant the water will soak through the pot and can make the paint loosen and peel off. If your pots are decorative and will not have real plants in them, it is not necessary to seal them."

This will help the paint stick to the pot better. Plus, primer helps cover the red color of the clay. Prime all around the outside, but also extend the primer at least an inch down the inside of the pot. Although some sources say to paint the bottom, it\u2019s best not to put any primer or paint on the bottom of the pot as this can affect proper drainage."

You may want a couple brushes of different sizes, especially if you want to paint any kind of patterns on the pot. If you have bristled brushes that you want to use, it won\u2019t hurt anything.

With this variation, you\u2019ll tape and paint over the tape for the first coat. Once the paint dries, you\u2019ll take the tape off and paint the areas that were under the tape before. You can re-tape over the areas you already painted so you keep the lines betweens colors sharp.

It\u2019s not necessarily harmful to paint the bottom, but it can\u2019t cause the pot to not drain as well as it should.

If the paint is not dry, new coats will pull the paint off of the pot. You can use a different color for the second coat if you want to give the pot a shaded look.
