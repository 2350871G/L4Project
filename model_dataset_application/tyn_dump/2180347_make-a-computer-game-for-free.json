Adventure Games: where the game-play relies on non-confrontational approaches that requires little or no quick reflexes. The game progresses through solving puzzles, performing tasks or interacting with the environment of the game and characters in it. Action-Adventure Games: where the game-play style is a mixture of the two previous genres. For example, there are long term goals/tasks the requires quick reflexes to be completed and the game progresses through performing sequential tasks, each or some of which is a kind of a mini-game that is action based. Role Playing Games (RPGs): where the players take on specific \"roles\" in the game's setting and progress their character in-game through acquiring skill-points or experience. Some of these games are turn based but some use a more real-time approach. Massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs) is a sub-genre of this genre, where multiple players share the same game environment and some tasks requires the cooperation of multiple players to perform. Simulation Games: where the game-play depends on simulating aspects of real-life or some imaginary fantasy setting. Strategy Games: where the playing style requires mostly careful planning and skillful thinking. Board and Card Games: the game play is based on a set of cards that needs to be handled according to a certain set of rules or on manipulating \"pieces\" on a board."
