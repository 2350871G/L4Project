Do not use cotton thread of any kind; the tannin in the leather will degrade the cotton over time. Once you thread the  needle, knot the thread. Leather needles have a specific point. Rather than having a conical shape, they have a triangular or pyramidal shape. You can find the needles and the thread in craft shops and fabric stores."

It does not matter where you start sewing, but it might be easier to start in a corner. Use a thimble. Leather needles are designed to pierce leather. The delicate skin on your finger is no exception. If you weren't able to undo the lining, start sewing from the back of the patch. This way, the knot won't be visible.
