Winter jasmine blooms from June to October in the Southern Hemisphere, and from March to April in the Northern Hemisphere. Summer jasmine blooms from April through June in the Northern Hemisphere, and from November through January in the Southern Hemisphere. Flowers form on the previous year's growth. Pruning immediately after flowering gives that growth time to mature so your plant can flower fully next season."

If your jasmine is thick, start at the bottom and work up a single stem, clearing excessive growth as you go. Then move to the next stem.

Remove dead or damaged leaves entirely from their stems, but leave the vertical vine if it remains healthy. Once every other year, identify weaker vines that are thin with fewer blooms.

Branches that cross other branches will rub against each other and damage each other.

Set bamboo canes directly in the pots, and twine the young vines around these canes. Vines should start to appear within 4 weeks. Allow the plant to grow until its roots fill the starter or seedling pot, then move outside in early spring. Leave the vines trained around the bamboo canes when you move your jasmine outdoors. When you plant your jasmine, set it out 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) from the supports to make sure the roots of the plant will be exposed to adequate rainfall. Make sure the plant is 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) away from the wall or any solid structure, so it has enough room to develop a complete root system."

Adjust the canes into a fan shape. This will give each of your vines room to grow before they start crowding and tangling with each other.
