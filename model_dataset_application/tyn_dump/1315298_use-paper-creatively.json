These are artworks that are like drawings, except instead of drawing shapes and coloring them in, you create the shapes from paper. For 2D paper art, use paper in different colors and cut out each different part of your \"drawing\". If you're making a face, for example, you'll need to cut out the eyes (possibly in several different colored pieces), the nose, the mouth, the skin of the face, the hair (again, probably in different pieces), and other details. The more pieces you cut out, the more detailed you can make your piece. For 3D art, you'll cut out thin strips of paper, about the width of 2-3 spaghetti noddles, and place them on their sides on another sheet of paper. Fold, bend, and spiral them to create different shapes in outline."
