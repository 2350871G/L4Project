To measure it yourself, use a soil thermometer at a depth of 8 inches (20 cm); it should register this temperature at 8 a.m. in the morning for at least a week and a half before you plant. Cotton doesn't tolerate frost, so you want to plant well after the last frost. You can look up the dates for the typical last frost in your area online. Keep in mind that cotton takes a long growing season, so if you don't have at least 3-4 months of heat, you may not be able to grow it."
