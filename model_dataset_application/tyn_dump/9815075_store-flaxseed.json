One advantage of plastic bags is that they come in multiple sizes, which makes them useful for storing leftovers, meal prepping, and packing lunches.

Make sure your grains go straight into a sealed jar or piece of Tupperware after they've been processed. This will help extend their shelf life to its maximum potential. Double check that the lid is nice and secure, and try not to open the container unless it's to portion out a scoop. Try to use up your ground flaxseed as soon as possible in order to take advantage of its full flavor and nutritional value.
