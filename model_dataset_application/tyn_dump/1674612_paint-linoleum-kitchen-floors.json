Also, if your linoleum is extremely wavy, it is likely breaking down from the underside, in which case you may want to consider replacing the flooring."

      "headline":"Clean the floors.",
      "description":"Scrub the floors thoroughly with a scrub brush and a heavy-duty tri-phosphate (TSP) cleaner (found in your local home improvement or hardware store) in order to remove every last trace of grease and grime. This is especially important for ensuring paint adheres to linoleum kitchen floors. If you find that the surface of the linoleum is still glossy, use a degreaser or a wax stripper to remove the final layer of protective wax. Rinse the floor until it is cleared of any cleaner residue and allow it to dry completely."

      "headline":"Sand the floors.",
      "description":"Use a light to medium grit sandpaper to scour the surface of the floors before painting linoleum, being sure to cover every part of the floor, even in edges and corners. This removes any remaining traces of wax that you may not be able to see and roughs up the surface enough to grip the paint."

      "description":"Choose a primer that is formulated especially for floors, and use a roller and brushes as necessary to complete the application. Apply as many coats as it takes to produce a smooth surface for painting linoleum. Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, which may be a period of several days."
