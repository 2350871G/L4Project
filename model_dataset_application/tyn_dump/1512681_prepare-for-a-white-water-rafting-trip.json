          "description":"Shoulder strain is a common whitewater rafting injury, and proper stretching will keep you loose. Spend five minutes before every pre-rafting workout stretching your muscles. To keep your shoulders loose, stretch your arms up and then across your body, holding each stretch for 60 seconds."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Build upper body muscles with push ups, pull ups, and chest presses.",
          "description":"You will need a lot of upper body strength to navigate your way through Class III to V rapids. With push ups, your form is crucial. When down on the ground, set your hands at a distance slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and imagine your body as a straight line. If push-ups are too difficult, do four sets of wall push ups with two-minute rests between sets. Keep this up every other day, with the same form. Once you can do 4 sets of 20 repetitions of wall push ups, you can progress to the inclined floor position."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Strengthen your core with planks.",
          "description":"Planks and side planks are common core exercises that help develop muscles that stabilize your body when leaning into your paddle. Plant your hands directly under your shoulders like you\u2019re about to do a push-up. Alternatively, place your weight on your elbows and forearms. Ground the toes into the floor, and hold for 20 seconds. As an additional core strengthening exercise, lay on your back and touch each elbow with the opposite knee then straighten each leg."

Step forward with one leg, bringing your hips toward the ground until both knees bend at a 90-degree angle. Hold dumbbells while doing lunges for maximum resistance. For squats, stand with your head facing forward and your feet shoulder-width apart. Sit back and down like you're sitting into an imaginary chair, with your thighs parallel to the floor. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat, doing three sets of ten."

          "description":"You will not be huffing and puffing in the middle of your river trip if you have several weeks of cardio training under your belt. Take an extended bike, run, or swim to build your cardiovascular health. Include sprints, hills, and obstacles. Break it up with some high intensity interval training. Do intense work with intermittent rests using either jump rope, burpees, stationary cycle, elliptical machine, or even boxing to build up your cardiovascular health."

Wet suits are also often available to rent at the outfitter\u2019s in cooler weather."

When packing, choose loose, woven materials such as wool, polypro, fleece, micro fleece, polyester or any other outdoor material that dries quickly. Avoid any cotton clothing, especially in cooler weather. It will weigh you down and increase the release of body heat. Do not wear anything with a hood, including ponchos and rain jackets. These are unsafe on the river. In cooler weather, opt for a synthetic base layer, such as Capilene or polypropylene, a middle layer of fleece, and an outer waterproof jacket.

Do not pack a new pair of shoes, which will leave you sore and cause blisters. Waterproof hiking boots are also not recommended, since they fill with water and weigh you down. Water shoes are often too thin and slippery. Avoid crocs and flip flops, which are easily lost. If a rafter shows up wearing only flip flops, a guide might offer to secure them with duct tape."

The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommends reapplying any sunscreen every two hours, regardless of its SPF. Even \"waterproof\" sunscreen is only water resistant for 40-80 minutes.
