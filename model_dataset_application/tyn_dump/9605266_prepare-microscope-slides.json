Most microscope slides are flat on top and bottom and rectangular in shape. They are clear, allowing light from the microscope to pass through and illuminate the translucent sample specimen. If your slide is dirty or smudged, you won\u2019t be able to effectively examine your specimen. If you find that your microscope slide has any contamination on it\u2014including your own fingerprints\u2014give it a quick wash with liquid soap and water. Dry the slide using a clean cloth.

If light cannot fully pass through the specimen and into the microscope\u2019s eyepiece, you won\u2019t be able to see the specimen through the microscope. Some of the specimens (e.g., a strand of hair or an insect wing) are thin and translucent on their own, and will not need to be sliced with a razor blade."

If you are using a concave slide (in which one side dips down), place the specimen in the center of the concave area. Mount the specimen on a concave slide if you\u2019re concerned that the specimen will roll or slide off the flat slide. For example, use a concave slide if you\u2019re preparing a curled flower petal that rolls to one side or the other. For all other types of specimens, a flat slide will work fine."

The slip will also protect the sample specimen in case one of the microscope\u2019s users accidentally lowers the lens so much that it taps the specimen. Cover slips are very thin, transparent pieces of glass or, more commonly, plastic. Each slip is about \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) in both width and length.
