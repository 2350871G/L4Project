Take some leftover wrapping paper or tinsel and wrap the outside (but allow it still to open) or get colored duct tape and tape all around, or even color it with markers. Either way, the box should look adorned and fancy, and should not show any bald spots."

You can put silly or scary things inside, like plastic frogs or spiders, to represent the evils of the world that Pandora let out, or you can add fun little things that people should be allowed to take."

      "description":"Pandora was given her box and told never to open it under a single circumstance, but she did because it was so tempting. You can give your box to a person and tell them never to open it like Pandora, or you can put it out in a library or classroom, telling people who pass never to open it. Either way, you should tell people the story of Pandora and how she opened the box even though she was forbidden to, and you should put a sign on the box with something like \"Pandora's Box\" or \"Never Open\"."
