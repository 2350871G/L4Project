You could also reserve an out-of-the-way corner of a big yard for a private lounging area. An open, scenic spot with no trees or large plants nearby will work best. Whatever space you choose should be roomy enough to move around in comfortably and hold a few pieces of patio furniture, along with any guests you might be entertaining in the future. Consider drainage issues, such as runoff from the patio surface and edges, to ensure water won\u2019t pool on the patio. If you\u2019ll be installing an awning or overhang, consider whether you\u2019ll also need gutters or downspouts to direct the water away from the patio."

It will also allow you to get as creative as you like while planning your layout. Build your patio along the contours of a winding walkway or in a small alcove where it would be difficult to find space for a traditional square or rectangular setup.

    "A hand trowel will also be useful for keeping the edges of the site clean and precise.",
    "You can use a tiller to break up the soil first and make it easier to hand shovel the required depth and remove by wheel barrow.",
    "Large areas may require a skid steer or mini-excavator or tractor with a backhoe and front bucket attachment.",
    "When it\u2019s complete, your paver patio should sit at or slightly above ground level.",
    "Use an elevated level to create slope as you dig.",
    "A slight slope is necessary to promote runoff during wet weather.",
    "Cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece of scrap wood and tie it to the end of a level.",
    "That way, you can ensure that your finished patio has 1 in (2.5 cm) of drop off every 4 feet (1.2 m).",
    "Ensure the slope angles away from the patio and add drainage if necessary.",
    "You may be able to get by with a perfectly level patio if you live in a place with a hot, dry climate, or if you\u2019ve elected to place the patio beneath an overhang.",
    "Leave room for underground utilities.",
    "If you need to bury electrical cable for outdoor lighting, do it now before you begin adding the substrate\u2014dirt is more forgiving on cables than rougher materials like sand and gravel.",
    "Make sure the wire or cable is rated for direct burying or is in an approved conduit.",
    "Notch the soil around the edges of the pit with your trowel and lay the cable in a straight path, avoiding kinks, coils, and splices wherever possible.",
    "Take a few moments to check whether your lighting elements are functional.",
    "Otherwise, you'll just have to dig them back up if something goes wrong later on.",
    "Tamp the soil to flatten it.",
    "Use a hand tamper or a plate compactor and work your way inward from the perimeter of the site.",
    "This will provide a more stable foundation for the substrate and prevent the paver stones from shifting once they\u2019ve been put in place.",
    "As an optional step, you can also roll out a sheet of landscaping fabric at this point to act as a buffer for weeds and prevent them from taking root beneath the gravel base.",
    "Pour 2-3 in (5.0-7.6 cm) of crushed gravel for the base.",
    "Dump the gravel into the pit and use a heavy iron rake to distribute it out to the edges.",
    "Make sure you spread the gravel evenly, adding more until you reach the desired depth.",
    "As you did with the soil, tamp the gravel down until it\u2019s firmly set.",
    "Wetting the gravel can help you distribute and pack it evenly.",
    "Add 1-2 in (2.5-5.0 cm) of leveling sand.",
    "This layer will fill in the cracks in the gravel.",
    "It will also give the paver stones something to settle into, offering additional stability.",
    "Snip a corner off of the bag and sift it slowly, guiding it from one side of the pit to the other.",
    "Level the sand with a flat board.",
    "To avoid over or under-filling the base, cut a couple lengths of 1-in (2.5-cm) PVC pipe and place them parallel to one another down the middle of the pit before you pour in the sand.",
    "Then, drag a flat board, like a 2x4, along both pipes to level the heap.",
    "When you\u2019re done, pull out the pipes, fill in the depressions, and tamp the entire surface flat.",
    "Rather than dumping in all of the sand at once, proceed a few feet at a time\u2014pouring, smoothing, and repeating.",
    "Installing the Pavers Lay down the paver stones from the outer perimeter.",
    "Press the pavers gently into the leveling sand, starting at one corner of the pit and working your way toward the center.",
    "Leave a narrow gap between each stone, no less than \u215b in (0.32 cm) and no more than \u00bd in (1.27 cm)\u2014you\u2019ll be filling in this space later with more sand.",
    "Use photos of completed patios as a reference when figuring out the placement of your pavers.",
    "It will take longer to embed raw stones or pavers with natural finishes, as they\u2019ll need to be adjusted to the right height individually.",
    "Keep a consistent amount of space between each paver.",
    "It may help to separate the stones with a sheet of plywood or with spacer blocks as you install them.",
    "Slide the plywood against the edge of the pit and drop your first stone.",
    "Then, turn the sheet 90 degrees to create a gap between the neighboring stone.",
    "Continue one row or pattern section at a time, repositioning the plywood after laying down each paver.",
    "Keep uniformly-shaped pavers as close together as possible.",
    "Leaving space between them not only requires more joint sand to fill in the gaps, it also reduces shifting later when the joint sand loosens or is washed or blown away.",
    "Check your slope as you go.",
    "Keep your level and a straightedge handy and refer to them frequently.",
    "Aim for approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) of drop off every 4 ft (1.2 m).",
    "This will ensure that your patio will be able to drain as needed.",
    "Adjust the amount of substrate in a given section as needed by tamping or redistributing it.",
    "For a flat ground patio, look for the substrate to be as level as possible before proceeding.",
    "Cut the pavers to fit if necessary.",
    "Some full-sized stones may be too big to go in a certain spot.",
    "In this case, a wet saw or circular saw with a concrete blade, which can be rented from a home improvement store, will be required to cut through the hard stone.",
    "Assuming that you don\u2019t have access to a power saw, you can also break down the pavers the old fashioned way using a mallet and chisel.",
    "When you come to a paver that won\u2019t fit, mark it with a piece of chalk so you\u2019ll know where you need to cut.",
    "Always wear gloves, a face mask, and ear and eye protection anytime you\u2019re working with power saws.",
    "Tap the pavers into place with a rubber mallet.",
    "Pound the top of the stones to set them deeper into the sand.",
    "This can be a painstaking process, but it\u2019s crucial for ensuring that the pavers are stable enough to stand, walk and set furniture on.",
    "Don\u2019t attempt to secure the pavers by simply stomping on them.",
    "This may cause them to sink too deep, or knock them out of alignment.",
    "If you find that the pavers are sitting unevenly, you may need to work them deeper into the substrate by hand.",
    "Fill the gaps between the pavers with another layer of sand.",
    "Spread an additional \u00bd in (1.25 cm) of levelling sand over the tops of the stones.",
    "Use a broom to carefully push the sand into the spaces between the pavers.",
    "Sweep in several different directions to fill the joints completely.",
    "Any remaining sand can be swept off later.",
    "Jointing sand can offer a permanent alternative to ordinary sand.",
    "This substance contains additives that form a solid bond after being exposed to moisture.",
    "Vacuum up any stubborn sand that collects where it's not supposed to, or use a leaf blower to blast it out into the far reaches of the yard.",
    "Install edging, if desired.",
    "If you want your patio to have a neat and uniform edge, you can install paver edging.",
    "Choose from plastic, concrete, metal, or wood.",
    "Position the edging along the perimeter of the patio pavers.",
    "Secure it with galvanized spikes per the paver manufacturer\u2019s guidelines.",
    "Hose down the entire patio.",
    "A good spray will help the pavers settle and pack the underlying substrate down tight.",
    "Just make sure you don't oversaturate the area, or you could end up with a swamp instead of a relaxing outdoor lounge.",
    "Once the water has had time to dry, you can replace your furniture and kick back!",
    "Wet the patio every hour for the first 3 hours to accelerate the compacting process.",
    "Seal the patio once it\u2019s dried.",
    "To keep the sand in the joints and protect your new pavers, you should apply a sealer to the patio once it is completely dry.",
    "Use a 4-inch (10-cm) brush to apply sealer to the outsider perimeter of the patio.",
    "Then use a garden-style pump to spray sealant over the rest of the patio.",
    "Allow it to dry completely, then repeat the process to apply a second coat.",
    "Paver patio sealer can be found at home improvement stores."
