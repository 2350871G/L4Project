          "headline":"Grind your beans.",
          "description":"The grind of your beans is going to be a large factor in how close you get to having a drink that resembles an espresso. If you are buying ground beans, then look for an espresso grind. If you are grinding your own beans, still look for coffee that says \"espresso beans\" or \"espresso\". While there is no actual espresso type of bean, often commercial roasters will have an espresso bean. This will give you a taste and consistency to which you are used to because it is roasted to bring out the espresso flavor. If you grind your own beans, you will want a grinder that can offer you an espresso grind. Burr grinders are grinders which actually grind the beans between two burrs. These grinders crunch up a few beans at a time and grind the bean into a nice even powder. Blade grinders can be effective as well. However, with a blade grinder, you\u2019re using a sharp propeller to chop the beans. This method can be less consistent. The espresso ground is very fine. It is finer than what you would have if you were grinding beans for a regular French press or a drip coffee maker. The fine ground contributes to the flavor and ability to mix with the hot pressure of water. You don\u2019t want an espresso grind to be so fine that it goes through your filter. The problem with this fine of a grind in a French press is that the filter has a larger mesh. It should be like sand. You may then want to make your grind slightly more coarse, but not much. Unless you don\u2019t mind a bit of grounds in the bottom of your cup."

Which when prepared in an espresso machine uses about 16-21 grams of grounds per 1 cup of water. Since your French press is larger, try doubling your proportions.

However, this does not mean that you should steep your espresso too long just to get a stronger, more espresso-like flavor. Steeping is another area for experimentation. Just be aware of one rule: The length of steep time controls extraction. Too short and the coffee will be under-extracted and sour; too long and the coffee will be over-extracted and bitter."

    "Place the pan on a towel or surface that isn\u2019t hot but that won\u2019t get damaged by the heat from the pan.",
    "Blend the milk.",
    "Angle your pot and set an immersion blender in the shallow end of the pot.",
    "Froth the milk on high speed until the foam holds, about 2 to 3 minutes blending on high.",

    "Stir by rotating the whisk back and forth between the palms of your hands.",
    "Stir until your milk is bubbly and frothy.",
    "Pour the frothy milk into a jar with a lid.",
    "Once you\u2019ve poured your milk, tighten the lid and give the jar a good shake.",

    "Place the bowl in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes, or until the temperature reaches just above freezing.",
    "The thicker the milk or cream you use, the thicker your foam will be.",
    "However, using 2% or low-fat milk may be easier if you are frothing by hand.",
    "Lower-fat milks usually include whey proteins that are critical stabilizers for milk foam.",
    "Check on your bowl to make sure the milk hasn\u2019t frozen.",
    "There should not be any ice crystals.",
    "Prepare your espresso in your French Press.",
    "While the milk is being cooled, make your espresso using the first method.",

    "Blend the milk, then shake and microwave.",
    "Another way is to blend and shake.",
    "But not microwave.",
    "Tip the bowl and insert your immersion blender.",
    "You can also pour your milk into a smaller container for easier blending or whisking.",
    "Blend until there is a good, stiff froth.",
    "If you don\u2019t have an immersion blender, you can use a whisk and stir the milk in a smaller container.",
    "Stir by rotating the whisk back and forth between the palms of your hands.",
    "Stir until your milk is bubbly and frothy.",

    "This won\u2019t leave enough room for the milk to foam.",
    "Shake until the milk is bubbly and nice and foamy.",
    "You should be shaking for about 30 to 60 seconds.",
    "You can leave the cold froth as is, or microwave if you want extra foam.",
    "Leaving the froth cold will mean that you have to scoop it right away onto your drink before it settles back in.",
    "Spoon out the froth onto your coffee and enjoy.",
    "Take a spoon and place a dollop of froth onto the top of your drink.",
    "Sprinkle with cinnamon for added flavor.",
    "You can also pour the milk mixture into your drink if you like.",

    "Place the cream in the bowl with the whisk and let it sit in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.",
