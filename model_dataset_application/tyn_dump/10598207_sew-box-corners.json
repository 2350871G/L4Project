Use safety pins to secure the corners before you sew! If you like the way it looks, then add box corners to the item. Adding Box Corners to Raw Fabric Measure the length, height, and width of the surface. Use a measuring tape to find the dimensions of the item you want to cover. Write down these dimensions. This will allow you to create a custom sized cover for the item, such a for a tablecloth or fitted sheet. Add the length to the height and 2x the desired seam allowance. Use a calculator to ensure that you get an accurate result. This will give you the length you need to cut out of your fabric. Label your result as the fabric length.

Use your calculations to find the required dimensions of the fabric. Then, mark the fabric to these dimensions and cut it using a sharp pair of scissors. For example, if you determined that the length of your fabric should be 21 in (53 cm) and the width should be 15 in (38 cm), then measure your fabric, mark it to indicate the measurements, and cut. Hem the edges of the fabric for your desired seam allowance. Use the same seam allowance that you included to calculate the dimensions of your fabric. Then, lay the fabric with the wrong (back) side facing up. Fold over the edges of the fabric and sew a straight stitch to secure the fold. For example, if you used 0.5 in (1.3 cm) as your seam allowance, then fold the fabric over by 0.5 in (1.3 cm) and sew to secure it. Cut out a square the size of the surface height plus the seam allowance. Use the same height measurement that you used to calculate the length and width of your fabric. Then, add your seam allowance to it. Cut out a square that measures these dimensions in each of the corners of your item. For example, if your item\u2019s surface height is 8 in (20 cm) and the seam allowance is 0.5 in (1.3 cm), then the square you cut out of each corner will need to be 8.5 by 8.5 in (22 by 22 cm).

For example, to create a 4 in (10 cm) wide bottom on a bag, cut out a square that measures 2 in (5.1 cm). Pin the raw edges together with the front sides facing in. Once you have finished cutting out the corners, pin the raw edges so that the right (front) sides of the fabric are facing each other. Line up the edges so that they are even. Insert a pin every 2 in (5.1 cm) along the raw edges of the fabric. Arrange the pins so that they are perpendicular to the raw edges to make it easier to pull them out as you sew. Sew a straight stitch along the pinned edges of the corners. Use the seam allowance to determine how far to sew from the raw edges of the corner.
