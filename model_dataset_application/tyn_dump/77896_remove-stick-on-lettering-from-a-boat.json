      "description":"If you don't want to take the boat to a company, then you can try for yourself. Start with a hair dryer or heat gun. (Be very careful when using a heat gun as they have the power to blister gelcoat.) Heat up the  surface of the sticker then while heating the sticker slowly start to peel back the sticker with your nails or a razor blade once you have it started it is best to use your hands and slowly pull while heating what is still sticking this method will leave no sticky residue."

      "headline":"Opt to use a blade.",
      "description":"This way also works but will leave a sticky adhesive residue. Start with a razor blade  It is usually best to get the long, skinny razors with extend able blades, but this does depend somewhat on personal preference. The short fat ones work as well. Try slipping the blade under the letters. Most letters you should be able to get off this way. As long as you are careful, you shouldn't have a problem scratching the fiberglass, but watch what you're doing with the blade."
