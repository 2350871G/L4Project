          "description":"Run the water into a measuring cup until you have exactly 1 cup (240 mL). Add the Borax powder to the water, then stir the mixture until the powder dissolves completely. Set the Borax solution aside. The Borax is the \u201cactivator\u201d for your slime, causing the glue to go from a sticky liquid to a spongy semi-solid goo that retains its shape when squished, squeezed, and stretched. If you don\u2019t want to use Borax, you can also substitute an equal amount of a contact lens solution containing boric acid, which will create a similar chemical reaction when combined with the glue. There's no need to mix contact lens solution with water since it's already a liquid. Adding 1\u20132 tablespoons (15\u201330 mL) can make your slime a little stretchier, though."

If you only want a handful of slime to play with, 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) or so should be plenty. If you want to make enough to keep both hands busy, start with 6\u20138 fluid ounces (180\u2013240 mL). Instead of buying multiple small bottles, pick up one big bottle and use as much as you think is necessary. Only use plain white or clear PVA glue, like the kind used for school projects. No other type of glue will work for making thick slime."

          "description":"Measure out the water and pour it directly on top of the glue in your mixing bowl. You need to use a 1:1 ratio of water to glue to make sure that your slime comes out with the right texture. If you used an entire bottle of glue, an easy way to ensure that you\u2019re getting the right amount of water is to refill the bottle under the faucet, shake it up, then add it to the glue. Make sure you add just the right amount of water. Too little moisture could cause your finished slime to turn out dry and cakey, while too much could make it thinner than you\u2019d like."

Green, blue, purple, pink, and yellow are all good colors for gooey, rubbery slime. This is also the best time to mix in glitter, plastic stars, miniature styrofoam balls, hand lotion, or any other additives you wish to incorporate. Use only about \u00bc-\u00bd cup (75-150 g) of each to avoid throwing off the texture of your slime.
