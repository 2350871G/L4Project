          "description":"Cleaning an electric smoker is much easier when it has just been used. Any debris and buildup will be warm and easier to remove than debris and buildup that has been hardening in an unused unit. If you haven't used your smoker in a while, you can also heat it to its maximum temperature for about one hour, and then let it cool down. Though electric smoker models vary, the maximum temperature for your average model is 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C). Once your smoker cools down, you should be able to touch all the surfaces and components inside without any pain or discomfort to your hands."

Depending on the size of your smoker, your drip tray, water pan and racks might be small enough to place in the dishwasher."

Brush the debris into a small pile at the edge of the smoker's floor, and then brush it onto the tarp. You want to scrape the inside of your smoker gently. The point of cleaning your smoker is to remove the big chunks of debris only. Be sure to clean the far corners inside the smoking chamber as they often get overlooked."

Remember, the walls of your smoker get darker with each use, so avoid trying to scrub them clean. The darkening, called seasoning, prevents rust and makes your smoker work better."
