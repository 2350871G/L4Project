Soaking the seeds breaks down some of the hard coating, speeding up the germination process. You can also try soaking the pepper seeds in weak chamomile tea or a solution made with 1 cup (250 ml) warm water and 1 or 2 teaspoons (5 or 10 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide. These solutions are even more effective at breaking down the coating and have the added benefit of disinfecting the seeds."
