Alex Hong\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Because it's so lean, veal can be challenging to cook. It's very similar to pork, in that sometimes you'll touch it and it will feel perfect, but you'll cut into it and it's a little undercooked. Take the time to check the temperature, and you'll see a better result."
