Stop when you can\u2019t peel any more off.Warning: If you try to repair faux leather without pulling off all the loose bits, it will just continue to peel away after the repair. You can use a blunt-edged object, such as a butter knife, to help you peel up and scrape away the loose bits of faux leather if it is difficult to do with just your fingers. This method works for all types of faux leather items that are peeling or cracking including furniture, clothing, and accessories.

    "Pour some of the kit\u2019s cleaning solution onto a soft, clean cloth.",

    "If the tear is very tiny, like a thin slit from a knife, you don\u2019t necessarily have to use the patch.",
    "You can skip to the next step and try glueing down the surrounding faux leather to seal up the tear.",
    "Glue the edges of the surrounding faux leather down to the patch.",
    "Apply another thin bead of the provided adhesive underneath the edges of faux leather around the patched tear.",
    "Press the edges down firmly and smoothly so that they stick around the patch.",
