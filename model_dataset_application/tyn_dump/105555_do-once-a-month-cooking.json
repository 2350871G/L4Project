If you have a family of 2, you'll need 2 servings per day for each day of the week, so each recipe should make at least 14 servings. You can definitely plan beyond 4 dishes. Base the number of dishes on your capabilities and freezer space. You may want to take a peek into your pantry to see what ingredients you already have on hand before choosing your dishes, especially if you\u2019re trying to save money.
