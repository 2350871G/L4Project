You can use just about any type of fabric for this project. It should be about three times the height and width of your pillow. Place your pillow on top of the fabric. Lay the fabric down, wrong side up, on a flat surface. Set your pillow on top of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered. Fold the top and bottom edges of the fabric over the pillow. Fold the top edge of the fabric over the pillow and smooth it down. Repeat with the bottom edge. Make sure that the fabric to either side of the pillow is smooth. Fold the left side of the fabric into a point. Smooth the fabric to the left side of the pillow down first. Fold the top edge down at an angle towards the center, then fold the bottom edge up to meet it. When you are done, you should have a \"<\" shape. Fold the right side of the fabric to a point. Do the same thing you just did for the left side. Fold the top edge down at an angle, then the bottom edge. When you are done, you should have a \">\" shape.

Tie the ends of the fabric into a square knot. A square knot is essentially a double-knot. Use the same knot as when starting to tie your shoes. Instead of doing the same knot twice, you reverse them: right-over-left, then left-over-right. Keep the fabric folded into points. Tuck the ends of the fabrics under the knot. If you need to, tuck then inside the knot for extra security. Making a Knotted Fleece Pillow Cut two pieces of fleece larger than your pillow. Measure your pillow first, then add 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) to each side. This will create a nice, snug pillowcase. You can use matching pieces of fleece, or contrasting ones. You can even use a solid color for one piece, and a pattern for the other. Stack the two pieces of fleece together. Make sure that the right sides are facing out.

Holding them together, wrap them to form a loop, then push the ends through the loop. Slide the knot towards the top. You can also make a simple double-knot instead. Repeat the process for the bottom and side edges. Do not knot the strips along the top edge of the pillowcase just yet. Insert the pillow. The fit will be a little snug, but the fleece should stretch over the pillow. It will be very \"puffy.\" Knot the strips along the top edge of the pillow case. This will close the pillow, and hold everything together. Your knotted pillow is now complete!",
