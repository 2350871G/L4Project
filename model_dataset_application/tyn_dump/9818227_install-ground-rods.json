Most home improvement and hardware stores stock approved grounding rods. In the US, ground rods need to be at least 8 feet (2.4 m) long. If they are listed, they need to be at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide and they will have a mark that says they are listed. If they are not listed, they need to be at least \u20448 inch (1.6 cm) wide. A listed ground rod will have a marking near the top of it that states that it is approved. The mark allows an electrical inspector to immediately know you have used a proper rod."

To get the top down to a more manageable level, dig a hole 2\u20134 feet (0.61\u20131.22 m) deep. By putting the end of the ground rod in the hole, it will be easier to start hammering the top of the rod. If you don't want to dig a hole or you can't for some reason, you will need a ladder or step stool to get up high enough to start pounding in the top of the ground rod."

The electrical code states that it must have 8 feet (2.4 m) of contact with the ground, so you need to drive it all the way down. Driving a ground rod into the ground can take a long time and can be difficult work. If you can find someone to take turns driving the rod, it will make for a much easier job. Some electrical inspectors will allow you to leave 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) sticking up out of the ground. However, some want the entire thing covered in earth."
