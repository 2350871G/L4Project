          "description":"Take a lap around your house, focusing specifically on the siding and foundation. Check to see if there are any obvious holes or chips in the structure. If you see any openings larger than the size of a coin, cover them with metal screening. If you secure all possible entrance points for bees, they won\u2019t be able to enter your home. If a nest has already formed, don\u2019t screen away the area. Instead, contact your local beekeeper to see if there\u2019s a way to safely relocate the insects. Did you know? Different bees like to hover around different areas of your yard. Bumblebees are about 0.5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) in length, and they prefer to nest in dry, secure spots. Carpenter bees are similar in size and shape to bumblebees, but this species prefers to burrow in trees and other wooden structures. Honeybees are smaller than bumblebees and carpenter bees, and tend to hover over crops and flowers."
