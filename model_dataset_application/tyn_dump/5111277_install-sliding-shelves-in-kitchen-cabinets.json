  "text":" Ordering Shelving Measure the width and depth of the cabinet in which you would like to place sliding shelves.  Compare those measurements to pre-made sliding shelves available online, at home improvement stores or through cabinet companies.  Order the sliding shelves that fit your cabinets. If you want to do several layers of shelves, it is best to start with bottom sliding shelves and move to the middle or top only when you know you will have space for several racks. Remove the shelves from the packaging. Check them to ensure they were not damaged. Lay the drawer, base mount screws and brackets on the kitchen floor by the cabinet.  Remove the contents of the kitchen cabinet.  Compare the mounting screws with your drill bits. Insert and lock in a Philips head or other drill bit that will fit into the screw heads. Aligning the Brackets Pick up the drawer slides. Check to see if they have brackets already attached to them. The brackets are the point at which you will screw the sliding shelf into the cabinet. Turn the pull out drawer so that the front is facing the ground. Check the correct sides for the drawer slides by sliding them onto either side of the pull out drawer. Place the drawer with slides into the kitchen cabinet to be sure it is the correct size. Align the drawer with the cabinet itself. Check the front, back and sides to ensure it\u2019s straight and square with the opening. Close the door of the cabinet. Adjust the brackets, slides and shelf inside the cabinet if the door doesn\u2019t close. Installing the Shelves Pull the drawer forward. Expose the brackets in the back. Make sure the brackets are flush with the bottom surface and facing down. Screw the brackets down using a mounting screw and your drill. Use one of the circular or oblong screw holes closest to the drawer slide. Pull the drawer all the way forward. If possible, pull it all the way out to gain access to the front brackets. Screw the front brackets down with mounting screws and your power drill. Also, choose the holes closest to the drawer slide. Test the drawer again. If it is in the right place, screw a mounting screw into the center of each bracket. If it is not, remove the screws with the drill and reposition the brackets and drawer. Insert the drawer. Begin loading it and testing it again. It will be ready to hold dishes or supplies.",
