Wait 1 to 3 minutes and fill a sample cell with some untested pool water. Once the time is up, fill another sample cell with some of the tested pool water. You'll now be able to compare the results to an untested sample. Use the chart that came with the test kit to determine the cyanuric acid level in your pool. If you don't want to test the water yourself, fill a container with water and take it to your local pool supply store where they can test it for you.
