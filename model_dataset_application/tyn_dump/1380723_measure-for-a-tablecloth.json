A larger tablecloth will simply hang lower, while a smaller one may not cover the entire table. Also, as with any fabric, tablecloths may shrink when washed, potentially becoming up to 4 inches (10cm) smaller over time. You may also consider alternative options, such as a rectangular \"runner\" cloth that runs across the center of a rectangular table without covering the full width."

For most tablecloths, you can simply estimate where the center is by eye. If you want to be more exact, you may measure starting at several positions and calculate the average of your results. The more exact method is recommended if you want a tablecloth that sits entirely on top of the table, with 0 to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of overhang.

For more formal occasions or tables that do not have chairs stored under them, you may choose to have a drop length extending all the way to the ground.
