          "description":"Avoid acrylic or oil-based paints because these will leave your carpet feeling crunchy and clumpy. While you could use a paintbrush to apply canned upholstery paint, you won\u2019t achieve the same coverage consistency as you would using spray paint. Choose a color that complements the walls or furniture in the room. For example, use blue spray paint to complement light brown walls or opt for a classic maroon paint to provide contrast for blue, black, or white walls and furniture. Note that using a light-colored paint on a dark carpet won\u2019t give you the intended result. For instance, white paint on a black carpet might turn out looking gray. Bright, vivid colors work best on white carpets. If your carpet is tan or taupe with yellow undertones and you\u2019re using a light-colored paint, those yellow undertones will come through and give you a different result than on the can. You may have to do several coats to achieve the color closest to the can, so buy extra cans if that\u2019s the case. Existing patterns on the carpet may still show if they\u2019re a darker color than the paint you\u2019re using. If that\u2019s the case, be prepared to do extra coats, accept the design shadows showing through, or cover them with furniture."

    "Use a measuring tape to measure out where you want the border lines to go, then make small tick marks with a light-colored washable marker.",
    "Lay the tape according to the tick marks.",
    "The areas covered by tape will reveal the current color of the carpet.",
    "Hold up a piece of cardboard at a 45-degree angle next to the tape line to protect the inside section of the carpet from the paint.",
    "Use a rag to remove any puddled paint on the tape or stencils.",
    "Blot the painter\u2019s tape or stencil with a rag to soak up any puddles of paint that may have collected on them.",
    "That way, when you peel away the tape or lift the stencil, the puddle won\u2019t drip onto the carpet and ruin your design.",
    "Pull up the tape or remove the stencil only after you\u2019re finished painting that area.",
    "Allow the paint to dry before adding a new color or more tape for the design.",
    "Touch the painted area with your finger to make sure it\u2019s dry before moving on with a new color or before laying down more painter\u2019s tape.",
    "If your design requires adding more tape to previously painted areas, wait until those areas are completely dry.",
    "For instance, if you spray red spray paint over blue paint that isn\u2019t dry, you could end up with purple areas.",
    "Placing tape onto still-damp painted areas will compromise the consistency of the paint and, as a result, mess up your design.",
    "Use paint thinner to clean up your design or erase mistakes.",
    "Use a paper towel to wipe up as much of the excess paint as possible, then douse a cloth with paint thinner and blot or rub the affected area until you don\u2019t see any traces of color.",
    "Mineral spirits or acetone can also be used to remove paint.",
    "Wait 8 to 10 hours until the rug is completely dry before walking on it.",
    "Avoid stepping on the painted areas of the carpet for the next 8 to 10 hours or until it\u2019s completely dry.",
    "Depending on the climate and humidity of the area you live in, this could take up to 12 or even 24 hours."
