If the tag tells you to wash your garment in cool water, you can wash it in warm water to shrink it. For example, cotton easily shrinks, as does cotton and polyester blends. Synthetic fabric like rayon and nylon do not shrink."

          "description":"To do this, put your sweatshirt in a clean sink, and run hot water over the garment for 5-10 minutes. Let the sweatshirt cool down to room temperature, and then check the sizing. If you are satisfied with the amount your sweatshirt shrinks, you can launder it as normal. If you want to shrink your sweatshirt even more, use boiling water, your washing machine, and/or your dryer. To check the size, hold the shirt up to your torso and examine it in the mirror."

          "headline":"Submerge your cotton sweatshirt in boiling water to shrink the fabric.",
          "description":"If your sweatshirt did not shrink enough after using hot water, boil a large pot of water on high heat. When your water comes to a boil, submerge your garments, put a lid on the pot, and turn off the heat. The boiling water helps shrink your shirt even more. If you want to shrink your shirt 1 size, leave it in the water for 10-15 minutes. If you hope to shrink your shirt 2 sizes, let it cool to room temperature. Do not do this if washing a polyester sweatshirt. The high temperatures can make the fabric rough or stiff. Polyester should not be heated above 178 \u00b0F (81 \u00b0C). Alternatively, put your sweatshirt in your sink and pour boiling water over top the garment. Then, let it cool to room temperature."

You can wash your sweatshirt with other garments you want to shrink, such as T-shirts. Select the appropriate load size, and pour in 1 cap full of laundry detergent. After you wash your sweatshirt, check the sizing before you put it in the dryer. To maximize your shrinkage, use the longest washing size. If you just want to shrink it 1 size, you can use a normal wash cycle. If you are washing a small load of laundry, you only need one half of a cap of detergent. When checking the size, hold the wet sweatshirt in front of your torso and eyeball the size in the mirror. Once the sweatshirt is dry, you can try it on to check the fit."
