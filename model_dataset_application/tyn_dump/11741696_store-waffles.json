Any waffles left out for more than 2 hours could have unsafe bacteria on it, so throw them out instead.Bacteria spreads on any food under 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). Quick storage prevents bacteria from forming, keeping your waffles safe for another day. If the temperature is above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C), the waffles will become unsafe to eat after 1 hour, so be sure to store them before then!"
