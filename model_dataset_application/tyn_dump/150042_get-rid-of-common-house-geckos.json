Targeting Geckos' Food Sources Discourage mosquitos, gnats, and flies. These pests love stagnant water because they thrive in it. You should remove or cover any objects or areas that offer this amenity. Cover your garbage cans and recyclables container. Don\u2019t leave glasses of water lying around for long periods of time.

Ants are repelled by the smell of vinegar, so spray or flick some white vinegar around your window and door frames to keep them from marching in. Also, try to clean up after you eat: soiled napkins, crumbs, and unwashed dishes are alluring to ants. Eradicate fruit flies. Fruit flies love sweet things, they can\u2019t help themselves.
