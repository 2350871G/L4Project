  "text":" Obtain about a quarter yard (22.8cm) of closely woven fabric. Cotton and felts work best, but you can make this from nearly any material once you get the hang of it. Cut 36 football shapes (American football, not soccer!) from your fabric. The shapes should be approximately 2 inches (5cm) long and one inch (2.5cm) wide. Important: Make all of the football shapes exactly the same size, and allow an extra 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) for the seams. 12 shapes from each of three different colors works very nicely for this project. With \"right sides\", or patterned side, of the fabric together, stitch two pieces together along one edge. If sewing by hand, take care to make your stitches very small and even to prevent problems later. Note: Begin and end the seam a seam allowance width from the point to prevent bunching when sewing and turning. Fold the current pair open as shown.  Place the third piece over the opening, with edges aligned. With right sides facing, sew one long edge together. Unfold the remaining edge and sew half a side of it to the third piece (leaving an opening for stuffing). This will create a three sided wedge which resembles a (somewhat fat) orange section. If using three fabrics, use one fabric per side of your wedges so that you can \"change colors\" on the ball later. Sew all 12 wedges in a similar manner.  Clip the points of the wedges away before turning to prevent bunching.  Turn the seams to the middle and the \"right\" or patterned side out.  Stuff firmly with batting and stitch closed carefully.  Attach the wedges to each other by their end points.  Form a triangle from each group of three wedges by sewing their points together end to end.  Join each wedge triangle to another group at the points, forming a cross or \"X\" shape.  When all points are sewn together, the wedges will resemble a ball in shape.
