    "Use drinking stations early in the summer for best results.",
    "Keep adding fresh water every 1 to 2 days to attract more wasps, and repeat the whole process every 3 to 5 days.",
    "Getting Rid of Nests Hang a fake nest within 200 feet (61 m) of each new nest.",
    "Early on in the summer, you might be able to chase wasps away at their first appearance by hanging a fake nest around your home or around any area you want wasps to stay away from.",
    "However, this solution isn't always effective and doesn't work late in the summer.",
    "Purchase fake wasp nests from big-box stores and online suppliers.",
    "You can also use a paper lantern or brown paper bag.",
    "Knock the nest down after applying insecticide or early in the season.",
    "If you have applied insecticide or the season is early and the nest is still small, consider knocking the it down with a broom, rake, or other long-handled tools.",
    "When the wasps are alive, you must knock the nest down on a regular basis to discourage the wasps.",
    "Expect to knock the nest down several times before the wasps give up and find somewhere else to build.",
    "If you have applied in insecticide and most of the wasps are dead, saturate it with insecticide spray after knocking it down and then break it apart.",
    "Drown underground nests with boiling water at night.",
    "Keep an eye on wasp behavior for 2 to 3 days and find the most frequented nest entrances and exits.",
    "Afterward, head over to these spots at night when the wasps are asleep and pour a pot of boiling water down.",
    "Stuff some soil into the holes after you have flooded the hive (unless the wasps begin to ascend from the nest).Always wear protection and be careful\u2014this method can trigger a mass attack.",
    "Capture and seal the nest in the fall.",
    "Wait until the coolest time of night and approach the nest as quietly as possible.",
    "Quickly slip a plastic bag over the nest while continuing to make as little noise as possible.",
    "Afterward, close the bag around the limb directly above the nest, tie the bag shut, and then cut or break the limb from the tree.",
    "Place the nest into the freezer for about a day or into a bucket of water to drown the wasps.",
    "Only attempt to capture wasps in late October or after the first hard freeze, which is at least 4 hours in a row of air temperatures lower than 25 \u00b0F (\u22124 \u00b0C).",
    "Make sure the plastic has an airtight seal."
