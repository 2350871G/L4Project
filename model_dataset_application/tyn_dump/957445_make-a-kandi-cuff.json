Wrap the string around your wrist to get a general measurement, and then multiply this length 5-6 times over. Cut the string  at this length; if you run out of string during the beading process, you can always cut and tie on a bit more."

Add another bead, and slide the string through the bead next/under it on the first row.

Slide a bead onto the string where there is a gap, and then attach it to the cuff by putting the string through the corresponding bead in the first row.
