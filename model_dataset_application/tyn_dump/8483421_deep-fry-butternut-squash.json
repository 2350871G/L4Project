          "description":"When choosing an oil to deep fry your butternut squash in, it\u2019s important to pick one that has a higher smoke point than the cooking temperature. For example, if you have a food that needs to be cooked at 350 degrees F (176 C), then use an oil that doesn\u2019t smoke until 375-400 degrees F (190-204 C). Oils like sunflower, soybean, and peanut are the best for frying at high temperatures. You can also use vegetable shortening or lard. However, avoid olive oil and butter as they have low smoking points and burn easily."

          "description":"If you don\u2019t have a deep fryer, use a large pot with high walls. Ideally, there should be ten centimeters to four inches of space between the oil and the top of the pot. However, you want to make sure that you have enough oil to submerge your food, so use your best judgment. For deep fryers, simply fill the fryer up to the oil line with the oil of your choice. When working without a deep fryer, try filling the pot only halfway. This will help prevent spillover and splattering. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F (175 C). You can use a candy thermometer or other kitchen thermometer that hooks onto the pot to monitor the temperature."

Try cutting it vertically into one inch strips for fries or into small, thin rounds for chips. You can even shred or mash the squash to mix with flour and egg for butternut squash fritters."

For example, if you are making butternut squash fries, try putting the cut up slices into a plastic bag with a tablespoon or two of cornstarch and shaking it. You can also add a bit of paprika and garlic salt for a kick. If you are making fritters, try mixing flour, baking powder, and salt with milk, maple syrup, and an egg.

Try not to drop the pieces in as this can cause splash back that is dangerous. You should also only deep fry a small batch at a time, as overcrowding the fryer can cause the butternut squash to stick together. If you notice pieces beginning to clump together, lightly separate them with your tongs or spoon."

This should take anywhere between two to eight minutes."
