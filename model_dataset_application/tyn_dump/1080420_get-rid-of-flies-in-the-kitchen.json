  "text":" Preventing Common Flies in the Kitchen Eliminate the obvious sources of attraction for fruit flies. Place ripened fruit and vegetables out of sight and into the refrigerator to prevent fruit flies from having a breeding source. Throw any rotten produce away. Empty recycling bins and trash cans regularly to avoid fruit flies and houseflies. Clean the sides and bottom of the garbage can and bin so that they are free of food and juices on their surfaces. Avoid getting potential spills from cans and bottles on your trash cans and recycle bins by cleaning them out before they are thrown away. For spills and regular cleaning, spray trash can and recycling bin surfaces with an all-purpose cleaner and wipe it dry with a paper towel.

Spray drains with Insect Growth Regulator to prevent future infestation by halting the growth process of fly eggs living in the drain. Using Fly Traps Place a funnel trap in your kitchen to trap fruit flies. Heat half a cup of apple cider vinegar and pour it into a wine bottle or jar. With a sheet of paper, form a cone-shaped funnel with tape and stick it to the jar. Although fruit flies do not tend to be clever enough to leave the funnel jar once they\u2019ve entered, adding a drop or two of dish soap can help prevent flies from being able to fly away once they\u2019ve entered the jar.

If you feel like the wine hasn\u2019t done the job, fill the bottle with a dash of dish soap and water or place the bottle in the freezer to eliminate the flies and any potential eggs. Get rid of drain flies by pouring bleach, vinegar, or boiling water down an infested drain. This will kill existing flies, but because it does not remove eggs or organic slime, it is recommended that you follow up with a bacterial drain cleaner. Pour drain gel into the drain to remove organic slime and drain fly infestations. Repeat this action five consecutive nights to get rid of everything that\u2019s down there.

Keep the drain flies at bay by using a drain gel one night a week. Fill a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol to kill common flies in the kitchen. Use the spray to instantly kill flies that hover around in the infested areas around the kitchen. Repelling Kitchen Flies Use a vodka based repellent to kill houseflies and fruit flies. Mix vodka, aloe vera juice, lemon eucalyptus oil, and an essential oil blend into a spray bottle. It can be applied to your skin or sprayed near infested areas to ward off flies. Make a lemongrass spray repellent for fruit flies and houseflies. In a spray bottle of a \u00bd cup of hot water, add 20 drops of lemongrass essential oil. Shake well. It does not kill flies, but it does repel them. Spray the mixture on windowsills, doorways, and other problem areas you see fit around your kitchen.
