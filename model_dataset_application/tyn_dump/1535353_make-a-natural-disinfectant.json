          "description":"In a standard-sized glass spray bottle, add 1 part water, 1 part vinegar and 5-15 drops of 100% essential oil. You can use whichever essential oil whose scent you prefer, or customize the scent according to what room in your home you are cleaning. Lemon essential oil is traditionally used to clean the kitchen, as the lemon scent can neutralize strong kitchen smells. Tea tree and eucalyptus oil are great for neutralizing bathroom odors. You may prefer to use milder smelling essential oils such as chamomile or vanilla in the parts of your houses where you are not worried about eliminating odors. Essential oils can sometimes react with plastic, which is why you should use a glass spray bottle."
