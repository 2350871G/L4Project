Don't blow your balloon up too small, or it will look more like an egg (although this will work great for a balloon gourd! ). Cut your yarn into 36-inch (91.44-centimeter) long pieces.

Hot glue the leaves to the vines, then attach the vines to the base of the stem. Making a Pompom Pumpkin Wrap some orange yarn around your hand about 120 times. Hold your hand out flat with your fingers together. Wrap the yarn around your fingers about 120 times. Be sure to wrap loosely so has not to cut off blood circulation. Choose plain, medium or worsted-weight yarn for this. Cut a piece of orange yarn, and wrap it around the middle of your yarn bundle. Start by cutting a piece of your orange yarn that is around 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) long. Thread it below the yarn bundle, between your middle and ring finger. Pull the yarn bundle off your hand. Try to keep the short piece of yarn in position. Tie the short piece of yarn around the yarn bundle tightly. Bring the two ends of the short piece of yarn together, and tie them into a tight knot. Flip the bundle over, and wrap the yarn to the back. Tie the yarn into a tight, double knot. Even though this is just like making a pompom, do not cut the yarn bundle apart. Tie a 2-inch (5.08-centier) piece of green or brown pipe cleaner to the center of your pumpkin. Cut a green or brown pipe cleaner down to 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) and place it on top of your knotted yarn. Tie the ends of the yarn over the pipe cleaner in another double knot. Twist the pipe cleaner together to make the stem. Fold the pipe cleaner in half, then twist the ends together to make a thick stem. If you'd like, you can curl the end of the stem over your finger, pen, or pencil. To great vines: wrap a green pipe cleaner around a skewer or pencil, pull it off, then gently pull it apart to create a spring. Wrap it around the base of the stem. Fluff up your pumpkin and neaten it up. Once again, do not cut the loops of yarn apart. Instead, manipulate them with your fingers so that they are evenly spread around the stem, creating a squashed, pumpkin-like shape. At this point, you can cut the loose ends of the short piece of yarn off. Alternatively, you can tie them to a long piece of twine to make a garland. Making a Wrapped Pumpkin Find a small, plastic pumpkin to use as your base. If you can't find one, you can use a Styrofoam ball instead, then do the following:\nUse a saw or serrated knife to cut the bottom off of the ball so that it will sit flat and not roll around. Use a knife or a pair of scissors to drill a hole in the top of the ball for the stem. Fill the hole with some hot glue, then insert a short wooden stick; you can also use a cork. Secure the end of your yarn to the base of your pumpkin with a drop of hot glue.
