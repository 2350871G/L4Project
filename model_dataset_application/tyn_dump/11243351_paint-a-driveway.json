Remove any other objects, such as planters or anything else you have on the driveway, and set them off to the side where you can leave them for at least 3 days.Tip: Check the forecast and make sure that there is no rain in the forecast for at least 3-4 days so you will have enough time to apply 2 coats and let them dry. For the best results, paint your driveway when temperatures remain above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) during both the day and night. You will be able to walk on the driveway after 24 hours and you can place things back onto it after 72 hours.

Pressure washers can cause serious injury if aimed at people or damage things like paint if you spray the side of your home. If you don\u2019t have a pressure washer you can usually rent one at a hardware store or home improvement center.
