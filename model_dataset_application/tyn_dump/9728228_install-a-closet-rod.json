Every closet varies, so it's important to measure the width of your specific closet with a tape measure so you can purchase the correct length. Make sure you measure the width of the closet in the area where the rod will be installed. The width of another area, such as the bottom of the closet, could vary dramatically from the upper part of the closet where the rod will be located."

You will also have the option of getting a solid bar or one that is adjustable. Many home improvement stores also stock closet bar kits. These kits include all of the parts you will need to put up your bar: the bar, sockets, and anchors. Whatever type of closet rod you choose, make sure it is the right length. Solid rods can be cut to length, but there are also many adjustable rods that can work in a variety of closets."

These sockets come in a wide variety of styles and are usually made of either metal or wood. If you choose a metal socket, you can typically also choose from several finishes, including silver and white. Some rod sockets are attached to shelf brackets. These can be used to hold the rod and to put a shelf above the rod area."

Many sockets come with screws, but if yours don't, you will need to purchase some separately. You will also need a few tools to attach the clothes bar. These include a drill, a screwdriver, and a saw for adjusting the length of the bar and cutting structural support pieces. Typically, you will need at least 3 wood screws that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long for each socket."

          "description":"In order to make the closet rod truly helpful, put it at a height that makes it accessible and useful. In general, it's a good idea to mount a single rod at 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. A double rod set up should have the bottom rod mounted at 3.5 feet (1.1 m) and the upper rod mounted at 7 feet (2.1 m). If there is a shelf above the rod, you should make sure the rod is at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the shelf. To figure out how high to put your clothes bar, first think about what you will use it for. For example, if you want to hang long dresses off of a bar, you need to hang it pretty high. If you simply want to hang shirts off of the bar, you can put it at a more moderate height."

          "headline":"Decide how deep you want the bar to be.",
          "description":"It's important to have it back far enough so that the hangers and clothes that are on the bar will clear the door. However, you also need enough room behind the closet rod for the hangers to clear the back wall. In most cases, having the bar 10 inches (25 cm) off of the back wall works well. To ensure that the rod is positioned correctly, hold a hanger up on the inside of the closet so the hook is at the height you want the rod to go. Position the hanger so it is fully inside the closet and even has a few inches of clearance from the door. Then make a mark at the center of the hanger hook on the wall of the closet. This will give you your proper depth. If you have a particularly deep closet, you can put your bar even deeper."

          "headline":"Mark both sides of the closet.",
          "description":"Once you have figured out the ideal height and depth for your bar, mark where the brackets will go on both sides of the closet. Measuring up from the floor with a tape measure, make a small preliminary mark at the correct height and approximately the right depth on one side of the closet. Then pull the measuring tape up and check the depth of your mark. Adjust your mark so that it continues to be at the correct height and is now at the right depth as well. Repeat this process on the other side of the closet as well. To check your work, measure from the ground, the ceiling, the front, and the back of the closet on both sides. Your marks should be at the same point on both sides."

          "description":"Closet bars need to be able to support a large amount of weight. To make sure they don't fall because of this weight, it is important to screw them into studs in the wall. The easiest way to find studs in a wall is to use a stud finder. You can also run a strong magnet along the wall to look for screws or nails that are in studs. Look at the top and bottom trim on the wall. They are likely nailed into the studs, so if you can see nail heads, you can identify where the studs are."

This is done by attaching 1 by 5 inches (2.5 cm \u00d7 12.7 cm) pieces of wood along the wall that the sockets can then be attached to. To put up structural support, measure the depth of the side walls of the closet. Cut two pieces of wood that are 1 by 5 inches (2.5 cm \u00d7 12.7 cm) to that depth. Then screw them into the studs on the side walls, making sure that their center point is the height you want your clothes bar to be at.
