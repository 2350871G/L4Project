  "text":" Setting up Your Level Find a benchmark location near the spot you want to measure. A benchmark location is a spot that you already know the height of thanks to previous land surveys. In order to get the most accurate data out of your dumpy level, you\u2019ll need to search online and find a benchmark location located close to the spot you want to measure. You can look up benchmark locations by visiting sites like https://www.geocaching.com/mark/. If you can\u2019t find a benchmark location, you can measure from a distinct land feature, such as a large tree or building, instead. Set your tripod up near the spot you want to measure. Place your tripod on a patch of flat, clear ground that sits between your benchmark location and the spot you want to measure.

Once the instrument is securely attached, turn the dumpy level\u2019s telescope so that it sits parallel with 2 of the device\u2019s leveling screws. If the dumpy level wobbles when tapped, tighten the leveling screws to better secure the device. Level the device by adjusting the 2 leveling screws. Look for a traditional bubble level located somewhere on your device.

For the best results, turn the screws with an even amount of force and pressure. You\u2019ll typically find the bubble level either on top of or below the device\u2019s telescope. Turn your telescope 90 degrees and adjust the third leveling screw. After adjusting your first 2 leveling screws, turn your telescope approximately 90 degrees so that it sits parallel to the device\u2019s third leveling screw. Then, adjust this screw until the bubble once again sits in the center of the level. Vintage dumpy levels often have 4 leveling screws instead of 3.

If you\u2019re having trouble focusing, ask a friend or colleague to hold an E staff near the benchmark spot. This metered measuring stick will give you an easy object to focus on. Taking a Measurement Position an E staff on top of your benchmark spot. If necessary, purchase an E staff online or from a survey equipment shop. Then, have a friend or colleague hold the staff on top of your benchmark spot. For the most accurate measurements, have your friend rock the staff forwards and backwards and record the lowest number you read. Most E staffs collapse to save space, so make sure you extend your staff before taking any measurements. Use a fiberglass staff instead of a metal version if you\u2019re taking measurements in an area beneath power lines. Find the height difference between your level and the benchmark spot. Look through your dumpy level\u2019s telescope and locate the E staff. Then, record the measurement indicated by your device\u2019s center, horizontal crosshair. This measurement is known as your backsight. Each numbered section of your staff represents 10 cm (3.9 in). Within these sections, every block indicates 1 cm (0.39 in) and every E indicates 5 cm (2.0 in). Calculate your level\u2019s actual height using the benchmark height. Once you have your backsight measurement, add it to your benchmark location's actual height. This will give you the current height of your dumpy level\u2019s telescope. Record this measurement so you can use it to find the height of your next spot. Find the height difference between your level and the unmeasured spot. Move your E staff so it sits directly on top of the spot you want to measure. Use your device\u2019s telescope to find the staff, then record whatever number the device\u2019s center, horizontal cross hair sits over. This measurement is known as your foresight. If necessary, adjust your eyepiece\u2019s focusing knob until you can see the staff. If the spot is too high or far away for you to measure, move your staff to a lower, closer spot first.
