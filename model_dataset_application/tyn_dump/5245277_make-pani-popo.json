          "description":"Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the yeast is dissolved and the mixture is frothy. The water should be between 105 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (40 and 46 degrees Celsius) for best results. If you plan on using a standing mixer, combine the two ingredients in the bowl of the mixer."

The ingredients may not be melted when you remove the dish from the microwave, but adequate stirring should be enough to melt them down afterward."
        },

          "headline":"Whisk in the egg and powdered milk.",
          "description":"Add the two ingredients to the coconut milk mixture and whisk lightly to combine evenly. You may want to let the mixture cool slightly before adding the egg. If you add the egg while the mixture is steaming hot, it could curdle. The other option is to temper the egg by beating it in a separate dish and adding a small amount of the hot coconut mixture. Stir the two together until evenly combined, slowly bringing the temperature of the egg up in the process. Add this tempered egg into the rest of the mixture and whisk to combine."

          "description":"Sprinkle the flour into the liquid ingredients. Continue mixing the dough on medium speed for another 2 minutes, or until all of the ingredients have combined evenly into a dough. The ingredients need to form a soft, sticky dough. If the dough does not hold together, you may need to add up to another 1/4 cup (60 ml) of flour."

          "description":"Dump the dough out of the bowl and onto a clean, lightly floured counter or table. Knead the dough for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. This step incorporates more air into the dough, so you'll have airy bread if you complete it. If you prefer dense bread, however, skip or shorten the knead time. You can add a little flour to the dough as you knead it, but try to avoid adding too much. This dough must remain sticky and soft. If the dough becomes tough, the rolls will become tough, too."

Spray the bowl with a little nonstick cooking spray before placing the dough inside. After placing the dough inside, it's also a good idea to turn it once so that all sides are coated in the cooking spray. This reduces the surface stickiness of the dough. For best results, let the dough rise in a spot that is both warm and draft-free."

The simplest way to form dough balls is to simply pinch the dough off in chunks and roll them into shape. Another option would be to roll the entire portion of dough into a long cylinder. Use a knife to slice that cylinder into evenly sized 1-inch (2.5-cm) rounds."

          "description":"Before you measure out the coconut milk, give the can or container a thorough stir. Coconut milk has a tendency to coagulate. When you are working with an unopened can, you can usually smooth it out by shaking the can. When working with an opened can, you'll need to stir the contents to combine them again."

Note that the mixture may seem overly sweet at this point if you taste it now. As it bakes, though, much of the sweetness will be absorbed by the buns, making the sauce itself a little less sugary.

If you prefer crispier buns and less sauce, you can brush a little of the sauce on the tops and sides of each roll with a pastry brush instead of pouring the entire batch of sauce on top.

If the sauce itself does not overwhelm you when you taste the finished product, you can add this final dusting of sugar the next time you prepare the dish."

    "Depending on how long it takes your oven to preheat, you may want to do this shortly before the rolls have finished rising.",
    "Combine the remaining three ingredients.",
    "Add the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and white sugar to a small mixing bowl.",
    "Whisk the ingredients together into a smooth, even sauce.",
    "This sauce will be quite sweet.",
    "If you would prefer a milder sauce, decrease the amount of sugar down to 2 or 3 Tbsp (30 or 45 ml).",
    "Pour the coconut milk mixture over the rolls.",
    "Once the rolls have finished rising, evenly pour the coconut sauce over the tops and sides of the dough.",
    "The sauce should cling to the surface of each roll, but most of it will sink down to the bottom of the pan.",
    "Bake for 30 minutes.",
    "Place the rolls in your preheated oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they turn golden brown in color.",
    "Cool and enjoy.",
    "Remove the finished pani popo from the oven.",
    "Let the rolls cool for a few minutes, then enjoy them while they are still warm and fresh.",
    "Scoop the individual rolls directly out of the pan and onto serving plates.",
    "Spoon any extra sauce from the bottom of the pan over the top of each roll before enjoying.",
    "Alternatively, invert the pan onto a large serving platter and serve the rolls upside-down (sauce-side up)."
