    "Remove the thermometer and put the lid on the pot.",
    "Check the temperature after 60 minutes to ensure it\u2019s remaining around the 88 \u00b0F (31 \u00b0C) range.",
    "Make sure to set a timer so the mixture doesn\u2019t simmer for too long.",
    "Measure the rennet and add it to the pot.",
    "Use 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of liquid rennet mixed with \u20444 cup (59 mL) of water, and carefully add it to the rest of the liquid.",
    "Stir the pot for 1 minute to help it mix in.",
    "Rennet contains all the enzymes that curdle milk.",
    "Lower the heat so it maintains a temperature of 88 \u00b0F (31 \u00b0C).",
    "Turn down the burner and check the thermometer until the temperature reaches the right degree.",
    "The temperature component of blue cheese is really important to getting it to the right consistency.",
    "If you\u2019re having a hard time getting the right temperature on the stove top, you could fill the sink with hot water and submerge the pot in there for a more gentle heating process.",
    "You may need to add more hot water every so often to keep the temperature at the right level.",
    "Let the liquid simmer and coagulate for about 90 minutes.",
    "Put the lid back onto the pot, removing the thermometer if you need to.",
    "Set a timer for 90 minutes.",
    "When you check the pot once the time is up, the mixture should break into chunks when you push it.",
    "If the consistency is more like yogurt, let it sit for an extra 15 minutes.",
    "The top of the pan will be filled with the coagulated milk, and beneath it will be the whey, which is the remaining liquid.",
    "Cutting and Straining the Curd Cut a checkerboard pattern in the curd to break it up into chunks.",
    "Take your knife and make long, even cuts across the curd.",
    "Then do the same going the opposite direction, to create a grid pattern.",
    "This process just helps to loosen the curd and makes it easier to scoop out.",
    "Let the curds sit for 15 minutes with the heat still on.",
    "After you\u2019ve cut through the curds, you need to give them a little more time to rest.",
    "This helps them solidify more and lose any additional whey.",
    "Rotate stirring the curd and letting it sit every 5 minutes for an hour.",
    "Keep the temperature at 88 \u00b0F (31 \u00b0C).",
    "Gently stir the curds with your sterilized spoon every 5 minutes and then let the curds rest between stirs.",
    "This process ensures the curds lose as much of the whey as possible.",
    "Line your colander with your cheesecloth or muslin.",
    "Do this over the sink, as you\u2019ll be working there in just a minute.",
    "Make sure the sink is clean, and carefully lay the cloth over the bottom of the colander and up along the sides.",
    "Remember to use the cloth that you sanitized earlier.",
    "Transfer the curd carefully to the colander using the metal spoon.",
    "Scoop the curd out and place it in the colander, avoiding as much whey as you can.",
    "Let the curd drain through the cheesecloth for 10 minutes.",
    "Depending on how big your colander is, you may need to use 2 simultaneously to fit everything in.",
    "Mix salt in with your hands and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes.",
    "Use 2 tablespoons (17 grams) of kosher salt and sprinkle it evenly overtop of the curds.",
    "Then use your hands (wash them before touching the curd) to gently mix up all the curds.",
    "This will help them not coagulate together again.",
    "Then let the mixture sit for an additional 10 minutes.",
    "You may also be able to find specific cheese salt at the specialty cheese shop, which you can use, too.",
    "But kosher salt will also work just fine!",
    "Forming the Cheese Put the mat on your tray and put the cheese mold on top of that.",
    "Use the cheese or bamboo mats, the cookie sheet, and the cheese molds.",
    "Set up a station for yourself to get ready to fill the molds.",
    "The cookie sheet helps keep moisture from spreading to any surfaces, and it also keeps the cheese safe from any odd bacteria that might be on the counter.",
    "Fill the cheese mold with the drained curds.",
    "Use your disinfected spoon or your clean hands, and gently transfer curd from the colander to the cheese mold.",
    "Fill it up as high as you can.",
    "If the mold fills before you\u2019re out of curds, let the mold sit for 10 minutes to let extra moisture come out, and then continue filling it.",
    "Try to avoid pressing down on the curds.",
    "Just let them settle organically.",
    "Cover the mold and flip it every 15 minutes for 2 hours.",
    "Both ends of the mold will be covered with a cloth.",
    "Make sure to set the mold back down over the cookie tray each time to you flip it.",
    "This process helps the curd continue losing moisture so it can start to form in the right shape.",
    "Let the mold drain for 8 hours or overnight.",
    "Drain the tray, and then set the cheese mold, still sandwiched between two mats, back onto it.",
    "You can leave it for longer than the 8 hours, but at a minimum, that\u2019s how much time it\u2019ll need.",
    "If you have cats or other animals that might get onto the counters, set up a barricade so they can\u2019t get into the kitchen overnight.",
    "Aging the Cheese Remove the cheese from the mold and sprinkle salt all over it.",
    "Take your 5 gallon (19 liter) plastic bucket and set the grate in the bottom of it.",
    "Cover the grate with another cheese mat.",
    "Place the cheese inside the bucket, and then sprinkle it generously with kosher salt.",
    "Don\u2019t worry if some of the salt falls off!",
    "You\u2019re going to be using a lot of kosher salt over the next few days, so if you\u2019re starting to run out, make a trip to the store for more.",
    "Keep the bucket at about 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) in a dark location.",
    "A basement or dark closet should work well.",
    "Don\u2019t worry if the location is humid\u2014blue cheese thrives on humidity.",
    "Don\u2019t leave the bucket anywhere where it\u2019ll be exposed to the sun.",
    "It needs humidity but it doesn\u2019t need heat.",
    "Flip the cheese over and sprinkle it with salt every day for 3 days.",
    "If there is any whey that has drained off, take a moment to get rid of it when you add the new salt by draining it into a sink.",
    "Flipping the cheese lets you salt the other side periodically, and it also helps to keep shifting the weight so that the excess whey continues to come out.",
    "Continue flipping the cheese daily for 1 week, then flip it every 4-5 days.",
    "No need to salt the cheese anymore!",
    "Now you just need to flip the cheese and pay attention to how it looks on the outside.",
    "If you don\u2019t flip the cheese, it\u2019ll still be usable but it might take a strange pear- or apple-shaped form.",
    "Poke holes in the cheese when blue mold shows up on the outside.",
    "Sterilize a long skewer and stick it through the cheese in 3 or 4 different places.",
    "This is what will create those blue veins that run through the cheese.",
    "The holes let the penicillin from the blue cheese move around.",
    "Keep flipping the cheese every 2 days until you see red and white mold.",
    "Once this mold appears, use a long, thin, clean knife or cake frosting spatula to scrape off the mold.",
    "Throw it away, and return the cheese to the bucket.",
    "Keep doing this, at least once a month, whenever you notice the mold has grown a lot.",
    "Always make sure to disinfect your tools before you use them on your cheese.",
    "Scrape and wrap the cheese after 2.5 months, and store it in the fridge.",
    "After the long waiting time is over, give the cheese one additional scrape and then wrap it up tightly in either foil or a cheesecloth.",
    "Put the cheese in the bottom of your fridge to keep it nice and cold.",
    "Clean out your bucket really thoroughly so you can use it again for your next project!",
    "Enjoy the cheese right away, or let it keep aging for a few more months.",
    "Once the cheese is in your fridge, you can start using it.",
    "Just make sure to reseal it with the cheesecloth or foil after you\u2019re done each time.",
    "The longer you let it age in the fridge, the stronger the flavor will get.",
    "For a fun gift idea, you could wrap small parcels of blue cheese in cheesecloth, wrap it in butcher paper, tie it up with string, and decorate the paper."
