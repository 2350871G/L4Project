If not, then purchase the same amount of lining fabric as you needed for the skirt. Good lining fabrics include rayon, satin, and smooth cotton, but you can use anything you like as long as it won\u2019t cling to the skirt fabric or tights. If you needed 2 yd (1.8 m) of fabric for the skirt\u2019s exterior fabric, then you will need 2 yd (1.8 m) for the lining as well. If you want to line a pre-made skirt, measure the circumference of the widest part of the skirt and the length of the skirt. Add 6 in (15 cm) to this length and buy that amount of fabric. Keep in mind that you will have to rip the seams on the skirt and re-sew it to add a lining properly, so this is not recommended.Tip: If you want your lining to blend in with the garment, opt for lining in the same color as your skirt. If you want the lining to stand out, then opt for a bright color or print as your lining fabric."

Wash and dry the fabric according to its care instructions. This will vary depending on the type of fabric. For example, if you have chosen a silk fabric for the lining, then you might need to hand wash it and allow it to air dry. For specialty fabrics, you might even need to have the fabric dry cleaned."

This will ensure that the seams lay flat and improve the look of your finished skirt. Lay the fabric so that the wrong sides are facing up and then use your fingers to gently separate the seams. Then, run the iron along the open seams to make them lay flat. If your fabric is delicate, such as silk or satin, then use the lowest setting on your iron and lay a towel over the fabric before you iron it."

Sew all the way to the end of the waistband if you are creating an elastic waist. Stop sewing 1 in (2.5 cm) from the end if you\u2019re adding a zipper.
