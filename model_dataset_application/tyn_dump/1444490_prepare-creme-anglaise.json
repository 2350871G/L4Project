          "description":"Make an incision, lengthwise, down the center of the vanilla bean using a sharp paring knife. Be careful not to cut the bean all the way through. When done correctly, the bean will have an open slit running down one side, while the other side remains closed. This will allow the seeds inside the bean to emerge from the casing and flavor the cr\u00e8me anglaise. Vanilla beans can be found in specialty cooking shops or gourmet grocery stores. They can also be ordered online. The longer the vanilla bean, the stronger the vanilla flavor will be in the finished sauce. Look for a 2\u20134 inch (5.1\u201310.2 cm) piece for this recipe. If you don't have a vanilla bean, add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract instead. As an alternative try orange or lemon cr\u00e8me anglaise. Simply switch out the zest of 1 orange or 1 lemon for the vanilla bean."

          "description":"Fill the bottom of the bain marie with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water and place it on the stove on medium heat. Allow the water to come to a simmer. A bain marie, also known as a double boiler, is a pot nested inside another pot. The pot on the bottom is used to hold water, while the top pot holds the food item you are cooking. The purpose of a double boiler is to heat foods at a lower temperature. If you do not have a bain marie, fill a saucepan about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) with water and place a metal mixing bowl or a smaller pan on top."

Hold one hand over the container reserved for the egg whites and crack an egg into the hand. Let the egg whites slip through the space between your fingers, but not the yolk. Place the yolk in the bowl reserved for egg yolks. Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs (6 total) until all the egg yolks are separated from the egg whites. You can also separate eggs by holding a cracked egg over a bowl and passing the yolks back and forth between the shell halves so that the white drops into the bowl. Place the separated yolk into a second bowl."
