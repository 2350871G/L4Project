Beat the mixture on medium speed for 2 minutes. You can use a handheld electric mixer to mix the macaron batter if you prefer. To separate the egg white from the yolk, break the egg against a flat surface, such as a countertop. Separate the egg into two halves over a bowl, and allow the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth, letting the white drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk until you\u2019ve removed all of the egg white. Superfine sugar is also known as caster sugar."

Almond meal is a coarsely ground flour type product made from almonds. You can find it at most grocery stores, or you can make your own. If you don\u2019t have a sifter, you can use a fine mesh sieve to sift the powdered sugar and almond meal. Use a clean hand to push the mixture through the sieve."

Use a rubber spatula to fold the dry ingredients into the meringue until they\u2019re fully incorporated. You don\u2019t need to be particularly careful or gentle when you fold in the powdered sugar and almond meal because you want to knock some air out of the meringue mixture. When you\u2019ve finished mixing the batter, it should have a thick, paste-like consistency. If you want to make colorful macarons, you can add several drops of red, blue, green, or your favorite shade of food coloring to the batter and mix it in to tint the cookies."

Let the macaron batter rest in the bag for about 10 minutes before piping. A round tip that\u2019s between \u00bd- and 1-inch (13- to 25-mm) works best for piping the macarons. If you don\u2019t have a pastry bag, transfer the macaron batter to a large plastic zipper bag.

Tapping the baking sheets against a hard surface knocks the air bubbles out of the macarons so they won\u2019t crack when they bake.

When you\u2019re ready to make the cookies, cut off a corner of the bag with scissors and pipe directly from it. Baking the Macarons Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet. After you\u2019ve allowed the batter to rest for a while, use the pastry bag to pipe it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) mounds on the lined baking sheet. Make sure that the mounds are about 2-inches (5-cm) apart. Knock the baking sheet against a hard surface and air dry the macarons.

The macarons will expand slightly as they bake, which can also help you tell whether they\u2019re finished baking. Allow the macarons to cool. Once the macarons are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack to cool completely. It\u2019s important to make sure that the macarons are completely cool before you add the filling or it may melt off the cookies. Mixing the Filling Combine the butter, powdered sugar, cake mix, and butter extract. Add \u00bd cup (113 g) of softened butter, 1 \u00bd cups (150 g) of powdered sugar, \u2153 cup (42 g) of vanilla cake mix, and \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 ml) of butter extract to the bowl of stand mixer with the paddle attachment inserted.

Once the birthday cake filling is made, use the spatula to place it in a pastry bag. Make sure that the bag is fitted with a circular tip that\u2019s at least \u00bd-inch (13-mm) wide. If you don\u2019t have a pastry bag, you can use a plastic zipper bag just as you did to pipe the macarons. Assembling the Macarons Pair similar sized macarons and turn over.
