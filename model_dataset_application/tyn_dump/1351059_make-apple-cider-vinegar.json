Choose the best quality apples available to you in order to get the best apple cider vinegar at the end. For a more complex and deep vinegar at the end, try using a combination of different apples. Use two sweet apples, such as Golden Delicious or Gala, with one sharp tasting apple, such as McIntosh or Liberty, for a slightly sharper vinegar at the end. Instead of using whole apples, save scraps from apples used in other dishes to make your apple cider vinegar. One whole apple is roughly equivalent to the scraps of two apples. Keep the peel, core and other scraps in your freezer until you\u2019re ready to use them to make vinegar."

Give your apples a thorough rinse and scrub with cold water to clean away anything you don't want in your vinegar. You can use any number of apples you want to make apple cider vinegar. The more you use, the more vinegar you\u2019ll get! If you\u2019re just starting out making your own apple cider vinegar, try using 3 apples for your first batch. This will give you a good amount of vinegar but won\u2019t put too much at risk if something goes wrong. If you're using apple scraps, make sure to wash the whole apples before separating the scraps from the rest of the apples."

Use a clean knife to cut your apples into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes, keeping the peel and the core in as well. If you\u2019re using scraps from other apples, there\u2019s no need to cut them up further."

The apples shouldn\u2019t fill the jar more than \u00be of the way, so a quart jar or something bigger should work perfectly. Never use stainless steel to ferment your vinegar. As the apples ferment, the acidity of the vinegar can damage the steel, or impart a metallic taste into your vinegar that might change its flavor.."

          "description":"Make sure the apples are completely covered with water, as any exposed apple will begin to rot rather than ferment into vinegar. For the best results, use filtered or mineral water that will be free from any impurities that could ruin your vinegar. For a quart jar with three apples, you\u2019ll need around 800 millilitres (27  fl oz) of water. Use more or less as is needed. It\u2019s always better to add too much water than not enough. If you add too much, your apple cider vinegar might be a little weaker or take longer to ferment. If you don\u2019t add enough water, some apple will be exposed and might begin to rot and ruin your vinegar entirely."

Raw sugar works best for this, but you can use honey or any other sugar if you\u2019d prefer."

Over this time, the sweet cider scent should start developing a slightly more tangy aroma. This is a sign that the fermentation is working, and the cider is becoming vinegar. The longer you give the vinegar to ferment, the stronger the taste and tang will be. After around 3 weeks of fermentation, start tasting the vinegar every few days until you reach the taste and acidity you want.

Store the vinegar in your refrigerator and it should never go bad. Keeping the vinegar in the fridge should stop the fermentation process, but if left long enough it may continue. If the vinegar gets too strong, add a little bit of water to dilute it back down to the acidity you want. While you can safely store the apple cider vinegar at room temperature, it will continue to ferment if you do so. If a gelatinous blob forms on the surface of your vinegar, this is cause for celebration rather than worry. This is known as the vinegar \u201cmother\u201d and can be used to jumpstart future batches of apple cider vinegar.
