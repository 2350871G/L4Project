Place it on a lightly floured surface, and use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a circle that is approximately 16- to 18-inches (41- to 46-cm) in diameter. You can make your own pizza dough from scratch or buy premade pizza dough from your local grocery store or pizzeria.

          "description":"After you\u2019ve rolled out the pizza dough, place it on a pizza pan or stone to ready it for baking. The easiest way to transfer the dough to your baking surface is with a wooden pizza peel. Slide the peel under the dough and then shift it back and forth on the pan or stone to slide it off. If you don\u2019t have a pizza peel, you may want to lay parchment down on the surface where you\u2019re working before rolling out the dough. Roll the dough out on the floured parchment paper, and then you can just lift it by the edges of the paper and slide it onto your pan or stone."

Next, sprinkle 2 cups (226 g) of shredded pepper jack cheese, 1 roasted poblano pepper that\u2019s been diced, and \u2153 cup (15 g) of chopped cilantro over the dough, leaving a border around the edge to serve as the crust. You can add other toppings to the pizza if you like. Some options that work well with the avocado and other ingredients include cooked, diced chicken, grilled corn kernels, and diced red onion."
