          "description":"For any variety of mint, the herb is ready for harvest just before it reaches its flowering stage. Cut the mint in the morning, after any dew has dried, using garden pruners or a sharp knife. Cut the mint about one-third of the length down the main stem. Doing so ensures that the plant will have enough strength to grow back. Cutting the mint just before it flowers will give you the most aroma and flavor since this is the point in the growing cycle at which the leaves contain the most oil. Gently shake each branch after cutting it to remove any insects that might be hiding out."

Lay the mint out on a paper towel and pat it dry. Then, lay out the mint in a single layer on a paper towel and allow the stems and leaves to air-dry for another hour or two. Be sure that none of the mint is stacked. If using a salad spinner, place the bunches of mint in your salad spinner and dry the visible water off using the device. You should still lay the mint out on clean paper towels afterward to continue drying for another hour or two."
