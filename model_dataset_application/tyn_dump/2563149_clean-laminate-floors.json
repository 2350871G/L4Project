          "description":"Sweep a dry dust mop across the surface of the floor every few days to remove everyday dirt. Even though laminate flooring is fairly scratch-resistant, excess dirt, hair, and debris can cause scratches to develop if allowed to build up over time. Regular sweeping prevents such scratches from forming. Instead of using a dry dust mop, you could also use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment. Do not use a standard floor brush. The stiff, straw-like bristles on the brush could damage the surface. Sweep in the direction that the laminate floor tiles were laid. Doing so allows you to pick up any debris that falls in between the grooves of the laminate flooring pieces."

Liquid can stain or damage the protective wear layer of the laminate flooring. Soak up excess liquid with a dry cloth. Dampen the cloth or sponge before spot-cleaning the location of the spill to remove any remaining residue. Dry the spot with a dry, soft cloth. Do not allow the area to remain wet."

If your floor is looking dingy, use a mop and some elbow grease to clean it. It may take several passes to get the floor clean, but the mop is safer for your floors. If you can't get your floor clean no matter what you try, you can always call a professional."

Be sure to read the label and use the product correctly, as a little product goes a long way. Avoid using cleaners that promise to create a shiny surface, as these products can cause a waxy buildup on your floors. Similarly, don't use pine scented products on your laminate floors, as they may leave a dull, soapy residue."

Hot water is often considered one of the best ways to clean laminate flooring because, when done correctly, it will not leave streaks.

Diluted vinegar is especially useful when your laminate floor has caked on mud or other stains that have caused it to become faded or dull.
