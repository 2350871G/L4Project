  "text":" Three Egg Yolk Hollandaise Sauce Cut the butter into small chunks with a sharp knife.  Whisk the egg yolks with the tablespoon of water in a heavy-based saucepan.

Add salt and pepper to taste.  Pour in the lemon juice whilst still adding the remaining butter chunks.  Remove the sauce from the heat once the sauce has a smooth and creamy consistency.  Serve. Hollandaise sauce goes well with poached fish, eggs and steamed vegetables. Five Egg Yolk Hollandaise Sauce Pour 4 tablespoons of water in the saucepan. Add the salt and freshly ground pepper. Put the saucepan base into the bain marie (double boiler). The bain marie should already contain hot water but not boiling at any time. Melt the butter in a separate saucepan. Do not let it get hot, just melt gently. Crack the eggs and separate the yolks into a bowl. You can use the whites for something else. Beat the egg yolks to combine, then add 1 tablespoon of water. Transfer the egg yolks to the saucepan with warmed water and seasonings. Whisk the ingredients as they sit in the saucepan within the bain marie. Continue to whisk until the egg yolks take on the consistency of thickened cream. Pour the melted butter in slowly, whisking constantly. Add 2 tablespoons of water gradually in drops, once the butter has been completely added. Taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed. Once happy with the flavor, add the lemon juice and stir through quickly. Transfer to a serving container, as desired. If needed, the sauce can be strained. Serve warm.
