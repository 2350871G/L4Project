The screws are secured by two nuts underneath. In the front of the cover, look for a small groove that is designed to help you pry up the cover. Then, use a small screwdriver to pry up both the seat and the cover. In cheap toilets, the screws are made of plastic. Most toilets, however, use steel screws, and more expensive models may even use brass or stainless steel. Be especially careful with plastic screws!"
