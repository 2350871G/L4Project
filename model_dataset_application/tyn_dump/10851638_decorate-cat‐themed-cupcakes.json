Use the pink candy melts to fill in the white V shapes and make triangles. Allow ears to cool completely before removing them from the parchment paper Making Cat Faces Frost the cupcake. Using an angled spatula or butter knife, frost the cupcake with enough white frosting to cover the top and smooth it out to create a flat surface. Make the eyes. Using black frosting, make two vertical lines on the top third of the cupcake. Make the nose. Using pink frosting, make an upside-down triangle/heart under the two eyes to make the nose. Start piping one corner of the nose and move your hand as if you were writing the letter V. Make the mouth. Use black frosting to make the mouth of the cat. Start piping from the bottom of the nose and make a backward \"J\" shape. Pipe another J shape for the other side of the mouth. Make the whiskers.

Making Balls of Yarn Make the first layer of yarn. Use blue frosting to make horizontal lines on the bottom third of the cupcake. Rotate the cupcake 120 degrees clockwise. Make the second layer of yarn. Use blue frosting to make more horizontal lines on the bottom half of the cupcake starting from the left side. Rotate the cupcake 120 degrees.
