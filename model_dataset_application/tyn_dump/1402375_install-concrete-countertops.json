Place the template onto a sheet of melamine, which is plywood with a stick resistant plastic coating, and cut out the outer dimensions of the shape formed by the template. To form the sides of the template, rip a sheet of melamine into 2 by 4 strips and nail them in place, then seal the joints with silicone caulk, allowing it to dry overnight. Carry the dry form to where your countertop will be and set it in place, removing any doors, drawers and hardware from the cabinet on which it will sit.  Mix the concrete according to the manufacturer's specifications, using a mason's hoe to blend the dry ingredients first, then carefully measuring and slowly pouring in the water, mixing as you pour.  Pour the concrete mixture into the template form until it is about two-thirds full.  Hold a running orbital sander on edge up against the bottom of the template form to shake and level the concrete mixture and eliminate air bubbles.  Cut and place steel reinforcing mesh on top of the concrete mixture and repeat the process with the orbital sander to sink the mesh into the mixture.  Pour a second layer of concrete mixture into the form until it reaches the rim.  Scrape off any excess and smooth the concrete by running the flat edge of a board across the surface while holding the ends of the board firmly to the form's edges.
