Preparing for Installation Remove all food and dishes from your cabinets. Before lining your cabinet shelves, you\u2019ll need to empty them out completely. Take out all of your non-perishable bottles, cans, and boxes of food as well as all dishes and cooking utensils. Put these items on a nearby flat surface that\u2019s out of the way, such as your kitchen table. Clean the interior with all-purpose cleaner or a vinegar solution.

Touch the shelves after this amount of time has gone by to check that they\u2019re fully dry. Installing Your Shelf Liner Measure the liner material. Use the quilting ruler to measure your liner to fit the measurements of the shelves that you wrote down earlier. Mark the top and bottom of the paper with a pencil or pen. Cut the liner material. Use scissors or place a cutting mat underneath the liner and then cut it with a rotary cutter. Use the quilting ruler as a guide while you\u2019re cutting the liner. Repeat this process to create as many pieces of liner as there are shelves. Place the liner on the shelf and smooth it out. Take the backing off of your contact liner paper and carefully place it on your shelf. Go over the liner with a squeegee to eliminate any bubbles or wrinkles. Put a small blob of reusable mounting putty in each corner of the cabinet before placing in spongy or plastic liner to secure it. Repeat these actions for each shelf in your kitchen cabinets. One by one, take the pre-cut pieces of liner, place them in each shelf space, and smooth them out until all of your shelves are lined.",
