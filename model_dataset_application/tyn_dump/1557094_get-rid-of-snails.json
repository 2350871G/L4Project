Bury the container in you garden or near the place where you saw the snails, but leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the soil. The smell of the beer will attract the snails, which will drown in the container. Adding yeast will make the traps more enticing to the snails. You may need to put out multiple traps, as they will only be effective for snails that are close by. Other great options for your beer container include a plastic cup, yogurt cup, bowl, or pie dish.

You might also decide to kill the snails. To make the process quicker, you can put an overturned pot or bowl in your garden or near the area where you\u2019ve seen the snails.

It may kill some snails, and it will also deter them away. To make your garlic spray, soak 3 crushed garlic cloves in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil overnight. Then, strain the liquid into 1 litre (4.2  c) of water. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of liquid soap to the solution, then shake the bottle before using."

After they ingest it, they will die within 3 days. This product is generally safe for use around your yard, but keep your children and pets away from the area.

    "You can apply copper tape around potted plants, around your garden edges, or wherever the snails are going.",
    "If you\u2019re using wire, tie it around your pots or make copper garden stakes.",
    "As another option, you can sprinkle pennies around the area, as they contain copper.",
    "You can find copper tape at a local gardening store or online.",
    "Add plants that naturally deter snails.",
    "These include foxglove, euphorbias, Japanese anemones, day lilies, succulents, astrantia, salvia, and fennel.",
    "Each of these plants has either a smell that snails don\u2019t like or an uncomfortable surface that makes it hard for the snail to climb around it.",
    "If you have these in your garden or around your home, snails are less likely to stick around.",
    "For example, you might put a potted plant near the area where snails are crawling on your home.",
    "Keep in mind that foxglove is toxic, so it may not be a good option if you have children and pets in your home.",
    "Keeping Your Aquarium Snail-Free Quarantine plants for 2 weeks before putting them into your aquarium.",
    "Aquarium plants are the most common source of unwanted snails.",
    "They often harbor eggs or baby snails, which then reproduce once they\u2019re in your tank.",
    "Fortunately, you can avoid putting infected plants into your aquarium by quarantining them for 2 weeks before putting them in your tank.",
    "If you see any snails during the quarantine period, pick them off the plant as soon as you notice them.",
    "Treat plants in a 1:19 bleach-water solution before adding them to your aquarium.",
    "Create your bleach solution by adding 1 part bleach to 19 parts water.",
    "Then, dip each individual plant into the solution and immediately withdraw it.",
    "This will kill any lingering snails or eggs.",
    "Rinse the plant in fresh water before putting it in your aquarium.",
    "You only need to submerge the plant in the solution for a second for it to work, so it's okay to just dip and remove the plant in one motion.",
    "Clean the entire aquarium, including removing the gravel.",
    "You can purge all of the snails by hand if you have the time.",
    "Move your fish to a temporary tank, then empty the water from the aquarium.",
    "Remove everything, including the gravel and substrate, from the tank, then scrub all of the snails from the sides of the tank.",
    "Replace your gravel and substrate for best results.",
    "Before you put your plants and other fixtures back in the aquarium, clean them.",
    "One way to do this is to dip them in a cleaning solution that\u2019s 19 parts water and 1 part bleach.",
    "This will kill any snails or eggs that are on them.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to take everything out of the tank, you can use a siphon to suck out just the gravel and substrate.",
    "Additionally, you\u2019ll need to pick the snails off the sides of the tank.",
    "Introduce fish that eat snails.",
    "Some fish eat snails and can clear out your tank for you.",
    "When selecting a predator fish, check its fact sheet to make sure it won\u2019t eat your other fish.",
    "Additionally, make sure it\u2019s not too big for your tank.",
    "For a small fish tank, you might choose a zebra or dwarf chain loach.",
    "If you have a large fish tank, you can choose a clown loach, pictus catfish, koi, or large goldfish.",
    "As an alternative, you might place an assassin snail into your tank.",
    "It will enjoy eating the other snails in the tank and won\u2019t reproduce often.",
    "Put a snail trap in your tank to catch and remove the snails.",
    "A snail trap entices the snails to enter a cage then prevents them from leaving.",
    "This allows you to easily catch and remove all of the snails without harming your fish.",
    "You can find snail traps at your local pet store or online.",
    "You can make your own snail trap by clipping a large piece of lettuce to the side of your tank.",
    "Leave it in place overnight, then remove it in the morning.",
    "It should attract a fair number of snails, which will now be gone from your tank!",
    "Add fish-friendly copper sulfate to your aquarium to kill the snails.",
    "Snails are sensitive to copper, so they will die if the water contains copper sulfate.",
    "Most fish are unaffected by copper sulfate, making it a safe option for most aquariums.",
    "If you\u2019re worried about your fish dying, check their fact sheet to see if they are sensitive to copper.",
    "Don\u2019t use this treatment if you have shrimp or ornamental snails, as they are also sensitive to copper.",
    "You can find copper sulfate at a local pet store or online."
