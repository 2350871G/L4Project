          "description":"Sometimes, screws can cause minor damage to wood surfaces as they\u2019re driven in. If this is the case with the surface you\u2019re patching, grab a sheet of medium- or high-grit sandpaper and go over the area using light, circular strokes. The sandpaper will help remove splinters, loose chunks, and other irregularities. A sandpaper with a grit between 100 and 120 will offer the right balance of abrasion and smoothness."

          "description":"Wet a clean, lint-free cloth or sturdy paper towel and squeeze out the excess water. Run the cloth or paper towel over the screw hole and surrounding wood. Allow the area to dry completely when you\u2019re finished. Before you actually begin filling the hole, you want to make sure that it\u2019s completely free of dust, dirt, or debris that might otherwise find its way into your filler and prevent you from getting a consistent finish. Steer clear of cheap paper towels. These have a tendency to shed tiny bits of paper that can leave the wood in worse shape than it was in to begin with."

          "description":"Use the tip of a putty knife to transfer a liberal amount of filler into the hole, then smooth it with the flat part of the blade until it\u2019s level. Ideally, the smoothed wood filler should sit just above the surface of the wood. The key to getting a seamless finish is to use more wood filler than you think you need, as most fillers tend to shrink as they dry. If you go a little overboard with the wood filler, simply turn your putty knife onto its side and scrape off the extra compound with the edge of the blade. Be sure to select a stainable type of wood filler if you're planning on staining your surface.Alternative: Whip up your own easy homemade wood filler by mixing together equal parts high-strength wood glue and sawdust from scrap wood with a color similar to that of the surface you\u2019re working on."

Doing so could smear or leave behind noticeable depressions in the still-wet compound, ruining all your hard work. Most wood fillers are formulated to harden within about an hour, but drying times can vary between products. Be sure to check the label of the wood filler you\u2019re using for more specific drying instructions. To cut down on your overall project time, apply your wood filler in a dry, climate-controlled indoor space. Heat and moisture could extend the product\u2019s drying time.

If you\u2019re working with an angle-cut plug, the bottom surface will be the angled face. With a cylindrical plug, it doesn\u2019t matter which side you spread the glue on.

Still, it\u2019s a good idea to leave it alone for a few extra minutes just to make sure that it bonds properly. In the meantime, resist the urge to fidget with the plug, as this could cause it to come loose.

Run the chisel back and forth over the plug as many times as necessary to shave it down flush with the surrounding surface. Be careful not to bear down too heavily with your chisel. You could end up scarring or gouging the wood if you push too hard. A flush cut saw will also do the trick.

Brush on 1-2 coats of a suitable primer or wood conditioner, then follow up with 2-3 coats of paint or stain in your chosen shade. Allow each coat to dry thoroughly before applying your next one, and let your topcoat dry for at least 24 hours before handling or making any other modifications to the surface. You can use as many as 6-7 coats of stain to achieve a deeper, richer finish. Wood plugs are made from genuine wood, so they can be painted or stained just like any other wood surface. There's no need to paint or stain if you'd rather leave the natural charm of your wood surface on display. When chosen and installed properly, wood plugs are virtually invisible, thanks to their similarities in tone and grain pattern."

    "Wood plugs are made from genuine wood, so they can be painted or stained just like any other wood surface.",
    "There's no need to paint or stain if you'd rather leave the natural charm of your wood surface on display.",
    "When chosen and installed properly, wood plugs are virtually invisible, thanks to their similarities in tone and grain pattern."
