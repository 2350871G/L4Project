  "text":" Coconut Milk from Shredded Coconut Buy a bag of shredded coconut. Look for the unsweetened kind in the grocery store aisle near the baking supplies. If you can't find shredded coconut, shaved coconut also works quite well. Measure out the shredded coconut. Every cup of coconut will end up translating into two cups of milk. Measure out the coconut into a blender or high-powered food processor. Boil water. You'll need two cups of water for every cup of coconut you have. Measure out the correct number of cups into a pot.

Not everyone agrees with using dairy or other plant milk to make coconut milk from; decide for yourself what you prefer. Water is just fine, as is using a plant milk. Simmer gently for 2-4 minutes on low heat. Stir frequently. Do not allow to boil. Strain through a sieve that is lined with muslin or cheesecloth. Pour the liquid into a bowl.
