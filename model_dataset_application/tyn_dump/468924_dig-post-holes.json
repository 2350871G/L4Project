          "description":"This tool is designed specifically for the task, and will enable you to do the job in the least time with minimum effort. There are a few things you need to consider, however, before starting. Check the soil consistency. Rocky soils are difficult to use post hole diggers in, since a relatively small stone will prevent the cutting edge of the diggers from penetrating the soil. You can use a steel rock bar to loosen the rocks before using the post hole digger. Very loose, sandy, and dry soils, or otherwise stubborn ground, are hard to remove from the hole, as the clamping action of the jaws is not as effective on these non-cohesive materials. If you have time, start the holes one day, fill them with water and come back to remove the much softened soil the next day. Measure and mark the location of each fence post. Post hole diggers have a maximum effective depth of about 3/4 of their handle length, so a five foot pair will dig about 3 1/2 half deep. Very hard earth like clay is extremely difficult to dig with a manual pair of post hole diggers. A rock bar may work on dry clay."

Using stakes and a string line to guide you, and a long measuring tape to establish your spacing will help for this purpose. Plant the stakes on either end of the line that you want to dig along. Tie the string to one stake, pull taut, and tie to the other stake. The average spacing for posts is eight feet (2.4 m), though depending upon the structure you could space them further apart."

Allowing the soil to soak up moisture will improve your success and make the job easier. Installing Your Posts Install your posts.'\" Install the posts, pole, or other item for which you have dug your hole. Use fine gravel tamped down to the bottom six inches  (15 cm) and set your post.
