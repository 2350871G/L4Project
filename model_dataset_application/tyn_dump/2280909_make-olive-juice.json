Water-cured olives can be used if you want a fresher flavor, but these olives tend to be considerably bitterer and do not last quite as long as brine-cured olives. You could use fresh olives during harvest season, which falls out around late September through mid November, but fresh olives have a very bitter taste that may make the juice less palatable. Dried olives should be avoided, since they do not contain enough juice to extract. Use whole or pitted olives. Avoid olives that are stuffed with other ingredients."

If you do not pierce the olives, however, the juice may struggle to break through the skin and reach the liquid."
