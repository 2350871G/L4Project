Gently swish the water around until the sides of the cup are wet all the way around, then tip the cup over your sink to pour out any extra water. Don\u2019t use hot water to rinse out your cup. If the water is too warm, it might dissolve the baking soda, so it won\u2019t scrub away the stain as effectively."

          "description":"Add the baking soda while the inside of your cup is still wet. You can measure the baking soda if you\u2019d like, but you can also just estimate the amount you want to use. If you pour in too much, just shake out a little into a dish and discard it. If you don\u2019t have enough, sprinkle in a little more. Baking soda is a natural cleaner, and it will help absorb the stains from the inside of the cup. Tip: You can also mix a few drops of hydrogen peroxide into about 1 tbsp (20 g) of baking soda to form a thick paste, then spread that inside of the cup."

Then, roll the cup toward you, shaking it so the baking soda falls forward as you do so. Do this until the entire inside of the cup is covered in the baking soda. The baking soda should stick to the water on the inside of the cup, forming a thin layer over the stains."

It\u2019s okay if some of it falls off of the sides, but if you notice that most of the baking soda is falling off, you may have had too much water on the inside of your cup, and you may need to start the process over. If you\u2019re in a hurry, you can rinse your teacup after 5 minutes. You may not remove the stain completely, but it should be noticeably lighter, and you can repeat the process after your next cup of tea if you\u2019d like."
