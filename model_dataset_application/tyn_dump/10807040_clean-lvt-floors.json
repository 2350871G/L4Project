For homes with pets, children, or lots of people, you may need to vacuum several times per week. Keeping the floor free of dirt prevents scratches and helps the floor to look its best. Don\u2019t use the bar beater attachment on the vacuum cleaner, as this can cause scratches. Use a soft-bristled broom to prevent damage to the floor. Make sure to vacuum or sweep under furniture like beds and tables."

Always start in a corner or the point that is furthest away, and work your way towards the entrance. Always use as little water as possible when mopping. This is the most effective for cleaning and it also means that the floor dries faster. Avoid leaving large puddles on LVT flooring, as this can cause damage. If the floor is especially dirty, try adding a few drops of mild dish detergent to the warm water. Don't use commercial cleaning products or vinegar for mopping LVT floors, as these can cause damage."

Avoid touching or walking on the mopped floor as much as possible until it's completely dry. The actual drying time depends on how much water is on the floor, the temperature, and the humidity. This is especially important if you have young children or animals, as they can easily slip and get hurt."

Prevent these scratches by placing floor protectors on the feet of chairs and tables, and on the base of beds, appliances, and cabinets. Simply remove the label on the back of the floor protectors to reveal the adhesive and stick these to the parts of the furniture that touch the LVT. Floor protectors are small, adhesive felt pads.
