          "description":"If you already own a tunic that you love and fits you well, you can use it to replicate and make your own pattern. To do this, you\u2019ll need to trace each section of the tunic on large paper. A simple tunic will have just two parts; the front and the back. If you want to add sleeves, you\u2019ll need to trace those too. While tracing, use pushpins to hold the garment in place. Make sure you label each drawing so later on you\u2019ll remember where each piece goes."

Use a measuring tape to measure the fullest part around your bust, true waist, and hips. Then measure the length of your back (from the neck to the waistline), the width of the chest, width of the back, and distance from the neck to the shoulder bone. Then use these measurements to draw the pattern on a large piece of paper. Make sure you are standing nice and straight while taking these measurements. If your tunic is going to have sleeves, measure around the fullest part of your upper arm."

Work carefully to make sure you cut on the lines. Try your best to avoid folding or wrinkling the paper. If the paper has wrinkling or creases, carefully dry iron the paper on low heat to make it smooth."

For example, if you plan on wearing your tunic in the summer time, pick a fabric that\u2019s light and airy, such as linen or chiffon. Choose a thicker fabric in cooler temperatures, like flannel or wool. Some thin fabrics are more difficult to manipulate and sew. So if you\u2019re a beginner, consider choosing a thicker fabric, such as knit or double gauze. Use your pattern as a guide to picking the right fabric. For example, avoid denim if you want a tunic that drapes or stretches because this material is very heavyweight. Instead, choose knit or silk."

The rule is to determine the length of your tunic, and then get double that length of fabric plus an extra \u20444 metre (0.27 yd). For a knee length tunic, it is recommended to purchase 2.25 yards (2.06 m) of fabric. Of course, the amount of yardage will depend on your height and weight. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on whether or not to wash the fabric before sewing.

Folding the fabric in half will give you the front and back of the tunic. To keep the pattern pieces in place, use sewing pins or pattern weights.

You can use tailor\u2019s chalk, a marking pen, or even bar soap. This will help you to cut your fabric straight and precise. There are pros and cons to each type of marking tool. For example, tailor\u2019s chalk is very easy to use, but it can fade very quickly with the slightest touch. Choose the marking tool that you believe will do the best job for your garment."

Cut with one hand holding the scissors and the other hand holding the fabric. Cut it as accurately as possible to ensure your fabric pieces match the pattern. Make sure your fabric scissors are as sharp as possible. Dull scissors may snag your fabric. Use a rotary cutter for thicker fabrics, such as leather.

You can also use a sewing machine for this step and each subsequent step. Take your two bodice fabrics and sew a seam along the shoulder line to join them together. Do a lapped seam for heavy fabrics like leather or suede. Try a French seam for thin or sheer fabrics.
