Use a tape measure to measure the entire width of your building. Measure as precisely as possible, down to the \u20444 inch (0.64 cm), \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) , or \u204416 inch (0.16 cm) . For example, the width of the building may be 72.75 inches (184.8 cm). Use a pencil to jot the width down somewhere. Write on a spare sheet of paper or a section of exposed wood. Making these measurements 2 or 3 times is a good way to ensure accuracy."

So, use a tape measure to find the height of the roof above the top wall of the building. Also measure the length of half of the roof from one side of the ridge beam to the edge of the building.

Jot down this number alongside the others you\u2019ve already written. Making the Plumb Cut Fix stair gauges on the framing square to mark the pitch. So, if the pitch of your roof is 7/12, place one stair gauge on the vertical part of the framing square (the \u201ctongue\u201d) at the 7 inches (18 cm) mark, and place one stair gauge on the horizontal part of the framing square (the \u201cbody\u201d) at the 12 inches (30 cm) mark. This will give the framing square the angle you need to make the ridge cut. You can purchase both stair gauges and a framing square at your local hardware store. Mark the plumb cut at the top of the rafter. The plumb (or ridge) cut is made at the top of the rafter. Choose which end of your rafter you want to be the top. Set the framing square on top of the rafter beam, with the tongue facing the top of the rafter. Then, use a pencil to trace the outside edge of the framing square\u2019s tongue. Since you\u2019ve attached stair gauges to the framing square, the line you\u2019ve drawn will be at the correct angle for the rafter to lay flat against the ridge beam.

Measuring the diagonal will allow you to make the tail and bird's mouth cuts in the correct locations. In this example, the diagonal measurement that you found earlier was 39.81 inches (101.1 cm). Position the framing square to make the birdsmouth cut. Align the framing square so that the stair gauge that you\u2019ve placed on the tongue (short edge) of the framing square is on the pencil mark you made to indicate the full diagonal length of the rafter. Hold the long end of the framing square so that the other stair gauge is also resting against the rafter; this will ensure that you mark the tail cut at the correct angle. Use your pencil to trace the full length of the tongue along the width of the rafter. Determine the depth of the birdsmouth cut. This is relatively simple: measure the full width of the outside wall. For most buildings, the birdsmouth cut is 4 inches (10 cm) deep: the width of the 2x4 used to frame the outer wall measures 3.75 inches (9.5 cm), and the outside sheathing measure \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Sheathing is the term used for the board or panel that forms the outer surface of a building. Position the body of the framing square on the rafter. Use the body (long side) of the framing square. Rotate it 180\u00b0 from how you\u2019ve been using it (so the right angle is pointing up). Set it so that the 8-inch (20 cm) mark on the body of the framing square intersects the line for the tail cut. This will provide a 4 in (10 cm) birdsmouth cut. Use your pencil to trace this line onto the wood. If your bird's mouth cut is not 4 inches (10 cm) deep, slide the framing square to shorten or lengthen the length of the cut accordingly. Measure the rafter overhang. If, for example, you want the rafter to overhang the edge of your building by 6 inches (15 cm), measure this now. Keep the framing square in the position that it was set in to measure the birdsmouth cut. Slide the framing square until the 6 in (15 cm) mark intersects the line you\u2019ve marked for the birdsmouth cut.

    "So, if the pitch of your roof is 7/12, place one stair gauge on the vertical part of the framing square (the \u201ctongue\u201d) at the 7 inches (18 cm) mark, and place one stair gauge on the horizontal part of the framing square (the \u201cbody\u201d) at the 12 inches (30 cm) mark.",
    "This will give the framing square the angle you need to make the ridge cut.",
    "You can purchase both stair gauges and a framing square at your local hardware store.",
    "Mark the plumb cut at the top of the rafter.",
    "The plumb (or ridge) cut is made at the top of the rafter.",
    "Choose which end of your rafter you want to be the top.",
    "Set the framing square on top of the rafter beam, with the tongue facing the top of the rafter.",
    "Then, use a pencil to trace the outside edge of the framing square\u2019s tongue.",
    "Since you\u2019ve attached stair gauges to the framing square, the line you\u2019ve drawn will be at the correct angle for the rafter to lay flat against the ridge beam.",
    "Saw along the line you\u2019ve marked to indicate the plumb cut.",
    "Using a handsaw or a circular saw, cut the rafter along the line you\u2019ve just marked.",
    "Be sure to follow the line exactly, or you\u2019ll have an uneven plumb cut.",
    "Clamp the rafter to a workbench or sawhorses before cutting to ensure stability.",
    "C-clamps would work well for this.",
    "If you\u2019re using a handsaw, grasp the handle firmly in your dominant hand.",
    "Saw back and forth using the full length of the blade.",
    "Measuring and Marking the Birdsmouth and Tail Cuts Measure the diagonal of the rafter.",
    "Start this measurement from the top (the long end) of the cut you just made.",
    "When the rafter is installed, this top/long end will be at the peak of the ridge beam.",
    "Hook your tape measure on to the rafter, and measure the diagonal rafter length that you calculated earlier.",
    "Use your pencil to mark the length directly on the rafter.",
    "The diagonal measurement is the full length of the rafter, minus the overhang.",
    "Measuring the diagonal will allow you to make the tail and bird's mouth cuts in the correct locations.",
    "In this example, the diagonal measurement that you found earlier was 39.81 inches (101.1 cm).",
    "Position the framing square to make the birdsmouth cut.",
    "Align the framing square so that the stair gauge that you\u2019ve placed on the tongue (short edge) of the framing square is on the pencil mark you made to indicate the full diagonal length of the rafter.",
    "Hold the long end of the framing square so that the other stair gauge is also resting against the rafter; this will ensure that you mark the tail cut at the correct angle.",
    "Use your pencil to trace the full length of the tongue along the width of the rafter.",
    "Determine the depth of the birdsmouth cut.",
    "This is relatively simple: measure the full width of the outside wall.",
    "For most buildings, the birdsmouth cut is 4 inches (10 cm) deep: the width of the 2x4 used to frame the outer wall measures 3.75 inches (9.5 cm), and the outside sheathing measure \u20442 inch (1.3 cm).",
    "Sheathing is the term used for the board or panel that forms the outer surface of a building.",
    "Position the body of the framing square on the rafter.",
    "Use the body (long side) of the framing square.",
    "Rotate it 180\u00b0 from how you\u2019ve been using it (so the right angle is pointing up).",
    "Set it so that the 8-inch (20 cm) mark on the body of the framing square intersects the line for the tail cut.",
    "This will provide a 4 in (10 cm) birdsmouth cut.",
    "Use your pencil to trace this line onto the wood.",
    "If your bird's mouth cut is not 4 inches (10 cm) deep, slide the framing square to shorten or lengthen the length of the cut accordingly.",
    "Measure the rafter overhang.",
    "If, for example, you want the rafter to overhang the edge of your building by 6 inches (15 cm), measure this now.",
    "Keep the framing square in the position that it was set in to measure the birdsmouth cut.",
    "Slide the framing square until the 6 in (15 cm) mark intersects the line you\u2019ve marked for the birdsmouth cut.",
    "Overhang is the portion of the rafter that will extend past the edge of the building\u2019s wall.",
    "This will lengthen the total length of the rafter by 6 inches (15 cm), bring the new total length to 45.81 inches (116.4 cm).",
    "Trace the tail cut.",
    "Keep the framing square in the same position, and use your pencil to trace the tongue (short side) along the surface of the rafter.",
    "(The stair gauges will hold the framing square at the proper angle.)",
    "This will mark the tail cut: the very end of your rafter, with the 6 inches (15 cm) overhang built in and the birdsmouth cut neatly marked.",
    "Now all that\u2019s left is to cut the rafter accordingly.",
    "Making the Birdsmouth and Tail Cuts Saw along the line you marked for the birdsmouth cut.",
    "Be very precise with this cut since, unlike the plumb cut, you can\u2019t saw all the way through the board.",
    "Carefully follow the lines you\u2019ve marked for the tail cut so that it maintains the specific measurements and angles.",
    "For added stability when making the birdsmouth and tail cuts, use C-clamps to clamp the rafter to a workbench or sawhorses.",
    "Saw along the line you marked for the tail cut.",
    "Using your handsaw or circular saw, cut precisely along the line that you\u2019ve marked for the tail cut.",
    "The excess rafter material will fall off as you complete this cut, leaving you with the finished rafter.",
    "Repeat the process for your other rafters.",
    "At this point, you\u2019ve cut 1 roof rafter.",
    "Depending on the size of your structure, you will need to cut several (or many) more.",
    "All roof rafters should be identical, so follow the same steps to measure the plumb cut, tail cut, and birdsmouth cut.",
    "The number of rafters needed will be determined by the length of your roof.",
    "Rafters are commonly spaced about 24 inches (61 cm) apart.",
    "Refer to this chart for more detailed rafter-spacing information: https://www.mycarpentry.com/rafter-span-tables.html.",
    "Keep in mind that you\u2019ll always need an even number of rafters."
