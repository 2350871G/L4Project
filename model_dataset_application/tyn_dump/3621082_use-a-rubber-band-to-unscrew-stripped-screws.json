Make sure you have a good grip on it and are able to keep it firmly against the metal for a few seconds. If you need to, reposition the item with the screw so that you have easier access to it. The entire rubber band doesn\u2019t have to be over the screw. If the band is whole, move the excess aside. You may find the removal process a little easier if the band has broken open. For example, if the screw is in a board, try putting the board in a vise. Use the vise to keep the board still while you attempt to remove the screw."

You should feel the screw begin to turn and come loose. Reposition the rubber band if necessary and continue working until you are able to remove the screw. The screwdriver may penetrate the rubber band at some point, especially if you\u2019re using an electric screwdriver. Move the rubber band over so you can use an unbroken section of it. Even if you do everything right, you may not succeed at removing the screw this way. When this happens, try using other tools, such as a drill."
