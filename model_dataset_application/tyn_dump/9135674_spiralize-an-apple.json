  "text":" Using a Countertop Spiralizer Set up the spiralizer. Place the spiralizer on your counter and turn the counter clamps down so the spiralizer is suctioned into place. Place a baking sheet or bowl at the end of the spiralizer. This will catch the spiralized apple as it comes out. Slice the apple and place it on the spiralizer. Pull out the stem from your apple and slice the ends off of the apple so it sits level. Discard the trimmed ends and push a flat end of the apple against the pronged part of the spiralizer. The apple should be centered and secure. Turn the spiralizer crank in a clockwise motion. The apple will push against the blade so it's cut into thin strips. The apple strips should fall into the bowl or baking sheet that's sitting at the end of the spiralizer. Most spiralizers come with several blade attachments so you can adjust the size of the apple strips. Using a Handheld Spiralizer Cut the apple into wedges. If you don't have the counter space for a large spiralizer, you can buy a small handheld one. Cut an apple into three or four large wedges. If you don't want to pick seeds out of the spiralized apple, you can remove the core. Use thin-skinned apples (such as Gala or Golden Delicious) for handheld spiralizers. Thick-skinned apples can easily clog the blades. Insert a fork into one of the wedges and place it in the spiralizer. Take a fork and stick it into the end of one large wedge. Hold the fork and stick the apple into the end of the spiralizer that has the blades. You don't have to use a fork to turn the apple, but a fork will make it easier to hold the apple. Twist the fork to scrape the apple against the blades. Hold the spiralizer over a bowl or dish. Turn the fork in a clockwise motion so the apple is pushed against the blades on the side of the spiralizer. The spiralized apple will fall into the bowl or dish. Using Spiralized Apples Stir the spiralized apples into pancake or waffle batter. If you enjoy moist, sweet pancakes or waffles, stir one spiralized apple into the batter and bake the pancakes or waffles as usual. Or if you'd like to use the apples as a pancake topping, saute the spiralized apple in a little butter and maple syrup. Make an apple tart or crumble. Instead of peeling, coring and slicing apples for dessert, use spiralized apples. Toss several spiralized apples with cornstarch, spices, and sugar. Place these in a pastry shell or tart pan. Cover the apples with another layer of pastry or sprinkle a crumble topping on them. Bake the tart or crumble until the top is golden brown and the spiralized apples are bubbling. Don't worry about peeling the apples since the small strings of apple will cook down. Top salads with spiralized apples. Add a little flavor to your salads by including something sweet. Scatter spiralized apples over most savory salads to get a slightly sweet crunch. Try spiralized apples on:\nKale or green leaf salad. Chicken salad. Tuna salad. Coleslaw. Spinach and noodle salad. Stir spiralized apples into yogurt or oatmeal. If you try to eat healthy breakfasts but want to add more fruit, spiralize an apple and place it on your morning oatmeal or yogurt. The apples will give a slight crunch and a little sweetness. You can also mix the spiralized apples into granola for a quick snack.",
