Both can be used as a base for cross hatching. Regardless of which hatching type you use, the lines do not cross over one another in standard hatching. You should also try to keep your lines equally spaced out for seamless, smooth shading. With parallel hatching, your lines should remain straight and run vertically or horizontally. With contour hatching, your lines should follow the contour of the outline you\u2019re shading. When you add basic hatching to your drawing, you'll use this skill to draw parallel lines over the area you wish to shade. Practice this by drawing a series of hatching lines on a piece of scrap paper."

This second layer of hatch marks should cross over the first in perpendicular or near-perpendicular directions. The lines of the second layer should not cross over one another, though. Your cross hatch marks should match the hatch mark type used in your base layer. For example, if you started with parallel hatch marks, your cross hatch marks should also be parallel. Practice this by adding a set of cross hatching lines over your hatching."

You can also layer additional series of cross hatching lines to make that area appear darker and more heavily shaded. Alternate directions when adding layers of cross hatching lines. For example, start with a set of vertical lines, then a horizontal set, then a diagonal set, then an opposite diagonal set. This will allow you to build up a deeper, darker shadow effect."

          "description":"Before adding any hatch marks, take a moment to look at the object and examine how the light source hits the object and reflect off its surface. This will help you figure out which areas of the drawing should have the lightest shading and which areas need heavier shading. If you\u2019re drawing from imagination, try to imagine how the light would fall or find a similar object to examine. Note that the absolute lightest sections will have no hatch or cross hatch marks. Your imaginary light source would hit these areas directly, so they shouldn't have any shadows. Areas and surfaces further away from your imaginary light source should be darker and will require more cross hatching. If you have trouble imagining a light source and the shadows it would cast, find a photograph of a simple object lit by a single light source. Note where the light and shadows fall, and practice copying this effect with cross hatching."

Keep the hatch marks in each section parallel to one another, even if they curve along the contours of the outline. For this step, use a pencil and press lightly. This way, you can easily erase these lines if needed. Place more hatch marks closer together in sections that need heavier shading. For sections that need lighter shade, space the hatch marks further apart and use fewer hatch marks overall. The base hatch marks should indicate which areas are darker than others even before you add the cross hatching.

Kelly Medford\t\t\tPlein Air Painter\t\t\t\tWhat Our Expert Does: \"Cross hatching is most effective when you think about the lines following the plane of the object you're shading. For example, is something I'm sketching is round, I would make rounded lines that follow the contour of the object. Or if I were sketching a box, I would use lines going in different directions for the side, top, and bottom planes.\""

When working with a nibbed pen, dip it in the ink, then draw a line on a separate piece of scrap paper before moving to your drawing. This allows you to unload some of the excess ink and prevents it from bleeding onto the drawing itself. Go over the outline of the drawing first, then work on tracing each section of cross hatch marks. Work carefully and try to follow your previously created marks as closely as possible. You can add additional cross hatch marks as needed, but try not to get carried away since you won't be able to undo any of the marks you make in this step. Note that any pencil marks that are still visible after inking might make the drawing look darker than the final piece will look, so don't worry too much if the overall drawing looks darker than anticipated right now."

Whether you use a pencil or pen, make sure it\u2019s sharp or fine-tipped in order to make your lines precise. Even if you want the final drawing to be inked, it's still a good idea to start the drawing with pencil. Use a drawing pencil, mechanical pencil, or a sharpened standard number two pencil.

Draw 4 identical 1 in (2.5 cm) squares in a line, then fill each box in with different values, going from light to dark. Use techniques such as varying density and adding sets of lines to gradually move from lightest to darkest. This will help you practice creating subtle differences in value. Use a pencil and some scratch paper for this exercise. As you draw, refer to this scale to determine your desired value range. For example, you could select one value box on your scale to be the darkest value in your drawing. Use your scale to compare with the drawing and make sure you don\u2019t go darker."
