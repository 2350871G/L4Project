Once the skin has been removed, slice lengthwise into the mango until you feel resistance from the seed. Repeat this process on the other side of the mango, and then carve around the seed to remove as much of the mango meat at you can. The actual fruit of the mango will be really easy to cut, and your knife should slice through it easily. If you feel resistance or are struggling to cut through the mango, you\u2019re most likely hitting the seed.
