Because the candy has the texture of gummy bears, you may want to use bear-shaped molds. If you don\u2019t have candy molds, you can pour the mixture into a baking sheet that\u2019s lined with plastic wrap and cut it with a knife or cookie cutters after it\u2019s set. When using molds, it helps to place them on baking sheets before filling them. That makes it easier to carry the candy to the fridge without spilling the mixture.

    "When the mixture comes to a boil, place a candy thermometer in the pan.",
    "Allow the mixture to cook until it reaches the right temperature without stirring it at all.",
    "Pour the hot sugar mixture into the gelatin mixture.",

    "Stir the two together well, and set aside.",
    "Unmold the candy and cut it into strips.",
    "Lightly dust a cutting board or countertop with powdered sugar to prevent sticking.",
    "Peel up a corner of the candy block to pull it out of the dish and onto your work surface, and turn the block over so both sides are coated with the powdered sugar.",
    "Use a sharp knife to cut the candy into a dozen \u00bd-inch (13-mm) strips and then cut each strip into 5 pieces that are approximately 1 \u00bc- inch (3-cm) long.",
    "Toss the candy in the citric acid mixture.",
    "Drop the candy into the bowl with the citric acid and sugar mixture, and use a fork to stir them around until they\u2019re well coated.",
    "If the candy begins to get sticky, toss it in the cornstarch mixture first and then into the citric acid mixture.",
    "Let the candy dry until the coating hardens.",
    "Place the coated candy pieces on a wire cooling rack, and allow them to dry until the coating is crunchy and hard.",
    "It should take approximately 8 hours.",
    "Store the candy in an airtight container.",
