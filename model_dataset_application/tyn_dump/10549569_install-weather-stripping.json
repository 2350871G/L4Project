          "description":"The 3 most common types of adhesive weather stripping are foam, V strip, and rubber or vinyl. Adhesive-backed foam tape is the most popular, as it\u2019s the easiest to install, but if you have a draftier door frame, you might prefer vinyl. Consider the specifics of your door or window when choosing your weather stripping. V strip may also be labeled as \u201ctension seal.\u201d\nYou can find adhesive weather stripping at a hardware store or online retailer. Buy as much weather stripping as you need based on your measurements, plus 10% extra as a precaution. For example, if you need 96 inches (240 cm) for your window, buy 106 inches (270 cm) of stripping. How to Choose a Type of Weather Stripping\nFor the cheapest and easiest solution, go with foam tape. It costs less than $1 per 1 ft (0.30 m). If you don't want to be able to see the weather stripping, choose V strip. It's nearly invisible when installed correctly! For old doors or windows that have large gaps, use rubber or vinyl weather stripping. The tubular pieces seal up cracks better."

If you\u2019re weather stripping a window, you\u2019ll need 4 pieces, 1 for the top, 1 for the bottom, and 1 for each side. To weather strip a door, you need 1 piece for the top and 1 piece for each side, for a total of 3 strips. The bottom of the door will require a door sweep."

Install the weather stripping when the outside temperature is at least 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) to help the adhesive hold better. If you\u2019re using V strip, place the stripping against the frame so that the opening of the V faces towards the exterior of the door or window. Do not put the weather stripping on the door itself."

Run your hands along the piece and apply pressure to secure the sticky side of the stripping to the door or window jamb. To prevent the stripping from sticking to things it shouldn\u2019t, peel a little bit of backing off at a time as you go, instead of removing it all at once. For extra protection, you can secure the stripping into place by hammering nails through it into the frame, or use a staple gun to insert heavy-duty staples into it."

Repeat these pushing strokes until the saw cuts through the sweep. Always wear safety glasses when cutting with a saw to protect your eyes from debris. Tips for Cutting with a Hacksaw\nChoose the right blade. Make sure your hacksaw is fitted with a blade that works on metal, not one that\u2019s just for wood. Push, don't pull. Hacksaws only cut on the push stroke, so you don\u2019t need to pull it back through the sweep. Instead, you can lift it up and bring it back to the starting position."

    "If you're having significant trouble opening or closing the window or door, adjust your weather stripping as necessary.",
    "Adding a Door Sweep Measure the bottom of the door frame.",
    "Place one end of a tape measure on the inner edge of 1 side of the door frame.",
    "Pull the measure taut along the ground to the inner edge of the other side.",
    "Note what the measurement is.",
    "This is how long you\u2019ll need to cut the door sweep.",
    "Jot the measurement down on a piece of paper or type it in the notes app on your phone so you don\u2019t forget it.",
    "Cut the metal door sweep to the right length with a hacksaw.",
    "Mark the length you measured on the door sweep with a pencil or marker.",
    "Clamp the sweep to a work table with the section you\u2019re going to cut hanging off the edge of the table.",
    "Apply pressure as you push the saw against the sweep and away from you.",
    "Repeat these pushing strokes until the saw cuts through the sweep.",
    "Always wear safety glasses when cutting with a saw to protect your eyes from debris.",
    "Tips for Cutting with a Hacksaw\nChoose the right blade.",
    "Make sure your hacksaw is fitted with a blade that works on metal, not one that\u2019s just for wood.",
    "Push, don't pull.",
    "Hacksaws only cut on the push stroke, so you don\u2019t need to pull it back through the sweep.",
    "Instead, you can lift it up and bring it back to the starting position.",
    "Place the sweep at the bottom of the inside of the door.",
    "Position it so that the flexible bottom piece of the sweep just grazes the floor.",
    "This will seal the gap underneath the door while also preventing the sweep from dragging against the floor when you open and close the door.",
    "You can check that your door sweep is aligned properly by looking underneath the door.",
    "If you can see light coming through, move the sweep down a little until all of the light is blocked.",
    "Mark spots for the screws on the sweep and pre-drill pilot holes.",
    "Use a pencil to make a mark where each of the provided screws will go along the door sweep, spacing out the pilot holes evenly in a straight line.",
    "For example, if you have 3 screws, make 1 hole on each side of the sweep and then 1 in the center.",
    "Line up the drill bit with the marks and pull the trigger to drill through both the sweep and the door itself.",
    "Your door sweep should come with 3 to 4 screws.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t, you can use any #6 screws.",
    "For #6 screws, use a drill bit that\u2019s at least \u204432 inch (0.24 cm) in diameter.",
    "Use a screwdriver to insert the screws into the holes.",
    "Place 1 screw in each of the holes and tighten them with a screwdriver until they\u2019re completely secure.",
    "This will secure the sweep to the door so it won\u2019t hang off or come loose.",
    "Test the door by opening and closing it a few times.",
    "If you notice the sweep is getting stuck, unscrew it from the door and adjust it as needed.",
    "Putting Weather Stripping on a Car Door Remove any old weather stripping that\u2019s already on the door.",
    "Use your hands to carefully peel off the piece that is currently on your car door.",
    "Make sure to pull up what you can of the adhesive layer underneath the stripping, too.",
    "There may be screws in the stripping, which holds it in place.",
    "Unscrew them and set them aside.",
    "If you\u2019re having trouble peeling off the current piece, apply adhesive remover to it and let it soften for 15 to 20 minutes before trying again.",
    "Use brake cleaner to clear out the channel, then dry it with a towel.",
    "This will get rid of any remaining adhesive residue or dirt in the channel before you place the new stripping down.",
    "Hold the can about 2 feet (0.61 m) from the door jamb and spray it along the channel.",
    "Wipe it off with a clean towel to remove any debris.",
    "If you have sensitive skin, wear rubber gloves when using brake cleaner.",
    "Apply a thin line of weather stripping adhesive along the channel.",
    "Less is more when it comes to the adhesive.",
    "Squeeze the tube to lay a bead of glue down the groove where you\u2019ll place the weather stripping.",
    "You can buy weather stripping adhesive from an auto parts store or an online retailer.",
    "Purchase generic or custom weather stripping based on your preferences.",
    "While you can buy generic weather stripping at any auto parts store, you can also get a piece that\u2019s specifically designed to match your car\u2019s make and model from the service department at your dealership.",
    "Custom stripping is more guaranteed to seal tightly around your car doors.",
    "If you aren't sure what to use, call your dealership or an auto technician and ask their opinion.",
    "Custom weather stripping will be more expensive than generic stripping.",
    "Place the new piece in the channel, pressing it firmly onto the adhesive.",
    "Line up the new weather stripping in the groove around the door.",
    "Push down on the stripping once it\u2019s aligned so that the adhesive holds it in place.",
    "If you notice any spots where the adhesive oozed out and hardened, use the brake cleaner to wipe them away\nIf you had to remove any studs when you peeled off the old weather stripping, screw those back into their proper places once you lay down the new piece.",
    "Let the adhesive dry for 45 minutes before closing the door.",
    "After the glue is completely dry, you can shut your car door.",
    "However, keep in mind it will be harder to close at first because of the new rubber.",
    "To make your new weather stripping last longer, you can spray it with a rubber seal protectant after the adhesive has dried.",
    "You can also spray silicone on the weather stripping to prevent ice and snow from sticking to it in the winter."
