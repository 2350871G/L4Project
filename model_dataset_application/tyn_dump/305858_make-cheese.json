    "Wait 40 minutes for the curds to settle to the bottom of the pot.",
    "Then, pour the mixture into a colander lined with cheesecloth.",
    "If done correctly, the curds will come out in 1 big lump.",
    "Rest the curds for 45 minutes, flipping them every 10-15 minutes.",
    "Let the curds drain, then return them to the pot.",
    "Cut the lump of curds in half, then flip over each half, put the lid on, and let them rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Flip them over and let them rest for another 10 minutes.",
    "Flip them again and let them rest for 10 minutes, then flip them a final time and let them rest for 15 minutes.",
    "Aim to keep the temperature at 102 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C).Did You Know?",
    "This is known as the \u201ccheddaring\u201d process and is important for removing excess whey from the curd to make the cheese firmer.",
    "It gets its name from the village of Cheddar in Somerset, England, where cheddar cheese was first made.",
    "Drain the curd, cut it into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) cubes, then mill the curds.",
    "Drain the whey through a fresh cheesecloth into a colander.",
    "Transfer the curd to a cutting board and slice it into cubes.",
    "Then, use your hands to break each curd in half (called milling) and put them back in the pot.",
    "Mix in 1\u00bd tbsp (25.5 g) of cheese salt and transfer the curd to a cheese basket.",
    "Sprinkle the salt evenly over the curds, then use your hands to thoroughly mix it in.",
    "Next, line a cheese basket with a fresh piece of cheesecloth.",
    "Transfer the curds to the basket, cover them with the overhanging cheesecloth, and press the follower (lid) on top.",
    "Be sure to use \"cheese salt,\" which is non-iodized.",
    "Press the cheese at 24 pounds (11 kg) for 1 hour.",
    "Set the cheese press to the correct weight and let it sit for an hour.",
    "If you don't have a cheese press, just put the right amount of weight on top of the cheese to help form it.",
    "Allow the cheese to drain freely so any excess whey can be removed.",
    "Pressing the cheese forms it into a dense wheel.",
    "Flip the cheese and press it at 50 pounds (23 kg) for 12 hours.",
    "Unscrew the press, remove the former, and take the cheesecloth and cheese out of the press.",
    "Carefully flip the cheese over, wrap it back up in the cheesecloth, and put it back in the press.",
    "Let it sit for 12 hours at 50 pounds (23 kg) to firm up.",
    "Check the pressure and retighten the spring after 6 hours, if necessary.",
    "Air-dry the cheese for 2-3 days, turning it twice per day.",
    "Remove the cheese from the press and unwrap it.",
    "Let it dry in a clean area where it won't be disturbed.",
    "The cheese will turn yellow as time passes.",
    "Cloth-band the cheese.",
    "Cut 2 squares and 1 rectangle out of loose-weave cheesecloth.",
    "Coat the cheese with coconut oil.",
    "Then, wrap the rectangular piece around the circumference of the cheese, adding more oil to make the cloth stick to the cheese as necessary.",
    "Trim away any excess cheesecloth, then put the 2 square pieces on the top and bottom of the cheese.",
    "Dip your hands in the coconut oil and use them to secure and smooth out the cheesecloth.",
    "You can use lard in place of coconut oil.",
    "Using a cloth band instead of wax makes the cheese more flavorful.",
    "Age the cheese for at least 3 months at 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C).",
    "Be sure to rotate the cheese each week.",
    "If you want a sharper cheddar, let the cheese age longer.",
    "As cheese ages, the lactose continues to break down into lactic acid, which results in a more sour flavor."
