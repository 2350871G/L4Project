Make sure your scissors are strong and sharp in order to cut through that many layers. If they\u2019re too dull, they\u2019ll mangle the paper and make rough cuts. Cut a 18 in (46 cm) piece of floral wire for the stem. Fold the piece of wire in half and slip it over the center of the tissue paper, then tightly twist it closed. Trim the wire as needed or wrap it in green floral tape. Floral wire works well and looks nice, but you can also use a pipe cleaner to make a stem. Spread out the petals one layer at a time.

If you want to suspend the flower, such as with string from the ceiling, fluff out both sides evenly. Leave some space for the center on both sides. Decorate with your paper flower. Arrange the flowers as decorations for parties such as garden parties, birthday parties for young girls, baby showers, and bridal showers. To suspend the flowers, tie a length of monofilament to the floral wire and hang from the ceiling. Crafting a Tissue Paper Rose Select one or two colors of tissue paper. If you want a simple, classic look, choose one sheet of in pink, red, or coral. For a two-toned rose, grab an additional sheet in a different shade. Some combinations that really pop are pink and ruby or orange and tangerine. Cut one or two 3.5 to 4 in (8.9 to 10.2 cm) strips of tissue paper. For the main petals, cut a single 3.5 to 4 inches (8.9 to 10.2 cm) strip down the length of the tissue paper. Cut another 3.5 to 4 in (8.9 to 10.2 cm) strip for an optional accent color. Fold the two strips in half together. Place the accent color strip on top of the main strip and fold both strips in half, with the accent color inside the fold. Then accordion fold the strips together, folding in alternate directions every 1 in (2.5 cm) or so. Use scissors to scallop one side of the folded strip. Take a sharp pair of scissors and round one of the ends of the folded strip of tissue paper--the selvage end. This will create a petal shape. When you finish, gently unfold the accordion-folded strip and lay it out, petals right side up. Cut a 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) piece of floral wire for a stem. Once you\u2019ve created your stem, you can trim the floral wire as needed. Place adhesive on the edge of the tissue strip. Glue dots work best for this because they\u2019re more precise and create less mess, but you can also use hot glue or craft glue. Make sure the adhesive is close to the edge, where the stem will come in contact with the petal strip. Wrap the tissue paper around the floral wire. Lay the floral wire stem on the adhesive, then begin wrapping the tissue paper strip tightly. Firmly the base of the flower as you wrap, gathering up any slack. Gradually loosen your wrapping to create a blooming effect. Secure the slack at the bottom with a 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) strip of floral tape. Wind the tape around the flower base several times, then keep wrapping diagonally down the stem. Make sure you\u2019re wrapping the tape tightly enough to hold the tissue paper rose together. Separate and spread out the petals. Arrange your rose\u2019s petals by gently separating the layers and spreading them outwards. This will help fill out your flower and make it look more realistic. Making Tissue Paper Hydrangeas Choose several sheets of colored tissue paper for your flower. If you want a classic hydrangea color, go for light blue, lavender, pale green, or pink. You could also select some green tissue paper if you want to make leaves. Cut out 120 teardrop-shaped petals. Fold your sheets of tissue paper until they make an inch-wide stack. Then use a sharp pair of scissors to cut out a teardrop shape for the petals. You\u2019ll need around 120 petals to fill out the flower. You can make the petals any size you want, but 1 in (2.5 cm) wide is generally a realistic size. Cut and bundle 30 pieces of floral wire to make the flower\u2019s base. Cut your wire pieces at 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) and bundle them together neatly. Wrap the bundle with floral tape about 2 in (5.1 cm) from the top of the wire. Spread out the wires at the top. The side wires should stick out perpendicular to the bundle, while the others should be spread out evenly. Hot-glue the petals to the wires. Start by hot-gluing two petals to a wire and then make a small loop at the end of the wire. Hot-glue the center, then add more petals to fill out the flower and hide the loop. Continue doing this for all of the wires until the flower is complete. You can also double up petals for more fullness. Cover as much of the wire with petals as possible--add extra petals in spots where the wire peeks through. If you made leaves, glue those to the base of the stem. Fluff up the petals. With hydrangeas, you shouldn\u2019t separate the petals too much, but try to separate the petals a bit and move the ends around after the glue has dried. This will make the flower appear fuller and more natural.",
