Stir the garlic and the \u20442 cup (120 ml) of olive oil together so the garlic is evenly distributed in the pan. You don\u2019t need to peel the garlic before putting it in the press. The peel will stay in the press while you squeeze it. Substitute other oils for the olive oil based on your personal preferences. How to Choose a Type of Oil\nIf you\u2019re only using it for cooking, go with a neutral oil that can handle high temperatures, like canola, vegetable, or grapeseed oil. For a heart-healthy oil, choose extra-virgin olive oil or avocado oil, thanks to their monounsaturated fat content. If you want a unique flavor, try sesame oil. It\u2019s one of the strongest oils and you\u2019ll get a nice, nutty flavor."

If you don\u2019t want tiny bits of garlic in your oil, you can strain it through a colander or sieve as you pour the mixture into the container.

It can cause botulism, which is a sometimes fatal form of food poisoning most often found in preserved food. Freeze the garlic oil for up to 1 year if you want it to last longer."
