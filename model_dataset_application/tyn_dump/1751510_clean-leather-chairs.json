Look to see if there are any tags attached to your furniture. If you don't find any, look at the written material that came with your furniture when you purchased it. If you know the specific type of chair you own, you may be able to find manufacturer's instructions online. The tag or instructions will provide tips on cleaning your furniture. It will also let you know what products could be potentially harmful to your leather. If you're unable to determine the specific type of leather, keep in mind most leather furniture is made from top-coat protected leather. It is generally safe to clean this leather using mild body soap and water."

          "description":"Before you begin cleaning your furniture, give it a good vacuuming. Regular vacuuming can prevent wear and tear on leather furniture. For best results, use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment. Run the vacuum over the chair, making sure to get into dust between the cushions and in any cracks or crevices. Once you finish, wipe the chair down with a cloth. Use either a cotton or microfiber cloth. Keep an eye out for problem areas when vacuuming and dusting. Later on, you can treat any stains you find with soap or other cleaning products."

Soaps you would use in the shower work well as long as they're of a mild variety. If possible, use distilled water over tap water. Tap water may contain trace amounts of contaminants such as chlorine, which can cause damage to leather. Mix the water and soap together until suds form at the surface."

From there, wipe the chair down with the wet rag. Once you finish applying the water and soap mixture, get another rag. Soak it with only distilled water and then ring it out. Repeat the process with this rag. Take a third rag and use it to dry off the chair."

Then, rub it into the leather until it has a nice shine. Be very careful not to use too much olive oil. This can make leather look greasy. If your chair looks darker after conditioning, you've used too much oil. Try to use less next time."

If the stain remains after you attempt to wipe it away, sprinkle baking soda on the affected area. Baking soda can help draw out the grease.

Dab some rubbing alcohol onto it. Wipe at the stain until it clears away. This method may also help in removing mold or mildew from a leather chair."

A mixture of cream of tartar and lemon juice can be used to remove these types of stains. Make a mixture of equal parts lemon juice and cream of tartar. How much you'll need depends on the size of the stains you're removing. Mix until you have a paste. Apply the paste to the stained areas. Leave on for 10 minutes.

Then, dab onto the leather with a soft cleaning cloth, using circular motions to apply. Let sit for 10 minutes before buffing the chair with a dry cloth until it shines."
