Keep the guest list to 5-7 people, or even fewer, for a smaller affair. Don\u2019t worry\u2014just because you have a smaller party, doesn\u2019t mean you have to ditch the fancy decorations and dress code, if you want them. A smaller party lets you save money on food, and you won\u2019t have to worry about entertaining lots of people."

Invite people from different friend groups to encourage interesting conversations and connections. A big, diverse group can make for a more lavish-feeling party, which goes perfectly with the Oscars theme. Depending on how large your house or venue is, you can go even larger than 15 people.

If you want an even fancier feel, you could choose to rent out a room. You might rent a space, like a ballroom or large meeting room, at a hotel or community center. Using an outside venue will give the party a more formal and less personal feeling, but is great if you\u2019re looking to invite a big crowd of 50 or more guests.

Be flexible, follow the mood of the party, and keep having fun! Look for movie-related games, like Scene It? or Double Feature, and set out old favorites like Monopoly, Clue, or Scrabble. Set up the games away from the TV, so guests who still want to watch aren\u2019t too distracted. Hand out \u201cOscars\u201d to the winners of your games.
