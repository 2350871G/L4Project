Using different-sized specimens will therefore make it harder to achieve a consistent texture. You can boil beets of any size. However, medium-sized beets tend to work best, as they offer the best balance between heartiness and cook time. Pass up beets with noticeable bruises or blemishes or dry, wrinkly-looking skin. These are usually indications that they\u2019re past their prime."

Leave about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the stalk intact to avoid cutting into the beetroot itself. Raw beets can be tough, which means you may need to apply quite a bit of pressure to get your knife all the way through. Be sure to watch your fingers! If you like, you can save your beet greens and use them in other dishes. Beet greens can be prepared much like spinach, kale, collards, and other greens."

Make your cut right around the point where the bulbs taper so as not to waste any of the juicy, nutritious meat. You can skip this step if your beets came pre-trimmed. This part of the beet is technically edible, though it isn't very good on its own due to its tough, stringy texture. However, it could make a flavorful addition to a homemade vegetable stock.Tip: If you happen to get beet juice on your cutting board, slice a fresh lemon in half and rub the cut side into the discolored area vigorously. Together, the friction and acid will help lift out the pigment and keep it from leaving a permanent stain."

Place the clean beets in a bowl, or set them on a layer of folded paper towels or another sanitary surface. Try not to scrub your beets too hard. Damaging the skin could cause some of their color, flavor, and nutrient contents to leach out into the boiling water.

If you're a stickler for cleanliness, you can also soak your beets in a bowl full of water for around 5 minutes. Add \u20444 cup (59 mL) of vinegar or lemon juice to help kill bacteria."

For larger batches, you\u2019ll need to upsize to a medium-sized pot, stockpot, or Dutch oven to make sure there's enough room for all of the beets you're preparing.

Double the amount of acid you add for every additional \u20442 gallon (1.9 L) of water in your pot.Tip: If you decide to use vinegar, ordinary distilled white vinegar is your best bet.

Let the beets simmer at this decreased heat setting for around half an hour, or until they reach the desired doneness. Come back and give your beets a stir periodically to keep the heat evenly distributed throughout your pot. Be sure to leave the lid on the pot the whole time it\u2019s on the stove. Otherwise, the temperature of the water will drop and your cook time will increase. Especially large beets or those that have been in cold storage may need closer to an hour to cook all the way through."

If it pierces easily, it\u2019s time for them to come off of the stove. If it still feels tough, leave them on the stove for another 10-15 minutes to soften them up. Choose a knife with a long blade to avoid burning your hand. It may also be a good idea to slip on an oven mitt if there\u2019s a lot of steam escaping from the pot."

The drastic change in temperature will also loosen up the connection between the skin and the meat, making them a breeze to peel. You may need to chill your beets in batches, depending on the quantity you\u2019ve cooked. Be sure to refill your bowl with fresh water and ice after each batch."
