Pushing the clog further in may end up making the problem worse, as eventually it can get so deep that you can no longer reach it. Always make sure to sanitize your snake after each use.

As an added bonus, your latrine will be sparkly clean, sanitized and ready for use afterwards. Only use cleaners that are intended for toilets. Regular drain cleaners can eat through galvanized plumbing pipes and wreak havoc on septic systems. A homemade declogging solution made from vinegar and baking soda can also work wonders on clearing out your pipes after they've been snaked. Simply pour about a cup of baking soda into the bowl, add two cups of vinegar (gradually, so that the mixture doesn't bubble over into the floor), wait ten minutes and flush."
