Dormant pruning is pruning the tree during the late winter, when no new growth is happening and the tree doesn't have any leaves. Pruning while the tree is dormant encourages vibrant growth come spring, and it's less likely to cause damage to the tree than summer pruning. Summer pruning can be used to slow the growth of a tree that is getting too big and to thin new growth that is overcrowding. Prune as late in the winter as possible before new growth occurs, since heavy freezes after pruning could damage the tree. Save some pruning for the summer. Pruning too much in late winter can lead to vegetative overgrowth and reduced fruit production."

As soon as possible after planting, cut it down so that it's only about 30 inches (76.2 cm) high. Make the cut just above a bud. New growth will occur where you make each cut. Use loppers to make clean, sharp cuts. Gouges and jagged edges leave the tree vulnerable to pests and disease. After this first pruning, you might wish to paint the tree with white latex paint to keep it from getting sunburned and protect it from pests."
