However, many people have complained that the light sensors activate even when the sun goes behind a tree or cloud.

A transformer is a small device that converts the high voltage power (120 V or 230 V, depending on your location) from your electric main to a lower voltage (usually 12 volts). There are many different varieties, so it is important to do your research. Some transformers have sensors that detect sunlight so that they automatically come on at dusk.

Transformers are installed simply by plugging them into your outdoor outlet, though some larger ones must be mounted on the wall.
