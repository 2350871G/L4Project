Look for a rake that has an ergonomic handle and that is lightweight. This will help to reduce the strain on your back. Choosing a rake that has a wide end will also help to ensure that you can rake up as many leaves a possible with every sweep."

When you hold the rake, grasp it with both hands and change your hand positions now and then as you rake. Your knees. Keep your knees slightly bent. Try not to bend too far forward at the waist. Your movement. It is helpful to move backwards as you rake. Try to rake the leaves towards you as you walk backwards."

Before you begin raking, lay out a tarp or other large piece of material on the ground. Then, begin raking the leaves onto the tarp. Rake one area of your yard until the tarp is full, then drag the tarp to your main pile. If you prefer, you can also rake your leaves directly into bags. Then, you can transport the bags to a mulch pile or other disposal area."

To stomp on your leaves, simply step on them or put one foot into the leaf bag to stomp them down. If you are using bags, just try to avoid filling the bags too full. You should still be able to pick the bags up easily."

If there are more leaves on the trees, then more leaves will fall. Watch the trees to determine when they are mostly or completely bare. Then, start your raking. If you have extra time on your hands, then you can also rake up the leaves as they begin to fall instead of waiting for all of them to fall.

They will also weigh down the bags or other containers that you put them in, which will make it harder for you to move them. To make your job a little easier, wait until the leaves are dry to start raking them. Watch the weather and check the leaves before you get started."
