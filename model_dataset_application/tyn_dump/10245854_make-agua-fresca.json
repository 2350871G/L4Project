You can also cut the watermelon into rounds, cut off the rind, and then slice it up into pieces from there. Alternatively, if you would rather make cantaloupe agua fresca, you can slice a cantaloupe in half and remove the seeds from one half. Then, chop it into chunks and throw them into the blender."
