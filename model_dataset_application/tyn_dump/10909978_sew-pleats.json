          "description":"Before you begin measuring and marking pleats on your fabric, make sure you have left enough fabric to create the pleats. Otherwise, you may reduce the size of your item to the point where it will not fit. To add pleats into a pattern that does not include them, determine how many pleats you want to add and how wide each of the pleats will be. Then, multiply the number of pleats by the width of each of the pleats and add this to your total fabric length. For example, if you want to add 4 pleats that are 3 in (7.6 cm) wide each, then you would need to add 12 in (30 cm) of fabric to the total length. If you are following a pattern that includes pleats, then it will have already taken this into account."

It is important to use chalk or a fabric marker to avoid permanently marking your fabric. You can position the pleats anywhere on the fabric that you would like them to go, but always position the pleats so they are going straight down from the top edge of the fabric. Draw a second parallel line 3 in (7.6 cm) from the first. A standard-sized inverted or box pleat is 3 in (7.6 cm), but you can make your pleats wider or narrower if you prefer. Measure from the edge of the first line you drew to the desired width of the pleat. Then, draw a line that is parallel to the first line you drew. If you want to make knife pleats, then this is the only other line you need to make to complete 1 pleat. Mark the center of the 2 lines and draw a line between them for inverted or box pleats. To create inverted or box pleats, mark the point in the center of the 2 parallel lines. Then, draw a third line that goes between them. Ensure that this line is also parallel to the first 2 lines. This line will serve as a guide for folding the other 2 sections of fabric in to create a pleat. Continue to mark your fabric where you want the pleats to go. Repeat the process of measuring and marking as many times as needed to create the desired amount of pleats. You can make as many pleats as you have accounted for in your fabric cut. Do not add or leave out any pleats to a pattern or you may end up with an ill-fitting item. Folding the Fabric Pinch the top edge of the fabric along the first line you drew. Find the first line in your row of parallel pleat lines. Pinch the fabric along the line at the top of the fabric with 1 hand.
