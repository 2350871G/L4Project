Then, squirt a few drops of dish soap into your warm water and mix it for 10-15 seconds with a spoon. Read the soap\u2019s label before you use it to make sure that it\u2019s free of phosphates, which tend to be too abrasive for gold."

          "description":"Delicately drop your object into the bowl and let it rest for at least 15 minutes. This will loosen the dirt and grime that is tarnishing it and make it easy to wipe off. If you happen to be cleaning jewelry with stones that are glued into it, you may run the risk of dissolving the glue if you leave your jewelry submerged for more than a few minutes."

Use a calm back-and-forth motion to brush along the surface. Refrain from brushing aggressively, or you\u2019ll risk damaging it. A toothbrush is excellent for reaching small crevices or openings in your gold, but you can also use a standard soft-bristle brush."

Then, run your gold under some warm water and rub each section between your thumb and forefinger. Do this twice to ensure that each section comes in contact with the water. The residue left by soap will make gold look dirty if you don\u2019t remove it."

Pick up an edge of the same cloth with your dominant hand and use your thumb and forefinger to carefully buff each piece of the gold by keeping the cloth between your fingers and the gold. Water spots will stick around if you don\u2019t wipe them by hand. Store gold jewelry in a jewelry container after you\u2019re done."
