Low levels of critical soil nutrients, especially nitrogen and trace minerals/elements like zinc, iron, and manganese can substantially reduce the quality of the nuts. Insect infestations such as web worms, bud worms, and pecan weevils can also have a serious impact on the health of the tree and the nut itself.
