  "text":" Wall Decoration Gather your supplies. The list is located at the bottom of the article. Cut the card stock papers into 4 inch squares. You will need around 50 to 60 squares to make one dahlia. Use a paper trimmer to make this job easier. If you don't have one, a simple ruler and scissors will do the job. Pour a small amount of paint into a palette and dip your sponge in it. Dab the sponge around two corners of each squares as shown. This is done to create a two color dahlia. Dabbing gives a natural look compared to just painting the corners. If you don't have a sponge, use dry brush to create that effect. Allow them to dry. Wait for it to dry overnight, then come back to it in the morning. Lightly dab your finger in a small area of the paint. If no paint comes off on your finger, it is sufficiently dry. Apply a line of glue to top right corner of the square as shown.  Fold the left side of the square to the center and wrap the right side of the square over it to make a cone shape.  Repeat the same to all the squares. Make around 50 cones to start making the dahlia. You can always make extra if you want. Use the plastic plate as the base. The plate used in the images above was 9 inches (22.86 cm) in diameter. If you don't have a plate, you can also cut a piece of cardboard to use as a base. Apply a line of glue on the back side of the cone. A plate is preferred to use than cardboard. The reason is that while hanging the flowers on the wall, the plate gives a three dimensional effect as if the flower is popping out from the wall instead just pasted on the wall. But it is your choice to decide which one to use. Paste the cone on the back side of the plate leaving a one inch gap between each cone you paste.  Dab the glue in a V shape to the back of each cone.  Glue it in between two cones of the first layer so that it sticks nicely.
