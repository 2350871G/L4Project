    "Next, grease it's surface with cooking spray, oil, or butter.",
    "If you used oil or butter, be sure to wipe most of it off with a paper towel.",
    "This will keep your pancakes from turning greasy and splotchy.",
    "Pour some pancake batter onto the skillet.",
    "Plan on using about \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of batter.",
    "These types of pancakes are meant to be thin, but you can make them thicker if you want to.",
    "Use a soup ladle to make the pouring easier.",
    "Wait until bubbles form to flip the pancake.",
    "Once the edges of the pancake turn dry and the bubbles pop, use a spatula to loosen the edges.",
    "Carefully slide the spatula under the pancake, then flip it over.",
    "These pancakes are delicate compared to other types.",
    "Don't worry if your first few don't turn out perfect.",
    "Cook the pancake for 1 to 2 more minutes.",
    "It's ready when it's a golden color on both slides.",
    "Use a spatula to slide the pancake off of the pan and onto a plate.",
    "Continue making pancakes until you run out of batter.",
    "You have enough batter to make around 15 pancakes.",
    "How much you actually end up making also depends on the size and thickness of the pancakes.",
    "Re-grease the pan after every couple of pancakes.",
    "Remember to wipe any excess oil or butter off.",
    "Serve the pancakes.",
    "They taste delicious with syrup, Greek yogurt, and fresh blueberries.",
    "You can also use lemon curd instead."
