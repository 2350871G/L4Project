Most doors require a minimum of two hinges: one hinge is located 7-inches from the top of the door frame, and the other hinge is located 11-inches from the bottom of the door frame. Measure this distance and mark the location on the frame, and then do the same on the door that you're hanging. If you have a third hinge (typically used for heavy doors), it will be placed directly in the middle of the other two hinges (this will put it slightly off-center)."

          "description":"The term 'cut the mortise' is the professional term for cutting out the wood in the jamb in the shape of the hinge, so that the hinge will be inset in the jamb and provide more strength and aesthetic appeal. To cut the mortise, you'll need a very sharp chisel and a hammer. While carefully angling the chisel, tap gently into the jamb from the side to remove thin strips of wood. Make sure not to cut the mortise too deep, as this will cause the hinge to become loose over time. Cut out only the outlined area and the marked depth. Using a dull chisel will make it more difficult to cut the mortise, and cause you to use more pressure with the hammer (which could cause a slip). If you cut the mortise too deep, you can use wood filler or place a thin piece of wood in it before installing the hinge."
