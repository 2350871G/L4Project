Transferring Photos with Nail Polish Remover Put a printed photo face-down on the piece of wood. Print the picture on regular paper with a laser or HP printer. Make sure the photo is the same size as the piece of wood you\u2019re using. If the photo has words on it, flip it horizontally on your computer so the words read the right way once it\u2019s transferred. Wet a cotton ball with nail polish remover and rub the back of the picture. Dip the cotton ball in the nail polish and rub it back and forth across the picture. The paper will become slightly transparent so you can see the picture on the other side. Coat the entire picture with the remover. Use makeup cleaning pads instead of cotton balls to cover more surface area. Press the photo onto the wood with the back of a spoon. As soon as you\u2019ve applied the nail polish remover, put firm pressure on the back of the spoon to transfer the photo onto the wood\u2019s surface. Move back and forth across the back of the photo so it lays down evenly. Alternatively, use a brayer to roll the photo smooth. Peel the paper off of the piece of wood slowly. Pinch the corner of the paper between your fingers and peel it back from the wood. The photo should have completely transferred onto its surface. If the paper starts to rip, try pulling it from a different corner instead. Printing on Wax Paper Glue a piece of wax paper to a sheet of printer paper. Use a glue stick to attach the wax paper to a regular sheet of printer paper. Make sure the glossy side of the wax paper is facing up. This will make it easier for the wax paper to go through the printer without ripping or jamming. Don\u2019t leave any lumps of glue between the paper since this could jam the printer. Print the picture onto the wax paper. Feed the paper into the printer so the photo prints on the glossy side of the wax paper. Make sure the photo prints out to the same size as your piece of wood. You can use either a laser or inkjet printer on the wax paper. Mark a regular piece of paper in your printer and make a test print. Look for the mark on the test print to determine which way the paper feeds through your printer. Press the printed photo onto a flat piece of wood. While the ink is still wet, lay the piece of paper on top of the wood. Use the side of your fist to press on the photo firmly. Rub it so the ink transfers onto the wood. Work quickly after the photo is printed since the ink will only sit on the surface of the wax paper for about 5 minutes before it dries. Lift the paper gently off of the wood. Peel the paper off of the wood slowly so the picture doesn\u2019t smear. The picture will look faint and the wood grain will be visible. Let the wood dry for 30 minutes before handling it.",
