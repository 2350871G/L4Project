Whether you are enjoying your coffee hot or cold, you can add milk or a milk alternative to your cold brew coffee. Add 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of whole milk, half and half, creamer, or a dairy-free creamer to make your drink particularly creamy.

Heated cold brew coffee might pack less of a punch from your usual hot coffee, but it will make for a smooth, flavorful, and delicious warm drink! Select a cold brew coffee with a strong concentration to avoid making coffee that is too watery. Heating cold brew coffee without that undesirable \u201cburnt\u201d flavor requires that you dilute the original concentrate. Whether you are making your own cold brew coffee or purchasing a pre-made batch from a store, you will need to select a batch with a strong concentration to avoid over-diluting, resulting in a cup of coffee that is too watery. Boil six ounces of water for every eight-ounce cup of hot cold brew coffee you wish to make. Once the water is boiling, pour it into a large mug and mix in two ounces of strong concentrate cold brew coffee for every six ounces of water."
