Create rows of the cookie dough balls on baking sheets, leaving about two inches of space between them. If you\u2019d rather have thicker, chewier cookies, leave the dough as is. If you\u2019d prefer thinner, crunchier cookies, flatten out the balls slightly with your fingers or by pressing down on them with a fork coated in sugar. This recipe makes about 24 cookies, although you may make a bit more or less, depending on how big you make the dough balls."
