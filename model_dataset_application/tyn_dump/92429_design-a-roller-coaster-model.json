Lift Hill Depending on the type of roller coaster, the difficulty of applying the lift hill may vary. A wooden roller coaster will be harder to apply, as the chain of the lift must squeeze in between the supports underneath the track. Begin placing 3-4 wires next to each other in the center of the track on the lift hill.  Select 2 places at the top and bottom of the track, where the lift will go through to meet under the track.

Launch sections The launch sections are usually simple to place on models, since majority of roller coasters with them are flat. The following will explain the most common forms of launches. LSM\nLinear Synchronous Motor is basically the simplest to apply, and can be found on the recently opened roller coaster Maverick, at Cedar Point. Apply 2 or 3 wires onto the launching section of the model, up to the hill, inversion, turn etc. As easily as that, you're done! LIM\nLinear Induction Motors are fairly easy to apply, and are often featured inside of the coaster's station. Most launched roller coasters are LIM roller coasters. These types of roller coasters use magnetic mechanisms to launch forward. Small pieces of plastic can easily do the job. Begin to gently squirt glue onto the inner portion of the designated track. begin placing each piece on the track individually, and hold each into place for a short amount of time. Hydraulic Hydraulic launched roller coaster models require more attention, because the launch section requires dozens of brakes. Kingda Ka, Top Thrill Dragster, and Storm Runner are all hydraulic launched. Small metal plates are a great choice, but if you aren't able to get a hold of them, chips of plastic will do. begin applying glue and the plates/plastic onto the track. Make sure the brakes are the closest to being perfectly aligned. NOTE: Hydraulic launched roller coasters must have a rectangular track.
