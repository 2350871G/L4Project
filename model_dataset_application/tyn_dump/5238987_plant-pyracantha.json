A few disease-resistant options include Apache, Fiery Cascade, Mohave, Navaho, Pueblo, Rutgers, Shawnee, and Teton. Apache grows 5 feet (1.5 m) high and 6 feet (1.8 m) wide. It produces bright red berries. Fiery Cascade grows 8 feet (2.4 m) high and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. It produces orange berries that gradually turn red. Mohave can reach heights and widths of 12 feet (3.7 m) and produces orange-red berries. Teton survives well in cold climates and can grow as tall as 12 feet (3.7 m) and as wide as 4 feet (1.2 m). The berries are golden yellow. Gnome is resistant to cold weather and produces orange berries, but it tends to be more susceptible to disease. It grows 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and 8 feet (2.4 m) wide. Lowboy grows 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) tall but spreads out much further. It produces orange berries and is very weak against disease."

Nutrient-dense soils can cause the shrub to become very bushy. As a result, it becomes weaker against diseases like fire blight and may yield less fruit. Note that the ideal soil pH for pyracantha is between 5.5 and 7.5. In other words, it does well in neutral to slightly acidic soils."

Pyracantha has dangerous thorns. When the plant grows tall instead of wide, these thorns are kept out of reach. When planting pyracantha against a wall, choose a planting site 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) away from the wall itself. Soils directly next to the wall can be too dry. Avoid planting the shrub next to a painted wall, doorway, or gate since the thorns and prickly leaves can scrape away the paint. It is also recommended that you do not train the plant against the foundation of single-story buildings since it can grow too large and cause problems."

When removing a plant from a disposable plastic container, you can usually press on the sides of the container to ease the plant out.

Most pyracantha cultivars are strong enough to hold themselves against a wall or fence without any assistance, but they will still benefit from being tied down. Run wires along your wall next to the pyracantha and tie the branches of the shrub to these wires with string or cable ties.

Nitrogen causes the plant to grow too many leaves. As a result, fruit yield suffers and the plant can be more susceptible to disease. If you do choose to fertilize the plant, use a balanced fertilizer containing equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium or one containing more phosphorus and potassium than nitrogen.

Wait until the plant finishes flowering in mid spring to remove new growth. Prune the new growth at your own discretion, leaving at least a few flowers so that fruit will develop in the fall. Note that fruit will only develop on growth that is at least one year in age. Prune the leaves of the plant when the fruits develop in early to mid fall. Remove just enough growth to expose the fruit to air and prevent it from rotting. Remove leaves and branches selectively in the late fall to early winter to accentuate the best of the brightly colored berries.
