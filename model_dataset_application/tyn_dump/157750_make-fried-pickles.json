Remove the pickles from the oil with a set of tongs. Place them on plates covered in paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve. Serve the fried pickles immediately with a small bowl of ranch dressing for dipping. Spicy Fried Pickles Make the sauce. To make the sauce, just mix 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tbsp. drained horseradish, 2 tsp. ketchup, and 1/4 tsp. Cajun seasoning together in a medium-sized bowl. Stir the ingredients until you've created a rich and creamy mixture. Heat the oil. Heat 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable oil until the oil and place the pickles in the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Make the batter.

This should take 1-2 minutes. Remove them from the heat. Remove the pickles from the pan with the same slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to drain them. Repeat the process with the rest of the pickles and batter.  Serve. Once the pickles are ready, serve them with the sauce you've made. You can also serve them with a few celery sticks. Sweet and Spicy Fried Pickles Pour vegetable oil into a large skillet and heat it to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). The oil in the fryer should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Make the cornmeal mixture. Combine 1 cup self-rising cornmeal mix, 1/4 cup flour, 1 tbsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. ground cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Make the milk mixture. Combine 1 lightly-beaten egg and 1/2 cup milk together in another bowl. Stir them together until the egg is blended with the milk. Cover the pickles in both mixtures. Dip 2 cups well-drained bread and butter pickle slices in the milk mixture and then roll them in the cornmeal mixture. Fry the pickles in batches for 3 minutes each. Place a batch of pickles on the frying pan and fry them for about 3 minutes each, until they're golden brown. Remove the pickles from the heat and drain them on paper towels.  Serve. Serve these tasty fried pickles as soon as they're ready. You can add a ranch dip on the side or serve them with 2 tbsp. of hot sauce. Beer-Battered Fried Pickles Drain two 16 oz. of dill pickle sandwich slices. To do this, simply pat the pickles dry with a paper towel. Make the egg mixture. Whisk together 1 large egg, one 12 oz. can of beer, 1 tbsp. of baking powder, and 1 tsp. of salt. Add 1/4 cups flour into the mixture. Whisk the ingredients together until the mixture is smooth.

Let the excess batter drip off the pickles. Fry the pickles until they're golden brown. This should take about 3-4 minutes. Serve. Serve the pickles with spicy ranch dressing. Dry Batter Breading Fried Pickles Remove the pickles from the jar. Choose as many as you wish to fry. Use tongs to pluck them out. Make a breading mixture from flour and cornmeal. Add spices to taste. Pour all of the mixture into a quart or gallon bag.  Toss the wet pickles into the bag. Gently shake the bag. The process will evenly coat the pickles.
