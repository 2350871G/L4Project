When you heat your sweet potato in the microwave, it warms up quickly and steam gathers in-between the fleshy inside and the skin. If you don't poke holes in the skin for the steam to escape, your potato will explode in the microwave. You only need to open small holes in the skin, so don't stab your potato deeply with your fork. Alternatively, you can cut a shallow \"X\" onto the top of the potato, using a knife. Trust me, you do not want to skip this step!"

          "headline":"Wrap your sweet potato for cooking.",
          "description":"Take a full-sized paper towel and dampen it with cold water. Gently squeeze out the excess water and take care not to rip the towel. Lay the towel flat on a microwavable plate and place your sweet potato in the center of the paper towel. Cover the potato by loosely folding the sides of the paper towel over it. The wet paper towel will provide a steaming effect when microwaving your sweet potato. This will also help to keep the potato moist and prevent it from shrinking, and it will also result in softer skin. Never use aluminum foil for microwave cooking! Do not wrap your sweet potato in metal foil while cooking in the microwave. This will cause sparking and is a potential fire hazard. Doing this will also break your microwave."

          "headline":"Put the plate in the microwave and select a cooking time.",
          "description":"Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the potato and the power of the microwave. Most medium to large potatoes will take between 8-12 minutes to cook at full power. Try putting the potato in for 5 minutes to begin with, then take it out and turn it over so that both sides cook evenly. Place it back in the microwave for another 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft it is already. After that, if it still doesn't feel fully cooked, continue to microwave it in 1 minute bursts, checking after each minute. If you are cooking multiple potatoes at once, you will need to increase the cooking time by about two-thirds. For example, if one large potato takes 10 minutes to cook, two large potatoes would take between 16-17 minutes. If you prefer crispy skinned sweet potatoes, you can cook the potatoes in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, then unwrap your sweep potato and transfer it to a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for 20 minutes. This method is great if you want oven-crisp potato skins, in less than half the normal cooking time!"
