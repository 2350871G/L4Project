Leave all of the ingredients out at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes prior to preparing the mayonnaise. This aids in the process of emulsification, or binding of the ingredients."

      "description":"Once the ingredients have reached room temperature, place 2 small egg yolks or 1 large egg yolk, along with 1 tsp. (5 g) of salt and 1 tsp. (5 g) of white pepper, into a medium size mixing bowl and mix gently using a wire whisk."

      "description":"Fill a measuring cup with 8 oz. (2.5 dl) of olive, corn, peanut or safflower oil. Holding the measuring cup of oil in 1 hand and a wire whisk in the other hand, let a small amount of the oil drip into the mixing bowl while stirring briskly with the wire whisk. Once the mixture has begun to thicken and increase in volume, increase the rate of oil from a drip to a very slow pour. Continue to vigorously stir in the remaining oil."
