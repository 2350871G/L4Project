  "text":" Creating a Casting Mold Get a 2-piece mold frame. To successfully cast metal, you\u2019ll first need to acquire a mold frame (also known as a mold flask) made of wood, iron, or a similarly solid material. Make sure the frame comes in 2 parts and is large enough to hold the object you want to cast. Look for mold frames online or from specialty metal supply stores. As long as it is sturdy, the specific material used to make your mold frame does not matter. Place the object you want to cast in 1 of the mold frame pieces. Place 1 of your mold frame pieces on a flat working surface. Then, put your casting object in the center of the frame, making sure its flattest side sits face down on the table. If you\u2019re casting an object that comes in 2 pieces, place the bulkiest piece in the frame right now.

Then, pour additional, unsifted sand into the mold, making sure to fill it well above the frame\u2019s top border. Tamp the sand down and scrape off any excess. Tamp the molding sand down by pressing the paddle end of a rammer into the material and twisting it left and right. Once you\u2019ve thoroughly tamped the material, scrape the excess sand away using a straight edge. When finished, the top of your mold should be completely smooth. For the best results, tamp the areas around the edges of the frame tightly and the areas directly over your casting object loosely. Flip your mold over and place the other frame half on top. Once you\u2019ve tamped the sand down, cover your mold frame with a solid board and carefully flip it over. Then, place the other half of your mold frame on top of the current mold. If you\u2019re casting an object that comes in 2 parts, place the second piece of your item in the top frame and line it up with the first piece. Repeat the process with the other side of the mold. To create the second half of your mold, cover the exposed side of your object with parting dust and fill the cast with molding sand. Then, tamp the sand down until you create a fine, smooth surface. When you\u2019re finished, carefully pull the 2 mold frame pieces apart. Adding a Sprue Hole and Riser Holes Create a sprue hole using a dowel rod. Grab a dowel rod and push it into the molding sand next to your casting object. Rub the dowel rod into the sand until you create an approximately  0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide hole that runs from 1 end of the mold to the other. You\u2019ll use this hole to pour liquid metal into the cast. You only need to make a sprue hole in 1 of the mold frame pieces. Cut a gate between the cast object and sprue hole.

Then, carefully pull it out of the mold. Your sand is incredibly delicate at this point, so be cautious when handling the casting object. If necessary, use your finger to clean up any rough edges on the mold. If your sand appears extremely wet, give the mold some time to dry out. Otherwise, you can cast with it immediately. Filling Your Mold Put on leather gloves, boots, and protective eyewear. Safety is essential when working with hot metal, so make sure you put on a pair of leather working gloves, thick leather boots, and either protective goggles or a full face-shield. While you\u2019re working, use extreme caution to prevent any unfortunate injuries. Lock your mold frames in place. If you haven\u2019t already, press the 2 sides of your mold frame back together, making sure the central casts line up with each other. Then, toggle your frame\u2019s locking mechanism to hold everything in place. If you\u2019re creating an aluminum cast, you can take your mold out of its frame if you so desire.
