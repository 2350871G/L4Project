Set up your work station near a sink if possible so you can re-wet the sandpaper whenever you need to. If you have a deep scratch on your plexiglass, then start with 600-grit sandpaper instead.Tip: Run your fingernail over the scratch perpendicularly. If your nail falls into the scratch and catches, then it's considered a deep scratch. If your fingernail goes over the scratch, then it's light."

          "description":"Apply light pressure to the scratches with your wet piece of sandpaper. Work in small, circular movements to buff the surface evenly. Sand any areas that are scratched for 1 minute, and wet the sandpaper again when it feels dry. Your piece of plexiglass may start to look cloudy or frosted over, but it will not stay that way when you finish."

          "headline":"Alternate between a dry and wet piece of sandpaper for the next 2 minutes.",
          "description":"Switch to a dry piece of 800-grit sandpaper and go over the same areas. Keep working in small circles so the scratch is buffed completely. After about 30 seconds, switch back to using wet sandpaper. Change the sandpaper you're using every 30 seconds for the next 2 minutes. Alternating between wet and dry sandpaper creates more abrasion and helps work through the scratches faster."

Start with a wet piece of sandpaper for 30 seconds and then switch to a dry piece. Keep alternating between wet and dry sandpaper for 3 minutes to buff the plexiglass."

Apply a coin-sized amount of plexiglass polish onto a clean cloth and work it into the glass in small circular motions. Keep buffing the polish for 30 seconds or until it turns clear on your surface. Wipe the polish off with a clean, dry cloth to remove the scratches. You can buy plexiglass polish from your local hardware store. Plexiglass polish may also be called acrylic polish in stores."
