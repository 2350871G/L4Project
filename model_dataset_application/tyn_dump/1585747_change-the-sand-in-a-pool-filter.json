This will stop water from entering the system while you clean it, as well as cutting power to the area while dealing with water. The switch for your pool filter should be nearby the filter itself.

This will let all of the water drain out of the tank, so make sure it is draining somewhere away from your pool that will not be affected by a lot of water. Fully draining the tank can take up to an hour, so give it plenty of time. If your pool filter is in a pump house or anywhere else you don\u2019t want water draining, quickly attach a hose over the drain plug after you remove it. This will let the water drain elsewhere. Make sure not to lose the drain plug, or any other components you remove from the pool filter. Keep them somewhere safe until they are ready to be reattached."

Adding New Sand Reattach the drain plug to the base of the tank. Before adding any new sand to the tank, you\u2019ll need to reattach the drain plug. Screw it back in place at the base of the tank, making sure to tighten it in order to prevent leaks. Pour new pool silica sand into the tank.

Use a garden hose to add water to the tank until it just begins to cover the sand. This will give the tank enough water to clean the sand and get the pump functional before you start filtering your pool water. Lubricate the O-ring on the valve with a multipurpose lubricant. Locate the rubber \u201cO-ring\u201d around the top of the multiport valve where it will form a seal with the mouth of the tank.

Reattach the multiport valve. Remove the tape or plug from the top of the standpipe and position the multiport valve over it. Carefully connect the opening in the valve to the top of the pipe, and firmly push the valve into the top of the tank. Wiggle it around slightly as you push it into place to make sure it is secure. Screw the collar and pipes back in place. Position the collar around the edge of the multiport valve and use the two bolts to tighten it into place. As you do so, alternate between bolts to ensure the pressure is equally distributed around the collar. Reattach the pipes and screw the unions on as tightly as you can to prevent leaks. Backwashing Your Filter Make sure your backwash hose is connected to the backwash valve. Backwashing will flush dirty water out of the system, so it is important it has somewhere to go. Attach a backwash hose to the backwash valve if needed, and make sure the other end feeds out somewhere away from your pool. Turn the filter to backwash. Push down on the lever on top of your multiport valve and rotate it until it is in the backwash position. This will allow the filter to clean out any excess dust or impurities in the new sand before it starts filtering into your pool. Turn the pump on for 2 minutes. Once the filter is set to backwash, turn the pump on to begin backwashing your filter. Leave it running for at least 2 minutes to fully clean out the filter. Check the sight glass in the side of the valve, or the water coming out of the hose to make sure it is clearing up. Rinse the filter for 1 minute. Turn the handle on the top of the multiport valve to the \u201crinse\u201d position, and let the pump run for another minute. This will clean the water further, so use the sight glass or hose to make sure the water inside the tank is clear. Always make sure you have turned the pump off before switching positions on your multiport valve. Turn the valve back to filter and turn on the pump. Once the water is running clear, your sand has been replaced successfully and the filter is ready. Turn the handle on the valve back to the \u201cfilter position\u201d and turn your pump back on.",
