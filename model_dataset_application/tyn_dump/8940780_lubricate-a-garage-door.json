Spray down the outside of the springs and near the center of the bearing plates, then open and close your garage door to spread the grease around. You will most likely need a step ladder to reach the springs and bearing plates. If your springs are making noises, you need to grease your springs.

The top portion of the rail is what your chain actually rides along, so it's the part that needs to be lubricated. Spray down the top of the rail and then spread the grease around with a rag. The chain comes with a natural protectant on it that makes it so that you don't have to grease it regularly. Spraying the bottom of the rail doesn't do anything.
