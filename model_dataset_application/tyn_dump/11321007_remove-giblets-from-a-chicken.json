You can do this by soaking your chicken in cold water for a couple of hours, or letting it sit in your fridge for a few days if you have time. Your chicken doesn\u2019t need to get up to room temperature, but it should not be frozen before you start preparing it. Cold water thawing takes about 30 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of chicken, while fridge thawing takes about 5 hours per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of chicken."

Use scissors or a knife to cut the packaging off if you are having trouble. From this point on, you\u2019ll be touching raw meat with your bare hands, so be aware of any surfaces that you touch or tools that you handle so you can wash them later.
