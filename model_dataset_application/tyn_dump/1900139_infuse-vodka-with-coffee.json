  "text":" Make Simple Syrup Boil the water in a medium saucepan.  Lower the heat to medium and stir in the sugar, stirring with a wooden spoon until the sugar has dissolved.  Add the vanilla extract and boil for another 3 to 5 minutes. This will help the syrup to thicken. Set the saucepan aside and allow the syrup to cool. It should have a golden brown color, like the color of Grade A maple syrup. Pour the syrup into a 1/2-Liter jar that has been sterilized.  Store the syrup in the refrigerator as needed.  Prepare the Vodka Place the funnel into the top of the 1-Liter bottle and pour in the coffee grounds. Make sure that you have sterilized the bottle either by dipping it in boiling water or by running it through a dishwasher. Pour the vodka into the jar using the funnel so it covers the coffee grounds.  Secure the lid on the bottle and then gently swirl the jar to mix the coffee grounds.  Open the lid, replace the funnel, and pour in the simple syrup until the bottle is full. You will probably use 1/3 to 1/2 of the syrup that you made. Reserve the rest for continued use as you infuse the vodka. Tighten the lid and shake the jar until a light foam forms. The froth will be tan or white. Allow the foam to settle and then top off the jar again with a touch more of the simple syrup.  Infuse the Vodka Place the jar of coffee, vodka and syrup in a cool, dark place. Allow the jar to sit for at least 5 days. Check the vodka daily to see if air has formed in the top of the jar. If it has, then top off the jar with more simple syrup. After 5 days, taste the infusion. If the taste is strong enough, then you are ready to filter the vodka. If not, then infuse it for another couple of days. Filter the Vodka Pour the coffee vodka into a French press. Try to get as many of the coffee grounds into the press as possible. Clean the bottle that you used to infuse your vodka, making sure that all the grounds are washed away.  Place the funnel into the top of the bottle, and place a cone filter into the funnel.  Depress the French press about 1/4 of the way down. Pour the liquid into the cone filter and wait for it to filter into the clean bottle. Repeat the process until your coffee grounds look dry inside the press.  Clean the French press and pour the vodka back into the press so you can filter it a second time. Be sure to clean all the sediment out of the jar before the second filtering, and replace the first filter with a clean second filter. Taste the finished product, adding simple syrup as needed. Store the vodka in the refrigerator.",
