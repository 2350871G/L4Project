When the weather is dry, collect your nuts less often\u2014every 1 to 2 months. Wet weather is more likely to cause mold, germination, and rat or pig damage. Always make it a top priority to get your nuts inside during this weather. Healthy macadamia trees begin bearing nuts after 6 to 7 years.

The first two can be caused by prolonged drought and poor drainage, while the third is typically caused by stresses such as low pH and nutritional problems.

Apply mulch after harvesting your nuts, and avoid piling it against the tree's trunk\u2014this can cause disease.
