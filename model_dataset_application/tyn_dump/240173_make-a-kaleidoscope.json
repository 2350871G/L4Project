If you'd like, make the circle a little bit bigger. You can then cut tiny slits along the edges so the circle lies flat on the end.

To make these lines easier to fold later, you may wish to measure and trace these lines in marker first, then use a paper cutter or box cutter to lightly score these lines into the plastic.

Tape the strip along the edge using transparent tape, so the triangle hold its shape. Slide the triangle into the cardboard and create your peephole. Cut a paper towel roll down to 8 inches, the same size as your triangle. Slide the plastic triangle into the paper towel roll. To create your peephole, turn the paper towel tube on one end, standing straight up. Trace a circle around it on black construction or contact paper.

    "Making an Advanced Version with Acrylic Mirror and PVC Pipe Prepare the mirrors.",
    "Cut a piece of acrylic mirror into three 7 \u20448 inch (20.0 cm) by 1 \u20448 inch (2.9 cm) rectangles, using an operating table saw with a carbide-tip blade.",
    "Use a vacuum to clean any sawdust from the mirrors.",
    "Prepare the PVC pipe.",
    "Cut a white PVC pipe with a diameter of 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) to a length of 7 \u20448 inches (20.0 cm) using a chop saw with a carbide tip-wood blade.",
    "Clean the tube to remove any dirt or debris.",
    "Prepare the end cap.",
    "Drill a \u20448 inch (1.0 cm) hole into the center of a 1 \u20442 inch (3.8 cm) PVC socket end cap.",
    "Wipe around the hole to remove any debris.",
    "Prepare the foam strips.",
    "Cut a strip of adhesive-backed foam into pieces about one inch long.",
    "You will need three pieces for the kaleidoscope.",
    "Prepare the foam rope.",
    "Get a piece of foam rope that's half an inch in diameter.",
    "Cut it into one inch pieces.",
    "You will need three of these for the kaleidoscope.",
    "Glue a petri dish to one end of the PVC tube.",
    "The petri dish should be 60 mm by 15 mm and should be made out of plastic.",
    "Use PVC cement to attach the petri dish to the tube, being careful not to get any cement on the dish.",
    "You can either leave the glass clear to create a \"world view\" kaleidoscope or you can create a colored kaleidoscope by drawing on the inside face of the petri dish using colored permanent markers before you attach it to the PVC tube.",
    "Assemble the mirrors.",
    "Gather the three mirrors, long sides together and gently fold them into a triangle with the shiny sides facing in.",
    "Make sure you have removed any protective film first.",
    "Neatly tape the mirrors together using transparent tape, so that the edges of the three mirrors form an equilateral triangle.",
    "Attach the foam strips to the mirrors.",
    "Remove the adhesive backing from the three pieces of foam and stick one piece on the side of each mirror, approximately one inch from the end.",
    "Place the mirrors inside the PVC tube.",
    "Gently insert the mirrors, foam end first, into the PVC tube.",
    "You may need to squeeze the foam to make it fit.",
    "Insert the three pieces of foam rope into the spaces between the mirrors and the tube.",
    "Close it up.",
    "Place the PVC end cap over the open end of the PVC tube, twist to secure tightly.",
    "Your kaleidoscope is now ready, enjoy the view!"
