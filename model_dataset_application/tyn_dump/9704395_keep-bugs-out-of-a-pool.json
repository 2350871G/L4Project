During the warmer months, when your pool is uncovered, make sure to turn on the pump for at least a few hours every day. The circulation will keep mosquitoes from landing or laying eggs in the water.

You can choose from a variety of chlorine forms to use in your pool, such as tablets, granules, or liquid chlorine.Use a testing kit daily to check your pool\u2019s chlorine levels and decide how much you\u2019ll need to replenish them.
