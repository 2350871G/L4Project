It\u2019s best to use distilled water when steaming anything, but especially when working with vinyl upholstery. Though you can use a steamer made for car upholstery, a regular handheld steamer will work just fine. Steamers are super useful tools. Not only can you use them on clothes (say good-bye to ironing! ), but you can also use them to remove wrinkles from items that are hard to wash, like curtains."
