  "text":" Brushing Try brushing before adding anything else. If this works, then you're set; if not, move onto another method. Use an old toothbrush or a clean household brush. Do this regularly. Keep an eye on canvas furniture, awnings and sails around the house. As soon as you spot bird droppings, remove them. The faster this is done, the easier the stain will be to remove. Household soap Brush off the droppings to remove anything that will come off easily. Use a household small dustpan brush to do this. Rub the stain using mild, plain household soap. Dampen the bar of soap and rub it over the stain to cover. Leave the soap that has been rubbed on for half an hour. Rinse off well with clean water.  Repeat the rub and rinse process until the bird droppings are removed.  Pressure wash and laundry liquid soap Brush off the droppings to remove anything that will come off easily.

Salt and lemon juice Brush off the droppings to remove anything that will come off easily. Use a household small dustpan brush to do this. Hose or pressure wash the stain with clean water. (See the previous method for tips about pressure washing with care.) Make a paste of salt and lemon juice. One lemon should be sufficient for a standard stain but you'll need to judge by how large the extent of the bird droppings. Add enough salt to the juice to form a paste.
