That said, while any meter can test the wattage of a plug-in appliance, keep factors like the following in mind:\nAccuracy. Some models claim an accuracy range of less than 0.5%, while others have ranges of 3% or more. (with a 3% range, an actual wattage of 600 might read anywhere from 582-618 W). Depending on your needs, high accuracy may or may not be of great importance. Design. Look for a functional design setup with easy-to-understand buttons and digital readouts. Some models come in 2 parts connected by a cord so that you can place the digital readout in a convenient spot\u2014such as on your desktop instead of at the outlet under your desk."

    "If the item you\u2019re testing isn\u2019t already drawing power, turn it on now.",
    "If you\u2019re testing a car, you have 2 options, both of which you can test with the clamp meter.",
    "You can turn the key halfway in order to draw power from the battery without starting the engine, or turn the key the whole way to start the engine.",
    "The amperage readings you get may vary in these 2 situations.",
    "Write down the amp measurement on the clamp meter\u2019s display.",
    "It may take around 5 seconds for the reading to appear.",
    "Once you\u2019ve jotted down the reading, remove the clamp meter and set it aside.",
    "If you\u2019re testing your car, for example, you might get an amp reading of 5 A while the vehicle is running.",
    "Multiply the volt (V) and amp (A) measurements to get watts (W).",
    "Remember that power (measured in watts) is the product of voltage (volts) and current (amperes).",
    "This means that some quick multiplication gives you a wattage reading for the device you\u2019re testing.",
    "For example, if your car tests gave you readings of 12 V and 5 A, your wattage test result would be 60 W (12 x 5 = 60)."
