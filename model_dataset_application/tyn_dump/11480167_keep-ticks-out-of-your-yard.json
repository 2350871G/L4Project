          "description":"When grass grows out, it provides cover for ticks. Optimally, keep it about 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) high. Trim it back down to that height by the time it reaches 3 \u20443 in (9.3 cm) in height. In doing this, your grass will stay healthy and dry so ticks have nowhere to hide. Keep your lawn trimmed by mowing it every 1 to 2 weeks. To keep your lawn healthy, cut it by no more than \u2153 of its length. Cutting it too short can kill the grass."

          "headline":"Prune shrubs and bushes to remove old branches.",
          "description":"Put on a pair of gardening gloves, pick up a pair of shears, and cut your plants back into shape. Snip off dead and diseased branches at the plant\u2019s trunk. Then, thin out your overgrown plants by removing the oldest and weakest branches. Finally, keep the remaining branches trimmed back to the appropriate height for your yard. Pruning is great for keeping your plants healthy and shapely. Trim them at least once a year to prevent them from overgrowing. By keeping shrubs and bushes trimmed, you enable more light and air circulation to reach the soil underneath them. It keeps the soil dry while also eliminating shade ticks may use to hide."

          "headline":"Clear leaves and other debris from your yard.",
          "description":"Take time to rake up leaves as they fall in your yard. Put them in waste bags for pickup by a local waste disposal company. Also, collect sticks and other wood debris to bundle for disposal. Focus extra attention on keeping the edges of your yard neat, but don\u2019t neglect the other areas. Debris provides plenty of shelter for tiny ticks or even small animals carrying them. Clear it out right away so it doesn\u2019t have a chance to pile up in your yard. Don\u2019t forget to eliminate hidden debris. Leaves could end up under bushes, around walls, or in other areas where they aren\u2019t quite as easy to see."

          "headline":"Remove ground cover plants that could house ticks.",
          "description":"Ground cover means low-growing plants used to stop weeds from growing. Although they are useful and can even look good in your yard, they are also a hiding spot for ticks. To stop ticks from spreading, cut out the high grass and plants around the perimeter of your yard. Try to limit them in areas you frequently visit as well. You don\u2019t have to get rid of all of the plants in your yard. If you keep some, especially short ground cover plants, grow them in small patches away from the edges of your yard. Some types of ground cover plants include alfalfa, clover, ivy, and pachysandra. Some of these plants, such as pachysandra, are deer-resistant or have other uses. If you wish to take advantage of them, grow them sparingly."

If you have to keep it outside, move it toward the edge of your property to make it harder for ticks to travel across your lawn. Be aware of any brush growing near wood piles.

          "description":"If your yard is close to a forest, ticks may cross over from there. To keep ticks away, remove weeds and other plants from the border area. Dig a trench about 3 in (7.6 cm) deep, then fill it with a material like gravel. Ticks have a hard time walking across an open, sunny area like a gravel border. Gravel and other types of stone are the best choice for this project. They don\u2019t decay like organic mulches do and they retain a lot of heat, which ticks don\u2019t like. If you choose an organic mulch, such as wood, plan on replacing it once it shows signs of decay. It often starts decaying after about 5 years."

To prevent the ticks from spoiling your fun, position all yard fixtures, including furniture, away from wooded areas. If they are out in the open, ticks will have a harder time reaching them. Play activities for children often run the risk of tick problems, especially when they are positioned near woods. Install slides and swing sets in a central part of your yard that receives a lot of sunlight. If you have to keep something near a wooded or grassy area, lay a gravel ground border that ticks will have a hard time crossing."

Remove the grass under playgrounds, for instance, and excavate to install a layer of cedar about 3 in (7.6 cm) deep. Scatter cedar around the edges of your patio or other areas to prevent ticks from crossing them. Cedar and other organic wood mulches are also good for protecting gardens. They don\u2019t retain as much heat as gravel, making them safer for plants. Remember to trim back any plants growing around the mulch.

Plant them near the borders of your yard, around walls, and in gardens to keep the ticks at bay. Pennyroyal, garlic, sage, mint, and chrysanthemums are a few options that are also effective on ticks. Note that some plants you may choose can be toxic to animals. If you have pets, make sure they won\u2019t be able to reach your tick repellants"

The best time to spray is after snow melts, usually around May in most areas. Put on a respirator mask, eye goggles, gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, and long pants for protection. After loading the pesticide into a sprayer, mist the perimeter of your yard and other areas that may have ticks. Some areas to consider treating include spots that retain a lot of moisture, areas overgrown with plants, and structures with cracks and other openings.

It will keep out deer, but also other animals, including stray dogs, cats, and racoons. Make it about 8 ft (2.4 m) high so deer can\u2019t jump it.

You could also purchase predator urine, such as coyote or bobcat urine, to keep in your yard. If that doesn\u2019t sound appealing, make your own repellent by mixing aromatic ingredients together. Try mixing ingredients like hot sauce, eggs, and garlic into water. There are some smelly plants that serve as deer repellents. Thyme, sage, lavender, and others work on both ticks and deer. If repellents aren\u2019t enough, you could try growing plants that don\u2019t attract deer. Fuzzy or prickly plants like lamb\u2019s ear are good options as well as thick ones like pachysandra. Some plants, like poppies, are toxic, so deer won\u2019t bother with them."

Make sure they are away from play areas, wood piles, and other spots ticks can hide in. If possible, keep them away from grass. One way to protect feeders and baths is to surround them with mulch. Mulch, especially stone, doesn\u2019t leave much shelter for ticks. Keep feeders and baths clean. Pick up spilled seed around feeders so tick-carrying mice don\u2019t come looking for a free meal.

Repair bigger gaps by filling them in with patching concrete or another material. If mice are willing to live in a particular spot in your yard, ticks most likely are too.
