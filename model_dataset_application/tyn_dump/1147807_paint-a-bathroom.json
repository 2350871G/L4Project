Since they're more durable and easier to clean than matte options, glossier finishes are ideal. The only downside is they highlight imperfections, so it's important to prep surfaces before you paint. As for color, look for a shade that complements the hallway or room next to the bathroom. Lighter shades are usually good choices for smaller spaces. Paint manufacturer websites often allow you to upload a photo of your room to play with wall colors. It's also wise to purchase samples and test shades in the actual space. Keep in mind glossier finishes reflect more light, which makes colors appear brighter."

Soak a sponge or mildly abrasive pad in the solution, wring it out, and scrub all surfaces you plan on painting. It might seem like a lot of work, but you wouldn\u2019t want your new paint to start peeling in only a matter of months. Alternatively, dilute concentrated TSP (trisodium phosphate) cleaner with water as directed. TSP is a stronger cleaner, so you won't have to scrub as hard. Wear rubber gloves when using TSP or a bleach solution. If your bathroom has a window, open it; if not, turn on the exhaust fan."

It also absorbs paint, which makes it less likely that you\u2019ll step in a spill and accidentally make tracks around your house.Word of caution: Since canvas is absorbent, you\u2019ll need to clean up any big spills before the paint seeps through the canvas.

          "description":"If you\u2019re painting the ceiling, use a brush to cut in around the edges where it meets the walls. Finish the job by using a roller on the end of an extension pole. For best results, use a quality, plush roller cover, which will allow you to get as much paint onto the ceiling in the shortest amount of time. Dip the roller into the paint tray's well, then roll up the tray to remove excess. Start in a corner, and roll in a continuous stroke. Try to keep the roller wet, and overlap the painted edges and your previous strokes by about 3 in (7.6 cm). If you\u2019re using a latex paint, you should be able to apply a second coat after 4 hours. For even coverage, apply the first coat in one direction, or north to south, and the second in the other direction, or east to west. Cutting in is basically coloring within the lines; it's when you hug a tight edge with the brush.Tip: Choose mildew-resistant ceiling paint, which is flat (not glossy), dries slowly, and spatters less. While mildew-resistant products are a bit pricier, but they hold up better to moisture and last longer."

Depending on the type of paint you\u2019re using, apply a second coat after 4 to 24 hours. Semi-gloss is a good finish for bathroom trim. Baseboards, chair rails, and window and door trim collect dust and grime, and semi-gloss is more durable and easier to clean than flat finishes. White is conventional for trim, but you could experiment with color, especially if your walls are white. Grays, blues, and black are trendy choices if you want your trim to make a statement."

Additionally, tape around your bath fixtures and wall tile. Even if you have a steady hand, you should still tape horizontal trim, such as baseboards, chair rails, and horizontal runs of tile.

However, if your bathroom is currently dark and your new color is light, it\u2019s wise to prime. Use the same techniques for primer as you would for the top coats: cut the edges with a brush first, then use a roller to paint broader areas. You should also spot-prime any areas you patched. Drywall compound is porous and will absorb paint, resulting in noticeable dull spots. Priming your repairs will help keep them inconspicuous."

Then turn back and bring the tip of the brush to the trim, taking care not to paint beyond the edge of the wall. To prevent unsightly lines, paint along the edges of 1 wall, then finish the rest of the wall with a roller before moving on to the next one. Complete 1 wall at a time so you're always painting over wet paint. Painting over dried or tacky paint leads to noticeable lap lines. If you paint the trim all around the room, it\u2019ll dry by the time you pass the roller over the rest of the wall. Go with a satin or semigloss finish for bathroom wall paint.
