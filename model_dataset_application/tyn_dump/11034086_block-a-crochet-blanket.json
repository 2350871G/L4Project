You can do this by washing the item on the delicate cycle in your washing machine or by soaking the item in a small tub of cool water. You may use a small amount of detergent to wash or soak the blanket if desired, but plain water also works fine for blocking."

Then, place the blanket on a towel and roll the towel up around the blanket to blot more water out of the blanket. Use more than 1 towel to blot the excess water out of the blanket if needed. Do not twist or stretch the blanket as you wring out the excess water!"

Arrange the blanket how you want it to look when it is dry, but be careful not to stretch it out. Aim for straight edges and an overall even appearance. There are also special blocking mats that help to promote air circulation under the blanket as it dries. These are available at craft supply stores or online."

Push each of the pins all the way through the blanket and towel, and then back up again. Use rust-proof pins to prevent stains on your blanket.

If you have a small blanket, then it might only take 12 hours to dry, whereas a large blanket will take longer. If you are in a hot, dry climate, then your item will also dry faster than if you are in a cold or humid climate. Wait until the blanket is completely dry to remove the pins.
