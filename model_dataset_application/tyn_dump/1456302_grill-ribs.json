They range in length from 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 6 inches (15.2 cm) and are meatier than spare ribs. Spare ribs are from the section of the rib cage under the back ribs. Spare-rib meat often is tenderer than back ribs because of its high fat content."

Charcoal grill: After ash forms, move the briquettes to one side of the grill. Place 2 or 3 wood chunks on the coals. Put a small baking pan with about 1 inch (2.54 cm) of water in it on the cool side of the grill. The steam from the water helps keep the rib meat moist and tender."
