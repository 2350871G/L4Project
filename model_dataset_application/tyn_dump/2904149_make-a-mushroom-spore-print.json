      "description":"The mushroom must be mature to ensure that it has enough spores to print. A freshly picked mushroom is more likely to have live spores than a store-bought one. If parts of the mushroom cover the spores, the printing effect won't work as well. Avoid using mushrooms that are shriveled, bruised or appear old. Flat mushrooms create the best prints."

To protect the dusty print, spray with spray fixative, such as hairspray. Several coats should be adequate. Be careful though, as the pressure from the spray can easily disturb the spore print and change its shape."
