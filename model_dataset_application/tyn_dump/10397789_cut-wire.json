Use these if you are cutting 8- to 24- gauge wire. Since they have a narrow tip, long-nose pliers also work great to bend loops into wires and attach multiple wires together. If you are cutting wire for a jewelry project or trimming guitar strings, this may be a good option."

Diagonal cutting pliers have a sharp, rounded tip, making them great for stripping and cutting wire. You can use these for nearly any type of wire. Diagonal cutting pliers are also widely used for removing pins and nails as well. If you want to cut a wire hanger, for example, this is a good option."

These work great for projects where you don\u2019t have much wire left over or if you need to splice 2 wires close together. You can also use end-cutting pliers to cut nails and rivets."

Even a sharp pair of scissors may not cut through wire without damaging the internal metal. It is also easy to slip and cut yourself when cutting wire with a pair of scissors, since the blade may not grip the wire as well as a set of pliers."

If your pliers or wire cutters are dirty before you use them, this can cause you to slip up as you make the cut. If your tools are not in proper working condition, do not use them.

As you do this, avoid rocking your tool from side to side or bending the wire. If you cut the wire too forcefully, the tail of the wire may fly up into the air. If the wire does not cut entirely with 1 snip, open the handle of your tool and make another cut at a right angle."
