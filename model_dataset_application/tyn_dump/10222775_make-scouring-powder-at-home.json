          "description":"Baking soda can be used as a scouring powder on its own, or you can add extra ingredients to make your powder more powerful. Either way, you'll want baking soda to be the base of your scouring powder. This will be enough scouring powder for about 1-2 uses."

It helps lift off stubborn soap scum or residue, making it great to use in homemade scouring powders. For everyday cleaning, borax is not always necessary. However, it may take some of the elbow grease out of your cleaning task. Borax also works great to remove strong odors."

The granules add some scrubbing power to your powder, so you can easily remove tough stains. If you are worried about scratching your surfaces, you do not need to use salt."

These oils are known to help clean and disinfect. While essential oils are optional for your scouring powder, they make your bathroom or kitchen smell amazing. You can also use essential oils including lavender and eucalyptus."

Chop off about 1/4 from the end of your soap bar, and use a kitchen grater to create soap shavings. Then, add your shavings for a touch of bubbles. Keep in mind that this is optional.

However, a shaker jar works great to easily distribute your scouring powder across your surface. Place a funnel at the top of your jar to ensure you don\u2019t spill any, and fill up your container to the top. If you are making a large batch, you can use multiple containers to store your scouring powder."
