Ideally, use a stud finder that can tell the difference between studs, pipes, and other obstacles. Failing that, locate studs with magnets, or knock on the wall listening for hollow sounds. You can also refer to the blueprints of the space if you have them. If there is any uncertainty, drill a small test hole and explore with a bent wire coat hanger.

Find a feature visible from both sides, such as a vent. Measure from there to the location you chose, then measure the same distance on the other floor.

Keep the hole at least 1\u00bc\" from the edge of the wood. If this does not allow for a hole large enough to insert your wires, separate the wires and insert them through separate, smaller holes, spaced a reasonable distance apart."
