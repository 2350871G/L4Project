Oil-based paints also dry slower than latex or water-based paints, giving you more time to paint. Choose whatever color you like: some homeowners prefer white baseboards, while others like baseboards that match the walls.

Apply masking tape to all of the baseboards you\u2019ll paint before you start any painting. Masking the baseboards protects the walls from paint, so you can avoid getting paint on the walls while you are painting the baseboards.

Place the sheet of plastic against the bottom of the baseboard. Tape the plastic down with regular masking tape, right where the baseboard meets the floor. Purchase large sheets of thin plastic at a hardware store or home-improvement store. If you\u2019d rather not buy enough plastic to cover the entire room, you can use 1 large piece and remove it, then re-tape it, for each new section of baseboard that you paint."
