          "description":"Fresh cabbage can be identified by its crisp leaves. The leaves should be tightly packed for round varieties and only slightly loose for long varieties. Additionally, there should be no signs of browning and the stem should look fresh rather than dry. Green cabbage is a round variety. Its leaves should be tightly packed together and dark green on the outside. The inner leaves will be a pale green. Red cabbage is another round variety, and its leaves should also be tightly packed together. The outer leaves are especially tough, and all of the leaves should have a reddish purple color. Savoy cabbage is a round variety, but its leaves are crinkled and fairly loose when compared to green and red cabbages. The leaves can range in color from dark green to light green. Napa cabbage is tall and skinny, with loose, pale green leaves."

  "text":" Before You Begin: Preparations Choose a fresh head of cabbage. Fresh cabbage can be identified by its crisp leaves. The leaves should be tightly packed for round varieties and only slightly loose for long varieties. Additionally, there should be no signs of browning and the stem should look fresh rather than dry. Green cabbage is a round variety. Its leaves should be tightly packed together and dark green on the outside. The inner leaves will be a pale green. Red cabbage is another round variety, and its leaves should also be tightly packed together. The outer leaves are especially tough, and all of the leaves should have a reddish purple color. Savoy cabbage is a round variety, but its leaves are crinkled and fairly loose when compared to green and red cabbages. The leaves can range in color from dark green to light green. Napa cabbage is tall and skinny, with loose, pale green leaves. Use a stainless steel knife. Use a sharp, stainless steel cooking knife with a smooth, sturdy blade. Only use stainless steel knives. Do not use knives made from other metals, because the natural chemicals within the cabbage can react with other metals. As a result, both the cabbage and knife can turn black. Keep the cutting board stable. Spread a moist paper towel in between the cutting board and the counter to prevent the cutting board from sliding around. Soak the paper towel in water and squeeze out the excess moisture. This gives the towel just enough tension to prevent it and the cutting board from sliding around. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/18\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/18\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDo not let the towel stay soaked, though, since a soaked paper towel will be too slippery. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2a\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2a\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nNote that this may not be necessary if you are using a no-slip silicone cutting mat. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f8\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f8\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Clean your working area and supplies.

Round cabbages have tightly packed leaves and are spherical in shape. Common varieties include green cabbage, red cabbage, and savoy cabbage. Remove the outer leaves.

Long cabbages have somewhat loose leaves and are somewhat rod-shaped. The most common variety is the napa cabbage. Remove the outer leaves. Use your hands to peel away damaged leaves on the head of cabbage. Tall heads of cabbage with loose leaves lack the thicker outer leaves that round heads have. As such, you only need to remove leaves that are wilted, discolored, or otherwise damaged. Cut the head in half lengthwise. Place the head of cabbage on its side and cut in half lengthwise, from the top of the head through the core. You do not need to remove any part of the core when cutting a long cabbage. In fact, for wedges, it is actually beneficial to keep the core. The core holds the leaves together, which means that the wedges will be able to remain intact, as well. Cut each half in half again. Flip each half over so that the cut-side faces the cutting board. Cut in half lengthwise once more, creating quarters. Since these cabbages are tall and skinny, you probably will not be able to cut wedges that are any skinnier than this without causing the leaves to fall off the core. Cut crosswise, if desired. You can stop after cutting the cabbage into quarters, but if these pieces are too long for you, cut each quarter in half crosswise to reduce the length of each wedge to half. Note, however, that any wedge not attached to the core is more likely to fall apart. Even if the wedge gets destroyed, though, the cabbage will still be edible. Rinse the cabbage. Gently rinse each wedge under cool, running water. Drain dry on layers of clean paper towels. Even though the inside of a cabbage is usually clean, you should still rinse it under running water just to be safe. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3b\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3b\\/Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cut-a-Cabbage-Into-Wedges-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nHold the cabbage wedges over a colander in case any of the leaves break off under the pressure of the running water.
