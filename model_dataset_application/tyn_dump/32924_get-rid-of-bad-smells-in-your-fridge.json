    "If you can live without your fridge for a few days, try this method.",
    "Spread dry, fresh coffee grounds across 2\u20133 baking sheets.",
    "Place each sheet on a different level of your refrigerator.",
    "The smells should leave within 3\u20134 days.",
    "During this time, you\u2019ll need to keep your food in a second refrigerator or in a few ice-filled coolers.",
    "Once the 3\u20134 days have passed, dispose of the coffee grounds, wash the baking sheets, and put your food back into the fridge.",
    "Set 2\u20133 baking sheets of unscented cat litter on different shelves.",
    "Coffee grounds can leave behind a slight coffee aroma in your fridge.",
    "If you\u2019d like to absorb foul smells without leaving your fridge smelling like coffee, opt for cat litter instead.",
    "Spread a layer of clean litter in 2\u20133 shallow baking sheets and place the sheets on different shelves in your fridge.",
    "Leave the fridge running and empty with only the litter inside for 2\u20133 days to absorb any lingering smells.",
    "Purchase unscented cat litter at any pet store or large supermarket.",
    "Some home-improvement stores will also stock cat litter.",
    "Let activated charcoal absorb bad odors if other methods fail.",
    "Fill 3\u20134 small cloth bags with about 1 cup (130 g) of loose activated charcoal.",
    "Then place the charcoal-filled bags on different shelves in your fridge.",
    "Set the refrigerator temperature to low and leave the door closed as much as possible for several days.",
    "The smells in question should go away within 3\u20134 days.",
    "Activated charcoal can be purchased from pet stores or drugstores.",
    "Unlike with the coffee grounds method, you can use activated charcoal while your food is still in the fridge.",
    "Preventing Bad Smells Toss expired food weekly to prevent bad smells from accumulating.",
    "To prevent odors in the future, make a point to look in your fridge once a week or so and remove expired food.",
    "This preventative measure will keep foul smells from building up in the first place.",
    "It\u2019s much easier to prevent bad odors in your fridge than it is to eliminate them.",
    "Try looking right before you take out the trash.",
    "That way, you\u2019ll be able to get the spoiled, smelly food out of your home as soon as you\u2019ve noticed it.",
    "Store fresh foods where they\u2019re visible so they don\u2019t spoil unnoticed.",
    "Fresh items like fruits and vegetables can easily go bad without your noticing if they\u2019re tucked away in a seldom-opened veggie drawer or the back of a bottom shelf.",
    "Prevent this by storing them in a location where you\u2019ll be able to see them daily.",
    "Then, if you notice any fresh foods starting to look a little past their prime, dispose of them immediately.",
    "For example, keep meat at the front of the top shelf, and keep fruits and veggies on a lower shelf where they\u2019re easily visible.",
    "Set the temperature in your fridge between 35\u201338 \u00b0F (2\u20133 \u00b0C).",
    "When kept in this temperature range, food will keep without going bad.",
    "Since it\u2019s only when food spoils that it begins to smell, you\u2019ll keep your fridge smelling fresh and clean as long as the temperature remains in this range.",
    "If the temperature in your fridge rises above 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C), bacteria will begin to grow and the food will begin to smell.",
    "Were you to set the fridge temperature to 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) or lower, of course, the food would freeze.",
    "Keep leftover food in airtight containers to prevent it from smelling.",
    "If you leave food uncovered in your fridge or leave it in, for example, a cardboard takeout box, it\u2019ll go bad quickly.",
    "The sooner food goes bad, the sooner it\u2019ll begin to stink up your fridge.",
    "By keeping leftovers in a sealed airtight container, you\u2019ll help them last longer and prevent foul smells.",
    "As an extra measure to keep food from spoiling in your fridge, label and date leftovers when you store them.",
    "Tear off a piece of masking tape and stick it on top of the airtight container and write, for example, \u201cFebruary 14; chicken parmesan.\u201d"
