If that doesn\u2019t do the job, you can move on to hydrogen peroxide, which will work with moderate levels of grime. If your grout lines are really grimy, you may need to use oxygen bleach. However, chlorine bleach should generally be avoided. Chlorine bleach will discolor your colored grout, so you should leave it in the cupboard. Instead, choose either hydrogen peroxide or oxygen bleach. If your colored grout is dirty around dishwashers or sinks from hard-water deposits, you can use a vinegar solution. In a spray bottle, pour an equal amount of vinegar and water. Spray a bit of the solution on the grout lines. Then, scrub the grout lines with your grout brush. If you don't have a grout brush, a toothbrush will also work. If vinegar alone isn't working, a good alternative is a baking soda and vinegar mix. Wet baking soda with just enough water to make a thick paste. Apply the paste to your grout, then spray it with vinegar. Let the solution sit until it stops bubbling, then scrub the area with a brush. Rinse with clean water and dry with a rag."
