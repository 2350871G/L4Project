Nestle the broken pottery piece into the sand so that the cracked section is facing up. This enables you to use both hands to make the repairs. If you don't have sand, you can also use rice to the same effect. You could also use a large pot, a shallow serving dish, or something similar to hold the sand as long as it's deep enough to fully support the pottery."

        },
        {
          "headline":"Mix a 2-part epoxy adhesive to fill cracks and reattach broken pieces.",
          "description":"Squeeze the epoxy onto a non-porous disposable surface, like a thin sheet of plastic, and use a wooden or plastic stick to mix together the 2 components as quickly as possible. It'll start to harden after 3 to 4 minutes, so you need to work fast. Some 2-part epoxies come in a container with a syringe that will distribute both parts equally for you. If yours doesn't come with that, disperse each part of the epoxy in lines so that you can gauge by eye that the 2 components are equal. Avoid using superglue for repairs. Superglue is very thin, and while it's strong, it won't protect your pottery from future breakages along the same cracks as well as epoxy will.Warning: If your piece of pottery is used with food, like a mug or a soup bowl, look for a food-safe adhesive or one that is silicone based. There are both epoxies and other types of adhesives that are FDA-approved for food safety."

Don't worry about using too much or if it is going over the edges\u2014you'll be able to remove that excess epoxy later on. If you're working with a crack rather than a break, use a toothpick to apply the epoxy to the crack. Push the epoxy into the crack as far as you can, then squeeze the piece together so the crack adheres back together.Tip: Hold small pieces of broken pottery with tweezers while you apply the epoxy to keep your fingers clean."

Get it in line as perfectly as you can and hold it in place for about 30 seconds or as long as the epoxy directions instruct. If you're worried about getting the adhesive onto your hands, wear a pair of rubber gloves while you work. If there is more than one piece to reattach, do one at a time rather than trying to do them all at once. If the pieces aren't staying together well because of the position of the pottery, use a small piece of modeling clay to pinch the edges together. It'll come right off once the piece has fully dried."

Most fast-acting epoxies take about 20 minutes to fully set, but always follow the instructions for whatever brand you're using."

This will just finish the process so that there are absolutely no bumps or imperfections on your piece. To double-check the surface run your thumb over the sealed cracks. The sensitivity in your finger should allow you to easily feel if there are more sections that need to be sanded."

Mix your colors carefully to get as close a match to the original color as possible. You can also spray an acrylic gloss over the repaired area if the rest of the piece is shiny and you want the crack lines to be less noticeable."
