Keep peeling the skin until it is all gone. If there are any stringy bits, pull those off too. Pry the orange open before you eat it. Stick your fingers into the hole at the top of the orange, and pry it open like a book. Separate the wedges, and eat them individually. Be sure to pick out any seeds, or to spit them out."

Stick handle into one side of seam, pointing it towards the top of the orange. Run handle all around orange, prying the peel away from the flesh. Repeat for other side of the seam. When you are done, pull the peel away from the orange, like a hat or sock. Try rolling the orange around on table before you peel it. This will loosen the orange from the skin and make it easier to peel."

The slit should go from one cut end to the other. Finally, use your fingers to pry open the orange, like a book, into a long strip. Use your fingers to pull the orange segments off of the peel, and eat them. Don't cut too much; about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) off of each end will be enough. This method works best for Mandarin oranges, but many people find that this works with regular oranges as well, such as Valencia."
