Also prepare your sewing machine by threading it with a thread that matches the color and strength of the material you are going to sew. This is also a good time to plug in your iron, so that it's already heated up when you need it."

          "description":"Putting the wrong sides together is the opposite of what is normally done when sewing a basic seam, so don't worry if it feels counterintuitive. A French seam requires you to stitch each seam twice, folding over your first line of stitches in order to make your finished seam face the right direction. Be sure to pin all the way down the seam you are sewing. This will help to make sure your fabric doesn't slip out of line. It's a good idea to put pins in so they are perpendicular to your seam line, this way they won't stick you as you move the fabric along in the sewing machine and they will be easy to grab as you move your fabric in the sewing machine."

          "headline":"Sew the fabric together using a 1/4 inch seam allowance, removing pins as you go.",
          "description":"To keep your seam allowance the same width as you sew your seam, keep an eye on the seam allowance guide that should be printed on the thread plate of your machine. Another option is to use a 1/4 inch presser foot, that way you can just make sure the outer edge of your fabric always lines up with the edge of the presser foot. The seam allowance is the amount of fabric that is between the edge of the fabric and the seam. Patterns usually give a specific amount of seam allowance to use, so that your finished project doesn't turn out too bit or too small. Remember that the french seam will basically require about double the allowance you use on this first seam, so make sure when you are cutting out your pieces of fabric that you have figured that into your measurements. Feel free to increase the seam allowance on this first seam to 3/8 inch, if you are more comfortable sewing that width, but keep in mind that you will need to increase your overall seam allowance to accommodate this. It's best to remove pins right before you are about to sew over them. This will keep the fabric in place but will avoid the risk of hitting one with your sewing machine needle, which could easily break the needle. Remember to clip any threads and remove any remaining pins after sewing."

Remember, this seam is not going to show by the time you are finished. Don't worry if the cut edge is a bit frayed or messy. While it would be great if you could just sew a 1/8 inch seam, and therefore not waste any fabric, most sewing machines need more than 1/8 inch of fabric for the machine's feed dogs, the pieces of rough metal under the presser foot, to grab onto and pull along."

Iron the piece with the seam you just sewed going straight down the outer edge of the fabric. You'll want to iron very carefully and neatly so that the seam on the outer edge is perfectly straight. Make sure your iron is set to the correct temperature for the fabric you are using.
