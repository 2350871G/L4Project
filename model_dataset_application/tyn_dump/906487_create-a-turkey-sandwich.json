If you don\u2019t have a toaster, preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C), place your bread on a baking sheet, and pop it in for 3-5 minutes, or until it just begins to brown. Be careful not to get your bread too done, as this could make it overly crunchy or result in an unpleasant burnt flavor."
