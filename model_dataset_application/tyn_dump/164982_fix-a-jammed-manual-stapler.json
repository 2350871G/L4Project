See if you can get it out without even having to open the stapler. Stick something round, like a pen or pencil, between the base of the stapler and the metal part that holds the staples. Then, push down as if you were stapling some papers together. This may expel that jammed staple for you. You could also just hold the metal enclosure away from the base with your hands; just be careful to keep your fingers away from the staples! If the staple doesn\u2019t come out after doing this, it\u2019s time to move on and try to manually remove the jammed staple."

Remove all the excess staples from the tray and set them to the side. If your stapler loads from the back, pull out the staple tray and set it to the side. This is also a great time to check that you\u2019re using the right size of staples.

But if it is really stuck in the tray, you may benefit from having a little more access to both sides. Most manual staplers should allow you to pull the stapler tray up and away from the base. This is a good time to clean off the interior of the stapler, too, to keep it free from grime and excessive dust. Use a can of compressed air to blow away dust, or wipe down the entire stapler with a soft, lint-free towel. Avoid using water, as that could cause the stapler to rust."

Push the prongs of the jammed staple upward to try and loosen it from the grip of the stapler. If needed, grasp the staple from the top and pull it up, too. Don\u2019t use your fingers to try and push the staple up as you\u2019ll most likely hurt yourself.
