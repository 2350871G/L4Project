          "description":"To ensure that the oven is hot enough when it's time to bake the brownies, set it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Next, line a 9-inch by 9-inch (23-cm by 23-cm) baking dish with parchment paper or foil, and then grease it with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Make sure you know how your oven indicates that it's fully preheated. In most cases, a light will flash or a beep will sound to alert you."

That should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes, but don't try to rush the process by turning up the heat. Remove the pan from the heat once the butter has melted. It helps to stir the butter with a wooden spoon while it's on the stovetop to make it melt more quickly. If you're in a hurry, you can melt the butter in the microwave. Cut the butter into pieces, place it in a microwave-safe dish, and microwave on high for 30 to 45 seconds or until it's fully melted."

Whisk the mixture continuously to ensure that the eggs are fully combined. It's a good idea to crack the eggs into a separate dish before adding them to the other ingredients in case one or both are rotten. You don't want to ruin the entire batter by adding a bad egg."
