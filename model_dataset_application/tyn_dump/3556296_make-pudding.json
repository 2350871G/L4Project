          "description":"Pudding is still consumed in many varieties across the Commonwealth, but people in the United States have simplified the term to mean a cold, custard-like dessert. This recipe is streamlined to be as simple as possible without sacrificing deliciousness, but there are dozens of alternate methods out there if you decide to explore variations in texture or flavor. This recipe can be made with or without melted chocolate. If you decide to skip the chocolate you may wish to up the vanilla extract to 2 tsp (10 mL) for a stronger flavor. This pudding will take at least an hour to chill and thicken. Allowing at least four hours is recommended if you plan on serving it as dessert, as individual variation can cause some puddings to take longer."

If you are using cornstarch, mix in \u00bc cup (30 g) of this as well. Use a whisk if you have one, since it will be useful in the next step.

If using egg yolk, remove the milk from heat once thickened, then add it in a very thin stream to the egg mixture, whisking constantly.
