Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the counters and remove any crumbs or dirt that may have been left from daily use. You can lightly sand your counters every month before you re-oil them if there are marks or stains you want to remove. However, it\u2019s not necessary to sand your counters before applying the oil."

If you've refinished your countertops before, just use 180- to 220-grit sandpaper to remove marks and stains from the wood. Sanding the entire surface will ensure the whole countertop has the same coverage and colour."

Then, rinse the cloth or sponge and wipe down the counter with clean water to remove the soap. Whatever soap you use to clean your dishes will work for this step."

Alternatively, you can wipe down the counters with diluted bleach rather than vinegar. Dilute the bleach by mixing 1 part bleach with 80 parts water.
