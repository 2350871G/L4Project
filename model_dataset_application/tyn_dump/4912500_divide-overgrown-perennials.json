          "description":"Unlike annual blooms, perennials produce new shoots every year and continue to grow larger. After 3-5 years, your perennials will start to crowd their planting area and make it difficult for them to receive nutrients. Keep track of how long you've had your plants so you know when they're ready to transplant. Note when you add a new plant to your garden or landscaping so you can remember when you need to divide them. Watch your plants to see if they have weak growths, fewer flowers, or a thin/bare spot in the center of the clump, since these may be signs that you need to divide your plants."

If you have perennials that fully bloom late in the summer or early in fall, choose a day in early spring to make your divisions so the roots can establish themselves and make your plant stronger. Check that there are no risks of frost or ice before you start planting or else smaller divisions may not survive. Some examples of fall blooms include mums, goldenrod, daylilies, aster, and sedum. Look online for when the last expected freeze occurs in your area so you know when to start dividing your plants.Tip: The perennials may not have strong blooms the year that you divide them, but they will usually get stronger the following year."

Plan on starting your divisions in the later summer or early fall months so the roots have enough time to grow and recover before the next bloom. Make sure you plant at least 6 weeks before the first frost in your area or else weaker divisions may not survive. Spring blooms include plants like peonies, daisies, irises, and hostas.

If you need to separate larger perennial plants, you may need to pry them apart with gardening forks or even use an ax to chop it.

Don't overwater your plants so there's standing water around them since it could cause them to get waterlogged and unhealthy. Splitting the Root Ball Push a shovel into the ground 6 inches (15 cm) away from your plant. Measure at least 6 inches (15 cm) out from the main growth on your plant. Drive the blade of your shovel vertically into the ground, and pull the handle back toward you to rock the dirt up and down. Once you loosen the dirt in the first spot, pull your shovel out of the ground. Be careful of other plants in the area so you don't accidentally cut their roots or affect their growth. If you're dividing spreading perennials, such as gooseneck and bee balm, or woody perennials, like lavender and rosemary, you only have to dig up the section you want to divide. For other perennials, it's easier to remove the entire plant from the ground. Work your shovel around the plant in a circle to lift it out of the ground. Move the blade of your shovel to either side of where you just placed it and push it into the ground again. Continue working the shovel back and forth around the plant until you make a full circle. When you go once around the perennial, the dirt should be loose enough for you to lift it up and out of the ground with your shovel. If you can't lift up the plant after going around it with your shovel once, try loosening the dirt a second time. Separate the stems so each section has 3-5 shoots.

Try to spread the roots as much as you can without damaging them so they can get the most nutrients from the soil. Cut off any weak or broken roots immediately so they don't develop rot or make your plant die. Transplanting Your Divisions Dig a new hole that's 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) wider than the root ball. Find a place to put your plant with a similar amount of sun throughout the day as the old location. Check that the area is well-drained so your plant doesn't get overwatered. Make sure the hole is the same depth as the root ball and is 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) wider on each side so it has space to grow. You can also transplant divisions into a flower pot if you want to have a houseplant.Tip: If you don't plan on replanting your divisions right away, keep the roots submerged in water in a shady place until you're ready to replant them. Amend the soil with compost or fertilizer where you're planting the divisions. Put a \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) layer of compost at the bottom of the hole you just dug so your new plant can get nutrients while it starts growing again.
