Lay them out flat in the shape of the box with the corners touching. You can do this either over the prepared site for the box, or off to the side if you have the space. Keep in mind that the frame will be quite heavy after you assemble it. If you are making a garden box of a different size, just adjust the lengths of the lumber for the sides accordingly. 12 in (30 cm) is the ideal height for raised garden beds so that the plants have plenty of room for their root systems. Use a natural wood that will endure the elements well, like cedar, if you want your garden box to last a long time. If cedar is too expensive, then you can use cheaper pressure-treated lumber that will withstand the elements for many years.

This will be much easier if you have someone helping you to hold the sides in place while you screw them together.
