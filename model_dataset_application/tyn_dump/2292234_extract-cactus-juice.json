  "text":" Removing the Spines Wear a thick pair of gloves. Leather or rubber gloves usually work best since these materials are the hardest for cactus needles to pierce. Carefully apply a long strip of tape to the outside of the cactus. Place a strip of duct tape so that it runs in a straight line from the top of the cactus to the bottom without overlapping. Rip the tape off. Use a quick motion, but do not pull so hard or so fast that you cause the cactus to topple over. The tape should have removed many of the needles. Repeat the taping process. Continue ripping out the needles using tape until enough needles have been removed for you to grab the cactus safely. You should still wear your gloves, however, since some of the needles may remain. Dig out the spines with a knife or pair or pliers. The spines are the harder jagged points along the surface of the cactus where the needles grew from. Removing the spines decreases the risk of running across a stray needle, and it also makes it easier to juice the cactus since the hard spines contain no juice. Steady the cactus with one hand. Dig the knife or pliers into the cactus under each spine bud. Gradually push up on the bud from underneath until it comes out. Remove the pads from the pears. Each portion can be juiced, but both parts must be juiced differently. The pads are the flat \"vegetable\" or leaf part of the cactus while the pears are the rounded \"fruit\" of the plant. Cut the pads and pears away from the cactus using a sharp knife. Juicing the Pads Wash the pads beneath running water. Lightly scrub the pads with a potato brush under lukewarm water. Scrubbing the pads removes any sand or dirt from the exterior of the pad, but scrubbing too hard may pierce the pad and cause some of the juice to leak out prematurely. Place the pad on a flat counter. Cut away any bruised parts of the pad using a small, sharp knife. Transfer the pads to a large bowl. The bowl should be large enough to fit the pads, and it must also have a large enough mouth for you to work with the pads inside the bowl. Crush the pads. Use the flat top of a hammer-style meat tenderizer or other flat kitchen utensil. Press the tenderizer against the pads, crushing the juice out. Continue pressing until the pads are thoroughly broken and removed of most of their juice. Strain the juice out. The pad pieces should be relatively large, so the juice should not be too pulpy. Simply pour the juice through a wire mesh strainer and into a separate glass or bowl, allowing the solid portions to remain trapped on the other side of the strainer. Discard the solids once you are finished. Juicing the Pears Wash the pears under running water. Use lukewarm or cool water and scrub them clean with a vegetable brush. Cut off the ends of the fruit. Cut off approximately 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters) from both ends of the fruit, essentially removing just enough to cut away the skin and expose the inner flesh. Slit the fruit. Use a sharp, heavy knife. The slit should only cut halfway into the fruit instead of the entire way through, and it should extend from the top end of the fruit straight through to the bottom end. Place the slit fruit into a deep pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the fruit by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Bring the water to boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer the cactus pears. The fruit needs to simmer until the interior becomes soft and mushy. This may take between 45 and 60 minutes. Check the softness of the interior by inserting a fork through the slit. If it is still hard, continue to simmer it in 10 minute intervals until it softens. Remove the fruit from the water. Allow it to cool to room temperature before attempting to handle it. Cut the fruit open. Cut into the slit, slicing the fruit through to the other side. Scoop out the inside of the fruit. It should be soft enough to remove with a spoon by this point. Place the pulp, seeds and all, into the center of a large square of cheesecloth. Bring the ends of the cheesecloth together. Knot or twist the ends into a tight bundle to prevent any pulp from escaping through the top. Hold the cheesecloth over a large bowl. Squeeze the juice out of the cheesecloth. Squeeze the bundle of cactus pulp through the cheesecloth, pushing in a downward motion to direct the juice out through the bottom of the cloth and into the bowl below. Continue squeezing until juice no longer drips from the bottom of the cloth.",
