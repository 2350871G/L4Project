The bowl that you use should be large enough to contain the full 10 cups (850 grams) without overflowing, and ideally should be made of plastic, glass, or porcelain. You can use any type of regular coffee grounds that you\u2019ve produced through making coffee. Just save them up for a few days until you\u2019ve produced the 2 cups (170 g). You can get sawdust from any nearby hardware store. Since 8 cups (680 g) is a relatively small amount, they may give you the sawdust for free. You can also use hay that has been pasteurized in boiling water for 35 to 45 minutes. Just mix the hay and mushroom spawn together in a plastic bag that has holes poked in it."

Start by adding about 2 cups (0.47 L) of water, and add more water as necessary. If you accidentally add too much water and the mixture becomes soupy, just pour some water back out.

The water should be boiling hot after microwaving, so if it\u2019s not that hot after 2 minutes, microwave for another 2 minutes. If you skip this step and do not microwave the sawdust and coffee ground, bacteria may kill the mushroom spawn before they have a chance to grow.

Periodically test the temperature of the spongy coffee grounds and sawdust by pressing your finger into the mixture. If you\u2019re in a hurry, try putting the bowl in your fridge for 30 minutes."
