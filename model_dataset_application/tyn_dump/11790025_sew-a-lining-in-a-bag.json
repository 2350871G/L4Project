To line a small clutch or purse, you might use a rayon or polyester blend fabric, since these are soft and shiny.

To make a small liner, just pin the corners. If you're using a patterned fabric, stack the pieces so the right sides are facing in and sew the wrong side of the fabric."

Keep in mind that the stitches may not be as sturdy as the ones made by a machine, so it's better to use a machine if the lining will get a lot of use. If you used pins along the sides, remove them as you stitch so you don't sew over them."

Although you can use drop-in liners on many bags, they're especially great for rigid bags made of fabric that doesn't bend easily.

Sewing a Turned-Out Liner into a Bag Use a turned-out liner for a flexible bag. Since turned-out liners don't need to be as exact as drop-in liners, they're great for beginner sewers.
