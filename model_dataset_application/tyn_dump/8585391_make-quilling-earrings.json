Opt for colors that look good to you and that will work for your design. Consider what you want your design to look like as well. For example, if you are making heart shapes, then opt for pinks and reds. If you are making a cone for a Christmas tree, then use green quilling."

Wrap the end of the quilling around the quilling needle and then begin to turn the needle to wrap the quilling around it. Keep turning the needle and coiling the quilling until you reach the end. To make your coils larger, use multiple strips of quilling. Just glue the ends of the strips together before coiling them. For flat quilling designs, you can coil the quilling tightly or leave it loose to create different designs."

You can leave the quilling in a circle, squeeze the sides to make it into an oval, or press on all four sides to shape it into a square. You can make a heart shaped quilling design by making two coils, loosening them slightly, and then pinching them on the ends to make a teardrop design. Then, glue the two pieces together along the flat edges to create a heart shape. You could even try using a mold to help you shape your quilling. For example, if you have a small star shaped cookie cutter, then you could place a loose spiral into the mold and push out towards the edges of the mold to form the shape into a star."

Try adding some polka dots around the edges or paint over the entire piece with a solid color. If you want to add some fine details, you can try painting them onto the quilling pieces, such as a word or initials or some small flowers.

The way that you connect your pieces depends on the types of pieces you have created. For example, if you have made a couple of different sized cones or domes, then it would probably be better to string them together using a needle and some nylon thread. For flat pieces, it may be easier to glue them together and let them sit until they are dry. You can glue together different sized coils together inside of a large coil, or glue a few different pieces together to form a shape, such as a flower. However, you will still need to add a string to attach the quilling earring pieces to the earring hooks. If you have multiple pieces that you want to hang from the earrings, make sure to string them together in the order you want them to appear."
