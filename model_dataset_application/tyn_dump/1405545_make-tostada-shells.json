  "text":" Traditional Deep Fried Tostada Shells Fried tostadas are the most authentic, but also the most fattening. Traditionally, the tortilla is deep-fried in vegetable oil. This is considered the most authentic, and often tastiest way to prepare tostada shells, though if you are watching your calories you may wish to bake or microwave the tortilla. Pour about \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) of vegetable oil into a heavy skillet.  Heat the oil. Test the heat by dropping a small piece of tortilla into the center of the skillet. If the tortilla immediately sizzles and fries, the oil is ready. Pick up the corn tortilla with a pair of tongs and carefully place in the pan. The outer edges of the tortilla should bubble, as should the center. Always be careful of splattering oil. Fry until the outer edges are golden-brown, then turn the tortilla over. Depending on your stove this may take 8 to 10 or up to 30 seconds for each side. A fully fried tostada should be a light to medium brown color. Remove the tostada shells from the pan. Let the shells cool on a plate covered in an absorbent paper towel. To keep tostadas warm, store in oven preheated to 250 \u00b0F (120 \u00b0C).  Baked Tostada Shells Baked tostada shells are generally considered the low-calorie alternative to fried tostadas. However, many cooks consider them just as tasty. Preheat oven to 400 \u00b0F (200 \u00b0C).  Brush both sides of a corn tortilla lightly with vegetable oil. Sprinkle with salt, chili powder or cayenne for extra taste. Place tortilla on a baking sheet.  Repeat the process with additional tortillas. Usually you can fit about 4 to 6 tortillas per baking sheet. Bake tortillas for 3 to 5 minutes on the first side, or until tortillas turn crispy, with light to medium golden-brown color.  Remove the sheet from the oven, turn the tostada shells over and repeat the process.  Optional: You can make your tostada shells in a bowl shape by baking them with their sides folded in a small spring form pans, weighted down with pastry molds.  Microwave Tostada Shells You can also make crispy but oil-free and extremely low-fat tostada shells in the microwave. This method may be tedious when making more than a few tostada shells. Place 2 layers of paper towels on your microwave's cooking carousel. The paper towels soak up moisture and create a crunchy texture. Layer several tortillas onto the carousel, directly onto the paper towels. Do not allow the edges of the tortillas to overlap. Cover the tortillas with an additional layer of paper towels. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Open the microwave and remove the top layer of paper towels. Turn the tortillas over and place fresh paper towels on top. Microwave on high for 1 additional minute. Optional: You may wish to microwave tostada toppings after you have baked or fried the shells.  Finished. ",
