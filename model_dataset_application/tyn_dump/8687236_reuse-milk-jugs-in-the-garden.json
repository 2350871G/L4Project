Use an awl, metal skewer, or big needle to poke the holes. Use a milk jug with a lid that screws on instead of a pop-on cap."

          "description":"An irrigator waters a planter or soil bed gradually, so it\u2019s great to use if you\u2019re out of town for a few days and can\u2019t water your garden. Simply poke at least five small holes in the bottom of a milk jug. Then bury the bottom of the jug so soil covers all the holes. Fill the jug up with water through the jug's stem using your garden hose. Keep the cap on to prevent the water from evaporating. The water will slowly flow out of the holes and irrigate your plants\u2019 roots. Be careful not to harm your plants\u2019 root systems when you bury the jug. For larger plant beds, use one jug at least every three feet (one meter)."

          "description":"Use a marker to draw a line under the handle. The line should make a semicircle and trace half of the jug\u2019s circumference, with the handle at its center. Make two more lines from each end of the semicircle to the jug\u2019s bottom, then connect them by drawing a scoop-shaped line through the bottom. You can make the shovel shape sharper if you need a trowel or make it round if you just need a scoop. After tracing your desired shape, use box cutters or scissors to cut out the opening and create your shovel. Make sure to keep the cap on the jug to hold in whatever you\u2019ll be scooping. Using a jug with a screw-on lid will hold soil and other materials better."

Hold the jug by the handle and wrap the cord around, using the cut section to hold the cord in place. If you have an electric leaf blower, edger, lawn mower, or any other corded garden tools, you can use the jug to keep your wires from getting tangled."
