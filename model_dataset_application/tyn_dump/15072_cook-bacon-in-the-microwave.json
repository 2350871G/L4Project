  "text":" Paper towel method Prepare a microwave-safe dish, preferably glass or Pyrex. Place several layers of paper towels over the dish. The paper towels will absorb all the bacon grease, leaving a mess-free kitchen, which means no dirty dishes to wash. Lay up to six uncooked bacon strips across the paper towels. Don't overlap them, or the bacon won't cook evenly. Place a layer of paper towels over the top of the bacon strips. This will prevent splattering grease from creating a mess in your microwave. Cook the bacon. Heat the bacon in the microwave for approximately 3 minutes on the highest setting, or 30 seconds per slice. Note that the time may vary by microwave and according to the amount of bacon cooking. Drain the bacon. Remove the bacon from the plate and place on a paper towel to absorb any excess grease. Allow it to sit for about 1 minute to cool. Remove the bacon from the paper towels promptly or it will stick, leaving pieces of paper towel on the bacon. Eat the bacon. Bacon cooked this way is crispy and delicious, and it won't have as much fat as pan-fried bacon, so it's actually healthier. Enjoy the crisp bacon with your eggs or pancakes, in a toasted bacon and tomato sandwich, or as a snack. Microwave Bowl Method Place a microwave-safe bowl on a microwave-safe plate. In this method, the bacon is draped over the side of the bowl. As it cooks, grease runs down into the bowl and onto the plate below for easy cleanup. Hang slices of bacon over the rim of the bowl. Place as many slices of bacon as you want around the rim of the bowl. If you don't want the bacon sticking together, keep gaps between the pieces; otherwise, don't worry about it. Cook the bacon. Place the bacon-draped bowl into the microwave. Cook the bacon on the highest setting for about 90 seconds per slice. If you're cooking a full pound of bacon, it may take up to 15 minutes.
