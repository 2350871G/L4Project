Make sure the paper you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t already have any folds, creases or wrinkles in it, as this can compromise the completed plane\u2019s ability to fly. It\u2019s recommended that you start with a bigger piece of paper to make learning the folds easier before trying it with other paper types. It\u2019s easiest to make the folds of your airplane from the top of the paper down. For the purpose of following these instructions, a basic sheet of 8.5\u201dx11\u201d (most comparable to A4 paper outside the US) letter paper will work best."

This shape will serve as the body of the plane. Leave 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) of space between the point of the triangle and bottom of the paper. Folding the paper over on itself adds weight to the plane as it reduces its size, giving it the heft to allow it to fly farther."

Stop short of overlapping the previous fold to leave a small triangular tip exposed at the bottom of the new fold. You want this triangular piece to be about an inch (2.5cm) long. This last folded point at the top of the paper will serve as the nose of the plane."

To fold this design, simply leave about half an inch (1.25cm) of space on either side of the center crease after you fold the corners that will be secured by the small triangular flaps. The corners will have to be folded at a diagonal angle to leave the top of the paper unobstructed. Blunt-nosed planes give up a little speed but fly much further due to their streamlined construction."

Double check the wing folds and make sure they\u2019re flat, even and at the same height. Make small adjustments, as tampering with the wings too much can soften the paper and decrease loft. It\u2019s normal for the plane to curve a little, so only adjust the wing height if the plane is spiraling out of control when thrown."

Bend the back edges of the wings upward very delicately so that they\u2019ll be able to catch the air as the plane moves forward. A small bend makes a big difference, so don\u2019t be too forceful or you might warp the wings out of shape. Paper airplanes operate on the same physical principles that allow real planes to fly. A slight curve of the wings is necessary to turn air resistance into lift. Try a blunt-nosed design if your plane has a problem with taking a nosedive. Pointed noses can easily become damaged when they hit the ground."

The solution to this is the opposite of the one used to correct nosedives: simply bend the back of the wings down slightly until the plane flies straight. Try a few practice throws to make sure the problem is fixed before throwing faster. Attempting to throw too hard can also cause the nose to rise, stalling the plane. Launch the plane with a smooth, straight motion of the arm and wrist to send it on its way steadily."
