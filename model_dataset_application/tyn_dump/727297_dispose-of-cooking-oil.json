Never lift heavy pots full of hot oil or pour the hot oil into the trash. Depending on how much hot oil you have, you may need to wait a few hours for it to cool. If you have to, you can leave the oil out overnight so it comes to room temperature. If you only have a small amount of cooking oil left in your pan, let it cool and then wipe it up with a paper towel."

Check the oil before you use it and discard any oil that's cloudy, foamy, or smells bad. Never mix different types of cooking oil and dispose of the oil after 1 or 2 uses. Reusing the oil more than 2 times can reduce the oil's smoke point, so it burns easier. It can also cause the fat to release damaging free-radicals and trans-unsaturated fatty acids."
