Your old door's edges should line up with the new door if they are the same size. If they aren't the same size, use sandpaper to work down the edges of your new door so that the edges of the doors run flush. Place your door in the doorframe if it's a different size than the old one. Line up the hinges on the door with the hinges on the wall.

Use a pencil to mark a line at the top and bottom of the hinge on the new door. Make sure this line is exact, or your hinges won't line up later.

Carefully push your chisel into the scored lines you created and start to scrape out a mortise for your hinges to sit in. The mortise should be \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) deep so that your hinges don't stick out of the edge of the door. Sand or chisel the mortise until the hinge runs flush with the door. When you place the hinge in the mortise, the face of the hinge should run flush with the edge of the door. Use sandpaper or your chisel to continue working down the mortise until your hinge fits into it. Screw the new hinges into the mortise. Use the screws that fit in the hinge to attach it to the new door. You may have to use an electric screwdriver to drive the screws into the door. Attaching the New Door Hang the new door in the doorframe. Fit the teeth of the hinge on the door with the teeth of the hinge on the door frame. Have someone hold the door in place as you attach it to the door frame with screws. Screw in the hinges or reinsert your hinge pins. If your hinge has screws, use the same ones you removed to reattach the hinge to the door. If it has hinge pins, insert the pins into the interlocking teeth from the top of the hinge and tap them in with a hammer. Hammering in the hinge pins will attach the door to your door frame. Install your new door knob. Take your doorknob and place it into the doorknob hole. Secure it to both sides of the door with screws and make sure that it works properly. If you've done everything correctly, your new door should be installed!",
