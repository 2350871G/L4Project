A wide variety of options are available, including those with features such as a bench for sitting inside the stall, shapes ranging from rectangles to semi-circles, and sizes to fit any need. That said, there are also a few specific varieties, and the differences between them can impact the installation process. Single-piece prefabricated showers are complete units, usually made of fiberglass or acrylic. They tend to be more expensive than other shower stall sets, and some also claim that they can be more difficult to install. As you could probably guess, the complete unit can be a bit bulky, and for that reason difficult to carry through doorways or up stairs. On the plus side, they tend to be solidly constructed and easier to clean. Interlocking multi-piece units will usually come in a set of four to six large pieces, including the shower pan (the base area where you would stand in the shower and that connects to the drain), wall coverings (for the side(s) where the unit will be mounted along the bathroom wall), side sections (that will not be placed along the bathroom wall), and a door. Quite a few of these kits are considered easy to assemble, and they generally cost much less than single-piece units."
