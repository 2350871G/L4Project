For example, you can work the shaft portion of the golf club cover until it is 8 inches (20 cm) or 12 inches (30 cm) depending on how long you want it to be.

Knit the first stitch as usual by inserting the tip of the right hand needle into the first stitch on the end of the first double pointed needle. Then, yarn over and pull through the stitch to create a new stitch. Knit all of the odd stitches in the round in the same way. Knit 1 front and back.

This will allow you to see how much more you need to knit. Just be careful when you do this to prevent any stitches from sliding off the ends of the double pointed needles. Finishing the Cover Work a decrease round by knitting 2 together. A simple way to finish your golf club cover is to work decrease rounds until the top of the cover is closed. To decrease, insert your needle into the first 2 stitches on the left hand needle. Then, yarn over and pull the yarn through the stitches. This will leave you with 1 stitch on the right hand needle. Do this to the end of the round. By the end of the round, you will have half the number of stitches you started with. For example, if you started with 100 stitches, then you will have 50 by the end of the round. Continue to decrease until the top of the club cover is closed. Each time you work a decrease round, you will have half the number of stitches at the end of the round. This means that you will have to work several rounds until you only have 1 left. For example, If you started with 80 stitches, then you will have 40 stitches at the end of the next round, 20 stitches after that round, 10 stitches after the next, and 5 after that. If you work a round with an odd number of stitches, just knit the extra stitch as you normally would. Tie off the end of the yarn and tuck in the tail. When you only have 1 stitch left, cut the working yarn a few inches from the stitch and then pull the end of the yarn through the loop. Tug the yarn to tighten and secure the final stitch. Then, push the tail of the yarn through the top of the golf club cover to hide it.
