          "description":"Traditional top hat material is no longer manufactured, but there are several modern day alternatives you can choose from. When looking for a material to use, gravitate toward fabrics that are fairly stiff and heavy. Light, floppy material will produce a floppy hat. Craft felt is one of the most popular options you can use. It is easy to find, affordable, easy to work with, and comes in a range of colors. Polar fleece and tightly-woven wool are other possible options. Fosshape, buckram, and plastic canvas can be a little harder to find and a little more expensive, but they also tend to be a little stiffer and may produce a more pleasing result when all is said and done. If you cannot find these materials in the color you want, you can paint or dye them that color."

          "description":"You will need to cut out two round circles of equal proportions. The longest diameter of these circles should be about 15 inches (38 cm). The brim pieces will be stacked and sewn together to create a double layer. This is done so that the brim has more structure and support. If you only use one piece of material for the brim, it may lack the structure it needs to be convincing."

          "headline":"Cut the \"flue\" pieces.",
          "description":"The flue is the tall, chimney-like portion of the top hat that creates the signature look of the style. You will need to cut out two rectangular flue pieces of equal proportions. The length should be 6 1/2 inches (16.5 cm) and the width should be 24 inches (61 cm). Like the brim, the \u201cflue\u201d will also consist of a double layer of fabric for the purpose of providing adequate support. Without this double layer, the top hat is likely to sink or fold over on itself once you place it on your head. If you would like to create a more playful version of the top hat, you can also cut out separate bands in alternating colors to form the flue. Stitch the bands together lengthwise so that they form a single flue piece with a height of 6 1/2 inches (16.5 cm)."

Unlike the brim and the flue, the top piece or \u201clid\u201d does not need to have much structure, so you only need one piece of fabric for it. If you do not like the look of a single layer, however, you can double this part of the hat up, as well, by adding a second piece of equal dimensions."

This circle should be about as big around as the size of your head. This circle will eventually become the opening for your head, which is why it needs to be the same approximate size. Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your head to verify that the circle in the center of your brim piece matches. Usually, the inner circle will be about 6 inches (15.24 cm) in diameter."

Do not sew along the edge of the inner circle yet. When done, you should have a solid, round disk with a circle marked in the center. Remove the pins as you sew or after you finish."

If you have difficulty keeping the pieces from shifting or moving around at the center, you could remedy the situation by pinning around the outside of the drawn circle before cutting that circle out.
