Make sure to place them in the bag in a single, flat layer to prevent them from clumping together when they freeze. Squeeze all the air out of the bag, and seal it. If you\u2019re freezing a large number of onions, prevent them from sticking together when frozen by placing them in a single layer on a shallow baking dish. Freeze them like that for two to three hours, and when they\u2019re partially frozen, you can place them in the freezer bag without worrying about them clumping together. Be sure to use plastic bags that are thick enough to protect the onions from freezer burn and keep the onion scent contained in the bag. If your bags seem too thin, double them up."

Place the bag flat in the freezer, making sure that the onions are still in a single layer as you position them. You can keep onions in your freezer for up to 6 months. If you have multiple bags of onion that you\u2019re freezing, you can stack them on top of one another to save space in the freezer. Just make sure that the onions in each bag are in a flat, single layer."

Overfilling the blender\u2019s pitcher makes it more difficult for the appliance to puree effectively. If your blender\u2019s motor isn\u2019t very strong, you may need to push down on the onions as you\u2019re pureeing to bring them into contact with the blades. To do so, set the handle of a metal ladle through the opening in the blender\u2019s lid before placing it on the pitcher. The rounded end of the ladle should be inside the pitcher, so when you start pureeing, you can press down on the onions with the ladle.
