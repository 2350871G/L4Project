How to Choose Yarn for Crocheting Hexagons\nUse cotton yarn if you want the item to absorb moisture, such as coasters, placemats, or table runners. Opt for a wool or wool-acrylic blend yarn to make something warm, such as an afghan or scarf. Choose an acrylic or acrylic-blend yarn to make something durable and machine washable, such as a sweater, scarf, or hat."

This chain of 2 provides slack for the round and will be necessary for finishing the round. Double crochet 2 times into the center of the ring. Yarn over the hook and then insert it into the center of the magic ring. Loop the yarn over the hook again, and then pull this loop back out of the ring to anchor the stitch on the edge of the ring. Yarn over again and pull through 2, and repeat. Do 1 more double crochet stitch into the center of the ring. Repeat the sequence for a total of 12 double crochet stitches.

Expanding the Hexagon Chain 2 extending from the slipstitch. Start a new round by chaining 2. This will allow you to expand the original hexagon. Wrap the yarn around your hook, and pull through the other loop on the hook. Repeat this 1 more time for a total of 2 chains.

Yarn over your hook, insert it into the chain 2 space next to it, yarn over again and pull through 1. Yarn over and pull through 2. Then, yarn over and pull through 2 again. Chain 2 and double crochet into the chain 2 space again. Follow up the first double crochet stitch in the chain 2 space with a chain of 2. Then, double crochet into the same chain 2 space again.
