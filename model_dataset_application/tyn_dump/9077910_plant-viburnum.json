Partial shade is also acceptable, and most viburnums will still do well in it. Partial shade happens in areas that get four to six hours of direct sunlight a day. For example, partial shade can be behind your house. The area be sunny in the morning, but get covered by the house\u2019s shadow later on. Full shade areas, such as those under larger plants, get less than three hours of direct sunlight a day.

Choose smaller varieties, like the European cranberry bush, that fit in well-draining containers. Be prepared to water the plant more often. Viburnum cuttings can be planted. Place them cut-down in a container filled with half peat and half sand. Cover the container, place it in indirect sunlight, and keep the soil moist. Seeds can be grown, but are much more difficult.

Potted viburnum requires more observation. You may have to water them once or twice a day in hot weather. Check the soil to make sure you don\u2019t add too much water.
