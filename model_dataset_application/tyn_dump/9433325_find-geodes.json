Explore these natural spots for a better chance of finding a geode. Limestone is typically found in warm, shallow water areas and is usually a shade of tan or bluish gray. Volcanic ash beds are formed from the eruption of a volcano. California, Utah, Nevada, Iowa, and Arizona are all known for their geodes, but you can find geodes in most other states as well. Uruguay, Brazil, and Mexico are also known for having geodes, and Madagascar has a specific type called the celestite geode."

Recognizing Geodes Look for rocks with a bumpy texture. When you're searching, you want to look for lumpy rocks. Geodes have lots of bumps and texture to them, so steer clear of any rocks with a very smooth surface. Geodes tend to resemble cauliflower in texture. Search for rocks that are round or egg-shaped. While they may not be perfectly round, geodes tend to be round or oval-shaped. They shouldn't have any super sharp or angular edges. Check the rock's weight. Look and see if your rock may be hollow, either by picking up another rock and comparing the weights, or by gently shaking your rock to see if anything (such as crystals) rattles around. Geodes tend to be lighter than most other rocks because their center is sometimes hollow. Geodes can range in size from the size of a pea to a basketball, and possibly even larger. Be prepared to dig a little. While it's definitely possible to find geodes simply sitting on the ground, some of them may be under layers of dirt or other rocks.

This is the most popular way of opening a geode due to its ease and convenience.
