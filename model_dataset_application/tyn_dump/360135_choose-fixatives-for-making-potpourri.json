      "description":"When deciding on a fixative for your potpourri, be guided by the scent and properties of the fixative, including whether you are keeping your potpourri exposed in a container or in a sachet. Powdered fixatives work better in sachets or bags where the powder can be evenly distributed and kept confined; finely chopped fixatives are better for container-held potpourri where it blends in well and does not fall the base of the potpourri as the powdered fixative would do. However, it can be harder to find the chopped or whole version of your fixative; if so, the powdered version will still work, albeit a little more messily. Naturally, availability and price will also impact on your choice."
