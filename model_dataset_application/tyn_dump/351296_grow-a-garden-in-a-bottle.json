          "description":"If you\u2019re growing multiple plants in a bottle terrarium, it\u2019s important to select species that have similar requirements for light, moisture, and soil type. Choose your plants before you start assembling your bottle garden so that you can plan for their needs. For example, if you want to grow succulents, you might choose zebra haworthia, hens-and-chicks, and kalanchoe. For a bottle garden with a moister environment, you could go for peace lilies, Fittonia, and Syngonium."

          "description":"Look for a glass bottle or jar that\u2019s large enough to accommodate the type and number of plants you want to grow. The glass should be clear and colorless to allow in light and let you see the plants easily. You can reuse your own containers, such as jam jars or glass milk jugs, or purchase a glass bottle online or from a craft store. If you choose to reuse a bottle, wash it thoroughly before adding plants. For easier planting, choose a jar or bottle with an opening large enough to allow your hand in. Otherwise, you can use a long pair of tweezers or chopsticks to insert the plants."

Choose a bottle that you can close with a lid or stopper to prevent evaporation and eliminate the need for frequent watering.Keep in mind: While closed bottle terrariums require less frequent watering than open ones, there\u2019s more of a risk of mold or bacteria building up and infecting your plants. Ideally, your bottle should have a clear cover, such as a glass lid or stopper. However, a small cork stopper will also work if the bottle allows in enough light otherwise."

This will allow water to evaporate more quickly so that your plants don\u2019t get waterlogged. A container with straight sides and a wide opening, such as a jar, will allow for faster evaporation. If you still want a relatively humid environment but don\u2019t want a completely closed ecosystem, choose a bottle with slanted or curved sides and a narrow opening."

In general, though, it will need to be well-draining, high in organic content, and free of contaminants that might cause infections in your plants. Research the kind of potting soil that\u2019s best for the plants you plan to grow and buy an appropriate mixture at your local garden center.Tip: You can make your own growing medium for most terrarium plants by mixing 1 part peat moss with 1 part soil from your garden. To sterilize it and prevent disease, moisten the soil, cover it with aluminum foil, and heat it in your oven at 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C) for about 30 minutes. Allow it to cool before using it for planting. For example, for succulents, try purchasing a fast-draining potting soil designed for cacti. For more moisture-loving plants, such as peace lilies, opt for a general-purpose houseplant soil that holds a little moisture while still draining well."

Wrap the plants with paper before putting them in to protect the leaves as they pass through the opening.

The curved sides of the bottle will help keep the inside of your container nice and moist between waterings. If you wish, you can put a lid on the bottle to maintain an even more humid environment. Alternatively, you can mist the plants instead of watering them.
