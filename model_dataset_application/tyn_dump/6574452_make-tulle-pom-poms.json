The width of the rectangle should match your desired pom pom diameter, and the length should be 1-1/2 to 2 times as long as the width. For a small pom pom, try making a 4-inch (10-cm) by 6-inch (15-cm) rectangle. For a larger pom pom, consider making an 8-inch (20-cm) by 12-inch (30-cm) rectangle. Alternatively, you could use a hardback book instead of creating a cardstock rectangle. The width of the book should match the desired diameter for your pom pom."

Wrap the tulle completely around the width of the rectangle a total of 30 times, then cut the tulle from its spool after the final pass. For most sizes, 30 passes should create an adequately fluffy ball of tulle. Extremely small pom poms may require fewer passes, and extremely large pom poms may require more. You can use one to four colors of tulle. If using multiple colors, hold the different tulle strips together and wrap them simultaneously. Shorten the number of passes according to the number of colors. One color gets 30 passes. Two colors get 15 passes. Three colors get 10 passes. Four colors get 7 or 8 passes."

For a medium pom pom, consider using a diameter of about 12 inches (30 cm). For a large pom pom, create a circle with a diameter between 24 and 30 inches (61 and 76 cm). Cut out the center of the circle. Using a straight razor, cut a second circle out from the center of the larger circle. The diameter of this circle should be no more than one-third the diameter of the larger circle. You can discard the small circle. The only piece you need for your pom pom is the large cardboard ring.
