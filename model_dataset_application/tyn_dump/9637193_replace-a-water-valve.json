          "description":"There are 3 types of valve connections, and your project's level of difficulty depends on how the valve connects to the water supply line. A threaded valve screws directly onto the water supply line and is easy to replace. In a compression connection, the valve screws into a hexagonal nut that fits around the supply line. The most difficult type to replace is a sweat valve, which is soldered onto the supply pipe. If you see a hexagonal (6-sided) nut, you'll know you have a compression valve. A threaded valve will have 2 to 6 flat sides where it meets the supply line. These flat sides allow you to remove the valve with a pipe wrench. If you have a sweat valve, you'll be able to see where the valve body is soldered, or melted, into the water supply line. You can cut off a soldered sweat valve and replace it with a compression fitting as long as the remaining supply line is long enough to hold the new valve's compression nut and sleeve."
