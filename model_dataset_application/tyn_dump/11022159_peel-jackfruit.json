Jackfruit produces an extremely sticky latex sap, so you\u2019ll need to coat your materials in oil to keep the sap from sticking to them. Use any oil that you ordinarily use for cooking in your home, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, or even coconut oil. You may also want to lay down a sheet of plastic wrap on your workspace in order to make sure you catch all the sap that comes out of the jackfruit.Warning: Do not put oil on the handle of your knife!
