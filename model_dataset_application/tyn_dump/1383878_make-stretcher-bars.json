      "headline":"Staple the corners together.",
      "description":"Lay the stretcher bars face down on a flat surface. Bring together the corner of the top stretcher bar with the corner of one of the side stretcher bars. Use a staple gun to place 3 staples over the line where the corners come together. Bring the corner of the second side stretcher bar to meet the unattached corner of the top stretcher bar. Use a staple gun to place 3 staples over the line where the corners come together. Position the bottom stretcher bar so that the corners of both sides of the bar meet the corners of the left and right side bars of the stretcher. Use a staple gun to place 3 staples over the lines where the corners come together. Ensure that the staples on each corner are placed in a position perpendicular to the line where the stretcher bars come together. Flip the stretcher bar frame over. Use a staple gun to place 3 staples over each of the lines where the corners of the stretcher bars come together."

      "headline":"Cut the trim pieces.",
      "description":"Align a length of quarter-round trim along the outside edge of the top stretcher bar. The flat side of the trim should align with the edge of the stretcher bar. Mark the trim with a pencil where you will need to cut it at 45-degree angles to match the cut of the top stretcher bar. Repeat aligning and marking the 3 other pieces of trim with the other 3 corresponding stretcher bars. Place the length of trim in a miter box. Use a hand saw to cut along the marked lines at the ends of the trim. Use the miter box and hand saw to cut the rest of the lengths of trim where you marked them."

    {
      "headline":"Attach the trim.",
      "description":"Align the flat outward edge of the top piece of trim with the outward edge of the top stretcher bar. The curved edge of the trim should face the inside of the stretcher frame. Hammer headless nails into the trim and stretcher bar. Space the nails at 4-inch (10.2-cm) intervals. Ensure that your nails are not longer than the total width of the stretcher bar and trim. Attach the other 3 pieces of trim to the other 3 stretcher bars. Ensure that the curved edge of each piece of trim faces the inside of the stretcher frame."
