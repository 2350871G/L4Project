          "description":"The first step to cleaning your tank is to empty all of the water from it. To do so, open the outlet valve or tap at the bottom of your tank and let all of the water flow out. Connect a hose to the open valve in order to direct the water to a location where it will not cause any localized flooding or erosion. Permanent water tanks have a washout valve that is located at the base of the tank. If your water tank is permanent and contains a washout valve, use this to drain the tank instead of the regular outlet valve or tap."

To do so, use a bucket to scoop as much water out as possible. Once the water in the bottom is too shallow to scoop with a bucket, use a plastic cup or coffee mug to continue scooping it out."

Remove the remaining water using one of the following methods:\nUse a wet/dry vacuum to suck up any water that remains. If you have a small tank and can safely tip it up, you can do this to drain any remaining water from the tank. Once you've got all but a very small amount of water out of the tank, you can use towels to soak up any water that remains."

          "headline":"Scrub the inside of the tank.",
          "description":"Use a bristle brush or abrasive sponge to scrub the inside of the tank, with or without your cleaning solution. Move your arm horizontally from side to side while applying a good amount of pressure on the brush or sponge. Continue doing this around the entire inside of the tank, until you remove as much slime and sludge as possible. You may need to use a brush with a long handle, depending on the size of your tank. This type of brush may be more difficult to maneuver, but will allow you to reach the bottom of the tank safely. If you're using a long-handled brush, you'll probably need to move the brush up and down vertically instead of horizontally. Avoid brushes with steel bristles or sponges made of steel. Plastic can scratch easily and these materials will probably be too harsh for a plastic tank."

          "description":"You can also use a power washer to clean the inside of your water tank. You can use the power washer by itself or in conjunction with scrubbing the inside of the tank, depending how tough the sediment and residue is to remove. Pressure washers come in a variety of sizes and strengths, but one with a pressure range between 1,300 and 2,400 psi works best for most household tasks. Follow these steps to clean the inside of your tank with a power washer:\nFill your power washer with water or cleaning solution. Start by holding it about four feet away from the surface you're cleaning. Move closer until you find the distance that works best for removing dirt, sediment, and debris. Hold the pressure washer so the water hits the interior wall of the tank at a 45 degree angle. Continue this until you are satisfied that you've removed all the dirt and sludge from the walls of your tank. Pressure washers are very powerful, so always wear safety goggles when you're using them, never point them at another person or animal, and follow all other safety regulations. It is also a good idea to have someone with knowledge of power washers give you a lesson on starting and using them before using yours."

Pour some of your cleaning solution into these pipes and hoses. Then, use your water pump to pump the solution through the pipes, removing any sediment and dirt inside them. Complete the same process with hot water until the pipes and hoses are free of detergent. Disinfecting the Water Tank Fill your tank three quarters full with clean water. Once you've scrubbed out the inside of your tank, you can then perform the process of disinfecting it. To start, use a hose to fill your tank three quarters of the way full with clean water.
