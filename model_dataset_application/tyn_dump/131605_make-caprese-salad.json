Making Caprese Skewers Skewer the cherry tomatoes on toothpicks. Stab the toothpicks through the centers of your cherry tomatoes. Slide the tomatoes into the middle of each toothpick so you have room to add the rest of your ingredients. If you don\u2019t have cherry tomatoes, you can dice regular tomatoes into \u20444\u2013\u20442 inch (0.64\u20131.27 cm) cubes. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half if you want smaller bites.

That way, they\u2019ll easily stay in place when you put them on your toothpicks. You can also push one end of the basil leaf onto the skewer immediately and fold it around the cherry tomato. Add the basil to each of your skewers. Push the centers of the rolled basil leaves onto each of your toothpicks. You can put the basil leaves on the top or bottom of the cherry tomatoes. Put an extra basil leaf on each of your toothpicks to give your hors d\u2019oeuvres more herbal flavor. Finish each of the skewers with a ball of ciliegine mozzarella. Ciliegine mozzarella comes in small, cherry-sized bites. Sandwich the basil between the mozzarella and cherry tomatoes to finish the skewers.Tip: If you can\u2019t find ciliegine mozzarella, cut fresh mozzarella into \u20444\u2013\u20442 inch (0.64\u20131.27 cm) cubes. Arrange the skewers on a plate and season them with salt and pepper. Space the skewers evenly on your serving plate with the end of the toothpick facing up. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over your skewers. You can make skewers the day before you plan on eating them, but the basil leaves may wilt. Mixing a Balsamic Glaze Bring 1  c (240 ml) of balsamic vinegar to a boil. Pour the balsamic vinegar into a shallow saucepan and put it on the stove over medium heat. Continue to heat the vinegar until it comes to a rolling boil. Reduce the vinegar to a simmer and cook it until it has a syrupy consistency. After the vinegar starts boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer. Continue to reduce the vinegar for about 15 minutes, or until it has the consistency of a thick syrup. Remove the glaze from the heat once it\u2019s finished. Dip the end of a spoon into the glaze to see if it sticks to the back. If it doesn\u2019t stick, continue to simmer the balsamic vinegar. Drizzle the balsamic glaze over your salad or skewers. Scoop up a small amount of the glaze in a spoon and drizzle it lightly over your Caprese salad or skewers.
