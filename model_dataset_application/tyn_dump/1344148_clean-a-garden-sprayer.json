Consider spraying next to or near where you were using the herbicide or pesticide since the chemical residue will be the same.

Fill the reservoir about halfway with this solution, and then spray the cleaning solution through the garden sprayer at least three times to flush the wand and the nozzle. Ammonia is effective for most herbicides, but not all. Research your particular herbicide to see if a bleach solution, powdered detergent, or kerosene solution would be better. A de-greasing liquid dish soap also works well, especially on petroleum based chemicals. You can also purchase a commercial tank cleaner at a hardware or home improvement store.
