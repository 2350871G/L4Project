  "text":" Frying Bread for an English Breakfast Cook the fried meal that accompanies the bread (optional). Fried bread is almost always eaten with one or more other fried foods, as part of an English breakfast. This often includes eggs, English bacon, sausage, sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, and baked beans. Fry them all in the same pan before you start your bread. If cooking all of the above, start the sausages first, the mushrooms a couple minutes later, then the other ingredients a few minutes later. Finish with the fried eggs. Add more fat or oil (optional). Depending on how much meat and butter you used in the fry-up, you might already have enough fat in the pan. But let's be honest: caloric introspection has no place when frying bread. Add a small knob of butter, a  splash of flavorful vegetable oil or, more traditionally, bacon drippings or lard. Heat the oil. Turn the stove on medium-high until the oil shimmers and gives off heat. A hot pan will keep the bread crisp, instead of weighed down by soggy grease. Add sliced bread to the pan. Slightly stale white bread is perfect, as the dry slice will soak up the flavorful oil more quickly. Save that fresh loaf of whole grain for the people who want toast instead.

If your pan was too cold and not sizzling, you may need to fry the bread for 15\u201330 seconds, but pull it out before it gets too soggy. Making Eggy in a Basket Cut a hole in a slice of bread with a cookie cutter or knife. You can use just about any type of bread for this method, as long as it can be sliced without crumbling apart. Cut a hole in the center of the bread using a cookie cutter, or cut out a shape using a knife. You can fry the cut-out shape as an addition, or nibble it while you cook. Use a heart-shaped cookie cutter for a romantic breakfast. If you use a knife, put the slice of bread flat on the cutting board, and use the tip of the knife in an up-and-down motion, perforating the bread with small holes rather than tearing through the bread directly. Heat butter or oil over medium-low. Add a generous amount of butter or cooking oil to a frying pan or skillet. Give it a minute to heat up, or a couple minutes if you are using an electric stove. It should be hot enough to give off a nice sizzle when you place the bread in. Don't use high heat, or the bread will burn before the egg is cooked. Place the bread in the pan. Make sure the butter or oil is spread evenly over the pan, then drop the bread slice onto it. Immediately move on to the next step. Optionally, add the cut-out section of bread as well, if it stayed in one piece. Crack an egg into the hole. Crack an egg directly into the hole at the center of the bread, from just above the pan. Add salt and pepper to taste. If serving guests, you can provide this on the dining table instead. Alternatively, cook alongside anything you would enjoy on an omelette. Try grating a few shreds of cheddar cheese and placing it over the cut-out bread shape. Flip the bread once the egg white is mostly opaque. You can cook your egg in your preferred style, but a runny egg will be easier, since the bread is less likely to char. After a minute or two, or until the egg white is mostly opaque, but still translucent in places, flip the egg and bread together with a spatula or cooking tongs. Finish frying and serve. Cook the other side of the eggy in a basket for another minute or two, until the egg white is fully cooked and firm, and the bread is brown. Now that the egg is more cooked, you can move the bread around the pan with the spatula, soaking up the butter or oil. Cooking French Toast (Fried Bread in Egg Batter) Slice your bread. Pre-sliced bread is usually too thin and too flavorless to make good French toast, sometimes called eggy bread or French-fried bread. Instead, slice a loaf of challah, egg bread, brioche, or other thin-crust, tight-crumbed bread into slices \u00be\u20131 inch (2\u20132.5 centimeters) thick. Ideally, leave a fresh loaf out overnight to make it slightly dry and absorbent; fresh bread should work fine if this is not feasible. \"Tight-crumbed\" refers to the interior of the loaf, which should be spongy and free from large holes. Beat together eggs, dairy, and salt. Before you start frying, you'll need a soupy custard-like batter that will envelope the bread in a golden envelope. To make enough batter for eight slices of French toast, beat together the following:\n3 large eggs\nPinch of salt\n\u2154 cup (160 mL) half-and-half. Substitute whole milk for a healthier alternative, or cream for an extremely rich dish. Use well-shaken buttermilk instead for additional flavor. Use less dairy for thin-sliced bread, or if your French toast ends up soggy. Mix in flavoring. French toast can be a sweet or savory dish. Flavor your batter accordingly:\n\nFor sweet toast, mix in 1 tbsp (15 mL) sugar and 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract. If you do not plan on serving the toast with maple syrup or another sugary topping, you can mix in an addition 1 or 2 tbsp (15\u201330 mL) sugar.
