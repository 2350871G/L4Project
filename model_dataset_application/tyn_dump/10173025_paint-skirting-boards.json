          "description":"This step is especially important if you are working with skirting boards that were previously painted with glossy paint. Rub fine sandpaper (180-grit) wrapped around a wood block in small circles on the skirting boards to create a rougher surface on the skirting boards that the paint will stick to. You don\u2019t have to entirely remove the paint that was there before, but sand enough so that the shine on the board disappears. Turn to 80- to 120-grit sandpaper if you want to get rid of bumps or imperfections (i.e. large globs of old paint). Sandpaper sponges also work great, especially for sanding surfaces (like skirting boards) that aren\u2019t completely flat."

Dip your sponge in this mixture and wring the sponge out in the bucket before applying it to the boards. Then, wash the wood with the sponge by starting at the bottom of the skirting board and using up-and-down strokes. Give it at least an hour to dry before moving forward.

If you\u2019re working with a shorter kind of carpet, insert a putty knife in the space between the carpet and the skirting board at an angle to push the carpet away from the wall.

Avoid using flat emulsion to paint, as this will result in skirting boards that can easily be marked up. In terms of gloss, go with semi-gloss paint (also sometimes called satin).
