Then, place the storm window over your regular window to easily seal out the draft. Storm windows can be an expensive fix for drafty windows, but you can use them again and again. Covering Windows with Plastic Purchase a plastic shrink wrap window kit. You can purchase a window insulation kit from a hardware store. These kits have everything you need to cover a drafty window. You can purchase kits with extra materials for covering multiple windows. The kit should include double-sided tape and plastic for covering your windows. You can buy these items separately if you prefer. Apply 1 strip of double-sided tape along the edges of the window. Start by pressing the end of the tape into the edge of the window just outside of the glass. Dispense the tape and continue pressing it until you have covered 1 side of the window. Then, cut the tape when you get to the end of the edge. Repeat to cover the other side and the top and bottom edges of the window. Remove the covering on the double-sided tape after 10 to 15 minutes.

Be careful not to cut inside of where you applied the double-sided tape or you may break the seal. Sealing Drafts with Caulk Hold a candle up to the window to find the source of the draft. Light a candle and hold it up next to the window. Move it around the edges of the window and watch the candle to see if it flickers. If you notice the candle moving like it is being blown in the wind, then this is probably a drafty part of the window. Mark it with a piece of chalk or tape.
