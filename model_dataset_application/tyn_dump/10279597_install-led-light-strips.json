Place lights on the bottom side of the cabinet if you want the light to focus on your countertops, though glossy counters will reflect the lights. Put the lights on the backside of the bottom lip to have the lights point towards your walls."

Use a pair of scissors or a sharp knife to cut along the lines. LED strips come in various cutting lengths, with common sizes being 2 inches (5.1 cm), 4 inches (10 cm), and 6 inches (15 cm)."

Slide the end of the strip into one end of a connector clip and snap it shut. Place a connector in the other side of the clip so the strip can lay flush along the corners. Connectors come either L- or T-shaped to link 1 or 2 more strips respectively. You can also bend the tape in the corners if you don\u2019t want to use connectors."
