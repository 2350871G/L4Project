If the player did not get 22 cards, add or discard as many cards from the selected pile into the central stack until you reach 22. Deal the Hand and Foot decks, 11 cards in each. With the pile of 22 cards that each player now has, they should deal them face-down into 2 piles of 11 cards. Still face-down, the player should then assign 1 of the decks as a 'Hand' deck and the other their 'Foot' deck. Once you have your Hand and Foot decks, you're now ready to begin the game. Understanding Melds Understand that the aim of the game is to get rid of your cards.
