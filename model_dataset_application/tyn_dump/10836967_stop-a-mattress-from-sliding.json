Stopping a Mattress Topper from Slipping Off Place a tight-fitting sheet over the mattress topper. Your mattress topper is more likely to slide around if your sheets are loose. Get the tightest-fitting bottom sheet you can find that will fit your bed and put it on to secure the topper in place. Use sheet suspenders or straps to hold the sheet and topper in place.
