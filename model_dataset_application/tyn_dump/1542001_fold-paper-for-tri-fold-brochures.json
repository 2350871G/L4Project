Most people make the cover on the front of the left side panel, but you can make it on the right instead. When you fold the brochure back up, fold the side with the cover last so that it ends up on top. Designing Your Brochure Digitally Create a new landscape style document with 3 columns. Open up a new document on a word editing program. Change the paper orientation to landscape style, then add 3 columns. Each of these columns (including the margins) will create 1 panel. Make sure that the paper size is set to 8 \u20442 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm). How you do this depends on the type of image editing program that you are using. Refer to the user manual/help section for your program. Alternatively, you can look for a tri fold brochure layout in the templates section of your word editing program. Choose a side panel to be on the inside of your brochure. A tri fold brochure is composed of 3 panels: a left, middle, and right. The left and right panels overlap each other. You can have either the left or right panel be on the inside; it does not matter. If you fold the left side of the paper first, that panel becomes the inside panel. If you fold the right panel first, then that panel becomes the inside panel. Make the inside panel narrower than the other 2 panels. Paper takes up space when it is folded. If you don't make 1 of the panels narrower, than the brochure won't look even once you fold it. Make 1 of the side panels 3.625 inches (9.21 cm) wide, and the other 2 panels 3.688 inches (9.37 cm) wide. You may be able to adjust the column widths using the settings. If you can't find it, move the sliders along the ruler at the top of the page. Add a second page for the back of your brochure. Your brochure will be composed of 6 panels altogether, with 3 in the front of the brochure and 3 in the back. You can write something on all 6 of these panels, or you can leave the back-center panel (panel 5) blank. Panels 1, 2, and 3 will be printed on the front. Panels 4, 5, and 6 will be printed in the back. How you add a second page depends on the program. Typically, you can just go to the bottom of the last column, and insert a page break. Double the margins between the columns. A \u20444 in (0.64 cm) margin may look pretty between 2 columns, but once you fold the brochure, those margins will shrink to \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) on each panel. This may be too narrow for you. Decide how wide you want the margins to be, then double that. Adjust the gutters (spaces) between the columns accordingly. How you do this depends on what word editing program you are using. In most cases, you'll have to look for \"columns\" in the toolbar. Refer to the help manual for your program. Create text and add images to your brochure as desired. Think ahead to how your brochure will look once it is folded. Panels 1, 2, and 3 will be on the inside of the brochure, and they'll only be visible once you open them. Panel 5 will be in the back-center. Panel 4 and 6 will be folded over each other. The one that you decide to put on top will make the cover. You can make panel 4 the cover or you can make panel 6 the cover. Print the brochure out. You will need to print the front out first, then print the back on the same sheet of paper. If you are using a top loading printer, you will need to flip the paper over so that the blank side is facing you. If you are using a bottom loading printer, simply feed the paper back into the printer, with the printed side facing up. If you are making multiple brochures, you can photocopy your original brochure to save printing time. Remember to use the double-sided photocopy option. Some printers have a brochure option. Take advantage of this. Fold the paper into a brochure. Turn the paper so that panels 1, 2, and 3 are facing you. Fold the narrower panel down first, then fold the outer panel on top of it. Make sure that the side edge of the outer panel touches the folded edge of the inside panel. Run your fingernail along the creases to make them nice and sharp. For more detail, refer to the process described in the previous method. Creating Other 3-Fold Brochures Create a simple tri fold brochure by overlapping the edges of the paper. Orient your paper landscape style. Bring the left and right sides of the paper towards the middle so that they overlap each other completely. Make sure that the side edges are aligned with the folded edges, then flatten the paper. Run your fingernail across the folded edges to sharpen them. Convert a tri fold into a z-fold brochure by folding the last panel back. Create a basic tri fold brochure, but make all 3 panels the same width.
