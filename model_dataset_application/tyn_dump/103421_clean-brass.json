If you are unsure of what your next steps should be in cleaning a brass piece, talk to a brass expert and discuss your cleaning options. Sometimes patina (the turquoise coloring that forms on brass and copper) can add a unique look to a piece of brass, and should be left alone.

          "description":"On modern brass pieces, an outer coating of lacquer serves as a layer of protection against oxidation. But, older, antique pieces of brass typically don't have a lacquered coating. You can assess if a brass piece is lacquered by looking at its surface: it will have a clear finish covering the entire piece. Brass covered with lacquer will usually only tarnish if there is a crack in the lacquer coating. Lacquered brass is fairly easy to clean; all you really need is some soapy water. However, you might want to consider removing the lacquering if tarnish has formed underneath the lacquer finish. If you are still having trouble figuring out if your brass piece has a lacquered finish, remember that lacquered brass usually has more of a yellow shading."

    "Hold a magnet near the brass piece and see if it's magnetically attracted to the brass.",
    "If the magnet does not stick, you are most likely handling brass.",
    "If the magnet does stick, it's likely that your \u201cbrass\u201d piece is actually a brass-plated piece of iron or steel.",
    "An alternative way to check if your piece is brass or brass-plated, is to use a sharp kitchen knife and scratch an inconspicuous part of the item.",
    "If the item is brass, the color in the scratch should be bright yellow.",
    "If the scratch mark is another color, like silver, then it is definitely another metal, and you still need to stick with non-abrasive cleaners so you don't remove the brass plating.",
    "Clean your lacquered brass-plated piece.",
    "Clean the entire brass-plated surface with a mixture of mild soap and cold to lukewarm water.",
    "Dip a cloth into the soapy water, wring out the cloth so it's only slightly damp, and gently rub the surface of the brass piece.",
    "Never try to polish lacquered brass.",
    "The polish tends to turn the surface of the brass piece cloudy.",
    "Don't use cleaners containing ammonia on lacquered brass pieces, because the ammonia will break down the protective lacquer.",
    "Clean your un-lacquered brass-plated piece.",
    "Dip a soft cotton cloth into a mixture of mild dish detergent and lukewarm water, wring out the cloth so it is only slightly damp, and gently wipe the surface of the brass piece clean.",
    "You can use an old toothbrush to clean out the nooks and crannies in the brass piece.",
    "Rinse and apply a mild polish.",
    "Rinse the brass piece with water, and dry it completely using a clean cloth.",
    "Polishing brass-plated items can potentially remove some of the brass plating.",
    "If you plan to polish your brass-plated object, do so very gently.",
    "It may be helpful to test the polish on an inconspicuous area of your brass-plated item before you polish the entire piece."
