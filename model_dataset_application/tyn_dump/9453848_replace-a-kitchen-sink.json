If the shutoff valves aren\u2019t under the sink, look in the basement. If you still can\u2019t find a way to shut off the lines directly, use the main water line valve. It\u2019s where the water line enters your house and will either be on the inside or outside. It\u2019s usually by the water heater and has a red handle. If you have city water, look for the valve near the water meter by the usage gauge. You can turn it off with an adjustable wrench. If you have well water, the valve by the pump can be turned off by hand. The water utility company can also help you shut off the water supply."
