Tape the back of the template on either end since you\u2019ll be cutting in the middle, then fold both template and cardstock in half together. Double-back tape by folding a piece approximately two inches long back on itself and sticking the adhesive side of one end onto the top side of the other, making a small loop with the adhesive side outward."

Make sure the scissors you\u2019re using are sharp and the blades are thin enough to handle fine line work.

After the glue dries, the shape will be secured and the other side will be able to move freely once you open the card. Only glue one side of the shape, and do not glue above the folded lines. A hot glue gun might work best for this task, or you might find a craft glue with a strong hold. Ordinary Elmer\u2019s glue will suffice but may eventually come unglued after drying."

It\u2019s alright if the pieces aren\u2019t perfectly aligned or the shape doesn\u2019t quite stand up on your first attempt. Try again until you have a neat, colorful handmade pop-up card. Decorate the card with markers, glitter, stickers or paint, then give it to a friend and watch their face light up! If your pop-up shape doesn't stand up correctly, it most likely means a slight mistake was made cutting the cupcake shape or gluing it down. Give it another attempt, making sure to cut the pop-up shape as precisely as possible and gluing only the folded edge of the underside to the base cardstock. Misaligning the candles at the top of the cupcake can make the pop-up shape look crooked and may prevent it from lying flat when the card is closed. Both candle halves should be perfectly superimposed before you glue them. It might be helpful to print out multiple copies of the original template in case you need a practice run or two."

  "text":" Cutting the Shape Print out a pop-up template. Run a quick search online for \u201cpop-up card templates\u201d to find a template you want to use for your card. There are many different kinds of templates available, so you\u2019ll have plenty of options. Try to find a template that is not too difficult to cut and glue correctly. For the purposes of this tutorial, follow along with the steps using  the birthday cake template linked here (PDF). Cut and fold the template. Cut out the cupcake section of the template and fold it along the center dashed line. This will serve as the base of the pop-up part of the card. Make sure you\u2019re cutting out the full, symmetrical portion of the template. The individual parts will be cut out later to decorate the pop-up shape. Some pop-up card templates will be a single shape, while others will include duplicates of certain shapes that can be cut out in different colors and superimposed over the pop-up shape to allow you to use different designs. Cut a piece of cardstock for the template. Choose a piece of thick cardstock in a color you want to use for the bottom of the cupcake. Place the template over this piece of cardstock and cut it slightly larger than the template. Once the cardstock is cut, fold it in half along the center as well. Use 65lb cardstock. This is thicker than paper, but not too thick to fold and open neatly. You can buy 65lb cardstock at any craft or office supply store. Attach the template to the cardstock.

Double-back tape by folding a piece approximately two inches long back on itself and sticking the adhesive side of one end onto the top side of the other, making a small loop with the adhesive side outward. Cut out the designated lines of the template. Follow the lines on the template to cut the cardstock for the pop-up shape. Cut the vertical lines at the bottom first, then move on to the outline of the shape. Be precise: this is the shape that\u2019s going to be displayed when you open up the card.

You may want to pick up some specialty crafting scissors, just in case, as conventional kitchen scissors may be too wide to neatly cut out small details. Attaching the Completed Shape to Your Card Fold the cupcake shape in half along the bottom. Find the dotted lines on the template that indicate where to fold along the bottom and use them to fold the cardstock shape you just cut. Accuracy is important while folding these lines. If the fold is messy or crooked, the card may not open or shut properly. There should be two folded edges when you\u2019re done, along with the original crease you made when you folded the template.

Remember to connect only the top halves of the cupcake; the bottom section should remain unglued to allow it to \"puff up\" when the card is opened. Layer Other Pieces Cut out the other individual shapes from the template. Return to the template sheet and cut out the remaining shapes.

You'll be using these template shapes to cut them of colored cardstock, like you did with the original pop-up piece, and layer them onto the pop-up portion of the card.
