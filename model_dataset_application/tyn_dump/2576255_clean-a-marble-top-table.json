          "description":"These types of particles need to be removed before you clean your marble with a liquid cleaning solution. If you don\u2019t have a dust mop, use a microfiber cloth or a feather duster to clean the tabletop. Avoid using a vacuum to clean dust and dirt off of marble, since the edge of the vacuum cleaner hose may scratch the sensitive marble surface. Even if you\u2019re not planning to use a liquid cleaner afterwards, you should still dust your marble tabletop at least once every 2-3 days just to keep it clean. Dirt can be abrasive and damaging to a marble tabletop, so it\u2019s best to do regular cleanings to protect your table."

          "headline":"Mix mild dish soap and warm water in a spray bottle.",
          "description":"Pour about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of gentle, non-abrasive dish soap into the spray bottle first, then fill it the rest of the way with warm water. Finally, place the spray head back on the bottle and shake it to mix the soap and water together. When you add the water, leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty space at the top of the bottle. This will ensure there\u2019s enough empty space in the bottle for the soap and water to mix. Don\u2019t use any dish soap that contains acids, alkalis, or any other abrasive chemicals, as these will most likely damage the marble. Stick to dish soaps that are marketed as being non-abrasive."

Avoid using too much of the mixture, since excess liquid may damage your marble. Although you\u2019re going to wipe all of the cleaning solution off anyway, if you spray too much on your marble to begin with, this makes it more likely that you\u2019ll accidentally leave some behind when you go to wipe it off."

Be sure to remove all the soapy water from the surface of the tabletop before proceeding. It\u2019s fine to leave ordinary water on the surface for now, since you\u2019re going to dry it off later. The most important thing to do right now is just make sure all the cleaning solution has been removed. For best results, use a microfiber cloth."

Rubbing the tabletop with a towel will also serve to buff the surface and give it a good shine. For best results, use a cotton towel. If you don\u2019t have a dry towel, you can also use a squeegee to remove the excess liquid."

Replace the bottle cap and shake the spray bottle vigorously to mix the 2 liquids together. Because marble is so delicate, it\u2019s best to use a very small amount of ammonia. Stick to \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of ammonia when you first try removing the stain. If this amount doesn\u2019t work, make a new solution and add a few more drops to it to make it stronger. You can buy these cleaning solutions at any grocery store that sells cleaning supplies. For darker marble, you can use acetone as an alternative to hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. Just dip a cotton ball in the acetone and rub it directly on the stain."

Stick to using a blotting technique for best results. Continue blotting until all of the cleaning mixture is removed. Don\u2019t leave any liquid behind on your tabletop, since it may stain the marble again."

Use a commercial stone sealer and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to apply the sealer. This will significantly help prevent future stains and watermarks from appearing. Note that applying a sealer will not protect your marble against etching. If you don\u2019t deep clean your marble at all, you should at least apply sealer to the surface once every 2 years."

Chemical paint strippers can damage the surface of the marble, so use those only if the stain covers a very large area or using a razorblade doesn\u2019t work.You can also try using a little lacquer thinner to remove the stain. If you have to use a paint stripper to remove a larger area of paint, purchase a \u201cheavy liquid\u201d paint stripper and follow the application instructions carefully. You may need to re-polish the tabletop when you are done. If you use a paint stripper or lacquer thinner, use only wood or plastic scrapers to remove the softened paint."

You can remove water stains by carefully buffing them out with steel wool. Make sure the steel wool is dry, and only use wool with a rating of 0000.0000 is an extra fine grade of steel wool.

Use cutting boards and plastic mats when handling food and other liquids on your tabletop to also prevent them from staining or damaging the marble. Cutting boards are especially important when you\u2019re working with acidic foods, like lemons, apples, or other citrus fruits. If you keep any small appliances (such as a toaster or coffee maker) on your marble tabletop, attach some felt pads to the bottom to protect the marble from scratches."

Don\u2019t sit or stand on your marble tabletop and avoid putting dense, heavy items (e.g., dumbbells) on top of it. This is especially important if your marble tabletop doesn\u2019t have a plywood backing (which most marble surfaces do not). Dropping anything heavy onto your marble will leave little white dots called \u201cstun marks\u201d that can\u2019t be removed, so avoid holding heavy objects over your marble, too."
