If the curtain has an odd number of eyelets, the edges of the curtain won't lay properly against the wall. Match the color and style of the curtains to the room that you are hanging them in."

Most rods should be thin enough to do this, but it wouldn't hurt to get the exact measurements. Check the packaging that your curtains came in. If you can't find the grommet size on the label, use a ruler to measure the inside width on 1 of the grommets. If you don't want to measure, a rod with a width between 1 \u20448 to 1 \u20442 inches (3.5 to 3.8 cm) will probably work for most eyelet curtains."

If the length you need falls between 2 standard sizes, choose the larger size. Matching the shade is important. A light silver rod won't look good against dark silver grommets.

Some curtain rods are sold at a set length, while others are adjustable. Take your final rod measurement from the previous section, and adjust the rod to that length. Make sure that you have an equal amount of extension on both sides of the window. Attaching the Curtain to the Rod Remove 1 of the finials from the curtain rod. Take the curtain rod off the brackets first, then unscrew 1 of the finials. Set the finial aside some place where you won't lose it. Weave the curtain rod through the grommets, starting from the front. Turn the curtain so that the front/right side is facing you.

Adding the Final Touches Move the curtain so that the outer grommets are outside the brackets. Lift the left side of the curtain rod and slide the curtain so that the first grommet is on the outside of the bracket. Set the rod back down, and repeat this step with the last grommet on the second panel. If you want to be able to move the curtain panel back-and-forth across the entire rod, the last grommet should be inside the bracket.
