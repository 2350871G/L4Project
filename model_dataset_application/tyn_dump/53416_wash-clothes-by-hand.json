Look for a liquid detergent that is made for delicate clothing. Brands like Woolite or Soak are good options.

This will make cleaning silk and lace clothing easier, and ensure the clothing is not damaged by too much rinsing. You can find no-rinse detergents online or in the detergent aisle at your local store. Popular no-rinse detergents include Eucalan and Persil."

Use a detergent with lanolin on any wool or fine knit clothing so they stay soft and do not get damaged during washing.
