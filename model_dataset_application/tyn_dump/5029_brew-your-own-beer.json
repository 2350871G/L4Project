Do not rinse iodine solutions, let equipment drip dry instead. Note that bleach can cause unwanted flavours in your beer, and requires rinsing, which can introduce microorganisms to your sterilized equipment. If you want to sterilize your equipment properly, use either a food-grade cleanser or sanitizer such as One Step No-Rinse Sanitizer, which requires no rinsing; or an iodine solution such as BTF Iodophor.
