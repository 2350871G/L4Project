Germinate the seeds in October or November and allow them to grow for a while and experience a winter. This may trick the flowers into blooming the following spring. If you live in a warmer climate, you may be able to plant the seeds outdoors in the fall and achieve the same results. In the U.S., hollyhocks can manage in USDA hardiness zones 3-8 (see http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/). In cooler zones (e.g., 3), you\u2019ll definitely want to start indoors \u2014 either the previous fall or early in the spring.

    "Hollyhock is prone to leaf fungal diseases, such as powdery mildew and rust.",
    "If you see leaves that are discolored or have a powdery residue on them, assume it\u2019s a fungus.",
    "Pluck off or pick up and discard these leaves, and disinfect your gardening tools frequently.",
    "Spray the plants with sulfur- or copper-based fungicide sprays, following the manufacturer's recommendations for use, if you see signs of discoloration or malformation of leaves or buds.",
    "Fungal diseases can quickly spread over an entire hollyhock plant or from plant to plant, so take action as soon as you spot trouble.",
    "Get rid of insects with insecticidal soap.",
    "Shake the soap well so it mixes with the water.",
    "Spray the soap onto the leaves in the early morning or late evening with a spray bottle.",
    "Cover the tops and the bottoms of leaves.",
    "As an alternative, mix 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of dish soap and 2 tsp (5.2 g) of cayenne pepper with 1 US pint (470 mL) of water and spray it on the leaves.",
    "Preparing for Next Year\u2019s Hollyhocks Harvest the seed pods if you want to collect the seeds.",
    "Wait until the pods turn brown and are completely dry.",
    "Then, pick the pods and separate the seeds from the thin, dry husk.",
    "Or, leave the pods on the plants and allow them to dry and open, dropping seeds for natural propagation.",
    "If your plant has shown any signs of a fungal disease, don\u2019t let the seeds fall and propagate.",
    "The fungus can spread to the soil and any new hollyhocks.",
    "Plant or store the hollyhock seeds.",
    "Once you\u2019ve picked the seed pods and separated the seeds out, you have three options:\nPlant the seeds in the same area of the garden if your hollyhocks did well in that spot, or just let them fall off the plant to the ground.",
    "Fall-planted seeds will winter over and germinate in the spring.",
    "Sow the seeds immediately in seed trays for indoor growing, if you want to start another cycle of indoor hollyhocks in hopes of getting blooms during their first year outdoors.",
    "You could also store the seeds in the refrigerator for outdoor planting (with or without starting them indoors) next spring.",
    "Help the plants through winter by cutting and covering them.",
    "Just before the first heavy frost, cut the plants down to ground level and cover them with a layer of mulch for winter protection.",
    "The root system will remain dormant until next spring.",
    "Cutting down the plants for winter is helpful even in warmer climates, and covering them may help keep bugs away.",
    "Some growers prefer to leave several inches of the plant intact and cover the stump with coal ash.",
    "The ash keeps moisture away from the stem and discourages snails and slugs."
