Typically, middle hinges go in the exact center of the door, top hinges sit 7 in (18 cm) below the top of the door, and bottom hinges rest 11 in (28 cm) above the bottom of the door. To make the installation process as simple as possible, use square-edged hinges that are either .25 in (0.64 cm) or .75 in (1.9 cm) thick. Look for door hinges at hardware and home improvement stores."

  "text":" Marking the Hinge Spot Place your hinge flush against the door. Position your door so you can clearly see the back edge.

If necessary, go over the lines multiple times until they are thick and easy to see. Score the outline with a utility knife. Once you\u2019re happy with the outline, remove your hinge from the door. Then, grab a utility knife and extend the blade to no more than .25 in (0.64 cm). Drag the blade along each of the pencil lines, creating small grooves you\u2019ll use later.

Line the wing up so it is perpendicular with the outlined spot and, if necessary, mark this position with a pencil.
