  "text":" Collecting Your Supplies Buy three thick planks of wood to build your board. You can use any wood you want, in any dimensions, but you should have at least 1\" thickness.

Make sure, as you apply the clamps, that the wood stays level. No pieces should \"buckle\" or push upwards. Ensure that the bottom or top is roughly even as well. Lift the clamped set of strips of the work surface, drying the wood glue so that it doesn't stick to the table. Lift the cutting board vertical and let it dry for the recommended time on the wood glue bottle. This should take 1-3 hours, but check the bottle for specifics. Finishing and Polishing the Board Remove the clamps and use a chisel to remove large chunks of glue. Take the clamps off once the wood glue dries. If there are any big chunks of glue on the board, lightly chisel them off now. Run the board through your planer. This gives it an even, perfect surface. You don't need to take much off -- only a few millimeters. Run both sides through for a perfectly smooth board. Taking off roughly a 1/8 on an inch from each side will generally get out any issues or imperfections. Use your table saw or miter saw to cut your edges to perfect size.
