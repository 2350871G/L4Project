  "text":" Wash and prepare all the vegetables. Start by measuring and counting the correct amounts needed and make sure all the ingredients are prepared. Use the peeler to peel the potatoes. Peeling is very important because leaving the skin on the potatoes can change the taste. Use the paring knife to chop all the vegetables. Take 2 of the onions, 2 potatoes, 8 mushrooms, 8 cloves of garlic, a tomato, carrots, and peas. Chop until they are nicely diced. They should all be similar in size. Separate each chopped veggie. Take the rest of the onions and delayer them. Each layer should make a hollow sphere shape when taken apart. Keep delayering them until there are no more sphere shapes to be able to be filled with rice. Wash the brown rice. After washing the rice, let it sit in water for about 1-2 minutes. This will help with cleaning the rice and help the rice soak up some water so it gets rid of some starch. Grab all of the diced vegetables and add them to a pan. As the rice soaks in the water for a little, turn the stovetop on medium heat and saut\u00e9 the vegetables with oil, spices, tomato paste, parsley, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
