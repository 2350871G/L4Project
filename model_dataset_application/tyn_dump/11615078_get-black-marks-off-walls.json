          "description":"Most scuff marks come off with water and a good scrubbing. Start by wetting a clean sponge or cloth with warm water. Wring it out so it\u2019s only damp rather than soaked. Start off rubbing lightly and see if the mark starts disappearing. If it doesn\u2019t start coming off right away, then gradually increase the pressure until it does. Then dry the area with a clean, dry cloth. If you have flat paint on your wall, make sure to squeeze the sponge out well. This type of paint isn\u2019t water-resistant, so you could strip the paint if you use a soaked sponge. Make sure the sponge or cloth you use is clean, or you could leave stains on the wall. Scrub in several different directions to hit the stain from multiple sides and remove it completely. If you\u2019re using a kitchen sponge, only use the non-abrasive side. The rough side could damage the paint. If water starts dripping down the wall, then the sponge is too wet and could leave water marks. Wring it out some more and scrub again."

Rub it into the sponge with your finger. Then scrub the scuff mark. Use increasing pressure to work the scuff mark out. Then wipe the area with a dry cloth.

Then scrub all the stained areas in a circular motion. A Magic Eraser can leave marks on flat paint, so don't use this product if you have flat paint in the area. If you aren't sure what type of paint you have, do a quick spot test. Scrub a hidden spot, like an area behind the couch, and see if the paint loses any of its shine or looks discolored.
