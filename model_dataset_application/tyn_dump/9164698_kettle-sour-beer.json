If the wort cools off too much, briefly turn up the heat or add a small amount of boiling water until it reaches the desired temperature once more. Try not to let the temperature of the wort drop below about 85\u00b0F (30\u00b0C). Doing so may result in a watery wort without much flavor.

Starting with a baseline acidity will create the most beneficial fermentation conditions possible and help the bacteria to do its thing much faster. Balancing the pH of your wort prevents other strains of bacteria from taking over and making the beer dangerous or unpleasant to drink.
