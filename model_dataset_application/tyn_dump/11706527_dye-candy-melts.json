If you\u2019re using a candy melting pot, turn your device to the \u201cmelt\u201d setting, or the highest temperature available. Stir the candy melts for about 10 minutes, or until the melts have completely liquefied. If you\u2019re using a microwave, heat your bowl of candy melts for 1 minute at 40% power. If your microwave doesn\u2019t let you change the power level, use the defrost setting instead. Search online or in your local craft store to find mini melting pots designed for candy melts. Use a double boiler if you don\u2019t have a candy melter or microwave."
