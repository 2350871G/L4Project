For a wall-mounted installation, add an additional 2 to 4 inches to each end to use as returns (also called the ends) for people to grab during use of the handrail. The rise of the railing should be measured according to local building authority codes; this is usually between 30-36 inches, or alternately at 36 inches, at the average height of people. Measure the rise at 36 inches from the same place at each step, and mark its position with a pencil or chalk. Use a tape measure to draw a straight line on the wall, connecting the 36-inch marks you placed at the top of the stairs in descending order to the very bottom step. Measure where you intend to place brackets that will later be screwed into the wall. Mark the bracket locations using a level to make sure that the brackets are plumb."

Wood is the most commonly used material for indoor handrails. Wood is sturdy and attractive, making it a good fit for indoor use. Wood is also an option for an outdoor handrail, but it may be prone to rotting in humid climates. Untreated wood will need an oil treatment before installation. Use tung oil, linseed oil, or a product based in one of those oils to coat the wood. Avoid water-based products because although they make wood water and moisture resistant, with time it peels and degrades. Metal railings are decay resistant and great for areas frequented by termite pests. Synthetic railings can be shaped and molded to your style needs and can even be made to look like wood. This option is expensive compared to other handrail options, but also more durable."

          "description":"To install a handrail using balusters, rather than installing one on a wall, you'll need quite a few materials in addition to the handrail you have chosen. If you're installing double handrails, one on either side of your set of stairs, double the quantity of supplies you purchase. Your handrail should be a 2x4 piece of wood that is no longer than 8 feet long, according to most building codes. Purchase two newel posts, the supporting posts that hold up the rail; you'll need one for the top of the stairs and one for the base. The standard size of a post is 4x4 inches and 5 feet long. Purchase one baluster per stair step. Balusters are the spindles that connect the rail to each step. The height of the balusters should be between 30 and 36 inches, depending on how high you want the railing to be. If there are already posts and/or balusters in place, count the total numbers of pieces you will need to replace, if any. For secure installation of newel posts, you'll need a post-hole digger and concrete mix to pour into the holes. Purchase sure-tite fasteners for secure installation of balusters in the steps. You'll need wood glue or epoxy glue to fasten the handrail to the posts. Depending on the style of railing you install, you may need additional reinforcement supplies, such as a finish nail gun and a screwdigger."

If not, you'll need to install posts before you can install your rail. To install a post in the ground, use a post-hole digger to dig a hole least 18 inches in depth in front of the bottom step. Fill the hole halfway to the top with mixed, wet concrete. Stand a newel post in the hole. If you're installing two posts, use a 4-foot level to stand on the top of both posts to ensure that they posts are perfectly aligned with one another vertically. Use the same level to ensure that the posts are horizontally aligned and level, too. Wait 24 hours for the concrete to set before installing the handrail. To install a top post to a wooden deck, place post over the stair stringer in a plumb position. Use four timber lock screws and wood glue to secure it into place. Finish it with finishing nails."

Make sure the balusters are lined up with the newel posts at either end of the stairs. Drill holes into each step, then thread the holes with sure-tite fasteners. If your balusters don't already have holes, you'll need to drill them. Drill a standard sized access hole into the bottom of the balusters. Into the side of each baluster, drill another access hole horizontally to intersect the first hole. Set each baluster, or spindle, onto the sure-tite fasteners on each step.

After allowing the glue to dry completely, use a sturdy paintbrush to apply a topcoat of primer onto the railing from the top down, ensuring that all surfaces and nooks are covered. After the topcoat dries, apply a second coat. If you wish to paint your stairs and railing, use an oil based paint because it preserves the wood grain while protecting the wood against harsh weather conditions. Use the same technique as the primer and topcoat when making the application. If staining is more your preference than painting, choose a wood stain that contains a deck sealer to preserve the look and feel of the wood."

    "Finish it with finishing nails.",
    "Install the balusters at the appropriate point on each stair.",
    "Balusters should be spaced no more than 4 inches apart.",
    "Use a pencil to mark the place where each baluster will be installed.",
    "Make sure the balusters are lined up with the newel posts at either end of the stairs.",
    "Drill holes into each step, then thread the holes with sure-tite fasteners.",
    "If your balusters don't already have holes, you'll need to drill them.",
    "Drill a standard sized access hole into the bottom of the balusters.",
    "Into the side of each baluster, drill another access hole horizontally to intersect the first hole.",
    "Set each baluster, or spindle, onto the sure-tite fasteners on each step.",
    "Tighten them down with a wrench.",
    "Attach the handrail to the newel posts and balusters.",
    "Apply wood glue or epoxy glue to the top of the posts.",
    "Fit the handrail into place.",
    "Wait 24 hours for the glue to dry before using the handrail, then secure the handrail and balusters together one at a time with a finish nail gun.",
    "For extra reinforcement, you can screw the handrail to the post with a Screwdigger, using a wood screw of 100-120 mm in size.",
    "Position the screw behind the post and make sure that it is going through both the posts and the handrail.",
    "Apply an exterior primer to your finished handrail.",
    "If the handrail is unfinished, finishing it is the last step.",
    "After allowing the glue to dry completely, use a sturdy paintbrush to apply a topcoat of primer onto the railing from the top down, ensuring that all surfaces and nooks are covered.",
    "After the topcoat dries, apply a second coat.",
    "If you wish to paint your stairs and railing, use an oil based paint because it preserves the wood grain while protecting the wood against harsh weather conditions.",
    "Use the same technique as the primer and topcoat when making the application.",
    "If staining is more your preference than painting, choose a wood stain that contains a deck sealer to preserve the look and feel of the wood."
