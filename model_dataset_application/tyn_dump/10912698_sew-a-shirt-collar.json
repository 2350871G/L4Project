To get the best results, work from a sewing pattern that includes a collar in the design and follow the pattern\u2019s instructions for how to cut, sew, and attach the collar. For example, you could go with a collar that has long, pointed lapels, or opt for a curved collar for something more delicate.Tip: If you are new to sewing collars, choose a pattern labeled \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201cbeginner.\u201d Avoid \"intermediate\" and \"advanced\" patterns since these will be much more complicated."

          "description":"Your sewing pattern should indicate what type of fabric you will need for the collar and specify if a special type of fabric is recommended. However, you can choose the color of the fabric that you want to make your collar. Use the same color fabric as the rest of the shirt if you want the collar to blend in, or opt for a contrasting color for a collar that will stand out. For example, if you are making a white shirt you could choose the same color fabric and make a white collar, or choose red fabric for a collar that will stand out. Make sure to pre-wash and dry your fabric for the collar. Otherwise, the fabric might shrink after you wash the shirt for the first time, and this could cause your shirt to become misshapen."

Lay the paper pieces on your fabric and pin them in place. Cut the fabric along the edges of the paper pattern pieces using a pair of sharp fabric scissors. Then, place the paper pattern on your interfacing and cut out 1 piece of interfacing for the collar. Be sure to cut around any notches that are included in the pattern pieces. These will help you line up the collar with the neckline later on. Go slowly and make sure not to create any jagged edges in the fabric."

Place a towel or t-shirt over the interfacing and iron over the interfacing and fabric to connect them. Check the instructions included with the interfacing to determine if you need to do anything special.
