For a dish or container, place a heavy metal object on top of the skewers to hold them down once the water is put in the dish. Wood skewers will float in water. A heavy metal object, such as a cooling rack or a serving spoon, will hold the skewers under the water and prevent them from floating."

In fact, some recipes may specifically direct you to soak the skewers for longer than 30 minutes."

The spray will prevent the meat and vegetables from sticking to the wood skewer, which in turn will help you slide the food off the skewers much easier. You can also spray non-stick cooking spray onto the barbeque grill to prevent items from sticking. However, do not spray the grill once the barbeque has been turned on.

The easiest way to do this is to put the same item on each skewer. For example, only put chicken on one skewer and only put peppers on another skewer. Vegetable and meat combinations that require the same cooking times are listed below. Chicken, pineapple, and onion. Swordfish, cherry tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers. Beef, onion, mushrooms, and bell peppers. Pork, mango, peach, and onion. Shrimp, pineapple, red bell peppers, and onions. Bacon-wrapped pork, red onion, and apples.

For meat that is less than 1\u20131.5 in (2.5\u20133.8 cm) thick, cut it into strips that are 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. Fold the strip in half when placing it on the skewer so the end result is a piece of meat that\u2019s approximately a 1 inch (2.5 cm) cube. Shrimp and scallops do not need to be cut, as they can each go onto a skewer whole."

This space will ensure each piece gets the proper amount of heat to all sides and is fully cooked. Kebabs that have all the food items push up against each other may not cook evenly.

The two skewers together will make the kebab lay flat and will prevent the kebab from spinning when picked up. Be gentle when pushing the second skewer onto the kebab as they can be delicate and may break if you apply too much force."
