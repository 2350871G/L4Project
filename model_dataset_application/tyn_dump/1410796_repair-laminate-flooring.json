For example, if you drop a knife and it leaves a small cut in the floor, you can easily repair the damage with a laminate floor repair kit.

Start at the side closest to the damaged board or boards. Carefully pry away baseboards and molding from the wall and pry thresholds up from any doorways with a pry bar.Tip: If you don't already have a replacement board, then you can remove the damaged board first and take it with you to a home improvement center or flooring supply store to help you find a matching one.

Gently tack them back into place with baseboard nails and a hammer using the same nails and holes as before. Use new baseboard nails if any of them got damaged when you pried them out earlier on. Replacing a Board in the Middle of the Flooring Draw a cut line in from each corner of the board and a rectangle in the middle. Mark a  1.5 in (3.8 cm) line along a straight edge with a pen or pencil in from each corner of the board diagonally towards the center. Connect the inner ends of the lines with straight lines to make a rectangle that you can cut out from the center of the board. This method works to replace a single damaged board in the middle of your laminate flooring, where it would be too difficult to replace by removing surrounding boards starting from an edge. Drill a relief hole at the ends of each relief cut line. Use a \u20448 in (0.95 cm) drill bit to make a relief hole at the inner ends of the lines you marked for the cut lines. Make another set of holes \u20444 in (0.64 cm) in from the outer ends of the relief lines. Make 8 relief holes in total so that you can cut in 2 phases\u20141 to remove the center section and 1 to remove the sides. Cut out the center of the board with a circular saw. Set the depth of the saw a bit deeper than the depth of the flooring. Lift the blade guard and plunge the saw into the board, starting at 1 of the inner relief holes. Cut from hole to hole in a rectangular pattern to connect the inner section of relief holes you made and remove the center section.Tip: If you don't already have a replacement board, then you can take this center cutout with you to a home improvement center or flooring supply store and buy a matching board. You will be left with the edges of the damaged board still connected to the good boards around them. Cut from the center to the outside of the relief holes. Cut with your circular saw from the middle diagonally out along the remaining cut lines. Stop when you reach the relief holes. This will separate the remaining edges of the board at the corners so you can remove them. Remove the edge pieces from the surrounding boards. Pry up each side where it is connected to a surrounding board with your hands or pliers if they are stuck. Discard these pieces. If there is any glue on the tongues of surrounding boards, then scrape it off with a flathead screwdriver before installing the replacement board. Remove the grooves from your replacement board. Your replacement board will have 2 tongues and 2 grooves. Carefully cut off the tongues and bottom lips of the grooves with a utility knife so that you will be able to drop the new board into place. To cut off the bottom lips of the grooves, sick the blade of the knife inside the grooves and cut them off from the inside. Make several passes with the utility knife to score the parts you are cutting off, then snap them off with pliers. Apply floor glue to the edges of the replacement board. Put a bead of floor glue along the edges where you cut off the tongues and underneath the top half of the grooves where you cut off the bottom lips. You can get floor glue at a home improvement center or flooring store if you don't have any. Fit the board into place. Match the top half of the grooves on your new board with the tongues on the surrounding boards. The board will now fall into place because you removed the tongues from the new board. If the board is not fitting right, then use your utility knife to shave off any rough parts until it drops nicely into place. Use a damp cloth to remove any excess glue.
