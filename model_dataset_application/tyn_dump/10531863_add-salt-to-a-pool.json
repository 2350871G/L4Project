Ideally, however, you should shop around for a product with 99% purity or higher. Swimming pool salt is typically sold in 40\u201380 lb (18\u201336 kg) bags. You'll most likely need at least 2-3 bags for a single treatment. However, it's a good idea to go ahead and stock up, as you'll be treating your pool periodically. High-purity salts dissolve faster and are easier for salt chlorine generators to process than lower-purity ones."

When the strip changes color, remove it from the water sample and compare it with the color chart displayed on the test kit's packaging to determine the salinity. The depth of the color will tell you approximately how much salt is currently in your pool. Like your salt chlorine generator, the concentrations indicated by salt test strips are given in parts per million. Get in the habit of checking the salinity in your pool at least 2-3 times a week to make sure your generator is operating at its targeted salt level.Tip: Keep in mind that salt test strips often have a range of error between 200-300 PPM. For a more accurate reading, consider purchasing a digital water quality meter from your pool supply vendor."

Most salt tables provide measurements in both pounds and PPM, which can make it easier for you to pour in just the right amount. For a 12 ft (3.7 m) circular pool that holds 3,000 gallons (11,000 l) of water, you'd need to add 87 pounds (39 kg) of salt, or about 2 whole bags, in order to bring it up to the recommended concentration.
