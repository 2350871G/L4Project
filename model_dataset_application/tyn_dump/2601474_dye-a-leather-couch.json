A basement, garage or outdoor driveway will provide a good place to work and keep chemical fumes out of your living space. You can also wear a mask to avoid breathing in fumes.

It's best to dye cushions separately from the couch itself, also over a drop cloth. You can also use old clothes or rags if they completely cover the space under your couch."

Lightly rub it with a cloth that you dip in the water and wring out. You can try to get any stains out of your leather at this point. If they are light, the dye will probably cover them up. However, dark, noticeable stains might make your final dye job look uneven. White vinegar or rubbing alcohol can get rid of most stains."

Place the tape as close to the edge of the leather as possible. If you need to, cut the painter's tape to a smaller size to make it fit in any small nooks and crannies."

You can remove this, along with any lingering oils, by using a clean rag to rub deglazer or acetone into the surface of the couch. It will evaporate almost immediately, leaving your leather clean and ready to dye. Some of the original dye may rub off of the leather as you deglaze it. You can buy leather deglazer online or at most hardware stores. Use acetone (not nail polish remover) for a less expensive but equally effective solution. Avoid using products with alcohol or mineral spirits, as these will dry out the leather."

A little bit of dye goes a long way, so don't use more than a few drops at a time, or the dye will drip and run down your furniture. Work in small sections at a time. For instance, do each arm, then each cushion, then divide the top and back into small, equal sections. Be sure to spritz each area with water before applying the dye. Wear gloves to protect your hands from the dye. Don't worry about trying to get an even dye job on the first coat. Any streaks or unevenness will be less visible as you apply more coats."

Most leather couches will need between 3 and 6 coats total. Let each coat dry completely before applying another. If you are attempting to dye a dark couch lighter, you might need to apply more coats. If you apply too much dye, it will look metallic or too shiny. To remove excess dye, soak a rag in rubbing alcohol and run it over the affected area. Keep in mind that no matter how careful you are, hand dying leather will result in a slightly uneven look.

Spray the finisher on the leather couch and rub it in with a damp, clean rag. Use long strokes to evenly coat the surface of the leather with finisher. Finishers usually dry in about 3 hours. You can move the couch back into your living space and start using it again once the finisher is dry. Leather finisher can be purchased wherever you buy leather dye. It may also be called leather top coat. Choose a glossy finish for more shine or satin finish for a more matte result."
