Taking care not to burn yourself, turn the wok so that all of it is exposed to the high heat. Dip a paper towel in oil and hold it between a pair of tongs. Rub the oiled towel over the wok. Uncoated carbon steel woks usually come with a light coating of oil to protect it from tarnishing or rusting. Scrubbing the wok will remove this coating before you're ready to use it."

Soaking your wok will loosen any food debris, making it easier to scrub off. Avoid extremes in heat when cleaning your wok to prevent warping your wok. For example, don't place a really hot wok into a sink full of cold water or you could damage the wok."

You can use your usual dish washing detergent to clean a nonstick wok. Place your wok in the water and let it soak if there's a lot of food debris on the wok. The sooner you wash your wok, the easier it will be to clean. Avoid letting your wok sit for long periods of time with food remnants crusted on it. Scrub the wok.

If your wok has a sticky layer from oil buildup, soak the wok in hot soapy water and scrub until the layer is removed. This may take multiple washes and rinses. Avoid cooking with metal utensils.
