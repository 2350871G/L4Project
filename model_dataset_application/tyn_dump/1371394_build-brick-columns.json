          "description":"This is where the footing, or foundation, of your column will be. It's important that you build the footing down into the ground as opposed to on the surface so that your column is stable. The depth and dimensions of the hole will depend on several factors, like the size of your column, how much weight it will support, and the kind of ground you're building on. If you're not sure, do some research online or consult with a professional mason. As a rule of thumb, the hole should be at least 12 inches (30 cm) deep. Make sure the hole is at least 4 inches (10 cm) longer and wider than your column will be so you have enough room to build the footing. Verify that the bottom of the hole you dug is level before you proceed. If it's not level, your brick column won't be either, so you'll want to level it first."

Then, place the frame in the hole you dug so it's laying flat on the bottom of the hole. Since you'll be using the empty inside of the frame to make your footing, make sure the frame is 4 inches (10 cm) longer and wider than your column will be when measured from the inside edges of the wood and not the outside edges. For example, if you want to build a concrete column that's 24 by 24 inches (61 cm \u00d7 61 cm), you'd want to make a frame that's 28 by 28 inches (71 cm \u00d7 71 cm) when measured from the inside edges of the frame."

Then, wait for the concrete to dry. How long it takes for the concrete to dry will depend on the type of concrete you use. Some concrete can take weeks to fully cure, while others are designed to dry in a few hours. If you want to speed up your project, try using a fast-setting concrete mix so you can pour the concrete and start working on your column all on the same day. Alternatively if the column isn't load-bearing or very tall, you can later bricks and more in an area 18 inches (46 cm) deep and 4 inches (10 cm) wider than the column."

Simply take all the bricks you'll use for the first course (the first layer of your column) and lay them on top of the footing so the ends are touching and they form a square or rectangle. Don't put a brick in the center of the course since the center of your brick column will be hollow. Also, leave a \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) space between each neighboring brick so you can connect them with mortar later on.

When you're finished, all of the bricks should be connected with mortar and evenly spaced apart. You want to make sure that you're applying an even layer of mortar to each brick so that your column has a uniform, balanced appearance when it's finished.

    "Otherwise, some of the joints could harden too much, and you might not be able to smooth them out.",
    "Use a masonry brush to clean your bricks as you build up so they look neater.",
    "Adding the Final Course Add a layer of mortar and wire mesh before the final course of bricks.",
    "Apply the mesh as you did throughout the rest of the column.",
    "Just spread a thin layer of mortar over the top course, put down the mesh, and top it with another thin layer of mortar.",
    "Don't skip this step.",
    "You'll need the wire mesh to help support the final course of bricks, which will have an extra brick in it.",
    "Lay the final course of bricks, but add an extra brick in the center this time.",
    "Since this will be the top of your brick column, you want to cover the hole in the center so it's not visible.",
    "To add the center brick, wait until you've put down the first 2 bricks in the final course.",
    "Then, lay the center brick and finish the rest of the course.",
    "Smooth out any remaining joints before the mortar dries.",
    "If there are any joints you haven't smoothed out yet, wait until they harden to the point where they resist minimal pressure.",
    "Then, use your jointing tool to scrape off the excess mortar so they're flush with the bricks.",
    "Be careful you don't wait too long or the mortar could dry and you'll lose your chance to smooth out the joints.",
    "Top your brick column with a capstone if you want a polished finish.",
    "A capstone can be brick, concrete or stone, and it's put on top of a brick column to give it a nice, finished appearance.",
    "If you're interested in adding a capstone to your column, get one that's around 3 inches (7.6 cm) longer and wider than the column.",
    "Then, spread a layer of mortar on top of the column and center the capstone on top of it.",
    "You can also make a brick capstone by using bricks that are larger than the ones you used in your column.",
    "Cut your bricks in half and lay them with their sides facing out for added strength and visual appeal."
