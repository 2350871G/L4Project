    "Loosely cover the bowl and set it aside.",
    "You really should use wheat starch for this dough if at all possible.",
    "Use tapioca flour in a pinch, but know that the final appearance and consistency will vary slightly if you do.",
    "Mash the cooked taro root.",
    "Let the taro cool for about 5 minutes, then transfer it to a separate bowl.",
    "Use your fingers or a fork to mash the taro into a thick puree.",
    "Discard any pieces that still feel hard.",
    "Combine the dough, taro, and remaining ingredients.",
    "Place 1 cup (250 ml) of mashed taro into the wheat starch mixture.",
    "Add the salt and sugar, as well, and mix with your fingers until evenly blended.",
    "Add the lard or shortening after that.",
    "Work the lard into the dough using your fingers.",
    "You'll need to knead the dough for several minutes, or until it takes on the consistency of mashed potatoes.",
    "Refrigerate the dough.",
    "Gather the dough into a ball and cover it in plastic wrap.",
    "Refrigerate for at least 1 to 2 hours.",

    "Roll each piece into a ball.",
    "If the dough seems warm and soft after you finish rolling out the pieces, chill the dough balls for another 10 to 15 minutes before continuing.",
    "Indent the center of each wrapper.",
    "Flatten each dough ball into an oblong circle and use your fingers to form it into the shape of a bowl, with a shallow indentation in the center.",
    "It might be easiest to form and fill each dumpling one at a time instead of trying to shape the wrappers all at once.",
    "Fill the dumplings.",
    "Place 1 tsp (5 ml) of filling in the center of the wrapper.",
    "Fold the wrapper around the filling and pinch the edges in place.",
    "Each dumpling should be shaped like an egg or almond.",
    "Use excess dough to patch any holes that develop as you form the dumplings.",
    "Heat the frying oil.",
    "Pour 2 inches (5 cm) of canola oil or peanut oil into a heavy saucepan with deep sides.",
    "Heat over medium-high until the oil reaches a temperature between 360 and 370 degrees Fahrenheit (182 to 188 degrees Celsius).",
    "Test the temperature using a cooking thermometer.",
    "The oil must be hot enough before you add the dumplings; otherwise, the dough will fall apart as it cooks.",
    "Fry the dumplings.",
    "Add the dumplings to the hot oil and fry until they turn golden-brown.",
    "Avoid crowding the pan by only cooking two or three dumplings at a time.",
    "Once the dumplings begin to float, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking them.",
    "After 2 or 3 minutes, the dumplings should be done.",
    "Serve hot.",
    "Remove the dumplings from the hot oil and let them drain on clean paper towels for several minutes.",
    "Serve them while they're still hot.",
    "Method Three: Longan Tofu (Soy Jelly)[7]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Place longans into each serving container.",
    "Open the canned longans and place two or more in the bottom of each serving dish.",
    "Use 6-oz to 8-oz (180-ml to 250-ml) pudding cups for this recipe.",
    "Reserve 2/3 cup (150 ml) of longan syrup after removing the longan fruit from the can.",
    "Any remaining syrup can be discarded or used for another purpose.",
    "Heat the sugar, water, and pandan leaf.",
    "Combine the sugar, pandan leaves, and 3 cups (750 ml) of water in a medium saucepan.",
    "Heat on medium until the water boils.",
    "Pandan leaves are mainly used for their fragrance.",
    "Use them if you can find them, but if you're unable to find them, you can leave them out of the recipe and the jelly should still set.",
    "Consider adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of vanilla extract or almond extract, instead, to prevent the jelly from tasting bland.",
    "Tie the pandan leaves together into a tight knot before adding them to the mixture.",
    "Mix together the agar-agar and remaining water.",
    "In a separate small bowl, mix the agar-agar powder with the remaining 1 cup (250 ml) of water.",
    "Stir the two ingredients until the agar-agar seems fully dissolved.",
    "Combine the two mixtures.",
    "Pour the agar-agar mixture into the boiling sugary syrup.",
    "Stir well and continue to cook it over medium heat.",
    "Allow the contents of the saucepan to reach a boil after combining the two mixtures, then simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes before turning off the heat.",
    "Add the milks and syrup.",
    "Pour the soy milk, evaporated milk, and reserved longan syrup into the saucepan.",
    "Mix well until evenly distributed.",
