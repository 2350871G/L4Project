For your inlay, you can use any thin, flat material, such as wood veneer, mother of pearl, or a small cut of bone or ivory. One dark and one light material will create a pleasing contrast and make gaps between them less noticeable."

          "description":"You may already have a piece in the size or shape you desire. If not, saw it into a simple shape. Wear a respirator dust mask whenever you saw mother of pearl or other material that produces dangerous, sharp dust. Any type of sharp, well maintained saw will cut mother of pearl, but you should periodically dip the mother of pearl in water to prevent burn marks. Limit yourself to simple freehand cutouts or tracing small geometric designs. See the instructions for complex designs if you want something more ornate."

          "description":"You can use double-sided tape or a tacky glue that takes a long time to set. This will keep the inlaid piece steady for you to trace and cut around. Alternatively, you can trace your piece onto tracing paper and tape that onto the base. Particularly simple pieces which take little time to trace can be held in place manually if they are large enough to hold without cutting yourself."

          "description":"Using an x-acto knife or other hobby knife, cut into the traced lines. Start by lightly scoring the wood to get a groove going. Once the groove is established, you can cut further down with less risk of your knife slipping along the wood grain. Only cut into the wood just deep enough to fit the entire inlaid piece. If you end up slightly shallow, you can sand the inlaid piece down. If you end up too deep, you'll have to sand the entire wooden surface to make it flush."

          "description":"Now that the edge is established, you can make a recess where the inlaid object will fit. Be careful not to cut too deeply. Small simple designs can be recessed using hand tools such as a router plane, chisel, or sharp knife. Larger or more intricate recesses will be faster and easier to create with a power tool such as a Dremel, laminate trimmer, or full size router. If you used double sided tape, you may need to wiggle a putty knife or other flat, wide blade beneath the inlaid object to pull it away from the base."

Optionally, you can sand the edge of the inlay at an angle to create a wedge, narrower at the bottom than the top. This makes it easier to fit without revealing any gaps. Rarely, your piece will fit so well you can't get it out again. In this case you can brush a thin layer of clear glue over the inlay for additional strength and let the tight fit do the rest."

    "Make the side of the piece smooth and even so it will fit well with the other pieces and the base material.",
    "Temporarily attach the piece or template to the base.",
    "Place the piece onto double sided tape and run over it with your fingernail to make sure the tape is completely adhered and smooth.",
    "Remove the paper backing and attach it to the traced wood base where it belongs.",
    "Alternatively, you can use a long-setting glue.",
    "This should hold it steady but not attach it permanently to the base while you cut an outline.",
    "If your double sided tape is too weak, try to find the type called \"turner's tape\" at a craft store.",
    "Once it's in place, use a utility knife to cut off the excess tape so you can see what you're doing.",
    "Cut lightly around the piece, then remove the inlay.",
    "Use your utility knife to lightly score the outline of the piece, then deepen the groove slightly.",
    "Use a thin, flat putty knife to wiggle the piece off of the tape or glue.",
    "Be careful not to break it or damage the base.",
    "Trace the groove to make it more distinct.",
    "Use pencil or chalk to make the groove clearly visible, then erase the surrounding lines.",
    "Erase across the groove, not along it.",
    "Remember not to erase the marks you'll need to place the next pieces.",
    "Set up your cutting tool.",
    "A full strength router is the most stable way to cut out a recess for your inlay design.",
    "If one is not available, use a Dremel with a router attachment, or a lighter, less stable router such as a laminate trimmer.",
    "Set the depth of your cutting tool a hair smaller than the height of your inlay piece \u2013 just by one millimeter or 1/32 of an inch.",
    "Cut away most of the recess with a 1/8\" drill bit (3.0 or 3.5 mm).",
    "Remove the wooden base to the specified depth, but stay away from the outline.",
    "That requires a more precise bit.",
    "Cut to the edge using a 1/16\" drill bit (1.5 or 1.6 mm).",
    "Replace the drill bit with a smaller size and very carefully approach the outline of the recess.",
    "Stop as soon as you reach the groove.",
    "When you stop seeing dust and rough, frayed wood appear at the surface, stop immediately.",
    "You've reached the groove you created.",
    "This is much easier to see with a magnifying headset.",
    "Glue the piece in.",
    "Liberally apply glue to the base of the recess and use a brush to ensure it covers the sides as well.",
    "Use a wood glue for veneer.",
    "Use an epoxy or other strong, specialized adhesive for a different inlay material.",
    "Slightly sanding the edge first will create excess sawdust to mix with the glue and disguise its appearance.",
    "Once the piece is wedged in flush or almost flush with the surface, smooth the glue into the gaps with your finger.",
    "Clamp in place and let dry.",
    "Clamp the inlay to something the glue won't adhere to, such as a wooden block covered with tape.",
    "Leave it in place for 4\u20136 hours or for however long your glue takes to set.",
    "Level the surface.",
    "Remove hardened excess glue and make the inlay flush with the object's surface by using sandpaper, an inlay scraper, or a block plane.",
    "For mother of pearl or abalone, polish additionally with 300 grit sandpaper after flattening the surface with a coarser grit.",
    "Cut and place additional pieces.",
    "Move on to your next labeled segment and follow the same process to cut out that piece and inlay it.",
    "Remember, your previous piece was intentionally large to make a flush, overlapping effect once you've cut into it for the piece above it.",
    "Remember only to make oversized pieces on edges that will be underneath another segment.",
    "The other edges should fit your design as precisely as possible."
