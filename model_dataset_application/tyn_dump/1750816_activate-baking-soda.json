Vinegar is probably the most common way to activate baking soda.. The reaction can turn the baking soda into a powerful cleaning agent. For example, vinegar and baking soda can be used to clean a kitchen sink. Add \u00bc cup of warm tap water and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of vinegar into \u00bc cup of baking soda to see if the baking soda is still good. If it bubbles, it is. This is called \u201cproofing\u201d the baking soda. Vinegar will create a powerful fizz when added to baking soda because of the degree of acidity in it. It's the acetic acid in the vinegar that causes the chemical reaction."

Add a teaspoon of baking soda to a glass of mineral or other water, and add in the juice from half a lemon. Mix thoroughly before drinking. Some recipes call for adding peppermint leaves or a pinch of salt into the lemon and baking soda mixture, in addition to water. This mixture has purported health benefits. Some people believe it can be used to combat acidosis. The mixture helps the body remove toxins and burn fat. It can be helpful for kidney care. Drinking lemon juice and baking soda can also improve your digestion and combat acid reflux. It helps to purify your liver and provides some needed nutrients, like vitamin C. Always check with your doctor, though, before using any natural remedies."

Try adding orange juice to baking soda, and you will get bubbles that come from the release of the carbon dioxide. Fruit purees also activate baking soda. Orange juice has more acid in it than most other fruit juices. Other juices that will react to baking soda include grape juice, vegetable and fruit juice blends, and limeade. Ketchup can react with baking soda because it contains vinegar. The acidic reaction will cause fizzing that indicates the baking soda is fresh and actively working."

When baking soda interacts with acidic substances such as those above it creates sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide bubbles give rise to baked goods. Follow the amount of baking soda specified on the recipe. Make sure that you do not substitute baking soda for baking powder as they are different! Sour cream, yogurt, and molasses also create a bubbling reaction in baked goods. Add one teaspoon of baking soda or follow the recipe\u2019s directions. The addition of the baking soda will cause an instant reaction if one of these acidic ingredients is present, so that the batter will expand when the batter is put into the oven. This in turn will cause the batter to rise, creating a lighter texture to baked goods like cookies, quick breads, cakes, and muffins."
