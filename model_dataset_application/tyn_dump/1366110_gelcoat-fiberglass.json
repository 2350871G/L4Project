You\u2019ll want to take care of any damage on the fiberglass first so you have a smooth surface to apply the gelcoat to. To fill in damaged areas, start by sanding them with coarse 36 grit sandpaper to remove any debris. Then, fill in the damaged areas with the polyester filler using a plastic spreader. Let the polyester filler cure until material is firm and tack free, about 10 minutes. Sand it down with 80 grit sandpaper until it\u2019s flush with the surface of the fiberglass."

If you\u2019re cleaning a large fiberglass surface, like the hull of a boat, use a power washer to make the process easier and faster, be very careful, as a power washer can actually cut fiberglass and blow chunks right off surface."
