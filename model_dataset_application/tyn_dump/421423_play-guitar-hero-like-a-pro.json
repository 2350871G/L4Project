When beginning, you will notice a bar coming down, with five colored targets at the bottom. You will then see colored circles moving down the screen. Match up the colors with the targets, and hold that fret button. When the color passes over the target, strum! Voila'! You've hit a note! Sometimes, notes will be repeated. Instead of releasing the fret button each time, simply hold it down and strum. Guitar Hero controllers are just like real guitars, especially in the way they are played."

You hit this the same as a regular note, but you hold the fret button for the entire note. You do not need to hold the strum bar down. Once again, just like a real guitar! Hooray for similarity!"

The one of the left is your score multiplier, which shows your points, note streaks, and multiplier. On the right sits your rock meter. This meter shows what the crowd thinks of you (RED = Poor, YELLOW = Average, GREEN = Good/Great). If your rock meter declines too much, you will fail the song. On top of the rock meter is a number of lightbulbs. These measure your star power. When they are yellow, your star power cannot be engaged, but when its blue, it can be engaged."
