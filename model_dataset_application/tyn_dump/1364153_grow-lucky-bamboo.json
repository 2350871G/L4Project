Ultimately, it's up to you and will likely be determined by the pot or vase you have available. If you do go the stone route, the container should have enough stones or marbles in the bottom to stabilize it. The lucky bamboo will need at least 1 to 3 inches (3-8 cm) of water to thrive. If you want to grow it in soil, well-drained, rich potting soil is best. It needs to stay moist but not soaking at all times. Use organic fertilizer when needed; salts and high phosphorus concentrations in synthetic fertilizers can cause deterioration. Also, you can be sure your soil drains well by simply adding some small rocks to the bottom of the pot."

If you want to control the curl of your plant, use a three-sided box (a box with a side cut out). The plant will then bend toward the light.
