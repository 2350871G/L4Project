          "description":"Before you begin draining your water heater, you will first need to find the main power source and turn it off. The breaker box or fuse box is usually a small, grey power panel (about the size of a shoebox) with a swinging door. It is often attached to a wall. In some homes, it is located in the garage and in others it can be on the outside of the house. The thermostat for the gas heater is usually a red knob located on the outside of the heater where the gas pipe enters the unit. The knob should have 3 settings: \"Pilot,\" \"On,\" and \"Off.\""

These are called \"branch circuits breakers,\" and they provide protection against electrical overload to different circuits powering your house. If you know which branch circuit breaker is powering your water heater, turn this individual switch off. If you don't know which individual circuit breaker is powering your heater, locate a larger switch labeled \"Main\" above the branch circuit breakers. The main circuit breaker should have higher amperage values like 100, 150, or 200. The branch circuit breakers will have lower numbers from 10-60amps. Turn the main power off, but know that all the power to your house will be shut off for the time-being. If you open the box and find round, glass topped shapes or small tubes with metal ends, you have a fuse box, not a breaker box. In this case, you will need to unscrew and remove the fuse that is powering your water heater (similar to turning off the branch circuit breaker). If you are unsure of which fuse to remove, look for a large rectangular box with a handle/lever at the top of the panel.
