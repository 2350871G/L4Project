  "text":" Removing Old Paint or Stain Set up your working area. Cover the floor with a drop cloth to keep dust and whitewash off of it. Open screened windows and doors to provide ventilation.

The simplest way to whitewash is to water down white paint. Oil-based paint works, but it may not be as easy to use. You probably don\u2019t want paint with a high gloss, but it\u2019s up to you. Go to your local hardware, paint, or home improvement store. Since you are watering it down anyway, don\u2019t buy expensive paint. Dilute the white paint with clean water.

If you use oil-based paint instead of water-based paint, thin it with turpentine (paint thinner) instead of water. The same ratio and process applies. Mix the whitewash completely with a paint stirrer. Since the two liquids are such different thicknesses, they won\u2019t mix totally on their own. Stir the paint with figure eight motions until the water is totally combined with the paint. Scrape the excess paint off of the stirrer and set it aside. Test the whitewash on a small section of trim. Dip the brush into the whitewash and paint a foot (30.5 cm) or so of trim. If it looks good, move onto painting the whole thing. If the whitewash looks thicker than you want it to be, add more water and mix it again. Remember to add the water a little at a time so the whitewash doesn\u2019t become too thin. Applying the Whitewash Use a brush that\u2019s slightly narrower than the trim. Pick out a paint brush that covers the majority of the width of the trim in one swipe, without going past the edges. This will help you paint quickly without accidentally getting whitewash on the walls or doors next to the trim. For example, for four inch (10.2 cm) wide trim, use a three inch (7.6 cm) or 3 \u00bd inch (8.9 cm) wide brush. If the trim is more than four inches (10 cm) wide, stick with a brush that is less than four inches. Brush on the whitewash carefully. Use back and forth strokes of the brush that go parallel with the grain of the wood. The whitewash will be runny, so hold the bucket close to the trim so you don\u2019t drip it all over. Catch paint runs quickly with a rag so they don\u2019t get onto other surfaces. Pay attention to the results as you go.
