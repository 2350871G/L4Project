You can divide people randomly, such as by having them draw their role out of a hat or choose team captains and have them pick their team members 1 at a time. This game is best for teens and adults as it involves traveling over a long distance and hiding along the way."

The fugitives, drivers, and chasers will all start at point A and travel towards point B. The first fugitive to reach point B is the winner of the game. If you\u2019re playing fugitive in your neighborhood, then you might make your backyard the starting point and make a local playground the ending point. You may also want to set some ground rules before the game begins to specify what areas are and are not okay to travel through. Be careful not to play fugitive in areas with a lot of traffic. Choose side roads and quiet streets in residential areas to travel through."

If the chaser tags the fugitive, they are out and they will have to get into the car with the driver and chaser.Tip: If you don\u2019t want to incorporate cars into your game of fugitive, give the cops flashlights to distinguish them from the other players.
