With that in mind, you will most likely have to clean the fan at some point. This should be done whenever it becomes noticeably louder than it was when you first used it. Ideally, this shouldn't happen until a year has passed. If it happens sooner, the fan should be cleaned despite the loss of warranty, in order to prevent the console from overheating."
