          "description":"A wet saw is the best option for cutting stone slabs, and the diamond blade ensures a smooth, clean cut. If you only need to cut marble for a few jobs, renting may be more cost-effective than buying a saw. If you are planning multiple home improvement jobs, buying your own saw may be more economical and convenient. Make sure you get the right kind of wet saw. If you're cutting pieces of marble that are more than 15 inches (38 cm) in diameter, a tabletop wet saw (the kind most commonly available for rent) will not be effective. Ask an employee at the store to recommend the best saw for the job you want to do. If you're cutting a thin slab (like the kind you'd use for a shower wall or counter top), you can use a circular saw with a diamond blade. A new wet saw usually costs about $100-300 (\u00a377.25-231.76). Renting wet saws cost about $35 (\u00a327.04) a day or $100 (\u00a377.25) a week. The blade of the saw has diamond crystals, which help cut dense and strong items."

When you move the marble across the platform of the saw, the foam gets scratched up, rather than your marble. You can make the cutting job easier by attaching the foam to a piece of \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) plywood. Use clear silicone to attach the foam to the wood, and wait for the silicone to dry before cutting. You can then lay the board on a saw horse so you can cut at a comfortable level.

To tell which side of the blade is correct, make a practice cut on a scrap piece of marble. Make sure to keep the marble clamped down so that it can't move while you make the cut.

Turn on the saw when you are ready to use it, feed the marble slowly into the saw until you reach about 1\u20133 in (2.5\u20137.6 cm), and then stop.

Continue cutting the rest of the way through the slab to ensure your cut is clean and even. If you're cutting a very thin slab of marble, like the kind you'd use to cover a shower wall, there's no need to flip the marble and make 2 cuts.

Start with 120-grit sandpaper to soften the edges at first, and then use 2500-grit sandpaper for an extra-smooth finish. If you use a coarse sandpaper, you'll scratch the marble. To wet your sandpaper, hold it under your faucet for 3-5 seconds. Using wet sandpaper may make it easier to sand the stone surface. For an automatic option, try using an angle grinder to quickly smoothen the marble. However, you may have less control over the sanding process if you use a machine.
