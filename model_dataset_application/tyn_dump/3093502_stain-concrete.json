          "description":"Look closely for large cracks, chips, crumbling sections, and other signs of damage. Repair moderate damage by filling cracks with a self-sealing concrete crack sealant or putting down a new, thin layer of concrete over heavily worn areas. Stains have a way of accentuating flaws in the surfaces they\u2019re applied to. This means that any imperfections in the concrete may become more visible by the end of your project. If the surface you plan on staining is severely deteriorated, you may want to consider laying new concrete."

          "description":"One gallon of concrete stain should be enough to cover 200\u2013400 square feet (19\u201337 m), depending on how heavily it\u2019s applied. For best results, pick up enough stain and sealer to apply 2 coats of each, which will offer more even coverage and superior protection. You\u2019ll find concrete stain and sealer in the paint aisle of any hardware store or home improvement center. Concrete stain is formulated from a semi-transparent base with pigment mixed in, similar to traditional house paint. If you like, you can pick up stains in 2 different colors to give your work surface a marbled effect. Simply use a lighter color as your base coat, then layer a darker shade on top to create depth.Tip: Bring home samples of any stain colors you think you might want to try out. It\u2019s always a good idea to test a stain before covering your entire work surface."

If you opt to use a specialty concrete cleaner instead, be sure to choose a product that\u2019s suitable for the type of concrete you\u2019re staining. pH-neutral cleaners, for instance, are recommended for removing dirt and light stains from sealed concrete surfaces.

    "Layering your coats in this way will ensure that every last crack, crevice, and depression gets filled with the sealer.",
    "Be careful not to slather on either coat too thick.",
    "Doing so could cause bubbles or large larger blisters to form in the cured finish.Tip: It may help to walk backwards with the roller to avoid stepping on the section of concrete you just rolled.",
    "Allow the sealer to cure for 24 hours.",
    "Curing is different from drying, as this is when the sealer will harden to its true finish.",
    "After a full day, your concrete surface will be ready to use!",
    "If you choose to seal your work surface, it will be important to apply a fresh coat of sealer every 3-4 years to keep it looking its best."
