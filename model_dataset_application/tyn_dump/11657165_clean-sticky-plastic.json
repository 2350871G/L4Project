Add an equal amount of water, then stir the mixture with a spoon until it turns into a paste.Warning: Don\u2019t use this method to clean something like the keys on a plastic keyboard because the paste could get inside easily and damage the electronics. The amount of baking soda and water you need to use depends on how large the plastic item you want to clean is. For example, if it is something small, like a TV remote, you can use about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water and 1 tbsp (20 g) of baking soda. This method works to clean a variety of sticky plastic items like plastic kitchen utensils or dishes, TV remotes, plastic containers, toys, and many other types of solid plastic items."

Add more paste as needed until you have covered the whole surface of the sticky item. Don\u2019t use anything abrasive like a scouring pad to scrub the paste onto the item because you could scratch the plastic."

Wipe away all the paste from the plastic item. Rinse out the cloth and repeat as needed until there is no more paste on the plastic. If you are cleaning something with batteries, like a TV remote, make sure to open up and wipe out the battery compartment as well in case any paste got inside. If the item has any cracks or crevices that you can\u2019t wipe the paste out of, you can use something like a toothpick or cotton swab to reach inside them and clean the paste out."

If you don\u2019t have a cloth you can use, fold up some paper towels or napkins instead. This method works well to clean off adhesive residue, such as that left behind by stickers or glue. If you are cleaning off an old soft plastic coating that has become sticky, keep in mind that the appearance of the item will likely be shinier and slightly different after you wipe it off with alcohol. However, it won\u2019t be sticky anymore after you remove the deteriorated coating."

Quickly tip over the mouth of a bottle of alcohol onto the middle of the cloth to dampen it and tip the bottle back again before too much pours out and soaks the cloth. Note that if you are using this method to clean a plastic item that has crevices or sensitive parts, such as a keyboard, make sure the cloth is just barely damp so no alcohol will drip down into any cracks. Be very careful to just wipe down the non-sensitive plastic surfaces like the tops of the keys on a keyboard. You can also use rubbing alcohol for this, as it contains isopropyl alcohol."

Rub the alcohol all over the plastic surface to clean it, turning the item in your hand as needed to reach all sides of it.Warning: Keep in mind that alcohol can remove the color from certain types of colored plastic. Test the alcohol out on an inconspicuous area of the item to see if it removes any color before applying it to the entire surface. Scrub firmly in back and forth or circular motions, paying special attention to the areas where the item is most sticky. Alcohol evaporates very quickly, so you don\u2019t need to worry about drying the item off after you clean it."
