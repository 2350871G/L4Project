  "text":" Making the Macaron Shells Sift the dry ingredients together. In a medium-sized bowl, sift the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and almond flour two times only. Set aside for later use. Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat the whites on medium speed until they're foamy. Fold in the cream of tartar and keep blending.
