    "If you don\u2019t see a change, you may need to re-pollinate the flower.",
    "Harvesting Vanilla Beans Pick the pods when they begin to turn yellow at the bottom.",
    "The pods will appear within 2 months of pollination, but they take 6-9 months to mature.",
    "During this time, care for the plant as you normally would.",
    "Then, when the pods, normally green, are just starting to turn yellow, carefully pluck them off the plant.",
    "Blanch the beans for 2-5 minutes in 158 \u00b0F (70 \u00b0C) water.",
    "Heat a pot of water to 158 \u00b0F (70 \u00b0C).",
    "Submerge the beans for 2-5 minutes, then carefully remove them.",
    "This kills any germs or bacteria, and also prepares the beans for curing.",
    "Sweat the beans for 36-48 hours in a blanket-lined box.",
    "After blanching the beans, transfer them to a box lined with a blanket.",
    "A bamboo box and woolen blankets are best, but you can use whatever you have on hand.",
    "Allow the beans to \u201csweat\u201d inside the blankets and box for 36-48 hours before removing them.",
    "The beans will sweat out moisture due to the heat, helping them to dry out.",
    "Alternate drying the beans in the sun and sweating them for 7-14 days.",
    "Spread your beans on trays and place them in direct sunlight for 3 hours each day.",
    "Then, fold them in a cloth or blanket and put them in a box to allow them to sweat overnight.",
    "Repeat the process of drying and sweating each day until the pods turn a deep brown.",
    "Allow the beans to air dry for 8-20 days at 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C) and 70% humidity.",
    "To further remove moisture from the beans, they should be allowed to air dry fully.",
    "Hang them up or spread them out on trays in a drying room.",
    "Keep the room at 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C) and 70% humidity for best results.",
    "The beans are done drying when they have a soft, leathery texture and lots of length-wise wrinkles."
