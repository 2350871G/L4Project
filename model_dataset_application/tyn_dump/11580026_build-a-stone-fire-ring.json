Proceed to lay out the fire ring with 11 more blocks, adjusting them as you go to make them fit neatly together in a perfect ring. You can adjust the number of blocks if you want to make the fire ring bigger or smaller. You can use concrete retaining wall blocks for a basic, more economic option, or some kind of natural stone for a fancier, more rustic-looking ring. Avoid porous rocks like sandstone and limestone because they can explode easily when they get hot."

You\u2019ll have to remove any grass sod and dig down into the ground to create a foundation for the pit, so this also gets that process started for you.

  "text":" Excavating the Site and Laying the Foundation Choose a flat site in an open area, away from anything flammable.
