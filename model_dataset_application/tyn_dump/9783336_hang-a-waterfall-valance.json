  "text":" Preparing Your Rod and Valances Measure the width of your window to determine your curtain rod length. Use a tape measure and measure the top edge of your window. Write down the measurement and purchase a rod that is 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm) longer than the width of your window. Mark the areas on the wall where you want to install the curtain brackets. Measure from the top of your window to the floor. Use a tape measure and measure the distance between the top edge of your window frame and the floor. This will help you determine the size of the curtain panels that you'll use to surround your waterfall valance. Install a double-curtain rod or 2 individual rods for a layered effect. If don't have any rods installed, use a double curtain rod. Mark 4\u20138 inches (10\u201320 cm) on the left and right side of the top edge of the window. This will be where you install your brackets. You can purchase a double-curtain rod online or at a hardware store. Install a valance rod if you already have a curtain rod installed.

Hold the valances you plan on using side-by-side and decide if you like the color combination. Hang your curtain panels on the inside rod. Before you hang the waterfall valance, you can hang the 2 side curtain panels that will hang to the floor. Thread the top of the panels through the inside rod and push them to the left and right side of the rod. Layering Valances onto a Rod Thread the left side of the first valance onto the rod. There should be an opening on both the left and right side of each of your valances, and you\u2019ll use these to layer your curtains. Push the rod through the opening on the top of the first waterfall valance. Gather the fabric to the left side. Push the top of the valance down the curtain rod and bunch up the fabric on the left side of the rod. Doing this will give you more room to add the additional valances to the rod. Add the second valance to the rod. Take the left side of your second valance and thread it through the rod as you did the first one.

Take the right side of the second valance and thread it through the right side of the rod. This will create the waterfall effect that you\u2019re trying to achieve. Attach the right side of the third valance onto the rod. Finish hanging your curtains by attaching the final valance\u2019s right side to the end of the curtain rod. If you did everything correctly, the valances should be layered on top of one another. Connect the rods together if you're using a detachable rod. Connect the right and left sides of the rod together and space out the valances so they don't look crowded. Your rod is now ready to be hung back onto the window. Making the Finishing Touches Hang the rod on the curtain rod brackets. Once you\u2019ve attached the valances to the curtain rod, place it back on top of the curtain rod brackets. Look at the valances and decide whether the color matches the door frame and other elements nearby. If you don\u2019t like the way it looks, unthread the curtains from the rod and use different color combinations until you achieve the look you want. Style the folds in the curtains. The folds in the curtains should be evenly spaced apart for a clean look. Even out the creases with your fingers and try to make them look uniform. This will enhance the way the curtains look. Pull the tops of the valances up. Pull on the top of the valances to remove any folds and creases and to give the top of your curtains a neat look.
