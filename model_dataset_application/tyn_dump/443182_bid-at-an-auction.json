It is useful to ask how long the auctioneer thinks it will take to get through the lots too. Most importantly, make sure you understand all the payment instructions and requirements before registering for an auction. Writing a personal or travelers check or using a credit card is not the same as cash. Many auction houses only accept cash. Many auction houses add a buyer's premium and local taxes (such as general sales tax), so be prepared to pay more on top of the winning price. Find out in advance."

      "description":"Most auctions today require that anyone intending to bid be pre-registered with the auctioneer and assigned a bidding number. This bidding number is usually written on a card that the bidder can hold into the air, signifying to the auctioneer of the intent to bid. The registration is on-site. If you do not register and receive a bidder number you will not be allowed to bid. While allowing a bit of privacy for bidders, it enables being recognized as a bidder by the auctioneer. The auctioneer will announce the number of the winning bidder along with the winning amount."

      "headline":"Be clear when making bids.",
      "description":"Call out, put your hand up, flash your bidding card, etc. Basically, do whatever is effective in calling attention to your bid. If the auctioneer misses you, repeat your action until he or she sees you. The fall of the hammer constitutes the sale. A bidder can withdraw a bid prior to the fall of the hammer but not after; after, a contract of sale has been formed. If the hammer falls and you made a bid but the auctioneer did not see you, dispute the sale and ask for the bidding to be reopened. The auctioneer does not have to comply but if others saw you bidding and back you up, you might succeed. This is why it is important to be clear about bidding."
