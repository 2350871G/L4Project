When you cut the flower stems, do so while they are submerged in water. You can fill up a shallow basin of water for this purpose. Cutting them in water ensures no air gets into the stem. Use very sharp shears or scissors to avoid pinching the stem instead of slicing it neatly. You want to cut each stem at around a 45-degree angle.
