Then, push 1 end of the thread through the eye of a sewing needle and tie a knot in the opposite end of thread. To easily make a knot, wrap the end around your finger and roll the loop between your fingers a few times. Pinch the rolled thread and pull it tightly to secure the knot."

This brings the jersey knit fabric together so the hole isn't noticeable.Tip: If you're mending a hole that's larger than \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) in size, cut a swatch of jersey knit fabric in the same color as your item so it's about 2 inches (5.1 cm) larger than the hole. Then, place it over the hole and use a running stitch to stitch the swatch to the surrounding fabric. Avoid pulling tightly or you'll make the fabric pucker noticeably."

If you cut the excess thread right at the knot, you risk cutting into the knot."
