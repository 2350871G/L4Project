          "description":"Select a photo that shows dimension easily, such as a person standing in front of a building or monument, or a dog running on a beach with the sunset in the background. It\u2019s also a good idea to choose a photo with shapes that will be easy to cut out and aren\u2019t too detailed. In the examples mentioned, the photo of the person might have 2 layers, the person standing and the building. In the second example, the dog is the first layer, the beach is the second layer, and the sunset is the background. Shapes that are easy to cut out include people and buildings with clean lines or simple flowers. Difficult objects might be the Eiffel Tower, a leafy tree, or an intricate chandelier."

          "description":"Once you\u2019ve chosen the picture to use, print out duplicates yourself or have copies made in the exact same size and color, as well as using the same paper. Decide how many layers your picture will have beforehand to make the right number of copies. For example, if you chose a picture of a person posing in front of the Statue of Liberty, your layers might be the person posing, the statue, and the background, meaning 3 copies are needed. Make extra copies just in case you make a mistake. Create as many layers as desired, though 2-4 is ideal."

Scissors work well for softer edges, while a sharp craft knife works better for more intricate details. This is the layer that pops out the most."

Continue cutting out the rest of the layers, leaving the last photo whole, as this will be the background and doesn\u2019t need to be cut. Use the cutting board for each layer to avoid damaging any surfaces while using the craft knife."

Leave the protective backing on the adhesive once it's attached to the layer for now. Use 2-5 small pieces of foam adhesive on each layer. Use smaller foam squares for the smaller sections and larger ones for the larger sections of the photo. Look for a double sided adhesive foam tape at a craft store or big box store."

Line up the first layer so that it\u2019s directly on top of the second layer and the images overlap perfectly. Once the first foam piece is attached in the right place, remove the rest of the protective backings from the foam adhesive to stick the layer securely. Remove just one of the protective foam backings at a time to ensure the images are straight first. For example, if the first layer is a cutout of a flower vase and the second layer is the photo with the flower vase and a kitchen table, line up the flower vases so that they\u2019re directly on top of one another."

Line up the images and edges of the photo to create a whole picture that pops out in 3D.

If the finished picture doesn\u2019t fit in the frame, trim the edges of the 3D photo using scissors or a craft knife and a ruler until it fits well. Using Photoshop and 3D Glasses Take a photo of a stationary object looking through a viewfinder. Stationary objects are easier to work with since it's necessary to take a second picture that looks the exact same, though it's possible to take a picture of a person if they hold the same pose for both pictures. Use your left eye to look through the camera\u2019s viewfinder before taking the picture. A building, food item, or plant are all good examples of a stationary object to use. Use the center focus of the viewfinder to aim while taking the picture. If your camera doesn\u2019t have a viewfinder, like if you\u2019re using a cellphone, this is okay. Snap another picture of the object using your other eye in the viewfinder. Instead of using your left eye to look through the viewfinder, now use your right eye to take the photo of your object. It\u2019s important to keep your head stable, only moving the camera from your left eye to your right. If you\u2019re taking the picture with a camera that doesn\u2019t have a viewfinder, shift the camera over 3 in (7.6 cm), keeping the same focal point, distance, and angle. The picture you took first will be called the left photo and the second picture you took will be the right one. Upload both pictures to your computer and open them in Photoshop.

Use another photo editing software as long as it lets you adjust the red, blue, and green color channels, if desired. Copy the right picture over the left picture. Select the right picture and then select the layer. Drag the layer on top of the left picture and then release it. After you do this, one photo that has 2 layers will be left: the right picture is \u201cLayer 1\u201d while the left picture is \u201cBackground.\u201d\nTo select the layer, click on the \u201cLayers\u201d tab under the right side bar. Alter the red channel so that the blending option is disabled. Do this by double clicking on \u201cLayer 1\u201d and looking under \u201cBlending Options.\u201d Click on \u201cAdvanced Blending\u201d and then \u201cChannels\u201d before finding the \u201cR\u201d standing for \u201cred.\u201d Uncheck the \u201cR\u201d and then press \u201cOK.\u201d\nOnce you do this, the colors in your photo should change to look like the 3D images.

To move the layer around, use the move tool that\u2019s in the upper left corner. Use your 3D glasses to look at the photo and see if the focal points line up well.

Put on your 3D glasses and view the photo. If you haven\u2019t made your 3D glasses yet, find a pair of clear, plain glasses and color one lens red and the other lens blue. Put on the glasses and enjoy your new 3D photo! It doesn't matter which lens is blue and which is red.",
