  "text":" Planning and Layout Check the local regulations or ordinances governing fence building at your location. Also review your homeowners association covenants, if applicable. Observe the following regulations for fences:\nrequired setback from your property boundary\nmaximum height\nobstruction of sight on thoroughfares\nzoning restrictions\n\nThese may vary for the particular fence type, so it is best to contact your local building inspection department and your homeowner's association before you finalize your plans. If you are not absolutely sure where the property line is located, it is prudent to have a site survey done before you layout the fence line(s). You might also want to check with your neighbors to make sure that they are okay with the particular fence you plan to install. Get the required permits. You might need a local building permit, so check with local authorities before starting your project. You may be required to get a COA (Certificate of Appropriateness) in historic districts. This type of fence will, typically, not fall within the guidelines for a historic district, though. Locate all underground utilities. Call a local locator service if you are not absolutely certain that there are no underground utilities crossing your proposed fence line(s) or if you do not know their location(s). Layout the fence line(s). Sketch a site diagram if necessary. Include the structures, trees, underground utilities and any potential obstructions. Make sure to consider the terrain and any large trees or obstructions. Either go beside the obstructions or plan to remove them. Plan to step-down and step-up the slopes-- each fence section will be level, with the top edge of the panel horizontal. Preparing the Fence Line(s) Clear the fence line of trees, shrubs and vines.  Mark the fence line(s) on the property. Drive pegs into the ground at either end of the proposed fence line(s). Run a mason's line to ensure the fence is perfectly straight. The line gives you a guide as you set your fence posts and erect the panels. Setting the Vertical Posts Mark where you would like to dig your holes. Follow the spacing recommended by the manufacturer of your fence. Dig the holes for the fence posts. Use a post hole digger, auger or a double ended shovel. Depending on the soil type, you may have to dig the hole shallower or deeper. A good rule of thumb is to dig each hole 600mm (two feet) deep. Place your posts (upright) in the holes. Make sure they are plumb and in-line, then provision temporary bracing to keep them in position as you dry fit the fence. Dry fit the panels. Use two or three panels held in place with temporary fasteners (removable clamps). As you work your way along the fence line(s), prepare the grade, excavating and filling as needed.

Alternatively, the caps can be put on before the panels are secured to the posts and rails. Another option is to set the posts a bit high and plan to cut the top off of each post. Replumb the posts and secure them to the temporary bracing.  Mix the concrete according to the instructions on the bag. If you are using Portland cement, you will also need sand and aggregate (most often medium size gravel). Pour the cement into the holes. Stop at least one inch below ground level. Allow the concrete to set. The curing time will depend on the particular mix and on the dampness of the ground. One day should be adequate, but allow two or more days if it fits your schedule. Installing the Horizontal Rails Screw on your rails, making sure they are level, or in the event you are following a sloping grade, keep the same height.  Space your rails according to the fence manufacturer's recommendations. For an ordinary fence 48\" to 60\" tall, a bottom rail 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the panel bottom and a top rail 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the panel top is sufficient. For taller fences, an intermediate rail is needed, centered between the top and bottom rails. Lap or butt the rails together on the post, depending on the rail design. You can fasten these with No. 12 self-drilling screws or 1/4\" bolts with nuts and lock washers. Securing the Panels Install the caps prior to securing the panels if you have decided to leave the posts shorter than the panels.  Screw on the steel panels. Ensure that they are plumb and level or sloping uniformly to match the existing grade. Some types of metal panel fencing is designed to overlap, while other panels are installed with spacers, and yet another type has narrow vertical panels staggered on opposite side of the rails. Installing the Caps Cut off the top of the posts. This will not be necessary if you set your posts to the proper depth before you poured the concrete. Install the caps (if you haven't already). Tap the caps into place using a hammer and wooden block to prevent damaging their coating/paint. Cleaning up and Landscaping Clean up the site and tools, then put away your tools. Recycle or reuse excess material. Perform any grounds keeping and landscaping. It is best to keep plantings away from the fence as they tend get larger and will hinder fence maintenance.",
