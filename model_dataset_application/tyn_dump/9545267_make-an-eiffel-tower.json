Do not use photographs; the trees, people, and buildings will get in in the way. Do not use a drawing that includes more than 1 side of the Eiffel tower.

If you found your drawing in a book, you may be able to enlarge it using a photocopier. If you found your drawing online, then use an image editing program, such as Photoshop or Paint, to make the drawing bigger.

Transfer your template to the cardboard directly and skip the plastic cover. Do not use thin cardboard that is only white on the outside and brown on the inside. Have several craft blades handy.

    "Create additional pieces, such as the roof and railings, if desired.",
    "Whether or not you do this depends on how detailed you want your Eiffel tower to be.",
    "Use the same method as you did when creating the sides of the tower: start with the outline, then fill it in with vertical or crisscrossing lines.",
    "When making the roof, create each of the 4 walls and 4 roof triangles separately.",
    "Assembling Your Model Glue the base pieces together to form a square.",
    "Draw a line of glue along the inside edge of your first base piece.",
    "Place the next piece against it to form a right angle.",
    "Glue the final 2 pieces to complete the square.",
    "Make sure that the top and bottom edges are aligned.",
    "Use hot glue or super glue for paper, wood, and pasta models.",
    "Tacky glue will work, but you'll need to hold the pieces until they dry.",
    "Use hot glue for hot glue models.",
    "Work 1 side at a time, or the glue will set too fast.",
    "Repeat the process for the middle and top sections.",
    "If you need to, use cans, bottles, and blocks to support the pieces as they dry.",
    "If you a hot glue model that is all 1 piece, skip this step.",
    "Stack and glue the 3 sections together.",
    "If you made platforms and railings, glue them down to the top of the base and middle sections first.",
    "Let them dry, then stack and glue all 3 sections together.",
    "Skip this step if your model is all 1 piece.",
    "Glue on any additional railings.",
    "If you made additional pieces, such as railings, you should glue these on as well.",
    "Make sure that you align the railings with their designated places on your template.",
    "The bottom edge of each railing should align with the side edges of each side piece.",
    "Use a fast-setting glue for this, such as super glue or hot glue.",
    "A thick glue, such as tacky glue will also work, but you will need to hold the piece until the glue dries.",
    "Assemble the roof, if you made it.",
    "Glue the walls for the roof together to make a square first.",
    "Next, glue the top of the roof to make a pyramid.",
    "Glue the pyramid to the walls.",
    "Let it dry completely, then glue the entire piece to the top of your tower.",
    "If you made a tower out of hot glue, you can make a small, triangular mount using hot glue, then glue it to the top of your tower.",
    "Add the spire to the top.",
    "Use a toothpick for wood or cardboard models, and a thin noodle for pasta models.",
    "Glue the spire to the top of your model with a thick or fast-setting glue.",
    "Super glue, tacky glue, and hot glue are great options.",
    "You may have to hold the spire for a few moments as the glue sets.",
    "If you made a hot glue model: draw a thin line of hot glue on a piece of plastic, parchment paper, or wax paper.",
    "Let it harden, then peel it off.",
    "Glue it to the top of your tower."
