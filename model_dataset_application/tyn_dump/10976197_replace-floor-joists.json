If you\u2019re not sure what type of joist you have, take pictures of one from several angles and show your photos to an employee at your local home improvement store. An I-joist consists of 3 parts: a horizontal piece of lumber on the top, an identical piece of lumber on bottom, and a central web in between, which is usually made from plywood."

Insert a wood-cutting blade into your saw when sawing through wood, and a metal-cutting blade when sawing through nails. This process is quite difficult and will take some time and muscle. Be patient and experiment with using different tools to see which ones work best. Once the joist is completely detached from the subfloor, put it away somewhere where it won\u2019t be underfoot."
