          "description":"To get the zipper back on, you will need to expose some of the fabric at the end of the zipper. Pull the zipper teeth off one at a time using a pair of pliers. Keep removing teeth until you have exposed about 2\u201d to 3\u201d (5 cm to 7.6 cm) of the fabric. Expose the smallest amount of fabric necessary to get the zipper pull back on. If you have a large zipper pull, then this will be closer to 3\u201d (7.6 cm). If you have a small zipper, then you may be able to expose only an inch or two. Consider the status of the zipper before you pull off the teeth. If the zipper is open, then you will need to pull the teeth off at the bottom of the zipper. If the zipper is closed, then you will need to pull the teeth off at the top of the zipper. Make sure that you expose the same amount of fabric on both sides of the zipper as well. If the sides are uneven, then you may not be able to get the pull back on."

If the zipper was closed, then slide the pull onto the fabric right side up, so that the pull is directed towards the zipper."

If it is crooked or not moving, then you may need to start over and try again. Make sure that you do not zip the zipper off the track again before you secure the end with a new top stop or square tab."

Top stops are small pieces that go on one side of your zipper.

Top stops are best for the top of your zipper because they will prevent the slider from coming off again, but they will not prevent you from opening and closing the zipper. Square tabs (also known as zipper bottom stops) are best for the bottom of a zipper because they will prevent the zipper from coming off and cover the gap in the zipper left by the missing teeth."

The zipper will need to be slightly open for you to do this. After you have the top stop where you want it to go, use the pliers to crimp the top stop into place. Make sure that the top stop is snug and will not move or come off when you pull on it. Place a top stops on both sides of the zipper to ensure that the zipper will not come off of the track again."

Insert the prongs right below the bottom teeth of the zipper. Make sure that the zipper is closed when you do this. After pushing the prongs through, turn the garment or fabric over and use your pliers to bend the prongs inward.
