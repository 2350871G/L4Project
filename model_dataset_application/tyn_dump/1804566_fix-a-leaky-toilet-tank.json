Fixing a Fill Valve Leak Turn off the toilet\u2019s water supply and remove the water from the tank. Turn the water supply valve in back of the toilet all the way clockwise to turn off the supply. Remove the water from the tank by flushing the toilet once the water\u2019s been turned off. You can also use a cup or a shop vac to get the water out of the tank.

Once the water supply has been turned back on, flush the toilet to test the new fill valve. If it fills correctly and doesn\u2019t overflow, it\u2019s fixed. If you\u2019re still experiencing problems with water leakage, your toilet may have a more serious problem. Call a plumber to have them diagnose the problem and see if it can be repaired. Tightening Leaky Gaskets Turn off the water and empty the water out of the tank. Turn the water supply valve behind the toilet clockwise to turn off the water supply. Once the water\u2019s been turned off, flush the toilet to empty out the tank. You can also use a cup or a shop vac to get the water out of the tank. Locate the bolts in the tank that connect the tank to the bowl. These are the 2 or 3 bolt heads surrounding the flapper in the bottom of the tank. You\u2019ll recognize the bolts by the rubber washers underneath them. Use an adjustable wrench and screwdriver to tighten these bolts. Use a flathead screwdriver to hold the bolts in place.
