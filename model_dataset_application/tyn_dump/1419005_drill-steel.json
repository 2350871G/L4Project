If the clamp is loose, the metal could spin while you drill it and cause you harm. If you\u2019re working with a heavier piece of steel, you do not have to clamp it down. If you\u2019re drilling through a painted surface, put stir sticks or shims between the clamp and your piece of steel so the clamps don\u2019t dent or scratch the metal."

The smaller drill bit puts less pressure on the metal and allows you to drill larger holes easier later on.
