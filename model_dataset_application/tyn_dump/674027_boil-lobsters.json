Store your lobster in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days at most. In the freezer, lobster lasts for 2 to 3 months. After de-thawing frozen lobster, you can store it in the refrigerator for another 3 to 4 days prior to cooking. Lobster should be thrown away if it's left at room temperature for more than 2 hours.
