  "text":" Boiling Bring a large pot of water to boil. Fill a large pot about 3/4 full of water and set it on the stove. Put the lid on the pot and turn the burner to high.

Since the cauliflower will float to the top of the water, ensure that whatever pot you use is large enough to comfortably hold as much cauliflower as you like. Then fill the pot 3/4 full of water. Cut the cauliflower into 1 in (2.5 cm) florets. While the water comes to a boil, rinse your fresh cauliflower. Take a sharp knife and cut evenly-sized florets. Cutting even pieces will ensure that the cauliflower blanches in a uniform way. Boil the cauliflower florets for 3 minutes. Carefully lift off the lid from the pot and add the cauliflower florets. Leave the lid off of the pot as the cauliflower cooks. Keep in mind that the cauliflower will not become completely soft. It should just become a little tender after it's boiled for 3 minutes. Drain the cauliflower through a strainer. Set a strainer or cauliflower in a sink. Turn off the burner and pour the cauliflower through the strainer so the hot water drains. Use caution when you lift the pot of hot water. Make an ice bath. Fill a large bowl with ice and pour in enough cold water to come about 3/4 of the way up the sides.
