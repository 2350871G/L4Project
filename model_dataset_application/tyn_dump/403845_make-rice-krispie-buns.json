Put 1 cup (150 grams) of milk chocolate into the bowl, along with 1/2 cup (100 grams) of butter. Turn the heat on medium-high, and stir the chocolate occasionally as it melts from the steam. If you\u2019re using the microwave, put the chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it in 15 second bursts, stirring it between each session until the chocolate is fully melted. A double boiler is also often called a bain marie. Use caution when working with hot objects.
