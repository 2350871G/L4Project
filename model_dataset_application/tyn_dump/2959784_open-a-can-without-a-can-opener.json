Using a Chef's Knife Position the can on a stable surface. A table as high as your hips is ideal. Do not place the can on your lap or in between your legs. The knife could slip and injure you. Hold the knife where the handle meets the blade. Grip the top of the knife with your palm directly over the joining place.

Position the heel of the knife against the inner edge of the lid. The heel of the knife is the place where the blade is widest. It's at the opposite end of the blade from the tip. Place it up against the raised lip at the edge of the can's lid. The heel should be centered right under the place where your palm is gripping the knife. Make sure it is firmly positioned against the edge of the lid, so it won't slip. Press the heel of the knife into the can. Press down firmly so that it punctures the can, creating a small hole.
