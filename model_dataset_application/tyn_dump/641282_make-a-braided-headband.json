  "text":" Making a 5-Strand Braided Headband Cut five, narrow strips from the bottom of a t-shirt. Cut off the bottom hem first, then cut the shirt into five, 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide horizontal bands. Cut the bands apart apart at one of the side seams to make five strips. Use a ruler and a fabric pen to make cutting lines, if you have to, but don't worry about making it perfect. For a wider headband, cut the strips 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide. For a thinner headband, cut the strips \u2153 inch (0.85 centimeters) wide. Stretch the fabric strips. Grab a fabric strip by both of the narrow ends. Give them a gentle tug, then move on to the next strip. Do this for all of the fabric strips. This will cause the strips to curl and become long tubes instead. Tape the strands to a table. Align the strands vertically and parallel to one other. You want to have two strands on the left, one strand in the middle, and two strands on the right. Place a long piece of tape across the top ends so that they don't slide off the table. Do a 5-strand braid. Cross the outer left strand over one strand, moving towards the right. Bring the middle strand over one towards the left. Cross the outer right strand over one strand, moving towards the left. Cross the middle strand over one to the right. Repeat these steps to complete the braid. Trim the headband to fit your head. Measure your head first, then add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). Cut your braid down to this new measurement. You need this extra length so that you can knot the ends together. Knot the ends of the strands together. Take the first strand at one end of the braid, and the first strand on the other end. Tie them together in a tight, double-knot. Repeat the process for the second, third, fourth, and fifth sets of strands. Trim off the ends from the knots. Alternatively, you can weave the ends back into the braid to hide them from view. For a cleaner finish, rotate the headband so that the knots are on the inside for the headband. Creating a Multi-Textured Headband Choose your fabric and ball chain. Patterned, cotton fabric with a floral print works well for a boho-chic look. For an edgier look, try a colored cording and leather instead. Ball chains come in both silver and gold, so pick the one that goes the best with your color scheme. You can find ball chains in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. You can also use an old ball chain necklace instead. Cut your fabric and ball chain. Cut two long strips out of your fabric/cording/leather that are \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wide and about 2\u00bd to 3 feet (0.91 m) (76.2 to 91.44 centimeters) long. Next, cut the ball chain down to 2\u00bd to 3 feet (0.91 m) long. You may not be able to cut your cording narrower; just focus on the length instead. Tape the three strands to a table. Set the ball chain down onto the table. Make sure that it is oriented vertically, then place the fabric strands to either side of it. Cover the ends with a piece of tape so that they don't move. For an edgier look, place the cord on one side of the ball chain, and the leather on the other. Braid the three strands together. Cross the left strand over the middle one, then cross the right strand over the middle one. Keep braiding until the strands are long enough to wrap around your head, minus 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). If the strands are too long, cut the excess off. Remember to use wire cutters for the ball chain. Glue the end of the braid to a hair tie. Thread the end of the braid through the hair tie by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Glue the end down to the rest of the braid with hot glue or fabric glue. The hair tie should be caught inside the looped fabric. You can also sew the braid instead. Remove the tape from the top of the braid, and glue it to the other end. Peel off the tape from the top of the braid. Thread it through the hair tie by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then glue it down, just as before. Don't let the braid twist, otherwise it won't be comfortable on your head.

Draw a line of glue along one of the narrow edges, then place it against the  end of the braid, just above the elastic. Wrap the ribbon around the base of the braid tightly, then glue down the other end. This will cover the end of the braid and give you a nicer finish. Repeat this step for the other side of the headband. A black ribbon will look the best, but if you can also match the ribbon color to the hair tie instead. Braiding Your Hair into a Headband Gather a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide section of hair from behind your ear. It does not matter which side of your ear you are grabbing the section on. You will be making another one just like it. This style works best on long hair that falls past the shoulders. If your hair is straight or fine, consider adding some texture with a texturizing mousse or spray. You can also use a curling iron. Braid the section upward. Split the section into three, equal strands. Hold the strands up towards the ceiling as you braid them. Secure the end of the braid with a clear hair elastic. Repeat the process on the other side of your head. You will now have two braids dangling down from behind your ears. Comb the rest of your hair back, away from your hairline.

Wrap the braids across the top of your head. Take the left braid, and wrap it over the top of your head, towards the right ear. Take the right braid, and wrap it over your head as well. This time, keep it just behind the first braid. Secure the braids behind your ears with bobby pins. They should look like a double-strand, braided headband.
