If you plan to use them in the next day or two but they\u2019re very underripe, place them in a paper bag with a fully ripened banana or apple. The gas released from these fruits will speed up the process. Don\u2019t put underripe tomatillos in the refrigerator or freezer because it will stop the ripening process and the tomatillo will taste overly tart and acidic."

If they\u2019re already ripe, you don\u2019t have to worry about them going bad in such a short period of time. Avoid placing extra-ripe tomatillos in a basket with other fruits that release ethylene gas (like bananas, apples, kiwi, or avocados) because it may overripen the tomatillo."

Don't place the bag next to bananas or apples because their natural gases will cause the tomatillos to go bad sooner than they otherwise would.
