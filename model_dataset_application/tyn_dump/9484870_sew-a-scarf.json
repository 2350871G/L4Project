          "description":"Having a bit of stretch to your infinity scarf can be nice if you decide to wrap it around your neck a few times, so you may want to go with a stretch jersey fabric. This will make it easier to get the scarf on and off. However, you can also go with a non-stretchy fabric if you choose, such as a cotton broadcloth or satin. Select a fabric that will allow you to create the type and color scarf that you want to wear."

          "description":"You can wrap the fabric around your neck to determine how long you want it to be, and doing this will also help you to decide how thick you would like you scarf. Mark the fabric where you want to cut it for the length, and then lay the fabric out flat and cut a straight line across the fabric to shorten the piece. If the fabric feels too bulky around your neck, then try cutting a few inches off of the long edge to thin it out. Then, try it on again. For a lightweight scarf, cut the fabric so that it is 24 inches (61 cm) wide and about 54 inches (140 cm) long."

If your fabric is not stretchy, then use the straight stitch setting on your sewing machine. Every sewing machine is a little different. Consult your sewing machine\u2019s manual for instructions on how to apply different settings to your machine."

Then, fold one of the long edges over so that it matches up with the other long edge. After you fold your fabric in half, the print sides should be matching up and no longer visible. You may pin the edges together to keep the fabric\u2019s edges even while you sew. Place a pin about every 4 inches (10 cm) to hold the fabric edges in place. This is especially helpful if you are working with a slippery fabric."

Then, lower the presser foot and start stitching at a slow speed by applying gentle pressure to your pedal. Sew about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the raw (cut) edges of the folded fabric. After you get a few stitches into the fabric, backstitch a few stitches. To backstitch, press the lever on the side of your machine. This will reverse the direction of your stitches.

    "Cut the excess thread after sewing each segment.",
    "Hem the edges of the fabric strip.",
    "Your fabric strip may have some raw or even frayed edges that will require a hem to keep them from unraveling further.",
    "Use your sewing machine to sew a zigzag stitch along the edges of your fabric strip after you have connected all of the pieces.",
    "Thread some ribbon through a yarn needle.",
    "Next, take the ribbon that you want to use to create the ruffled effect and thread it through the eye of a yarn needle.",
    "You will need a piece of ribbon that is about 3 yards (2.7 m) long and somewhat narrow (about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) wide).",
    "Make sure to choose a color of ribbon that will blend in with the color of your knit fabric.",
    "Anchor the end of the ribbon to the end of the fabric with a safety pin.",
    "To ensure that the knit fabric does not slide off of the ribbon completely, you can anchor it to something using a safety pin.",
    "Insert the pin through the end of the ribbon and then pin the end of the ribbon to the end of the fabric strip.",
    "Weave the needle through the center of the fabric strip.",
    "Insert the needle a few inches from the end of the strip.",
    "Then, insert the needle from the opposite side of the strip a few inches in from the end.",
    "Keep inserting the needle through the strip a few inches apart to create ruffles.",
    "Pull the fabric to create ruffles as you weave the ribbon through.",
    "After every few stitches, slide the fabric down on the ribbon to form the ruffles.",
    "Don\u2019t do too many stitches without sliding the fabric down.",
    "Sew the ends of the ribbon to secure them.",
    "To secure the ends of your scarf, sew through the ribbon to secure it to the fabric.",
    "Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch across the ribbon and fabric on each end of the scarf.",
    "This will keep the scarf ruffled on the ribbon.",
    "Another option is to tie the ends of the ribbon together to secure the scarf.",
    "This will turn the ruffle scarf into an infinity ruffle scarf."
