Luckily, this is easy to prevent \u2014 just pour off about a cup of milk so that you have a few inches of room at the top of the container. Doing this gives the milk plenty of room to expand. On the other hand, if you've already drunk more than a cup or two of your milk, you can usually skip this step."

          "description":"Once you freeze your milk, the expiration date on the jug becomes basically meaningless unless you thaw it again right away. For this reason, it's a wise idea to label your container with both today's date and the number of days remaining before it expires. You can write this directly on the container with a marker, or, if you prefer not to mark your container, you can use a piece of masking tape as a label. For example, if it's August 24th and the milk expires on August 29th, we might label the container with the text \"Frozen: Aug. 24 \u2014 five days to expire\" so that we'll know how long we have to drink the milk when we thaw it in a month or two."

When the milk is frozen, you may be able to see the separation of the milk and the fat. Don't worry \u2014 this is a normal part of the freezing process and is perfectly safe."

The general consensus seems to be that milk can last a very long time in the freezer but that it will gradually absorb the flavors and odors of other items in the freezer over time, becoming less appealing to drink. Note that richer dairy products, like eggnog, buttermilk, and cream generally have similar shelf lives to ordinary milk (or slightly shorter) when frozen \u2014 usually on the order of one to two months or so."

For this reason, the easiest way to thaw your milk is usually simply to transfer it from the freezer to the refrigerator. The slightly warmer temperatures of the refrigerator will allow the milk to thaw to a liquid state little by little.

Use a heavy object like a cast iron pot to hold the milk underwater as it thaws. This process will be quicker than thawing the milk in the refrigerator but will still usually take several hours, so be patient. The reason that water thaws milk more quickly than the refrigerator has to do with the way that energy is transferred between the milk and its surroundings at a molecular level. Liquids transfer heat energy into ice much more effectively than air, making them a much quicker method of thawing."

Listed below are just a few tips for avoiding this situation:\nDon't leave your frozen milk out at room temperature. Don't thaw your milk in the microwave. Don't thaw your milk in hot water.

Thus, most thawed milk is good for drinking and using in cooking projects for about a week after thawing. Though its appearance and consistency may be slightly different, it should still be safe to consume. Note that if your milk wasn't fresh when you froze it, it won't be fresh thawed, either.
