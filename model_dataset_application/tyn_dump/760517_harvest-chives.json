You want to leave about \u00bd an inch of green leaves attached to the bulb, above the soil. If you just need a few chives, harvest from the outside of the clump. Sharp scissors work best as they will not rip the plant like dull scissors will. Leave the rest to grow. If you want to continue to harvest them in winter, transfer a clump of chives to a pot. Place it on a sunny windowsill. You can then have fresh chives throughout the winter."
