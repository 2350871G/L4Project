Watercolor paints need to be activated with some water, but even acrylic paints could benefit from a few drops of water. This will make your acrylic paints more fluid and easier to work with. Work with a wet brush. Before you start painting, dip your brush into a cup of water, and blot it on a piece of paper towel. This will make it easier to paint with and reduce brushstrokes.

You can display your shell on a candle charger, dresser, or even the fireplace mantle. You can also hot glue it to a hairclip and turn it into a cute accessory. Trying Different Designs Turn your shells into painted critters. Paint your shell a solid color and let it dry.
