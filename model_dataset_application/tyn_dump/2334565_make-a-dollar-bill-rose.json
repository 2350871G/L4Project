Instead of folding directly in half, fold the bill in half but with each side coming up on an angle (so it looks like the letter \u201cV\u201d). You should be able to see the backside of the bill. Curl the bottom part of the bill edges inward using your fingertips. Use the same technique you used to create the curls for your bud.

Gently bend the wire so that it snugly holds the bud in the middle. You should end up with the bud being held in the middle and wire now basically folded in half. Twist the wire ends to join the two pieces as one (this forms the stem). Hold the flower by the bud and then twist and wind the wire downward. Fluff the bud by exaggerating the curls.

Approach wrapping the bills the same way you wrapped the bud by sliding the wire through the bill fold and bending the wire downward.

Hold the top of the flower and twist the wires in a downward until you reach the bottom/end. If you didn't use pipe cleaners, wind floral tape around the wires and cut the wire to an appropriate length using wire cutters (if necessary).
