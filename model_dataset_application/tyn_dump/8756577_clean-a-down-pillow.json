You can typically wash your cover with the rest of your clothes if it's made of cotton. If the cover is made of a delicate material like silk you'll want to run it through a separate, delicate wash. If the cover is made of silk, make sure to air dry the cover instead of putting it in your dryer or it may shrink or get damaged."

Use the highest possible spin speed to remove as much moisture as you can out of the pillow. If you have the option, adjust the settings so that there are two rinse cycles. Running the pillows through two rinse cycles will fully remove all the detergent from the pillows. Exposing your down pillow to hot water can cause it to shrink."

If you have a front load machine, pour a cup (236.58 ml) of laundry detergent into the detergent dispenser on the top of the machine.
