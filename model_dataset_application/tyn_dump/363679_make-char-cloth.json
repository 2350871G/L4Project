Using Char Cloth Gather firewood, kindling, and tinder. Char cloth won't burn hot enough to light a log all by itself. Just like any fire, you'll need tinder (dry grass, bark shavings, newspaper), kindling (twigs and small branches), and of course the logs themselves. Char cloth makes it easy to start this chain and light the tinder. Char cloth is most useful during damp weather, when tinder is more difficult to light. Build a Fire. Find a fire pit or a large dirt area cleared of all vegetation. Avoid areas with overhanging branches. Stack your kindling, then the wood on top of it, allowing plenty of room for oxygen.

You can light char cloth with a flint and steel or other portable sparking device (including a lighter that's run out of fluid). As soon as a spark lands on it and forms a glowing red patch, you're good to go. There are two common ways to aim the spark:\nHold the flint directly over the cloth, angled downward. Run the steel downward across the flint so sparks land on the cloth. Or hold the cloth against a sharp edge of the flint. Run the steel along this edge. Spread the flame. Blow on the glowing char cloth to get the heat to spread across it. Pick up the tinder bundle and gently push the sides up and over the cloth, until they start burning. Place the tinder under the kindling. As soon as the tinder starts burning, place it and the char cloth underneath the kindling. The fire should now spread to the kindling, then the wood.",
