          "description":"Set the shark meat in a refrigerator-safe dish and submerge it in milk. Allowing it to soak eliminates the smell of ammonia and gamey flavor that a lot of fresh catches have. If you buy the shark from a quality source, it may have already been treated. If you don\u2019t smell any ammonia, you may not need to soak the meat, although you can still do so to make sure the meat is at its best. Fresh-caught shark needs to be soaked right after it is cleaned, or else the meat can become inedible. It doesn\u2019t really matter what type of milk you use. Most people use any type of cow\u2019s milk or buttermilk, but alternatives like soy milk or even lemon juice do well in a pinch. Plain milk is less acidic than buttermilk and lemon juice, so it can be a good option if you aren't making a ceviche."

Most recipes don\u2019t call for shark skin, so you can remove it as well. If you\u2019re buying shark from a store, chances are someone took care of this ahead of time, so you don\u2019t need to worry about it. You can remove the skin after you cook the meat. Leaving the skin on may help the meat retain more moisture."

          "description":"Slice the shark horizontally with a sharp knife to divide it up into smaller pieces. Avoid cutting the shark too thick or too thin. Shark meat is lean, so it can easily dry out when you cook it. Marinating the shark after you slice it can help prevent it from drying out. Although steaks are a common way to cook and eat shark, you can also chop the steaks up into smaller pieces, such as when making kebabs or a ceviche."

For a simple but flavorful marinade, try combining \u20442  c (120 mL) of orange juice with 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of soy sauce and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of lemon juice. Stir in 1 clove of minced garlic, \u00bc teaspoon (0.57 g) of pepper, and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil. Choose a bowl big enough to hold the shark. You can also pour the marinade into resealable bags with the shark. Some other seasoning options include paprika, ginger, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and rice wine vinegar. For simpler steaks, rub them with olive oil, then sprinkle on salt and pepper. You can skip the marinade and throw them onto the grill right away. Try serving the shark with a sauce, such as a mango salsa."

For the best results, turn the shark pieces in the marinade after 15 minutes. Expect to need the whole 30 minutes for the marinade to seep into the meat. You can leave the shark in the marinade for 1 or 2 hours to give it more flavor."

To test the grill, hold your hand about 4 in (10 cm) over the grate. At the correct temperature, you will be able to hold your hand there for only 3 to 4 seconds.

    "Lemons help neutralize the unpleasant flavor and prepare the meat for searing.",
    "Heat olive oil and butter in a pan over medium-high heat.",
    "Pour about 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of olive oil in the pan, then add 2 tablespoons (28.4 g) of butter.",
    "Allow the butter to melt.",
    "Continue heating the pan until the oil shimmers and slides easily around the pan.",
    "Baking the shark in the oven is also possible.",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C), then cook the shark between 10 to 12 minutes.",
    "To fry the shark, coat it in flour, then cook it in vegetable oil or shortening.",
    "Season the meat with salt, pepper, and spices.",
    "Lay the shark pieces out on a flat surface, then rub a spice mix over each side.",
    "A Cajun spice mix is an example of the flavors you can aim for.",
    "Add about 1 tablespoon (8.0 g) of the mix to each side of the meat.",
    "Also add 2 chopped up cloves of garlic.",
    "To make a Cajun spice mix at home, combine salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes.",
    "Cook the steaks about 6 minutes per side.",
    "Fit the shark pieces into the pan and wait for them to turn white and then a little brown on the bottom.",
    "Turn the pieces over with a spatula.",
    "When they are done cooking, they will look white and flakey.",
    "Set them aside on a plate when they\u2019re done.",
    "Test the shark with a knife or fork.",
    "In particular, pay attention to the center of each piece.",
    "Make sure it is cooked all the way through.",
    "The cooking time may vary depending on your oven and the heat setting you chose.",
    "Cook white wine or broth in the pan for 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "Pour about \u20444  c (59 mL) of either liquid into the pan.",
    "Stir the liquid in the pan to mix in any of the juice and meat left over from the shark.",
    "Continue cooking the liquid until it thickens into a nice sauce you can pour over the shark steaks.",
    "Another option is to melt 1 tablespoon (14.2 g) of butter with 1  c (240 mL) of spiced rum and the juice from 1 lime.",
    "If the shark hasn\u2019t finished cooking yet, you can add the liquids while it is still in the pan.",
    "Store the leftovers for up to 4 days in the refrigerator.",
    "After serving the shark, move the leftovers into resealable plastic bags or containers.",
    "Label the containers as needed.",
    "Throw away any remaining pieces once they look rancid or begin emitting a sour odor.",
    "You can store pan-fried shark for up to 3 months in the freezer.",
    "Making Shark Ceviche Cut the shark into \u20442 in (1.3 cm) chunks.",
    "Clean and slice the shark into steaks about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick first.",
    "Then, use your knife to break the steaks down into smaller pieces.",
    "Make them into cubes about the same general size.",
    "The pieces don\u2019t have to be exactly the same size, but keep them small and thin so they cure properly.",
    "Toss the shark cubes with citrus juice and other seasonings.",
    "Add the shark pieces to a glass or ceramic casserole dish.",
    "For a basic ceviche, try using \u20442  c (120 mL) of both lime and lemon juice.",
    "Also add \u00bd a cup (75 g) of diced red onions and 1 cup (200 g) of chopped tomatoes.",
    "For seasonings, mix in 1 chopped serrano chili, 2 teaspoons (11.38 g) of salt, 1 teaspoon (1.0 g) of oregano, and 1 teaspoon (1.80 g) of cayenne pepper.",
    "You can add or leave out additional ingredients.",
    "For instance, add cilantro for flavoring or leave out the cayenne pepper if you don\u2019t like spicy food.",
    "In a ceviche, the acid in the citrus juices breaks down and cures shark meat similar to the way heat does without cooking it.",
    "Avoid making ceviche if you aren\u2019t comfortable eating raw meat.",
    "Cover the dish in plastic wrap and refrigerate it.",
    "Seal the dish tightly to lock in the flavor.",
    "Using plastic wrap allows you to get a quick glimpse of how the shark is progressing as it cures.",
    "You can also use aluminum foil, since you will need to stir the ingredients every so often.",
    "Make sure the juices cover all of the meat before you store the dish.",
    "Marinate the fish for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally.",
    "Every hour, peel back the plastic wrap and stir the contents of the dish to ensure all of the fish is exposed to the juices.",
    "The shark will turn white and flaky over time.",
    "When this happens, you can take the dish out of the refrigerator.",
    "When the shark turns white, it is done.",
    "You don\u2019t have to wait the full 4 hours.",
    "Serve the shark with tortillas and other toppings.",
    "You can warm up some tortillas to make ceviche tacos.",
    "Some other options include chopped cilantro and fresh avocado.",
    "Also, season the shark with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Refrigerate the leftovers for about 1 day.",
    "Remove the shark pieces from the dish, storing them separately.",
    "Rinse off the shark pieces to stop them from continuing to marinate.",
    "Then, move the leftovers into resealable plastic bags or containers as soon as possible.",
    "Ceviche made from fresh fish may last as long as 3 days, but throw the ceviche away if it starts smelling rancid or looks slimy.",
    "Unfortunately freezing a ceviche doesn\u2019t work too well.",
    "The shark tends to lose its texture, although it will still be edible."
