Lightly mist any areas that may require a little extra work to clean. The spray will begin softening dirt and other grime while you prepare the dry cleaning powder. Use a spray on stains and areas that receive heavy traffic. If your carpet doesn\u2019t have any tough stains, you can skip the pretreatment.

Keep sprinkling the powder to lightly dust the area you wish to clean. If you\u2019re doing the whole room at once, spread the powder from one side of the room to the other. It will be safe to step on, but make sure heavily soiled spots stay covered. You can\u2019t really use too much of the powder, so spread it around. As long as some of it gets on a spot, it will be effective, but remember that deep stains require more powder to clear. If you don\u2019t have a kitchen sifter, you could use a cup or a measuring spoon instead. When you\u2019re done, wash out your tools in case you use them for anything other than cleaning. Purchase carpet cleaning powders online or check your local general store for them. You could also buy a dry cleaning kit, which contains a pretreatment stray, sifter, and brush as well."

Scrubbing the carpet could wear out its threads over time, and you don\u2019t have to use that much pressure to work the powder in. If you are able to, use a nylon carpet brush that can be fitted with a threaded handle. That way, you don\u2019t have to bend down while scrubbing.

For safety, avoid getting any powder on your skin. Keep children and pets out of the room so they don\u2019t inadvertently swallow any of it.

Make sure you cover any spots sprayed with the encapsulant to agitate hidden dirt, bringing it up to the surface so it can be vacuumed up with ease. If you don\u2019t have a broom, you could use a soft-bristled scrub brush instead. However, most brushes are smaller and better for treating specific spots rather than the entire carpet.

    "Scrub gently to avoid wearing out the carpet threads.",
    "Make sure the paste spreads between the threads so it is able to reach the part of the stain below the surface.",
    "Make sure the stain is well-covered with the cleaner, or else it may not be effective.",
    "Let the paste air dry overnight on the carpeting.",
    "The paste will dry out at a relatively rapid rate.",
    "Leave it exposed to open air, but make sure no one disturbs it until it has finished drying.",
    "When it becomes solid, like sand or dust, it is ready to be cleaned up.",
    "The mixture dries out at a relatively quick rate, so you could vacuum it up even earlier.",
    "However, make sure it has finished drying out.",
    "Vacuum up the dried paste to finish cleaning the carpet.",
    "Use a strong, carpet-safe vacuum to pull up all of the remaining paste.",
    "It is also safe to scoop up by hand, such as with a paper towel, but you won\u2019t be able to get all of it.",
    "Finish cleaning up by vacuuming treated stains several times to pull up any remaining debris you may have missed.",
    "Sometimes stains require multiple treatments.",
    "If that still isn\u2019t enough, try using a commercial dry cleaning product or encapsulant."
