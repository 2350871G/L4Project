Letting the milk dry into the fibers of your clothing makes it harder to remove the stains later. Soak a cotton rag or sponge with cold water and blot the stain in the area where you spilled the milk. Rubbing and scraping the milk stain may make the stain worse."

Soaking a milk stain will help loosen up the fabric and will prevent discoloration when you wash your item. If the milk has hardened onto your clothing, you can use a flat edged tool to scrape it off. Using warm or hot water can make the stain worse, so avoid doing this. For really bad stains, soaking your clothing overnight could help remove the stain."
