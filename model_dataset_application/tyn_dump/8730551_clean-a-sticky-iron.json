  "text":" Wiping the Iron with a Soap Solution Rub your iron with a rag dampened with water first, if desired. If the stickiness on your iron is minimal, opt for this gentle method first. Heat your iron slightly on a low setting. Wet a rag with water so that it\u2019s damp, not dripping. Unplug the iron before scrubbing it with the rag. Bunch up the damp rag a bit and make sure not to touch the iron directly with your hand. Mix a soap and water solution. If plain water doesn\u2019t do the trick, allow your unplugged iron to cool until it\u2019s at room temperature. Put a squirt of liquid dish soap in the bottom of a bowl. Fill the bowl with warm water. Rub off the buildup. Dip a sponge or rag into the soap solution. Squeeze out any excess water so that the sponge or rag is damp, not dripping. Scrub the soleplate of the cool, dry iron. Use a dry rag to wipe away the moisture. For stubborn gunk, try using a nylon mesh pad. Using Baby Powder Start with a cool iron. Unplug the iron from any power source. Let the iron cool until it is room temperature. Rub baby powder onto the soleplate. Sprinkle some baby powder on a dishrag. Wipe the baby powder onto the iron with the dishrag. Use the hot iron on 2 dishrags. Heat up your iron. Wipe the excess baby powder off by ironing the first dishrag. Then, repeat this on a second dishrag to ensure that all of the sticky residue is off of the iron. Iron your garment. If the fabric is delicate, iron a small test area first on the inside of the garment. Ironing over 2 dishrags should ensure that no more sticky residue is left behind from the iron, but double check to be sure. Ironing Paper Heat your iron. Turn your iron on the highest setting. Make sure the steam is turned off. Run the iron over paper. Lay down a sheet of newspaper or paper towels. Slide the hot iron across the paper until it\u2019s free of residue. This works particularly well for waxy substances stuck to your iron. Add salt, if needed. If your iron still has sticky buildup, pour a tablespoon of salt onto the paper. Run the iron over the salted paper to remove the residue. Alternately, you can sprinkle the salt on a dry cotton towel. This option will remove stickiness if you need to iron a garment in a hurry. However, it won\u2019t remove all staining from your iron. Using Vinegar and Salt Heat vinegar and salt in a saucepan. Use equal parts salt and white vinegar. Set the burner to medium-high. Let the solution heat until bubbles start slowly rising, before the mixture comes to a boil. Crack a window if the smell of vinegar bothers you. Keep your iron turned off and unplugged. Scrub the soleplate with the solution. Wear gloves to protect your hands. Wet a clean cloth or non-metal scouring pad in the solution by dipping the end into the pot.
