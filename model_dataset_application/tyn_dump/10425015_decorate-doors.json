Matte, gloss, and vinyl are the most reasonably priced, while marble and granite paper seem to run on the expensive side. If you are looking for a more sophisticated look, try using black and white floral prints. For fun and edgy looks, use translucent paper or animal prints. Choose red paper as a decoration for the holidays or floral patterns to represent different seasons.

Many self-adhesive papers have grids on the back of them. If your paper does, try to stay as close to the grid lines as possible to create a straight cut."

You can either use your hands or the side of a credit card to smooth it out. No matter which one you choose, apply light pressure as you move the card over the paper from top to bottom and push the bubbles to the edges. If the air bubbles will not come out, or you are unhappy with the placement of your paper, you can peel it off and replace it.

You can also create your own twig wreath by gathering twigs and hot gluing about 6 of them together at a time. Secure each end of the bundles to each other with twine. Making your own wreath will also allow you to customize the size and design.

Arrange your faux flowers the way you'd like on top of the wreath and hot glue them into place. Depending on the thickness of your wreath, you may need to trim the stems of the flowers. Let the glue dry for 5-10 minutes before you hang the wreath. Always be careful when handling a hot-glue gun. Use cherry blossoms or zinnias for spring wreaths, while hydrangeas and lilacs are great for summer wreaths. Irises or lilies bring out fall colors. Try pansies or chrysanthemums for winter baskets. You can mix and match flowers to create a festive door decoration. Another option is to weave some greenery or another subtle fiber through the wreath, such as ivy, moss, or cotton."

For instance, you can hot glue on a Santa hat or toy reindeer to create a Christmas wreath. You can also hot glue on a black cat and a witch's hat for Halloween.

To line your basket, use your sheet moss to surround the interior sides. You do not need to glue the sheet moss in place. This will help prevent any of the faux flowers from falling out after they are assembled. It also has a great natural look that will make your flower basket seem as though it is filled with fresh flowers. If you are using a wicker basket or another basket that does not have openings in the sides, you do not have to add the sheet moss."

If your floral stems are too short to cut off, you can add in a few more flowers to fill the arrangement. Don't worry if you accidentally cut a stem too short. You can always use a dab of hot glue to attach it. Just be careful not to overdo it as too much hot glue will melt the foam."

Pussy willow flowers are beautiful in spring baskets. Sunflowers are great when brightening up summer baskets. For fall baskets, use chrysanthemums or pansies. Use snowdrops or red chokeberries for winter baskets."

If your branches or flowers are too tall, you can cut them to your desired size. Arrange the flowers so that the basket looks full. Dogwood branches are recommended for spring and summer baskets. Flowers such as dianthus and violas work well for fall and winter baskets."

You should arrange them so the basket looks full by spreading them evenly across the front. Branches from the forsythia bush look great in spring and summer. Purple fountain grass and flowering kale work well in fall baskets. Jasmine is great to use in winter baskets. For an extra wintery look, try adding some fake snow around the flowers."

To hang the basket, place the hook over the door and place the hook through one of the openings in the side or the basket.
