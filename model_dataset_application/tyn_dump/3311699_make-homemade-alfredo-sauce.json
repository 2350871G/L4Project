  "text":" Collecting the Ingredients Measure 2 tbs. (29.57 ml) of butter. You can use either salted or unsalted butter, depending on your preferred taste. Do not use margarine or butter substitute. Real butter is essential to Alfredo sauce. Pour 1 cup (8 oz.) of heavy whipping cream into a bowl or measuring cup. Grate 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. You may want to grate a little bit more to sprinkle over your pasta or whatever dish you are using with the Alfredo sauce. Try to use fresh parmesan cheese. While it is convenient to buy it already grated and packaged, the taste will improve when you buy a block of cheese and grate it freshly yourself. Have salt and pepper on hand. The amount you add to the sauce or the finished dish will depend on your personal taste. Making the Sauce Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Make sure you do not burn the butter or let it brown. Alfredo sauce is white, so keep an eye on the butter as it melts. Pour the cream slowly into the saucepan, stirring it into the butter with a wooden spoon as you pour.  Add some salt and pepper to the mixture to season it as it combines and cooks.  Bring the mixture to a boil. Once it begins to boil, reduce the heat and allow it to simmer. Stir the sauce with a wooden spoon while it thickens and simmers for 5 minutes.  Take the saucepan off the heat. This is an important step before you add the cheese, because if you do so while the pan is still receiving heat from the stove, the cheese will clump or get stringy. Add the parmesan cheese to the mixture and continue to stir it with the spoon. Incorporate it completely into the sauce. Taste the Alfredo sauce in the pan and add a little more salt or pepper if you prefer.  Serving the Alfredo Sauce Toss the warm sauce with pasta. The most popular dish involving this is Fettuccine Alfredo. You can use any type of pasta you like, however. Use the sauce to cover a pizza crust and create a white pizza. You can add any toppings you want. Coat chicken, shrimp or meatballs with the Alfredo sauce. These can be added to pasta or served on their own, even as bite-sized appetizers.
