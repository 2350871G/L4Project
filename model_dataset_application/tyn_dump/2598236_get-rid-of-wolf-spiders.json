By exposing as much of your yard as possible to sunlight, you make the area relatively unappealing to wolf spiders. Clear away as much debris and clutter from your yard as possible.

Wolf spiders love to hide in dark places, and low vegetation is among the wolf spider's favorite hiding spots. If possible, remove all heavy ground-covering plants from the yard.

Keep your lights turned off as much as possible to limit the number of insects drawn to your home. Draw your blinds or shades closed to keep indoor lighting from flooding out. Switch to sodium vapor lights instead of standard outdoor lights. These lights have a soft yellow hue which is less likely to attract bugs. This is an especially effective control method against wolf spiders. Wolf spiders hunt at night, so the less food available to the at night, the less likely they are to hang around."

Chemicals designed to kill spiders immediately will only exterminate spiders already in the home. These measures should be used in conjunction with measures designed to prevent wolf spiders from sneaking in for maximum effectiveness. Residual chemicals provide more long-term effectiveness and may be more helpful if you have difficulty preventing spiders from getting into the building. Residual pesticides sprinkled on the ground work better against wolf spiders than many other spider varieties. Many spiders travel along webs and walls, and as a result, they rarely cross over barriers made with residual pesticides. Wolf spiders hunt on the ground, however, so they are more likely to step into a residual pesticide."

These traps consist of little more than heavy cardboard with extremely sticky glue pasted on them. Wolf spiders and other pests get stuck on the glue as they step onto the trap. They become unable to move and die of starvation. Place glue traps in the corners of basements and garages. The traps should also be placed beneath and behind furniture, as well as on both sides of any door that leads to the outside. Keep these traps out of reach of small children and pets.

You can also track the spiders down outside by shining a flashlight into overgrowth, patches of woods, and dense shrubs. Wolf spiders have discs located in the back of their eyes.

Release the spider outside as soon as possible. Make sure that you release it far away from the perimeter of your home so that it does not crawl back inside as soon as it is free. Use a glove when trapping and picking up wolf spiders to reduce the risk of being bitten. While wolf spider venom is not usually toxic to humans, getting bitten can still sting considerably.
