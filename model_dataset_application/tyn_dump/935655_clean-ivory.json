Be sure to use a soft, clean paintbrush, and to work in one direction so that you don\u2019t spread dirt or impurities around the surface of the object. Before handling ivory, wear clean, white cloth gloves. Without gloves, the oil from your fingers can transfer to the ivory and affect its coloring. Brushing ivory works especially well if you are trying to remove a small amount of dirt or impurities. Work the bristles of the paintbrush into any crevices on the object to remove dirt"

Use a zester or grater to grate down the eraser into small shavings. Make sure that the vinyl eraser is white. An eraser of any other color could contaminate and discolor the ivory."
