The alcohol and the caffeine should produce a unique stimulating effect that many people quite enjoy. That said: it is dangerous to consume excessive amounts of caffeine and alcohol \u2013 especially when you are combining the two. The caffeine rush can mask the depressant effects of alcohol, making it seem like a great idea to drink more than you can safely handle. If you are a teenager, try to limit yourself to 100mg of caffeine per day. Avoid drinking more than one or two Jager Bombs in a night. Know the signs of caffeine overdose. Mild symptoms include jitters, restlessness, nervousness, rapid heart rate, nausea, and anxiety. You may experience heart palpitations, insomnia, and sweating. Severe overdose can result in dizziness, vomiting, and even cardiac arrest."
