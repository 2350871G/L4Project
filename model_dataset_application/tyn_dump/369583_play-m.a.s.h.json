Number of kids you're going to have: This goes on the bottom of your paper, you'll want to put down the numbers \"1, 2, 3, 4\". The car you'll have: This will go on the left side of your paper.

There are many ways to choose your number -- you can close your eyes and dot the paper until someone tells you to stop and then count how many dots you have, or you can close your eyes while making a spiral and count how many times you went around.
