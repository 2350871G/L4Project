Herbs should dry away from direct sunlight and moisture or they will spoil. Drying times will take anywhere from 5 days to a few weeks, depending on the types of herbs you're drying. Remove when dried. The herbs are dried when they just become crisp and no moisture can be felt. Use for culinary, medicinal, display or craft purposes. Many dried herbs will crumble readily, making them easy to turn into herb mixes such as bouquet garni. Dried herbs are often great additions to potpourri too. Drying in the Oven Set the oven to a very low temperature, the lowest it will go. Leave the door open. Arrange the picked herbs across a baking sheet.  Place the sheet in the lowest level of the oven. Let dry but turn the herbs frequently. When they appear a little crisp, remove from the oven. For those with a wood oven, screen racks can be placed on top of the wood stove. Lay the herbs across it to dry in their own time. Drying by microwaving Sprinkle a thin layer of silica gel on the base of a microwave-safe container.  Add the herb leaves or flowers to this layer. Spread evenly and avoid touching leaves or flowers between each herb piece. Microwave the herbs. Use a lower power setting, such as the half power or defrost power settings. Dry for 2 minutes, then let sit for 10 minutes. Check for the level of dryness. If it is sufficient, then use the herbs as required. If not, do another dry for about 1 minute. If the drying of 2 minutes proves too long and the herbs have dried out too much, use a new set of herbs and reduce the drying time by 30 seconds. Keep experimenting to reach the right timing, depending on the type of herb. Herbs that tend to air dry well with little shrinkage (such as thyme) will need less time in the microwave than herbs that don't air dry as well (such as basil). Use for craft and display projects only. As already noted, the silica use means that the herbs are no longer safe for consuming. Drying using desiccants Choose a desiccant. A desiccant is a substance that draws moisture out. Suitable desiccants for herbs include cornmeal, sand, orris root, borax, silica gel and even kitty litter. Silica gel is popular because it is light and won't crush the herbs; it is easily obtainable from craft stores. However, when working with it, wear a mask to avoid breathing in its fumes. Pick the herbs. Pick when moisture won't affect the herbs or their flowers. Sprinkle 2.5cm/ 1/2 inch of desiccant across the base of a glass or plastic container. Glass and plastic won't create moisture. Place the herbs onto the desiccant. Keep any flowers separate from one another (not touching). Leaves and petals that are close together will require pulling apart to ensure the desiccant goes in between gaps and dries out every part of the herb. If the shape of the petals or leaves is important, check for any that get bent out of shape and realign them as you're rearranging the desiccant. You can layer desiccant and herbs if wished; just be aware that the more weight on top, the more the plant matter beneath risks being crushed. Remove from the desiccant as soon as they have dried. This will only take a few days. Desiccant will leave herb leaves and flowers bone-dry and therefore somewhat brittle. To remove desiccant, use a small brush or a camera cleaning bellows to shift desiccant off the plant matter without damaging the plant. Handle with care. Avoid over drying the herbs or they may simply fall apart when handled. Use for craft and display projects only. The herbs are not suitable for consumption. Drying in Place Choose an appropriate herb for drying in place. Not all herbs will dry well in this manner but some leaves and flowers will dry this way, such as yarrow, fennel and rosemary. Use the fresh herb to add to the position where you want it to dry. For example, in a vase/bouquet with other plants being arranged or add to a craft project such as a wreath or a woven plant object. Place in a dry area without moisture. Allow to dry as is, but do check on it regularly. If you see signs of mildew or anything else that doesn't look right, remove the herbs. Drying by pressing For information on pressing plant material, see further How to press leaves. Pressed herbs can be used to decorate craft projects such as scrapbooks, framed prints, bookmarks and collages. Finished. ",
