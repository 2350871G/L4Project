For example, a rectangular 6-seater dining room table should be 6 ft (180 cm) long, while a round 6-seater table only needs to be about 5 ft (150 cm) long.

    "If you\u2019re on a budget, look for seats made with a cotton blend or an ultrasuede material, as these are especially easy to clean off after a meal.",
    "Leather is another luxurious upholstery option you can consider for your chair, though it will be a more costly investment.",
    "If you want more flexibility in how you wash and clean your seats, you might want to consider removable cushions or upholstery.",
    "When measuring an upholstered seat, be sure to measure up to the height of the cushion, and not just the wooden seat.",
    "Select a Parson\u2019s chair if you\u2019d like firmer back support.",
    "If you don\u2019t like the wooden spindles of a traditional side chair, you might prefer a seat that completely surrounds your back.",
    "While these seats don\u2019t have any armrests, you can often find them with built-in cushioning and upholstery.",
    "Although these chairs aren\u2019t incredibly fancy, they can help make your dining room look a bit more posh.",

    "Benches might be an appealing option if you plan on hosting a lot of children.",
    "Opt for a wood or wicker frame if you\u2019d like your chairs to be traditional and rustic.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a particular preference for your chair\u2019s material, you may like the versatility that wooden chairs offer to a room.",
    "You can choose between a variety of chair designs, ranging from spindles to moldings to a cross-back.",
    "If you don\u2019t want a plain wooden chair, you can always look for seats that come with upholstery.",
    "If you\u2019d prefer for your chairs to have a laid-back, beachy vibe, then wicker might be another great chair material to consider.",
    "Choose metal if you\u2019d prefer a sturdy and reflective seat.",

    "If you have a chair set that you\u2019d like to invest in, first compare it to a picture of your dining room.",
    "While the seat doesn\u2019t have to be an exact match, make sure that the chair\u2019s frame matches the color of the table.",
    "If the chair doesn\u2019t mesh well with the dining room table, then you may need to select a different chair for your room.",
    "For instance, don\u2019t pick tan dining room chairs to accompany a light brown table.",
    "Shades of white go well with many dining room tables.",
    "Choose seats that complement the vibe of your dining room.",

    "If the chairs don\u2019t match the decor and energy of the room, then you might want to expand your search.",
