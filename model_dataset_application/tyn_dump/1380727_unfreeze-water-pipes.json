          "description":"Turn on all the faucets in your house to see which ones are working. If water is running through one faucet but not another, the problem is located along the pipes running between the two. Leave all faucets open slightly. A small trickle of running water from working faucets can prevent further freezing and help melt the ice. Leave blocked faucets open as well to reduce pressure on the pipes. Most American houses have faucets on external walls too, especially on the front and back of the house."

Pipes near cold air vents or cold concrete. Outdoor valves and spigots. Outdoor pipes can freeze, but check these last, as most systems are designed to keep standing water out of these pipes."

To look at the backs of pipes near walls, and in other difficult to reach areas, use a flashlight and a large dental mirror from a hardware store.
