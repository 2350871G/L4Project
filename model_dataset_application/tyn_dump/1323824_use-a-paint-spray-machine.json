      "description":"Hold the sprayer so the paint will exit horizontally and maintain a consistent distance of 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) from the surface. Keep your wrist stiff and move the sprayer in sweeping motions with your arm. To paint horizontal surfaces, such as ceilings, use a tip extension to redirect the paint. Spray from left to right (or right to left if you're left-handed), pressing the trigger on the sprayer just before you arrive at the point where you want to lay down paint. Lay down about 3 feet (1 meter) of paint at a time. Overlap the next application over your first by 50 percent so the surface will get 2 thin coats and won't dry into stripes of paint."
