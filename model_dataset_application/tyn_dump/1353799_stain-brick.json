If the water is not absorbed, try again with a commercial brick or concrete sealer stripper. If the commercial stripper does not work, staining is not possible. Paint over the brick instead."

Rinse thoroughly from the top down, then let dry completely. Heavily discolored bricks may require chemical brick cleaners, but these can damage the brick or mortar, or interfere with the stain. Look for gentle options, and avoid unbuffered muriatic acid in particular. If you are treating a large surface, hire a trained operator to pressure wash the surface. Unskilled pressure washing can permanently scar bricks. Make sure you mix a cleaner into the water before pressure washing."

When in doubt, add less stain to the water. It's easy to add more concentrated color later, but difficult to lighten a stain once it's been applied.
