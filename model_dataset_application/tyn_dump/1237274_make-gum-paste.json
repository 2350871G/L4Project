Fit the mixer with a paddle attachment, then beat the eggs on high speed for about 10 seconds, just long enough to break them apart. The paddle mixer will break up the eggs evenly, without whipping them too much. Since egg yolks are high in fat, if any of the yolks get into your egg whites, it could keep the mixture from reaching soft-peak stage later on."

          "description":"If you add the sugar all at once, the egg whites could deflate, and the mixture won\u2019t reach soft-peak stage, which is necessary for the gum paste to become elastic. Instead, add the powdered sugar slowly, about 1 cup (125 g) at a time. Wait until each addition is fully mixed in before you add in more. Sift your sugar and make sure the measuring cup is level when you measure it out. This will ensure you get a consistent result every time. You\u2019ll incorporate the remaining 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar later on."

It will also appear shiny and white. This is called the soft peak stage, and it should take about 5 minutes. The egg and sugar mixture should have the consistency of royal icing or soft-serve ice cream.Tip: Try adding 2-3 drops of food coloring to the eggs and sugar if you want it all to be the same color!"

If your mixer starts to bog down before the tylose is fully integrated, turn the speed to high. When it\u2019s ready, you should have a mixture that\u2019s gummy and stiff, but still creamy. The texture will be similar to a stiff buttercream. Tylose may also be called gum tragacanth or gum -tex."

In addition to keeping the dough from sticking to your hands, the shortening will help keep the gum paste from cracking as it dries. How much you use is up to you, but about 1/2 tbsp (6 g) of shortening should be plenty."

Put the dough in a plastic bag and squeeze out all of the air, then place the bag in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight. Let the gum paste sit on your counter for about 30 minutes to bring it up to room temperature before you use it. If you have any leftover gum paste, keep it in the fridge in an airtight container.
