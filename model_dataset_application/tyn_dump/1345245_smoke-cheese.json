For fully smoked cheese, use pieces no larger than 4\" x 4\" by 2\" (10cm x 10cm x 5cm), so the smoke can penetrate through the entire piece of cheese.

There's some disagreement among cheese-smokers over this step. Some people prefer to keep the cheese chilled or even frozen before smoking.

However, once the cold smoker is set up, smoking is simple and risk of melting the cheese is low. Some cold smoker attachments are small, low-heat devices with special wood dust fuel. These can be placed at the bottom of the hot smoker, and used as directed. Other cold smoker attachments are additional compartments that attach to your hot smoker. If not created by the same company, you may need to attach the two together yourself. Some models only require a drill, nut, and bolt to achieve this, but find out before you buy. Either way, once you set the cold smoker up, cook the cheese over wood chips or wood pellets for 1\u20136 hours, turning at least once, then remove and refrigerate for 1\u20134 weeks before eating.
