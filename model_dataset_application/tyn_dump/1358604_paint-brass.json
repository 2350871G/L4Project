Other objects, like furniture, utensils, and lamps, are already portable. If you removed any screws, nails, or other hardware, store them in a safe place so you can return the item after it\u2019s painted. It\u2019s also a good idea to test that your item is in fact brass. To test if something is brass, hold a magnet to it. Brass is a non-ferrous metal, meaning it contains no iron. As such, brass is also not magnetic, so a magnet will not be attracted to a brass object."

This will protect you from paint fumes in addition to wearing a mask. Place a drop cloth on the ground to protect the surrounding area from paint and splatter.

Not only does this help remove dirt and corrosion, but it also provides the paint with a good surface to stick to. Rub the entire surface with the steel wool, concentrating on areas that are especially corroded or heavily soiled. When you finished scrubbing the item, wipe it down with a damp, lint-free cloth. Paint needs a rough surface to stick to, which is why you want to scrub it with steel wool. Scrubbing brass with steel wool is not advisable unless you're preparing it for painting."

Spray in a sweeping motion, going from side to side, and apply a thin, even coat of primer onto the surface.
