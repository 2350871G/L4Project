      "description":"Put a large pot of water on the stove to boil and add 1/2 tbsp. (8 ml) of salt to the pot. You'll need about 6 quarts (5.5 L) of water to cook 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of angel hair pasta. Once the water has come to a boil add the angel hair pasta and stir. Begin timing the angel hair pasta once the water boils, and turn the heat down so the water simmers. You want to cook the pasta in simmering water for about 3 minutes or slightly longer if you like a softer pasta. Drain the pasta and either chill it under cold running water or toss it with a sauce and serve it immediately."
