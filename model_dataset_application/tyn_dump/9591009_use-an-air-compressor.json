  "text":" Setting up the Compressor Check the pump oil level if your compressor isn\u2019t oil-free. Old compressors, as well as large ones, tend to be oil-filled. Locate the dipstick near the bottom of one of the compressor\u2019s ends. Pull it out and check to see that the oil level reaches about \u2154 of the way up the stick. If it doesn\u2019t, pour some compressor oil into the tank. If you need oil, it can be found at most home improvement, hardware, and auto parts stores. If you\u2019re unsure about what kind of compressor you have, consult the owner\u2019s manual. Most small compressors are now oil-free, so that\u2019s why you may not see an oil tank or dipstick. Attach the hose to the regulator valve. Set the compressor on flat ground. Find the regulator valve, which should be right next to the smaller pressure gauge on 1 end of the compressor. It\u2019s a round, copper-colored, metal plug with a big hole in the middle. Push the pointed end of the hose into the valve to attach it. Plug your power tool into the hose. Hold the hose in 1 hand and the power tool in the other. Slide the tool\u2019s plug into the hose\u2019s free end and twist them together until the tool locks in place.
