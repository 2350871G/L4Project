You can use green floral tape to look like a natural stem, or use a bright colour to match with the suit or tie. Assembling the Boutonniere Twist two wire succulent stems together. Once you have created an individual stem for each succulent, you need to join them all together. Twist two of the wire stems together to help secure them in place. You can also slightly bend the wire to position the succulents so that they are facing in right direction. Wrap the stems together with floral tape. Using floral tape, wrap all of the stems together.

You can wrap the ribbon or twine around the stem of the boutonniere and then attach it with hot glue, or you can tie a small bow with the ribbon to secure it to the stem. Consider a pig tail finish.
