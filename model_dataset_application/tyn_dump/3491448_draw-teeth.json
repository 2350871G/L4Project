However, understanding the general shape of teeth and gums will tremendously help you in drawing realistic teeth. For sake of simplicity, this article will focus on drawing teeth from a face-to-face perspective. It is important to note that every smile varies in the number of upper and lower teeth that show. Take note of any abnormalities in the teeth structure, such as missing or crooked teeth. Although it seems intuitive, it is important to draw what you see, not what you imagine teeth to normally look like."
