Sand over the patch to create an even surface. Use a drywall sanding sponge to sand over the patch for a smooth finish. Sand in gentle circular motions and blend the edges where the patch connects to the drywall.Blending the edges of the patch will make it less visible when you paint over it. Apply a layer of spray wall texture over the patch and wait for it to dry. The drywall that you used for the patch may not match the texture of the surrounding wall, which can cause it to stand out when you paint over it. To match the texture, use a can of spray wall texture and apply it over the patch and the edge where the patch meets the wall.Hold the can about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the wall and apply a thin layer. Check the packaging to see how long the wall texture takes to dry. Adjust the nozzle on the can of wall texture to match the texture of your drywall. Paint over the patch to blend it with the wall. Once the texture has fully dried, use the same paint color as the surrounding wall to paint over it. Use a clean paintbrush to apply the paint with smooth, up and down strokes until the patch is blended with the wall.Take paint chips to a paint supply store to match the paint as closely as you can.",

    "Covering Nail or Screw Pops Use 1.25 in (3.2 cm) drywall screws to repair the popped nail or screw.",
    "A nail or screw pop is a drywall fastener that becomes exposed, leaving the head of the nail or screw visible.",
    "When you repair a nail pop, you need to use small drywall screws so you don\u2019t tear the paper of the drywall or crack it.They also need to be able to be driven deep enough into the drywall that they\u2019re lower than the popped nail or screw.",
    "Drill a screw 2 inches (5.1 cm) above and below the exposed nail.",
    "To prevent the wall from crumbling or cracking when you repair the nail pop, drill a drywall screw above and below it so the drywall is held securely.",
    "Screw them in slowly until the head of the screw is just below the surface of the wall.Be careful not to drill too deep or you can crack the drywall or tear the paper coating.",
    "Drive the popped nail or screw about \u204416 inch (0.16 cm) into the drywall.",
    "To be able to cover up the nail or screw pop effectively, you need to drive it a little bit further into the wall.",
    "If it\u2019s a screw pop, use your drill to drive the screw a little bit further into the wall.",
    "If it\u2019s a nail pop, use a hammer to tap the nail further into the drywall.Don\u2019t drill too quickly or you could drive the screw too far and will leave a dent when you cover it up.",
    "If you\u2019re using a hammer, be careful not to dent or crack the drywall surrounding the nail.",
    "Just tap the head of the nail to knock it a little further into the wall.",

    "Use a putty knife to scrape a layer of compound over the popped nail or screw, as well as the drywall screws that you drilled into the drywall so that they\u2019re covered in an even layer.",
    "Use the edge of the putty knife to smooth out the surface of the compound.There should be enough compound to completely fill in the popped nail or screw.",
    "Allow the drywall joint compound to dry for 24 hours.",
    "The compound needs to fully dry before you polish it and prepare it for painting.",
    "Wait a full day before you continue so the compound has completely dried and hardened.Tip: Rub your hand over the surface of the compound to make sure it\u2019s dry.",
    "Sand over the compound with a sanding sponge.",
    "Take a drywall sanding sponge and rub the surface of the drywall and the joint compound to create a smooth surface that can be painted.",
    "Use gently, circular motions to sand the surface.Pay extra attention to the edges of the compound so it isn\u2019t detectable when you paint over it.",
