          "description":"You can use a plunger to clear the clog just like in your toilet at home. Add some water to the toilet bowl if there isn\u2019t any already. Then, put the plunger over the hole. Make sure it completely covers the hole. Pump the plunger up and down vigorously 15-20 times. Then, flush the toilet to check the drainage. If plunging once doesn\u2019t solve the problem, you can repeat 2-3 more times, or try another method to clear the clog."

          "description":"Sometimes a plunger doesn\u2019t fit well into the toilets on some RVs. In this case, try using a slim toilet snake, sometimes also called an auger. This flexible coil of wire can snake through the toilet drain to break down an obstruction. Simply push it down the toilet until you hit the clog. Twist and push the snake to break the clog into smaller pieces so it can pass through to the black water tank. Breaking up the clog with a snake may take 15-20 minutes of maneuvering, so be patient."

You will probably need to snake it through a window of the RV. Turn it on full pressure to push the clog out of the pipe. Keep the hose running until your indicator says the black water tank is full. Attach a flexible tank wand to your hose for narrow pipes. A flexible tank wand is a flexible piece of tubing you can attach to the end of your hose. It\u2019s narrow and bendy so it may be easier to navigate down your RV toilet if it is especially narrow."

Pour the declogger in the bowl. After a couple hours, flush the toilet. Drive your RV around for 30 minutes or so to agitate the liquid in the black water tank. After, check the toilet again to see if the clog has cleared. Check the label to make sure your product is safe to use for septic systems. You can repeat the process once more if the clog is still there, but if after 2 applications of chemical declogger the toilet is still clogged, call a professional RV plumber."

Then, open the toilet valve and pour the boiling water down the toilet. Repeat 2-3 times if necessary. Let it sit for a few hours or overnight before you try to flush the toilet again. Make sure the water really is boiling hot or it won\u2019t be as effective at dissolving the clog.
