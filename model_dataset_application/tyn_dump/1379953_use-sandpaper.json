          "description":"Sandpaper comes in different materials. Each material works best with particular types of sanding. Your options are:\n\nGarnet. Garnet is a natural abrasive used for sanding any kind of bare wood. Garnet is versatile, but it dulls faster than other sandpapers. Silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is best used for sanding down joint compound (the thick mix used to plaster over seams in drywall) and getting out specks of dust that get trapped under your wood finish. Aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide can be used to sand down wood, metal, and paint. It\u2019s duller than silicon carbide, but it lasts longer. Ceramic. Mostly used for power sanding, ceramic is one of the most durable and expensive abrasives. Alumina zirconia. A hard and durable abrasive. Use alumina zirconia if you're using a machine with a disc or belt."

          "description":"Sandpaper comes in three grades: coarse, medium, and fine. Sandpaper grades are measured in \u201cgrit.\u201d The higher the grit of a sandpaper, the smoother it will make the surface it\u2019s used on. Check the packaging the sandpaper comes in to see what its grit is. Buy some sheets in each grade for your project. Coarse-grade sandpaper has a grit of 40 to 80. An 80-grit sandpaper should be coarse enough unless you have significant defects in the surface you\u2019ll be sanding. Medium-grade sandpaper has a grit of 100 to 150. Fine-grade sandpaper has a grit of 180 to 220. A 220-grit sandpaper should be fine enough for your project, but there are higher grits if you want a smoother finish."

Open-coat sandpaper has less grain on it, so it's not as effective, but the extra space on the sheet prevents buildup, which makes it last longer. Use closed-coat sandpaper for harder surfaces and open-coat sandpaper for softer surfaces."
