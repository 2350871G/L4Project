Purchase a package of cream cheese (8 ounces, 226 grams) and warm it up in the microwave to soften it. Place it in a bowl, and then add half a cup of sugar, one egg, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Stir all of these together thoroughly. Once the ingredients are mixed, pour it over the uncooked brownie batter in the pan. Take a knife and swirl the cream cheese mixture throughout the brownie batter, making a neat marbleized pattern. Bake your brownies like normal."

Other options are maraschino cherries, raspberries, or even blueberries. If you're adding canned fruit to your brownies, you can substitute the oil in the brownie recipe for the juices in the can. This will make your brownies deliciously fruity and lower in fat. If your goal is healthy (or healthier) brownies, add in some flaxseed. Flaxseed is a super food that is high in fiber and Omega-3 fatty acids."

When you slice them, you'll have a decadent layer of caramel in the middle! The candies work well to hold the caramel in a layer.

Simply press your cookie dough into the bottom of your pan, covering the entire thing as if you were making one huge cookie. Then, pour your brownie batter over the top.
