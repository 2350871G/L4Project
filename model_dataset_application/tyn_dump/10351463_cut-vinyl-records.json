          "headline":"Put the vinyl record in the oven for 2-3 minutes.",
          "description":"Set the record on the center rack. It can go directly into the oven or onto a baking tray. Turn on the oven\u2019s interior light if it has one so you can watch the vinyl heat. Use oven mitts to take the vinyl out of the oven before it starts to droop or melt. The heat softens the vinyl, making it easier to cut. Leave your oven on until you\u2019re completely finished with your cuts in case you need to reheat your vinyl. Cover a baking tray with aluminum foil before putting the vinyl record on it. This protects the baking tray from any melted vinyl."

          "description":"As you work with the vinyl, it will start to solidify as it loses temperature. Set the record back on the center rack of your oven for 1-2 minutes to soften it to a workable temperature again. Repeat this as many times as you need until you\u2019ve finished cutting your vinyl record. Turn off your oven when you make your last cuts."

Do not touch the blade of the knife once it\u2019s heated. Work on a wooden or heat-resistant surface so your knife doesn\u2019t burn through it when you make your cuts. Keep the knife out of children\u2019s reach. Many hot knives will have a built-in stand to hold the blade off the table."

          "description":"Slowly stab the tip of the hot knife through the vinyl record. Once you\u2019re through the vinyl, pull the knife at a steady speed along the line you want to cut. Follow all of your lines until you\u2019ve completely cut out your design. Turn off the knife and let it cool down once you finish. Vinyl contains chlorine gas that could escape when it\u2019s heated. Wear a facemask while cutting the vinyl with a hotknife. Don\u2019t hold the knife in one spot for too long or else the vinyl will melt and bubble. Keep the knife stationary and move the record with your other hand if that\u2019s more comfortable."

For more intricate pieces, hold the cutouts as close to the edge as possible so they don\u2019t break off when you try to separate the pieces."

Once you have the record down to size, trace it onto a piece of felt and cut it out. Attach the felt to the bottom of the record label with spray adhesive.
