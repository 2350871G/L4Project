  "text":" Toasting on the Stove Top Put a medium-sized pan on medium heat. Get a non-stick medium-sized skillet or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Place the pan on a burner and turn it on medium heat. Give it a minute or so to heat up. Spread butter on one side of the bread. While your skillet is heating up on the burner, use a butter knife to spread some butter on one side of your slice of bread. Store your butter in a butter dish and keep it on the kitchen counter so that it\u2019s soft and spreadable. If the knife is sticking to the bread too much, hold down a corner of the slice of bread with one of your fingers to keep it in place. Place the bread in the pan butter side-down. Once buttered, place your slice of bread in the skillet. The buttered side should be the side that\u2019s in contact with the skillet. Cover the bread for 2 minutes. Get a heavy pot lid and place it over the skillet for 2 minutes. This will trap the heat in and make the bread toast faster. If your stovetop runs hot or you don\u2019t want your toast to be crispy, put the heat on low. Butter the other side and flip the bread. Once the 2 minutes is up, take the lid off. Spread some butter on the side that\u2019s still facing up while keeping it in the skillet. Then use a spatula to flip the slice of bread over. Cover the bread and remove it from the heat after another 2 minutes. Put the lid back on the skillet and wait another 2 minutes. Then, use a spatula to move the toast from the skillet to a plate. Put whatever toppings or spreads you want on your toast and enjoy! Broiling in the Oven Move your oven rack to the topmost rung. The broiler is located near the top of the oven. Move the rack in order to make sure the bread is kept as close to the broiler as possible while in the oven. Set the oven to broil and let it preheat. There\u2019s likely an \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d button for your broiler, but there may also be a \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d option. Press \u201con\u201d and/or \u201chigh\u201d and give the broiler about 5 minutes to warm up. Put the bread on a baking sheet and slide it onto the top rack. Put your slice of bread on an ungreased baking sheet. Place the baking sheet on the top rack so that it\u2019s nearest to the heat. If you don\u2019t have a baking sheet, you can also carefully place the bread directly onto the oven grates. Baking sheets are typically big, so this is a good option if you\u2019re making several pieces of toast at once. Flip the bread after 1-2 minutes have gone by. Keep a close eye on the bread. The broiler\u2019s high heat will make the toast desirably crispy, but may also burn the toast if left unattended. Use some oven-safe tongs to flip your slice of bread after one or two minutes have passed. Take the bread out of the oven after another 1-2 minutes. Once another one or two minutes have gone by, put on some oven mitts and take the baking sheet out of the oven. Use tongs to move the toast from the sheet to a plate and put on any spreads or toppings that you want. Slow-Toasting in the Oven Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Set your oven to a lower temperature setting, ideally 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176.7 degrees Celsius). Wait until you hear the oven beep to put in your bread. Put the bread on a baking sheet and slide it onto the middle rack. Put the baking sheet on the oven rack that\u2019s most centrally located in order to toast the bread evenly. Flip the bread after about 5 minutes. After five minutes have passed, open the oven door and use tongs to flip your slice of bread onto its other side. Take the bread out of the oven after another 5 minutes. Make sure to wear oven mitts when you take the baking sheet out. Use the tongs to bring the toast from the baking sheet to your plate. After putting whatever spreads or toppings you want on your toast, it\u2019ll be ready to eat. Try a classic spread or topping, such as peanut butter, nutella, or cinnamon and sugar. If you want to get a little more creative, top your toast with fig jam, goat cheese, and walnuts or hummus and olive tapenade. Making Toast on a Campfire Find a safe place to start your fire.

Lay tinder, such as paper strips, and kindling, such as twigs or cardboard, inside the circle. Light the fire with a lighter and blow on it softly until it catches and spreads.
