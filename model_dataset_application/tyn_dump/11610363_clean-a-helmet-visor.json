Cover the visor with your wash cloth by draping it over the helmet. If the wash cloth looks like it\u2019s going to slide off, stuff a towel under the chin to raise the helmet up a little. This will soften any dead bugs or clumps of dried dirt.Variation: If your visor is really nasty, you can soak it in hot water and mild dish soap for 3-5 minutes after removing it from the helmet. Make sure that you have an anti-fog shield that can withstand soap though before doing this. Consult your helmet\u2019s instruction manual to determine whether your anti-fog shield can withstand soap. If you don\u2019t have any residue stuck on your helmet, skip this step. Even if it looks like you could scrape or scrub the bugs and dirt off, don\u2019t do it. You may end up scratching the visor."

Don\u2019t apply a lot of pressure while doing this. It should feel like you\u2019re grazing the visor with your cloth.
