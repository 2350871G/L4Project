If you accidentally add too much water, either carefully pour some out or add more stones underneath of your bulbs. Put your container into the fridge for 1 month. The water needs to be kept cool to force your bulbs to bloom. Put your container in the fridge where it can sit upright undisturbed. Make sure your fridge stays below 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C).
