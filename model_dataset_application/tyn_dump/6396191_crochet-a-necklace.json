Keep the knot tight to prevent it from coming undone. Use three different colors. Consider choosing a metallic or glitter-accented yarn for one or two of the colors to make the piece more visually interesting. You can technically make this necklace with only one strand of yarn in one color, but using three colors will make the necklace sturdier and more aesthetically complex."

The exact number of chain stitches will vary depending on how many wrap-arounds you'd prefer and how snug you want the necklace to be. For a short necklace that wraps around your neck four times, you'll need approximately 90 chains. For a long necklace that wraps around your neck six times, you'll need approximately 270 chains.
