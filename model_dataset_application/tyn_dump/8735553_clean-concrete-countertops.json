You can then dip a soft cloth or sponge into this mixture and use it to wipe down your countertops. Wring it out so that the cloth or sponge is damp, not soaking wet, before wiping. This is a mild method that can work for both sealed and unsealed types of concrete countertops. This is a great way to clean prior to putting on a new coat of sealant.

To prevent this from happening, you may need to polish out the spot with a low grit diamond wiping pad and then reapply sealer as directed on the package.
