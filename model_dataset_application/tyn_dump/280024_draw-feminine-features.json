Again, femininity is associated with softness and roundness--and in this particular case, a smaller size. Larger noses are considered more masculine than smaller ones. You may use sharper angles on the tip of the nose if you like, but articulate everything very softly. The fewer lines and the lighter the shading, the better. Illustrate the bridge as little as possible. The alae (the 'wings' protruding from each side of the nose) should be drawn in very lightly, if at all."

Typically the upper and lower lips will seem asymmetrical, with the lower being thicker, and the upper thinner. Often this is because the 'face' of the upper lip is slanted slightly downward, reducing the view. The mouth is possibly the easiest to 'feminize'. As long as both lips, both upper and lower, are well articulated, you're good to go."

Femininity is summed up by the softly curved, rounded hourglass silhouette. The top of the hourglass is not created by the breasts--it is created by the shoulders. The shoulders and hips should be spaced roughly equal, with the torso narrowing significantly in the midsection. The narrowest spot should be just below the ribs, and just above the navel. Creating this silhouette will feminize even the most poorly 'endowed' figures. When articulating the abdomen, many people gravitate to a completely straight, even concave belly. Even when illustrating a very fit woman, the very curve of her frame will create a gentle, round slope beginning at the navel and descending to the groin. The buttocks are similar in that extra roundness in this area will feminize any silhouette (male or female!)"

          "description":"Female limbs are generally more slender than male limbs, and less muscularly articulated. This is because women have a greater ratio of body fat to muscle mass than men do. This obscures most of the muscular striations. Because of this, articulate your muscles softly. It is not necessary to make your females flaccid and unfit to feminize them, simply use a gentle hand and avoid hard, sharp lines when illustrating muscles. It is also important to note that women carry more mass (fat and muscle) below the waist than above it, and the legs will often be round and substantial, even with slender arms. Work hard on the hands. A small palm with slender fingers, tapered at the tips to avoid looking 'stubby'. The wrist bone will also be more pronounced here than on most male figures. Work equally hard on the feet. As above. Small, slender, with more articulated anklebones."
