Use a long wooden spoon to stir this mixture together until the dish soap is completely mixed with the water. Use a mild dish soap to avoid inadvertently damaging the slate on your hearth. You can also use an all-purpose surface cleaner if you don\u2019t have any mild dish soap. Avoid using a bucket that\u2019s too small. You should mix the dish soap with at least 2 cups (470 mL) of water."

Don\u2019t apply too much pressure when you go to scrub the slate. If a gentle once-over isn\u2019t enough to clean off any dirt and grime on your hearth, use a more powerful cleaning solution instead.

You can also use a sponge soaked in clean water if you don\u2019t have a spray bottle handy. You should also allow the hearth to air dry overnight if you intend to polish it after you clean it."

You can buy reasonably priced teak oil at most large hardware stores. You can also use slate oil instead of teak oil, although the former is usually more expensive and a bit harder to find in stores. Teak oil also helps hide scratches on your hearth, making it easier to seal."
