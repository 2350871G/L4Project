Once you have a pile about the size of a quarter, you can stop. Be careful to keep the spore pile on the piece of paper. You can also purchase spores in little packets from nurseries if you don't have access to a fern leaf."

Then add a 1- to 2-inch (2.5 to 5 cm) layer of fine perlite, followed by a 2- to 3-inch (5 to 7.5 cm) layer of peat moss. Press the peat moss down with your fingers so that the top is flat and even. Since the container will be heated in the microwave, be sure it is microwave safe. Make sure the container is large enough to leave several inches between the mixture and the lid. This will allow the fern room to grow.

You can transplant three or four baby ferns together into the same small pot if you want to. Just be sure to allow about an inch (2.5 cm) of space around each one for its roots to grow.

Find a commercial fern fertilizer at a garden center or nursery and mix it with water to cut down on the strength. Pour a spray bottle half full of fertilizer and fill the other half with water. Then follow the product instructions for application. Mounting a Staghorn Fern Find a plank of wood larger than the base of your fern. When your fern has matured and has reached a few inches wide and tall, you can mount it on the wall. Find a piece of wood that you like the look of, and make sure it's longer and wider than the base of your fern. Install hanging hardware to the back of the wood. Purchase a pack of hardware used for hanging heavy pictures or mirrors. Before you begin mounting the fern, attach the hardware to the back of your piece of wood where you'd like it to attach to the wall. Trace a circle in the middle of the wood. Use a cup or a bowl that's about the width of the base of your fern. Place it in the middle of the wood and trace a circle with a pen or marker. You can also move it a little up or down if you don't want it exactly in the middle. Hammer in nails all the way around the circle. Get eight or so small nails and hammer them along the edge of the circle you traced, spacing them evenly. If your circle was large, you may need more than eight nails. Leave less than a centimeter of nail poking up out of the wood. Place your pruned fern inside the circle of nails. Gently pull your staghorn fern from its pot or container and place the whole root system in the middle of the nails. Prune the roots back a little with scissors or shears so that they fit inside the circle. Cover the base of the fern with peat moss. Dampen handfuls of peat moss and wrap them around the base of your fern, covering the roots. Make sure the peat moss is damp enough that it sticks where you press it down. Tie the fern down by crisscrossing twine around the nails. Take burlap twine or baker's twine and tie a knot on one end. Tie that knot around one of the nails, and then start crisscrossing the twine over the peat moss. Wrap it around a nail on one side of the plant before crossing back over the roots to tie it on a nail on the other side. Continue until you feel like the plant is secure. Hang your fern in bright, indirect sunlight. Find a spot in your home to hang the fern where it won't receive any direct sunlight. Indirect natural light and steady, mild temperatures are best. Water the mounted fern once a week in the shower. Water your staghorn fern by taking the mount off the wall and placing the entire thing in the shower. Spray water over it for about ten minutes and then allow it to drip dry. Brush off excess moisture from both the wood and the fronds with a dry cloth, then rehang the fern. Prune the fern periodically to maintain its weight. Staghorn ferns can grow to well over 100 pounds (45 kg), which makes them impractical for mounting.
