Peeling the shrimp opens up the flesh, making it easier to slice into it and create a butterflied shape. The tail may either be left in place or removed, depending on how you want your shrimp to look. To peel your shrimp,\nPull off the heads (if your shrimp came with heads attached). Pull off the legs. Peel off the shells - slip your fingers under near the head, then peel it off the body. Leave the tails on or remove them."

Position a paring knife at the head part of the shrimp, and gently slice along the shrimp's back to expose the digestive tract. Lift it out of the shrimp and wipe it off on a paper towel. If the tract breaks up into pieces, run the shrimp under a stream of water for a few seconds to wash it out. You can also use a shrimp deveiner to remove the digestive tract from smaller shrimp."

          "description":"Turn the shrimp over to check if it has a visible nerve cord, which runs along the inside curve. If you see a dark line there, you might want to remove it. The nerve cord is edible, but it can affect the appearance of the dish. To remove it, gently run the paring knife along the nerve cord to cut through the flesh and expose it. Lift the nerve cord from the shrimp and discard it. You can skip this step if you're battering and frying the shrimp, or if you don't mind the nerve cord being visible. Removing the nerve cord is a little trickier than removing the digestive tract. Be careful not to slice the shrimp all the way through."
