You might even mix it with granola or cereal to give a healthy start to your day. However, since many Icelanders consider skyr an on-the-go treat, single serving cups equipped with a disposable spoon are common. You can add ingredients to your skyr to transform its flavor.

You may want to choose the flavor of skyr according to what you'll be dipping into it. For example:\nSweet flavored crackers and cookies might pair better with sweeter flavored skyr, like vanilla or strawberry. When dipping foods that are more savory into the skyr, a plain or savory flavor will likely pair best. Try mixing a little olive, salt, and pepper into it and eating it with crackers."

Generally you can expect your smoothies to stay good, when refrigerated when stored in an airtight container, for 12 hours to a day, depending on the ingredients you've used. When storing your smoothie, fill its storage container to the very top. Excess air in the container will cause nutrients to oxidize and break down."
