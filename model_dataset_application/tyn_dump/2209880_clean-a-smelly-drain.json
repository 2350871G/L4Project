Even if this debris isn\u2019t the immediate cause of the smell, it eventually attracts smelly bacteria and even forms clogs.

Buildup like hair and grease not only makes the plug smell, but it may turn into a smelly clog inside the drain pipe. Spraying white vinegar on the drain plug also helps remove debris. Another option is to heat a pot of vinegar until it bubbles gently, then leave the drain plug in it for a few minutes."

Plastic drain sticks are the cheapest tools available, and all you do is lower the stick down and pull it back up to remove the clog piece by piece. Wash off the tool and use it repeatedly until most of the material causing the clog is gone. Create your own drain stick out of a wire hanger. Straighten it out, adjusting the end into a hook that fits down the drain. Then, use it to pull out hair and other material in the drain. For a more effective drain-clearing tool, purchase an auger or drain snake from a general store. Augurs are longer than plastic sticks and more effective at breaking up solid clogs. Rotate the auger in the drain to loosen the nasty gunk on the walls."
