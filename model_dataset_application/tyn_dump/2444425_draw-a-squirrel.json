          "description":"To start, use your pencil to lightly sketch out a circle where you want to place your cartoon squirrel\u2019s head. Add 2 small, pointy triangles to the top left and top right of the circle to give your squirrel some ears. The triangles should each be \u00bc the size of the circle. This method involves a lot of erasing, so don\u2019t use a pen to do this. You can always outline your illustration in pen after you finish the sketch."

          "description":"To draw your squirrel\u2019s body, draw 1 line coming down from slightly left of the center of the head. This line should be roughly the same height as the circle you drew for the head. Add a second, longer, parallel line from just inside the right edge of your circle. Bring this line down and connect it to the first line you drew with a horizontal line to create the base. This should look like you drew a rectangle with the top portion of the left side tucked behind your circle. If it\u2019s easier for you, feel free to simply sketch the entire rectangle out and erase the lines inside of the circle."

          "description":"To give your squirrel some paws to rest on, add 2 small rectangles extending out the side of the body you drew. These rectangles should be fairly thin, roughly 1/5 the width and length of the bigger rectangle that you\u2019ve drawn. Place them flush with the bottom line of the body and point them in opposite directions to give your squirrel its feet. Start on the outside edge of the body and work your way out. All of the smaller rectangles that you\u2019re drawing should be really light. You\u2019re going to do a fair bit of erasing here."

          "description":"The legs for your cartoon squirrel are rounded over the feet to make it seem like your squirrel is sitting down. Draw 2 small ovals that are roughly the same size as your feet. Add them pointing out at the 90-degree junction where your feet meet the body. Hide the bottom of each oval behind the rectangles and have them point out at 45-degree angle. This should look like you drew 2 eggs tucked behind the rectangles that you\u2019ve just illustrated to make the feet."

          "description":"To give your squirrel its front legs, draw 2 tiny, vertical rectangles at the bottom right and bottom left of the body so that they share an exterior side with the body. These tiny rectangles will function as the front legs and make it seem like your squirrel is leaning forward on its paws. On the bottom of each of these rectangles, add 2 flat rectangles that are slightly shorter in length than the feet behind them.Tip: While their legs are roughly the same size in real life, cartoon squirrels typically have bigger back legs than front legs. The front paws must extend further than the base of the body."

The top of this rectangle should lead behind the right ear and extend to the right. The bottom of the rectangle should stick out from the back foot on the right. Starting at the top of this rectangle, add a smaller rectangle extending out of the top and leading away from the body. Add a third, smaller rectangle attached to the second rectangle. This will look like a sequence of several rectangles falling out of the top of the tail behind the squirrel. The rectangles in the tail should get progressively smaller as they lead towards the ground. Each rectangle should be roughly 1/2 the size of the previous rectangle."

Then, erase the lines where the ovals for the back legs meet the feet, leaving the body lines intact. Remove the lines where the front legs and front feet meet. Erase the lines in the tail where the rectangles meet or overlap."

Round the ears out on the sides a little and draw a smaller outline inside of each ear to give the squirrel some inner ears. Smooth out the lines for the back legs. Round the front feet out to give your squirrel some fingers. For the tail, round it out by connecting the edges of the rectangles with a smooth, round line and erase the rest of the lines. The tail should end up being roughly the same size as the body, head, and feet combined. The level of detail that you choose to give your squirrel is totally up to you. You can leave the shapes fairly geometric, or you can rework your features entirely to smooth them out. To make the front legs look more realistic, make the top of each leg thinner than the bottom where it connects to the paws."

Put 2 small dots closer to the nose to give the squirrel pupils. At the junction where the left side of the head meets the body, draw 2 small squares next to one another and erase the lines underneath to give your squirrel the iconic buck teeth. You can connect the 2 eyes in the middle to make it 1 shape if you really want to make your squirrel look cartoonish. You can draw a rectangle with a rounded top inside of the front legs to give your squirrel a belly."

Color the body a lighter shade of gray and make the nose pink. Leave the belly and inside of the eyes white. If you want to give the cartoon some definition, outline your entire sketch in a thin, black marker. This is entirely optional. You can leave your squirrel uncolored if you\u2019d like. You can make your squirrel whatever color you\u2019d like. Other common colors for squirrels include black, gray, brown, and dark yellow."

Add the second ear on the left side of the head with the bottom tucked behind the head.Tip: Make the left ear\u2019s left side a little rounder. The left ear is actually the back of the squirrel\u2019s ear while the right ear is facing forward. The right ear should be roughly 1/4 the size of the head.

At the junction where the foot meets the bottom of the body, draw a large S-shape with the bottom half of the S tucked inside of the body and the top of the S extending past the top of your squirrel. This S shape is the central line for your tail. Feel free to make it curl however you\u2019d like above the body. Generally, the top of the S should be bigger than the bottom of your S.\nWhen squirrels sit, their tails don\u2019t really extend away from their body. Instead, they sort of pop up above it and then curl back into the body.

Then, change your angle to follow the rest of your tail into the squirrel\u2019s backside. As you get closer to the body, the thickness of the tail must get progressively smaller until it leads into the squirrel\u2019s bottom and disappears behind it.

Use your pencil or a pen to fill in the eye, leaving a small circular spot in the top right of the eye uncolored to make it look like it\u2019s reflecting light. Give the bottom of the eye a little point to give it some definition.

These are really small features, so don\u2019t go overboard. Place a small arcing line in between the eye and the cheek to make it seem round. Unlike most of the cartoon drawings of squirrels you\u2019ve seen, a squirrel\u2019s nose, mouth, and cheeks are actually really small."

Continue adding small lines along the outer edge of the tail until it has some shape and texture. For a realistic squirrel, you\u2019re not going to use any smooth lines to outline the tail."

Outline the bottom of the front paw and use a few thin lines to draw the belly sticking out. Each paw should be roughly the same size as the squirrel\u2019s eye. The toes should be approximately twice the length as the paws. Draw a fold into the middle of the squirrel\u2019s left ear by drawing a Y-shape and shading the area above the junction where the top bars meet.

Layer dozens of lines on top of one another until you\u2019re happy with the look of the tail. For the body, use cross hatching to give texture to the darker parts at the bottom of the body, at the back paw, and behind the ear. Draw a sequence of parallel lines and then use a set of perpendicular lines to create some darker fur.Tip: If you outlined in marker, consider adding an additional layer of shading with your pencil by cross hatching and using back-and-forth strokes around the fur and texture lines. You have a lot of freedom when it comes to how you give your squirrel some texture. If you\u2019re planning on coloring your squirrel, feel free to use a colored marker or colored pencil to do this. If you want to draw whiskers, make them extremely thin and light. Place 3-5 whiskers just to the right of the nose, angling downwards over the paw. Place 3-5 symmetrical, smaller whiskers on the other side of the nose leading away from the body in the opposite direction."

Blend your pencil marks with a kneaded eraser or by rubbing the drawing with your finger. Make the bottom and backside of your squirrel\u2019s fur darker than the rest of the body. The top and head of your squirrel should be the lightest."

  "text":" Drawing a Cartoon Squirrel Draw a circle with 2 small triangles on top to make the head. To start, use your pencil to lightly sketch out a circle where you want to place your cartoon squirrel\u2019s head. Add 2 small, pointy triangles to the top left and top right of the circle to give your squirrel some ears. The triangles should each be \u00bc the size of the circle. This method involves a lot of erasing, so don\u2019t use a pen to do this. You can always outline your illustration in pen after you finish the sketch. Add a tall rectangle under the circle to add the body. To draw your squirrel\u2019s body, draw 1 line coming down from slightly left of the center of the head. This line should be roughly the same height as the circle you drew for the head. Add a second, longer, parallel line from just inside the right edge of your circle. Bring this line down and connect it to the first line you drew with a horizontal line to create the base. This should look like you drew a rectangle with the top portion of the left side tucked behind your circle. If it\u2019s easier for you, feel free to simply sketch the entire rectangle out and erase the lines inside of the circle. Illustrate 2 symmetrical rectangles at the bottom to make the back feet. To give your squirrel some paws to rest on, add 2 small rectangles extending out the side of the body you drew. These rectangles should be fairly thin, roughly 1/5 the width and length of the bigger rectangle that you\u2019ve drawn. Place them flush with the bottom line of the body and point them in opposite directions to give your squirrel its feet. Start on the outside edge of the body and work your way out. All of the smaller rectangles that you\u2019re drawing should be really light. You\u2019re going to do a fair bit of erasing here. Add 2 small ovals behind the feet to add the back legs. The legs for your cartoon squirrel are rounded over the feet to make it seem like your squirrel is sitting down. Draw 2 small ovals that are roughly the same size as your feet. Add them pointing out at the 90-degree junction where your feet meet the body. Hide the bottom of each oval behind the rectangles and have them point out at 45-degree angle. This should look like you drew 2 eggs tucked behind the rectangles that you\u2019ve just illustrated to make the feet. Draw the front legs and feet by adding smaller rectangles in front. To give your squirrel its front legs, draw 2 tiny, vertical rectangles at the bottom right and bottom left of the body so that they share an exterior side with the body. These tiny rectangles will function as the front legs and make it seem like your squirrel is leaning forward on its paws. On the bottom of each of these rectangles, add 2 flat rectangles that are slightly shorter in length than the feet behind them.Tip: While their legs are roughly the same size in real life, cartoon squirrels typically have bigger back legs than front legs. The front paws must extend further than the base of the body. Add the tail by drawing a sequence of rectangles behind the squirrel. To give your squirrel its iconic, massive tail, start by drawing a big, vertical rectangle behind the body. The top of this rectangle should lead behind the right ear and extend to the right. The bottom of the rectangle should stick out from the back foot on the right. Starting at the top of this rectangle, add a smaller rectangle extending out of the top and leading away from the body. Add a third, smaller rectangle attached to the second rectangle. This will look like a sequence of several rectangles falling out of the top of the tail behind the squirrel. The rectangles in the tail should get progressively smaller as they lead towards the ground. Each rectangle should be roughly 1/2 the size of the previous rectangle. Erase the overlapping lines for the body and back legs. Use an eraser to remove the bottom right of the head where it meets the body to make it one shape. Then, erase the lines where the ovals for the back legs meet the feet, leaving the body lines intact. Remove the lines where the front legs and front feet meet. Erase the lines in the tail where the rectangles meet or overlap. Give the legs, ears, and tails some detail. With your outline in place, begin to give the features some definition. Round the ears out on the sides a little and draw a smaller outline inside of each ear to give the squirrel some inner ears. Smooth out the lines for the back legs. Round the front feet out to give your squirrel some fingers. For the tail, round it out by connecting the edges of the rectangles with a smooth, round line and erase the rest of the lines. The tail should end up being roughly the same size as the body, head, and feet combined. The level of detail that you choose to give your squirrel is totally up to you. You can leave the shapes fairly geometric, or you can rework your features entirely to smooth them out. To make the front legs look more realistic, make the top of each leg thinner than the bottom where it connects to the paws. Add the eyes, nose, and teeth to the squirrel\u2019s head. Draw a round triangle in the middle of the head to give your squirrel a nose. Draw 2 massive eyes, making the right eye slightly bigger than the left. Put 2 small dots closer to the nose to give the squirrel pupils. At the junction where the left side of the head meets the body, draw 2 small squares next to one another and erase the lines underneath to give your squirrel the iconic buck teeth. You can connect the 2 eyes in the middle to make it 1 shape if you really want to make your squirrel look cartoonish. You can draw a rectangle with a rounded top inside of the front legs to give your squirrel a belly. Color your cartoon squirrel and outline as desired. Use markers, crayons, or colored pencils to give your squirrel some color. Make the tail and inside of the ears a dark gray. Color the body a lighter shade of gray and make the nose pink. Leave the belly and inside of the eyes white. If you want to give the cartoon some definition, outline your entire sketch in a thin, black marker. This is entirely optional. You can leave your squirrel uncolored if you\u2019d like. You can make your squirrel whatever color you\u2019d like. Other common colors for squirrels include black, gray, brown, and dark yellow. Sketching a Realistic Squirrel Draw a large circle, roughly 4\u20135 in (10\u201313 cm) in diameter, to serve as a guiding line. To draw a realistic squirrel, grab a pencil so that you can shade your drawing, add texture, and erase lines that you don\u2019t need. Use your pencil to sketch a large circle. This will serve as the main portion of the body and provide a base for your illustration. You cannot perform the initial sketching with a marker or pen. You\u2019re going to be doing a lot of erasing and blending with your pencil, and markers and pens can\u2019t erase or blend the way a pencil does. Add an oval floating 1\u20131.5 in (2.5\u20133.8 cm) above the top left of your body. Place the outline of your head by drawing an oval that is slightly pointed at the bottom. This is not a super sharp point, but more of a sequence of short, angular lines leading down towards the nose. Point the angled side of the oval at a 45-degree angle, aimed away from the large circle you drew. Place the oval outside the top left of the body. This oval should be roughly 1/3 the size of the body. If you want to draw your squirrel facing the right, simply reverse these instructions. Connect the top of the head to the top of the body. Starting at the top right of the head, draw a line connecting the head to the top left of the body. Make this line dip 1\u20132 millimetres (0.039\u20130.079 in) in the middle to give the neck some slack. Add your ears, making the right ear bigger than the left. Start by drawing the left side of the right ear. Start in the middle of the head, just below the top of your oval. Draw the left side arcing back towards the body. Once it extends past the head a little, draw the right side arcing back towards the head to give the ear an angular-oval shape. Add the second ear on the left side of the head with the bottom tucked behind the head.Tip: Make the left ear\u2019s left side a little rounder. The left ear is actually the back of the squirrel\u2019s ear while the right ear is facing forward. The right ear should be roughly 1/4 the size of the head. The left ear should be roughly 1/2 the size of the right ear. The right ear refers to your right, not the squirrel\u2019s. The squirrel\u2019s left ear is the bigger one. Sketch the front leg overlapping the body and leading into the tail. Start in the middle of the body to the left of the center. Draw a round half-circle, roughly half the height of the body, extending towards the head. Once you get past the bottom of the body, add the foot by drawing a thin oblong curled under the body. Connect the back of the foot to the body with a small line. At the junction where the foot meets the bottom of the body, draw a large S-shape with the bottom half of the S tucked inside of the body and the top of the S extending past the top of your squirrel. This S shape is the central line for your tail. Feel free to make it curl however you\u2019d like above the body. Generally, the top of the S should be bigger than the bottom of your S.\nWhen squirrels sit, their tails don\u2019t really extend away from their body. Instead, they sort of pop up above it and then curl back into the body. The overall height of your S-shape should be roughly the same length as your squirrel from the left side of the head to the right side of the body. Complete the tail by curling it back into the body. At the end of the top of your S, draw another line starting on the body-side of the S\u2019s edge. Follow the outline of the S until you reach the top of the S\u2019s arc. Then, change your angle to follow the rest of your tail into the squirrel\u2019s backside. As you get closer to the body, the thickness of the tail must get progressively smaller until it leads into the squirrel\u2019s bottom and disappears behind it. If you want to draw the squirrel sitting on a stone, log, or wire, sketch that under the squirrel\u2019s feet. Add a front paw under the head, hanging down. On the bottom right of the head, draw a curled limb extending under the head. Put a little circle at the end of the limb, hanging down a little, to give the leg a tiny paw. Draw an arcing line extending out of the bottom right of the paw and leading back into the middle of the body to finish the arm. This paw should be roughly 1/5 the size of the head. You can make the paw really round to make the squirrel seem cuter, or make it kind of pointy and angular to make the squirrel seem a little feral. Don\u2019t worry about fingers or details just yet; you\u2019re still sketching out the basic shapes of the squirrel. Sketch a beady eye in the middle of the squirrel\u2019s head. Add an eye that is slightly smaller than the squirrel\u2019s left ear. Give the eye roughly the same shape as the outline of your head, angling downwards away from the body. Use your pencil or a pen to fill in the eye, leaving a small circular spot in the top right of the eye uncolored to make it look like it\u2019s reflecting light. Give the bottom of the eye a little point to give it some definition. If you\u2019re inking your squirrel or outlining it with marker, this is the point where you can put your pencil down and pick up a marker. Add a tiny nose and left cheek to finish the facial features. Using a firmer pencil stroke or a light pen stroke, draw a tiny angular nose in the bottom left of the head. Have it barely extend out past the head and leave the top of the nose open. On the right side of the nose, draw an arcing line leading back into the head. These are really small features, so don\u2019t go overboard. Place a small arcing line in between the eye and the cheek to make it seem round. Unlike most of the cartoon drawings of squirrels you\u2019ve seen, a squirrel\u2019s nose, mouth, and cheeks are actually really small. Outline the lines that you\u2019re keeping with a thin marker. Use a thin-tipped black marker to outline the head, leaving the inside of the right ear undisturbed. Outline your ears, the back, and the belly of the squirrel. Use a sequence of round lines to outline the back where it tucks into the tail. Use an eraser to remove any unnecessary pencil marks that remain. You do not have to use a marker if you don\u2019t want to. You can stick with a pencil if you\u2019d like and simply press it harder into the paper to give your lines more definition. Use a sequence of short lines to outline the tail in fur. Leading away from the body, outline your tail with a sequence of thin, semi-parallel lines. Use a short flicking motion to make the fur on the tail look thinner than the other parts of your squirrel. At the very top of the tail, give the lines a little more curve than the rest of the tail. Continue adding small lines along the outer edge of the tail until it has some shape and texture. For a realistic squirrel, you\u2019re not going to use any smooth lines to outline the tail. Add definition to the smaller features like the legs and paws. Use your marker or firmer pencil strokes to draw 3-4 toes on the bottom paw. Bend each individual toe downwards and make each individual digit really thin. Add fingers to the front paw by drawing really small lines leading from the outer edge of the paw into the arm. Outline the bottom of the front paw and use a few thin lines to draw the belly sticking out. Each paw should be roughly the same size as the squirrel\u2019s eye. The toes should be approximately twice the length as the paws. Draw a fold into the middle of the squirrel\u2019s left ear by drawing a Y-shape and shading the area above the junction where the top bars meet. You can leave the front paw as it is, or draw a second paw behind it leading into the head with the fingers tucked behind the front paw. Give the squirrel some texture by cross hatching and flicking lines. Start with the tail by drawing a variety of small lines leading up and away from the body. Layer dozens of lines on top of one another until you\u2019re happy with the look of the tail. For the body, use cross hatching to give texture to the darker parts at the bottom of the body, at the back paw, and behind the ear. Draw a sequence of parallel lines and then use a set of perpendicular lines to create some darker fur.Tip: If you outlined in marker, consider adding an additional layer of shading with your pencil by cross hatching and using back-and-forth strokes around the fur and texture lines. You have a lot of freedom when it comes to how you give your squirrel some texture. If you\u2019re planning on coloring your squirrel, feel free to use a colored marker or colored pencil to do this. If you want to draw whiskers, make them extremely thin and light. Place 3-5 whiskers just to the right of the nose, angling downwards over the paw. Place 3-5 symmetrical, smaller whiskers on the other side of the nose leading away from the body in the opposite direction. Add subtle grays, red, and browns to give the fur some color if you\u2019d like. You don\u2019t have to color your squirrel, but you can if you\u2019d like to! Use colored pencils for a realistic look. Use a variety of different shades of gray, reds, or browns to fill the fur in. Use a variety of back-and-forth strokes and cross-hatching to create the texture that you\u2019d like to achieve. Blend your pencil marks with a kneaded eraser or by rubbing the drawing with your finger. Make the bottom and backside of your squirrel\u2019s fur darker than the rest of the body. The top and head of your squirrel should be the lightest.",
