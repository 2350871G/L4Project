Acclimatize the tiles in the basement for 48 hours so that the tiles adjust to the relative humidity of the basement.

If a wall-to-wall carpet will be installed on top of the subfloor then it is important to fasten all of the perimeter tiles and a row in the middle  of the subfloor with 2\" Tapcon concrete screws. This will allow for carpet to be stretched without causing the tiles to move. If a nail-down wood floor is installed on top of the subfloor then it is important to glue all the tongue and groove edges together as well as to fasten all of the perimeter tiles and a row in the middle with 2\" Tapcon concrete screws. This will provide a stable rigid subfloor for nail-down hardwood floors. Use 1-1/2\" floor cleats to install the hardwood floor. Install the first row of the subfloor installation until you get to the last tile. Cut the last tile to allow for the 1/2\" spacer. Use a pull bar to pull the last tile into place. Start the second row with a 12\" x 24\" half tile making sure to use the 1/2\" spacers against the foundation wall. This will stagger the tile seams to give the subfloor more structure. Complete the subfloor installation by completing one row at a time checking to make sure the subfloor is level as you go. Most tiles will conform to irregularities in the concrete floor but if leveling is required us flat pieces of polystyrene insulation placed loosely under the tiles. Leave a 1/2\" gap around obstacles in the basement such as support posts, stairs and load-bearing walls. Leave a gap of at least 24\" around the furnace, water heater or fireplace. This space can be finished with ceramic tile. For the last row of the subfloor, cut the tiles to allow for a 1/2\" gap. Use a pull bar or the Barricade installation tool to pull these panels in place. Now that the subfloor has been installed it is time to install the wall panels.  Start at the same starting point on the wall as the subfloor.  Make sure the foundation wall is clear of obstructions that would prevent the installation of the panels.  Calculate where electrical wall outlets and cable boxes will be in the room so that the wall panels can be prepared for the wiring.  Place the first wall panel flat against the foundation wall right into the corner on top of the new subfloor. Cutting the panel may be required to fit the panel around obstacles or irregularities on the wall. Using 2\" Tapcon concrete screws fasten the panel in six locations: two at the top of the panel, two in the middle and two at the bottom, 2\" in from the edge of the panel.  Fit the second panel into the ship lap joint of the first panel and install the six Tapcons.  Continue installing the panels this way around the perimeter of the foundation wall fitting around basement windows and other wall obstacles and irregularities.  Install the specially prepared wall panels for electrical outlets and cable as you have designated them at the outset.  Once you have completed the wall panel installation around the perimeter of the foundation wall, you are ready to install the partition walls on top of the subfloor required for your basement layout.  The installation of the wall panels eliminates the need for a stud wall around the foundation wall.  Either wood or steel stud non-load bearing partition walls can be installed on top of the subfloor. Fasten the base plate of the stud wall with fasteners right to the subfloor. At either end of the 8' base plate use 2\" Tapcons  to  fasten the base plate to the concrete floor.",
