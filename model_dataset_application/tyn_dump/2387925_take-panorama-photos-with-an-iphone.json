Keep your phone steady and on the same level the entire time. You can move all the way to the end of the space allowed, or you can stop your panorama at any time by tapping the Shutter button again. Move slowly to give the iPhone time to capture everything in the frame. This will help prevent the picture from looking too blurry. Avoid moving the phone up and down while panning for the shot. The iPhone will automatically smooth the edges, but if you move too much there will be a lot of image that gets cropped."
