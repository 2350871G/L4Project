Take the pizza dough out of the tube, and unroll it onto a 15x10x1-inch (38x25x2.5-cm) baking pan that\u2019s been lightly greased with olive oil or cooking spray. Place it in the oven and allow it to bake for 7 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).

When the dough is out of the oven, spread 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of the Buffalo wing sauce over it.

Cook the chicken, garlic salt, pepper, and chili powder in a skillet. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter over medium high heat. Add 2 pounds (960 g) of boneless, skinless chicken breasts that\u2019s been cut into cubes, \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 g) garlic salt, \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 g) pepper, and \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 g) chili powder. Allow the chicken to cook until it is no longer pink, which should take approximately 8 minutes. You can add any seasonings that you like and think will complement the wing sauce to the chicken. Cayenne pepper, cajun seasoning, and crushed red pepper flakes are some options to consider. Add the wing sauce to the skillet and cook for several minutes. When the chicken is cooked, mix the remaining Buffalo wing sauce into the skillet. Lower the heat to medium, and allow the chicken and sauce to cook for another 5 minutes. Make sure to stir the chicken and sauce to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Top the pizza with the chicken mixture, oregano, and remaining cheese. After the chicken and sauce have cooked, spread the chicken mixture over the previous cheese layer. Next, sprinkle the rest of the cheese and \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 g) of dried oregano over the top. Bake the pizza until the cheese melts and the crust browns. Place the baking sheet with the pizza on it in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) for approximately 18 to 20 minutes or until the crust becomes a golden brown and the cheese is fully melted. To mimic the way Buffalo chicken wings are served, add a side of blue cheese dressing and some celery sticks to the pizza when you bring it to the table. Baking Chicken Ranch Pizza Preheat the oven.
