Place the crab legs and claws in a container as they thaw so that they will not drip water inside the refrigerator as the ice melts. If you do not have enough time to thaw the crab legs in the refrigerator, you can thaw them by rinsing them under cold, running water for a few minutes. At the very, make sure that the ice has melted before cooking them."

You only need about 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of water in the stockpot. The water level should be low enough to avoid hitting the bottom of the steamer basket. If you do not have a steamer basket, a metal colander can be used, instead. Just make sure that the colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot without falling into it and that the lid of the pot can still fit on top.

Be careful when removing the crab legs from the steamer. Lift the lid away from your face so that you do not accidentally burn yourself on the hot steam as it bursts out. Steamed crab legs and claws have softened shells, so a crab cracker should not be used to get the meat out. Instead, use sharp kitchen scissors or shears to cut the crab apart at down the center. If serving these to guests, you can completely remove the shell or simply cut a small slit into each one to get the process started.
