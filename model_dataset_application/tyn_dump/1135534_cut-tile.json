If you\u2019re planning on laying your tile in a diagonal pattern (which may require diagonal cuts), measure from corner to corner instead to make sure it will fit the tile cutter. You can typically buy a tile cutter for as little as $15-20 USD. Once you have one of your own, you\u2019ll be able to use it for all future tile cutting tasks, which means it will eventually pay for itself. For maximum versatility, look for a tile cutter with a rotating guide that will allow you to make cuts at different angles. Manual tile cutters work best for ripping standard ceramic and porcelain tiles. For tiles made from natural stone, you\u2019ll need to use a wet saw instead."
