Roughly ten percent of your soap solution will be rosin. Pour the rosin into the castor oil. This will give the solution a pine scent. For example, 90 mL of rosin will be added to 890 milliliters (30.1  fl oz) of castor oil to make 1 L soap solution. Rosin is easily found online.

Make the solution by adding 0.5% NaOH to a given volume of water. You only need to make a small volume of caustic soda solution, as it will only be one to two percent of the total soap solution. In the example of a 1 L solution, you would add 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of caustic soda solution to 890 milliliters (30.1  fl oz) of castor oil and 90 milliliters (3  fl oz) of rosin. To make 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of caustic soda solution you would add 0.1 mg of NaOH to 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of water and warm the water slowly while stirring. When the NaOH has completely dissolved, you will have a clear caustic soda solution that is ready to use. Do not let the caustic soda solution cool before adding it to the soap solution."
