If you use salt, don't season your steaks right before cooking, as this will add moisture which will interfere with the cooking process. If you would like to use wet seasonings, it is best to marinate and refrigerate your steak for a couple of hours. Remember to also allow time for it to be removed from the fridge and reach room temperature before cooking."
