Tie a bow and adjust the loops until they are even and as big as you like. You can try this strategy on any type of chair. The tulle can be as scrunched together or spread out as you like. Play around with the design to figure out which variation is the most aesthetically pleasing to you."

          "description":"Scrunch a long piece of tulle together into a thin rope-like piece, then wrap the center point around the inside of 1 of the top posts of the chair back. Cross the 2 sides of the tulle over each other on the outside of the post, then wrap them around the inside of the post. Continue crossing and wrapping the tulle down to the end of the post at the seat of the chair. Then, tie the 2 sides in a knot on the outside of the post. This method works best on chiavari chairs. Do this to the same side of every chair in the aisle for a beautiful, eye-catching design. The excess tulle should be just long enough to skim the floor. Make sure it is even on every chair."

Wrap it around the back and secure it at the bottom of the chair back on the opposite side with a knot or a piece of ribbon. Let the excess tulle hang down to the floor. Try this on chiavari chairs or other chairs with posts. Tuck a flower into the ribbon for an extra touch of glamour."

Gather both ends of the tulle behind the chair back at the center point between the top and bottom supports. Hot glue the tulle together. Cover the area where the tulle is joined with flowers or a bit of bling, like jeweled ribbon. This variation works best on folding chairs. Choose a color of tulle that contrasts with the color of the chair to make this decoration pop."

Cut 20-30 pieces of tulle that are 18 inches (46 cm) wide and 42 inches (110 cm) long. Find the centerpoint of each strip of tulle and tie it to the ribbon. Then, tie the ribbon to the chair.
