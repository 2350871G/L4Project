          "description":"The steam box can be a wooden box that you construct to hold the wood to be bent, or it can be a piece of PVC or other kind of pipe. The box needs to have a hole through which you can pump in the steam. It also needs an exit hole so the steam pressure doesn't blow up the box. For best results, set up the exit hole so that it's turned toward the ground. This will allow the pressure inside the steam box to push the water out of your box."

You will probably need to clasp down the wood to the form with clamps. You can either make your own wooden clamps or purchase them. Try making some circle offcuts into which you drill an off-centre hole; pass a bolt through that and drill another hole through the side which you use to lever them shut. This makes for an effective clamp."

Different kinds of wood are springier than others and different cuts can withstand more force. It would be a shame to break your wood while you're trying to bend it. Clamp your wood down as soon as you've set it in place. Some prefer to clamp as they form the wood; clamping piecemeal may give you more flexibility and control."
