    "Turn your skirt so that the front is facing you.",
    "Pin the top, gathered edge of the tulle to the waist of your skirt.",
    "Flip your skirt over so that the back is facing you.",
    "Pin the bottom, gathered edge of the tulle to the waist of the skirt as well.",
    "The tulle will fold around the hem of the skirt, sandwiching the skirt inside it.",
    "You want the tulle layer to be the same length as the skirt.",
    "If the tulle is too long, pull it past the waist of the skirt.",
    "Gently fluff out the bottom edge of the tulle so that it's the same length as your skirt's hem.",
    "Baste along the waist and side edges of the skirt using \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances.",
    "Start by sewing along the waist of the skirt, removing the pins as you go.",
    "Next, go to the left side edge of your skirt.",
    "Shift the tulle so that it matches up with the chiffon, then pin it in place.",
    "Baste the layers into place, removing the pins as you go, then repeat for the right side.",
    "Do not fold and sew the skirt in half just yet.",
    "You are simply sewing the layers together to make things easier later on.",
    "Finishing the Skirt Cut some \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) bias tape the same length as the waist.",
    "Measure the waist of your skirt first.",
    "Cut \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) wide bias tape according to that measurement.",
    "The bias tape can be the same color as your skirt, or a contrasting one.",
    "If you can't find a matching color, try making your own bias tape.",
    "If you choose a contrasting one, try matching it to one of the flowers.",
    "Pin and sew the bias tape to the waist.",
    "Open up the bias tape, and slide it over the top edge of your skirt.",
    "Pin it in place, so that the waist part of your skirt is sandwiched inside of it.",
    "Sew along the both edge of the bias tape using a \u215b-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance and a matching thread color.",
    "Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.",
    "Be sure to remove the pins as you sew.",
    "Sew up side of the skirt, leaving 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) slit for the zipper.",
    "Fold the skirt in half, so that the side edges match up.",
    "Make sure that the wrong side is facing out.",
    "Sew along the side edge using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.",
    "Stop when you are 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) from the waist.",
    "Fold the side edges of the waistband and slit down by \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeters).",
    "This will give you a cleaner finish.",
    "Be sure to pin everything in place.",
    "Do not iron the tulle, or it will melt.",
    "Pin an invisible zipper to the slit.",
    "Place an invisible zipper over the slit.",
    "Make sure that the top of the zipper matches up with the waistband of the skirt.",
    "Check the slit from the inside of the skirt, and make sure that the zipper is not visible.",
    "Even though invisible zippers won't be visible in the end, try to use a color that matches your skirt.",
    "Don't worry if the bottom of the zipper extends below the slit.",
    "Iron the zipper flat first.",
    "This will help it lay better.",
    "Sew the zipper into place.",
    "Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.",
    "When you reach bottom of the slit, backstitch a few times across the zipper.",
    "This will help keep everything in place.",
    "Add the finishing touches.",
    "Use a sharp pair of scissors to trim off any loose threads.",
    "Cut off the excess zipper above the waistband.",
    "Turn the skirt inside out, and give it a shake to fluff everything out."
