  "text":" Preparation Peel the onion. Chop into fine pieces. Peel the potato. Cut into small cubes about 1cm/ 1/2 inch in size. Peel the carrots. Slice thinly. Grease or line the pudding basin.  Making the Filling Pour the vegetable oil into the frying pan or skillet. Fry the onion for about 5 minutes, over low heat. Stir frequently. Add the potato, carrot and mushrooms. Place a lid or cover over the pan and fry gently. Fry for about 10-15 minutes, checking occasionally and stirring to prevent sticking. Season. Add the soy sauce/tamari and water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside to cool.  Making the Case Tip the flour for the case into the mixing bowl. Add a pinch of salt. Add the butter. Rub it through the flour using your fingertips. The mixture is ready when it looks like fine breadcrumbs. Add water to make a dough. Add in small, gradual amounts and mix through until it forms a soft and pliable dough. Place the dough on a floured board or surface. Knead lightly. Roll out two-thirds of the dough. It needs to fit the pudding basin. Pick it up carefully and line the basin with it, covering as much as possible. Press down well. If there are any tears, gently smooth them together and rejoin. Roll out the remaining dough. This will form the top of the pudding. Adding the Filling Tip or spoon the vegetable filling into the pudding basin.  Press the last rolled-out dough over the top of the pudding. Smooth at the edges to join it to the rest of the pudding dough. Trim off any excess around the edges. Prick the top of the pudding with a fork.  Cover the pudding with pleated greaseproof paper. Cover again with a piece of kitchen foil. Smooth down and tuck over the basin's edges to keep the two cover pieces firmly in place. Tie string around the edges of the basin. Capture the foil cover to help it stay down. Steaming the Vegetable Pudding Cut a length of string to go around the bowl and up the sides. Slip this around the bowl when adding it to the steaming set-up, to enable easy lifting of the bowl. Place the pudding basin inside the large saucepan or pot. Pour boiling water into the outer pan to fill halfway up the sides of the pudding basin. Place the saucepan on the heat. Bring to the boil then reduce to a simmer. Allow to steam gently for 1 1/2 hours. Check to see if the water needs topping up every quarter hour or so. If it needs more, always add boiling water. Take care not to get scalded by the steam. Serving the Steamed Vegetable Pudding Remove from the steaming set-up. Use the string to help lift it out. It is a good idea to wear oven mitts that can be easily manipulated, to avoid steam scalding and heat. Remove the string and covers from the basin. A steamed pudding should await you within. Slip a butter or palette knife around the inner edges of the pudding inside the basin. This will help to loosen the pudding from the sides of the basin. Turn the pudding over onto a serving plate. Try to do this smoothly and carefully. Warm the serving plate before adding the pudding to it. This will help maintain the temperature of the pudding. Serve immediately. Add a few sprigs of parsley and take straight to the table.",
