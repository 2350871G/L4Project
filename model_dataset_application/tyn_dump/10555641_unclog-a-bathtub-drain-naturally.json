Twist the screw counterclockwise until you are able to pull the stopper out of the shaft. Use a paper towel to wipe away any debris around the drain and stopper. If your drain doesn\u2019t have a stopper, it might have a plug or a metal cover. Pull these out by hand to remove them, then clean them off as usual."

          "description":"Get a plunger with a bell-shaped rubber cup on the end. Position the cup over the drain, then fill the tub with hot water until the cup is submerged. This allows the plunger to create an airtight seal over the drain and generate plenty of force to knock the clog loose. If your tub has an overflow drain, cover it with a wet towel. It is usually a round, metal plate underneath the faucet. It lets air escape, making plunging less effective."

After a few tries, remove the plunger to see if the water drains without a problem. If the plunger slips off the drain, stop and set it in place again. Keep it firmly attached to the tub floor to maintain the airtight seal over the drain."

Bend the end of the hanger into a hook about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide, still capable of fitting down the drain. For an easier time reaching the clog, purchase a drain-clearing tool. Look for a drain snake or cable auger at a general or hardware store. For tougher, deeper clogs, try an electric version."

Use the end of the hook to latch onto the clog and lift it back out of the drain. To knock soap gunk off the pipe walls, rotate the hook clockwise. Let it cut through the caked-on material. You may need to use the hook a few times to retrieve all of the clog. Pull the hook up slowly each time and wipe it clean with a paper towel."
