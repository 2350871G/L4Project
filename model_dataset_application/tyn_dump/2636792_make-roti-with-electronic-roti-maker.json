          "description":"Use 2 cups (250 grams) of bread flour and 1 teaspoon (5.6 grams) of salt. Measure the ingredients into the same bowl, and then use a fork to combine them. If you don\u2019t have bread flour, you could also use all-purpose flour."

        },
        {
          "headline":"Pour the water into the bowl, and mix everything together by hand.",
          "description":"Use 1 and \u20443 cup (237 and 79 mL) of water for the roti. Scrape the sides of the bowl with your fingers as you mix everything to make sure all the flour is incorporated into the dough. Keep mixing the dough until there are no more pockets of dry flour. Make sure to wash your hands before you start mixing the dough, and take off any rings so they don\u2019t get messy from the dough. The dough for an electronic roti maker will be wetter than traditional roti dough. The excessive wetness makes the dough easier to press down in the roti maker, which will give you a more consistent roti."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Knead the dough for about 5 minutes.",
          "description":"Keep the dough in the bowl, and continue to scrape around the sides as you work if pieces of dough come loose from the main ball. Pick the dough up, throw it back down, and press into it with your palms to really ensure everything is mixed together. This process knocks out air bubbles and distributes the ingredients evenly throughout the dough, which will give you a lighter, fluffier roti. Traditional roti bread would become smooth as you kneaded it, but this dough will remain sticky and wet. Your fingers will get clumpy from the dough, and it won\u2019t have a smooth exterior when you\u2019re done."

          "description":"Wet a paper towel, wring it out so it\u2019s not dripping wet, and lay it over the dough. Set a timer for 30 minutes, and let the dough rest. The moisture from the paper towel keeps the dough from getting hard or forming crusty areas."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Divide the dough into 18 equal sections after it has finished resting.",
          "description":"Lightly sprinkle about 1 teaspoon (3.3 grams) of flour over the dough to make it easier to work with. Pinch golfball-sized sections off of the big ball of dough, and set each section on a plate dusted with flour. The flour dusting on the plate isn\u2019t necessary if you think the dough won\u2019t stick to the plate."

If your roti maker comes with slip-free feet, you don\u2019t need to worry about setting it on top of anything else. Always use a clean roti maker.
