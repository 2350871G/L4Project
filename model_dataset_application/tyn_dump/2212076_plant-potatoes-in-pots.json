Some \u201ctable stock\u201d potatoes can also be used for planting purposes, but they do not usually produce a strong crop. You can buy seed potatoes at your local gardening store. Purchase them 2-4 weeks in advance of when you'd like to plant them. This is the standard amount of time that it'll take for the potatoes to sprout. Avoid using the potatoes you buy at the grocery store as seed potatoes. These potatoes are often treated to prevent producing shoots so that they last longer on shelves. Take your seed potatoes out of their bag as soon as possible after you've purchased them. Leaving them in the bag can prompt fungal growth."

A potato \u201ceye\u201d is essentially a sprout. You'll see a tiny green or whitish growth coming out of the potato's skin. Once your potatoes begin to sprout, don't rotate them. You want the majority of the sprouts to develop on the upward facing side. The ideal temperature for sprouting seed potatoes is around 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C)."

When you are ready to plant, identify the 3 strongest eyes and rub the rest off with your finger or dig them out with a sharp knife. If you choose to remove the sprouts with a knife, try to keep the cut as shallow as possible. Just cut away the sprout itself and a thin layer of the potato's skin. The eyes should be between .25 to .5 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) when you begin the trimming and planting process."

If you chose to plant more than 6 potatoes per pot, then you'll need to go even larger. The ample space gives your potatoes room to grow and develop roots and tubers.

If you go with a heavier plastic pot, make sure to put it on a dolly. The dolly will make it possible for you to move your potatoes around as needed for watering. If you live in a warm area, avoid using black or dark colored pots. These can attract too much sunlight and overheat your crop. Wash out your pots using warm water and soap before you plant in them. This helps to kill off any harmful bacteria. Only select a pot that has drainage holes in the bottom. Otherwise, you can use a drill to create 2-3 holes for drainage."

A sheet or small roll of fiberglass can be purchased at your local gardening center or hardware store. Plastic window screening also works as a substitute material. The screen slows down the drainage process, allowing your potatoes to fully absorb all of the nutrients from the water and soil.

    "These potatoes usually tolerate winter temperatures and frost better than early varieties.",
    "Fill your pot with 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of your growing medium.",
    "The entire bottom of the pot should be covered.",
    "Lightly pat the soil down with your hands to make sure that it is firmly packed.",
    "If the soil is not solid enough, the potatoes will sink to the very bottom of the pot.",
    "Both the fiberglass screen and the pebble/stone layer should be fully covered and no longer visible after you add the soil.",
    "Mix in organic fertilizer, as directed on the package.",
    "Use a scoop or spade to lightly sprinkle granular organic fertilizer on top of the first soil layer in the pot.",
    "The amount that you use will depend on the type of fertilizer that you buy and the size of your pot.",
    "Read the instructions on the fertilizer's package carefully and follow them directly.",
    "Choose a fertilizer that is explicitly for container planting.",
    "An organic or vegetable-specific blend is even better.",
    "Once your potatoes are established, you'll want to feed them liquid fertilizer as often as every 2 weeks.",
    "Again, reference the fertilizer's package for instructions.",
    "Place your seed potatoes in the soil with the eyes facing upward.",
    "Space the tubers at least 6 inches (15 cm) apart.",
    "Ensure that they are not touching one another or the edge of the pot.",
    "Do not overcrowd each pot by planting more than the recommended amount of seed potatoes.",
    "When the potatoes are in position, press them gently into the soil and fertilizer mix.",
    "It's likely that your seed potatoes will have eyes all over their skin, so just position the side with the most eyes facing upwards.",
    "Cover your tubers with 6 inches (15 cm) of growing medium.",
    "Use a spade to gently add more soil into the pot, creating an even layer.",
    "When you are finished, your seed potatoes will be completely hidden.",
    "Use your hands to gently pat down the soil, being careful not to crush your tubers by pressing too hard.",
    "Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to add even more growing medium.",
    "Use your best judgment and fill it up most of the way, but not all the way to the rim.",
    "You will add more soil as the potatoes grow, so account for this as you fill.",
    "Water the soil in the pot until it begins to drain.",
    "Use a watering can or hose to slowly add water to the freshly planted pot.",
    "Try to cover all of the soil's exposed surface as you are watering.",
    "When water starts to flow out of the pot's bottom drainage holes, stop watering.",
    "Potatoes do best with soil that is moist, but not soggy.",
    "Water-logged soil can actually lead to the growth of fungus.",
    "You can add a layer of straw to the top of your soil to keep it moist and shaded throughout the day.",
    "Caring for Your Potatoes Add more growing medium as the plant shoots up.",
    "As a general rule, you only want a maximum of 1 inch (2.5 cm) of each potato shoot exposed.",
    "Check your shoots daily to see if they are starting to emerge too far out of the soil.",
    "Then, simply add more growing medium to the pot.",
    "You'll likely need to repeat this process multiple times during the growing cycle.",
    "The process is similar to mounding potatoes that were planted in the ground.",
    "Water your potatoes when the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil is dry.",
    "There is a quick and simple way to determine when/if you need to water.",
    "Stick a single finger into the soil.",
    "If the soil feels dry, then it is time to water again.",
    "Add water to the pot until it begins to drain out the bottom.",
    "If your potatoes do not get enough water, then they will be undersized or more susceptible to diseases and pests.",
    "In warmer temperatures, this may mean that you'll need to water your potato pots twice a day.",
    "Tailor your watering schedule to the needs of your particular potatoes.",
    "Expose your potatoes to a maximum of 6-8 hours of sunlight each day.",
    "Position your potato pots so that they receive direct sun either in the morning or afternoon.",
    "While potatoes need the sunlight, they do not do well in temperatures over 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C).",
    "This is why it is important that they get ample shade as well.",
    "Your potatoes may be receiving too much sun if the sprouts turn yellow or dry out shortly after shooting out of the dirt.",
    "Harvest your potatoes when their foliage turns yellow.",
    "This is the best sign that your potatoes are ready to dig up.",
    "You can either sift through the container's dirt by hand or dump it out and dig for the potatoes.",
    "Set aside each potato and make sure to wash them carefully before eating or storing.",
    "It's also a good idea to inspect each potato for fungus or mold.",
    "The outer skin should be firm and uniform in color without any white or mushy spots."
