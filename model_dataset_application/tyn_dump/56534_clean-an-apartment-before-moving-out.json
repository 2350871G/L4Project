          "description":"Buy one or two cans of oven sprayable cleaner and read the safety directions carefully, as many oven cleaners require protective equipment (gloves & goggles) and strong ventilation. Place newspaper in front of the oven, slightly underneath the door or drawer, to protect your floor from dripping cleaner. Evenly apply both cans to the inside of the oven, the grates, and the broiler sheets. If you want to avoid the chemicals in oven cleaners, use a dilution of 100g baking soda in 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water and spray onto the surfaces. For a dirtier oven, increase the amount of baking soda so that the solution is more of a paste than a liquid. Leave for one hour, then use an ice scraper to remove the burnt carbon and spray any remaining in the oven. Repeat the process until the oven is completely clean. Make sure the oven is turned off before starting to clean."
