          "description":"Use spackle and a spackle knife to fill in any holes or damage to the walls. Use paintable caulk to fill gaps between walls and trim. Run a thin bead of caulk along all the edges, using a caulk gun and paintable caulk. Remove any excess that smears away from the edge with a damp cloth. This is a critical step because it allows you to paint a crisp line on edges that would otherwise be uneven. Let the caulk dry for at least 20 minutes. It should be very thin in the first place, so it should not even need to be that long. While the caulk is drying, you can do other preparation, such as laying out tarps along the walls you are going to paint."

          "headline":"Clean the surfaces with a damp rag.",
          "description":"Wipe off the trim edges with your cloth to remove any dust. Also go around the room and wipe any baseboards, door trim, window trim and crown molding on the edge that butts up to the wall surface. This will make your finished paint job smoother and a clean surface will help the tape adhere."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use painter's tape to mask off  all trim and edges.",
          "description":"Use the 1 inch (2.5 cm) blue tape made specifically for use with painting. The secret here is to tape slowly and carefully, making sure to press down firmly along the edge of the tape so that it is attached securely. Using regular masking tape can cause the trim paint to pull up and you may be stuck repainting trim. Be sure to thoroughly tape off corners where you will have two different colors next to each other. This includes the edge at the top of the wall if the ceiling will be a different color."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Paint from the center to the edge of the tape with a brush.",
          "description":"Dip your brush into the paint, making sure the paint only goes about halfway up the brush. Use the edge of the paint container to wipe off extra paint that might drip. It's important to paint with strokes that move from the center of the tape out across the edge or with strokes that run totally parallel to the edge of the tape. This will ensure that paint doesn't seep under the tape. You can paint the entire taped off edge before moving on to painting the rest of the wall. If you have a helper, one of you can do the edge painting and then the other can follow behind and paint the large sections of the wall. Work slowly and precisely so that the paint doesn't leak over the far side of the tape or get forced under the edge."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Let the paint dry overnight.",
          "description":"Do not pull the tape off right after painting. Letting the paint dry completely lessens the elasticity of paint build-up along the edges, making it easier for the paint to break right at the tape line. On the flip side, you don't want to wait too long to take the tape off either. After a day or 2, the tape line will have more chance of being uneven because the paint will be too solid and dry."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pull the tape off at an angle so the paint isn't disturbed.",
          "description":"Start at a corner and pull the tape off so that it is at a 90 degree angle from the trim surface. This allows the tape to separate from the paint smoothly, rather than pulling up the edge of the paint as it's pulled off. Ideally, the paint edge will be a perfect line with no bleed through. If you follow the instructions carefully, you will remove the tape and find a beautiful room with perfect edges."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a razor blade to cut areas where the paint and tape won't separate.",
          "description":"If you are having problems with the tape pulling up and stretching the paint, you may have thick areas of paint that need to be cut. Use a razor blade to carefully cut along the edge where the paint is not breaking free. Keep the blade perpendicular to the wall so that you cut a smooth line next to the tape. If you are finding a lot of areas that don't want to come off easily, it's a good idea to just score all the edges in anticipation that they will all be difficult."

    "Load up your brush with a moderate amount of paint.",
    "When painting crisp edges without masking you need to have a controllable amount of paint on the brush all the time.",
    "This means that the tips of the brush should be covered with paint but the majority of the back of the brush should not.",
    "Try to keep the paint on only the first 2/3 of the bristles.",
    "Having a limited amount of paint on the brush will help you avoid drips and will help you avoid flooding the edge with too much paint accidentally.",
    "Practice your painting away from the edge.",
    "If you are not used to painting straight lines, it is important to practice.",
    "Start a practice line out away from the edge so that you can get used to the motion.",
    "Work on painting the straightest and cleanest line you can.",
    "Once you have practiced a few times, be sure to brush over the paint in the area, so that there are not ridges of paint left.",
    "This will ensure that the area won't be noticeable when you paint over it with a roller.",
    "Use repeated short strokes that move in toward the edge gradually.",
    "To make a crisp, clean edge, you need to start your stroke away from the edge.",
    "This allows you to avoid getting an unwanted pool of paint on the edge.",
    "As you move the brush along, gradually move it in towards the edge.",
    "Then, when you are running out of paint on the brush, move it back out from the wall.",
    "You typically only need to move the brush in and out about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) to avoid pooling on the edge.",
    "When you start another stroke, begin just before the previous stroke ended so that the 2 strokes can be blended together.",
    "Paint all the edges using your brush.",
    "Do all your edge painting before using a roller to cover the rest of the walls.",
    "Cover each edge with several inches of paint, so that you don't have to get too close to the edge when you come back over the area with a roller.",
    "As you go, make sure that the paint you apply away from the edge is smooth and not lumpy.",
    "Keeping lumps on the wall while you are painting the edge can cause the final paint job to be lumpy.",
    "Clean up imperfections right away.",
    "If you do have a drip or a smudge, you can easily clean it up right when it happens.",
    "Get a damp rag or paper towel and wipe it off the wall while it is still wet.",
    "Then you can go back over the area to establish your clean line once again.",
    "Paint the walls after you paint the edges.",
    "Once you have your clean edges done, you can focus on the large areas of the walls.",
    "If you made your brushed areas wide enough, you can roll over the edge with your roller, making a seamless paint job."
