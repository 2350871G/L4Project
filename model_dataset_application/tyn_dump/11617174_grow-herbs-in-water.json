Pick young stems that are already at least 6 in (15 cm) long and still growing. Older stems are less likely to sprout roots or even survive in water. If you\u2019re buying herbs, choose carefully. Select quality stems that look long and green. Avoid ones that have been cut short or have begun to decay.
