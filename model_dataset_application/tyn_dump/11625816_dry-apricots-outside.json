          "description":"Only dry the freshest apricots since they\u2019ll produce the best flavor. Avoid picking apricots that are still green or that have bruises because they may taste more bitter than ripe fruit. Lightly squeeze the apricots to make sure they don\u2019t have any soft spots that could affect the flavor. You can dry store-bought or home-grown apricots. If you\u2019re using home-grown apricots, try to pick them fresh off the tree before they fall on the ground so they\u2019re less likely to have bruises. You may also cut off bruised or discolored areas of the fruit with a knife."

Set the fruits on a paper towel or clean cloth and pat them dry so they don\u2019t have any water left on them. If there\u2019s stuck-on dirt or debris, clean it off the apricot skin with a soft-bristled cleaning brush."

Rotate the apricot in your hand to cut all the way around the fruit. Twist the 2 halves of the apricot to separate them before popping the seed out with your knife. You may either use the apricot halves or cut them again into smaller quarters. Use your finger to push the pit out from the fruit. You do not need to remove the apricot skin since it\u2019s edible. Avoid using a knife with a flat edge since you could make the blade dull.Warning: Apricot pots are toxic if ingested, so make sure you remove them completely from the fruits."

Put the apricot pieces into the bowl and leave them to soak for 5 minutes in the solution. Strain the liquid out from the bowl and set the apricots on paper towels to remove the excess liquid. The lemon juice solution preserves the color of the apricots and prevents vitamin and mineral loss. You don\u2019t need to soak the apricots beforehand if you don\u2019t want to."

If the humidity stays below 60%, then the moisture in the apricots will evaporate and dry your fruit. If it\u2019s higher, the apricots will stay moist and could develop rot. Drying apricots works best during mid- or late-summer when temperatures are the highest. If the weather in your area doesn\u2019t meet the minimum requirements, then you need to use your oven or a dehydrator to dry out the apricots."
