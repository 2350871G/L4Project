    "Keep two containers under the outlets.",
    "One for sauce, One for stems/seeds etc.",
    "Add sugar or spices to the sauce if desired.",
    "Stir in well.",
    "Jar Preparation Ensure that the jar lip is smooth, with no chips or cracks.",
    "Sterilize the jars using one of the following methods: Placing them, opening down, in a canner with boiling water.",
    "Allow the jars to boil/steam for around 10 minutes.",
    "Put the empty jars on the rack in the oven, turn it on to 250 degrees, and leave them to heat for 10 minutes.",
    "Put about 1\" of water in each jar and microwave them for 4-5 minutes per jar.",
    "Remove the jars and place them on towels near the colander for filling.",
    "Filling the Jars Place a jar funnel in the opening of a jar.",
    "You can use other methods for filling, but the funnel avoids a lot of mess associated with spoons, pitchers, measuring cups, etc.",
    "Pour or spoon the newly squeezed applesauce into the jars.",
    "Leave \"headroom\" in the jars.",
    "Fill only to the \"shoulder\" of the jar to allow for expansion of the contents while cooking.",
    "Inspect each jar to ensure that the jar lip is clean, with no sauce or bits of pith on it.",
    "Wipe any apple residue off of the lip of the jar  before placing the lid.",
    "Place a new, unused jar lid on the opening with the rubber seal down on the glass.",
    "Hold the jar lid in place with a jar ring.",
    "Snug down the jar ring, but do not over tighten.",
    "The object is to allow steam to escape while cooking, yet have the lid seal when the jar cools.",
    "Cooking Place the rack in the canner.",
    "Place the filled jars, lid end up, on the rack in the canner.",
    "Lower the filled jars into the hot water bath using the rack handles.",
    "Place the lid on the canner and boil for at least 15 minutes for pints, 20 minutes for quarts.",
    "Check canning books for time variances for higher altitudes etc.",
    "This will pasteurize the contents.",
    "Remove the lid of the canner and lift the jars using the rack.",
    "Allow the jars to cool slightly before using the jar tongs to remove them from the canner and placing them on the towel covered countertop.",
    "Allow the jars to cool.",
    "You should hear the jar lids sealing closed with a little \"Plink\" noise when their lid oilcans down due to the cooling air inside the jar creating a vacuum.",
    "Remove the jar rings after the jar has sealed and wipe away any fruit residue from the outside of the jars.",
    "Refrigerate any unsealed jars of applesauce to prevent them going bad quickly.",
    "Eat them as soon as possible or re-boil them with new lids and rings to seal them.Some cooks will flip an unsealed jar upside down (with the lid still on) to put the still warm applesauce up against the lid.",
    "This warms the gasket on the lid and may be enough to cause the jar to seal.",
    "Store sealed jars in a cool, dry place for up to several years.",
    "Cleanup Rinse all utensils carefully.",
    "There's nothing grosser (or more difficult) to remove than year old applesauce on your equipment when you do this again next year.",
    "Use a scrub brush to help you remove all of the apple residue from the colander.",
    "Wash the towels separately from other laundry, as apple residue can leave stains on light clothing.",
    "Clean the counter tops and stove again.",
    "Mop the floor.",
    "Cooked apple quarters have a nasty habit of \"jumping\" to the floor at inopportune times.",
    "Finding them later with your foot can be disconcerting at best."
