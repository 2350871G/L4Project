It's also helpful for you to know the nutrient levels so you know what you need to add to the soil to help the tomato plants thrive. Use a commercial testing kit to collect and test a sample of the soil where you plan to plant your tomatoes. Tomatoes grow best in slightly acidic soil, with the optimum pH level being between 6.2 and 6.8. Soil that falls below 6.0 is too acidic for tomato plants to thrive. An even balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is necessary for your tomato plants to produce lots of healthy fruit. Too much of 1 nutrient can affect the health of your tomato plants."

For soil that has a pH above 6.8, you need to make it more acidic. Mix together equal parts water and cold coffee in a water can and apply it to the soil. For example, if you have a tomato garden that is about 20 square feet (1.9 m), then mix in about .2 pounds (0.091 kg) of eggshells. Turn the soil over and mix it up after you apply the eggshells or coffee mixture. Retest the soil to see if the pH level is between 6.2 and 6.8 before you plant your tomato plants."

Combine the nitrogen source with the top layer of soil and compost by mixing it together with a shovel. Natural sources of nitrogen include alfalfa meal, blood meal, feather meal, and fish meal.
