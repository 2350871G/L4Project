A growing plant will produce tomatoes quicker, but you may have more variety to choose from if you buy seeds. If you purchase a tomato plant, look for one that is a healthy green color with whole leaves untouched by pests. Both BushSteak and Patio Princess tomato plants do well in containers and produce ample fruit. If you are looking for a cherry tomato variety, try the Sweet Baby Girl plant. Some \u2018early\u2019 tomato plants will develop fruit within 45 days of planting. However, it usually takes a healthy plant 80 days to create fruit. If you plant from a seed, then you\u2019ll need to include an additional 20 days for germination and seedling growth."

This leaves plenty of room for you to place the plant and then surround it with additional soil. If you add too much soil initially, you may expose too much of your plant to the sun, which can harm it.
