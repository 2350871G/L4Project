Polyvinyl acetate (PVA) is designed specifically for sheetrock. Latex paint is also an effective primer. Choose a primer that roughly matches the color of your final coat of paint. Approximating the color is fine. If you are using light paint for your second coat, be sure not to use a dark color for your primer."
