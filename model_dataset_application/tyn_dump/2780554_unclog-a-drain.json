Be sure the length of the hook is small enough the fit through the basket strainer, which is the screen designed to catch foreign particles. Push the hooked end down the drain, twist it, and pull it upward. Continue this until you fish out hair and dirt from the drain that is clogged. Remove the basket strainer from below the sink using an adjustable wrench if the snake doesn't fit through its holes. Try not to push the debris further down into the pipe. The goal is to drag out whatever is causing the clog. For 2-bowl sinks, twist the hanger and pull until you feel it hook onto the baffle, which is the part narrower than the rest of the drain. Afterward, wiggle it up and down while twisting to clear the clog."

          "description":"Turn the vacuum to the wet setting so it is safe to vacuum liquids and turn it to its highest suction. Now, hold it over the drain and the force of the vacuum will bring the clog up from the drain and into the vacuum. If this doesn't work, insert the nozzle into the drain as far as possible. Remember not to try this with a machine that is not equipped to handle both dry and wet work. Always cover the vacuum vent with a plastic container or bag to catch particles that are too fine for the filter. If you don't, you risk creating a spray or mess with whatever comes out of the drain. Seal the drain with a plunger head to force the liquid that leaves the drain to go directly into the vacuum. Remove a plunger head from its handle, place it over the sink's hole, and insert your vacuum nozzle through the hole."

Stop when you see water flooding down the drain or hear the clog come free. Never attempt this if you have used a chemical solvent like Draino, as you risk the chemical spraying upward onto your skin. Don't angle the plunger or you risk breaking the seal. Remove the plunger from over the drain after you press down on it 4 or 5 times. Check to see if you brought anything up. If you did, clean it away from the drain; if you didn't, try plunging again."

You can purchase augers up to 100 feet (30 m) in length, although 25 ft (7.6 m) models are ideal for standard house clogs. Buy augers from a hardware store or home improvement retailer.

The overflow plate is located just above the sink drain on the side of the tub and just underneath the tap. It should be fixed to the tub with 2 screws that can be removed using a standard Phillips head screwdriver. After removing the overflow plate, you should have access to the overflow tube, which is the piping that you need to remove the clog from. Insert the snake into the sink drain or overflow tube and twist when you feel resistance. Use about 18 inches (46 cm) of cable from the plumber's auger for sinks and 30 inches (76 cm) of cable for the overflow tube in a bathtub. Once the wire is out, tighten the lock screw. Now, turn the handle clockwise and push the cable forward into the piping. When you feel the snake slow down or catch onto something, turn the handle counterclockwise and pull the auger backward. Continue pushing the cable forward and twisting the snake until you break through the blockage. Retrieve the cable when you have cleared the clog and reattach the trap or overflow plate. Flush the drain and pipe with water. Fill up your sink or bathtub about halfway with hot water. Place your plunger onto the drain and begin pushing up and down to clean the debris. Continue filling the sink or bathtub with hot water until it flushes properly. Trying Commercial Drain Cleaners Find a drain cleaner that is intended for your system.
