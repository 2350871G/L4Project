Pull the tubers apart into 2 to 3 smaller clusters using your fingers. The roots of the plant will separate from each other to stay with their attached tuber. Don't worry if some of the roots tear off, new ones grow quickly. You can also use a clean, sterilized knife to slice through the tubers. Determine the size of your divisions by the size of the pots you are using for your new plants. The root base of the new plant should sit entirely below the soil in the pot and have room to grow before needing transplanting or division. The roots of these plants grow quickly."
