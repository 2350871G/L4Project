Stand at fan height and look down each blade. Do any look warped, cracked, or bent? Check the blade holders, the metal pieces at the base of each blade, and check for any cracks or wear. If you have broken or warped blades or blade holders you should contact your fan's manufacturer for a replacement. Use a yardstick to measure for equal blade height.
