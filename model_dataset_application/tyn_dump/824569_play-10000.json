          "description":"The only numbers that earn you points when you roll just one or two of them are 1 and 5. Rolling a 1 earns 100 points and a 5 earns 50 points. A 3-of-a-kind is worth 100 times the number on the dice, with the exception of 3 ones, which is worth 1,000 points. For each number over 3-of-a-kind that you roll, you earn double the amount. For example, if you rolled the 6 dice and got a 2, 1, 4, 1, 6, 5, your score would be 250 because you rolled 2 ones and one 5. 3 twos is worth 200, 3 threes is worth 300, and so on. 3 ones is the only one that doesn\u2019t follow this rule and is worth the most points at 1,000. If you roll 3 twos you earn 200, 4 twos would be 400, 5 twos is 800, and 6 twos is 1,600 points. You have to roll the 3-of-a-kind all in 1 roll."

For example, if you rolled 2 threes, 2 fives, and 2 sixes, that would be worth 1,500 points. Some people follow the rules of a low straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) being worth 1,250 points, and a high straight (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) earning 50 points.

For example, if you roll as many times as possible during your turn but you\u2019re only able to earn 450 points, this isn\u2019t enough to keep you on the board and you\u2019ll need to start over again next time it\u2019s your turn. Each person will need to earn 750 points when it\u2019s their turn to begin officially scoring. Players only need to earn 750 points on their first turn.

Once you roll dice that don\u2019t amount to any points, your total for that round returns to zero and it\u2019s the next player\u2019s turn.

For example, if you first rolled 3 sixes, you would set aside the sixes that are worth 600 points. Say you rolled the remaining 3 dice and got 1, 5, and 4. This brings your total up to 750 points. You could either keep this score or roll the remaining die to see if you could earn even more points (though this would be very risky). If you set aside 4 dice that earned you points and decide to roll the remaining 2 again, but you get a 4 and a 6, your total score for that turn is 0 because neither of these numbers earn points, and your turn ends.
