  "text":" Attaching D-Rings to a Frame Put the frame face down on a flat work surface with the bottom nearest to you. Lay the frame face up in front of you first so you are sure the bottom of the frame is closest to you. Carefully flip it over so you are looking at the back side. This will ensure the picture frame is oriented correctly as you install the D-rings. Put a sticky felt bump in each of the bottom corners of the picture frame. Put 1 small sticky felt bump in each corner.

Tying on the Wire and Hanging the Frame Select the correct weight of wire for the size of frame you want to hang. Picture frame wire comes in different sizes that can support different weights.

For example, if the frame you want to hang weighs 13 lb (5.9 kg), you could use 15 lb (6.8 kg) picture frame wire. Cut a piece of wire to 10 cm (3.9 in) longer than the width of the frame.
