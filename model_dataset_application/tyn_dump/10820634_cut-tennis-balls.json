          "description":"Set the tennis ball on a surface that\u2019s knife-safe, such as a cutting board. Grip the tennis ball in your non-dominant hand so the rounded edge of the seam faces up. Use your ring finger and pinky to support the back of the ball so it doesn\u2019t roll away. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable holding the ball while you cut it, secure the ball in a vise grip."

          "description":"Hold the knife with your dominant hand so your index finger is along the top edge and pointing toward the blade. Carefully poke the end of your knife in between the seams until it breaks into the center of the ball. Make sure the blade isn\u2019t pointed toward your fingers or you could accidentally cut yourself if the knife slips. You may also use a craft knife, but it may not be as strong as a utility knife."

          "description":"Move your blade up and down to saw through the ball\u2019s rubber. Make a straight horizontal cut parallel to the seams that\u2019s about 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) long. When you\u2019re finished with the cut, pull your knife out of the ball. Don't make your slit any longer or else it could easily fall off of furniture legs."

          "description":"Turn the ball so the slit you cut is vertical when you look at it. Press the tip of the knife \u20444 in (1.9 cm) to the left of the first slit near its midpoint. Make a horizontal cut that crosses the first slit so it forms an X-shape. Once your second slit is 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) long, take your knife out.Tip: If you find it difficult to make one continuous cut, start your knife in the center of the first slit and make a \u20444 in (1.9 cm) perpendicular cut. Then, rotate the ball 180 degrees and make another \u20444 in (1.9 cm) cut that lines up with the other."

Let the ball dry out for about 1 day before putting it on anything. Once the ball doesn't have an odor, it's ready to use."
