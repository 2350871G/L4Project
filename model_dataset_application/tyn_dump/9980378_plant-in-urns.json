          "description":"Gardening urns most often come in sizes that range between 12\u201329 inches (30\u201374 cm) wide and 12\u201324 inches (30\u201361 cm) tall. For this reason, they're best suited for planting showy annuals and perennials that don't put down deep roots. Many popular container species like azaleas, impatiens, and hostas also tend to do well in urns. Dahlia, geraniums, impatiens, and other showy annuals are good for filling urns with bright bursts of color, while hearty perennials like blue star juniper or Creeping Jenny may be a better choice for gardeners with less time to devote to upkeep. No matter what you choose to display in your urn, the most important thing is that the planter be about twice the size of the root system once it reaches maturity. Talk to someone at your local greenhouse or plant nursery or look up information online to find out how big you can expect a particular species to get."

Try pairing 2-3 different offerings to put together your own unique arrangements. In addition to creating a more eye-catching display, combining multiple plants in the same container will help you save precious space in your garden and in smaller containers. A cluster of peach-colored tulips, for example, will stand out in dazzling contrast to a bed of white heliotrope. For best results, stick with plants that have similar soil, water, and sunlight needs, as they\u2019ll all be sharing the same resources."

Grasses like fountain grass, fescue, and bluestem lend decorative urns a textural depth that can be used to balance out the bold colors of annual flowering plants. Plant tall, spiky grasses in the center of the urn to serve as an impressive focal point, and sew cascading species around the perimeter of the planter for a more elegant overflowing effect. Most species of grasses are relatively low-maintenance, but they can compete for resources with your main display pieces, so make sure your arrangements get plenty of water and sunlight throughout the day."

Perennials and other lush species may need as much as 12\u201316 inches (30\u201341 cm). Almost any commercial potting soil should work just fine for housing common garden plants.

The simplest way to overcome this issue is to mix an equal amount of organic material into the soil before potting your plants. Ordinary garden compost, peat moss, or well-rotted manure will generally give you the best results. Consider adding 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of gravel to the bottom of the urn to filter out excess moisture if you\u2019re working with a species that prefers dry, sandy soil."

Be sure to dig deep enough to comfortably accommodate the root structure of the plant.

As an alternative to wood chips or mulch, you could also try sewing a blanket of moss over exposed areas for an extra touch of green.

Shower the surrounding soil with enough water to dampen it, but not leave it soggy or oversaturated. After that, continue watering your plant regularly according to its preferred natural schedule. A good way to determine whether a plant needs water is to bore into the soil with your fingertips. If it feels dry below the surface, it\u2019s probably overdue for a watering. Be careful not to overwater your container plants. An overabundance of moisture can easily weaken plants and lead to wilting, along with more serious complications like fungal infections and root rot."
