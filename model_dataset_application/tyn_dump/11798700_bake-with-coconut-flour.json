This is because coconut flour is very absorbent and if you use all coconut flour, the texture of the food will be grainy.Tip: If you're not comfortable with working out percentages of the flours, choose recipes designed for coconut flour. This way you don't need to determine how much of each flour type to use. For example, if a recipe calls for 3 cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour, use 2/3 cup (74 g) of coconut flour with 2 1/3 cups (280 g) of all-purpose flour. Use a measuring scale instead of measuring cups for accuracy."

If the recipe already called for 2 eggs, you'd use a total of 4 eggs. If you're only adding 1/8 cup (14 g) of coconut flour, beat an egg and add only half of it to the recipe."
