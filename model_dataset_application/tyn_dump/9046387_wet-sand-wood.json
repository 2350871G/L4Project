          "description":"Sanding is taking off a thin layer of finish or wood to smooth it out. Before you dry sand and wet sand, apply lacquer or varnish, depending on your preference. Use a brush or a rag to apply the finish. Make sure you apply enough finish or you\u2019ll sand right through it. The finish that you choose is mostly personal preference. Oil-based varnish, oil-based polyurethane, and water-based polyurethane are common finishes. Most of the time softwoods take three coats and hardwoods take two to three coats of finish."

          "description":"Use an electric sander or hold the sandpaper with your hands. Either way, start with 80 grit sandpaper and progress to 100 grit and then 120 grit. If the wood feels fairly smooth when you rub it, you\u2019re ready to wet sand. Otherwise, continue dry-sanding with 150 and 180 grit. Dry-sanding knocks down the roughness to a point where wet-sanding is most effective. It\u2019s pointless to wet-sand if you don\u2019t dry-sand first. If you use an electric sander, read the operator\u2019s manual carefully and use it with caution. If you sand by hand, use gentle forward and backward motions all the way across the piece."

In a pinch, vacuum the dust off or attach the hose to the blower of the vacuum and blow the dust off. If you have no other option, get a clean rag and dampen it with water. Gently wipe the wood to remove the dust. Be sure to let it dry before you continue."

Wet sandpaper also comes in a much finer (higher numbered) grit, which produces a smoother finish. Sanding sponges are commonly used because they conform to the surface better than sandpaper does. Feel free to use these, but keep in mind they might not have the grit you need."

The lowest grit you should use is 200, but you\u2019ll find up to about 2000 grit. It comes down to how much time you have available and your preference. For example, purchase wet sandpaper that\u2019s 250, 500, 750, and 1000 grit. Start with the lowest, and increase the grit as you go if you want the wood smoother. You may find that the second round of wet-sanding does not seem to make the wood any smoother. In this case, stop after using the 500 grit paper."

If you are in a rush, soak it for at least 15 minutes while you get everything set up. This is not mandatory, because you\u2019ll still dip it in lubricant when you start, but soaking is best when you have the time."
