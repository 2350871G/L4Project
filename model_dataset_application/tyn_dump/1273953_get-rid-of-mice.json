    "Mix 2  tsp (9.9 ml) of peppermint oil and 1  c (240 ml) of water in a spray bottle.",
    "Spray along the pathways and areas where you\u2019ve noticed mice actively going.",
    "The strong scent of the peppermint will deter the mice away from the area.",

    "You can also leave cotton balls soaked with peppermint oil along common mouse pathways for 1 week at a time.",
    "Bring a cat in your home to scare the mice away.",
    "Cats are natural predators of mice, and just having one in your home can scare mice away.",
