You do not need to press over all the open area, as pressing along the edges will create the embossing. With the embossing stylus pen, trace the edges of the shape that are lit by the lightbox. The fine point of the stylus is ideal for small areas, while the larger side is great for large areas. Using the embossing tool to trace around the stencil\u2019s edges will cause the paper to stretch and subsequently achieve the raised, embossed effect."
