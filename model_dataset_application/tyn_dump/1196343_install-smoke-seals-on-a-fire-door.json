Most gasket type smoke seals are self-adhesive, so removing any dust, oil, or other material from the door jamb's surface is essential for proper adhesion. Make a diagonal cut with the bulb edge of the smoke seal at the long end using a utility knife. The angle should be close to 45 degrees, but doesn't have to be perfect, since the material is soft and flexible. Peel the protective tape off the smoke seal, beginning at the end where you've cut the angle in the previous step.
