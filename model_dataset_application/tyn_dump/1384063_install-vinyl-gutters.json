Consider the orientation and the landscape of your home to decide what you want to happen to all the water you're sloping off your roof before you plan for gutters to take it there. You want water to run at least 10 feet (3.0 m) off into the yard away from the foundation of the house if you're going to dump it using downspouts. Is there sufficient room for this in your yard? You also need to make sure there aren't severe slopes or ruts in the ground that angle back into your foundation, which could result in water damage in your basement."

These kits tend to be more expensive, so if you want a more customizable and cheaper project, you'll probably want to buy the parts piecemeal. If you decide to buy piece by piece, plan on buying 10-foot (3.048 m) lengths to cover the vinyl gutter run. If you end up with extra, you can shape it to your needs. It's better to have too much and not have to go back to the store. You'll also need connectors, corners, end caps, and a gutter hanger for every 2 feet (0.6 m) of gutter. You'll need drainpipe, elbows, hangers and outlets for every 30 (9.14 m) to 35 feet (10.67 m) for the downspouts. If you're unsure about which parts to use, talk to a salesman at your home repair store, or consult one of the DIY kits for the parts list and use it as a guide."

          "description":"When you're up there installing, you don't want to have to measure every ten seconds. Before you start, mark the slope angle for the water to run with a chalk line to make the job much easier. Slope the vinyl gutters approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) for every 10 feet (3.048 m) of gutter for short runs of less than 30 feet (9.14 m). Gutters need a slight slope so that water will flow out of them and not create pools of water. Place the highest point in the middle of the run, sloping in either direction by the same amount for longer runs of more than 30 feet (9.14 m). For gutter runs longer than 40 feet (12.2 m), consider sloping the gutters down from each end into a single downspout located at the middle of the run, in essence making a \"reverse slope.\" Consider what will work best with your home before ordering parts and drawing your sketch."
