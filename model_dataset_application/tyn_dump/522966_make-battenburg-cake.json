  "text":" Making the Cake Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF, 200\u00baC, or gas mark 6.  Make the batter. Add the flour, 3 eggs, white sugar, butter, milk, and vanilla in a bowl. Use a whisk to beat everything together until it's smooth. Create the \"pink\" batter. Get another bowl and pour half of the batter into it. Use a drop of pink food coloring in one of the bowls and mix it into that batter bowl. Use extra butter or grease to grease the cake tin. Make a \"barrier\" with the aluminum foil by using a thick layer of it and then placing it down the middle of the pan so that it divides the tin into two equal parts. You may also use two separate rectangular cake tins of the same size. Pour the colored batter into one side of the tin and pour the non-colored batter into the other side.  Bake the cake for 25 to 30 minutes or until it feels \"springy\". Set it aside to cool. Remove from the baking tin. Cut the cake in half to divide the colors from each other. Place one on top of each other and skim/trim the edges so that both of them will be the same size. Measure lengthwise and cut the cakes in half.  Add apricot jam and water to a pot. Heat both ingredients until the jam turns into a liquid. Create the checkerboard effect of the cake. Get a pink cake piece and use a brush to add a little amount of jam on one side of the piece. Get a yellow cake piece and \"glue\" it to the jam side of the pink piece. Secure both cake pieces together gently. Use jam and brush it on both connected pieces. Stack a yellow cake piece on top of the pink piece and then add a pink piece on top of the yellow piece. Brush the entire outside of the cake with more jam.  Measure and cut the marzipan so it's a little bigger or longer than the cake. Use the marzipan as if you're wrapping a present and wrap it around the cake. Secure the ends with jam. Use a knife or scissors to cut off the extra marzipan. Place the finished cake on a plate with the seal down. Place the cake in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before serving.  Serve. Place a sharp serving knife with the cake for ease of cutting slices. It helps to cut the first slice so that guests know the treat that's in store for them when they slice a piece of Battenburg cake. Making Homemade Almond Paste Get a bowl and combine the egg, almond extract, lemon juice, almonds, and confectioners' sugar.  Mix and knead the mixture until it's a smooth paste. If the mixture becomes too dry, add a few drops to 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Half the \"dough\" into two equal parts. Use confectioners' sugar to dust the paste and \"working space\". Roll each paste half to about 1/8 inch or so thick. Finished. ",
