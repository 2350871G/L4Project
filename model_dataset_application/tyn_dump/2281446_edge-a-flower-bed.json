  "text":" Planning and Preparing for the Edging Start by removing existing edging material, if there is any. If there are borders around your flower bed made of plastic, metal, or some other material and you no longer want to use them, pull them carefully out of the ground. Discard this old material.

If there is an existing border, and you want to keep the edging where it is, then you are ready for the next step.

You can use a garden hose, string, or marking paint. Put the hose or other marking material on the ground where you want the actual edge to be. Creating the Edge Use a sharp tool to cut into the dirt and mark the edge. For best results, use a half-moon-shaped edging hand tool on a long handle. If you'd rather not buy a new tool, use a sharp trowel or spade. A long bladed knife (e.g. sharpened dinner knife) is also very effective.

The goal is to create an edge that goes down from the lawn a few inches at a 90 degree angle. Repeat this step all the way along the line you have cut in the soil to mark the edge. Slope the soil in the bed upwards and away from the base of the edge. This will help keep your flower bed maintained. At the same time, it will help to visually define the edge even more. Maintaining the Edge Use shears to trim the grass along the edge. This will give you a very exact edge and improve the look of your flower bed. You will probably have to repeat this step periodically during the growing season if you want to keep the edge perfectly trimmed. You can use a weed whacker or a gas powered edger instead. Spread a 2-3 inch thick layer of mulch from the edge to your flowerbed. This will deter weeds, and keep your edged bed neat.

Over time, your edge may become uneven due to rain, wind, animals, etc. If this happens, use a spade or trowel to cut through any uneven patches and remove the excess dirt. A good time to do this is in the spring at the start of the growing season. Install a new border edging. If desired, you can install a border around the flower bed to keep the edge defined.
