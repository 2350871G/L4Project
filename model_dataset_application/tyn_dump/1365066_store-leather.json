Use wide hangers instead of wire hangers which leave creases in garments and can damage or destroy the items over time. Similar to using wire hangers, using any ribbon loops located inside the clothing items to hang them can disfigure the clothing due to the counterweight of the leather. There is just as much a chance for the loop to pull out of the fabric, resulting in a tear, due to the weight of the garment."
