Hang a bird feeder in your lawn and keep it full of bird feed to naturally control the gypsy moths in your area. Birds that typically feed on gypsy moths are yellow- and black-billed cuckoos, blue jays, orioles, rufous-side towhees, and black-capped chickadees. Black-oil sunflower seeds are a great feed option as they are popular with many types of birds. Most mid- to high-quality bird seeds will come with a list of types of birds that the type of seed attracts."

If you don\u2019t have a fountain, a running hose dripping into a small reservoir will make enough noise to draw birds to your yard\u2014just make sure it has a ledge for the birds to rest on while they drink. You could use a gardening pot or a kitchen saucepan with a diameter of at least 4 inches (10 cm). Elevate the makeshift fountain on a stool, chair, or cinder block.

You'll find these areas by looking for the small caterpillars or yellow and brown egg sacks on trees and rotted wood. Cover the areas with the Bt mixture, but not so much that the mixture drips. Cover the tops and bottoms of leaves with a few sprays. Apply the treatment in the afternoon or evening. Sun degrades Bt, so by waiting until the sun is going down, you can ensure that the Bt is working at its strongest level. The hottest part of the day is usually around 3 pm, so be sure to wait 2-4 hours before applying the treatment.

Always wait at least a week; you don\u2019t want to help the gypsy moths build a resistance to the Bt. Bt will kill all leaf-eating caterpillars, including monarch butterflies. You may need to plant milkweed after the Bt treatment has run its course to attract more monarchs to your yard, if you want them. If you attract monarchs prematurely (before the Bt treatments have finished), you'll end up killing the monarchs too."
