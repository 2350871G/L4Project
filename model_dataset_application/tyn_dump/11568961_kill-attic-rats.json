Also, spot any parts of the attic the rats have been gnawing on. Rats tend to travel back and forth across areas they know are safe, so you can catch them by putting traps in their paths. Rats often chew on wood and insulation, especially along the floor. Also, note any holes in the wall and roof. If any part of your attic is dusty, you may be able to spot tracks left behind by the rats."

          "description":"Place them along the paths the rats take through your attic. While the rats are active, they will stumble upon the traps and eventually end up in them. Try positioning a few traps near openings in the wall, close to where you see tracks or droppings, and behind furniture. For a better chance at catching the rats, set up lots of traps. If you\u2019re only dealing with a handful of rats, you could set out a dozen traps. If you\u2019re dealing with an infestation, set out up to 3 dozen traps. Snap traps are ideal since they are effective and reusable. Position them so they are perpendicular to the wall. Rats often stick close to walls and will have to step on the traps as they scurry around."

          "description":"Forget what you saw in the cartoons. Instead of cheese, get bait like nuts and berries. Roof rats, the species most likely visiting your attic, like plant-based foods. They may also be drawn by bacon and food scraps. Wear gloves when baiting traps so you don\u2019t leave your own tracks on them. Place a little bit of bait on the trap. For example, spread a teaspoon (5 g) of peanut butter or less. Alternatively, place a small piece of dried fruit or a nut in the trap. If you\u2019re baiting a trap with something solid, such as dried fruit, consider trying it to the trap. That way, the rats can\u2019t just pick it up and run away.

If the traps are along their usual routes, they will eventually have to travel past them. You should then see sprung traps with stuck rats. To get rats accustomed to seeing the traps, try placing a few unset traps first. After a couple of days, the rats will feel safe enough to walk on the traps. Set the traps afterward to catch them."

Then, wash your hands and the traps with soap and water. Most traps are reusable, so put them back out if you still have more rats to get rid of. Continue looking for tracks and other signs of rats in your attic. Also, listen for squeaking or scratching coming from the walls."

There are standard wood traps with a metal bar as well as heavy-duty alligator-style traps made from plastic. Both styles can be cleaned and reused. When set correctly, these traps are humane because they kill instantly. Rats can be more than twice as big as mice, so they shrug off traps meant for mice.

After putting on a pair of gloves, you can then take the cage outside to release the rat. Open it at least 3 to 5 mi (4.8 to 8.0 km) away from your home so the rat can\u2019t find its way back. Be sure to release the rat in a wooded area with a lot of hiding spots. If you can, do it in the evening, since rats don\u2019t see well in daylight. Note that rats need warm shelters to survive.

These traps tend to be pretty bulky and expensive compared to other types of traps, so they don\u2019t work as well in tight quarters. Save them for more open areas, placing them along the attic walls with a little bit of bait. Like snap and cage traps, electric traps are reusable and easy to clean.

Once the rat gets stuck, it can\u2019t leave. It may attempt to chew off its foot when it begins to starve. The advantage of a glue trap is that it is easy to place and can be thrown away after use.

For safety, get a tamper-proof bait station to house the bait. Poison traps usually aren\u2019t ideal and may be legally regulated in your area. They can be dangerous to children, pets, and other animals. One downside of poison baits is that they aren\u2019t instantaneous. The rat will live for a while.

Next, look for small holes in the siding and between the roof and the walls. Mark these spots as needed so you can fix them later.

Using a caulk gun, squeeze caulk from the bottle until each gap is completely filled. You can also caulk and cover gaps inside your home for additional protection. For the best result, deal with gaps before you start setting rat traps. Without the gaps, the rats can\u2019t get outside and will be more likely to walk into the traps.
