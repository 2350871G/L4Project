  "text":" Removing and Cleaning the Door Clean the space where you will paint the door. Sweep the floors and make sure any dust and dirt is gone. You don\u2019t want anything sticking to the wet paint and ruining your paint job. Make sure you will be painting in a well-ventilated area. Put drop clothes or cardboard on the floor to protect it from spilled paint. Remove the door from the wall. Have someone help you with this task by holding the door as you remove the hinge pins with a flat screwdriver by pressing up lightly. Then unscrew the hinges with a screwdriver or drill.
