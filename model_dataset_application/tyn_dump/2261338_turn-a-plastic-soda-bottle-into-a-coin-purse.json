It would be best if they are the same color, but you can use different colors if you want to, such as clear and green. A small water bottle or soda bottle will work the best for this. You can also use a 2-liter (67-oz) bottle for a large coin purse. Cut the bottom portion off of each bottle, then discard the top. Most bottles will have a molded line just below the label. Cut \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) above this line. This way, you will have room to clean up the cut edges. You can do this with a pair of scissors or a craft blade. Recycle the top portion of each bottle. Trim the cut edge further to clean up any jaggedness. Use a pair of scissors to cut along the cut edge of each bottle half. Cut all the way down to the molded line. If you need to, use a piece of sandpaper or a nail file to smooth down any jagged edges. Clean the inside of the bottle halves, if needed. Wash the inside of each bottle half with soap and warm water. Rinse them, then dry them with a towel. Be sure to remove any labels or sticker residue. Skip this step if you used water bottles. They won't be sticky like soda bottles. It is better to clean bottles after you cut them. The opening is larger, making it easier to reach inside. Adding the Zipper Punch holes along the cut edges with a thick needle. Find a thick needle or a metal awl. Punch holes about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) apart along the cut edge of each bottle. Make the holes about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from the cut edge. Any needle that is thick and sharp will work the best for this. Consider leather needles, repair needles, or heavy-duty sewing needles. Don't make the holes too far from the cut edge of the bottle, or you won't be able to sew the zipper on. Find a zipper that is long enough to wrap around the bottle. Measure around 1 of the bottle halves with a measuring tape, then go to the fabric store or craft store. Buy a zipper that is at least the same length as your measurement. Remember, it is better to buy a longer zipper; you can always cut it down. If you don't have a measuring tape, wrap a piece of string around the bottle instead, then measure it against a ruler.

Secure the zipper starting from the bottom with sewing pins or pieces of tape. Don't worry about the other side of the zipper for now. The bottom of the zipper tape is where you pull in order to open it. The top of the zipper is where you pull towards in order to close it. You can leave the zipper closed or open for this step, whichever is easier for you. Overlap the ends of the zipper if the zipper is too long. Finish positioning the zipper first.

Choose a thread color that matches the zipper tape; you can also use clear thread. Push thread through the eye of your needle, then tie both ends of the thread together in a knot. This will create a double-strand of thread, which will be stronger than a single-strand. You can use the same needle that you used to punch the holes, or you can use a thinner needle.

When it comes to decorating, less is often more. If you add too many decorations, your coin purse will look cluttered and messy. Instead, choose 1 or 2 decorating methods. Be careful not to cover the zipper teeth, however! Hot glue ribbon to the edges if you want to hide the zipper tape. Find a ribbon wide enough to cover the zipper tape. Hot glue the ribbon around the top edge of each bottle half, just below the zipper teeth. Cut the ends of the ribbon and glue them down. Make sure that you are gluing the ribbon to the outside of the bottles, otherwise it won't cover the zipper tape. Use patterned tape if you don't want to use ribbon.
