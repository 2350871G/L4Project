      "description":"Make sure your fence has aluminum or galvanized steel supports at the bottom. This metal will ensure that your fence stays straight. Wood supports will cause the fence to wave. Steel supports, other than galvanized steel, will rust and deteriorate over time. Choose fencing that is .150 inches (0.4 cm) thick rather than other fencing that is .120 or .135 inches (0.3 cm) thick. This will be more durable and prevent dents. Choose fence hardware that is stainless steel or galvanized steel. You want the hardware to be strong but avoid rust. Choose a long-term fencing company that is likely to last well into the future. Inevitably, vinyl fences require some part replacements over the years. If your brand of vinyl fencing is no longer in production, you will find it difficult to keep your fence sturdy and attractive through the years."

Most of these stores provide vinyl fence without installation, for people who like to do their own home improvement. You should decide what your skill level is before deciding to take on a vinyl fencing project yourself."

Keep in mind that some of these sites put you into contact with vinyl fence dealers from around your area. They will use your email address or phone to contact you after you ask for a quote.

If you make them wider at the top, the fence can get pushed out of the ground during a frost. Fence posts should be placed below frost depth. This depth will depend upon your location; however, you should be exact in your depth to avoid installing fence posts that are no longer steady after cold weather. Do not install fence post sections too tightly. They need some room to move with changes in heat and moisture. If you are unsure of the correct way to install them to avoid warping, get quotes on installation."
