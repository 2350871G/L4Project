If a renter, be sure to consult with the landlord about any plans, especially any involving covering up a breaker box. It may not only break code, but also make it difficult to get to a breaker box in an emergency situation. If a homeowner, be aware that even if alterations do not break code, doing so means that in an emergency firefighters, electricians, or even neighbors may not be able to find the breaker box. If you can cover the breaker box, be aware it may be wise to clearly label where it is anyway. In an emergency, it may need quick access."
