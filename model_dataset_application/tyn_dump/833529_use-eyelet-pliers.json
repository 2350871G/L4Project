Set the material on top of a cutting board or workbench, and line up the end of an awl with the X you drew. Tap the end of your awl with a hammer to punch through the material, and make a hole going through it. You can buy an awl from your local hardware store. If the hole isn\u2019t large enough after the first punch, then try punching it again. If you\u2019re punching through a thin material, such as fabric or paper, you may be able to use scissors to cut the hole out instead of an awl."

If you\u2019re putting an eyelet on a stretchy or knit fabric, place a layer of interfacing between the fabric and the eyelet. That way, the fabric won\u2019t stretch so the eyelet doesn\u2019t fall out.Warning: The cylinder end on the eyelet gets crimped, so it won\u2019t have a clean, smooth finish like the flat side.
