          "description":"Use a tabletop clamp or a vise to hold the chainsaw in place on your work surface. This will prevent the saw from shifting as you sharpen it, and result in a much more consistent and easy sharpening process. Note: If you need to sharpen a chainsaw but don\u2019t have a vise or clamp, you can go without it. Be careful to keep the chainsaw steady as you file it if you can\u2019t secure it in place. If you don\u2019t have a clamp or vise that will keep your chainsaw in place, you can remove the chain and secure that in your vise instead. This will require a little more adjustment but is an easy alternative. You might find it easier to secure the chainsaw upside down on your work surface. There\u2019s no one right way, so find the method that works best for you."

Make sure the chain is tight, but it is still able to move around the saw with a little effort. This stops the chain from moving as you sharpen it. Tip: The adjustment screw will be in different places on different chainsaws. Consult your owner\u2019s manual for the chainsaw if you can\u2019t find it."

Color it in or mark it with a bright permanent marker so you can easily keep track of where you started and prevent you from sharpening the same section twice. As you use the chainsaw, this mark will disappear. Most chainsaws will have their own method of marking a single tooth at which to start sharpening, but this can often be difficult to locate and easy to miss as you sharpen the chain. If you don\u2019t want to mark your chainsaw, look for a unique link in the chain. It might have no teeth, or already be a different color."

Position the line on the file holder at the appropriate angle for your chainsaw, keeping it in line with the rest of the chain as you file. Some chainsaws will have lines etched into the top of each cutter to help guide your file at the appropriate angle. Line your file up so that it is parallel with this etching to set the proper angle. The angle for filing will normally be 25 or 30 degrees, but some may be flatter. Always check the angle needed for your saw before beginning."

To ensure consistency across the sharpness of each cutter, count how many times you file the first cutter and file each subsequent cutter the same number of times. If you\u2019re unsure whether or not the cutter is sharp, feel for a slight burr along the top of the cutter. If this is present, the cutter should be adequately sharpened. Run the file over the burr once to knock it away. If you notice shavings of metal getting caught in the file, simply tap the file on a solid surface to clear it and continue sharpening."

Repeat until you get back to the starting mark you made. These two cutters are referred to as right and left cutters. By alternating them, the chainsaw is more easily able to cut in a straight line without leaning to one side or another. If you file one type of cutter more than another, you will risk throwing the balance of the chainsaw off. Make sure you stay consistent across all cutters."

Set the depth gauge over the chain near your starting point and push it forward until it presses against a raker. The rakers are the bumps along the chain in between each cutter.

While the depth gauge will protect other teeth from being filed, there is nothing to stop the gauge itself from being filed down. Be careful not to file away the gauge, as this can lead to inconsistencies between rakers. To entirely avoid filing the gauge, slide it back while you file over the raker. Check the height of the raker consistently as you file until it lines up with the top of the depth gauge. Once you have filed the raker down, it might have a square top. Use the flat file to very slightly smooth off the edges without filing down the height of the raker any further. A flat file that will work for the rakers should be available at your local hardware store. Unlike the round file, it doesn\u2019t need to be any specific size."
