  "text":" Basic Beef Tapa Slice the beef into thin, pinky-width slices. You want to cut against the grain. To cut against the grain, look at the long horizontal strands that run through the steak and cut perpendicular to them. Don't be afraid to leave a little fat on the beef, it will help it cook later. Mix the vinegar, soy sauce, pepper, and garlic in a bowl. You want to cut the garlic finely into small chunks. Mix your ingredients well. Add the beef to the mixing bowl and massage it with marinade. Take your time to let the beef soak up the mixture, using your fingers to lightly message the meat. Think -- honestly -- about giving a gentle message to a loved one! Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Make sure you create a nice, tight seal around the beef -- it will marinate for a long time. Scents and flavors from the air will mix into your food if you leave it uncovered, changing the flavor of your tapa. Refrigerate your tapa for 1-3 days. If you are in a hurry you can leave it in overnight. However, the longer the beef marinates the better it will taste. Heat a large skillet on medium after the tapa has finished marinating.

If the liquid is gone and you still want to cook the beef, add a tablespoon of oil to the pan to help it fry. Variations Try different types of meat for new tapa recipes. While the most popular tapa is made with beef, there are many variations in Filipino cooking, including:\n\nTapang Usa: Venison\n\nTapang Baboy Ramo: Wild Boar\n\nTapang Kabayo: Horse\nYou can also try pork shoulder or pork belly, or use different cuts of beef, like a roast. Substitute lemon juice for vinegar for a tart Tapa. Usually you need to add some sugar too to cut the sourness a bit, but this recipe gives your tapa a nice sweet & sour flavor. Feel free to mix and match too, using half vinegar and half lemon juice. Add brown sugar for a sweet, molasses-like flavor.

Use 1-2 tablespoons of high heat oil (vegetable, sesame, canola) to fry the meat instead of cooking it with the liquid.

Called Tapsilog because it is a mixture of three foods, Tapa (beef), Sinangag (fried rice), and Itlog (fired egg), this is a classic Filipino breakfast. Crack an egg into the tapa skillet as the beef finishes. You want to add the egg when you only have 2-3 minutes left for the beef to cook. Cook one egg for every person eating. Cook and drain 1 cup of rice. You want to rice to be slightly undercooked. Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil on medium-high heat in a skillet. You want enough oil to coat the rice.
