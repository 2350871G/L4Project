  "text":" Preparing the Dough Add 2 cups (473 mL) of all-purpose flour to a medium-sized bowl. Make a hole in the center of the flour using a spoon or your hands. Add the sugar, salt, olive oil, and yeast to the hole in the flour. Use 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of sugar, \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 mL) of salt, 2 tablespoons (29.6 mL) of olive oil, and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of instant yeast. Stir the ingredients together thoroughly. Knead the dough for five minutes with your hands. As you\u2019re kneading the dough, add 3-4 tablespoons (44.4-59 mL) of lukewarm water to help the dough form into a ball. When you\u2019re finished, the dough should be soft and round. Set the dough in a greased medium-sized bowl. Grease the inside of the bowl with oil. Set the bowl of dough aside on a counter. Cover the bowl with a dish towel to help the dough rise faster. If you don't have a dish towel, use plastic wrap or parchment paper instead. Let the dough rise for two hours. After two hours the dough is ready to use. While you\u2019re waiting, prepare any toppings you want to put on the pizza. Cooking the Pizza Crust Roll out the dough with a rolling pin until it\u2019s \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) thick. Make sure it will fit on the tawa you\u2019re going to use. If it\u2019s too big, tear off some of the dough and roll it out again so it\u2019s smaller. Preheat a tawa on a stovetop over medium heat. Place the tawa directly over the burner you\u2019ll be cooking with. Let the tawa preheat for at least one minute. Cook the dough on the tawa for two to three minutes over medium heat. Make sure the dough is flat and centered on the tawa. Cover the tawa with a lid as you cook the dough. Flip the pizza crust over with a spatula. Turn down the burner on the stovetop to low. The pizza crust will continue to cook over low heat while you add the toppings. Adding the Toppings Spread \u00bd cup (118.3 mL) of pizza sauce on the crust with a spoon. The crust should still be cooking in the tawa on low at this point. Leave \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) of space around the perimeter of the crust with the sauce. Sprinkle \u00bd cup (118.3 mL) of mozzarella cheese over the pizza. Spread the cheese out evenly over the crust. Leave \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) of space around the edge of the crust like you did with the sauce. Add any other toppings you want on the pizza. If you\u2019re adding any vegetables, make sure they\u2019re chopped into small pieces so the pizza is easier to eat. Leave a \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) space around the edge of the crust like you did with the sauce and cheese. Cover the tawa and cook the pizza for six minutes on medium heat. Check on the pizza every two minutes to make sure it\u2019s not burning. When the cheese is melted and the bottom of the pizza crust is golden brown, the pizza is finished. Transfer the pizza to a plate with a spatula and serve. Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the pizza into slices. Wrap leftover pizza slices in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to four days.",
