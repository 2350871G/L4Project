You can buy inserts like this from your local board game/hobby store. You might also make use of tabs to help you easily navigate your binder. Binder tabs can be bought at most office supply stores. You can make your own simple tab by fastening a piece of tape to the front and back of your plastic insert, allowing some extra tape to stick out from your binder.

You can find card catalogs at flea markets, garage sales, eBay, CraigsList, and antique stores, though antique catalogs may be expensive.

You may need to use an online card directory to determine each cards position in a set. Many online set directories will first require you to choose the set category (like Base, Aquapolis, and Jungle) before linking you to the card number directory.

Some card binders are intended for smaller cards, and trying to fit your Pok\u00e9mon cards in these might cause your cards to bend or otherwise deform.

    "Many online set directories will first require you to choose the set category (like Base, Aquapolis, and Jungle) before linking you to the card number directory.",
    "The base set of the first cards released in English do not have a symbol.",
    "You may want to gather these cards together and arrange them according to HP (hit points) or alphabetic order.",
    "Look for \"secret rare\" cards.",
    "Within sets, there are sometimes special cards that have a number higher than the set directory lists.",
    "These are \"secret rare\" cards.",
    "For example, you may see a card that is 63/62.",
    "This is not an error; this means that you have a special card.",
    "Collect promotional cards together.",
    "You'll find that some of your cards only have a card number and no set number.",
    "This indicates that the card is a promotional card, also referred to as a \"promo.\"",
    "These are frequently given as a bonus to players when they purchase a deck.",
    "Although promotional cards have no set number, you can still organize these according to card number or release date.",
    "You'll have to look up this information online, as there are many promo cards, each with a different number and release date.",
    "You should also keep an eye out for \"black star promos.\"",
    "These are extra special cards that are produced specifically for promotional events.",
    "Place cards in your storage container.",
    "Depending on which method of storage you have chosen, this may be a binder, a box-sleeve, or even a card catalog.",
    "Now that your cards are organized by set, you can insert these into your storage container to complete your organization.",
    "If you are using a binder, make sure the card slots are big enough for your Pok\u00e9mon cards.",
    "Some card binders are intended for smaller cards, and trying to fit your Pok\u00e9mon cards in these might cause your cards to bend or otherwise deform.",
    "When organizing your cards by set, trust the set symbols and number, even if the Pok\u00e9mon on the card appears to be the same.",
    "Charizard from the Dragon Frontiers set and Charizard from the Power Keepers set have different numbers, pictures, and abilities.",
    "By Evolution Gather each evolution in a separate stack.",
    "Most Pok\u00e9mon evolve into a stronger form when a certain level is attained or a special item is used.",
    "Go through your Pok\u00e9mon cards and pick out all Pok\u00e9mon that are in the same evolutionary series.",
    "Start with the lowest evolution Pok\u00e9mon and put all higher evolutions together with it.",
    "This will likely create many stacks, depending on the volume of your collection.",
    "While many Pok\u00e9mon evolve, some do not.",
    "All single evolution Pok\u00e9mon can be grouped together.",
    "Organize your evolutionary groups.",
    "Now that your cards are separated by evolution, you should think about how you want to organize these groups.",
    "You might want to alphabetize your evolutions, or you could group these according to type, keeping all like-type evolutions together.",
    "Even if you divide your evolutions into like-type categories, it can still be difficult to easily find evolutions within the type grouping.",
    "To further organize your like-type sets, you might want to alphabetize all evolutions within like-type sets.",
    "Insert your cards into your binder, box, or catalog.",
    "Place your cards into your binder, box-sleeve, or catalog according to your evolutionary organization.",
    "To make sure your cards are easily accessible, you may want to create sections in your binder, use separate boxes, or use different drawers for each category you have organized your evolutions into.",
    "For example, if you are using box-sleeves, you might keep all your fire evolutions together and label the box \"Fire Types.\"",
    "If you've chosen to use a binder, you can create section dividers to keep types separate with tabs.",
    "By National Number Find the national Pok\u00e9dex number.",
    "Even if you aren't a fan of the animated series or the Pok\u00e9mon video games, you probably know that in the Pok\u00e9mon universe trainers have a special device called a Pok\u00e9dex.",
    "The Pok\u00e9dex is a kind of Pok\u00e9mon dictionary, and it lists a number for each Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "You can use this number to organize your Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "In the Pok\u00e9mon TCG, you can sometimes find the national number in the information below the picture of the Pok\u00e9mon card or in the bottom left hand corner of the card.",
    "Some cards will not have the national Pok\u00e9dex number written.",
    "Search online for the national number, if necessary.",
    "An online Pok\u00e9dex exists, as well computer and mobile device apps, and you can use any of these to search for national numbers of the Pok\u00e9mon you are trying to organize.",
    "You might be able to speed the sorting process by writing down each Pok\u00e9mon card you own, looking up the number, and writing the number next to the name.",
    "Separate cards by national number.",
    "Organizing your cards by Pokedex number is especially useful if you are a card collector.",
    "The numbers make referencing your collection simple and straightforward.",
    "However, for active Pok\u00e9mon TCG players, this may not be the best option for deck-building and playing.",
    "Store your cards by national number.",
    "Now that your cards are organized by Pok\u00e9dex number, all you need to do is put your cards in your container/binder in order.",
    "You can group cards you have multiple copies of together, or if using a binder, you may be able to put duplicates into the same card pocket of your plastic insert.",
    "You should be aware that putting several cards in the same plastic pocket in your binder could cause damage to the card.",
    "If the condition of the card is important to you, you should never have more than one card per plastic card pocket in your binder.",
    "You may want to leave space in your container for cards that you know you are missing.",
    "This will make it easier to add any new cards that you get.",
    "By Type Identify cards by type.",
    "The basic Pok\u00e9mon types are: bug, dark, dragon, electric, fairy, fighting, fire, flying, ghost, grass, ground, ice, poison, psychic, rock, steel, and water.",
    "However, there are also special types and hybrids, flying/ice to give one example.",
    "Collect all like-type Pok\u00e9mon in one section apiece.",
    "Organizing by type is one of the more popular ways to organize cards for active players of the Pok\u00e9mon TCG.",
    "This is because you can easily search your collection for useful type combinations.",
    "Arrange your cards within types.",
    "Even after separating your cards by type, if you have many cards it will be difficult to navigate your type groupings without a little more organization.",
    "You should create a sub-category within your type groups.",
    "You can do this by ordering the cards alphabetically or by national number, to name two options.",
    "Archive your cards in a container.",
    "You'll have to decide the order you'll store your sorted Pok\u00e9mon types.",
    "You may want to do this alphabetically, with bug coming first, then dark, then dragon, and so on.",
    "If you are an active player, you may want to have your most used type first, followed by your second most used type, and so on.",
    "By Rarity Group your cards according to rarity.",
    "Organizing cards by rarity is another good method for collectors to use, as it organizes cards by relative financial value.",
    "This will make it easier for you to evaluate the worth of your card collection.",
    "Gather all cards of similar rarity into groups together.",
    "Symbols in the bottom right corner of the card will indicate its rarity.",
    "A circle represents common cards, diamond uncommon, and star rare.",
    "Arrange your rare card groupings.",
    "You might use an alphabetic, national Pok\u00e9dex number, or HP (hit point) system to further organize your rare card groups.",
    "If you are a player and collector, you may find that separating your rare card groupings into type, then arranging types by number or alphabetic order, works best.",
    "Pack away your cards.",
    "You'll probably want to separate binders, boxes, or drawers to keep different rarity groupings separate.",
    "An alternative to this would be to store your cards in your container and then use tabs to create sections for the different varieties of rare card.",
    "Even if you're using box-sleeves, you may want to keep your rare cards on hand so you can show these off to friends and other collectors.",
    "To keep your rare cards visible, you could put your rare cards in a binder that has plastic inserts with pockets for your cards.",
    "To further protect rare cards, you might want to encase each in a special plastic card sleeve intended to keep rare cards pristine.",
    "These protectors will be 2.5 in.",
    "by 3.5 in.",
    "(64mm by 89mm) in size, and can be bought at your local hobby store."
