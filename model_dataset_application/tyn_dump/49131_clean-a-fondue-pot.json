  "text":" Heating the Water Fill the fondue pot with water to the level of the residue. If the residue goes all the way to the top of the pot, fill the water to about an inch below the top. Place the pot on the stove if it\u2019s stovetop-safe. Stainless steel fondue pots are usually stovetop safe, but check the safety directions before putting it on the stove. Some stainless steel pots have glass or ceramic inserts that cannot be heated on a stove. Pour the water into a separate pot or kettle if it\u2019s not stovetop-safe. You\u2019ll be pouring the water back into your fondue pot, so make sure the separate pot isn\u2019t too big and that you can easily pour from it. Heat the water until it starts boiling and remove it from the stove. The amount of time this takes will depend on the amount of water, the thickness of your pot, and how high you turn up your stove. Keep an eye on your water to make sure it doesn\u2019t boil over. Pour the hot water into the fondue pot if you heated it separately. Use an oven mitt or pot holder to protect your hands from the hot metal. Pour slowly so you don\u2019t splash yourself with the scalding water. Soaking the Fondue Pot Sprinkle about a teaspoon of powder dishwasher detergent into the water. Stir it gently with a spoon, but be careful not to slosh the water over the top. Make sure to use dishwasher detergent, which has enzymes that will break down the cheese, rather than dish soap, which does not. Let the pot sit for 30 minutes. This will let the water and dish detergent soak into the cheese or chocolate residue and break down the food particles. Pour out the water in the sink and rinse the pot. The water should be cool at this point, but continue to use caution when pouring. Use cool or lukewarm water to rinse the pot. Removing Remaining Residue Scrub at any remaining cheese or chocolate with a non-abrasive sponge. Any cheese still left at the bottom of the pot should be loose and easy to rub off with a soft sponge. Use a steel scrubber on remaining stains on a stainless steel pot. If any chocolate or caramel residue is being particularly stubborn, rub it gently with a stainless steel scrubber while running it under water. Scrape at chocolate stains on a ceramic pot with a wooden spoon. If the rounded edge isn\u2019t sharp enough to slough off the chocolate or caramel, try using the edge of a square wood block. This will allow you to scrape off the residue without scratching the surface. Dry the pot with a dish towel. Rinse the fondue pot and sponge one last time, then dry it thoroughly with a towel.",
