    "If the dish you use has a microwave-safe lid, cover it with that.",
    "Otherwise, cover the dish with a layer of microwavable plastic wrap.",
    "If your container does not have a microwave-safe lid and you either do not have plastic wrap or are uneasy about putting it in the microwave, you can cover the bowl with a microwavable ceramic or stoneware plate.",
    "Make sure that the plate covers the mouth of the dish completely.",
    "Covering the dish is essential because it allows you to trap steam.",
    "The steam created by the heated water is what will cook the cauliflower florets in this method.",
    "Microwave for 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "Steam the cauliflower in the microwave on high power.",
    "When done, the florets should be tender enough to pierce with a fork but should not be mushy.",
    "Check the cauliflower florets after the first 2 1/2 minutes.",
    "Recover it and continue cooking, if needed, for up to an additional 1 1/2 minutes.",
    "Exercise caution when you remove the lid.",
    "Open the lid away from your face so that the steam does not burn you as it escapes.",
    "Serve warm.",
    "Remove cooked cauliflower from the microwavable dish and transfer it to a serving dish.",
    "Season the florets with salt, pepper, and melted butter, as desired.",
    "There are other ways you can serve steamed cauliflower, as well.",
    "You could drizzle soy sauce over it, sprinkle the florets with Parmesan cheese, or season the cooked florets with spices and herbs like paprika, lemon pepper, or parsley.",
    "Precisely how you enjoy this healthy treat it up to you, so get creative."
