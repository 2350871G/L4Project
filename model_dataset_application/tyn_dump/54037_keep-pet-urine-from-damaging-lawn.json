Diluting the spots with water can help them to fade faster. Another option is to give the entire lawn a watering if there are multiple urine spots on the lawn. Most dogs will go to the bathroom in the same spots in the yard so you may check these areas periodically and water them well if there are urine spots."

This could be located on one side of your yard or in the area where your dog usually goes to the bathroom. Having your dog go on this area will save the rest of your lawn from damage due to urine. You should make this area appear more appealing to your dog by placing greenery like potted hostas or ferns around the perimeter of the area."

Put in fescue and perennial ryegrass, as these are more resistant than other grasses. As well, any diluted urine on these grasses actually act as fertilizer and help them grow. You should avoid Kentucky Bluegrass and Bermuda grass, as these are the most sensitive to urine and will spot easily."

          "description":"Making sure your lawn is healthy and maintained on a daily or weekly basis will help to keep it more resistant to urine damage. You should make sure you use nitrogen fertilizer when you fertilize your lawn, as the nitrogen can help to neutralize the urine. If you notice the urine spot appears green and there is no browning in the area, you should increase the frequency of fertilization (with nitrogen fertilizer) or the amount of fertilizer to mask the urine spots. You should also make sure you water the law on a frequent basis so the grass stays healthy. If you notice the urine spots have turned brown and the grass appears to be dying, you should water the area more frequently to help dilute any salts from the urine that have accumulated in the soil. If the grass eventually dies, consider replacing the dead sod with new grass that is urine-resistant."
