The liquid that comes out of the copper tube before the cooker reaches 177 \u00b0F (80 \u00b0C) contains methanol, which becomes steam at a lower temperature than ethanol. This low-boiling liquid must be discarded. Methanol attacks the optic nerves when consumed. You'll probably have to discard at least two ounces of liquid before the ethanol, which can actually be consumed, begins to emerge. Keep monitoring the temperature and collecting alcohol until the temperature rises above or drops below 177 \u00b0F  (80 \u00b0C). You should be able to collect about 2 gallons (7.6 L) of liquid."
