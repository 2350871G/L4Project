You should store fresh, raw meats in your refrigerator for no more than 2-3 days before freezing them. Your refrigerator\u2019s temperature should be kept at 40 degrees F or below at all times to ensure peak freshness and safety of all foods. Be ready to prepare the meat quickly so it will stay cold until you freeze it. Remove the meat from its store packaging and place it on a cutting board. The packaging from the grocery store is not resistant to vapor or moisture, so just discard it. Freezing the meat in the store packaging may cause it develop freezer burn more quickly.

Do not rinse the meat before freezing. It isn\u2019t necessary, and can cause crystallization on the meat when it freezes. If you want to rinse the meat, do it right before cooking. Wrapping the Meat Place the meat in the center of a large piece of freezer paper or plastic wrap.

It has a plastic or wax coating on one side, which helps keep meat juices from leaking out. Meat markets and grocery stores use this paper to wrap raw meats in. If you can\u2019t find freezer paper, regular wax paper, parchment paper, or even plastic wrap will do. Pad any bones with small pieces of paper towel so they won\u2019t pierce the wrapping.
