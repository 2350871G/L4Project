  "text":" Using Ammonia Place the oven racks in a new trash bag with 2 cups (0.50  qt) of ammonia. It\u2019s best to choose a heavy-duty bag, to prevent rips and leaks, that\u2019s large enough to hold the racks. It\u2019s actually the fumes from the ammonia, not the liquid itself, that clean the racks, so you don\u2019t need more than 2 cups (0.50  qt). Seal the bag and let it sit outside overnight. Use tape or rubber bands to seal it securely and keep the fumes contained. Place the bag outside or in a garage or shed overnight, rather than keeping it in your home.

Put on gloves and make sure you open the bag outside or in a well-ventilated area. Remove the racks and place them in the sink or tub.

Use hot water to rinse the gunk and ammonia off the racks. Dry them with a clean towel, then put them back in your oven. Soaking Racks in the Tub Set the racks on top of 6-8 dryer sheets in the tub. Spread 6-8 dryer sheets out along the bottom of your bathtub, then place the oven racks on top of them. The anti-static properties in dryer sheets help remove the baked-on gunk from the metal racks. You can do this one at a time or do all the racks at once. Cover the racks with hot water and add \u20444 cup (59 ml) of dish soap. Plug the tub and let the hot water run. Squirt in \u20444 cup (59 ml) of your everyday dish soap and agitate the water. Turn off the water when the racks are covered by several inches of water. Let the racks soak overnight.
