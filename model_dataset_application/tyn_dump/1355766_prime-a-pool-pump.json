While the pool has been covered for the offseason, the water in the pump and lines may have evaporated or drained off. When you prime the pump, you add water to it and bleed off the air in the lines. Prime your pump anytime your pool sits for 1-2 months. Turn the pump off. The pump should have an off switch somewhere on it. Flip the switch to turn it off.
