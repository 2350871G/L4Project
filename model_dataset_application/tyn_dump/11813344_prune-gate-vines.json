If your vines tend to flower in the summer or autumn months, set aside time in early spring to cut them back. Certain vines, like honeysuckle or wisteria, grow faster than others, so you may need to prune regularly if you have certain vines on your gate or fence. For example, American bittersweet vines need to be pruned in late winter, while bougainvilleas need to be pruned throughout the year."

Repeat this process along each individual vine until the plant is no longer tangled and overgrown. If your vines still look a little worse for wear, consider cutting off an additional 2 ft (61 cm). This process works well for vines like star jasmine. Use your best judgment while you prune. If your vines aren\u2019t that bulky, you may not need to cut off as much."

Repeat this cutting and trimming process as needed until all of your vines are pruned to an even, consistent length. If your woody vine is more than 2 in (5.1 cm), you may want to use lopping shears.

During the growing season, check on your plants to see if they\u2019re bushy and overgrown or if they look trimmed and manageable. If your vines look a bit worse for wear, use a rotary lawn mower or pair of handheld shears to trim them by at least 4 in (10 cm). Try cutting the vines at around a 45-degree angle so the ends of the vines can heal more quickly. Try to cut the same amount off each vine so the vegetation all looks uniform. Make sure your shears are sharp, or else your final pruning job might look sloppy. Avoid trimming wisterias in the off-season, as they tend to grow back pretty rapidly."

Use your shears or loppers to remove any offshoots, leaving only vines that are ascending or descending in your desired direction. You can prune your vines so they\u2018re facing vertically or horizontally, depending on the type of plant or gate that you have. For instance, if you have star jasmine growing on your gate or fence, you probably want to keep your vines growing in a long, vertical direction.
