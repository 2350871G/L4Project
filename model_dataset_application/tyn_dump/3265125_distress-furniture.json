Choose a paint color that matches the aesthetic in the rest of your room. Chalky paint is not the same as chalkboard paint. Chalkboard paint is meant to be written on with chalk after it dries, while chalky paint just has an ultra-matte finish. You can buy chalky paint from any painting supply store."

Lightly tap your furniture with the end of a chisel or hammer to make indents in the surface. Make the marks random so it doesn\u2019t look like an intentional pattern.

Use 120-grit sandpaper to rub the dry paint off of the surface to expose the wood or laminate underneath. Apply light pressure so you don\u2019t accidentally remove more than you want. Add more distress marks where your furniture touches the floor so it looks like it\u2019s been scratched up after moving around a lot.
