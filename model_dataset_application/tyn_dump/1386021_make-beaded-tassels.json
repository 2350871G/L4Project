Keep this in mind especially if you intend to add the tassels to a piece of jewelry, like a pair of earrings. When deciding how many trailers, also consider the size and type of beads you will be adding. The number of trailers not only affects the weight of the tassel, but also the bulk. For bookmarks, keychains, or necklaces you may want to go bold with large beads. But for earrings, smaller beads are better so they don't hurt your ears. A thin-tasseled earring might only have 5 or 6 trailers, while a keychain might have up to 20. It\u2019s helpful to sketch out your pattern on paper so you can visualize what the final piece will look like."

          "description":"Beads are made in many different sizes, colors, and materials. Depending on what you want to do with your tassel, you can choose any combination of beads that suits your style and purpose. Usually larger, decorative beads are used on the bottom of the tassel trailers and on the body of the tassel. Small, simple beads called \"seed beads\" are great for use as fillers and spacers. Play around with different sizes and shapes until you find a design you love. Metal beads will be heavier than wooden or plastic beads, so keep the size and weight of the beads in the mind as you decide which to use."

          "description":"The trailers are the individual strings on the tassel that make up the tassel's \"skirt.\" They can be any length you want, but you need to make sure to cut the thread about 3 inches (7.6 cm) longer than the length of the finished skirt. To cut your thread, lay the line out alongside a ruler or measuring tape and make equal cuts until you have made enough trailers. The extra length will make it easier to tie the starting and ending knots and to attach the trailers together in forming the tassel skirt. For earrings, you probably want to cut no more than 6 inches (15 cm) of thread, for a finished skirt that is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. For keychains, bookmarks, or other jewelry, decide what is comfortable for you to carry or wear and measure based on that."

          "description":"Stopper knots are larger knots at the end of a line that will keep the beads from falling off. You can either tie a specific stopper knot, or just make a couple knots on top of each other to form a single knot big enough to keep your beads from slipping off the thread. The knot just needs to be bigger in diameter than the hole of your bottom bead. Tie the knot as close to the end of the thread as you, leaving just about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) tail at the end. If you find it's difficult to tie the knot that close to the end of the line, you can leave a little longer tail and just trim it at the end."

          "headline":"Thread the open end of the first trailer through a beading needle.",
          "description":"If you have a steady hand or are using larger beads, you can skip this step. Threading the line through a beading needle is to help you work quickly and efficiently without losing the end of the line or struggling to feed the line through each bead. If you're having a hard time threading the needle, try folding it at the end and pushing the folded loop through the needle's eye. The fold will stiffen the thread, making it easier to push through the eye of the needle. You can also wet the end of the thread with your tongue to make it easier to pass it through the eye of the needle. If your needle has a really small eye, try using a needle-threader\u2013they're available at most craft stores."

          "headline":"Slide the beads according to your pattern down the needle and onto the thread.",
          "description":"Holding the needle upright (or the thread if you do not use the needle), slide the beads onto the thread one at a time according to your planned design. Some people like to start with larger starter beads at the bottom and then add smaller beads, but it\u2019s not a necessary step. As long as the knot you made at the bottom is wider than the diameter of the first bead, you can add the beads in any order you want. Leave at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of open thread at the end of the line so that you can tie off the line and secure the beads in place."

Don\u2019t forget to make sure the knot is wider than the last bead so that the beads don\u2019t slip off. If you don't finish off each trailer with a stopper knot, your beads will fall off the line and you'll have to start over. Tie this stopper knot as close as you can to the beads. Ideally, it should be flush against the last bead, so that your row of beads doesn't slide on the trailer."

When you are done, you will have several beaded strings ready to form into a tassel skirt. To easily keep track of how many trailers you've made, lay them out on the side of your workspace as you finish them. Use a piece of tape to stick the completed trailers to the table if you are worried about losing any. This is a good tip if you have a cat or small children that might get curious about your project."
