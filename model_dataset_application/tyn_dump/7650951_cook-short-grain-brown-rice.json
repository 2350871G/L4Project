          "description":"While short-grain rice is meant to be starchier than long-grain rice, running the rice under water will help to get rid of any excess starch that does nothing but add cholesterol. Pour your rice into a rice strainer or fine mesh colander and run water over it for just a few seconds. Usually, you would run water over rice for about 30 seconds, but because short grain rice is meant to be sticky, you do not want to get rid of too much."

          "description":"Add 2 cups (470 ml) of water, 1 teaspoon (5.7 g) of salt, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of unsalted vegetable oil to a heavy-bottomed saucepan, but do not turn on the heat. The salt will let the water get hotter before it reaches a boil, while vegetable oil improves the texture and flavor of the rice. The heavy-bottomed saucepan will cook the rice more evenly. You can use butter instead of vegetable oil for a creamier texture. Generally, you should aim for a 2 to 1 ratio of water to rice. If you want to make more, take the amount of rice you want to make, double it, and add that much water. You should add more salt and butter to the mix in a proportional amount (so if you make twice the amount of rice, add twice the amount of salt and butter)."

          "description":"Lemon juice adds a subtle zest to rice, which greatly improves its flavor if eaten as a side or alone without additions, but it is not needed to cook the rice fully. The starch of short grain rice brings out the citrus flavor more fully than long-grain rice. You can also use the juice of an orange, if you don't like lemon, although it will not produce quite as strong of a citrus flavor. If you do use an orange, add about 2 tbsp (14 g) of orange zest to the rice after cooking."

Fluffing with a fork is better than with a spoon or other utensil as the gaps between prongs allow proper mixing and allow excess water to evaporate.
