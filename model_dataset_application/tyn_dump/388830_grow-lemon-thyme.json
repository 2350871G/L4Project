Avoid planting lemon thyme in areas of stagnant water or where the soil is very compact. Root rot and mold can be particularly damaging to lemon thyme in very humid or damp climates. You can improve soil drainage by mixing bark, wood chips, compost, or pea gravel into the soil. The ideal soil pH for lemon thyme is between 6.5 and 8.5.
