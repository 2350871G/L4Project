Use the torch with your dominant hand to heat the entire steel piece before focusing the flame on the area you want hardened, such as the end of a screwdriver or chisel.

When the steel is a bright cherry-red, about 1,400 \u00b0F (760 \u00b0C), then it\u2019s been heated enough to strengthen the steel. The actual temperature of the steel depends on the carbon content inside. Higher carbon contents will take longer to heat. Another good test for determining when the steel is ready is seeing if a magnet sticks to its surface. If the magnet doesn\u2019t stick, it\u2019s ready to be pulled away from the heat."
