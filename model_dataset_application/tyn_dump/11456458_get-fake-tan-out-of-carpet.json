Instead, pick up as much of the fake tan liquid or cream with a spoon or similar instrument. This process will remove as much of the liquid or cream before you attempt to remove the actual stain. You do not want to rub that excess product into the carpet when trying to clean it. If the fake tan product has been on the carpet for some time, and is therefore dry, you can skip this step."

Use different sections of the cloth, or get a fresh one, if the cloth becomes stained with the fake tan product. When wiping or rubbing the stain, start at the outside and work your way to the middle. This will help prevent the stain from being spread further.

One easy way to remove excess water and soap is to get a clean, dry towel, put it on top of the cleaned area of the carpet, then stand on it.

Do not be surprised if you need to repeat the cleaning process multiple times to completely remove the stain, especially on light-coloured carpets."

Always test a hidden area of your carpet with the hydrogen peroxide mixture to ensure it won\u2019t damage your carpet.

This means that most baby wipes are gentle enough to use on any type or colour of carpet and they are quick. Simply take out a baby wipe and dab at the stain until it\u2019s gone. Use a new baby wipe when the existing one is dirty so you don\u2019t transfer the fake tan product back onto your carpet.

Scrub the Windex covered stain with a clean cloth or towel, using some elbow grease. Use a second clean towel to mop up the rest of the Windex and stain. If the stain doesn\u2019t come out completely on the first try, repeat the process a second time.
