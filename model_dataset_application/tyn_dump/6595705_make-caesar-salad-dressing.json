A small can of anchovy fillets should contain all you need. Get the anchovies packed in oil, then drain well before using them for this dressing. If you don't wish to use anchovy fillets, you could 2 tsp (10 ml) of prepared anchovy paste instead."

          "description":"Place the mashed anchovy mixture in a medium bowl. Add the egg yolk, lemon juice, and mustard, whisking well to combine. Only use egg yolks from pasteurized eggs. There's no heat involved in this recipe, so the yolks won't be cooked."

          "headline":"Gradually whisk in the oil.",
          "description":"Pour a thin stream of olive oil into the mixture, whisking simultaneously. Continue whisking until the dressing becomes thick and glossy. The ingredients should be fully emulsified, forming a consistently thick dressing. If you are unable to pour and whisk simultaneously, add the oil 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time and whisk well after each addition. Adding the oil too quickly can make it difficult to blend into the rest of the ingredients."

You can prepare this dressing 24 hours in advance, but it's best to save and use homemade Caesar dressing within one or two days. Keep it in an airtight container in your refrigerator and whisk slightly before serving."

You should still see pieces of minced garlic in the mixture; you do not need to blend them down into a smooth paste. Note that you should use fresh minced garlic, not dried.

Alternatively, you could stir these ingredients into the dressing instead of pulsing them in with the blender. If desired, you may omit the anchovy paste. The Worcestershire sauce in this recipe will still give the dressing its characteristic deep, salty flavor, but adding the anchovy paste will further emphasize that particular flavor profile.
