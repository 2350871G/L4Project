          "description":"A basic dough can be made by mixing flour, water, and salt together in a large bowl with a wooden spoon. Knead the dough and let it rest for about 2 hours. When it is ready, cut it up into small chunks. You can drop the dough balls directly into the water or roll them out to turn them into wrappers for Chinese dumplings. You may also be able to buy fresh, uncooked dumplings. Ask around at local restaurants that serve fresh dumplings."

          "description":"Chinese dumplings are often filled with mixtures of meat and vegetables. For example, cook up a pork and cabbage filling using ground pork, napa cabbage, soy sauce, and herbs and spices. Place a small amount of filling in the center of the wrapper, then fold the wrapper over on itself. Add different ingredients to customize the filling. For instance, you can make a filling out of pork and cabbage or out of vegetables."

          "headline":"Freeze dumplings if you aren't cooking them right away.",
          "description":"Avoid leaving the dumplings out at room temperature for more than 30 minutes. To preserve them, place a piece of parchment paper over a baking sheet. Dust the paper with flour or cornstarch, arrange the dumplings in a single layer on the paper, then put the tray in the oven for 30 minutes. Once the dumplings freeze, move them to airtight containers or freezer bags. Freezing is especially important for filled dumplings. The dough will absorb moisture from the filling and fall apart when you cook it."

Stir them in so they don't stick together. Frozen homemade dumplings do not need to be thawed. If you buy preserved dumplings, like the kind from your supermarket freezer aisle, you can usually let them thaw for about 15 minutes as you boil to the water or prepare a dipping sauce. If you have a particularly big pot or small dumplings, you may be able to cook the dumplings in larger batches."

    "Cover the pan again and let the dumplings continue to boil.",
    "Most of the water should evaporate by the time the potstickers are finished.",
    "If there is a little water left, you can uncover the pan and let the water evaporate.",
    "Frozen dumplings may need the extra cooking time.",
    "For fresh potstickers, you may need to use a little more water to get them to finish without burning.",
    "Serve the potstickers with a dipping sauce.",
    "Take the dumplings out of the pan right away so they cannot continue to boil or brown.",
    "Use a slotted spoon to scoop them out and place them on a plate.",
    "Potstickers are often eaten with a dipping sauce, such as a mixture of dark vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil.",
    "The best time to make the dipping sauce is while you wait for the water to boil.",
    "If you make fresh dumplings, you can also do it while waiting for the dough to rise.",
    "Customize the dipping sauce with different ingredients like rice wine vinegar and scallions.",
    "Store leftover potstickers in a resealable container in the refrigerator.",
    "The potstickers will last about 3 days in the refrigerator.",
    "Keep them covered so they don't absorb moisture and fall apart.",
    "Since they can be cooked fast and in small batches, you may not even get a chance to store them before they're all gone, but consider storing the raw dumplings and cooking only what you plan on eating.",
    "They also store well in the freezer.",
    "Lay them out on parchment paper to freeze for 30 minutes, then move them into a resealable bag.",
    "They should last about 3 months."
