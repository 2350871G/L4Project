          "headline":"Confirm that your barbeque has a working thermostat and lid.",
          "description":"Purchase a grill thermometer from a local hardware or big-box store if your grill doesn't have a working thermostat. It should be able to reach and maintain a temperature of around 428 \u00b0F (220 \u00b0C), which provides enough radiant heat to cook the toppings. If temperatures are too low, you will only be cooking the crust from below. If your barbecue doesn't have a lid, you can use an upturned roasting pan instead. Try and use a grill with a large, flat hot-plate. Slotted grills can still cook your pizza, but they're much more likely to make a mess. For wood-fired barbecues or fire pits, you need a fixed frame made of bricks and a hot roasting pan filled with hot coals."

          "headline":"Cover your barbeque with an upturned roasting pan if you have no lid.",
          "description":"Use bricks to create 2 side walls and a back wall. Each should be 2 bricks high. Leave the front and top spaces open. The distance between the 2 side walls should be small enough that the roasting pan sits firmly and safely on top of them. The pizza is cooked by placing it into the space inside the \"walls\" and placing the roasting pan on top to radiate heat down onto the pizza. Practice utmost care with this method to avoid burns. Remove the roasting pan when the pizza is cooked to access the pizza. If it's browning too quickly on top, remove it from underneath the pan."

          "headline":"Place bricks around the barbeque to provide a more even heating.",
          "description":"If you'd like, you can place clean bricks around the barbecue before preheating to simulate a baker's oven. It will take more time to preheat adequately using bricks, but the heat will be more even and appropriate for cooking pizza. Your bricks should be free of any dirt that could burn and wrapped in tinfoil for maximum security."

If the barbecue is not clean it will smoke the food too much and overpower the flavor of your pizza. If your barbecue has no flat plate (only slotted or bar grills), cook the pizza on a heavy cast iron skillet, a pizza stone, or other heavy-duty and flame-proof flat pieces of cookware."

If you make your own dough, wholemeal flours or fine cornmeal make for a more protein-rich and chewier dough. However, they also take longer to cook through."

Be sure to rotate the dough and flatten it in as many directions as possible to ensure a consistent thickness. Try and create a thin crust \u2013 most barbecue pizzas have thinner crusts and few raw ingredients because they cook from the base up. A barbecue with really good heat control can allow more variations to crust thickness and structure; you'll need to experiment to learn what works best with your own barbecue. You can precook or pre-grill the base in advance and then freeze it. The bases do freeze very well, so try making a batch of them at a time."

          "description":"Use 3 toppings at most. Common pizza toppings include green peppers, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms. You can also use spinach, artichokes, and other less common options. For meats, pepperoni, sausage, and chicken are common. If you want to keep it simple, make a barbecued pizza by briefly cooking your dough on both sides like a pancake. Afterwards, brush it with herb and garlic oil and either eat it as is or wrap it around other foods."

It's best to place meat closer to the edges of the pizza to cook it faster. Use your cooked meat as soon as possible. If you have leftovers, store it in sealed, clean containers on a lower shelf in your fridge at 41 \u00b0F (5 \u00b0C) or lower. Keep all cooked meat separate from ready-to-eat food and raw meats."

Your pizza dough should come off easily without tearing. If it's delicate enough that it tears or looks like it might, keep it on for another 30 seconds and then check it again.

Avoid flooding your pizza with toppings, particularly cheese and different sauces. Cheese caramelizes quickly and melts, so too much may cause the toppings to ooze.

You can also move the pizza to a cooler part of the grill. If your pizza keeps burning even after moving the pizza or removing the barbeque lid, decrease the temperature to around 500 to 550 \u00b0F (260 to 288 \u00b0C)."
