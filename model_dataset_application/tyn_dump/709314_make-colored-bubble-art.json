Outside would be a great idea. If you can't play outside, find a spot inside and cover the floor with newspaper. Keep your clothes clean by putting on an old shirt or an art smock. Cut a water bottle in half and keep the top part with the cap. Punch a hole in the middle of a plastic water bottle with a craft blade. Use the knife to saw around it the bottle to cut it in half. Throw away or recycle the bottom half and keep the top half with the cap. You do not need to remove the label. If the water bottle has grooves on it, use those as a cutting guide. Adult supervision is required for this step. Pull a sock over the cut end of the bottle and secure it with a rubber band. Scrunch a sock over the cut end of the bottle so that it is taut, like a drum. Slip a rubber band over the sock to hold it in place. If you don't have any rubber bands, you can twist a pipe cleaner around the sock and bottle instead. You can also wrap it with duct tape. Place 1 to 2 drops of food coloring onto the drum part of the sock. You can use the same color for both drops, or you can use different colors. If you decide to use different colors, think about how they will mix. For example, purple and orange will make brown, but blue and pink will make purple! If you use 2 different colors, you may get a tie dye effect or a solid color. This depends on how the bubbles come out of the bubble blower. Dip the sock-covered end into a bowl of plain bubble solution. You can use a homemade bubble solution, or you can use a store-bought one. Make sure that the bubble solution is plain and clear; you already added color to the sock. Remove the bottle cap and blow into it to produce a long, bubble snake. Unscrew the bottle cap first. Take a deep breath and exhale into the bubble blower like into a trumpet. When you blow, a long \"snake\" made from foamy bubbles will come out of the sock end of the bubble blower.
