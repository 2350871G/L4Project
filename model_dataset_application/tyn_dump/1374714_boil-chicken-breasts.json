As you rinse the chicken, water droplets splash off of it, causing bacteria to splatter all over your sink, countertops, arms, and clothes. It\u2019s best to avoid washing chicken so that you don\u2019t risk food poisoning. Chicken carries harmful bacteria, like salmonella.

Chop them as small as you like, depending on the dish you\u2019re making. If you\u2019re shredding the chicken, you might not want to chop them too small, as this could make shredding take longer. However, it might be helpful to make your pieces very small if you\u2019re adding them to a salad or wrap. Use a cutting board that\u2019s dedicated to chopping meat to limit the risk of contaminating other foods. Bacteria like salmonella can get stuck onto your chopping board, even if you wash it.
