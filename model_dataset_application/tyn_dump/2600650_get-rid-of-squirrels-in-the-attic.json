Just like with ammonia, it\u2019s best to use this repellent alongside other techniques to increase your chances of success. If you know exactly where the squirrel nest is, you can direct the light toward the nest. In this case, you only need a flashlight to get the job done."

    "This helps reduce the risk of the squirrels squeezing though the holes or gnawing around the gaps to make them bigger.",
    "Since squirrels are rodents, they can squeeze through very small holes.",
    "Additionally, they can gnaw around an existing hole to make it larger.",
    "As with the other repair jobs, you may want to hire a general contractor to take care of this for you.",
    "Put a chimney cap or wire mesh over your chimney.",
    "Measure the perimeter of the top of your chimney, called the crown, as well as the size of your flue.",
    "Purchase a chimney cap or mesh screen that is larger than the flue but smaller than the crown.",
    "Clean the top of your chimney to remove any debris, then fit the chimney cap or mesh over the hole, making sure there are no gaps around it.",
    "Use a drill to screw the chimney cap or mesh screen in place.",
    "This allows the smoke to escape your chimney but prevents squirrels from using your chimney as an entrance to your home.",
    "Make sure you don't leave debris around the chimney, as this could become a fire hazard.",
    "Clean your chimney cap or mesh screen every few months during use, as well as before winter arrives.",
    "Soot buildup can cause damage or may become a hazard.",
    "If you live in the UK,there are rules and regulations for how chimney caps are installed.",
    "Once it's in place, a building inspector will need to check your chimney cap to make sure it's installed correctly.",
    "For this reason, it's best to hire a professional to do it.",
    "Create a one-way exit hole if you think squirrels remain.",
    "Make a funnel out of wire mesh or a thin sheet of metal, then position the large end of the funnel over the final exit hole on the outside of your home.",
    "The narrow end of the tunnel should point toward the outside of your home.",
    "This allows the squirrels to go outside to find food or water but prevents them from re-entering your home.",
    "Ideally, the large end of your funnel should have a diameter of around 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm).",
    "The small end should slightly smaller than the hole the squirrel is using to enter and exit your home.",
    "Make the the length of your tunnel about 12 inches (30 cm) long.",
    "Bait the end of the tunnel if you want to speed up the process.",
    "Put a handful of peanuts, some peanut butter, crackers, or apple slices at the end of the tunnel or just outside of it.",
    "This will entice the squirrel to make its exit quickly.",
    "You don\u2019t need to use bait, as the squirrel will eventually leave to collect more food.",
    "However, using bait can encourage the squirrel to leave your home sooner."
