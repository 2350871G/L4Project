Find a jack that best fits your needs, whether it\u2019s a simple flush plate, a wall mount jack, or a baseboard jack. Jacks come in several different shapes and colors, and you\u2019ll probably want to choose one that blends in well with your room\u2019s d\u00e9cor. If you\u2019re replacing an old jack that needs repairing, the simplest choice is a new jack with the same size and shape as the old one. For example, if your old jack is a standard rectangular wall plate, it will be easiest to install a new jack that looks very similar. This way you won\u2019t have to drill a new hole in your wall to accommodate a new jack size. If you plan to attach your telephone to the wall, make sure you buy a wall mount jack, rather than a flush jack. A wall mount jack juts out from the wall, providing a structure on which to mount your telephone. A flush jack lies flat against the wall, allowing you to plug in your phone, but not mount it. Baseboard jacks are small plastic or metal boxes that are affixed to your baseboard, with the jack opening on the bottom edge of the box. If you\u2019re concerned about aesthetics, this may be a more discreet option than a wall plate. If you\u2019re planning on using the jack for both a DSL internet connection and a phone line, choose a jack with two openings, often called a duplex jack, so that you can run two separate lines."

It\u2019s a gray box that is usually mounted on the outside of your house. When you\u2019re ready to install your new jack, it\u2019s important to disconnect your phone line so you aren\u2019t working with a live wire. The electrical current that runs through phone lines is not strong, but it could still give you a small shock if you aren\u2019t careful. The NID has two sides: one for the phone company, and one for customers. Open the side that\u2019s intended for customers (the phone company\u2019s side is usually locked) and unplug the test jack. Now your phone line is disconnected from the outside network. If you\u2019re working with an older interface box without a test jack, disconnect your phone line by detaching the wires, making sure to remember which wire goes where so you\u2019ll be able to reattach them when your job is complete."

    "Prepare the wires for your new jack.",
    "If you\u2019re replacing a jack that has been around for a long time, the four wires might need to be trimmed and stripped before you attach them to the new jack.",
    "If the exposed parts of the wires look old or brittle, use a wire cutter to trim off the damaged portions, no more than about \u00bd\u201d to \u00be\u201d (1.25 to 2 cm).",
    "Now use the wire cutter or a utility knife to gently strip the insulation from the tips of the wires so they may be connected to the new jack.",
    "Attach the telephone wires to the new jack.",
    "Turn the new jack over and loosen the four screws on the back.",
    "Connect each wire to the correct section of the jack, marked by color; there will be a spot for the red, green, yellow, and black wires.",
    "Secure the wires by tightening each screw.",
    "Mount the jack.",
    "Push the wires into the wall and position the jack over the hole.",
    "Line the jack\u2019s screw holes with the holes made by the old jack.",
    "Place the new screws in the screw holes and use a screwdriver to secure the new jack to the wall.",
    "Depending on the type of jack you have, you may have a cover case that should be secured onto the wall piece to complete the process.",
    "Some types of jacks come with adhesive backing in addition to screws.",
    "You may use this to secure the jack to the wall, but it isn\u2019t strictly necessary.",
    "Reconnect the phone line.",
    "Return to the NID on the outside of your house.",
    "Open the box and plug the test jack back in.",
    "If your NID doesn\u2019t have a test plug, reconnect the wires you previously disconnected, making sure to screw them in securely.",
    "Test your line.",
    "Plug your telephone or DSL cable into your newly installed jack.",
    "Your phone should have a dial tone, and your internet connection should work now (as long as your computer is correctly set up for a DSL connection.",
    "If the phone line does not seem to be working, you may need to unscrew the new jack and make sure the wires are connected to the proper places and correctly screwed in.",
    "If further electrical work is required, make sure to go back to the NID and disconnect the phone line again before manipulating the wires."
