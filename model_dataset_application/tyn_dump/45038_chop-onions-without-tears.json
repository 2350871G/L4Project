If you choose this method, plan out your attack beforehand. Some say to do it under running water, but this is a bit tricky, too, obviously.

Your mouth will water, which will be a little uncomfortable, but your eyes won't! Others say to chew gum. When an onion is cut, a chemical is released into the air. It irritates the lachrymal glands, causing them to excrete tears. Chewing gum while cutting onions prevents tears by forcing you to breathe through your mouth.Chewing gum before, during or after cutting onions promotes production of saliva. Saliva absorbs the vapors emitted by cut onions, preventing them from condensing on the eye and causing tears. It is best to start chewing gum before starting to cut onions, and to remember to breathe through the mouth while cutting the onion."
