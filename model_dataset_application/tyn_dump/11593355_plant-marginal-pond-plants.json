Try pairing a short and a tall plant or 2 plants with different color leaves to add interest to your pond garden. Plan to purchase and plant your aquatic plants between mid-spring and early summer.

You can purchase these types of containers at a plant nursery or garden center. Make sure that the container is big enough to fit all of your plants into it. Do not place more than 3 plants in each container. If you don\u2019t want to submerge the pot, you could also place it in a normal pot and position it on the edges of the pond.Tip: One benefit of growing plants in containers is that they are less likely to spread and become an invasive species in your pond garden. You can also reduce the chances of introducing an invasive species by quarantining any new plants you purchase for 3 weeks before adding them to your pond."
