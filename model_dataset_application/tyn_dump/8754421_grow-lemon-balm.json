However, you can also plant it in later summer when the weather starts to cool. You can also grow lemon balm indoors. Choose a large pot that\u2019s at least 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) deep and wide, and keep it in a location where it will receive significant sun during the day."

          "description":"You can plant lemon balm from seeds or seedlings, which are young plants that have already sprouted stems. In most cases, you\u2019ll have easier time using seedlings, though lemon balm seeds are fairly hardy and usually sprout without much trouble. It typically takes 6 weeks for lemon balm seeds to develop into seedlings. If you or a friend has an existing lemon balm plant, you can harvest a shoot from the plant and place it in a glass of water. Change the water daily, and once the shoot begins to root, you can plant it outdoors or in a container."

          "description":"Lemon balm grows best in a location that receives full sun. However, it is partially shade-tolerant, so it can do well in a spot that receives some shade in the afternoon. Even if you plan to grow the lemon balm outdoors, you may want to plant it in a container. That way, you can easily move it around your yard or deck to find the ideal spot."

Soilless potting mixes, vermiculite, perlite, coco peat, and rockwool are also ideal mediums for growing lemon balm as long as you fertilize them regularly."

          "description":"Lemon balm doesn\u2019t require a lot of fertilizer for healthy growth. However, it\u2019s still a good idea to mix in some slow-release fertilizer into the soil when you plant to ensure that the plants receive a steady supply of nutrients over time. A slow-release fertilizer with a 19-19-19 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is ideal for growing lemon balm. Be sure to read the fertilizer label to determine the proper amount to add to your lemon balm plants and how often you need to reapply it."

Place seeds \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) beneath the soil and seedlings at the same depth that they are in their containers, and space the plants so they\u2019re at least 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm) apart. You may need to thin the seedlings as they grow so there is enough space between the plants."

Opt for an organic mulch, and spread approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) of it around the base of the plants. Organic mulch includes compost, leaves, grass clippings, wood, and bark. You can add mulch to your plants each spring or each fall. Keep an eye on the mulch around the plants. If it\u2019s washed or blown away, you may need to add it more than once a year."

It\u2019s also a good idea to keep healthy leaves trimmed to ensure effective air circulation around the plants.
