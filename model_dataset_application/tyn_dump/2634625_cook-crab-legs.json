The finished crab legs should have a \"cooked odor.\" Serve warm. Remove them from the basket with a tong and serve them warm with a side of melted butter. Baking Defrost the crab legs. Allow them to thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Alternatively, you can also thaw pre-cooked crab legs by running them under cold water for several minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Prepare a shallow baking pan by filling the bottom 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) with hot water.

Just make sure that you place the aluminum foil back on the pan before returning it to the oven. Serve warm. Immediately transfer the warm crab legs to a serving plate and enjoy with melted butter and salt, to taste. Slow-Cooking Thaw and rinse the crab. The best way to defrost crab is to let it sit, covered, inside the refrigerator overnight. Crab legs can also be thawed by running them under cold water for a few minutes. Even if you do not need to run the crab legs under cold water to thaw them, doing so could also help remove any remaining ice crystals or slime. Pat dry with clean paper towels before using. Transfer the crab legs to a slow cooker. Arrange the crab legs in even layers inside the slow cooker and add enough water to just barely cover them. You will need to create multiple layers of crab legs, but these layers should at least be even. Due to the shape of the crab legs, an oval slow cooker usually works better than a round one. You only need enough water to cover the crabs. Too little or too much could be result in crab legs that are too dry or not sufficiently heated. Mix the butter, dill, and garlic. Melt the butter in a small bowl and stir in the garlic powder and dill. If you prefer a stronger garlic taste, you can use 4 cloves of minced garlic instead of concentrated garlic powder. Since the crab legs are being cooked slowly, the flavors of the seasonings have a greater opportunity to permeate the thick shell of the legs and flavor the meat beneath. Add the flavored butter to the crab legs. Pour the melted butter mixture over the crab legs in the slow cooker. Try to spread the butter over as many of the crab legs as possible. You can toss them to coat the crab more thoroughly, but this is not necessary. Cook on high for 4 hours. Cover the slow cooker and cook the crab legs until they are steaming hot and nearly melting inside their shells. It you did not have time to thaw your crab legs and are cooking them straight from a frozen state, add another 30 minutes to the cooking time. Serve hot. Use tongs to remove the crab legs from the slow cooker. Transfer them to a serving platter and enjoy while hot. If desired, you can serve the crab legs with additional melted butter or lemon wedges. Microwaving Defrost the crab legs. The quickest way to thaw crab legs is to place them under cold, running water for several minutes. The recommended thawing method takes much longer.
