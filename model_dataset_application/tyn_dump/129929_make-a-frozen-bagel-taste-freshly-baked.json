If it wasn\u2019t, wrap it in plastic wrap or aluminum foil when you take it out of the freezer to help it retain its moisture level while it\u2019s defrosting. You could also let the bagel defrost overnight, which could especially come in handy if you want to eat a bagel first thing in the morning.Tip: If you\u2019re in a rush or forgot to defrost your bagel, don\u2019t worry!
