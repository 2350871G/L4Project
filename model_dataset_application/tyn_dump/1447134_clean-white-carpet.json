Mix \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 ml) of white vinegar or non-bleach detergent with 1 US quart (0.95 L)of water. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray onto the dried stain. Rub the area with a sponge and blot it dry with paper towels. Alternatively, you can use 1 cup (240 ml) of water with a few drops of clear dish soap to blot the stain.

Use a mild detergent instead of ammonia for a wool or wool-blend carpet. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray onto the dried stain. Rub the area with a sponge and blot it dry with paper towels. Pay attention to clear-colored stains such as white wine. The sugars actually caramelize over time causing discolored patches.

Vacuum up the pieces and blot the area with a towel. For smaller pieces of gum, use a spoon to lift the frozen gum and cut the carpet underneath.

Vacuuming gets rid of any surface dirt on the carpet before it has a chance to get pressed in. Try for once or twice a week at a minimum, but daily is even better, especially if you have children or pets. Use a high-quality vacuum, experts recommend a top-loading machine with HEPA filters to catch the maximum amount of dirt. Remember to the change or clean the filters often. Make sure the filter is completely dry before using the vacuum again. Set the vacuum height level so that it gives slight resistance when you push it over the carpet. This will ensure it is operating optimally. Change the vacuum bag or canister often. When it is above half full the vacuum is less effective."

Leave socks on though, as bare feet give off natural oils that are then deposited on the carpet, causing it to attract dirt. Place a shoe rack by the door to remind you to remove your shoes when you come in. Have slippers, which are strictly for indoor use and don't walk outside in them. You could even have a few spare pairs to offer guests, who may be uncomfortable removing their shoes. If you don\u2019t want to ask guests to remove their shoes, place a mat in the entryway to catch dirt."

This method, also known as steam cleaning, involves pre-spraying the carpet with soap, then applying a fine spray of hot water to rinse the soap. Finally, the wastewater should be extracted so that no soapy film remains on the carpet. It is also beneficial for health reasons as the hot temperatures kill any mold, bacteria, and pollutants stuck in the soft surface of the carpet. As many as one hundred times more pollutants are found indoors than outdoors."

Vacuum before you begin to get the top layer of dirt off as steam-cleaners are designed to wash the carpet and get at the ground-in dirt. Remove furniture and pick up all items lying around the floor. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific device you are using. Most carpet steam cleaners lay the water down when you push the machine forward and extract it when you pull back. If this is the case, be sure to slowly pull the machine over the carpet to extract as much water as possible. Excess water left behind may soak the carpet padding and cause mold or mildew issues. Use in the summer months when you can keep windows open for ventilation and to speed up drying."
