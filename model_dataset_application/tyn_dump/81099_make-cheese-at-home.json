But if you'd like a recipe that involves fermentation, you can make an extra-thick \"yoghurt cheese\" from scratch. To do this, add the following steps to the recipe:\nHeat 1 quart (1 liter) milk to exactly 110\u00baF (43\u00baC) with the help of a cooking thermometer. Avoid UHT or ultra-pastuerized milk for best results. Stir in one packet of yoghurt starter culture, available from cooking supply stores and online cheese-making stores. Alternatively, use 2 tbsp (30mL) plain yoghurt with live active cultures. Instead of draining in the refrigerator as described below, let drain in a yoghurt maker for 12\u201316 hours. This keeps the yoghurt around 100\u00baF (38\u00baC), encouraging bacterial fermentation."

The longer you let the yoghurt drain, the thicker and more complex the cheese will be. Optionally, you can occasionally smooth out the \"cheese\" with a spoon for a creamier texture.
