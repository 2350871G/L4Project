Taste the batter once you have finished to make sure the blend of seasonings is to your liking. Add more salt and pepper if necessary, or a few pinches of cayenne pepper if you prefer spicier akara. You can leave the batter overnight if you want to make it lighter and more frothy. This step is optional, however."
