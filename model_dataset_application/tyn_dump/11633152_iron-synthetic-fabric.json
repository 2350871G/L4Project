If you\u2019re working with a larger length of fabric, just flip the material over. If you iron synthetic materials while they\u2019re right-side-out, you might damage the surface of the fabric.

Use both hands to smooth out any obvious wrinkles and folds in the material, so the fabric looks as flat as possible. If you\u2019re working with a skirt, shirt, or another similar clothing item, arrange the ironing board between both layers of the garment. If your synthetic fabric isn\u2019t smooth on the ironing board, it will be more difficult to iron. If possible, use a padded ironing board."

As you arrange the towel, check that both the edges and surface of the ironing board are completely covered with the buffer cloth. If your towel is small, you can iron your synthetic material in sections. A pillow case can also work as a good buffer cloth. Check the care label instructions on your towel before using it as a buffer. Your buffer item should be able to withstand low iron heat."

Specifically, be on the lookout for the symbol of an iron with 1 to 3 dots along the inside. Most synthetic fabrics will have an iron symbol with 1 dot, which means the material can be ironed at a low, cooler temperature. An iron symbol with 2 dots means that the garment can be ironed with medium heat, while 3 dots represent high heat. Some clothing tags use the numbers 1, 2, and 3 instead of dots.

If your synthetic item is made of acetate, iron the garment while it\u2019s still damp from the washer. If your fabric is made with polyester or nylon, check that the material is mostly dry when you iron it. If the item is made of acrylics, check that it\u2019s fully dry before you iron it.

Next, check that any steam options are disabled, so you can apply an even amount of dry heat. If the material is acrylic, nylon, or polyester, use a spray bottle to dampen the fabric as needed.

As you work, focus on any areas that are especially wrinkled. Try to keep the iron moving constantly, so you don\u2019t burn your synthetic fabric.
