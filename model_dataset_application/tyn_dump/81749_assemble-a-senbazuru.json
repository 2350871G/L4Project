          "description":"Think about how you want the completed senbazuru to look. Do you want large cranes or small? Do you want them all to be the same color or would you prefer to mix the shades of the cranes? Traditionally the cranes are made from a square sheet of paper that is 7.5 centimetres (3.0 in) on each side. However, you can make the cranes as large or as small as you choose, if the paper is square in shape. The cranes can all be the same color, multicolored, or you can use patterned paper."

Bring the top point down to the bottom, while folding the left and right corners into the center. This will bring all four corners of the paper together, and will create a small, flat, diamond shape. The end of the diamond closest to you, where all four corners of the paper come together, should be open. It should also have two flaps on the right and two flaps on the lap.

The more space you want to leave, the longer the length of string you will need to use. Also, remember to leave extra string so that you can hang the strand when it is completed. If you want a much longer strand that will hang almost to the floor, use 2 metres (6.6 ft) or more of the thread. You can make each strand as small as you like, but keep in mind that any string shorter than 0.5 metres (1.6 ft) will not hold many cranes.

Traditionally, there are 25 strands with 40 paper cranes each. You can divide the 1000 paper cranes any way that you wish, depending on how long you want each strand to be. With 40 cranes on a strand, use 1 metre (3.3 ft) of thread. If you are only putting 20 cranes per strand, use about 0.5 metres (1.6 ft) of string. If you want 10 strands of 100 cranes, you will need about 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) of string or wire. Cut a long length of thread according to your desired strand length. Usually, each strand is about 1 metre (3.3 ft) long. The length depends on how much space you want between each crane. The more space you want to leave, the longer the length of string you will need to use. Also, remember to leave extra string so that you can hang the strand when it is completed. If you want a much longer strand that will hang almost to the floor, use 2 metres (6.6 ft) or more of the thread. You can make each strand as small as you like, but keep in mind that any string shorter than 0.5 metres (1.6 ft) will not hold many cranes. Line up 40 paper cranes (or the number of cranes you are using per strand) and measure the thread or wire against them. This way you will ensure that there is enough thread or wire to string all the cranes. Thread your sewing needle. Place the end of the string or wire through the eye of the needle so that at least 6 inches (15 cm) have passed through the eye. You will use this extra string to hang the strand. If you are using string, it may be easier if you slightly dampen the end before threading the needle. Tie a bead at the bottom of the thread. To prevent the bead from falling off the string, tie a loose knot at the end of the string that is furthest away from the needle. Then pull the needle and thread through the bead, until it is at the end of your string. Push the needle through the middle of the body of the crane up to the top. The crane is now on the string; simply slide it down so that it is next to the bead. Add another bead to the string if you're using spacers. Pull the needle and thread (or wire) through the hole in the spacer bead. Then slide the spacer bead so that it is next to the crane. Spacer beads are not necessary, but many people find them helpful to prevent the cranes from bunching. Repeat the threading process for each paper crane. If you are using 40 paper cranes per strand, you will repeat these steps 40 times until each crane is on the string. Finishing the Senbazuru Cut off any excess string or wire. Leave a minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) of string to hang the strand. If there is more than this at the top of your strand, use the scissors or shears to trim the excess. If you want your senbazuru to hang longer, you can leave more string at the top. It depends on how long you want the finished product to be. Finish each strand with a bead or charm. When you have strung all the cranes on each strand, you will need to finish it. Add a bead or charm to the top. Loop the thread through the bead, and then tie a knot above the bead. This will prevent the bead, and the cranes, from sliding off the end of the strand. Tie a loose knot or loop at the top of the strand. Hang the strand from a hook, nail, chair, or doorknob to keep it neat. Tie each strand to a craft ring, pole, or strong wire to display them. This will keep all the strands together and make the senbazuru easier to display. Hang the craft ring, pole, or wire wherever you want to display the senbazuru.
