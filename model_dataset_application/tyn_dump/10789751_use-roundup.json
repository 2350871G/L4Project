The instructions recommend using 3\u20136 fluid ounces (89\u2013177 mL) of Roundup for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, but you may be able to get away with using as little 1\u20132 fluid ounces (30\u201359 mL) to kill off small or sparse vegetation. A sprayer will offer greater accuracy and allow you to only use as much herbicide as you need, while watering cans tend to be quicker and more convenient for treatments that cover a broad area."

You'll know it's working when the edges of the leaves start to droop or wilt and become dry and brown.
