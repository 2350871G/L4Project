If you don't want to wait an entire hour, allow the solution to sit for at least 30 minutes before pouring it out. If yours is an electric kettle with an automatic switch-off feature, feel free to let it switch off on its own instead of watching to see when it boils."

For best results, rinse out the kettle 2 or 3 times to get as much of the vinegar out of the inside as possible. If your kettle has a removable lid, take this lid off to make it easier to rinse out the interior. You can rinse the lid by itself to make sure it's also clean."

If a damp cloth isn't cutting it, add a little bit of baking soda to a damp sponge and use that to clean out the inside of the kettle.
