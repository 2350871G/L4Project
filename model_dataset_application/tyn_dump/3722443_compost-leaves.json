So, avoid using any thick or leathery leaves in your compost, including holly, magnolia, oak, birch, and beech. Also avoid leaves which can inhibit the growth of other plants (e.g., hackberry leaves). Oak leaves take longer to decompose than many other types of leaves. If you find that oak leaves comprise the majority of your compost pile, shred them more thoroughly than the other types of leaves to make sure they compost well.

    "If you\u2019re in the middle of a rainy spell, you may not need to water the compost pile for 3\u20134 weeks at a time.",
    "Check it every few days to make sure it hasn\u2019t dried out.",
    "Turn your compost every 2 weeks with a shovel or a pitchfork.",
    "Dig the tip of the pitchfork or shovel into the bottom of the pile of compost and turn clockwise to mix the compost.",
    "Continue mixing until the whole pile has been turned through.",
    "The top layer should be buried and the leaf compost should look fresh and wet on the top.",
    "Turning the compost pile allows the leaves to decompose uniformly and keeps a good mixture of oxygen throughout the pile.",
    "The heat that forms inside the moist pile of leaves and clippings is often called \u201ccooking.\u201d Add the finished compost to your garden soil after 4 to 9 months.",
    "When the material has finished composting and is ready to use, it will have a rich, earthy smell, and should feel thick and crumbly.",
    "You should no longer be able to pick out single leaves or grass blades.",
    "To use the compost, deposit a 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) layer on top of the soil in your garden or flower pots.",
    "Mix the compost in to the garden topsoil with your fingers.",
    "Although compost is a great way to increase the organic content of soil, it doesn\u2019t quite have the same nutritional value as a store-bought fertilizer."
