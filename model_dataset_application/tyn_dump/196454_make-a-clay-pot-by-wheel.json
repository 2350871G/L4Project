  "text":" Centering and Lubricating the Clay Place 2 to 3 pounds (0.91 to 1.36 kg) of clay on the pottery wheel. Position the clay in the center of the wheel. If you are a beginner, then start with 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of clay. If you are more experienced, then you can use more clay, such as 3 pounds (1.4 kg).
