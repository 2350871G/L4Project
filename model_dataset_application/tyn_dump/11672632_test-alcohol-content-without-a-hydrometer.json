    "Type the equation into a calculator and round the answer to the third decimal point to find the expected alcohol content of the wort once it\u2019s completely fermented.",
    "For example, if the initial specific gravity was 1.046 and the final specific gravity was 1.018, then the equation would read:  (76.08 * [1.046 - 1.018] / [1.775 - 1.046]) * (1.018 / 0.794).",
    "After putting the formula into a calculator, your result would be 3.747, which means the drink will be 3.747% alcohol by volume, which is how much alcohol is contained in 100 millilitres (3.4  fl oz)."
