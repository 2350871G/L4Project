  "text":" Making a Standing Christmas Tree Choose a napkin color for your tree. Green napkins are the obvious choice, but don't be afraid to use other Christmas colors like red or gold. You can give every place setting the same color, or alternate between two colors for more variety. There are many variations of the Christmas tree fold. The classic pleated Christmas tree fold can lie flat or stand. This standing Christmas tree fold results in a 3-dimensional standing Christmas tree. Fold the napkin in half crosswise. Lay the napkin open on a flat surface. Bring the left edge of the napkin over to meet the right edge, creating a rectangle with the fold on the left side. Line up the edges carefully so your tree will look even and polished. Fold the upper corners and lower corners down. Start by folding the two upper corners down so they meet in the middle.

It may help to keep one finger over the center crease of the triangle as you bring the left corner over to the right. Repeat the fold on the other side. Take the top layer of the lower left corner and bring it to the lower right corner. Then, bring the folded triangle edge at the lower right back to meet the triangle edge at the lower left. Your napkin should be in the shape of a triangle with an identical pleat on the left and right side. Fold the triangle in half. Bring the left side of the triangle to meet the right. Be careful not to disturb the folds. Pressing the folded triangle with an iron will help the tree keep its shape when you stand it upright. Stand the napkin upright. Spread the folds evenly.

If you don't have star napkin rings, you can also use a star pin, or attach a tiny bow, a sprig of mistletoe, or pine to the top of your tree with a safety pin. Folding Your Napkin Into an Elegant Fleur De Lis Fold the napkin in half horizontally. Spread the napkin on a flat surface. Bring the left edge of the napkin to meet the right edge. Turn the napkin so the folded edge is at the bottom, facing you. Fold the upper right and left corners down. Bring each corner down to the folded edge at the bottom of the rectangle. The napkin should now look like a triangle. Be sure to line up the edges of folds so they meet in the center without overlapping on each other. Fold the lower right and left corners up. Bring both corners up to meet at the top point of the triangle. You should now be looking at a diamond shape. The folds should line up with each other in the center without overlapping and should also line up with the top edges of the diamond. Fold the top points of the diamond out to form wings. Take the top layer of the left point at the top of the diamond. Fold it out to the side to form a wing. Repeat on the right side. Iron the napkin at this point to help the folds keep their shape. Slip a napkin ring onto the bottom part of the diamond. This will help shape the stem of the Fleur De Lis. Use a napkin ring that compliments the color of the napkin, or one that has a Christmas design. A Fleur De Lis fold is perfect if you are having a more formal dinner where you want to be festive but elegant. If you want a more casual or eye-catching Fleur De Lis fold, try tucking extra Christmas touches like mistletoe or a small ornament into the napkin ring. Adjust the folds to create a full, even Fleur De Lis shape. The napkin ring will help the folds keep their overall shape, so don't be afraid to pull a little more firmly to achieve the look you want.

    "Red or green would be classic colors for Christmas, but the pinwheel star looks great in any color.",
    "Consider matching your napkins with the rest of your table's decor.",
    "The pinwheel is a very simple fold by itself, which means it is also great for use with patterned napkins.",
    "Fold all four corners into the center.",
    "Lay the napkin open on a flat surface.",
    "Take each corner and fold it in so that the tip touches the very center of the napkin.",
    "Your napkin should now look like a diamond.",
    "Fold the top and bottom edges in.",
    "First, turn your diamond 45 degrees so you are looking at a square shape.",
    "Bring the top and bottom edges of the square to meet in the center.",
    "You should now have a rectangle.",
    "Iron the creases to help your pinwheel keep its shape.",
    "Fold the sides of the rectangle in.",
    "Take the left and right sides of the rectangle and bring them in to meet in the center.",
    "You should now have formed a square.",
    "Line up the edges in the center so that they do not overlap.",
    "Pull the corners out to form points.",
    "To do this, find the four loose corners at the center crease.",
    "Pull them out to the side one by one and lay them flat to form four points.",
    "Be careful not to disrupt the other folds in the process.",
    "Try gently lifting the upper layer at the center seam to expose the corners of the napkin.",
    "Don't pull up on the corners as you take them out as that might displace the other folds.",
    "Instead, think of pulling them gentle out to the side, keeping them as close to your working surface as possible.",
    "Fold the bottom left point to the left.",
    "This will form one of the pinwheel points.",
    "Repeat on the opposite side, folding the top right point to the right.",
    "You will now be able to see your final pinwheel shape!",
    "Try laying one finger on the napkin where you want the crease to be and fold the point over your finger.",
    "Lay the point on the table and slip your finger out of the crease.",
    "This will keep the crease straight.",
    "Add a Christmas decoration to the center of the pinwheel.",
    "Give the napkin even more Christmas flair by placing a small sprig of mistletoe, an ornament, or a bow in the very center of the napkin.",
    "Small Christmas tree figurines or ornaments look great placed at the center of the pinwheel.",
    "Creating Playful Elf Shoes Choose the napkin color for your elf shoes.",
    "Green is the classic choice, but you can also use red, brown, or any color you wish.",
    "Elf shoes also turn out great with colorful paper napkins for a more casual affair or for children's parties.",
    "Fold the napkin in half lengthwise.",
    "Spread the napkin on a flat surface.",
    "Then, bring the bottom edge up to meet the top edge.",
    "You should now have a rectangle with the folded edge facing you.",
    "Fold the napkin in half again.",
    "This time, bring the top edge to meet the bottom.",
    "Line the edges up carefully.",
    "You will now have a very long rectangle.",
    "If you are using a paper napkin, pick it up and crease the fold with your thumb and index finger.",
    "This will help your shoes keep their shape.",
    "Fold the the two sides in and down.",
    "The inner edges will meet in the center of the rectangle.",
    "Your napkin should now have a pointy tip at the top, and the left and right sides of the rectangle should be facing you.",
    "If you have made a paper airplane, this step may be familiar to you.",
    "If you are using a cloth napkin, it is a good idea to press the napkin with an iron at this point to help it maintain its shape.",
    "Fold the edges in again to meet in the center.",
    "Line up the edges carefully.",
    "This will form an even sharper, thinner point at the tip.",
    "You may also recognize this step if you have made a paper airplane.",
    "Fold the napkin in half.",
    "Bring the left edge to meet the right edge.",
    "Lay it on the table with the folded edge at the top of the napkin and the open side facing towards you.",
    "You should now begin to see the basic shape of the shoe forming.",
    "The open side facing you will be the sole of the shoe.",
    "If you are using a paper napkin, crease this fold with your fingers so it will hold its shape.",
    "Fold the top layer of the back of the shoe up towards the top.",
    "Arrange the shoe on your work surface so the back of the shoe is on the right.",
    "Grab just the top layer of the back of the shoe and fold it up\nThe back of the shoe is the wider side opposite the small pointed tip.",
    "Fold the bottom layer of the back of the shoe towards the front.",
    "Take the remaining bottom layer at the back and fold it to the left.",
    "Tuck it into the little flap on the side of the shoe.",
    "Be sure the fold is lying flat inside the flap of the shoe.",
    "If it wrinkles or folds inside the flap, it can distort the shape of the shoe.",
    "Stand your shoe upright.",
    "Fold the extra material at the top down to form the cuff of the shoe.",
    "Arrange the cuff so it lies evenly against the base of the shoe.",
    "Now you're looking at your elf shoe!",
    "Add some extra flourish by tying a bell or ornament under the cuff.",
    "Pinch and curl the toe of the shoe to make it look even more elf-like."
