Brushing the Doll's Hair Choose a good time to do the hair. When your doll is about to get her beauty sleep, do her hair. Place a face cloth over your doll's eyes and secure at the back with an elastic band. Repeat with the plastic bag. Fill a spray bottle with water.  Spray your AG Doll's hair. Spray three times in three different sections. Then brush the hair from bottom to top, since the bottom is where it gets the most frizzy. To prevent frizzy hair don't keep them in the sun for very long. Keep the AG Doll's body away from water. Water can sink into the wool and mess up the cotton inside, making her less huggable. Also keep water away from their eyes. Finish up. If it's bedtime, put her pajamas on. She will seem fresh and new as if you just got her. Dealing with Curly Hair Lightly mist your doll's curly hair with water.  Brush the curly hair using a styling pick. If you don't have one, you can get one at the American Girl Doll store. Take small sections of the hair and brush it once again. Then finger style it. Wrap sections of the hair around your finger. Curl inward for the best style. Done. Allow it to air dry.",
