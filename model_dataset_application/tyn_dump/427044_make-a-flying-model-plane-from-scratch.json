Use a protractor or an object with a squared edge, like a small book, to get 90 degree angles. Use a ruler or other flat edge to help you draw straight lines. Then, cut out the shapes you've created. You will need to trace and cut out the following shapes:\n2 right triangles measuring 15 by 15 by 21.5 inches (38.1 \u00d7 38.1 \u00d7 54.6 cm). 1 square that measures 10.6 by 10.6 inches (26.9 cm \u00d7 26.9 cm)."

They are the two little tabs at on the back of the wings that rotate up and down. Just as you did for the airplane's body, trace and cut out the following shapes for the elevons:\n2 rectangles that measure 1.5 by 14.5 inches (3.8 cm \u00d7 37 cm). 2 squares measuring 1.5 by 1.5 inches (3.8 cm \u00d7 3.8 cm)."

To make it, start with a square that measures 6 by 6 inches (15.2 cm \u00d7 15.2 cm). Then, do the following:\nMark one inch inward from the top right and bottom left corners. Draw a diagonal line between the two points, and cut along the line. Keep one half of the square."

At a 45 degree angle, notch a groove into each of the reinforced patches (squares.) Make sure the control horns fit into the grooves, then glue them in. In other words, the straight edges of the Popsicle sticks will stick into the reinforced ends of the elevons. The edge with the hole should be facing up."

Make sure that the reinforced sides face the middle. Tape each elevon to the body, making sure to cover the full length of each with the tape. If needed,  cut away the excess tape from the outer corners. Stand the plane up on its nose and bend the elevons forward without crushing your control horns.. Put a piece of tape along the join of the bent elevons. This will give the hinge added strength. Work it back and forth to make it flexible enough for the small motor controls to control."

Using it as a guide, cut a groove along this line. After testing to make sure it fits, slot in the vertical stabilizer, one straight edge down into this groove. Glue it in place, making sure to smear some of the glue on either side of the stabilizer for the strongest hold.
