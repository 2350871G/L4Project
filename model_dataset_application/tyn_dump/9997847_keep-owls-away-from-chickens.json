This is when owls begin to prey and the time when your chickens need the most protection. Chickens should always be in their coop from sunset to sunrise. This reinforces the location as their safe-zone. If your coop exceeds temperatures of 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F), consider installing fans to provide a more comfortable home."

          "description":"These are the simplest kinds of chicken coops and typically consist of a floorless wooden box with some chicken wire around it (some of them also come with a roof). Floorless coops are cheaper and much easier to move than bigger products, which allows you to move your chicken flock regularly, adapting to the new predator locations and perching spots. Use a wire net or tarp to cover floorless coops without a roof. Always keep a lookout for new predator locations by scouting the ground underneath nearby trees for large feathers and regurgitated pellets of bone and hair. Switching chickens to a floorless coop [[requires retraining to establish the coop as their new home."

For an easy solution, place a 210 L (55-gallon) plastic drum on its side and cut a hole along it that's big enough for chickens to hide in. Fill the shelter with hay to provide comfort. Place 1 brick on each side of the drum to prevent it from rolling."

Netting is typically placed over structural openings on your coop and can be attached with bird netting mounting clips. You can also use a tarp sheet if you want to give your chickens some shade. Local hardware or garden stores should stock all of these materials. Be sure to get some measurements from your coop so that you purchase something that is big enough. Use orange netting if possible, as both owls and hawks see this color well. Larger coops usually provide adequate protection for your chickens, making netting unnecessary."

If you plant your own ground cover plants, make sure they are varieties that chickens can eat like lavender, rosemary, sage, wormwood, fennel, thyme, nasturtium, and comfrey. Double-check that they are suited to your climate zone. Purchase pH papers online to check if your soil matches optimal pH levels. If it's outside of the recommended range of the plant you're going to grow, use an appropriate adjustment technique. Ground cover also provides shade for your chickens during the hot summer months."

Before you conduct any removal services, make sure that any tree or structure you're removing is on your property. Hire an arborist for anything you are uncomfortable doing on your own.

Owls typically perch in high spots to observe your chickens and plan their method of attack. Take note of any regions that could be used for roosting in proximity of your chicken coop and place roosting spikes on them, such as near rain gutters. Roosting spikes can be purchased online or at local home hardware stores, and are also called \"pigeon spikes.\" Use non-silicone-based outdoor construction glue to apply spikes to steel.
