As a general rule, cockroaches lay about 30 eggs in what is called an ootheca or egg purse. Upon nearing maturity, these are dropped anywhere the roach might be.Due to airborne particulates from the cockroach fecal matter, the cockroach exoskeleton and various body parts left behind cockroaches can be a direct cause of respiratory ailments.

A vacuum cleaner can be used to cut down the spider population immediately and vacuuming out the webs will stop the increase of spiders in future days and months. In removing a spiderweb, you remove the spider's home, the nursery for future baby spiders, and the spider's grocery store. (On occasion the spider web itself is actually consumed by the spider!) This is a pretty big deal since one of those egg sacks can have 300 little baby spiders in it. While most never make it to maturity, imagine roughly half becoming egg laying females. That's 150 times 300 eggs!Vacuum up every spiderweb you can find. By removing the web, you're removing all the comforts that the spider needs to survive and repopulate. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5d\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5d\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nUse an extended vacuum end of a canister vacuum cleaner to reach high places. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nA hand-held vacuum is useful for the nooks and crannies where spiders tend to hide. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6a\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6a\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Deal with Indian meal moths and other pantry pests.

If you feed your pets inside, keep in mind that a major source of pantry pests is dry pet food and bird feed. Be sure to vacuum pet feeding areas and pet food storage areas often. Fight cockroaches with your vacuum. There are several types of cockroaches that may like your home. The first cockroach gets there through various means - flying through open windows, walking in the door but the most notorious the German cockroach has to be transported via your grocery bag, the cute little dresser from the garage sale or even in that sugar you borrowed from the neighbors. As a general rule, cockroaches lay about 30 eggs in what is called an ootheca or egg purse. Upon nearing maturity, these are dropped anywhere the roach might be.Due to airborne particulates from the cockroach fecal matter, the cockroach exoskeleton and various body parts left behind cockroaches can be a direct cause of respiratory ailments. A non-HEPA vacuum may exacerbate the problem, so only use a vacuum with a HEPA filter. A vacuum cleaner is particularly useful in the control of roaches because the ootheca is readily visible and quickly vacuumed up. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0b\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0b\\/Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Do-Pest-Control-With-a-Vacuum-Cleaner-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nLook for the ootheca in drawers, on shelves, under cabinets or anywhere cockroaches my be living.

Vacuum the mattresses and pillows of all beds in the home to reduce the dust mite population. Dispose of the vacuum cleaner contents properly, in a sealed container. Vacuum carpets thoroughly to remove fleas. Be sure to vacuum under furniture as well as on the open carpet. You might also wish to add flea powder to the vacuum cleaner bag or on the carpet if this won't cause problems for your cleaner. Dispose of properly. Vacuum away silverfish. Silverfish like damp conditions, so tend to be found in the kitchen and bathroom areas. Use the vacuum cleaner to remove food particles and silverfish eggs. Remove ladybugs from your home. Ladybugs can congregate in numbers large enough to infest your home over the winter break. While they're beneficial insects in the garden, disturbed ladybugs can emit a bad odor and can cause allergic reactions in susceptible people. If you're experiencing a problem with them, vacuuming them up in a fresh bag or vacuum container and then depositing them somewhere far away in the garden can be one way of getting them out of the house and back into being beneficial in the garden. After vacuuming, place cloves in window sills and anywhere else there are cracks that they might be attracted back to. You can also try wiping down with clove oil diluted with some water. Vacuum up the slow-moving cluster fly. These flies tend to infest homes around August through to October and tend to cluster on high ceilings. In all cases of using your vacuum cleaner for pest removal, always empty your vacuum cleaner and tie up the bag immediately after vacuuming, putting the bag outside in the trash. If they're not trapped inside, the spiders and insects will crawl out wherever they're left.",
