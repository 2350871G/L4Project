Use a piece of sandpaper and rub it into the wood in short, aggressive circular motions. Apply heavy pressure while scraping your wood. After the mold is visibly gone, reseal your wood with paint or sealant. 40-150 grit sandpaper is a good starting point for the sanding process, since you need to remove an entire layer of wood to remove all of the mold.
