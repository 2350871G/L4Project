          "description":"Before you decide to strip the covers off of you mattress and search for holes, know that no air mattress holds air indefinitely. You will naturally have to re-inflate your mattress whether or not you have a leak. Cold air, for example, causes your mattress to shrink. As the house cools down at night, your air mattress will likely soften a bit as the air cools. A space heater by the mattress can prevent this problem. Air mattresses need to \u201cstretch\u201d after they are bought. Don\u2019t be alarmed if they feel soft shortly after you inflate them the first few times, they will quickly adapt."

Sit on the mattress after you blow it up \u2013 it should not sink more than 1-2 inches under your weight. If you are still not sure if there is a leak, leave your mattress inflated overnight and put weight on it, like several textbooks. If it is more than a little deflated in the morning, you have a leak. Keep the mattress inflated as you search for the leak. If you feel the mattress becoming soft, reinflate it before you start searching again. The higher the air pressure inside the mattress the more forceful the leak will be, making it easier to notice."

To do so:\nFill a small bucket with water and a few drops (1 teaspoon) of liquid dishwashing soap. Using a sponge, slowly wipe down the surfaces of the mattress with soapy water.
