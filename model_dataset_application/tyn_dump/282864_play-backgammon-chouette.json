          "description":"Before you start a game of backgammon chouette, have each player throw a die. The player who rolls the highest number is designated as the box. That player will play against all of the other players who will form a team. In a betting game, the benefit of playing as the box is that each member of the opposite team will be required to pay you if you win. However, you will have to pay each member of the opposite team if you lose. For example, if you are playing against three people and the bet is $1, then you would win $3 if you win the game. But if you lose the game, then you would have to pay each player $1."

          "description":"Many chouette matches are played with multiple doubling cubes so that each player and team member has a personal doubling cube. But you can still play with a single doubling cube so that only the box and captain may raise the stakes. Playing with multiple doubling cubes allows players who are observing the captain and box to raise the stakes at any time, but the double does not apply to the rest of the players. For example, if one player chooses to double, then the double would only apply to that player and the box. Therefore if the box loses the round and the starting bet was $2, then the box would have to pay the player who doubled twice the amount of the starting bet ($4). Keep in mind that the doubling cube can go up to 64, so the stakes can become quite high in a game of backgammon chouette."

If you are betting, then make sure that everyone places their bets prior to the start of the game. It is also a good idea to confirm that all of the players agree to the stakes. Remember that the box has to pay the bet amount for each member of the team he or she is playing against. Therefore, if the bet is $2 and there are five people on the opposing team, then the box must pay in $10 total. If one of the players uses the doubling cube during the round, then the bet amount increases along with it. For example, if the starting bet was $2 and the box or the captain doubles once, then the new bet is $4."
