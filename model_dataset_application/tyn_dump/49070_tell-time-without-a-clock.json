This is also helpful if you cannot fit your whole hand between the sin and the horizon. In this case, you will only need to count the fingers between the sun and horizon instead. Each finger that will fit in this space represents 15 extra minutes before sunset. Multiply the number of fingers by 15 and add this to the number of hands you counted. For example, if you counted 4 hands and 2 fingers, then you have approximately 4.5 hours left until sunset.

    "Repeat this for every hour of the day.",
    "For example, if it is 7:00 am, then write this next to the thumb tack.",
    "Then, come back an hour later, and mark the location of 8:00 am on the board.",
    "Continue until the sun sets and there is no longer a shadow to track.",
    "Keep in mind that the straw\u2019s shadow will only be visible around half of the board and the length of the shadows will vary as the day goes on.",
    "Leave your sundial in the same location and visit it to check the time.",
    "Now that you have marked the sundial for each hour of the day, you can use it to tell time while you are outside.",
    "Keep in mind that this will only work during the day and it works best when there are no or few clouds.",
    "Also, be aware that the sundial will gradually become less accurate since the amount of daylight changes over time.",
    "Plan to make a new sundial about once every 3 months.",
    "Don\u2019t move the sundial!",
    "It needs to stay in the same location to be accurate.",
    "Tracking the North Star Locate the Big Dipper.",
    "At night, go to a location free from bright lights or significant pollution.",
    "Using a compass, find north and stand facing it.",
    "The position of the Big Dipper may change depending on your geographic location but will be in the northern area.",
    "The Big Dipper is comprised of 7 stars shaped like a bowl with a handle.",
    "The 4 stars making up the bowl are shaped like a rhombus, with the 3 stars making the handle organized in a line to its left or right depending on the hemisphere you are in.",
    "The Big Dipper will be easier (or harder) to spot during some seasons, depending on your location.",
    "For example, it might be harder to spot the Big Dipper in the winter if you are in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Use the Big Dipper to find the North Star.",
    "Spot the 2 stars making up the line opposite the handle of the Big Dipper's bowl (Dubhe and Merak).",
    "Trace an imaginary line from that point upward, about 5 times as large as the line between Dubhe and Merak.",
    "When you reach a bright star in this approximate location, you have reached the North Star.",
    "Picture the North Star as the center of a large clock in the sky.",
    "Divide the sky into 24 sections around the North Star, as evenly as you can estimate.",
    "The North Star (or Polaris) can function as the center of a 24 hour clock in the sky.",
    "Keep in mind that an analog clock moves 30 degrees per hour, but a Polaris-focused clock will only move 15 degrees per hour and in the opposite direction of an analog clock.",
    "Use the Big Dipper to calculate the raw time.",
    "After sectioning the sky, estimate the time by using the Big Dipper as an imaginary hour hand.",
    "When the Big Dipper's star opposite the handle (Dubhe) passes through your section, this is the raw time.",
    "However, keep in mind that this will only give you a rough estimate.",
    "For example, if the hand is pointing straight up from the North Star, then the raw time is midnight.",
    "Tip: Remember that the hours on the clock are reversed since the hand moves in a counterclockwise direction.",
    "For example, if the hand is pointing straight out to the left, then the time is 3:00 am.",
    "Calculate the actual time using a special equation.",
    "If you need a more accurate time reading, then you can perform a calculation to find it.",
    "The calculation you need to use is: (Time = Raw Time \u2013 [2 X the number of months since March 6]).",
    "If the date is March 6 exactly, you will need to make no calculations.",
    "During any other day of the year, however, this calculation is vital to get a more precise calculation.",
    "For example, if the Raw Time is 5 AM on May 2nd, you would use the equation Time = 5 - (2 X 2) to get 1 AM.",
    "This equation is not exact.",
    "The actual time may be anywhere within a half hour of your calculated time.",
    "Account for daylight savings time by adding 1 hour to the time.",
    "If daylight savings time is currently in effect in your time zone, add 1 hour to the time.",
    "Only do this during the months when Daylight Savings Time (DST) is in effect.",
    "For example, if the time you calculated was 1:00 am, then adding 1 hour would make it 2:00 am.",
    "Telling Time by Moon Phases Use the moon to tell time only when it is at its brightest.",
    "Monitoring moon phases is not as accurate of a way to keep time as making a sundial or measuring by the North Star.",
    "Based on the current lunar phase, the moon will only be visible in the night sky for a certain amount of time and it will be easiest to see when it is full or almost full.",
    "For example, during a full moon, the moon will be visible in the sky all night (for approximately 12 hours).",
    "The moon will be harder to spot throughout the night when it is not full.",
    "Tip: On the day of the new moon, you will not be able to spot it in the night sky at all and you\u2019ll need to use a different option to tell time.",
    "Find out what time the sun set.",
    "Knowing when the sun set will give you a baseline time to start tracking the time with the moon since the moon rises about 1 hour after the sun sets.",
    "If you can, look up the time that the sun set before you observe the moon\u2019s position and add 1 hour to this time to create a baseline time.",
    "For example, if the sun set at 6:30 pm, and the moon is just now visible on the horizon, then it is approximately 7:30 pm.",
    "Track the position of the moon to determine the approximate time.",
    "You can use the moon to tell time by dividing the sky into quarters and noting the moon\u2019s position in the sky.",
    "Find the middle of the sky, and then divide these 2 halves in half to divide the sky into quarters going from east to west.",
    "This won\u2019t give you an accurate time, but you can get a good estimate.",
    "Look at the moon's position in the sky in relation to where it rose.",
    "For example, if the moon is \u00bc of the way across the sky from where it rose, then it is about 3 hours past sundown.",
    "If the moon is halfway across the sky, then it is approximately 6 hours past sundown.",
    "If the moon is \u00be of the way across the sky, then it is 9 hours past sundown.",
    "Use the moon\u2019s position to calculate the approximate time.",
    "The location of the moon in the sky along with the time the sun set, will allow you to calculate an approximate time.",
    "Once you have noted these details, add the number of hours for the position of the moon to the time of sunset.",
    "For example, if the sun set at 7:00 pm, and the moon in halfway across the sky, then the approximate time is 1:00 am.",
    "If the sun set at 6:15 pm, and the moon is \u00be of the way across the sky, then the approximate time is 3:15 am."
