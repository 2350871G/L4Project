  "text":" Preparing the Outer Layer Score the fat on the picanha. One side of the picanha will be entirely covered in a layer of white fat while the other side isn\u2019t. Use a sharp knife to cut a criss-cross pattern into the fat, making sure you don\u2019t cut into the actual meat. Rub both sides of the meat with lots of salt. Sprinkle salt over each side of the picanha, using your hands to pat it into the meat if desired. Use a generous amount of salt, as this is the only seasoning that\u2019s necessary. Rock salt is the best type to use on the meat. Remove the skin from the non-fat side, if necessary. The skin is a similar color to the fat, but it's very thin and doesn\u2019t cover all of the meat. If you see skin on the meat side of the picanha, cut it off with a sharp knife and discard it. You don\u2019t need to cut anything off of the fat side of the meat. Searing the Picanha Set the grill or pan to high heat. If you\u2019re using a grill to cook the picanha, turn it to high heat and let it heat up for several minutes beforehand.
