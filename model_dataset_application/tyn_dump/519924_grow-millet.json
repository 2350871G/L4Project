          "description":"Millet seeds or \"sprays\" containing seeds are often sold as bird food, but these come in many varieties and may not be reliably labeled. While bird owners have reported success planting these seeds, or even growing them accidentally by dropping them in the garden, seeds or young plants purchased from a plant nursery will most likely be labeled with an exact species. This gives you a better idea of what to expect, and may help you find more specific answers to problems you encounter while growing. \"Ornamental millet\" varieties such as Purple Majesty or Foxtail Millet Highlander are recommended for small garden plots due to their attractive appearance. They still produce edible seeds that will attract birds and other wildlife. Some millet varieties, such as Golden Millet, grow to 18\u201324 inches (46\u201361 cm) in height, while other common varieties require more space and reach 5 feet (1.5 m) or more in height. Your millet plant may not reach its maximum height in cool climates. If you plan on eating the millet or feeding it to birds, use organic millet seeds and do not treat the plant with pesticides."

Alternatively, you can start the seeds directly outdoors as long as the frost is over and soil temperatures are above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C), but be aware that this may not give the plant time to mature and produce seeds by the end of the growing season."

Using soil from your garden may not be as effective, but you can attempt to grow millet in any soil that drains quickly. Mix perlite or sand into the soil if the soil clumps together or tends to stay soggy after watering."

Transplant them into outdoor pots or directly into the garden, using the same soil they were in before. Try to plant the seedlings to the same depth they were before. Keep the millet in full sun unless it shows signs of withering or burning. Avoid burying the stem that was previously above the soil level. The recommended size of the pot or spacing of the plants varies greatly with the type of millet. If the weather is hot or the seedlings are still small, consider keeping them in an outdoor area with partial shade and wind protection for one or two weeks before moving them to an area of full sun. This allows them to gradually adjust to outdoor conditions."

Generally speaking, millet plants enjoy good-draining soil and do best if the soil is not allowed to dry out completely. Millet is unlikely to survive freezing temperatures either as seeds or adult plants, and most types thrive in warm weather. If your millet appears unhealthy or some of the plants die, have a botanist or garden nursery employee identify your species of millet and suggest specific care. If your millet rots or looks slimy at the base or roots, reduce watering. If your millet dries out or falls over, it may be a short-root variety. Add compost to the soil to help trap moisture and provide a sturdier support for the plants."

The time it takes for millet to mature varies greatly with variety and climate, so once the plants flower, keep an eye out for seed pods. These pods grow among the fluffy ends of the plant, and eventually open up to release seeds. Periodically break open a pod to see if the seeds inside are brown or black. If they are, the pods are ready for collecting. Gather them individually, or simply cut off the whole stalk. Note that millet is an annual crop, meaning the plant will die after producing seeds."

Alternatively, feed fresh or dry seeds to pet birds in small quantities as treats. If you have enough millet seeds, you can boil them into a porridge. Together, millets and other treats should not make up more than 10% of your bird's diet."

Some farmers grow millet as forage crops or to attract wildlife, while farmers in India, Africa, or China harvest the grain to sell as food for humans. Be sure to select a variety suited to your purpose and to your local climate and soil. The following are the most common types of millet, but note that each one has many subtypes with varying characteristics:\n\nPearl millet is most commonly grown to produce birdseed or poultry feed in the southwestern United States, or as human food in India and Africa. Foxtail millet grows reliably in semi-arid conditions, and has a fast growing time that allows it to be planted later than other crops. Proso millet is another hardy millet with fast growing times. Inside the United States, its growth is concentrated in Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Finger millet can grow at higher altitudes or hillier conditions than many other crops, and is favored by some subsistence farmers due to its cheap cost and long storage times."

This is typically 3 or 4 weeks after corn planting time and 1 to 2 weeks after sorghum planting time in your area.

You may wish to plant to a depth of \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) for small seed. A seed drill with a small seed attachment may be required for some varieties.

    "Clear the seedbed of all weeds and prepare it depending on soil type.",
    "Deep-till hard or textured soil to break up hardpan soils.",
    "If your soil has high clay content or erodes, you may have better success with no tillage or conservation tillage (leaving last year's crop remains on the soil).",
    "For limited tilling, planting later is advisable as these seedbeds will be cooler.",
    "You may plant some varieties of millet on fallow fields, although you will likely not receive maximum yields if you do not provide nitrogen fertilizer.",
    "Plant millet at a shallow depth.",
    "Standard millet planting depths range from \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm), as the seeds are rarely strong enough to reach the surface if planted any deeper.",
    "You may wish to plant to a depth of \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) for small seed.",
    "A seed drill with a small seed attachment may be required for some varieties.",
    "The seeds can also be planted by hand in furrows that are closed over them.",
    "Adjust your spacing depending on variety and local conditions.",
    "Soil type, climate, and millet variety all affect the density your field can support, so seeking local advice is recommended.",
    "As a general rule, millet can produce good forage when sown at 4\u20135 lbs/acre (4.5\u20135.5 kg/ha), but can support seeding as high as 20\u201330 lbs/acre (22\u201334 kg/ha) if irrigated.",
    "Space millet rows farther apart if grown for cultivation rather than forage.",
    "Fertilize millet with nitrogen.",
    "Many millet varieties can grow in poor soil or even fallow fields, but fertilizing is recommended for higher crop yields.",
    "Apply 40\u201350 lbs of nitrogen per acre (45\u201356 kg/ha) after planting, and another 40\u201350 lbs/acre (45\u201356 kg/ha) after 3 or 4 weeks.",
    "Some soils may require potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or sulfur as well.",
    "If you cannot find recommended levels of these minerals for your millet, you may follow guidelines for sorghum instead.",
    "Drill row fertilizer applications may harm millet, unless the fertilizer is straight phosphorus.",
    "Cut millet and leave in the field if using for hay.",
    "Foxtail millet, and possibly other varieties, deteriorate quickly if left alone after the growing season.",
    "Swathe and windrow them instead, leaving the cut plants in the field until late fall or early winter to dry before you bale the hay.",
    "Make sure all weed and pest control substances are safe for millet.",
    "Millet is a type of grass, and so can be killed by some grass-controlling herbicides; other herbicides and insecticides may not be safe for use on forage crops, cultivated crops, or both.",
    "The exact diseases and insect pests that attack millet crops vary widely by region, and can be best prepared for with crop rotation and seed treatment.",
    "Learn as much as you can from local millet farmers or your regional agriculture department or society.",
    "Harvest millet before migrating birds appear.",
    "Keep a careful eye on grain development and bird activity, as the harvesting window can be short between the ripening of the grain and the appearance of large bird flocks.",
    "Harvesting methods vary by millet variety and intended use, but be sure to cut low enough to obtain the entire ear.",
    "Millet seeds should be stored at 13% moisture or less."
