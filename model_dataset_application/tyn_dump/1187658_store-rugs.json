If you are not sure how to clean the rug, read its label or seek professional advice. Always vacuum a rug before storing; this will remove dander, flea eggs, dust mites, etc., prior to storage. Use an appropriate setting on the vacuum so as not to damage it. If it cannot be vacuumed, at least beat the rug outdoors and leave it to air in sunshine for a day before storing. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b8\\/1187658--1A.jpg\\/460px-1187658--1A.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b8\\/1187658--1A.jpg\\/760px-1187658--1A.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":307,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":507.3626373626374,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nSee the Related articles for a range of cleaning help for different types of rugs. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2c\\/1187658--1B.jpg\\/460px-1187658--1B.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2c\\/1187658--1B.jpg\\/760px-1187658--1B.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":307,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":507.3626373626374,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
