Use one container for each color of glitter. Use an amount of salt equivalent to the amount of glitter that you want. There are no other ingredients besides food coloring, so the amount you start with will be the amount of glitter you get. For a sweeter glitter, you can try using granulated white sugar instead. There's a risk that sugar might melt into a syrup, which will not happen with salt."
