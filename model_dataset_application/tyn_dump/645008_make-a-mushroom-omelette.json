  "text":" Preparing the Mushroom Filling Wash the mushrooms and cut them into thin slices. You can leave the stems on, or discard them. Be sure to scrub the mushrooms with a soft-bristled brush to remove any dirt. You don't need to peel them. Heat 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of unsalted butter in a medium-sized frying pan over medium heat. Save the rest of the butter for the frying the eggs. Wait until the butter starts to sizzle and foam. When the butter starts to sizzle, add the mushrooms, some salt, and some pepper. How much salt you use is up to your personal tastes. For extra flavor, add 1 clove minced garlic. You can also add some sliced onion or scallions. Fry the mushrooms until they turn soft and brown. This will take about 4 minutes. Stir the mushrooms from time to time using a spatula, so they don't burn. Remove the mushrooms from the pan, and set them aside. Place them into a bowl or onto a plate. Cover them with a lid, plate, or a piece of foil to keep them warm. You will be adding the mushrooms to your omelette just before serving it. Making the Omelette Crack two eggs into a bowl, and add the salt, pepper, and water. For a lighter omelette, use 4 egg whites instead. The water will evaporate when you fry the eggs, and help make them fluffier in the end. Beat the eggs with a fork until they turn frothy. If you are using whole eggs (instead of whites), make sure that you break the yolks up. You won't be scrambling the eggs once you add them into the frying pan. Heat the rest of the butter in the frying pan over medium-high heat. The butter will start to sizzle and foam. Don't add the eggs yet. Instead, wait until the foam starts to disappear. Tilt pan to coat the bottom with oil, then add the eggs. Once you have the eggs on the pain, continue tilting the pan around until the entire bottom is evenly covered with the egg mixture. If necessary, use the tip of your spatula to help spread the egg mixture across the bottom of the pan. For extra flavor, add 2 chopped, green shallots. Let the omelette cook until the edges turn firm, then pull the edges away from the sides of the frying pan. This will happen after only a few seconds. Pulling the edges of the omelette away from the pan will allow the raw egg mixture to flow onto the hot pan and cook. Let the omelette cook for about 1 minutes. As it continues to cook, it will turn opaque and set. Don't \"scramble\" the omelette during this time, or you will get scrambled eggs instead. Add the mushroom mixture when the omelette still has some raw egg on top. Only cover half of the omelette with the mushroom mixture; you will be folding the omelette in half.
