  "text":" Selecting the Beads, Needle, and Thread Select the beads you want to use. You can sew any kind of beads you like onto a piece of fabric, but make sure to consider how the beads and fabric will look together.

Make sure that the needle and its eye are small enough to go all the way through each of your beads. For very small beads, you may need to use a fine tapestry needle, such as a size 28. Choose a durable thread that will blend in with the fabric and beads. To ensure that your beads will stay put, use a strong polyester thread. If you are using beads that are a different color than your fabric, then choose thread in a color that will blend in with the beads. For example, if the beads are white and the fabric is black, go with a white thread. However, if you are using red beads with red fabric, then choose a red thread as well. Locking Thread in the Fabric Thread a needle with 18 in (46 cm) of thread and tie a knot in the end. Insert the end of your thread through the eye of the needle and pull until half of the strand is through the eye and the ends are even. Then, tie a knot in the ends of the thread.

Creating the first stitch this way will help to ensure that your beads will not come undone. Sewing Beads onto Fabric Bring the needle back up and through the fabric. When you are ready to add the first bead, insert the needle up through the same hole you made for the first stitch.
