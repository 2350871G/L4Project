Add the milk to a measuring cup, then measure out the lemon juice or white vinegar and add it to the cup. You can use whole milk or 2% lowfat milk. Skim milk has too little fat content to curdle properly. Many people prefer using lemon juice to curdle the milk, but white vinegar works just as well. Lemon juice may add a lighter note that cuts through the richness of the milk perfectly while still making it tangy. Multiply the recipe as needed. For instance, add 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of acid to 2  c (470 mL) of milk if you need 2 cups of buttermilk."
