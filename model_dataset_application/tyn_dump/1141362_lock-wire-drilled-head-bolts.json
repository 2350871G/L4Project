    "Use the preferred sizes 0.020, 0.025, 0.032 of wire depending on the size of the hole in bolt. The smaller sizes are used for smaller holes. The wire diameter used is 0.020, or 0.025. The larger sizes are used where stronger wire is required. Wire diameter of .032 is the most commonly used and will be used in the video.",
