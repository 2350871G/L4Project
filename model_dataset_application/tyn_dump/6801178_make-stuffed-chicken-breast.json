          "description":"You'll need a relatively thick cut of meat, and regular boneless, skinless chicken breasts are usually sufficient. Avoid anything labeled tenders, filets, or thin-cut. You'll also need a sharp, smooth paring knife with a 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10 cm) blade. Avoid serrated knives since these won't be able to pierce through the side of the chicken without sawing it."

          "description":"Place one chicken breast in the center of the cutting board, aligning it vertically. Hold it steady with your non-dominant hand. Press gently. If you apply too much pressure, the knife might have difficulty sliding through the chicken. Keep your fingers centered and slightly offset to your non-dominant side to keep them out of the way of the knife."

          "description":"Using your dominant hand, hold the knife at a perpendicular angle to the chicken breast. Slid it into the side of the chicken breast at the approximate midpoint. If one side is thicker than the other, pierce the chicken closer to the thicker side. The knife should be halfway between the top and bottom of the chicken breast. Only slide the knife about two-thirds of the way through the side of the chicken. Do not cut through to the other side."

Remove the knife, insert it back into your starting position, and slice the same side open downward. The entire time, keep the knife centered between the top and bottom of the chicken breast. Do not pierce through to the other side. Note that the easiest way to stuff chicken breast is to cut this side completely so that it can open like a book\u2014a culinary technique known as \"butterflying.\" If you'd like to minimize the cut space along the side and keep more of the stuffing in the chicken, however, try the advanced pocket technique:\nFrom your starting cut, carefully saw the tip of the knife up and toward the outside edge of the chicken breast without cutting back through the original side or expanding the opening. Flip the knife around and repeat the same motion toward the bottom side of your original pocket. Again, you'll need to avoid expanding the opening."

          "description":"If you cut one side completely open, use your fingers to pry the chicken breast open like a book, continuing until it can lie with the \"spine\" flat on the cutting board. Depending on how deep the original cut runs, you may need to cut the opening a little wider using the knife before the chicken breast will lie flat enough. If you used the pocket method instead of the butterflying technique, place your finger inside the pocket opening and work it into the inner cavity, breaking any loose fibers and expanding the opening as much as possible."

You can opt to use marinara sauce to add another dimension of taste to this stuffing, but it isn't necessary; the cheese and pepperoni are flavorful enough. If you do use the sauce, however, note that you should only spread a thin coating over the bottom of the open chicken breast to prevent the dish from getting too messy.

Consider broiling the bell pepper before chopping it. Slice the bell pepper in half, remove the seeds and inner membranes, and broil it for 15 minutes, or until it becomes charred.

Stuffing the Chicken Fill the chicken breast with your chosen stuffing. Mixed stuffings should be spread evenly across the open chicken breast, while stuffings consisting of separate ingredients should be layered over the open chicken breast.
