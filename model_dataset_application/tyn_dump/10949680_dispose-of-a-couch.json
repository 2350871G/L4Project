Oftentimes, food residue can get into your couch and can stay there for a long time. If you don't have a vacuum handy, use a brush and dustpan to get rid of as much waste as you can.

Keeping some of the trash at home simply makes that job a little bit easier. Make sure to take your couch pieces to a designated waste disposal facility. Flatten the backseat of your car to fit the pieces of your couch. Lay some tarp, a blanket, or a bedsheet down before putting the couch pieces in to protect the seats. If you don't have tarp, use an old blanket or bed sheet instead. If your car is too small, consider renting a trailer or borrowing a pickup truck. Tip: Garbage companies will sometimes charge you to throw away full couches in public dumpsters. If you break your couch down to small pieces of wood and fabric, they can't charge you anything because it's just regular trash at that point."
