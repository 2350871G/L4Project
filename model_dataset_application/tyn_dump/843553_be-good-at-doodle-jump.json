It's tempting to aim for a higher platform but, by design, many platforms are just barely out of reach. Aiming for a lower platform is worth the extra time considering how long it would take to get back that lofty level."

Started shooting earlier or from a lower platform? Jumping off the screen (left or right) to re-emerge on the opposite side so as to avoid a black hole or monster? It may take several games before you find the same scene but you'll be better prepared for it if you stay calm and try to learn from your mistake instead of going bonkers in frustration."
