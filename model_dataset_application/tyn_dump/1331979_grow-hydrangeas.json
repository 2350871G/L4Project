Start by looking at a planting zone hardiness map to determine the number of your zone. There are hundreds of varieties of hydrangeas to choose from. If this is your first time planting these beautiful flowers, you may want to choose from among these common varieties that are known to be hardy and produce long-lasting blooms. Mophead and lacecap hydrangeas, or \"bigleaf\" hydrangeas, don't do as well in colder regions unless you take measures to protect them from frost. Look for the \"Endless Summer\" mop-head variety at your local nursery - it's a type of mophead hydrangea that blooms more than once over the summer. This type of hydrangea produces large balls of pink or blue blossoms that deepen in color over the course of the season. The oakleaf hydrangea grows well in places with very hot summers without too much moisture. It is hardy through zone 4b/5a. This type of hydrangea has white blossoms. Annabelle hydrangeas are more cold hardy than mophead or oakleaf hydrangeas, can still grow in zone 3. This type of hydrangea has white blossoms that turn light green later in the season. Peegee hydrangeas can grow hardy even further north than Annabelles - all the way up to zone 3a. They are also able to grow in southern zones. They have white blossoms."
