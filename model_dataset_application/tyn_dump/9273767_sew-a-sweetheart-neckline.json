Measure around your bust, the distance across your chest, the desired length of the bodice extending from your armpit, and from the center of your collarbone (at the base of your neck) to the desired depth of the neckline at the center of your chest. Record each of these measurements. Keep in mind that a deeper neckline will result in more cleavage. If you want a less revealing look, then do not make your neckline too deep."

          "description":"With your fabric folded in half twice (four layers total), mark the area where you want your bodice piece to begin and end. This will be the height or length of the bodice extending from your armpit to an area on your waist. You can make the bodice any length you like. For example, if you want to use the bodice to complete an empire waist dress, then you would want a shorter bodice. If you want a fitted waist, then you would need a longer bodice."

Mark the fabric at the top and bottom of the bodice length to indicate this measurement, and then connect the two dots in a straight line going from the top to the bottom of the bodice piece. For example, if you want the neckline to be a total of 10\u201d (25 cm) wide, then your number would be 5\u201d (12.5 cm) and you would mark the fabric at this distance from the fold. Make sure to mark at the top and bottom of your bodice piece and then connect the dots to create a straight line. A wider neckline will result in a long curve, and a narrower neckline will result in a shorter, sharper curve."
