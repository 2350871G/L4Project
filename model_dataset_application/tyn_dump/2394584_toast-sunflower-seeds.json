  "text":" Microwave Toasting Spread the sunflowers seeds out in a microwave-safe dish. A microwave-safe pie plate works well, but any microwave-safe dish that is large enough to allow you to spread the seeds out on a single layer will work. Make sure the seeds are spread out evenly to prevent any from burning. Add the oil to the seeds. Drizzle the oil or melted butter over the seeds. Stir the seeds with a fork, making sure that all the seeds are coated in the oil. The oil adds flavor to the seeds and helps the seeds brown. Microwave, uncovered, for 1 minute. If you feel the need to cover the seeds to prevent oil splatters, only cover the seeds loosely with a paper towel. Stir and continue cooking. After the first minute passes, stir the seeds with a fork. Gently shake the dish to spread out the seeds and return them to a single even layer. Continue cooking the seeds for another minute. Continue cooking the seeds in 1 minute intervals. After each minute, stir and check the seeds once more. The sunflower seeds are done once they appear lightly browned. This could take anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes total. Stovetop Toasting Heat the coconut oil. Pour the oil into an 8-inch (20-cm) skillet and heat the skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Continue heating until the oil has melted and coated the bottom of the pan smoothly. Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the sunflower seeds and salt. Add the seeds to the hot coconut oil, but only do so after removing the skillet from the heat. Sprinkle the seeds with salt, to taste, and stir the seeds with a fork to coat them evenly in the salt and oil. Return the skillet to the stovetop. Keep the heat set to medium and stir the sunflower seeds constantly to prevent them from burning. Turn the heat down to low once the seeds start browning. As soon as the seeds begin to show any color, reduce the heat to low. Continue stirring them constantly until the majority of the seeds are a light to medium brown, or until they are toasted according to your preference. Soy Sauce Toasted Seeds Pour the sunflower seeds directly into a dry frying pan. The flavor provided by oil or butter is not necessary for this method of preparation since you will get plenty of flavor from the soy sauce. Oil and other fats also help the seeds to brown or toast evenly, but even toasting can still be achieved without the use of fat as long as you are vigilant enough. Heat the seeds on the stovetop over medium-high to high heat. Move the seeds around constantly with a fork. In addition to stirring the seeds, you should also give the skillet a gentle shake once or twice to help keep the seeds moving. Remove from heat as soon as the seeds begin browning. The seeds will begin to look light golden brown and may even begin to steam or smell burnt. Stir the seeds in the hot skillet. While the pan is removed from the stovetop, stir the seeds to continue the browning process. If the seeds have stopped browning but you still need to toast a few more, briefly return the pan to the heat, keeping it there just long enough to apply a little extra heat. The entire toasting process should only take a couple of minutes. Add the soy sauce. Once the seeds are toasted to a light or medium brown, add the soy sauce to the skillet. Return the skillet to the heat and stir the seeds to coat them in the soy sauce. Keep the skillet on the heat, stirring the seeds continually, until the sauce has completely coated the seeds and the remaining liquid has evaporated. Let the seeds cool. Remove the coated seeds from the heat and immediately transfer them over to a plate to cool. Enjoy at room temperature. The seeds are too hot and too sticky to eat straight from the stovetop, but after cooling, they should separate without much difficulty.",
