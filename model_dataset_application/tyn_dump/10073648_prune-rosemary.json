However, you can also begin as early as the last weeks of winter, or hold off until things start cooling off in the fall. A good rule of thumb is to schedule your last trim of the season no later than 4-6 weeks before the earliest expected frost. This will give the new growth a chance to harden off before the temperature outside plummets. Get in the habit of pruning your rosemary around the same time every year.
