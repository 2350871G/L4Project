The heat from your oven will have raised the temperature of the interior of the block, and you'll damage the block if you clean it before it's completely cool.

The tap water will rinse off any food remnants, spices, herbs, or other seasonings that may be on the surface of the block. Avoid rinsing the salt block with hot water, as the hot water will cause the salt to gradually erode. It's not necessary to use soap when you rinse the salt block, since the salt is naturally antibacterial."

Turn off the tap water, and rub a wet sponge over the cooking surface of the salt block. You should see the surface of the block lighten as you remove food stains. Do not leave the tap water running while you scrub the block. Doing so will erode the salt more quickly."

Rinse off the salt block again, using your hand to brush off any crumbs or food remnants. Keep the block under warm tap water for 15\u201320 seconds. Rinsing the block for a second time will remove any lingering food particles that otherwise would remain on the surface of the block."

If you don't have a clean cotton cloth on hand, you can use paper towels instead. If you neglect to dry the block and put it away wet, the residual water will soak into the salt and weaken its structure."

For example, keep the salt block on your counter, leaning back against the backsplash. Or, set the block on your windowsill to maximize the airflow it receives. Do not store the salt block in a damp cellar or humid pantry cabinet."

In this case, use a steel wool pad instead of the sponge when you're clearing off the salt block. Scrub the steel wool pad over the stain until it's been removed. If you don't already own a steel wool pad, you can purchase one at any large supermarket or home-supply store. They're inexpensive and should cost less than $3 USD."

Slide it forward so the edge of the blade goes under food residue that's caked on the surface of the block. If you're worried that caked-on stains may be difficult to get off once they've set, scrape them off once the salt block is cool enough to touch. Scrape off caked-on material before rinsing your salt block and scrubbing it with a sponge. Since this method of cleaning doesn't involve water, you don't need to wait 4\u20136 hours before scraping off stains. Purchase a set of razor blades and a holder (so you don't cut your fingers) at a hardware store or large home-supply store."
