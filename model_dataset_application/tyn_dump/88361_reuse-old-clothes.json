Embellishments such as zippers, studs, and glitter can jazz up a tired shirt or skirt and turn it into something new. If the hems of your pants are frayed, but they still fit you well, try cropping them into shorts. You could also turn a long skirt into a shorter skirt or a T-shirt to a crop-top. Dye can add some vibrancy to a tired garment. Try a new hue to liven up your look. Sew a contrasting pocket on an old T-shirt for an update."

You can even stuff the bear with fabric scraps of other old clothes. You can use buttons from old garments to sew eyes and a nose onto your keepsake bear. If a bear feels too ambitious, old socks actually make great dresses for dolls. Cut off the tube portion of a tall sock. (Frilly or patterned socks work best.)

Then consult this guide for detailed stitching instruction.
