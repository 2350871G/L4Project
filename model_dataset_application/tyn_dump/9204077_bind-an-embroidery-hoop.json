Tilt the fabric so that it is at a 45 degree angle and then begin wrapping the hoop. Each rotation should cover half of the fabric from the previous rotation. If you are wrapping a solid hoop, then you can begin wrapping it anywhere. If you are wrapping a hoop with a gap between two sides of the hoop, then start wrapping near the edge of the gap and wrap around to the end of the gap. If after a few rotations the fabric is not covering enough of the previous rotation or if it is covering too much, then adjust the angle of the fabric and try again."

Go all the way through the fabric underneath the end piece on the hoop. Keep sewing until you have made two passes across the edge of the end piece of fabric. Then, tie the thread in a knot and cut the excess. Gluing the fabric in place is also an option, but you will need to leave the hoop to dry overnight before using it. If you\u2019d rather use glue to secure the fabric, then place a generous dot of fabric glue under the end of the fabric and press it down. Then, place a clothespin over the end to hold it while it dries."
