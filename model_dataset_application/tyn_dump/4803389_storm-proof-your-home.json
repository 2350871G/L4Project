Opt for rot-resistant wood, like cedar or white oak, so you can use it multiple times if necessary. Calculate the area beforehand by multiplying the length and width of each window. If you don\u2019t purchase rot-resistant wood, you will also need to get a water-resistant sealer for your wood.

Wear safety glasses when working with saws so you don\u2019t get any sawdust in your eyes. Label each piece of plywood you cut out with where it will be placed.
