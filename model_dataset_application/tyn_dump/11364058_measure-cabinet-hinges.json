Take down each hinge you plan on measuring and spread them across a flat surface. Typically, all of a door\u2019s hinges are the same size, so measuring one is enough. If you have a stuck hinge due to paint buildup, cut through the paint with a utility knife. Then, use a flathead screwdriver to pry the hinge off the cabinet.
