Look for juices that are unsweetened and that don\u2019t have any added calcium. Find a recipe before going to the store to make sure you buy enough liquid. In general, you will need 3 to 4 cups (710 to 950 mL) of juice for 5 half-pints (40 ounces). If you\u2019re using juice, you can skip ahead to the \u201cAdding Sugar and Pectin\u201d section."

Look for fruit that is perfectly ripe for the best results. If you buy fruit that isn\u2019t ripe yet, wait until it is before you make your jelly. You can also pair fruits with different fresh herbs, like apricot and rosemary or strawberry and mint.

Use a clean cutting board and knife to roughly cut up the fruit. If you\u2019re using small fruits, like blueberries or grapes, you don\u2019t need to cut them up. The cutting process just prepares the fruit to release its juices faster once it boiling.
