A lovely hard-covered notebook or a quality scrapbook might be ideal.

Some of the things you might like to write about in your pet's memoir include:\nWhen you first got your pet and why you wanted the pet. Any identifiable features, quirks or personality traits of your pet that you noticed early on, or that grew over time. Describe your pet as best you can. (Images or self-made drawings might help you with this.) Interactions with other people in the household or neighborhood; interactions with other pets or animals. Eventful situations with your pet, such as rescuing the pet/the pet rescuing you or someone else; losing your pet and finding it again; showing your pet in a show; traveling with your pet; having your pet at your wedding, etc. How your pet made you feel. Did your pet help you feel better when you were down? Did your pet bring you joy even when you felt the rest of life was hard? Was your pet an important companion to you? Ways in which your pet inspired, enlightened or informed you. Things you want to always remember about your pet. Favorite activities together, such as going for walks, singing together, doing tricks, eating together, dancing, riding, etc. The circumstances surrounding your pet's death, such as its age, an illness or an accident.
