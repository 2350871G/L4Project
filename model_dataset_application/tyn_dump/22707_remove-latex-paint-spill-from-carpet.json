Always adjust the cloth so you are blotting with a clean section. Keep blotting at the stain until your cloth no longer absorbs any of the paint. Blot from the outside of the paint, moving inward; this will prevent you from spreading out the stain even further. If the stain still remains, repeat the cleaning process with the soapy water, or move on to using vinegar to blot at the paint. Vinegar works well with removing water-based paints like latex paint."
