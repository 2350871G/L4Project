    "A good idea is to run masking tape along the floor while you have the studs exposed and mark the center line of each stud with a high visibility marker.",
    "Measure the wall against a piece of drywall to determine whether its end piece will fit in the center of a stud.",
    "Again, it's likely that you will have to cut some pieces of drywall in order to center the end pieces onto a stud.",
    "When cutting drywall, use a T-square and razor knife to score a line on one side of the drywall paper.",
    "Place your knee on the opposite side of the cut and quickly pull the drywall piece towards you while at the same time pushing your knee outward, snapping the drywall in a clean line.",
    "Clean up the remaining paper along the newly formed crease with your razor.",
    "Run a bead of glue down each strapping or joist over which drywall will be placed.",
    "Do this right before you intend to hang the drywall.",
    "With help, hoist the drywall on the wall, and using the drill, install five screws in the stud at the center of the drywall panel.",
    "Start in the center and work outwards.",
    "Drive in five screws for each stud.",
    "Extra screws may help in some situations, but are usually overkill; they will require extra mudding and sanding that may detract from the overall finish.",
    "Consider using a spring-loaded drywall screw dimpler.",
    "They are designed to automatically countersink each drywall screw to precisely the same depth before ratcheting the screw bit, as a sign to quit and back off the drill.",
    "Use a drywall saw to make cuts along irregular openings such as arches.",
    "Continue installing drywall over window and door openings.",
    "You'll be able to trim off excess drywall later.",
    "At the same time, be mindful that no seams line up with a door or window corner, and do not fasten panels to framing around openings yet.",
    "A good practice when installing drywall over protruding pipes is to place the drywall against the pipe and lightly tap with a flat block of wood to dimple the back.",
    "Next, pull the drywall away and use a drywall circle cutter or drywall hole saw to cut a perfect hole along the dimple.",
    "This should be much easier to finish than if you punch out a large hole that requires 3-4 coats of mud to finish.",
    "Continue gluing, hoisting, and screwing drywall in this manner until one row of the ceiling has been completely covered.",
    "Start the next row at the edge of the wall, next to the previous row.",
    "Cut out any drywall that has been hung over window or door frames.",
    "Fasten the drywall down around the window or door, and then cut out the proper section using a rotary drill or drywall saw.",
    "Mudding and Taping Drywall Mix your initial coat of drywall compound, or mud, to the consistency of sour cream.",
    "Having the first coat of mud, which you'll apply directly over the seam, a bit runnier than normal will allow the tape to bond well with the mud.",
    "Use a drywall knife to apply a liberal amount of mud to a seam.",
    "You don't have to worry about getting it perfect the first time through; you'll wipe off the excess after you apply the tape.",
    "Make sure you cover the seam entirely.",
    "Put drywall tape over the entire joint you applied the mud to.",
    "Use your 6\" or 8\" drywall putty knife to flatten the tape, starting at one end and pulling towards you in one smooth motion.",
    "Have your drywall tape pre-cut and lightly dampened with clean water.",
    "You don't need to soak it down too much.",
    "Some contractors avoid the perforated and fiber tapes, as they don't produce a flawless finish and require gobs of extra mud and sanding to get the job done right.",
    "Do what works best for you and fits in your budget.",
    "Wipe off the mud around the tape with your drywall knife.",
    "Wipe off excess mud so the surface of the seam is smooth and flattened.",
    "Inspect your recently taped joint for air bubbles.",
    "Wet your blade and flatten then out with another swipe if needed.",
    "For corner beads, consider using a corner tool that is available for both inside and outside corners.",
    "This will give your job a professional finish.",
    "Apply mud and tape in a similar manner.",
    "Apply liberal amount of compound.",
    "If it isn't already, crease your tape perfectly in the center and reinforce the crease a couple of times.",
    "Apply the tape so that the center of the crease fits directly into the corner of the wall.",
    "Wipe away excess compound with your drywall knife.",
    "Apply at least two to three more coats using a slightly wider putty knife for each application.",
    "Let the mud dry between each coat.",
    "It will bubble if you rush it!",
    "Many thin coats of mud will give you better results, but patience is required to let it dry.",
    "Don't apply any mud over freshly taped joints.",
    "Allow them to thoroughly dry for one day between coats unless you are using hot mud that will dry in an hour.",
    "A great idea is to use pink mud that dries white, indicating it is ready for another coat.",
    "Don't forget to apply a swipe coat over each screw.",
    "You shouldn't notice any edges after screening the mud over a joint line or screw dimple.",
    "Make sure to hold the blade flat against the drywall and pull towards you in smooth but firm strokes.",
    "Practice on an old piece of drywall to refine your technique.",
    "Screed some mud over any small imperfections in the drywall that may occur during installation such as missed nail/screw holes.",
    "Repeat for each joint until all joints are taped.",
    "Sanding and Finishing Use a pole sander with drywall sandpaper to sand the hard-to-reach joints after the final coat has dried.",
    "Don't get carried away and sand until you expose the paper.",
    "This step goes quickly because the mud will sand off easily.",
    "Use a handheld drywall sander with fine-grit sandpaper to hit everything else.",
    "Again, caution is key here.",
    "A quick couple of scrapes over the joints is all you need.",
    "With a handheld light and pencil, go over any surface with compound on it and inspect for flaws.",
    "The light will help you spot imperfections.",
    "Circle any problem areas with the pencil.",
    "Use a sponge sander or hand sander to briefly hit any flawed areas.",
    "Prime the walls, then sand again.",
    "Apply a coat of primer to the walls, then sand the entire area lightly using a pole sander.",
    "Although most beginners skip this step, it's critical for getting a nice, even finish and for avoiding fuzzy paper residue and fluff left over from the initial sanding.",
    "Don't over-sand.",
    "Sanding can be satisfying and fun, but sometimes people sand unnecessarily, sanding through tape.",
    "If this happens, apply some more mud and re-sand it when it dries."
