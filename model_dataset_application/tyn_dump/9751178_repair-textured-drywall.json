    "This style is mainly popular in:\nArizona\nNew Mexico\nTexas\nCalifornia\nNevada.",
    "Learn to recognize the circular pattern of a swirl drywall texture.",
    "This texture is made by moving a knife in circular motions, creating a collection of semi-circles across the wall or ceiling.",
    "Familiarize with the floral shape of the rosebud drywall texture.",
    "It is made by applying very thin layers of drywall and stamping the drywall with a brush.",
    "This texture is popular because it is easy to apply and creates a fun texture.",
    "Look for a dimpled surface pattern if you have orange peel texture.",
    "Your walls will look just like its name, resembling the slightly textured yet smooth surface.",
    "Orange peel drywall is a very popular texture because it provides durability.",
    "Recognize the splatter knockdown texture by its small spatters.",
    "The splatter knockdown texture is created by spraying layers of drywall and using a knife to smooth down some of the paint globs.",
    "Look for thick, puffy textures if you have popcorn texture.",
    "This texture is also very popular, though it has a unique appearance based on what is added to the drywall mix.",
    "It creates a raised, puffy appearance on the walls.",
    "This used to be popular in the 1970s-1990s and is not well received in modern homes.",
    "Use hand tools to repair textures like skip trowel, Santa Fe, swirl, and rosebud.",
    "These textures are created using drywall knives or brushes, and are relatively easy to complete.",
    "Use a spray hopper to repair orange peel, splatter knockdown, or popcorn drywall textures.",
    "These textures will require some equipment to spray on the texture.",
    "Using Hand Tools Dip a paintbrush or drywall knife into your drywall mix.",
    "Dunk your brush 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) into the paint, and wipe off any extra drywall mix.",
    "Your brush or knife should be thoroughly saturated but not with too much mix.",
    "Apply a light, even layer by wiping your brush across the repair area.",
    "This will create your first layer of textured drywall.",
    "You want an even, smooth layer across the repair area \nIf there is any extra drywall mix, wipe it away with your brush or knife.",
    "Create your original texture with your brush or knife.",
    "You are looking to repair the existing texture you created initially, so mimic the same application process you first made.",
    "Remember to dip your brush back into your drywall mixture as needed.",
    "For the skip trowel texture, angle your knife when you apply the drywall so the drywall will skill across the surface and leave behind a texture.",
    "For the Santa Fe texture, apply 2 smooth layers with a rounded knife.",
    "When you apply the top layer, let some of the bottom layer show through to create this texture.",
    "For a swirl texture, move your brush in circular motions, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.",
    "You should match your motions to the directions of the circles you created the first time.",
    "For the rosebud texture, apply 1 thin layer of drywall mix with your knife, and then take a soft bristled brush and stamp it onto your wall.",
    "The spread bristles will create flower-like patterns.",
    "Apply another layer of drywall mixture to thicken up your texture.",
    "If your drywall texture is not thick enough, apply another layer using the technique of your choice to add depth.",
    "Wait 24 hours for your drywall to dry.",
    "Smaller areas may take less time to dry, though waiting 1 full day ensures your drywall is completely dry.",
    "Finish your textured drywall with a layer of paint if you used it initially.",
    "Paint over your textured drywall once it dries to match the color of your walls.",
    "Apply 1 or 2 coats, as needed.",
    "Using a Hand-Held Spray Hopper Rent or purchase a spray hopper from a home repair store.",
    "You can rent these by the hour, by the day, or per week.",
    "Attach your spray gun to an air compressor.",
    "The air compressor will make your drywall mixture spray out of the spray nozzle, so connect it to the gun.",
    "Read the user manual for detailed instructions.",
    "It should easily fit into the back of the spray gun.",
    "Fill the hopper with your drywall mixture.",
    "You can pour the drywall mixture directly into the hopper.",
    "The amount doesn\u2019t have to be exact, though it is helpful to fill it close to the top for a large area.",
    "For smaller repairs, just dump in a little bit.",
    "Test your air pressure and aperture width to experiment with effects.",
    "You want your air pressure to be around 25 to 45 PSI.",
    "You can test this by spraying onto a scrap of wood, or a piece of cardboard.",
    "When you have achieved the look you want, make a note of what PSI and aperture you used.",
    "Lower pressure will not spray the drywall mixture evenly, and higher pressure will make it hard to control the amount sprayed.",
    "A large aperture will create large blobs, and a small aperture will create fine texture.",
    "You can adjust this based on the look you are created.",
    "For example, you may want a small aperture for creating the \u201corange peel\u201d look.",
    "Spray a thin, even layer of drywall mix over top the repair area.",
    "Hold in the trigger to release the drywall, and move your sprayer in a wide, sweeping motion.",
    "You want to use a light touch and go back over with multiple layers, rather than applying too think of a layer.",
    "If you pause too long in one spot, you will create heavy deposits of drywall.",
    "You can spray horizontally, from left to right, or vertically, from top to bottom, based on the location of your drywall repair.",
    "Add more layers of drywall based on your intended texture.",
    "Keep in mind that you are trying to apply your texture as uniform as you can.",
    "Create an \u201corange peel\u201d texture by gradually building up layers to create a splotchy appearance.",
    "Make the \u201cSplatter Knockdown\u201d texture by using a spray gun with two tubes rather than just one.",
    "This will apply more drywall at once to build up the texture.",
    "Then, use a drywall knife to \u201cknock down\u201d the drywall once it has set lightly.",
    "Add styrofoam to your drywall mud mixture to create a popcorn texture.",
    "Spray 1 thick, even layer using your spray hopper.",
    "Let your drywall dry for at least 24 hours.",
    "After 24 hours, your drywall should be thoroughly dry and ready for a coat of paint.",
    "Add a fresh coat of paint to finish your drywall if applicable.",
    "Paint over your textured drywall to match the color of your walls.",
    "Apply 1 or 2 coats, as needed."
