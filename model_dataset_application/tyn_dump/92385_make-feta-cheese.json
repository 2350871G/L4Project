The milk will look gelled and some of the whey, or liquid, will have separated. Insert a clean finger or knife into the curd and slowly pull it out to see how the curd breaks. The curd should split neatly and the whey should look opaque. Draining and Molding the Cheese Curds Cut the curd into roughly \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) cubes. Start at one side and cut straight down to the bottom with a long-bladed knife. Make a rough grid pattern of cubes in the curd. The cheese curds will move around as you cut them, so don\u2019t worry about making each one a perfect cube. Reach to the bottom with a clean hand and gently lift the curds to stir.

Line a strainer with cheesecloth or a sterile handkerchief. Place it above a bowl or container and let all the whey strain out for 2-4 hours. You can let the whey strain out either at room temperature or in the fridge. Save the drained whey in the bowl or container. Place the drained curds into a bowl and mix in 1/2 tsp (2 g) of salt. Break up the cheese curds as you mix in the salt. Mix it thoroughly with clean hands until all of the curds are broken up and the salt is evenly distributed. Press the cheese into a mold lined with cheesecloth. Place the curds inside, fold over the ends of the cloth, place the end on top, and place a weight on top of that. Let it sit overnight. To make a homemade cheese mold, cut the ends out of a smooth-sided 4 x 5 inch tin and save one of the cut ends. You can use a sterile handkerchief instead of cheesecloth in the mold. Brining and Storing the Feta Prepare pickling whey brine and let it sit for 12-24 hours. Mix 20 oz (591 ml) of the whey that you saved with 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of salt and stir to dissolve. Let the whey brine sit out at room temperature, covered, for 12-24 hours to make it acidic. The brine must be acidic or else the cheese will melt on the surface. Cut the cheese into 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) cubes and put them in a wide jar. Place the cheese on cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it evenly. Leave a bit of space at the top of the jar because you will cover the cheese with brine. A mason jar is a good option for storing your homemade feta.
