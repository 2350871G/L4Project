If you do not have a slide available, you can measure the drawer or cabinet from front to back. The standard slide length is 14 in (36 cm). However, deeper cabinets will have longer slides. Fitting the Slides on the Drawer Align the smaller slide against the bottom of the drawer. Lay the drawer on its side. The slide needs to be flush against the drawer\u2019s bottom edge. The slide\u2019s thicker, squared end should be flush with the drawer\u2019s front edge. Undermount slides attach to the bottom of the drawer, one each on the left and right edges.

Attach the slide on the other side of the drawer. Find the other small slide piece. Flip the drawer over so the other side is facing up. Then, line up and attach the other slide the same way you did with the first one. Setting up the Slide Tracks Set the back brackets in the slide frame. Find the L-shaped metal brackets as well as the 2 remaining slide pieces. Fit a bracket into 1 end on each slide. The brackets easily slide into the frame track. The free ends of the brackets will attach to the cabinets with screws. To make sure the bracket is placed correctly, test the frame pieces by fitting them inside the cabinet. Align the slide frames with the bottom of the cabinet. Place the slide frame pieces inside the cabinet. Push the brackets all the way to the back. The frame pieces should be flush with the bottom edge of the cabinet and rest against the side walls. If you are using undermount or center mount slides, place the frame pieces on the cabinet\u2019s bottom. Use a level to straighten the frames. The frames need to be level from front to back. To check this, set a carpenter\u2019s level on top of the frame. Reposition each frame as needed until the leveling tool is even from left to right. When using a bubble level, for instance, the bubble will move to the center of the level. Mark the position of the frames with a pencil. Mark where the frames rest on the cabinet. You can draw directly onto the cabinet with a pencil. Create the lines right over the ends of both frames. Then, mark the spots where the brackets and rails will be screwed in place. Each bracket has 2 screw holes to mark. The rails will have at least 1 hole at the opposite ends. Make sure the lines are dark enough to see as you secure the rails. Predrill holes into the wood. Drill into the spots you marked earlier. These holes prevent the screws from breaking or cracking the wood. Use a drill bit about \u20443 in (1.7 cm) wide to create holes about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) deep. Screw the frame pieces in place. Set 2 \u20442 in (1.3 cm) screws in each bracket. Use an electric screwdriver to secure the frame to the cabinet. Then, set another screw in the front end of the bracket to secure the slide in place. Gently install the screws and avoid making them too tight. Fit the drawer into the cabinet\u2019s slide frames. Line the drawer\u2019s slide rails up with the cabinet\u2019s rail frames. The drawer\u2019s slides should fit in the frames. Push the drawer in to make sure it glides smoothly. If the pieces are installed correctly, the drawer will come to a gentle stop inside the cabinet.
