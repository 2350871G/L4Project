If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can use a blender or mortar and pestle to make the pesto. Mix in the cheese and ramps. Once the garlic and nuts are crushed, add 3 tablespoons (15 g) of grated pecorino romano cheese and the chopped ramp leaves to food processor.

Add the oil a tablespoon at a time until the pesto reaches the proper consistency.
