Look for plum tomatoes that are bright red and firm to the touch. Do not use overly ripe tomatoes as they contain a lot of liquid and will water down the pico de gallo. If plum tomatoes aren't available at your grocery store, dry-farmed tomatoes are another good option. Use a sharp knife to dice the tomatoes into small cubes."

The sharp taste balances out nicely with the tomatoes in the pico de gallo. If you can only find red or green onions, feel free to use them instead. Place the diced onions in a bowl and add the juice of half the lime to them. The acid in the lime will tame some of the sharpness in the onions."
