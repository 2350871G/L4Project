    "The drying time may vary depending on the weather.",
    "Humid conditions can prevent the paint from drying as quickly as normal.",
    "Coat the fence in a second layer of paint.",
    "Once the first layer has dried, go back over the entire fence again.",
    "Work on 1 section at a time, moving the brush in slow, even strokes.",

    "Placing Decorative Items on the Fence Choose similar decorations to create a theme.",
    "Any decorations you hang need to complement each other.",
    "Usually, you want sets of decorations that have the same function and are made from similar materials.",
    "Color-matching is a plus.",
    "Slapping wildly different decorations on your fence looks sloppy and detracts from uniformity.",
    "Most hanging decorations can be removed from the fence easily and replaced if you decide they don\u2019t fit.",
    "Plan out where you will hang the decorations.",
    "Sketch a basic outline of where each decoration will go.",
    "You can mark these spots in pencil, especially if you plan on putting screws or nails into the fence.",

    "Icicle lights are a popular option, especially around some holidays.",
    "Hang garlands and wreaths around fence posts.",
    "Tie material around fence posts to easily hide them under colorful fabric.",
    "Garlands are way to spruce up fences for a holiday celebration.",

    "Nail hurricane lights to the fence.",
    "Hurricane lights are basically small lanterns.",
    "Set nails in the fence where you want to the hang the lights.",
    "Set the light\u2019s hook over the nail.",

    "You can also screw these to the fence.",
    "To make them easier to remove, consider installing a small mounting board first.",
    "Wrap plastic ties around the fence to make an image.",
    "For chain link fences, a unique way to color them is by wrapping materials around them.",
    "Pick up plastic cable ties from a home improvement store.",
    "Wrap the ties tightly around the chain links.",
    "Bunch them together to make unique art, such as a fish, heart, or letters.",
    "Other material can be used instead of ties.",
    "If you crochet or knit, wrap yarn around the links or tie a finished design to the fence."
