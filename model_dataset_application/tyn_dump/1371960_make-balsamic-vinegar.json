If you don\u2019t have a sealable jar, pour the olive oil and balsamic vinegar into a small bowl. The jar or similar container will be shaken, making it important that the seal is tight and secure.

Moving the liquid to a new barrel each time 10% of it evaporates is what gives it a unique flavor, so if you don't have multiple barrels, your balsamic vinegar may not have the best taste possible. The size barrels you use will depend on how much liquid (grape juice) you have to begin with."
