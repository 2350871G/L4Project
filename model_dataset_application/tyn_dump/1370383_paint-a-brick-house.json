For tougher dirt and salt deposits, use a stiff-bristled brush dipped in a soap water mixture. If this isn't doing the trick, mix \u20442 cup (120 mL) of trisodium phosphate into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to create a cleaning solution and dip your brush into it before scrubbing the brick. Apply a solution of 1 part bleach and 3 parts water to mildew and let it sit for 30 minutes. Afterward, scrub the surface with a wire brush. Consider renting a 1500 PSI pressure washer from a home improvement store for larger areas of brick. Never clean brick with acid cleaning solutions or you might ruin the paint job."

Cut your caulking tube at a 45-degree angle, taking care to keep the hole size small \u2013 no further down than \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). Insert the tube into your caulking gun, hold the release trigger, and pull the steel rod back as far as you can. Now, press the trigger and move the tip steadily through the crack until it's filled. Allow the caulk to dry for about 5 hours. Press the caulk flat into the cracks with a putty knife to even it with the wall. Be sure to move the gun in steady motions. If you move too fast, the caulk will be thin and uneven, but if you move too slow it will be clumpy and difficult to work with."

Aim your roll upwards at a small angle while applying light pressure. Once you reach 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the top of the wall, roll up and down while moving back to the corner. Continue moving from the floor to the top and always move \u00be the width of the roller so each stroke overlaps. Continue rolling until all of the bricks are covered.
