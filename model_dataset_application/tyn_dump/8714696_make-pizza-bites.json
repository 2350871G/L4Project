As you are doing this, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (204.5\u00b0C). A regular muffin pan is okay to use as well if you don\u2019t have a mini muffin pan. Cut the pizza dough. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Cut the dough into 24 triangles. The triangles should be around the same size as if you were using a round glass or cookie cutter, but with three pointed edges. Put each triangle into a cup in the muffin pan. Leave two ends of the triangles sticking out of the pan so that you can remove them from the pan easier later on.

Allow them to cool for a few minutes and serve warm. Cover the leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for no longer than a few days. Cooking Deep Dish Pizza Bites Preheat the oven and spray the pan. Turn the oven to 425\u00b0F (218.3\u00b0C). Get out a regular muffin pan while the oven is preheating. Spray the muffin pan with non-stick baking spray. Prepare the dough. Take the pizza dough out of the refrigerator. Let it warm to room temperature on a floured surface.

Cover the leftovers with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and leave them in the refrigerator for longer than a few days. Choosing a Gluten-Free Option Grate the cauliflower. Take the large head of cauliflower and use a box grater to grate it into fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs into a large bowl. While you\u2019re preparing the ingredients, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (204.5\u00b0C).
