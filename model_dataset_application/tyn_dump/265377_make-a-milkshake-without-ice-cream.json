  "text":" Making a Blender Milkshake Measure out 2 cups (475 ml) milk, 1 tsp (5 g) vanilla extract, and chocolate syrup (if desired). Put them into a blender and mix for 15-20 seconds. This circulates the air. The thicker the milk you use (2%, for example) the thicker your milkshake will be. Put 3/4 cup (100 g) sugar into the blender. Blend for 5 - 10 seconds more. Add the ice. This will work best with pre-crushed ice. Watch it as it blends -- if it blends too much, it will get quite runny. Serve and enjoy. Consume immediately -- it's best when cold and the ice still gives it texture. Making a Milkshake in a Bag Take a small plastic bag and fill it with milk. It needs to be resealable above all else. Put a teaspoon of sugar in the milk. Lightly stir to combine. Add a few drops of vanilla extract/essence into the bag. Stir the vanilla in thoroughly. Fill the big bag up halfway with ice. It needs to be able to contain a smaller bag and be sealed. A gallon-sized resealable bag is ideal. Put the bag with the mixture in the bigger bag. The ice is simply to get the chemical reactions going -- you won't be consuming it. It will remain separate from the milk mixture. Add 1/4 teaspoon of salt into the bigger bag. This has to do with exothermic reactions and is an imperative step to your mixture thickening! Shake for about 5-7 minutes, or until mushy like a milkshake. It requires vigorous shaking for the mixture to thicken. If 7 minutes have passed and it's not thick enough, shake it for a few more. Open up the small bag and pour it into a cup. Enjoy your shake! Making a Crushed Ice Milkshake Add the ingredients to the blender. If using fruit, chop into small enough pieces. Blend until all the ingredients are well mixed.  Add crushed ice. Blend again to mix thoroughly. Pour into the glass. The crushed ice will make the milkshake both cold and texturally thick.",
