In subsequent years, it will produce an ever-larger bush of flowers. The first time you trim lavender, during its second year of growth, you may only get a handful of stalks. By year 3 or 4, you should have 5 - 8 bunches of lavender you can use to dry and use or display."

You can wait a few weeks after the flower buds open to enjoy them in your garden, but by the time you trim them, the oils won't be as strong.

Taking this precaution will help ensure that the plant doesn't pick up a bacterial disease. You should also make sure the shears are very sharp so that they make a clean cut that will heal over quickly. Avoid using craft scissors to trim lavender. They don't make a clean enough cut. Bypass pruners are your best option. These are spring-loaded with two curved blades."

Trim them back so that 1/3 of the length of the stems is left on the shrub. If your shrub is on the older side, you'll likely have to cut more than one bunch.

To hang your lavender to dry, use a rubber band to tie the stems together. Hang the lavender bunch upside-down in a cool, dry spot. Allow it to dry for a week or two. Drying lavender this way preserves its color and scent. To dry your lavender in the sun, lay it flat on a screen, and set the screen in a sunny spot. The lavender will dry over the course of 5 days or so. Lavender dried in the sun tends to fade to a lighter color."
