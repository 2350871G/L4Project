You should determine which flowers will not clash with the colors in the room you choose for your arrangement or with the attire of the person holding the bouquet. If you are arranging a bridal bouquet for someone who wants to wear a green dress, red flowers (which is the complementary\u2014opposite\u2014color of green) might create an overly intense effect."

For a multicolored scheme, you have more options, but you should avoid colors that clash with one another. For a monochromatic scheme based on red, you could go completely with red roses or mix it up with pink and light purple flowers. Sunflowers and violets might clash with each other if you don\u2019t add colors that will offset the yellow and deep purple."

The blooms should be able to fit tightly against one another when arranged."

Make sure the flowers are newly cut so that they will last as long as possible. Flowers that haven\u2019t bloomed yet are also a good choice. Although organic flowers are more expensive, they are a safer choice.
