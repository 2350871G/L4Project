Clip right above those so that they stay on your plant and make it easier for it to create new branches. Always clip at an angle so that water doesn\u2019t pool on top of where you cut.

Limelight hydrangeas in particular are great at coming back from huge chops, and your plant will have no problem recovering from being cut down like this.
