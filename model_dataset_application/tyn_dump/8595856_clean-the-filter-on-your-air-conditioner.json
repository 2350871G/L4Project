Mix one part vinegar and one part water. For instance, you might mix five cups of water and five cups of vinegar. Pour the mixture in a tub or a wide sink that can accommodate your filter. Submerge your filter in the mixture for at least one hour. If it is exceptionally grimy, leave it in for two hours or more. Drain the water and vinegar solution and dry the filter on a rack. Replace it when dry. Instead of water and vinegar, you could mix a small amount of detergent or liquid dish soap into a volume of water that will cover your filter when it is submerged."

Do not use a pressurized hose nozzle or you might risk tearing or damaging the flimsy filter. You could also hose your filter down in your shower. Just prop the filter up in your shower and, using your shower\u2019s detachable showerhead, spray the filter\u2019s entire surface, front and back, in a zig-zag motion. After hosing your filter down, allow it to dry, then replace it. For added effect, you could sprinkle a few spoonfuls of baking soda over your filter before spraying it down."

If your air conditioner has such a feature, set it to clean your filter regularly."

If you have a window-mounted air conditioner, you\u2019ll need to blow compressed air in short bursts at the back end of the unit (the part of the air conditioner that sticks out the window). Alternately, use a soft-bristled brush to scrub between the grating of the air conditioner\u2019s intake. Be careful not to bend any of the coil fins. If you want to clean the condenser coils of your large central air conditioner unit outside, remove its outer case, then blow compressed air across its surface in short bursts. You could also choose to use an industrial-strength vacuum fitted with a soft-bristle brush attachment to suck the grime and dirt from where it has collected between the coils."
