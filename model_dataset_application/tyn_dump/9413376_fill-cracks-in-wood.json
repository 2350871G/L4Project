  "text":" Using Wood Putty or Filler Sticks Purchase a filler compound that\u2019s the same color as the wood. Look for crayon-shaped wood filler sticks or wood putty. These products, purchased from home improvement stores or ordered online, come in a variety of colors. Pick the one that blends in best with the wood you\u2019re treating. If you can\u2019t find the exact shade you need, you can buy different colors and mix them together to create different shades. If you wish to color the wood later, make sure the label says the product is stainable. It\u2019ll take on the color of the stain, blending in with the wood. Push the filler into the hole with your finger. If you\u2019re using a filler stick, simply rub the stick over the crack. You can then use your finger to spread it more as needed. When using putty, a putty knife or chisel can help spread the material over the crack. Overfill the crack with filler material. Continue applying filler until it comes out the top of the crack. When you smooth and sand the filler later, it\u2019ll blend the crack more effectively because of the overfill. Smooth the filler with a putty knife. Before the material dries on the wood, flatten it out as much as possible. If you don\u2019t have a putty knife, run a clean rag or your finger over the crack. Make sure the rag is clean to avoid introducing debris. Let the wood filler dry for 8 hours. The amount of time needed for the filler material to dry depends on the product, so check the label for the recommended wait time. To be safe, leaving the wood alone for 8 hours or overnight will ensure the filler dries completely. Sand down the excess filler. Blend the cracked area with a plane or fine grit sandpaper.

When finished, the crack shouldn\u2019t stand out as a discolored patch. Filling Cracks with Glue and Sawdust Get sawdust that matches the type and color of your wood. Sawdust is used to cover the white glue and blend the crack, so it needs to match the wood you\u2019re treating as much as possible. For the best blend, get some sawdust from the wood by sawing or sanding it. When this isn\u2019t possible, purchase a bag of sawdust from a home improvement store. Squeeze wood glue into the crack.

Go over the crack with a piece of fine grit sandpaper that's between 120 and 220 grit. Carefully rub down the treated area until the filler is flat and unnoticeable. Fixing Cracks with Epoxy Wear a respirator mask and work in a well-ventilated area. Epoxy isn\u2019t something you want to breathe in, so stay safe by putting on a mask before you begin. Working outdoors is your safest option, and make sure pets and family members aren\u2019t near your work area. Cover the crack with masking tape if it goes through the wood.
