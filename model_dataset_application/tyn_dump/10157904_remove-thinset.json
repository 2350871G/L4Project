This decreases its integrity and makes it much easier to remove using a putty knife. Purchase 0.39 gallon (1.5 L) cooking pots from home hardware stores. Pots that are 0.39 gallons (1.5 L) in size will cover a region of approximately 107.639 square feet (10.0000 m). Add 1 cup (240 ml) of citrus degreaser or vinegar to your pot to help weaken the thinset."

Flip the knife over and repeat this motion with the motion side of the blade. Continue this process until your knife is sharp enough to consistently remove thinset. Use a coarse stone for sharpening first. If your knife still needs sharpening afterward, use a fine stone. Apply 1 drop of sharpening or honing oil to the surface of the stone and rub it in with your finger prior to sharpening. These products can be purchased at home hardware stores. Between the 2 stones, the grit range should be 325 (coarse) to 1200 (extra fine)."
