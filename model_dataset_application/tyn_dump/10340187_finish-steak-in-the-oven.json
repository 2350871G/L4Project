Spread the seasonings out over the entire steak, then flip it over and season the other side the same way. Season the steak with salt only if you can wait 40 minutes or plan on cooking the steak right away. Adding the salt at the wrong time can prevent you from getting a good sear on the meat."

Spread rubs over the steak by hand and use a basting brush to help you coat it with a marinade. For Montreal steak seasoning, combine salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, red pepper flakes, thyme, dill, and coriander. A Tex-Mex rub can be made by combining black pepper, ancho chili powder, cumin, paprika, mustard, coriander, oregano, and lime zest. Combine Hoisin, sriracha, toasted sesame oil, garlic, scallions, and white vinegar for a spicy Asian-inspired marinade."

It then cooks more evenly, allowing you to create that kind of blissful, brown sear you would get at a restaurant. If you seasoned the steak with salt, consider giving it at least 40 minutes to rest so it reabsorbs any juices drawn out by the salt. If the steak feels moist after you let it rest, pat it dry with paper towels before cooking it. This can happen when you don\u2019t give it enough time to absorb the salt."
