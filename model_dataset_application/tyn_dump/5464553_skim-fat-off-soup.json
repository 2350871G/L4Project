You\u2019ll start to see the fat particles floating or foaming towards the top of the stockpot. Don\u2019t allow the soup to continue at a rolling boil. Boiling soup over high heat melts the fat, meaning it will blend into the broth. This makes it harder to remove."

          "description":"Submerge a long-handled ladle or wooden spoon into the center of the pot. Stir it around to get the simmering liquid swirling in a circle. The stirring movements will cause the oily foam and globules to migrate to the outside edges of the stockpot."

          "headline":"Scoop up the foaming fat with a fine mesh skimming utensil.",
          "description":"Once the oils start to foam up and float on the top of the soup, dip the edge of the shallow skimming utensil just below the surface of the soup. Then lift it upwards quickly to scoop up the foam and fat. You\u2019ll see some of the foamy fat stuck to the inside of the mesh. Continue scooping up the fat until there\u2019s enough collected in the mesh to discard. Dunk the mesh skimmer in a bowl of water or rinse it off under running water to remove the fat residue. This method works particularly well for skimming chicken stock."

          "headline":"Use the back of a cold metal spoon if you don\u2019t have a mesh skimming utensil.",
          "description":"Place a handful of ice cubes into a deep metal spoon or ladle to chill it down. Keep the ice cubes in the spoon while you touch the back of the spoon to the surface of the soup. Glide the back of the spoon gently across the fatty globules. The fat will solidify and stick onto the back of the spoon. Lift up the spoon and discard any fat that\u2019s stuck to the bottom. When the cold metal touches the hot soup, the fat that has gathered near the surface will quickly coagulate onto the spoon so you can peel it off. Wipe off the fat onto a paper towel and repeat the process to remove all of the fat. You must use a metal spoon for this method. A wooden or plastic spoon won\u2019t get as cold. Don\u2019t submerge the whole spoon into the soup. Just hold it parallel to the surface of the liquid while the fat gathers on the back of the spoon."

Feel free to leave it at room temperature while you cool and strain the broth. If you\u2019re making a bone broth, follow the same process to remove and discard the bones. To speed up the separating process, cook the soup with a double-layered pasta pot. Insert the strainer layer before adding your ingredients. Everything will be submerged in the stock while you cook the soup, but you can lift out the inner strainer to remove just the chunky pieces. Allow the stock to drain out into the bottom pot."

Set the pitcher aside for 5 minutes or until most of the fat has risen to the top of the soup. Then pour the broth back into the stockpot or a serving bowl. The liquid should pass through the spout and the fat should remain trapped inside the pitcher. These tools can be found at specialty cookware shops and online retailers. They look like a large measuring jug with a spout extending out from the bottom. A bottom-draining fat separator works in a similar way.

Arrange the towel as a lining within a sturdy colander. Place the colander within another stockpot or deep serving bowl. Then, carefully pour the broth through the towel-lined colander and into the pot. The fat globules will solidify and stick to the cold towel as the rest of the soup runs into the stockpot. Choose a stockpot or serving bowl with plenty of space below the bottom of the colander. If it\u2019s too shallow, the soup will fill up around the colander and it won\u2019t strain properly. You can also try this technique with a cold, damp coffee filter instead of a cloth towel."

Submerge a long-handled ladle or wooden spoon into the center of the pot. Stir it around to get the simmering liquid swirling in a circle. The stirring movements will cause the oily foam and globules to migrate to the outside edges of the stockpot. Scoop up the foaming fat with a fine mesh skimming utensil.

Then lift it upwards quickly to scoop up the foam and fat. You\u2019ll see some of the foamy fat stuck to the inside of the mesh.
