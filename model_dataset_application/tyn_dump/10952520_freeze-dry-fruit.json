However, you could also use bananas, kiwis, mango, pineapple, citrus, or just about anything else you might wish to enjoy in the future. Foods that contain lots of moisture tend to be the easiest to work with. When you freeze them, they become icy, which helps preserve their structure as the moisture slowly evaporates. Fruits are some of the simplest foods to dehydrate, which makes them a perfect place to start if you\u2019re just getting into freeze-drying."

When you\u2019re done, pat the fruit dry with a layer of folded paper towels or a clean, dry towel. It\u2019s important to dry your fruit thoroughly before moving on. Starting with wet fruit will increase the amount of ice that has to evaporate in the freezer, causing the dehydrating process to take longer."

It\u2019s alright if the edges are touching, but try not to crowd the baking sheet, as this can lead to sticking. More space means better airflow, and better airflow means shorter freezing times. Feel free to group together as many varieties as you like on a single pan. Just organize your offerings into sections to make them easier to sort and store later on. You can also lay out your fruit on a metal cooling or drying rack, as long as the pieces are large enough not to slip through the gaps."

If you\u2019re working with drier fruits or an assortment of different varieties, be prepared to leave them for several weeks, or even as long as a month. As the fruit sits, the ice it contains will gradually turn to vapor and dissipate in a process known as \u201csublimation.\u201d\nAvoid checking on your fruit for the first week or opening the freezer door any more than absolutely necessary. Raising the temperature in the freezer even a few degrees can add considerably to your overall processing time.Tip: To test whether your fruit is fully dehydrated, grab a piece and allow it to thaw.

Make room for these containers in your refrigerator or freezer or put them away on a shelf in your pantry. When stored properly and insulated from moisture, freeze-dried fruit can last for decades! Avoid letting your freeze-dried fruit sit out on your countertops. The high humidity and fluctuating temperatures in your kitchen could cause it to go bad at a much faster rate."

    "Store your freeze-dried fruit at room temperature or below.",
    "Carefully remove the bags from the cooler and organize them on a shelf in your pantry.",
    "You can also move them into the refrigerator or freezer to make sure they stay below 68\u201370 \u00b0F (20\u201321 \u00b0C), which is optimal for maximizing the lifespan of freeze-dried items.",
    "Using a Freeze-Drying Machine Invest in a home freeze-drying machine.",
    "Nowadays, there are many companies that sell freeze-drying machines that take the difficulty out of dehydrating various foods at home.",
    "One of these machines could make a welcome addition to your kitchen if freeze-drying is a common part of your food prep routine.",
    "Freeze-drying machines come with a pretty steep price tag\u2014they can range from $1,700 for a basic unit to around $4,000 for high-end models.",
    "When deciding whether or not to make the investment, consider how much time and labor you\u2019re likely to save by using a freeze-drying machine in place of other, less efficient methods.",
    "Lay out your fruit on the provided freezing trays.",
    "Cut large fruits into chunks, slices, or wedges to ensure that they\u2019ll fit comfortably and dehydrate properly.",
    "Separate the individual pieces of fruit to prevent them from sticking together.",
    "Designate a tray for each of the fruits you\u2019ll be freeze-drying, or group different selections together on the same tray to save time.Tip: Make sure none of your pieces are taller than the sides of the trays.",
    "Oddly-shaped or overly bulky items could impact freezing times.",
    "Load the trays into the machine and press start.",
    "It\u2019s that simple!",
    "Most freeze-drying machines only have one main freezing mode, so there\u2019s no need to mess with a lot of complicated settings.",
    "Once you start the machine, the door will lock and a timer will appear displaying how long your items have left.",
    "Depending on the model you\u2019re using, you may need to run through a short checklist of preliminary tasks before you can activate the machine.",
    "This might include securing a removable insulation pad and closing the built-in drain valve.",
    "Keep your freeze-dried fruit at room temperature or cooler.",
    "When your fruit is ready to come out, unlock and open the door of the machine, remove the trays, and transfer the fruit to resealable plastic bags or lidded jars or storage containers.",
    "Stash the containers in your refrigerator or freezer, or situate them on a shelf in your pantry until you\u2019re ready to put them to use.",
    "Consider spending a little extra on a vacuum-sealer to keep your freeze-dried fruit good for longer.",
    "One of these devices will help protect it from atmospheric moisture while it\u2019s in storage."
