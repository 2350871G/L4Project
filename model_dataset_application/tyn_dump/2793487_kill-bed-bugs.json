A professional steamer session can range in price from $300 to $1200. Steaming takes a long time to complete, and the temperature of the steam must reach 71 to 82 degrees Celcius (160 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit). One of the most effective treatments is the use of a whole room heating system. Industrial heaters heat the air inside an entire space to a temperature between 49 and 57 degrees Celcius (120 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit). Ask your pest management professional if your beds and furniture must be stripped or moved before the company's arrival. Some companies will ask you to do so, while others like to inspect the items first. Note that turning up the heat in your home will not accomplish the same results as a professional heating session."
