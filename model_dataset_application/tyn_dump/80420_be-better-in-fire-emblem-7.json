    "For example: If facing multiple units of the same weapon types, Brigands, for example, units with a weapon triangle advantage and high avoid such as Guy, Raven or Lyn can be placed on defensive terrain and hold them off.",
    "It can make a huge difference.",

    "Some weapons deal 2x effective damage against certain unit types, doubling the weapons strength.",
    "For example, all bows deal effective damage against fliers, so make sure to keep your fliers out of range from enemy archers.",
    "Be sure to use this to your advantage if you're having trouble with a certain tougher enemy.",
    "Use healing items when necessary.",
    "These can come in handy if there isn't a healer nearby.",
    "But they should never be your main way of healing after gaining staff users!",
    "They also uses up that unit's turn (unless the unit is mounted, in that case the unit can move their remaining tiles) so be careful!",
    "Perfecting Your Strategies Do your maths.",
    "Don't attack a boss with someone if they'll be killed by them during enemy phase!",
    "Con is also a very important stat as it determines whether or not a unit will receive a speed penalty from a weapon.",
    "If a unit's con is equal to or higher than a weapon's weight, no speed will be deducted.",
    "However, if a unit's con is lesser, a unit will lose speed equivalent to the difference of the weapon's con and their total speed.",
    "If a unit's speed is high enough, the speed penalty won't affect their ability to double attack.",
    "You don't always have to attack or use an item, sometimes it's better to select wait so the unit can attack on enemy phase and in turn lose less health.",
    "Use support conversations.",
    "The handy conversations will up the supported unit's stats in battle by a small or large amount depending on the support level.",
    "Sure, they do boost a unit's hit and avoid and sometimes damage.",
    "But the bonuses are bonuses for a reason -- they're small.",
    "Like WTA, it is a nice bonus to have that may balance the odds in your favor, but they aren't necessary to complete the game.",
    "Use terrain to your advantage.",
    "Remember that terrain can increase your avoid rate, defense, and can even heal health each turn.",
    "A lot of bosses are on some defensive terrain of some sort.",
    "Remember to check for terrain and use it, as well as remembering to factor it into your calculations.",
