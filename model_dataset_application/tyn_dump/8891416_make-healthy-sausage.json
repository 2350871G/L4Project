Since you\u2019ll be handling raw meat, you\u2019ll want to wear gloves or wash your hands thoroughly before and after the process.

It will help to portion out your dry ingredients in advance so you\u2019ll be able to dump them into the meat all at once. Make the flavor of your sausage pop by including more intense spices like mustard, sage or cayenne pepper. A traditional breakfast sausage seasoning can be made by blending salt, black pepper, sage, cloves, marjoram and a hint of brown sugar. For spicy Italian-style sausage, season with a dash of salt, black pepper, garlic powder, dried onion, parsley and dried red pepper flakes."

Once the spices have been evenly incorporated, separate the meat into golf-ball sized chunks, then smooth them flat into patties. You can also press the sausage into casings, if you have a grinder at home. Don\u2019t pat the meat out too thick, or it will be difficult to cook it through without burning it. Use a round cookie cutter to cut out patties of a uniform size."

Fresh sausage should be consumed within a couple of days. If you don\u2019t plan on using it right away, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or a Ziploc gallon bag (vacuum-seal bags are ideal) and freeze. Another option is to cook all the sausage at once, then place it in the refrigerator and reheat as needed. Try to use up precooked sausage within 2-3 days. When properly frozen, sausage will typically stay good for up to three months."
