Keep prying open the track until you\u2019ve bent a 1 in (2.5 cm) section. This area will help you pop the rollers in and out of the track. If you don\u2019t have a pair of pliers, you can also use the back side of a claw hammer.Warning: Only pry the track on one side of your garage at a time so you have more control. If you pry both sides at once, the garage door could fall out of the track."

  "text":" Opening the Garage Door Open your garage door completely. Since it\u2019s easier to work from the roller closest to the bottom of your garage door, you need to open the door before starting work. Lift the garage door open by hand or use the power opener if you have one. Disconnect the power opener from your garage door if you have one. First, pull the release rope attached to the power opener to release the garage door. For added safety, use a ladder to climb up and unplug the power opener so it doesn\u2019t activate while you\u2019re replacing the rollers. If the power opener is hard-wired into your garage, then turn off the breakers or fuses that lead to it. Pry open the track near the front of your garage with pliers. Look for a seam near the top of the vertical piece of track. Grab one side of the track with a pair of pliers and bend it to a 90-degree angle. Keep prying open the track until you\u2019ve bent a 1 in (2.5 cm) section. This area will help you pop the rollers in and out of the track.

If you pry both sides at once, the garage door could fall out of the track. Replacing the Bottom Rollers Pull the garage door down so the roller lines up with the track you pried open. Work slowly so you don\u2019t lose control of the door as you pull it down. When the first roller is lined up with the part of the track you pried open, hold the garage door in place with your non-dominant hand. Have a helper hold the door for you so you don\u2019t have to support its weight while you\u2019re working on the rollers. Keep a work table near the side of the garage you\u2019re working on so you can easily access or set down tools. Pop the first roller out of the track with a flathead screwdriver.
