The result is how many planks can fit onto each step.For example, if the step is 12 inches (30 cm) wide and the planks are 5 inches (13 cm) wide, then the step can fit 2 planks and has 2 inches (5.1 cm) for the nose. The planks may not evenly fit into the step. For instance, if the steps were 14 inches (36 cm), each plank was 5 inches (13 cm), and you needed 2 inches (5.1 cm) for the nose, you\u2019d have 2 inches (5.1 cm) leftover. In this case, you can cut a plank to fill the leftover space. In most cases, the planks will be too long for the steps and have to be cut. However, if you have short planks or long stairs, run the same calculation to determine how many you need to stretch across the step."

Do this on each piece of bamboo you have to cut.If the planks are 36 inches (91 cm) long and your steps are 24 inches (61 cm), measure to the 24 in (61 cm) mark. Make a line at this point."

Power the saw on, then press it into the wood with even pressure until you cut entirely through the piece. Cut along the line on each plank and nose.You can use several different saws for this job, but the easiest would be a circular saw or miter saw. If you use a circular saw, work on a sawhorse for extra safety. A carbide blade cuts through bamboo much easier than a non-carbide blade. Always wear gloves and goggles when operating a power saw. Keep your hands at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from the blade while it\u2019s spinning."

If you get a remainder, that\u2019s how thick a plank has to be to cover the whole step. Make a straight line across the plank lengthwise at this point. Then cut the plank along this line.If the steps were 14 inches (36 cm), each plank was 5 inches (13 cm), and you needed 2 inches (5.1 cm) for the nose, then cut 3 inches (7.6 cm) off one plank. If you have a table saw, splitting wood longways is much easier. If not, you\u2019ll probably have to make multiple cuts to get all the way across."

Press them down and make them even with the step riser.If you didn\u2019t cut any of the pieces lengthwise, then start with any whole piece along the back portion.
