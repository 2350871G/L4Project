  "text":" Making Basic and Easy Vanilla Fudge Prepare your work area. You will want to have a clear, level space with everything laid out, ready to work in. Get out a 9 x 5 inch pan, saucepan, measuring cups, bowls and spoons and clear some fridge space to chill your finished fudge. Having a clear work area makes it easier to make the fudge. Grease the pan. Use vegetable oil, butter, margarine or canola oil and then set them aside. Make sure you always grease your pan when making fudge. If you do not, then your fudge will stick to the pan. Mix the icing sugar and butter together in a saucepan. Stir until creamy and smooth. Make sure there are no lumps before moving onto the next step. This is very important because if you have lumps, your fudge will not be smooth. Turn your stove on to a low heat temperature.

It usually takes five hours for the fudge to set or you can place it in the fridge overnight. Cut the fudge into squares when it has set. Place it on a plate or platter and enjoy! Making Dairy-Free Vanilla Fudge Grease a loaf pan with butter or oil. Make sure you get all the corners in. You can also grease your pan with vegetable spray oil. Mix sugar, dairy free milk, corn syrup and salt in a pan. Cook over a medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. It should be bubbling by now. Make sure that all the ingredients are smooth. Simmer to correct temperature. If you have a candy thermometer then continue cooking until it reaches 235 \u00b0F (113 \u00b0C), or until it forms a soft ball when you drop a small amount into a glass of cold water. This is called the soft ball stage. Take it off the heat. Add the margarine and leave to cool for an hour or two. Don't stir the margarine in. Instead, drop it in gently. Cool the candy.

The fudge will set within five to seven hours. Never put the fudge in the freezer, even if you would like it to be ready sooner. If you place it there, it won't turn out the best. Cut into squares and place in a platter or plate. Enjoy! Making Creamy Vanilla Fudge Get out a pot and place it on a stove.  Mix sugar, corn syrup and light cream and bring it to a boil. Stir the ingredients when it is boiling to ensure that there are no lumps. Slowly add in the butter and salt. Let this boil on high for 5 minutes. Add in the vanilla and mix well. Place in the greased pan and put it in a cooler or fridge in order to let it set. It takes about three to four hours to set. Try serving them on a platter. Enjoy!",
