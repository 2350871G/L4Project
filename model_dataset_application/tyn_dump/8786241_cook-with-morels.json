Avoid any that are soft, wet, spongy, or shriveled because that\u2019s usually a sign that they\u2019re old. Stay away from morels that appear dried out or dehydrated too. They are probably old as well."

          "headline":"Opt for smaller morels.",
          "description":"Large morels are more likely to be spongy and breaking down because they are older. Select smaller morels, which are usually fresh and firm. If you find large morels that are firm and dry, they are usually safe to buy. You may want to cut them down for recipes, though."

          "headline":"Check the mushrooms for insects.",
          "description":"Like other wild mushrooms, morels can sometimes have worms and other insects inside the crevices in their caps. You can still buy morels that have pests in them, but be sure to remove them when you\u2019re cleaning the mushrooms. You can use a dry pastry brush to brush worms, insects, dirt, and debris from the outside of the morels. If you notice silky threads that resemble mold on the morels, they may be fibers excreted by worms so check the mushrooms for pests. While you can pick the worms out of the morels and still cook with them, it\u2019s best to avoid any that appear heavily infested. You\u2019ll usually wind up spending a lot of time cleaning them so they may be more trouble than they\u2019re worth."

Place the morels in a colander, and rinse them under cold water at the sink. After you rinse the mushrooms, shake the colander well and pat the morels dry with paper towel to remove any excess moisture."

Use a sharp knife to carefully cut them down the middle lengthwise before cooking with them. In most dishes, cutting the morels in half is fine. However, if you like, you can quarter them lengthwise if you prefer."

However, you shouldn\u2019t place the mushrooms in a plastic bag because they are airtight, which can cause the moisture to come out of the morels and make them slimy. Opt for paper bags for storage instead. Like plastic bags, plastic storage containers are a poor choice for storing morels because they\u2019re airtight."

    "If you\u2019re not cooking with your morels right away, you should store them in the refrigerator.",
    "However, you shouldn\u2019t place the mushrooms in a plastic bag because they are airtight, which can cause the moisture to come out of the morels and make them slimy.",
    "Opt for paper bags for storage instead.",
    "Like plastic bags, plastic storage containers are a poor choice for storing morels because they\u2019re airtight.",
    "Rehydrating Dried Morels Fill a small bowl with boiling water.",
    "To rehydrated dried morels, you\u2019ll need a small bowl that\u2019s large enough to hold all of the mushrooms.",
    "Fill the bowl with enough boiling water to cover the morels.",
    "If you prefer, you can use warm chicken stock or cream to rehydrate the morels.",
    "In most  cases, 3 ounces (85 g) of dried morels usually equals a pound (454 g) of fresh mushrooms.",
    "Add the mushrooms and let them soak for at least 15 minutes.",
    "After you\u2019ve filled the bowl with hot water, add the morels to it.",
    "Allow them to sit in the hot water for at least 15 minutes, or until they\u2019re soft and pliable.",
    "You can also tell that the morels have soaked long enough if they no longer crack when you bend them.",
    "Drain the morels with a colander or sieve.",
    "When the morels are finished soaking, dump the bowl out into a colander or sieve.",
    "Shake the mushrooms well to ensure that you remove the excess moisture.",
    "You may want to reserve the soaking liquid from the morels.",
    "It has plenty of flavor, so you can mix it into recipes for extra seasoning or use it as a base for soups and sauces.",
    "If the liquid has dirt in it, strain it through a sieve or coffee filter to remove the debris.",
    "Rinse the mushrooms if they still seem gritty.",
    "After you\u2019ve drained the morels, run your fingers over them.",
    "If they feel gritty, place them in a colander or sieve and rinse them under cool water before cooking with them.",
    "Be sure to dry the morels thoroughly before cooking with them.",
    "Making Saut\u00e9ed Morels Heat the oil.",
    "Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil to a large skillet.",
    "Heat the oil on high until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "For the best results, use a cast iron or stainless steel skillet to saute the morels.",
    "You can substitute canola oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer.",
    "Add the mushrooms and cook until they\u2019re browned.",
    "Once the oil is heated, add 8 ounces (227 g) of morel mushrooms that have been cleaned, trimmed, and cut in half to the skillet.",
    "Allow the mushrooms to cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are well browned.",
    "Occasionally stir and toss the mushrooms as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly.",
    "Lower the heat and add the shallots and garlic.",
    "When the mushrooms are browned, reduce the heat on the stove to medium-high.",
    "Mix in a small minced shallot and a minced medium garlic clove, and let the mixture cook until it becomes fragrant, which should take 45 seconds to minute.",
    "If you\u2019re not a fan of garlic, you can leave it out of the dish.",
    "If you enjoy a strong garlic flavor, you can increase the amount to 2 or 3 cloves.",
    "Mix in the butter, soy sauce, lemon juice, and chicken stock.",
    "After the morel mixture has become fragrant, add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and \u00bc cup (59 ml) of low-sodium chicken stock to the skillet.",
    "Allow the mixture to cook until the liquid reduces and a creamy sauce develops, which should take approximately 1 minute.",
    "You can use store-bought or homemade chicken stock.",
    "If you prefer, you can substitute water for the chicken stock.",
    "Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper.",
    "Once the morels are coated in a creamy sauce, mix in 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh parsley.",
    "Season the dish with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, and serve it while it\u2019s still hot.",
    "You can substitute fresh chives or chervil for the parsley.",
    "Making Creamy Morel Sauce Cut the morels in half.",
    "For the creamy morel sauce, you\u2019ll need 2 cups (150 g) of fresh morel mushrooms.",
    "Rinse them under cold water, and use a knife to cut any large mushrooms in half.",
    "It\u2019s best to cut the morels in half lengthwise.",
    "Melt the butter in a pan.",
    "Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter to a medium saucepan.",
    "Heat it on medium until it melts, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "If you prefer, you can substitute olive oil for the butter.",
    "Cook the shallot until it\u2019s translucent.",
    "Once the butter is melted, add a large minced shallot to the pan.",
    "Allow it to cook on medium until it becomes translucent, which should take approximately 1 minute.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a shallot, you can substitute a sweet onion, such as Vidalia.",
    "Mix in the morels and season with salt and pepper.",
    "When the shallot has cooked long enough to become translucent, add the morels.",
    "Next, stir in some salt and freshly ground black pepper to season the mixture.",
    "Add the chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil.",
    "After you\u2019ve seasoned the mixture, mix in 1 cup (237 ml) of chicken stock.",
    "Raise the heat to high, and allow the mixture to come to a full boil, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "You can substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock if you prefer.",
    "Reduce the mixture by half.",
    "When you\u2019ve brought the mixture to a boil, continue boiling it on high heat.",
    "Allow the mixture to reduce by half, which should take approximately 6 minutes.",
    "Stir in the cream and thyme and simmer.",
    "Once the mixture has reduced, add 1 cup (237 ml) of heavy cream and \u00bd teaspoon (\u00bd g) of finely chopped, fresh thyme.",
    "Turn the heat down to medium high, and simmer the sauce until it reduces by a third, which should take approximately 5 minutes.",
    "You can substitute sage, savory, or marjoram for the thyme if you prefer.",
    "Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.",
    "When the sauce has thickened, mix in some more salt and black pepper to taste.",
    "Next, stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and serve immediately.",
    "The creamy morel sauce makes a delicious pasta sauce or a topping for roast chicken, veal, or fish.",
    "You can even ladle some over mashed potatoes or toasted bread.",
    "Whipping Up Morel Mushroom Soup Sprinkle the mushrooms with lemon juice.",
    "For the soup, you\u2019ll need 1 pound (454 g) of fresh morel mushrooms.",
    "Place them in a large bowl, and drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice over them.",
    "Make sure that the morels are rinsed and clean before you begin cooking.",
    "Melt the butter in a pan.",
    "Add 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter to a large saucepan.",
    "Heat it over medium-high heat until the butter melts, which should take approximately 5 minutes.",
    "You can substitute olive oil for the butter if you prefer.",
    "Saute the morels and onion.",
    "Once the butter has melted, add the morels and a large, chopped onion to the pan.",
    "Allow the mixture to cook until the morels and onion become tender, which should take 5 to 6 minutes.",
    "Be sure to stir the mixture occasionally as you saute it to ensure that it cooks evenly.",
    "Add the flour.",
    "When the mushrooms and onion are tender, sprinkle 2 tablespoons (16 g) of all-purpose flour over the mixture.",
    "Stir well to thoroughly blend in the flour.",
    "Mix in the milk, bouillon, thyme, salt and pepper.",
    "Once the flour is mixed in, add 4 cups (946 ml) of milk, 3 teaspoons (8 g) of chicken bouillon granules, \u00bd teaspoon (\u00bd g) of dried thyme, \u00bd teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and \u215b teaspoon (\u00bc g) of black pepper.",
    "Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully combined.",
    "Whole milk will create the creamiest soup, but you can use 2% milk if you prefer.",
    "If you like, you can also mix some dried sage into the soup.",
    "Bring the mixture to a boil and allow to cook for a couple of minutes.",
    "When all of the ingredients are combined, raise the heat to high.",
    "Bring the mixture to a boil, and then allow it to cook for 2 minutes.",
    "Be sure to stir the soup the entire time that it\u2019s boiling.",
    "Reduce the heat and simmer the soup for at least 10 minutes.",
    "After you\u2019ve boiled the soup for a couple of minutes, lower the heat to medium.",
    "Let the soup simmer for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the flavors to deepen.",
    "Divide the soup between bowls and serve.",
    "When the soup is finished simmering, ladle it into individual bowls.",
    "Serve it while it\u2019s still hot.",
