Similarly, if the junction box will be exposed to fumes, such as in a paint shop, choose a junction box formulated for that type of usage. To find the right size junction box in cubic inches, count the number of wires entering the junction box. Multiply the total by 2 when working with 14-gauge wire or by 2.25 when working with 12-gauge wire. Then, select the largest ground wire and add 2 if it is a 14-gauge wire to 2.25 if it is a 12-gauge wire. Choose a junction box with conductor fill volume (which is the number of conductors allowed in a junction box) higher or equal to the number of wires (after multiplying them by 2 and adding in the ground wire) entering the junction box. It\u2019s best to choose a fill volume higher than the number of wires you have to ensure there will be enough room. Stuffing a junction box with wires can lead to fires. All of the wires should have plenty of space to fit cleanly inside the box. When in doubt, always go with a bigger size."

All of the cables should enter through different holes and only touch inside the box.If you use a metal connector to attach armored cables, you must also use a plastic bushing to protect the conductors utilized by the connector. Armored cable tends to be used in commercial wiring rather than residential homes. If you have a metal junction box, look for circles outlined on the box\u2019s sides. Hammer these out to create openings for the cables. If you accidentally create too many openings, seal the ones you won\u2019t use with a knock out seal, as there must not be unused openings in an electrical box. If the box has breakaway plastic tabs (most often found on boxes that will be nailed to the surface), push the tabs out by hand or with a screwdriver. Fasten the cable using a wire staple within 12 inches (30 cm) of the box to secure it. For junction boxes installed on the ceiling, run the cable from the ceiling down into the box."
