Look for a button that says \u201cFlip Horizontally\u201d or \u201cReverse Image\u201d so the design looks backwards on your screen. This will ensure that any text or design elements transfer the right way on your piece of fabric. If you don\u2019t mind the image being reversed in your final design, you don\u2019t have to reverse it beforehand. Don\u2019t flip the image vertically since it will still make text or images look backwards."

Check the packaging for the photo transfer paper to see if it\u2019s made for light- or dark-colored fabrics. Choose the transfer paper that matches the fabric you\u2019re using so the print transfers clearly. You can also find photo transfer paper online if you don\u2019t live near a craft store."

Test printing on a standard sheet of paper first if you don\u2019t want to waste the photo transfer paper. If you aren\u2019t sure which side of the paper gets printed on, put a dot on a standard piece of paper and feed it through your printer with the dot face-up. Look for the dot on the sheet of paper when it finishes printing.Variation: If you don\u2019t have a printer, check your local library or a print shop to see if you can print on photo transfer paper there.

Avoid using an ironing board since it won\u2019t provide hard backing while you transfer the print. Spread a pillowcase flat on the table to protect it before you put down the piece of fabric that you\u2019re transferring the image onto.

Slowly move the iron from left to right over the design for 1\u20133 minutes so the design adheres to the fabric.

Keep the fabric separate from any other laundry just in case the colors run during the cycle. Put the fabric directly in the dryer once the wash cycle finishes and tumble-dry it on low.

    "Keep the fabric in a dry room where it won\u2019t be disturbed.",
