These flowers offer unique, perfumed flavor notes and make an effortless addition to floral cakes because they don't need to be removed prior to serving. Some of the most common types of edible flowers include roses, begonias, chrysanthemums, daisies, dandelions and hibiscus. Each of these edibles can be distinguished by their subtle flavors, which should be used to enhance the flavor of the cake they're to be added to. Flowers like dandelion, chicory and calendula feature bright, zesty notes that can be used to offset the sweetness of a frosted cake, while mild herbal flowers like hibiscus and lavender work well with naked cakes and those garnished with fresh fruit. Though they are technically edible, it is not advisable to use more fragrant types of flowers like roses, carnations and jasmine as food additives, as the chemicals that lend them their characteristic scents can easily overpower the flavors of the confection."
