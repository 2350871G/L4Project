          "description":"Any t-shirt can be turned into a crop top, but it can never be used as a t-shirt again. Therefore, select a t-shirt that\u2019s old (maybe it\u2019s frayed along the edges) or one that you no longer want as a t-shirt (maybe it\u2019s too large to wear as a t-shirt). You could also purchase a t-shirt (new or vintage) to turn into a crop top. You\u2019ll be cutting off the sleeves, bottom, and collar of the t-shirt, therefore if these areas are damaged, it will not impact the crop top. As you\u2019ll be removing the sleeves of the t-shirt, you can use either a short-sleeve or long-sleeve t-shirt."

Once the t-shirt is laying flat again, use your ruler or measuring tape to measure the distance between the bottom of the t-shirt and the line you marked with the pencil. Write that measurement down so you don\u2019t forget it. If you\u2019re unsure how short you want to make the crop top, start with a longer version first. Test out the longer version and, if it\u2019s too long, make additional cuts to shorten the shirt."

Measure the same distance up from the bottom of the t-shirt 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) from each side of the t-shirt and mark with your pencil.

    "Make the cut just on the inside of the seams where the sleeves have been sewn onto the main body of the blouse.",
    "There is no requirement to cut off the sleeves.",
    "If you would prefer a crop top with sleeves, skip this step.",
    "Converting a Tank Top Locate an old or unwanted tank top to make into a crop top.",
    "Find a tank top that you would like to turn into a crop top.",
    "It can be an old tank top, an unwanted tank top, or even a new tank top that you would prefer be turned into a different style.",
    "The style of the tank top doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "However, the longer the tank top, the better, as you\u2019ll be using that length to make ties behind your back.",
    "Tank tops made of stretchy fabrics will work better than those made of stiff fabric.",
    "Cut the front of your tank top in half vertically.",
    "Start the crop top conversion process by making a straight cut down the middle of the front of the tank top using your sharp scissors.",
    "You want the cut to be made vertically, from the top middle of the front of the tank top to the bottom middle of the front of the tank top.",
    "If your tank top has a couple of buttons on the front, undo the buttons and make the cut starting at the bottom of the button seam.",
    "Determine how long the back of the crop top should be.",
    "The back of the crop top should be long enough to cover the back of your bra, but it doesn\u2019t have to be much longer than that.",
    "Try on the tank top to measure that distance or estimate the distance without trying it on.",
    "Use a ruler and a pencil to mark a cut line along the entire back of the tank top, from the left side to the right side.",
    "If you need to cut more fabric off the back later, you can.",
    "Cut off the bottom portion of the back of your tank top.",
    "Lay your tank top on a flat surface with the front side down.",
    "Make one vertical cut on the left side of the back of the tank top, upwards from the bottom to the cut line, on the left of the left-side seam.",
    "Repeat the same process on the right side, to the right of the right-side seam.",
    "Then make a cut from left to right, along the cut line marked in pencil.",
    "When the back is cut off, you want to make sure both side seams have been cut off as well.",
    "Try on your new wrap-around crop top.",
    "Try on your new crop top.",
    "Take the right front side of the top, pull is across you right breast, and bring the bottom portion of the fabric around to your back.",
    "Take the left front side of the top, pull it over your left breast and the right-side fabric, and bring the bottom portion around to your back.",
    "Tie the two pieces of fabric together at your back.",
    "If the fabric pieces are long enough, you can tie them into a bow.",
    "Otherwise, just make a knot with the fabric."
