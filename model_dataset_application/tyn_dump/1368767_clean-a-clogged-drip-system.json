According to the team at Grow it Organically: \"When you run water through the irrigation system, any particles or dirt in the line are going to be flushed out, so they won't end up in the emitter. When you're getting ready to use the system in the spring, flush the lines and check the filters, and then you usually won't have problems in the summer.\""
