  "text":" Preparing the Seeds Preheat the oven to 170\u00baC/340\u00baF. Lay parchment paper across the baking sheet or dish. Rinse the sesame seeds in a fine colander. Shake and drip dry. Note that if you feel the seeds are clean enough, you may skip this step (although, see Tips below for a suggestion about reducing phytic acid). Arrange the seeds across the baking sheet. Place in the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning. They're ready when they've uniformly turned a light brown. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.  Processing the Seeds Set the blades in the food processor. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Tip the lightly browned sesame seeds into the food processor. Pour a quarter of the cup of oil into the processor bowl, on top of the seeds. Pulse at full speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Stop pulsing occasionally to push down any stuck grains back into the mixture for processing. (Use a spatula.) Pour in the remaining oil (if needed).
