Avoid using material that doesn\u2019t have any stretch, as this makes the socks difficult to put on. Your material needs to be approximately 60 centimetres (24 in) x 60 centimetres (24 in). Any fabric, such as cotton, polyester, or linen, will work as long as has a small percentage of spandex in it. Check the label of the fabric to determine what it is made of."

Cut about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) away from the sock to make the fabric template slightly larger than your sock. This ensures that the socks fit correctly. Repeat this process to create 2 cut-outs in total."

Try to cut the fabric as close as you can to the cut-out sock to ensure that it is the same size. Then, repeat this step with the other cut-out sock. If you don\u2019t have fabric scissors, use a sharp pair of kitchen scissors instead. This creates 4 cut-outs in total.

Make sure that you don\u2019t sew over the foot hole! Always back stitch before you start sewing to stop the threads from coming loose.

Set your machine to the straight stitch, and then sew around the edge and foot seams of your sock to join them together.

For example, if your foot is 12 inches (30 cm) in circumference, the equation would be: 12 x 4 = 48. This helps to ensure that your socks will be the correct size for you. In order for the equation to work, you need to use inches in the calculation. To convert a measurement from inches to centimetres, divide it by 2.5. These instructions create a heel-less sock. These socks are comfy to wear and much easier to knit than regular socks."

If you want the socks to come to your knees, you will need to make them extra long. On average, female shin-length socks are about 20 inches (51 cm) long and male socks are 27 inches (69 cm) long. Ribbed and knit stitch patterns are popular for socks. Hold the knitted material up to your foot and leg to help you estimate the length of the socks. Use the same stitch for the entire sock to make them look cohesive."

Instead of releasing 1 stitch from your needle, drop 2 stitches instead to decrease the total number of stitches. Drop 2 stitches each row for 5 rows to create a gentle diagonal line at the end of the sock. Hold the knitting over your foot to check that it follows the curve of your toes. If necessary, continue to drop 2 stitches each row until the toe section of the sock is the correct length."

Pull the wool through the top stitch on the right seam of the sock and then pull it through the top stitch on the left seam of the sock to pull them together into a tube shape. Continue to join the seam by threading the wool through each stitch down the entire seam of the socks. Use wool that is the same colour as your socks to help it blend in. A needle with a wide eye works best for this task, as it is easier to thread."
