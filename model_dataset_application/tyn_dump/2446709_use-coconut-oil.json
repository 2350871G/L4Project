          "description":"Since it has a high smoke point and mild flavor, coconut oil is a great choice for a variety of cooking methods. If you\u2019re saut\u00e9ing or pan frying, use an equal amount of coconut oil as whatever other fat the recipe calls for (butter, olive oil, vegetable oil, etc.). To roast vegetables with coconut oil, melt 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 ml) of the oil\u2014or whatever amount your recipe calls for\u2014over low heat in a small saucepan, then drizzle it over your veggies on the roasting pan. Season and roast the vegetables according to your chosen recipe."

          "description":"Simply make your hot beverage of choice as usual, then stir in 1 tsp (5 ml) of coconut oil before adding any cream or sweetener. The hot liquid will quickly melt the congealed oil. The coconut oil will create a bit of an oily texture (especially on the surface) and impart a mild flavor to the beverage. If you don\u2019t care for the results, try replacing half of the coconut oil with unsalted butter (or just cut back on the coconut oil and don\u2019t substitute anything else). Is it worth making your morning coffee a bit oily by adding coconut oil? It might be. It's possible, but not certain, that coconut oil may help reduce cholesterol, burn fat, kill harmful bacteria, and improve brain function, among other benefits."

Congealed coconut oil may leave small chunks in your smoothie\u2014if this bothers you, melt the coconut oil on the stovetop using low heat, then drizzle it into the smoothie ingredients before blending.
