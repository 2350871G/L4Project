The best sleeves are composed of either a plastic liner within a paper inner, or as a round-bottomed plastic-only sleeve. Storing your record in one of these sleeves is essential to protect it from scratches and debris. These can be purchased both online and in local music stores. Most records come with paper sleeves. Avoid using these because as you slide your records in and out over time, the paper acts as fine grain piece of sandpaper that will add scratches to your vinyl."

Opt for the softer, roomier sleeves to avoid peeling off the record\u2019s artwork. These can be purchased both online and in local music stores. Avoid the heavy gauge plastic sleeves. Over time, these can compress and stick to the record sleeve. When removed, they may damage the artwork. You can also use a vinyl bag that fits like a normal sleeve but has a large flap and adhesive strip on the outside to fully enclose the record."

Opt for a shelving system that has built-in square shelves or inserts that will hold baskets or boxes. You can purchase inexpensive shelving systems from local furniture stores. Be sure to strengthen the system by adding L-shaped metal brackets to avoid having your shelving system lean to one side. Use dividers to help catalog your records for easier access. You can find record dividers online which allow you to write in categories, genres, or the alphabet. Never lay your records flat as this will cause them to warp. Store them vertically instead."

In addition, avoid storing in areas where the record will be exposed to a lot of dust or airborne particles. Avoid areas like basements that tend to have leaks and environmental extremes. Proper storage temperature is between 46-50 degrees\u00b0 F, with 30-40% relative humidity."
