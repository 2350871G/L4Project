Measure and mark the cut lines first, then cut the lumber with a miter saw. Cut five 2x10\" boards to 69 inches (180 cm) in length. If the miter saw is too small to make one cut, cut halfway through, then rotate the board and cut again. Refer to the end of this article for a list of all lumber and supplies required.

A little warp is fine, but try a different order for the boards if there's a major gap. Mark the pocket hole locations.

Measure the width of your tabletop to find out how long the breadboard ends should be. Cut two more lengths of 2x10 to this length. This should be about 46\u00bc\". Attach the breadboard ends. Line these up level and flush with the two ends of the table. Drill 2.5\" Kreg screws through the remaining pocket holes to attach these two boards. Your tabletop is now complete. Assembling the Table Base Cut 4x4 lumber to form the table ends. Cut these with a miter saw, adjusting the saw to cut at an angle where described below. You'll need the following cuts of lumber to form the two ends of the table:\nTwo 4x4s to 43\" length (end tops)\nFour 4x4s to 25\u215c\" length, with ends cut parallel at a 10\u00ba angle (table legs)\nTwo 4x4 at 36\u00bc\" length, with ends cut not parallel at 10\u00ba angle (end braces) Sand off rough edges. As before, run an orbital sander over the cut wood to smooth out the surface. Lay out the end. On a flat surface, lay out a table end as follows:\nPut down one of the 43\" \"end top.\" Position two 25\u215c\" legs against the first board, leaning inward in the style of a picnic table. Place a 36\u00bc\" board between the two legs as a horizontal base. Adjust the position of this piece and the legs until they are flush against each other, and centered under the top board. Put together the table ends. Drill in three 6\" torque screws at each point where two boards touch (twelve screws in all). Put together the second table end the same way you did the first.

Measure the distance between them (it should be about 73\"), then cut the following lumber to that dimension:\nTwo 4x4s for braces\nTwo 2x4s for the apron\nAs before, sand the cut surfaces smooth before you continue. Attach one brace to the end pieces. One of the 4x4 braces connects the top of the table ends. Keep the table ends upside down so you can rest this brace on the floor. Drill each end into the brace with two or three 6\" torque screws. Attach the 2x4 apron with the Kreg Jig. Drill two pocket holes in each end of each 2x4, using the same 1.5\" setting as before. Lay these parallel with the 4x4 brace you just drilled, running between the two ends right where the table legs connect to the rest of the table. Drill each pocket hole with 2.5\" Kreg screws, as before. For greater strength, stand the 2x4s vertically rather than laying them flat. Attach the final 4x4 brace.

Drill torque screws through the bottom of the boards and into the tabletop. Place them as follows:\nTwo 4.5\" torque screws near each end of the end top, outside of the legs\nA 4.5\" screw about every 5-6\" on the end top, between the legs\nMore 4.5\" screws every 5-6\" along the central lengthwise 4x4 brace.

Measure the length of a line running at a 45\u00ba angle from the end of the central 4x4 inward to the lower 4x4 brace. (This should be about 26\u215b\".) Cut two 4x4s to this length, cutting the ends to a 45\u00ba angle so they are not parallel with each other. Sand them, then drill them in with three 6\" torque screws on each end. Finishing the Table Level the top with a hand planer. The tabletop surface may be rough, especially if you used construction-grade lumber. Wear down the worst offending areas with a hand planer. Sand the table. Start with obvious dents using a 40-60 grit sanding pad. Next, sand the entire table using progressively higher grit, ending with 120 or 220 grit.

    "Cut lumber for the long braces.",
    "Position the end pieces upside down on either end of the tabletop.",
    "Measure the distance between them (it should be about 73\"), then cut the following lumber to that dimension:\nTwo 4x4s for braces\nTwo 2x4s for the apron\nAs before, sand the cut surfaces smooth before you continue.",
    "Attach one brace to the end pieces.",
    "One of the 4x4 braces connects the top of the table ends.",
    "Keep the table ends upside down so you can rest this brace on the floor.",
    "Drill each end into the brace with two or three 6\" torque screws.",
    "Attach the 2x4 apron with the Kreg Jig.",
    "Drill two pocket holes in each end of each 2x4, using the same 1.5\" setting as before.",
    "Lay these parallel with the 4x4 brace you just drilled, running between the two ends right where the table legs connect to the rest of the table.",
    "Drill each pocket hole with 2.5\" Kreg screws, as before.",
    "For greater strength, stand the 2x4s vertically rather than laying them flat.",
    "Attach the final 4x4 brace.",
    "You'll have to attach this one in midair, running parallel with the other 4x4, between the two end braces.",
    "Either have a friend hold it in place, or raise it with two jack clamps.",
    "Use two or three 6\" torque screws for each end.",
    "Attach the base to the tabletop.",
    "Lay the tabletop flat on the floor and place the base on top of it.",
    "Drill torque screws through the bottom of the boards and into the tabletop.",
    "Place them as follows:\nTwo 4.5\" torque screws near each end of the end top, outside of the legs\nA 4.5\" screw about every 5-6\" on the end top, between the legs\nMore 4.5\" screws every 5-6\" along the central lengthwise 4x4 brace.",
    "Switch to 2.5\" torque screws and drill one every 5-6\" through the 2x4 apron boards.",
    "Cut and attach diagonal braces.",
    "Flip the table on its side.",
    "Measure the length of a line running at a 45\u00ba angle from the end of the central 4x4 inward to the lower 4x4 brace.",
    "(This should be about 26\u215b\".)",
    "Cut two 4x4s to this length, cutting the ends to a 45\u00ba angle so they are not parallel with each other.",
    "Sand them, then drill them in with three 6\" torque screws on each end.",
    "Finishing the Table Level the top with a hand planer.",
    "The tabletop surface may be rough, especially if you used construction-grade lumber.",
    "Wear down the worst offending areas with a hand planer.",
    "Sand the table.",
    "Start with obvious dents using a 40-60 grit sanding pad.",
    "Next, sand the entire table using progressively higher grit, ending with 120 or 220 grit.",
    "Be sure to sand the sides of the tabletop as well, especially where the breadboard ends attach to the main surface.",
    "Optionally, smooth out the corners and top edge of the table with the sander.",
    "Distress the table (optional).",
    "If you prefer a well-worn look, you can mark the table with nail dents, saw marks, or any other surface damage you'd like to inflict.",
    "Apply finish.",
    "You may refer to our detailed guide, or follow the instructions on the wood finish of your choice.",
    "Wipe on the finish with a clean rag.",
    "Wait a few hours for the finish to dry, or as directed on the finish instructions.",
    "You can make your own rustic finish by letting steel wool dissolve in white vinegar.",
    "This takes about two or three days in an open Mason jar.",
    "Filter the liquid through a paper towel, then wait a few additional hours until it turns an amber color.",
    "Seal the table.",
    "A polyurethane sealer will protect from spills and enhance the wood's color.",
    "Brush on two or three coats of polyurethane, letting the wood dry for 12+ hours between each coat.",
    "For best results, sand the table before each coat and wipe it off with damp rag.",
    "Follow the safety instructions on the product.",
    "Work in a well-ventilated area or wear a respiratory mask.",
    "Use a well-made brush in good condition to avoid losing bristles in the polyurethane."
