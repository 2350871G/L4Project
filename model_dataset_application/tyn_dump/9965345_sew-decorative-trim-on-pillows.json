Fringe comes in different types as well, including flat fringe, tasseled fringe, and pom pom fringe. Choose fringe in a color that will compliment your pillow\u2019s fabric.

          "headline":"Opt for ribbon or bias tape for a colorful accent.",
          "description":"If you are just looking for something to add a pop of color, go with a bias tape or ribbon trim. You can choose a solid color of ribbon or bias tape, or something with a print. Choose a ribbon or bias tape that is about 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) wide depending on how wide you want the trim to be. Make sure the ribbon or bias tape is a color that will compliment your pillow, such as a light pink ribbon for a white pillow or black ribbon for a leopard print pillow. Look for ribbons in different textures, such as satin, mesh, and lace. Adding a textured ribbon around the edges of a pillow can make a basic, solid color or print pillow into something special and romantic."

However, rick rack will not wrap around the edges of your pillow because of the waves. Instead, you can sew the rick rack onto the edges of the pillow on 1 or both sides. Choose a rick rack color that will make your pillow fabric pop. Such as a hot pink rick rack for a lime green pillow, or white rick rack with a red print fabric."

Then, pin through the bias tape near the cord to hold it in place. After that, you can pin and sew the piping onto the edges of your pillow like you would with any other trim. Choose a piping color that will help to make your pillow's fabric pop, such as purple piping for a green pillow, or gold piping for a black pillow."

If your trim requires stitches on both sides, wrap the trim around to the other side of the fabric and sew along the edges of the trim on that side just as you sewed the first side.

For example, if your pillow has a pink floral print with a teal background, then opt for a teal fringe to make the background color pop. Opt for ribbon or bias tape for a colorful accent. If you are just looking for something to add a pop of color, go with a bias tape or ribbon trim. You can choose a solid color of ribbon or bias tape, or something with a print.
