Mesquite and alder wood chips are recommended for use with this recipe. Note that this step does not need to be done if you are using pre-soaked wood chips."

For a charcoal smoker, fill the charcoal tray with an even layer of coals. For a gas smoker, attach an appropriately sized propane tank. For an electrical smoker, plug the power supply into an outlet."

          "description":"Light the coals or turn on the heat source. After the smoker achieves a high and steady heat, reduce the heat to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius). Open the air vents when you start preheating the smoker. Allow the smoker to heat up for 20 to 30 minutes, at which point it will be about 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Turn the air vents so that they are almost completely closed. This should cause the temperature to drop. Watch the thermometer and wait until it drops between 250 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit (130 and 135 degrees Celsius)."

Piercing the skin of the potato allows steam to escape from the spud during the cooking process. While rare, potatoes can theoretically explode while being cooked if the skin is left intact."

When using a gas smoker, it is recommended that you place the wood chips in a foil packet instead of laying them directly on the bottom of the appliance. Use a fork to poke holes in the top of the packet six to eight times, then place the packet near the heat source. Wait until the wood chips begin to smoke before proceeding."

    "Reduce the heat of the remaining burners to medium or medium-low.",
    "Wait approximately 10 minutes for the temperature inside the grill to drop.",
    "If the grill has a thermometer inside or on the lid, wait for the internal temperature to read 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius) before proceeding.",
    "Place wood chips in a smoker box, if applicable.",
    "If your grill has a smoker attachment, fill it with your soaked wood chips now.",
    "Continue preheating the grill until you see smoke coming from the attachment.",
    "Prepare the potatoes.",
    "Pierce each potato several times with a metal fork, the season with melted butter, salt, and pepper.",
    "Pierce each potato 8 to 12 times, spacing the holes evenly around the surface.",
    "Doing this lets steam and pressure escape from the potato during the cooking process.",
    "Brush enough melted butter over each potato to completely coat the surface.",
    "Use as much salt and pepper as desired to satisfy your own tastes.",
    "Place the potatoes on the grill.",
    "Arrange the prepared potatoes over the drip tray placed in your prepared grill, keeping them in a single layer.",
    "Try to keep 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them, if not more.",
    "Good air circulation will result in better cooking.",
    "The potatoes must be over the drip tray regardless of whether that tray is in the center of the grill or along one side.",
    "Cover and smoke until tender.",
    "Cover the grill and smoke the potatoes for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.",
    "You do not need to turn the potatoes as they cook.",
    "When ready, the potatoes should be roughly the same consistency as a baked potato.",
    "You should be able to squeeze the center with your fingers, but the potato should not completely fall apart when you do so.",
    "You should also be able to easily pierce the potato with a metal skewer.",
    "Serve warm.",
    "Remove the smoked potatoes from your grill.",
    "Let them cool slightly for 2 to 5 minutes, then serve and enjoy.",
    "Serve smoked potatoes like you would serve baked potatoes.",
    "Slice each potato open and add butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, green onions, or any other toppings you may desire."
