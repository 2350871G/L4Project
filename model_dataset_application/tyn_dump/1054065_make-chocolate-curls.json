  "text":" Using a Knife Melt the chocolate. Pour approximately one cup of water into a double boiler or saucepan. Melt one cup of chocolate or a large chocolate bar slowly on low heat over the boiler, or in a heat-safe bowl that can be placed on top of a saucepan. Stir constantly once the chocolate begins to melt. Do not overheat the chocolate or allow water droplets to get into your mixture or your batch will be ruined.
