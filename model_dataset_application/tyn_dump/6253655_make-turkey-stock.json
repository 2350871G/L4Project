If you'd like to add herbs, put a few sprigs of fresh parsley or thyme into the pot.Tip: Try to remove most of the skin from the carcass before you put it in the pot. This will make a clearer stock that doesn't contain as much fat."

About 1/2 of the liquid in the pot should evaporate once the stock has finished cooking. You may need to adjust the burner if the stock begins to boil or it stops simmering."
