          "description":"For lines thinner than 0.5 in (1.3 cm), a pointed round brush is your best bet. A flat brush will lead to uneven lines as you change directions with it, while a regular round brush won\u2019t give you a lot of freedom when it comes to the width of your line. This brush is perfect for painting facial features, tree branches, cloud details, and other objects that require definition and control. The size of the brush will determine the width of the line, so choose your specific pointed round brush based on how thick you want the mark to be. For thin lines, you\u2019ll likely need a #8 brush, or smaller."

Liner brushes have an extremely low number of bristles that are bundled tightly together, which makes them perfect for extremely thin marks. Grab a set of liner brushes to make the smallest lines possible.Tip: When brushes get this small, the sizing conventions can seem a little odd. Brushes that are size 0 are actually the biggest liner brushes, followed by 00, 000, and 0000. After that, the bigger the number over zero is, the smaller the brush. For example, 4/0 is bigger than 10/0. The smallest brush is 20/0. These brushes are great for adding tiny details, highlighting small objects, and painting background figures with a high degree of accuracy. They\u2019re also phenomenal for adding small objects like hair, grass, and rain. Liner brushes are also known as detail brushes. These brushes are identical. Brushes do not get smaller than the liner brush."

          "description":"If you\u2019re trying to paint an even line and keep it thin, use a rigger brush. A rigger brush is much longer than a standard brush, which makes it easier to control the bristles with minimal wrist movement. The longer bristles also help to maintain uniform contact with the surface you\u2019re painting when you drag them at an angle. This leads to flatter, even colors in your lines. This brush is the best choice for medium-sized lines that need to be straight. This is a great choice for rays of light, comets, light poles, straight tree trunks, and shooting stars. This brush is not the best choice for lines thinner than 0.25 inches (0.64 cm), since the bristles make more contact with the surface when you use the brush."

          "description":"Since acrylic paint has water in it, natural bristles will absorb the water and result in weaker, more inconsistent lines. Inversely, synthetic bristles don\u2019t mind water at all and will retain their shape even when they\u2019re wet. Choose brushes with synthetic bristles when working with acrylic paint. When it comes to the size of the brush, use whatever feels good in your hand. There are no hard rules surrounding what size your brush should be. At the art store, pick brushes up and hold them in your hand to see how they feel."

The amount of paint that you load into your brush directly correlates with how paint will be applied when you use the brush.

To fill these lines in, use multiple applications of paint to darken the line. Use the same method that you used to apply the paint the first time to ensure that the texture is even. Paint directly over your line as needed until the color is even and uniform. Thin lines don\u2019t always come out cleanly because the individual bristles don\u2019t always retain the same amount of paint as you\u2019re applying it. Since a smaller number of bristles are applying your paint, the odds are higher the paint won\u2019t come out evenly."

    "If you use a fine line bottle while your painting surface is laying flat, gravity will naturally pull a larger amount of paint out of the bottle as you use it.",
    "This can lead to some messy lines.",
    "Choose a toothpick for tiny lines and to add movement to wet paint.",
    "Dip the tip of your toothpick in the paint and drag the tip into the surface that you\u2019re painting to apply an extremely thin line.",
    "You can use the sharp point of the toothpick for barely-visible lines, or the flat edge on the side of the point for slightly larger lines.",
    "Alternatively, you can use the tip of a toothpick to add small lines to wet paint.",
    "After painting a surface, drag the tip of the toothpick in the wet paint.",
    "Drag lightly to add movement to the paint or drag firmly to remove the paint and create a light line where the paint used to be."
