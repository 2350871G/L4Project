    "For best results, wait a full day before resuming work on the floor.",
    "Mix one batch of each epoxy product immediately prior to application.",
    "Both epoxy primer and standard epoxy will come in 2 parts.",
    "These needs to be mixed together, one batch at a time, right before they are applied.",

    "Pour the entire contents into a second bucket and mix again.",
    "Epoxy kits are pre-measured.",
    "Mix all of part A together with all of part B to create the amount of epoxy listed.",
    "Most epoxy products (including most primers) have a \u201cbucket life\u201d of about 40 minutes.",
    "This means that the product must be applied within this time window before it hardens.",
    "Apply your first coat of epoxy.",
    "Once again use a \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) nap roller to apply your epoxy.",
    "Begin in the corner of the room, and make your way toward the exit.",

    "Remember to mix the epoxy immediately prior to application.",
    "Move as quickly as you can without being sloppy.",
    "Epoxy has a short working time.",
    "Wait 24 hours for your first coat to dry.",
    "Always make sure there is adequate ventilation during the drying process.",

    "Curing time will vary slightly across epoxy products.",
    "Read and follow the manufacturer's directions for the product you select.",
    "Check for problems before applying a second coat.",
    "Examine your floor for any problems that have appeared.",
    "This can include cracks, holes, or uneven surfaces that weren\u2019t visible before.",
    "Seal any cracks with an epoxy crack filler and/or sand down areas that are uneven.",
    "If you used sand paper, you may need to do another run with your vacuum to remove any debris.",
    "Wait 12-16 hours for the crack filler to dry, if you used it.",
    "If you had to patch any new cracks in your first coat of epoxy, wait at least half a day for the crack filler to dry before applying a second coat.",
