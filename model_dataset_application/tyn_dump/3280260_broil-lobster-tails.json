Make a final horizontal cut at the base of the tail, connecting the two lengthwise cuts. As you cut, make sure to keep the blade close to the top underside of the shell.

You can leave the digestive tract in place, if desired, and it should not affect the taste of the lobster tail. Removing it is mostly done for aesthetic purposes."
