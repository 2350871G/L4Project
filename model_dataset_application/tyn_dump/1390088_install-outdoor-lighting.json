Use string or spray paint to plot a route that takes an electric cable from the transformer to each of the light fixtures you\u2019ll install. This will allow you to plan ahead of time where you\u2019ll dig and bury the cable. Try to steer clear of placing the route near any trees, since they\u2019ll likely have shallow roots that will interfere with the installation process. Plan on setting up your transformer box next to an outdoor electrical outlet."

Using a ditch-witch or trenching shovel is ideal since these tools will give you a more narrow trench. You don\u2019t want to have to move a bunch of loose dirt around during this installation process. Don\u2019t worry about the width of the trench; just make it as wide as the width of your shovel."

Use string or spray paint to plot a route that takes an electric cable from the transformer to each of the light fixtures you\u2019ll install.

Try to steer clear of placing the route near any trees, since they\u2019ll likely have shallow roots that will interfere with the installation process.

Make sure you can push the cable all the way down to the bottom of the trench, so that it won\u2019t jut out of the trench when you go to bury it. Connecting the Wiring to the House Run the cable up to the outdoor outlet and strip the end of it.

You can also use a utility knife to strip the wire, although it will be much easier to use the wire strippers. If the cable has cable nuts, remove them before stripping it.
