          "description":"A hole saw is a metal circular saw that attaches to a drill. It is a quick and easy tool to use for cutting circles that are between .5\u20136 inches (1.3\u201315.2 cm) wide. Hole saws and their attachments are available at all hardware and home improvement stores. In addition to buying the hole saw, you will need to buy an arbor and a pilot bit for the saw. The arbor is the connecting piece that attaches the saw to the drill and the pilot bit guides the hole saw and it begins cutting. Hole saws create a small pilot hole at the center of the circle that they cut out. If you need the circle to be solid instead, you may not want to use a hole saw. If you need to use the circle of wood that is cut out, pay attention to the interior diameter of the hole saw you purchase. In general, the size of the hole saw refers to the exterior of the saw but the interior size will be listed in small print."

          "description":"At the center of the arbor should be a hole that is big enough to insert the pilot bit into it. Put the end of the pilot bit in the hole and then tighten the set screw on the arbor that holds it in place. Then you can screw the hole saw onto the arbor. Most set screws can be turned with an allen wrench (also known as a hex key), although the size you will need varies. Most hole saws that are over about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter have an additional prong that is inserted into the base of the saw from the arbor. Once the hole saw is attached to the arbor, the end of the arbor can be inserted into the drill."

          "headline":"Secure the wood in place and clear the space beneath it.",
          "description":"When you use a hole saw to cut a circle in wood there is a lot of torque created by the saw and you will cut all the way through the wood. Because of this you need to use clamps or have someone hold the wood while you drill it. You also need to make sure that there is open space below the wood so that the hole saw does not accidentally cut into anything it shouldn\u2019t. For example, you can put the wood in a vise or have it hanging over the end of a table that you clamp the wood to."

This will be where you place the center of the pilot bit as you prepare to drill. If it doesn\u2019t matter exactly where the circle is cut, you can place that end of the bit anywhere you like on the wood."

          "description":"When the hole saw drops down on the wood and makes contact, it can get stuck on the wood and wrench the drill and your hand around instead of going through the wood. If this happens, stop the drill and lift up on the saw a bit. Start the drill again and lightly make contact with the wood so that the saw can work through the wood gradually. If the hole saw binds up and wrenches the drill, your wrist can be hurt while you are trying to control it. Be prepared to turn off the drill quickly so that this doesn't happen."

          "description":"If you cut straight through the wood without stopping, it can cause the backside to become jagged and rough when the hole saw pops through. To avoid this, cut part way through the hole and then flip the wood over. Stick the pilot bit in the existing pilot hole and start sawing. Your second cut will meet up with the first in the middle of the hole. This will give you a beautiful smooth cut on both sides of the board."

However, if the circle of wood is fully inside of the hole saw, you will need to work a bit harder to get it out.
