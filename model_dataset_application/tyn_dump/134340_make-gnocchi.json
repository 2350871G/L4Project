    "VT\t\t\t\t\tVanna Tran\t\t\tExperienced Cook\t\t\t\tVanna Tran, experienced cook, advises: \"When boiling the pasta, you want to make sure that your water is as salty as the sea.",
    "Most of the salt will end up going down your drain but a small bit of it will find its way into your pasta, giving you a much more flavorful final product.\"",
    "Boil the gnocchi for 2 to 4 minutes.",
    "Continue to boil the gnocchi until they're cooked throughout and they float to the top of the water.",
    "Stir them occasionally as they boil to prevent them from clumping together.",
    "Avoid adding oil to the water while the gnocchi is boiling.",
    "It's better to stir the pasta to prevent it from sticking together.",
    "Use a slotted spoon to remove the gnocchi.",
    "Turn off the burner and carefully scoop the gnocchi out of the water using a slotted spoon.",
    "Transfer the gnocchi to a saucepan.",
    "It's important to drain off all of the water or the gnocchi will become mushy.",
    "Cook the gnocchi with your choice of sauce for 2 minutes.",
    "Add your favorite sauce to the saucepan with the gnocchi.",
    "Turn the burner to medium and cook the pasta in the sauce for about 2 minutes.",
    "The gnocchi is now ready to be served.",
    "Cooking the gnocchi with the sauce will make the gnocchi tender and will help the sauce stick to the pasta.",
    "Refrigerate leftover cooked gnocchi in an airtight container for up to 3 to 5 days.",
