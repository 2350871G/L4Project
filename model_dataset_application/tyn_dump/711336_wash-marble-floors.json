Michelle Driscoll, MPH\t\t\tFounder, Mulberry Maids\t\t\t\tMichelle Driscoll, a cleaning expert, recommends: \"When cleaning marble, be sure to stay away from harsh chemicals, like bleach, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and vinegar.

Harsh chemical solutions like bleach, hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and vinegar can be damaging to your floors. Avoid using these on marble.
