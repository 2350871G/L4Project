Use boiling water instead of running hot water from the tap, since it may take a while for the hot water to kick in. Mixing Baking Soda, Salt, and Vinegar Pour dry ingredients down the drain. Use a narrow cup or glass for mixing. Pour in a 1/2 cup of baking soda. Add a 1/4 cup of salt. Stir until they are evenly mixed. Remove the stopper from the drain if there is one. Then pour the contents down the drain. Add warm vinegar. Heat 1 cup of vinegar in the microwave or on the stovetop. Once it reaches simmering, pour it directly down the drain.
