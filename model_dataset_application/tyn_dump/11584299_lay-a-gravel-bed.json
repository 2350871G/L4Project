          "description":"You can order crushed stone from a landscaping company if you want to get it delivered to your home, or buy some yourself at a home supply or construction store. Calculating how much stone you need is kind of tricky. For a general estimate, multiply the length times the width of your pit to get the square footage (or square meters). Then, double this number and compare it to the square footage listed on a bag of crushed stone. You can use sand instead of crushed stone if you live in a tropical environment where it rains a lot and gets extremely hot. Crushed stone comes in a variety of different forms. Limestone, granite, and marble chips will all work for this process. It doesn\u2019t really matter since you\u2019re only using it as a base. For example, if your pit is 6 by 8 feet (1.8 by 2.4 m), multiply 6 ft (1.8 m) by 8 ft (2.4 m) to get 48 sq ft (4.5 m). Double this number to get 96 sq ft (8.9 m).

    "You can visually estimate what 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) looks like, or you can use a measuring tape to measure how deep you\u2019ve gone.",
    "Smooth the soil out with a steel rake to make your foundation even.",
    "Get a steel rake with a flat edge on the back of the tines.",
    "Use the tines to rip up any uneven areas of soil.",
    "Use the flat backside of the rake to shift the loose soil around to make the foundation even and level.",
    "You can use a flat edge of your spade to shift the soil around if you prefer.",
    "It doesn\u2019t really matter how you do this.",
    "Compact the soil with a hand tamper to stabilize the base.",
    "Get a hand tamper from your local home supply store.",
    "Use the hand tamper to compact the soil by slamming the flat plate into every portion of the soil that you\u2019ve excavated.",
    "Compacting the soil will ensure that your pit stays stable and flat over time.",
    "A hand tamper is a large pole with a flat, metal plate at the bottom.",
    "It is used to compress soil and stone so that it doesn\u2019t shift around.",
    "You cannot use an electric plate compactor for this particular step unless you\u2019re compacting hard clay.",
    "Laying Your Stone Base Get enough crushed stone to fill 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of your pit.",
    "You can order crushed stone from a landscaping company if you want to get it delivered to your home, or buy some yourself at a home supply or construction store.",
    "Calculating how much stone you need is kind of tricky.",
    "For a general estimate, multiply the length times the width of your pit to get the square footage (or square meters).",
    "Then, double this number and compare it to the square footage listed on a bag of crushed stone.",
    "You can use sand instead of crushed stone if you live in a tropical environment where it rains a lot and gets extremely hot.",
    "Crushed stone comes in a variety of different forms.",
    "Limestone, granite, and marble chips will all work for this process.",
    "It doesn\u2019t really matter since you\u2019re only using it as a base.",
    "For example, if your pit is 6 by 8 feet (1.8 by 2.4 m), multiply 6 ft (1.8 m) by 8 ft (2.4 m) to get 48 sq ft (4.5 m).",
    "Double this number to get 96 sq ft (8.9 m).",
    "You can use an online calculator to determine how much stone you need.",
    "You can find one of these calculators at http://fredburrows.com/calculator/calc.html.",
    "Line the pit with 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of crushed stone.",
    "Pour your crushed stone directly out of the bag or use a shovel to add it to your pit.",
    "Pour enough crushed stone to fill the bottom 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of your pit.",
    "After you add 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) worth of stone across an area, use a ruler to measure how deep the base is to ensure that you aren\u2019t overpouring.",
    "You can always remove excess stone with a shovel or pour more crushed stone into the pit, so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get it perfectly right the first time.",
    "Use your steel rake to spread the stone around and level it out.",
    "Once you\u2019ve poured your stone out, use the tines of your steel rake to work the stone around your pit.",
    "Use the flat edge of the rake to even the stone out and create a flat surface.",
    "If you\u2019d like, use a spirit level to ensure that you\u2019ve spread your stone out evenly across the surface.",
    "Do your best to keep the stone level around the edges of the pit.",
    "Don\u2019t worry if there are a few elevated stones around the edges, though.",
    "Spray the crushed stone with water to soften it up and remove dust.",
    "To help the stone settle and keep the dust down, use a garden hose to mist the crushed stone.",
    "If you have a spray attachment, use the widest nozzle setting to spread the water out.",
    "Otherwise, use your thumb to press down on the end of the hose and widen the angle of the water.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a hose nearby, you can fill a watering can with water and pour the water over the stone.",
    "Refill the can as needed until you\u2019ve completely soaked your stones.",
    "Too much water is better than too little.",
    "You won\u2019t harm anything by getting the pit wet.",
    "Compact the crushed stone with a hand tamper.",
    "Once you\u2019ve misted the crushed stone, use your hand tamper to compress the stone.",
    "Lift the tamper up and slam it into the stone to compress it.",
    "Repeat this process for every section of stone that you\u2019ve laid out.",
    "You can use a motorized plate compactor if you prefer.Tip: Motorized plate compactors look like lawn mowers and use a motor to push a horizontal plate into the ground repeatedly.",
    "They\u2019re easier to use than a hand tamper, but you\u2019ll need to rent one from your local home supply store.",
    "It will cost $60-200 to rent a motorized plate compactor.",
    "Adding Your Landscape Fabric Get enough landscaping fabric to cover the area of your pit.",
    "Landscaping fabric is a woven textile material that is used to keep weeds and unwanted plants from growing out of a surface.",
    "It also improves drainage and prevents loose stones from shifting.",
    "Purchase enough landscaping fabric to cover your pit.",
    "You can have it delivered by a landscaping company or purchase it a home supply or gardening store.",
    "Landscaping fabric is sold in bundles based on the square footage (or square meters) of an area.",
    "Use the area of your pit to determine how much landscaping fabric you need.",
    "Spread strips of landscape fabric over your crushed stone.",
    "Take your roll of landscaping fabric and roll it out over a section of crushed stone.",
    "Use scissors, shears, or a utility knife to cut the landscaping fabric to size.",
    "Then, roll another length of landscape fabric next to your first length, overlapping the 4\u20138 in (10\u201320 cm) of your first strip\u2019s edge.",
    "Repeat this process until you\u2019ve covered your entire pit with landscaping fabric.",
    "Use bricks or lengths of wood to hold the landscaping fabric in place if it\u2019s a little windy.",
    "Cut relief lines into the edge of the fabric to fit it around round edges.",
    "If you have any curved edges, cut a 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) line into side of your fabric on the corner where you need it to bend.",
    "This will relieve some of the tension in the fabric and make it easier to fit it around your curve.",
    "Repeat this process as many times as needed to fit the fabric to the shape of your pit.Tip: Don\u2019t worry if there are some pleats or small openings in the fabric.",
    "So long as the majority of your pit is filled and the gaps aren\u2019t particularly big, the fabric will work just fine.",
    "If some of the fabric sticks out past the sides of your pit, use scissors, shears, or a utility knife to trim the excess fabric off.",
    "Use bricks to weigh the fabric down and pull it tight.",
    "Once your fabric is laid out and all of your round edges are covered, use bricks or lengths of wood to weigh the fabric down around the edges of your pit.",
    "Then, gently pull on the ends of the fabric to stretch it out and fit it to the surface of your crushed stone.",
    "This will ensure that the fabric stays taut and doesn\u2019t shift your gravel around after it has been poured.",
    "You can use any heavy item to weigh the fabric down so long as it doesn\u2019t tear the fabric.",
    "Pin the fabric in place using spikes or large pins.",
    "To keep the fabric from sliding around, dig spikes or large pins into the fabric to pin it to the ground.",
    "Place one spike or pin every 2\u20134 feet (0.61\u20131.22 m) around the border of your pit to keep the fabric from shifting.",
    "These spikes and pins are usually sold to keep tents and tarps in place, and you can purchase them at any outdoor goods store.",
    "This step is optional if you live in an area that doesn\u2019t experience a ton of harsh weather or heavy wind.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about the overlapping seams coming up.",
    "The weight of the gravel will keep them in place.",
    "You can use spikes or pins to keep them in place if you\u2019d like to play it safe, though.",
    "Install edging along the soil if you want a distinct border.",
    "If you want to keep the gravel from rolling out of the pit, get a plastic landscaping border from a landscaping company or gardening store that is at least 5\u20136 inches (13\u201315 cm) wide.",
    "To install the edging, spread the border out and place the edge perpendicular to the area where your crushed stone meets the soil.",
    "Hit the top of the border with a hammer to push it 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) into the ground.",
    "Repeat this process by working your way around the edges until border covers the entirety of your pit.",
    "Alternatively, you can place heavy stones along the edges of the soil around your pit.",
    "This is optional.",
    "Some people don\u2019t install a border because they like the look of gravel transitioning into the grass.",
    "Filling the Pit with Gravel Get gravel to cover the remaining 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of your pit.",
    "Pea gravel is the common choice for gravel paths, walkways, and driveways, but you can use any kind of gravel that you\u2019d like.",
    "Buy your gravel from a landscaping company if you want it delivered or pick it up yourself from a home supply store.",
    "Use the same method you used when determining how much crushed stone you need to calculate how much gravel you need to buy.",
    "Gravel typically costs around $5.00 per square foot ($16.00 per square meter).",
    "The label on a bag of gravel lists the square footage (or square meters) that it will cover.",
    "Multiply the length and width of your pit and then double this number to figure out how many bags of gravel you need.",
    "Lay a gravel grid out if you\u2019re pouring gravel for a driveway.",
    "A heavy vehicle will shift the gravel around if you drive on it.",
    "To keep this from happening, purchase a gravel grid from a landscaping company.",
    "Gravel grids are reinforced strips of hard plastic that will distribute weight more evenly.",
    "It basically looks like a hard net that covers your landscaping fabric to stabilize the surface.",
    "It comes in small squares or rolls.",
    "Either roll the strips out or set the squares next to one another.",
    "Place them on top of your landscaping fabric to reinforce it.Tip: Gravel grids can be kind of hard to cut, so feel free to leave 4\u20138 inches (10\u201320 cm) around the edges uncovered if you know you won\u2019t drive over the sides.",
    "Otherwise, you can cut the grid with heavy-duty scissors or shears.",
    "You\u2019ll need to cut each grid length one at a time, though.",
    "You can buy a gravel grid online or from a landscaping company.",
    "Pour the gravel into your pit and spread it out.",
    "Take your bag of gravel and pour it directly into your pit.",
    "Alternatively, you can shovel the gravel across your pit to distribute it more evenly.",
    "Continue adding gravel until you reach \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the rim of your soil.",
    "You can use a ruler or measuring tape to measure your gravel as you pour it if you\u2019d like.",
    "Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t add the perfect amount of gravel at first.",
    "You can always pour more or shovel excess gravel out of the pit.",
    "If you installed a plastic border, leave the 2 inches (5.1 cm) at the top of the border unfilled.",
    "Spread the gravel out with your steel rake to make it even and flat.",
    "Take your rake and flip the head around so that the tines are pointing up away from your pit.",
    "Use the flat edge of your steel rake to spread the gravel around and even it out.",
    "Continue moving the gravel around until your pit, driveway, or walkway is even and level.",
    "Rake your gravel once every 6-12 months as the stones shift around and build up into small mounds.",
    "Do not use the tines of your rake to distribute the gravel.",
    "You may accidentally puncture and pull up the landscaping fabric if you do."
