          "description":"Squeeze 1 drop of a mild liquid dish detergent into 1  c (240 mL) of water. Stir or shake the mixture to mix the soap and water. This solution works well when your main goal is to clean dust, dirt, or grime off your orchid\u2019s leaves. If you have a hard water supply, using a water-based cleaning solution can leave mineral deposits behind on the leaves. If this is the case, try a different method to clean the leaves or make this solution using distilled water instead of tap water. Examine your orchid\u2019s leaves at least once a week for dust, mineral deposits, and signs of pests. Removing dust, mineral deposits, and other grime from the leaves lets them breathe and absorb moisture better, so your orchid will be healthier and happier with regular leaf cleanings."

Mix the juice and water up well to combine the liquids.You can use lime juice instead of lemon juice to make this solution. The acidity in a citrus-based cleaning solution works to clean off mineral deposits left behind by hard water from cleaning or watering with tap water.

This will kill pests like mites, aphids, and mealybugs.Tip: Bugs especially like to live on the undersides of orchid leaves. Make sure you look closely around the edges, veins, and ribs on the bottom sides of the leaves when you\u2019re inspecting them for pests. Don\u2019t ever pour rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide into your orchid\u2019s soil or you can damage the root system. Only use it to clean your orchid\u2019s leaves."
