Slip stitch into the first stitch. To close this round and start the remainder of your pattern, make a slip stitch into the first stitch of your ring, and proceed to the next round. Double Magic Ring Wrap the yarn around the fingers of your left hand twice. Instead of creating a single loop, as you would with a standard magic ring, you will need to create two loops. The tail should be in the back on the right side, while the working yarn should be in the front towards your palm. Note that this is very similar to the standard magic ring, but many prefer the double ring for projects that will see a little more action since a double magic ring provides greater durability. You should wrap the loop around the first two fingers on your non-dominant hand. Pull up a loop. Slide your crochet hook under the two loops of your double ring closest to your fingertips. Grab onto the working end of the yarn and pull it back through to the right, creating a loop on the hook.

The \"double\" portion mainly results from the double loop you made at the beginning of the process. Much of the remaining steps are similar to those you would use for a standard magic ring. Make a starting chain. Grab onto the working end of the yarn and draw it through the loop currently on your hook, creating a single chain stitch. You will usually need one starting chain for a single stitch pattern, two for a half double pattern, two or three for a double pattern, and four for a triple pattern. Pull the ring from your index finger.  Crochet as many stitches as needed. Make as many stitches as required for the first round, according to your pattern's instructions. Pull the tail to tighten the loop. You may not be able to get both rings to close. That's okay; only one needs to close. End the round and connect it to the next round, by putting a Slip stitch into the first stitch of the round.  Alternate Option Make a slip knot. While your initial slip stitch is adjustable, the final ring will not be, so it is important that you make as tight and as closed a loop as possible by making tight, even stitches. Use this as an alternative if you have difficulty creating the magic ring. Chain two. Crochet two chain stitches. Put your first round into the stitch second from the hook. Work your crochet hook through the second stitch away from the hook, which is also the first stitch you created, and create your first round, entirely in that stitch. Slip stitch into the first stitch. To close this round and start the remainder of your pattern, make a slip stitch into the first stitch of your ring, and proceed to the next round.

While this initial slip stitch is adjustable, the final ring will not be. This method might be better suited for patterns that use a double stitch, while the other alternate method mentioned in this article tends to be better for single stitch patterns. Chain four. Crochet a series of four chain stitches to create a starting chain. Slip stitch in the first chain made. In the first chain stitch you made, or the fourth stitch presently from the hook, slip stitch. You should be left with one loop on your crochet hook. Note that this will create a ring, but since this ring is fairly wide open, you will need to add more stitches to help close it more. Chain. Create as many chain stitches as your pattern calls for in the first round using the same method you used to create the other four earlier. Put your first stitch into the center of the ring. All the stitches of your first round (except for the chain stitches you just placed) should go into the ring. Slip stitch in the third chain stitch. Pull tightly on the tail",
