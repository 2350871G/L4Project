    "When you\u2019re ready to make the sherbet, pour the milk base into your ice cream maker.",
    "Churn the mixture according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

    "Any type of metal baking pan will work well for freezing the ice cream.",
    "Make sure to cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap before you place it in the refrigerator.",

    "Transfer the sherbets to individual piping bags and chill.",
    "After you\u2019ve thoroughly mixed each flavor of sherbet, place them in large, individual piping bags.",
    "Place the bags in the freezer, and chill for 30 to 35 minutes or until the sherbet reaches the consistency of soft-serve.",
    "If you don\u2019t have piping bags, place the sherbet in large, sealable plastic bags.",

    "After the sherbet is frozen, you can snip off a corner of the bags for the next step.",
    "Swirl the three flavors into a single freezer-safe container and freeze until firm.",
    "Once the sherbet flavors are chilled to the consistency of soft serve, use the piping bags to swirl the flavors into a single freezer-safe container for a rainbow effect.",
    "Return the sherbet to the freezer, and chill until it is firm enough to scoop."
