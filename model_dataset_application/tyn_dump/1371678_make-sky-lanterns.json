Lighting Your Sky Lantern Light your sky lantern in a safe outdoor location. Sky lanterns can be a fire hazard if they\u2019re not lit in a safe place under the right conditions.

Hold your sky lantern by the wire and light the wax-covered cloth. Hold a lighter to the cloth until it catches fire. Keep holding it once it's lit. You don't want to release it just yet. Continue to hold your lantern right side up until you feel it pulling upward. It will take a few seconds for the fire on the wax-covered cloth to fill up the paper shell with air. Once it does, you should feel the lantern being pulled upward. Release your lantern. Once you feel your lantern being pulled upward, it\u2019s ready to be launched.
