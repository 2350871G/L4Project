Keep kneading until the color is distributed evenly throughout the slime. Add another drop to make the color more noticeable. You can use 1 color or combine colors. For example, you could make blue slime with a drop of blue food coloring, or use a drop of blue and red food coloring for purple slime.Warning: Food coloring will stain your hands, clothes, and other surfaces if it gets on them. Wear disposable vinyl gloves and an old t-shirt or apron while you knead the slime and cover your work surface with paper towels or newspaper."

Then, knead the pigment into your slime until the pigment is distributed evenly throughout the slime. Add more pigment if needed to achieve the desired color. You can use any pigment or eyeshadow color you like to color your slime. Try purple pigment or eyeshadow for purple slime, or a glittery charcoal pigment or eyeshadow for sparkly black slime."

    "Stir the 2 ingredients together with a spoon until the ingredients are well combined.Tip: You can double the amount of water and glue for a larger batch of slime, but make sure that you use the same amount for both and double your liquid starch as well.",
    "Find eyeshadow or pigment powder in your desired color.",
    "Since you'll be scraping the eyeshadow to make powder, make sure that it's one you won't mind permanently ruining.",
    "Alternatively, use any type of colored powder you want, such as scrapbooking pigment powder.",
    "For extra-special slime, consider using glow-in-the-dark pigment powder.",
    "You might find it in a craft store, but you'll have better luck online.",
    "Scrape 1 teaspoon (5 g) of the eyeshadow into the glue-water.",
    "For even better results, scrape the eyeshadow into a plastic baggie first, then smash it with the back of a spoon to turn it into a fine powder.",
    "A little bit goes a long way, so start with 1 teaspoon (5 g).",
    "You can always add more later!",
    "If you're using pigment powder, measure out 1 teaspoon (5 g), and add it into the glue-water.",
    "Stir the powder into the glue-water with a spoon until the color is even.",
    "If the color is not deep enough for you, add 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 g) more eyeshadow or pigment powder, and stir it again.",
    "Make sure that you get all lumps and clumps out!",
    "If a spoon isn't getting all of the lumps and clumps out, switch to a fork or mini whisk instead.",

    "Keep kneading the slime in your hands for 1 minute until it firms up and isn\u2019t as gooey anymore.",
    "If the slime is too firm after kneading it for 1 minute, add 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 mL) of water and then knead it for 1 more minute.",
    "If it's too gooey after kneading it for 1 minute, add 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 mL) of starch and then knead it for 1 more minute.",
    "You can put on a pair of gloves to protect your hands from the eyeshadow or pigment powder before you start kneading.",
    "Keep the slime in a zippered sandwich bag or a sealed container.",
    "The slime should last for about 5 to 7 weeks if you store it properly.",
    "Keep it clean and store it in a plastic container or zippered bag when you are not using it.",

    "Stir them together with a spoon until the consistency is even.",
    "Remove the end cap from a thick washable marker.",
    "Choose a washable marker for your color.",
    "You can use any color you like, or combine 2 or more colors to make a new color.",
    "Grab the end part with a pair of pliers or a wrench and twist it off to remove it.",
    "For example, you could use a red marker for red slime, or combine red and blue markers for purple slime.",
    "For scented slime, use a scented marker.",
    "Remove the felt cartridge.",
    "Tip the marker upside down first and try to slide the felt cartridge out.",
    "If it won't come out, unravel a paper clip, poke 1 end into the felt cartridge, and pull it out.",
    "You can also try using a pair of skinny needle-nose pliers, a toothpick, or a skewer.",
    "This step can get messy, so you might want to wear vinyl gloves while you do this and work over some old newspapers.",
    "Squeeze 1 to 2 drops of color into the glue.",
    "Hold the felt cartridge above the glue, then squeeze it with your fingers.",
    "The ink is very concentrated, so you won't need very much.",

    "Stir the color into the glue.",
    "If the color is not bright enough, squeeze another drop of ink into the glue, and stir it again.",
    "Keep in mind that white school glue slime will always have a slightly pastel shade unless you add a lot of color to it.Tip: When you\u2019re done adding the color, you can throw out the disassembled marker, store the felt in a plastic bag if you want to use it to color slime in the future, or pop the felt cartridge back into the tube and replace the end cap.",
