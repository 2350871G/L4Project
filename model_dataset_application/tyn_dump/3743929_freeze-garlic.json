  "text":" Whole Garlic Select quality garlic bulbs. Remove any dirt you can see just by wiping gently. Toss it inside a resealable freezer bag. Label and date (the date is more important; you can probably see it's a garlic bulb). Use. All you need to do is peel off a clove, peel it and use as normal. It won't take long to thaw but you can grate or chop it (with a sharp knife) while still frozen if you're careful. Chopped Garlic or Whole Cloves Remove the garlic cloves from the bulb. Peel each one. Either leave as a clove or chop into small pieces.  Wrap the cloves or chopped garlic in plastic wrap or foil. Place the wrapped garlic inside a resealable freezer bag. Freeze. Use by breaking off whatever is needed from the chopped mass, or simply take a clove (if the clove has gone mushy, it's only good for cooking that lets it break down even more). The frozen mass can be grated, as can the clove if it has remained intact. Use within six months. Oily Garlic Select a suitable garlic bulb. Separate the cloves from it and peel them. Place the cloves into a food processor or blender. Add oil in the ratio of 2 parts oil to 1 part garlic. Olive oil is a good choice, or a less strong flavored vegetable oil of your choosing. Puree or blend to combine the two ingredients. Transfer to a freezer-proof container with a lid to prevent odor transference. Use. Stick a teaspoon or butter knife in and retrieve as much oily garlic as needed for such things as making pasta sauce, adding garlic flavor to meats, stews and other dishes and for adding to stir-fries or saut\u00e9e-ing.
