For a cube of this size, your paper should be at least 8 in \u00d7 6 in (20 cm \u00d7 15 cm). Construction paper is best for this project because it\u2019s sturdy, but you can also use standard copy paper. If you want to make a cube that\u2019s a different size, start with a rectangle with a length-to-width ratio of 4:1. For instance, if you want to make a cube that measures 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 in (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 cm), draw a 16 in \u00d7 4 in (41 cm \u00d7 10 cm) rectangle to start."

Mark that spot, then, draw a vertical line to divide the rectangle in half. You should see two rectangles that measure 4 in \u00d7 2 in (10.2 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm). Divide each of these rectangles in half again so you have 4 2 in \u00d7 2 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm) squares. If you chose to make a cube that\u2019s a different size, adjust the measurements to divide the original rectangle into 4 even squares."

Do the same thing above the third vertical line, or the line that runs down the center of the rectangle. Then, connect the tops of the two new lines with a horizontal line.

Tip: Try making several cubes, then attach them all to a piece of string to make a fun geometric garland! Folding an Origami Cube Start with 6 sheets of 6 in \u00d7 6 in (15 cm \u00d7 15 cm) origami paper. If you want to make a larger or smaller cube, just use larger or smaller square sheets of paper. You can find origami paper at most craft stores or online. If you don\u2019t have origami paper, you can use regular copy paper that\u2019s been cut into squares instead. Tip: You can use one color, several colors, or even patterned paper to create interesting designs! Fold one sheet of paper in half and open it back up. Place one of the sheets of origami paper in front of you on a flat surface, then fold it upward. Line up the top and bottom edges carefully, then press down on the paper to make a fold. Crease the fold, then reopen the paper. Since the paper is square, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you make this fold from side-to-side or top-to-bottom, but the crease will need to be arranged from top-to-bottom as you continue. Crease the paper into fourths by bringing the edges to the crease you made. After you reopen the sheet of paper, the crease you made will be running down the center. Bring the bottom edge of the paper up to the center fold and crease the paper again. Repeat for the top edge of the paper. Do not unfold the paper after you make these folds. Flip the paper over and bring the bottom left corner to the right edge. Position the paper so that the center opening is facing the table, but turn the paper so the fold is vertical. Grasp the bottom left corner of the paper and fold it up to the paper\u2019s right edge. Make sure the bottom edge of the paper is aligned with the right edge, then press down to crease the fold. The new fold will create a triangular edge on the bottom of your paper. Take the top right corner over to the left side of the paper. Next, repeat the same fold, except this time, you\u2019ll fold the top right corner down to the left side of the paper. The folded sheet should now be shaped like a parallelogram. Fold the top corner down and over to the right corner. Grasp the top corner of the parallelogram and fold it so the tip of the triangle is touching the very right corner of the shape. This move will fold the top triangle in half. Crease the folded edge tightly. It\u2019s okay if the corners of the folded square pop back up. Move the bottom corner up and to the left. Next, fold the bottom triangle in half just like you did with the top triangle. Bring the point of the triangle up to the left angle of the parallelogram and crease the fold tightly. Once you do this, you\u2019ll end up with a small square shape. Repeat all the above steps with the 5 other sheets of paper. Start by folding each sheet of paper in half. Then, continue making the folds until you end up with a small folded square. You should have 6 small squares when you\u2019re finished. Fit the pieces of folded paper together. Each of your squares will have 2 end flaps and a center fold. Slide the end flap of 1 piece of folded paper into the center fold of another piece. Then, slide the end flap of a third piece of paper into the other side of the center fold. As you continue adding the other pieces, you\u2019ll see the shape of a cube starting to emerge. Continue until you\u2019ve connected all of the end flaps from each piece of paper, and you\u2019ll have a cube! You may need to bend the flaps to fit them into the center fold.",
