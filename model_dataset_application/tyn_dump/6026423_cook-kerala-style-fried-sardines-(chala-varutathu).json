  "text":" Cleaning the Sardines Remove the scales using a knife or fish cutters. Slide in the opposite direction of the fish scales. Cut around the gills. Make an incision to clean out the inner parts and threads; these are easily removed by using your fingers. Rinse well with water. Add some crystal salt and lime juice. Rub the fish along with the pan. This will help to minimize the bad odour. Wash fish cleanly with running water. Make 2 to 3 gashes on each side. Drain the water and keep it aside. Cooking the Sardine Fry Grind the ginger, garlic, shallot and black pepper along with turmeric and chilli powder. Grind until it forms a fine paste. Apply the paste to the gashes made in the fish and to the stomach area. Refrigerate it for 10 to 20 minutes. Pour required coconut oil/vegetable oil into the tawa pan. Tilt to spread the oil uniformly across the pan base and sides. Add little curry leaves for good aroma. Shallow fry the fish. You can cover it with a lid to prevent the spluttering from escaping. Flip the fish pieces after 5 to 6 minutes of cooking. Remove from the flame or heat when it's crispy. Cover the fried fish in a piece of banana leaf/plantain leaf and add curry leaves for a delicious aroma.  Serve hot with rice. ",
