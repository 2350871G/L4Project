Squeeze the handles together firmly together and pull the jaws toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation. Repeat the process on the end of the other wire you\u2019re splicing as well. You can get wire strippers from your local hardware store. If you don\u2019t have a wire stripper, you can also slice through the insulation with a utility knife. Just be careful not to cut through the actual wire inside. If you accidentally break strands off of a stranded wire, then the wire could cause a fuse to blow. Cut any remaining strands on the wire and try stripping it again."

Cut a piece of tubing that\u2019s at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) long so it\u2019s able to cover the splice and some of the insulation later on. Slide the heat-shrink tubing onto one of the wires and move it at least 1 foot (30 cm) away from the exposed end. You can buy heat-shrink tubing from your local hardware store or online. Avoid using heat-shrink tubing that\u2019s too large for the wire since you may not be able to secure it completely.

Opt for 63/37 solder when you\u2019re working with electronics so you can connect the wires together easily. Lead can be harmful if you consume it, so make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after you solder with it. You can wear gloves if you want, but they aren\u2019t required since you won\u2019t be working with the solder for very long.
