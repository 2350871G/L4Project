You can also check your knitting pattern (if you are using one) to see what size is recommended. For example, if you are knitting a hat and the finished circumference will be 20 in (51 cm), then you might go with a pair of 16 in (41 cm) circular needles. If the cable is too long for the item you want to knit, then you will not be able to complete the project properly. It will also make it much harder for the stitches to move around the cable."

For example, if you are using a pair of US size 7 (4.5 mm) circular knitting needles, then use the same size double-pointed needles."
