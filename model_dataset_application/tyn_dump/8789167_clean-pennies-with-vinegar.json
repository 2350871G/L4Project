This process will work best on coins that are heavily tarnished or have a lot of stuck-on grime. The combination of vinegar and salt will cut through dirt and buildup effortlessly. Vinegar is most effective for cleaning copper. Other coins are molded from different metals, so the solution may not work as well on them. If you don\u2019t have any vinegar on hand, a 1:1 ratio of water to acetone will produce the same effect."

For best results, use a pure, potent type of vinegar, such as distilled white vinegar. Make sure you select a container that isn\u2019t made of metal. The chemical reaction created by mixing salt and vinegar can also react with other types of metals, potentially causing rust, discoloration or mild corrosion."
