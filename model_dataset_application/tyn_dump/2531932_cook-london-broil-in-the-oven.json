If you like your beef rare, aim for a total cook time of about 8 minutes (or 4 minutes per side). Steaks broiled for 10 minutes will typically come out medium-rare. For a medium-well finish, plan on leaving your London broil in for a full 12 minutes. Set a timer to help you keep track of how long the steak has been cooking."

For a more accurate sense of when your London broil is ready to eat, use a meat thermometer to test its internal temperature. As a rule, red meat should be cooked to a minimum of 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Try to avoid overcooking your London broil.

This will give it a chance for the juices to settle and the meat to cool to a safe temperature. Avoid handling either the pan or the meat itself in the meantime, as they\u2019ll both be extremely hot. When it comes time to enjoy your London broil, carve it into thin slices against the natural grain of the meat, or cut a bite at a time the way you would an ordinary steak.

This will create a small packet to trap heat and prevent the flavorful juices from escaping as the meat cooks. Make sure the packet is loosely bundled. While you want to lock in as much heat as possible, it\u2019s important for air to be able to circulate inside the foil, as well.

    "Remove the steak from the refrigerator and pour out the marinade.",
    "Alternatively, you can hold onto your marinade and use it to baste the meat as it cooks.",
    "Avoid brushing reused marinade onto cooked meat, as this could contaminate it with harmful bacteria.",
    "Transfer the steak to the broiler pan.",
    "Carefully arrange the marinated meat on the rack at the bottom of the pan.",
    "Position the steak so that it\u2019s lying as flat as possible to prevent it from shifting and ensure that it cooks through evenly.",
    "Broil the steak under direct heat for 4-6 minutes.",
    "Slide the pan into the oven directly under the broiler.",
    "In order for the meat to get done evenly, it will need to be heated for the same amount of time on both sides.",
    "If you like your beef rare, aim for a total cook time of about 8 minutes (or 4 minutes per side).",
    "Steaks broiled for 10 minutes will typically come out medium-rare.",
    "For a medium-well finish, plan on leaving your London broil in for a full 12 minutes.",
    "Set a timer to help you keep track of how long the steak has been cooking.",
    "Turn the steak and continue cooking for another 4-6 minutes.",
    "Pull the pan partially out of the oven and flip the meat over using a meat fork or a pair of tongs.",
    "Then, reset your timer for the same amount of time as the first side.",
    "This can be a good opportunity to baste your London broil with leftover marinade, if desired.",
    "Always grip the broiler pan with a potholder to protect your hands from the heat.",
    "Check to see whether the meat is done.",
    "Cut into the thickest part of the steak and take a look at the color inside.",
    "A deep red center indicates that it's rare, while a warm pink one may range from medium-rare to medium.",
    "A dry, brown center meant it's well-done.",
    "For a more accurate sense of when your London broil is ready to eat, use a meat thermometer to test its internal temperature.",
    "As a rule, red meat should be cooked to a minimum of 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C).",
    "Try to avoid overcooking your London broil.",
    "The more done it gets, the less juicy and flavorful it will be once it comes out.",
    "Let the meat rest for about 10 minutes before serving.",
    "Remove the pan from the oven and set it on a nearby cooktop or other heat-safe surface.",
    "This will give it a chance for the juices to settle and the meat to cool to a safe temperature.",
    "Avoid handling either the pan or the meat itself in the meantime, as they\u2019ll both be extremely hot.",
    "When it comes time to enjoy your London broil, carve it into thin slices against the natural grain of the meat, or cut a bite at a time the way you would an ordinary steak.",
    "If you end up with leftovers, place them in an airtight storage container and stash them in the refrigerator.",
    "When stored properly, they should keep for 3-4 days.",
    "Using a Conventional Oven Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C).",
    "Set the oven to \u201cBake,\u201d or use \u201cConvection\u201d to decrease your overall cook time by 5-10 minutes.",
    "To make the best use of your time, allow the oven to begin heating up while you finish preparing the meat.",
    "If you decide to go with convection, reduce the temperature of the oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) to account for the more efficient heating.",
    "That way, the outside of the steak won't get done before the inside.",
    "Wrap the marinated meat in aluminum foil and place it on a baking sheet.",
    "After draining the  marinade from the steak, place it in the middle of a large sheet of heavy-duty foil.",
    "Fold both sides over the top to seal it up.",
    "This will create a small packet to trap heat and prevent the flavorful juices from escaping as the meat cooks.",
    "Make sure the packet is loosely bundled.",
    "While you want to lock in as much heat as possible, it\u2019s important for air to be able to circulate inside the foil, as well.",
    "If desired, you can also add a small handful of chopped vegetables to the foil before closing it up.",
    "Sliced bell peppers, onions, and other veggies that cook relatively quickly make good choices.",
    "Cook the steak for 45-50 minutes.",
    "Slide the baking dish onto one of the oven\u2019s center racks.",
    "Shut the door and set a timer so you\u2019ll know how long the meat has been cooking.",
    "Since the oven\u2019s conventional settings heat more evenly than the broiler, there\u2019s no need to turn the steak as it cooks.",
    "After cooking for 45-50 minutes, you London broil will be about medium.",
    "Knock off 12-15 minutes if you'd prefer your meat a little rare, or add an extra 10-15 to get it closer to well done.",
    "Remove the London broil from the oven and unwrap the foil packet.",
    "Carefully peel back one corner of the packet, lifting the foil towards you so that the steam escapes in the opposite direction.",
    "Once most of the steam has dissipated, finish unfolding the rest of the packet.",
    "Be careful when unwrapping the foil packet\u2014the steam that escapes will be very hot.",
    "If necessary, grab a pair of tongs or a thick oven mitt to protect your hands.",
    "At this point, you can cut into the steak to make sure it's done to your liking.",
    "Let your London broil rest for 5-10 minutes before enjoying.",
    "Once it\u2019s had time to cool, cut the meat into thin slices, making sure to run your knife against the grain.",
    "Drizzle the juices collected at the bottom of the foil packet over the meat for even more flavor.",
    "Store any uneaten portions of meat in an airtight container in your refrigerator and consume them within 3-4 days.",
    "Pan-Searing London Broil Preheat the oven to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C).",
    "For this method, you\u2019ll start by browning the outside of your London broil in a hot skillet, then finish cooking it through in the oven.",
    "It\u2019s a good idea to bring the oven to the correct temperature while you\u2019re busy searing the meat.",
    "For steaks thicker than about 1.5\u20132 inches (3.8\u20135.1 cm), bump the oven temperature up to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).",
    "Dual-method cooking works especially well for thicker cuts of meat, as it reduces total cooking time.",
    "The less time the steak spends inside a hot oven, the juicier it will turn out.",
    "Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a large skillet.",
    "Pour in the oil, then tilt the pan in every direction until the cooking surface is evenly coated.",
    "Warm the skillet on the cooktop for 3-4 full minutes so that it\u2019s nice and hot.",
    "When the oil begins to shimmer slightly, you can go ahead and add the steak.",
    "For techniques like pan-searing that utilize intense heat, it\u2019s best to pick an oil with a high smoke point, such as pure olive oil or canola.",
    "Note that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) does NOT have a high smoke value.",
    "Brown the steak for 2-3 minutes on each side.",
    "Add the marinated meat to the hot skillet, pressing it flat against the cooking surface.",
    "Take a peek at the underside of the steak after the first 2-3 minutes to see whether it\u2019s properly seared.",
    "Once it's taken on a deep reddish-brown color with a slightly crusty finish, turn it over and continue browning for an additional 2-3 minutes.",
    "To prevent splatters, allow the meat to reach room temperature before searing and lower it into the pan using a fork or pair of tongs.",
    "Place the seared steak in the oven for 15-20 minutes.",
    "Remove the skillet from the cooktop and transfer it to the center rack of the oven.",
    "Allow the meat to cook until it reaches the desired doneness.",
    "This shouldn't take too long, since you already got it started on the stove.",
    "Check to make sure the skillet you\u2019re doing your searing with is often-safe before you put it in.",
    "Not all cookware is designed to withstand the heat of the oven.",
    "Make a shallow cut near the center of the steak or use a meat thermometer to test its internal temperature.",
    "Anything below 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) is rare, while 155\u2013160 \u00b0F (68\u201371 \u00b0C) is medium and 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) and above is well done.",
    "Rest your London broil for 5 minutes.",
    "Switch off the oven.",
    "Remove the skillet and set it on the cooktop or another heat-safe surface to cool.",
    "In a few short minutes, it will be the perfect temperature for eating, with a crisp, caramelized exterior and tender, juicy center.",
    "Always use an oven mitt or towel anytime you take hot cookware out of the oven.",
    "Pan-seared foods are always best when enjoyed fresh.",
    "However, your leftover London broil will do just fine when kept in an airtight container the refrigerator.",
    "For the best flavor and texture, try to use it up within 3-4 days.",
