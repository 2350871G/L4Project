If the string crosses the rim at 150\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 150-90=60\u00ba. The angle of elevation will always be less than 90\u00ba since 90\u00ba is straight up in the sky.

Tape a straight, plastic drinking straw on or near the straight edge of the protractor. Make sure the straw passes through the two 0\u00ba or zero marks on opposite ends of the straight edge. If you don't have a straw, roll a piece of paper into a tight cylinder and use that instead. Tie a string through the small hole on the straight edge. Many protractors come with a small hole directly between the 0\u00ba marks on the protractor, across from the 90\u00ba mark on the curved edge of the protractor. If your protractor does not have a small hole here, or if the hole is not situated correctly, tape or glue the string to the protractor where the hole should be.

Do not try to punch a hole in a plastic protractor, as it is probably made from weak plastic and could shatter. Attach a small weight to the dangling end of the string. Tie a paper clip, metal washer, or other small weight to the end of the string. When you hold the clinometer so the string falls past the circular rim of the protractor, the weight will pull the string straight down past an angle mark on the protractor, such as 60\u00ba. This tells you what angle the clinometer is being held at, which can be used to find the heights of distant objects as described in the section below. Using a Protractor Clinometer Sight the top of a tall object through the straw. Hold the clinometer so the curved rim of the protractor is facing downward. Tilt the clinometer until you can look through the straw or paper tube and see the top of a tall object you want to measure, such as a building. You can use this method to measure the angle between you and the top of that object, or the object's height. Measure the angle using the protractor. Keep the clinometer steady in that position, until the dangling string becomes still. Calculate the angle between the midpoint of the protractor (90\u00ba), and the point where the string crosses the rim by subtracting one from the other. For example, if the string crosses the rim at 60\u00ba, the angle of elevation between you and the top of the object is 90\u201360=30\u00ba. If the string crosses the rim at 150\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 150-90=60\u00ba. The angle of elevation will always be less than 90\u00ba since 90\u00ba is straight up in the sky. The answer will always be positive (greater than 0\u00ba). If you subtract the larger number from the smaller and get a negative number, just cross out the minus sign to get the right answer. For example, if you calculate that 60-90=-30\u00ba, the actual angle of elevation is +30\u00ba. Calculate the tangent of this angle. The tangent of an angle is defined as the side of a right triangle opposite the angle, divided by the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the triangle is formed by three points: you, the base of the object, and the top of the object.

Measure your distance from the object. If you want to find out how tall the object is, you'll need to know how far away you are from its base. Measure using a tape measure. If you don't have one, count the number of ordinary steps it takes to get to the object, then measure the length of one step once you find a ruler. The total distance is the length of one step multiplied by the number of steps you took. Some protractors have rulers marked along the straight edge. Use your measurements to calculate the height of the object. Remember, the tangent of your angle is (object's height) / (distance between you and the object). Multiply the tangent by the distance you measured, and you'll be left with just the object's height! For example, if the angle of elevation was 35\u00ba, and your distance from the object was 45 units, the object's height equals 45 x tangent(35\u00ba), or 31.5 units. Add your own height at eye level to your answer, since that's how far your clinometer was above the ground.",

    "You can use a scientific or graphing calculator, an online tangent calculator, or a chart listing tangents for various angles.",
    "To calculate the tangent on a calculator, press TAN and enter the angle you found.",
    "If the answer is below 0 or above 1, set your calculator to degrees instead of radians and try again.",
    "Measure your distance from the object.",
    "If you want to find out how tall the object is, you'll need to know how far away you are from its base.",
    "Measure using a tape measure.",
    "If you don't have one, count the number of ordinary steps it takes to get to the object, then measure the length of one step once you find a ruler.",
    "The total distance is the length of one step multiplied by the number of steps you took.",
    "Some protractors have rulers marked along the straight edge.",
    "Use your measurements to calculate the height of the object.",
    "Remember, the tangent of your angle is (object's height) / (distance between you and the object).",
    "Multiply the tangent by the distance you measured, and you'll be left with just the object's height!",
    "For example, if the angle of elevation was 35\u00ba, and your distance from the object was 45 units, the object's height equals 45 x tangent(35\u00ba), or 31.5 units.",
    "Add your own height at eye level to your answer, since that's how far your clinometer was above the ground."
