Add the kosher salt, and use a spoon to stir the water for 1-2 minutes or until the salt is completely dissolved. This will create a basic brine that will moisten and add flavor to the trout.

The skin on the fillets will be shiny or slightly sticky when ready. If the skin does not seem shiny or sticky, then continue to refrigerate the fillets until the skin appears shiny. The tackiness is key to getting the smoke flavor to adhere to the meat. To make the baking rack easier to transport, set it inside of a baking sheet.
