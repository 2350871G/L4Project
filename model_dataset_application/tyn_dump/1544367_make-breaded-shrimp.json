(5 ml) salt, 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) pepper, 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) onion powder. Stir well until combined. In a third bowl add 1 cup (240 ml) of Japanese style breadcrumbs or another kind of crumb to form the crispy breading of the shrimp. Japanese style breadcrumbs are made from crust-less bread and they are lighter and flakier than conventional breadcrumbs."

When the shrimp are ready, take 1 shrimp and dredge it in the seasoned flour mixture and make sure the shrimp is evenly covered. Then coat the shrimp in the egg wash and then press it gently into the crumb mixture. The flour and egg will act as glue, allowing the breading to adhere to the shrimp.
