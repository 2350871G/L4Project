If you used 5 ounces of paint, for instance, you\u2019ll want to add somewhere between 18 and 24 ounces of water. Test the wash using scrap wood sticks before you begin painting.

For example, a splash of mint green can turn a basic sky blue wash to a more retro-looking seafoam. Similarly, hints or orange and opal will upgrade an ordinary red to sun-baked brick. Mixing your paints allows for a much greater degree of customization and control over the finished piece. Neutral colors like dark gray and white can be used to darken or lighten the overall shade of a wash, respectively. Blending different colored paints can result in one-of-a-kind finishes that will make your furniture even more distinguished."

Distress as much or as little as you like before the wash dries to give the piece some added aesthetic character.

Use color washes to lend interest and enchantment to other pieces around your home! Clear coats protect against scratches, humidity and natural deterioration and can be reapplied as they wear out over time.
