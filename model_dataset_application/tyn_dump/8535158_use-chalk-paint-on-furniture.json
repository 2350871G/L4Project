If you find any, use a filler like Elmer\u2019s Wood Filler and a putty knife to close up the gouges. You can also leave these marks if you would prefer a more dated and worn look."

You can choose any color you\u2019d like, however, keep in mind that depending on the color of the item you\u2019re painting, you may have to put on additional coats. For example, if you are working with darker colored furniture like a deep mahogany or black metal, you may need to apply three to four coats of a lighter paint. However, chalk paint goes on thick and dries quickly, so even multiple coats won\u2019t take long. A four ounce container should also be more than enough. The most popular chalk paint comes from Annie Sloan, but you can also make your own with just latex paint, water, and baking powder."

For example, if you are working with a dresser or items with drawers, you can add painter\u2019s tape to the side of each to keep them clear. Of course, if you want to paint the entire piece, then painter\u2019s tape is unnecessary."

Then add another layer and allow that to dry as well. Check for any bleed through of the color beneath the paint. If you don\u2019t see any, feel free to continue. Woods like cherry and mahogany are prone to bleeding through paint and may need to be coated in shellac first. Try a spray shellac like Bull\u2019s Eye and apply two to three coats before painting. The shellac should only take an hour to dry."
