Remove any colors of stain that you do not like with paint thinner and rags. Once you have chosen your stain color, you are ready to start with the preparation process. Oak Cabinet Preparation Set up a work station in your home. Remove all the items from the cabinets and place them out of the way. Since most cabinets are secured directly into the walls, the work will need to be done inside the house with good ventilation. Remove the door and drawer pulls from the cabinet doors. Set them aside in a safe place until the end of the project. Remove the hinges from the doors. Then, remove the drawers. You can choose to work on the doors and drawers outside in a garage, if you desire. Open the windows and employ a fan through the next stages of the process. This is important whether you are staining the base and wall cabinets in the home or doors and drawers in the garage. Apply tri-sodium phosphate (TSP) cleaner to all surfaces of the cabinetry. Apply with a sponge or a scrub pad. If possible, find a no-rinse type of TSP for easy application. Scrub well and allow it to dry completely. Apply painter's tape to any sections of cabinetry that are touching the wall. Place drop cloths over appliances if you cannot remove them. Scuff sand the surface off all the cabinetry with fine-grit sandpaper. Buy 150 to 180-grit sandpaper and sand sponges. You are not trying to remove the stain itself; however, you are trying to create a scuffed surface for the stain to stick to. Wipe the surfaces of all cabinets with tack cloths. Remove fallen dust with a vacuum. Apply a liquid sander. Also known as surface deglosser, this liquid can be applied with rags in order to clean and create a better surface to absorb the stain. Allow it to dry for at least 1 hour. Oak Cabinet Staining Apply the stain on the cabinets with 1 inch (2.5 cm) strokes. Use a very light coat and a light touch. Apply to adjacent areas in order to blend as you go. Remove any excess stain from the brush with a rag. Remember to use more care with applying gel stain than you usually would with wood stain.
