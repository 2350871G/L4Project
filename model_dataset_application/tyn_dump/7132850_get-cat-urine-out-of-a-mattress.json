    "Inside, set up a fan and point it at the mattress to help speed up the drying time.",
    "The mattress may take two to three days to dry completely.",
    "To sleep on the mattress before it\u2019s dry, cover the affected area with one or two towels, followed by a plastic bag.",
    "Make the bed as usual.",
    "Remove the towels in the morning to let the mattress continue air drying.",
    "Sweep or brush, the area to remove baking soda.",
    "Do NOT vacuum it up.",
    "Baking soda will pass through your vacuum's filters and end up in the motor.",
    "And then your vacuum will eventually die.",
    "When the baking soda has clumped together and absorbed all the liquid it can, use a brush or broom to clean it off the mattress.",
    "If the mattress is still wet, you can add more baking soda to keep drawing out moisture and odors.",
    "Preventing Your Cat from Urinating on the Bed Take a trip to the vet to address medical issues.",
    "A medical problem could be causing your cat to urinate somewhere other than the litter box.",
    "To eliminate this possibility, and to treat your cat if something is wrong, take your pet to the vet and tell the vet your cat urinated outside the litter box.",
    "Possible medical causes for this include:\nDiabetes\nArthritis pain\nBladder or kidney stones\nUrinary tract infections\nHyperthyroidism Reduce your cat\u2019s stress levels.",
    "Anxiety is another common problem that could cause your cat to urinate outside of the litter box.",
    "There are lots of things that can stress cats out, but if anxiety is the problem, you will have to help calm your cat to prevent this from happening again.",
    "Common causes of feline stress and anxiety are:\nNew additions to the family, such as a new baby or another pet.",
    "If this is the case, give your cat a safe space to retreat to and work on reintroducing the newcomer and the cat again.",
    "Other cats or animals roaming outside your house.",
    "In that case, keep your cat inside, and take measures to deter the other animals from coming around.",
    "Diet can also cause cat stress, especially if your cat is on a restrictive diet.",
    "Talk to your vet about the best course of action if you suspect diet is the problem.",
    "Not enough play time or attention.",
    "While cats are solitary creatures, they still need attention.",
    "Dedicate time each day to playing with, brushing, and petting your cat.",
    "Provide your cat with an extra litter box.",
    "A good rule of thumb is to have one litter box per cat in the house, plus an extra.",
    "This can be especially important if your cat is older, has trouble getting to the bathroom quickly, or is starting to have trouble with stairs.",
    "In that case, make sure there's a litter box on each level of the house.",
    "Place a litter box in two of the cat\u2019s favorite rooms if your house has one floor.",
    "Clean the litter box more often.",
    "Cats are very clean animals, and they may stop using their litter boxes if the boxes aren't cleaned out often enough.",
    "Some cats will even refuse to use the litter box unless it\u2019s cleaned out after each use.",
    "You should be scooping the litter box once a day, and clumping litter should be changed out every two to three weeks.",
    "Consider a litter box with shorter sides for an older cat.",
    "Older cats can get joint pain and arthritis.",
    "When it comes to using a litter box with high sides, getting in and out and using the box can be painful.",
    "Try a litter box with shorter sides and see if that makes a difference.",
    "Keep your cat out of the bedroom.",
    "One of the simplest solutions for stopping your cat from urinating on the bed is to keep the cat out of the bedrooms.",
    "This is especially important if you're allergic to your cat, since urine is one of the triggers for allergies.",
    "Pay attention to whether the cat starts to mark elsewhere, however.",
    "Preventing the cat from getting into your room may stop it from urinating on the bed, but it may start to mark somewhere else, especially if the underlying cause wasn\u2019t addressed.",
    "Install plastic mattress covers.",
    "These are great for keeping your mattress safe from all sorts of spills, including urine, beverages, and other liquids that could stain and cause bad odors.",
    "The plastic covers are like fitted sheets that go over top of the mattress, and then you make the bed as usual over the plastic sheet.",
    "If your cat does urinate on the mattress again, strip the bed, launder the sheets, and use an all-purpose cleaner and a cloth to wipe the plastic."
