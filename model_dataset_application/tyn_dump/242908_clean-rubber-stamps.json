A plus-side of having these wipes available is that they\u2019re gentle enough to clean the ink off of your hands as well. This method won\u2019t be as effective for cleaning off permanent inks. Avoid any cleaning wipes containing alcohol, since this will dry out the rubber and you may damage the stamp with repeated use."

          "description":"Take an individual moist baby wipe and fold it in half twice so that the sheet is folded into quarters. The layers will create a bit of depth and cushioning for your stamp. Place the wipe on a paper towel or a plastic surface to catch any drips and ink. Then press the dirty stamp firmly down into the baby wipe a few times until the ink has been removed. This technique is perfect for small stamps measuring less than 2 in (5.1 cm) across, and for cleaning just a couple stamps at a time."

When you\u2019re ready to clean your stamps, lift off the lid and press a dirty stamp directly into the stack of baby wipes. Blot it a handful of times until the ink transfers from the stamp to the wipe. This trick can be especially handy if you do a lot of stamping or if you\u2019re trying to clean larger stamps measuring larger than 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) across."

          "headline":"Scrub a stamp gently using a single baby wipe.",
          "description":"If you can\u2019t get the ink out the stamp\u2019s crevices, it can be helpful to wipe the stamp directly instead of blotting it. Position your stamp rubber-side up and massage a moist baby wipe gently into the stamp using your fingertips. Once part of the wipe gets inky, reposition it so you\u2019re using a clean portion. To clean out little areas of detail, try balling up a corner of the baby wipe and pressing it down into the rubber to squeeze some of the wipe\u2019s moisture into deeper crevices. Create a more bristly texture by placing an old toothbrush or a manicure brush behind the baby wipe. Work in a circular scrubbing motion and press the bristles into the grooves of the stamp."

Firmly pat the clean stamp a few times on the dry cloth to soak up the moisture from the baby wipe. Higher-pile washcloths work well since they can reach deeper into the grooves of a stamp. Try folding up the corner of a piece of paper towel and pressing it into the stamp to absorb any remaining drops of water."

To moisten a dried-out wipe, dampen it slightly with a few drops of tap water. Squeeze the dampened wipe gently to distribute the water and it will be ready to use right away. Discard a dirty wipe once all sides are inky."

Just be sure to place the blotting material in a tray to catch any drips. Pick up a paint edging pad from a home improvement store. The bristles on the pad will provide lots of texture for deeper stamp scrubbing. Try using a dense sponge. Car-washing sponges and scrubbers will hold up better than kitchen sponges to the friction of the stamp. Create your own blotting pad with car absorber towels. Cut the towels into squares and stack them in layers within an airtight container."

If you spray the stamp cleaner onto the left side, for instance, you\u2019ll be able to use the right side for drying off the stamp. For future usage, try to use the same side for spraying each time. Some stamp scrubbers feature a notch in one of the pads to help you remember. Or you could label each side with a piece of tape and a permanent marker so you don\u2019t get them mixed up."
