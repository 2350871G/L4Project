If you don\u2019t want to bother with moving your plants every time you mist them, try draping a towel or drop cloth over anything in the area that you want to protect from the mist.

The sides of the container don\u2019t necessarily have to be as tall as the plant, but steeper sides will hold in more humidity. If you decide to plant directly in the glass container, add a little gravel to the bottom beneath the soil to improve drainage. Using a glass container for planting also makes it easier to tell by looking when your plants need to be watered.
