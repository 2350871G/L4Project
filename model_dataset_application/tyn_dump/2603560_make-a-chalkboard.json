The size of the frame will be the finished size of your chalkboard. When selecting a frame, choose one that still has its backing.

  "text":" Choosing and Preparing the Frame Choose a picture frame based on your desired chalkboard size. You can repurpose an old frame, pick something up at a second-hand shop, or buy something new for this project. The size of the frame will be the finished size of your chalkboard. When selecting a frame, choose one that still has its backing. The backing isn't necessary, but it will help you secure the chalkboard later. You can also use a framed mirror, as long as you can pop the mirror out. Take the glass or plexiglass out of the frame. It should slide right out. You will not be using the glass for this project, but if you enjoy crafting, you might want to save it among your crafting supplies for a future project. If you dispose of the glass, take precautions to ensure that it doesn't hurt anyone. You can either recycle it or throw it away, but if you throw it away, wrap it in several layers of cloth rag or plastic bag first. Sand the frame down. If the frame is in ragged condition, lightly sand it down with fine-grain sandpaper. Temporarily remove the backing to prevent it from getting dirty or damaged as you sand. Wipe down the frame.

Apply the paint with the grain, not against it. You can also use spray paint for faster, easier application. Allow the paint to dry in between coats. Aim for 2-3 coats for full and even coverage. Stain a wooden frame, alternatively. You could apply wood staining, too, as long as the frame is made with natural wood. Do not prime the wood before staining it and use a soft bristle paintbrush to apply it. Apply the stain with the grain, not across it. Allow the stain to dry in between coats. Applying Chalkboard Paint to the Board Trace a rectangle onto medium-density fiberboard. The rectangle must be the same size as the opening of the frame. If the frame is new, take out the paper insert that comes with it and trace the outline onto your board. You can also trace the inside glass window. Draw the outline on the board using a pencil. If you have an old frame with no glass, use a ruler to measure the back opening of the frame. Draw a rectangle with the same dimensions on your board.

After cutting the board, use rough sandpaper to remove any splintering edges around the perimeter. You may also need to use the sandpaper to shave away some of the board if it will not fit into the frame perfectly. Apply one coat of white latex primer to one side of the board. Use a large sponge brush or standard flat painter's brush to brush on a coat of primer. Let the primer dry completely before applying the chalkboard paint. The primer will make it easier for the paint to stick to the surface of the board. Paint the board with two coats of chalkboard paint. Use a painter's brush or roller to apply two even coats of black chalkboard paint to the primed board. Even coats will reduce the amount of ridges that develop on the surface after the paint dries.

It should slide right in, similar to if you were replacing the glass in the frame. Secure the chalkboard in place. If the backing will fit inside the frame with the board, slide it behind the board to secure everything in place. If you cannot use the backing, use masking tape or packing tape to fix the back of the board to the back of the frame. Hang the chalkboard by the hook attached to the frame's backing. Alternatively, you could use heavy staples to attach thick twine or thin rope to the top two corners of the frame and hang the chalkboard on a hook using this string. Creating Variations Create a magnetic chalkboard with metal sheeting instead of plywood. Trim a thin sheet of galvanized sheet metal down to size using tin snips. The metal should be the same size as your plywood would be if creating an ordinary chalkboard. Coat the metal with several layers of chalkboard spray paint. Wear gloves when handling the metal to avoid getting cut. Use the backing of the frame or another piece of board to secure the sheet metal in place. Glue magnets on the back if you want to hang your board on the fridge. If you plan to hang your framed chalkboard on a magnetic surface, like your fridge, fix moderately strong magnets to the four corners of the frame. Use super glue or another strong adhesive to secure the magnets in place. Apply chalkboard paint on other flat surfaces. Any flat, smooth surface can be turned into a blackboard simply by adding a few layers of chalkboard paint. Lightly sand the surface, if necessary, and apply painter's tape to cover any area you do not want to get paint on. Consider using enamel bakeware, old cabinet doors, an old mirror, a glass window pane, or a dustpan. Make a lightweight chalkboard with foam board. Use foam board instead of plywood or medium-density fiberboard. Cut it out as usual and paint it with two coats of chalkboard paint. Note that this will not be a very durable chalkboard.
