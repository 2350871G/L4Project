There are two R-rating scales, one US customary and one metric; the US scale is 5.68 times the metric scale so it should be obvious which one is being used. It's usually recommended that existing homes have their attics insulated to a rating of R-38 (US), which will typically require a layer of insulation 10\u201314 inches (25.4\u201335.6 cm) thick, depending on what type of insulation you use. If you're adding on to existing insulation, use this rule of thumb to guide your work: Once joists are level with, or slightly below, your level of insulation, the total should be adequate for an R-38 rating. Less than that, and you'll probably need to add more. Past a certain thickness, it may not be cost-effective to add more insulation even if you aren't sure your attic is at the R-38 level. If your existing insulation is more than about 10 inches (25.4 cm) thick, it might not be worth the extra money."

          "description":"There are a few different kinds of insulation available for your attic project. Choose whichever option works best for you in terms of cost, ease of installation, and effectiveness. Batting insulation comes in low, medium, and high-density batts. The higher a bat's density, the less is required to reach your target R-rating. Batting is convenient and can be rolled out easily into rectangular spaces. Most batting is made of mineral wool or fiberglass, which requires protective gear to work with safely. Safer batting made from recycled foam is also available, though. Loose fill insulation comes in bags and is used to insulate odd corners or angles where batting insulation won't fit as well. It can be hand-packed, but blowing it into place with a special machine makes it more even and complete."
