          "description":"Most propane torches consist of a small gas tank fitted with a regulator, with or without an electric igniter. If yours doesn't have an igniter, you'll need to use a striker to light the torch. If you need low heat, opt for a propane torch with a flame-spreading tip, which will allow you to diffuse the flame to lower its heat. When using a high heat for repairing chain-link fences and the like, consider using an oxygen-fuel torch. These torches have 2 separate tanks for gas (usually propane or MAPP) and oxygen."

          "headline":"Wear appropriate safety gear.",
          "description":"Before using the propane torch, you should put on a pair of heavy work gloves and safety glasses. It is also best to wear long sleeves and pants. Your propane torch should only ever be used in well ventilated areas. Be cautious of wind when using your torch. It can cause the flame to jump and catch unintended things on fire. Never ignite your torch near flammable material. Avoid clothing that is loose or hangs. Loose or hanging clothing is more likely to accidentally catch on fire when operating a torch."

If your torch has an electric igniter, pull the trigger to ignite the gas. This may take several tries. Some propane torches have a safety trigger that must be depressed when lighting the gas. If you are using your torch indoors, make sure to open a window for ventilation. If using one outdoors, be cautious of the wind causing the flame to jump to flammable objects."

          "description":"Once the propane torch is lit, you can adjust the height of the flame by turning the gas valve. For soldering or other high heat applications, a small flame is best. A larger flame works better for low heat applications. The flame will have a bright inner cone and a more diffuse outer cone. The hottest point of the flame is the very tip of the inner cone."

          "description":"For soldering pipe, place the tip of the inner cone against the joint and hold the torch steady. For loosening rusty bolts, try to focus the flame on the nut only or the surrounding metal. For low heat applications, hold the flame further away from the material and keep the torch in motion. Applying your torch to metal will cause the metal to expand. When loosening bolts, it may be best to heat the surrounding metal to prevent the bolt from expanding."

Separate your torch from the fuel cylinder when you finish using it. This will provide less opportunity for accidents. If you hear leaking gas, check the valve and make sure it is completely closed. If you still hear gas, check for leaks in the fashion explained in the section on troubleshooting your torch."

When the jagged edges of your pipe have been filed down, wipe away any remaining fragments with a clean rag. If you don't have a proper file, substitute fine grain sandpaper, emery cloth, or steel wool to smooth rough edges on your pipe. If your pipe didn't cut cleanly and has jagged edges or burrs, wear work gloves when filing to prevent cuts and slivers."

If this is impossible, use a dry, clean cloth to absorb all water or liquid near where you'll be applying the solder. Water can interfere with the soldering process and create a weak bond in it. Be thorough when drying your pipe."

Water can remain in the line if the pipe is still attached and run to where you are soldering, negatively impacting the bond. Generally, pipe plugs come with an applicator. Use this applicator to push the plug up the pipe. Dissolve the plug when you are done by briefly applying the torch to the area the plug is."

Use the applicator that came with your flux to apply a thin layer of it to the outer surface of the pipe you'll be soldering. If this is your first time soldering pipe, you may apply to much flux initially. Wipe away excess flux with a clean cloth."

First the flux will become shiny, but then the pipe should darken. When the flux sizzles and smokes slightly, the pipe is ready for solder. Be cautious when handling heated pipe. Touching this could result in accidental burn in the same way touching the flame of your torch would. Keep the flame of your torch set to a moderate or low setting when heating flux. You only need a relatively low temperature to melt it."

Twist the pipe back and forth in the fitting to spread the flux on the inside of the joint. Then use your torch to reheat the assembled components. Pass the flame of your torch evenly back and forth over the pipe components. Failing to heat these evenly could cause your solder to melt unevenly, allowing water to leak."

If your components glow or turn a blue color, you've applied too much heat. If you've applied too much heat to your pipe, wait for it to cool completely. When the pipe is cool, try again by repeating this process from the beginning."
