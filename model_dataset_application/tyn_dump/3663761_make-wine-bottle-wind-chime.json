  "text":" Cutting the Bottle Find an empty wine bottle. You can use one from the recycling bin or you can buy a brand new bottle from the craft store. Be sure to wash the bottle with soap and water and remove any labels. Remove the cork and set it aside for a different project. If you are buying a tinted bottle from the craft store, be aware that color usually does not go through the bottle and may chip off. Prepare a pot of boiling water and a pot of iced water. The key to cutting a bottle in half is to dip it between hot and cold water until it comes apart. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Have another pot or bowl filled with iced water close by. Keep the water at a steady boil on the stove. The iced water needs enough ice in it to make it very cold, but not so much ice that you can't stick anything inside it. Score a line around the bottle with a glass saw. Put on a pair of leather work gloves first. Next, place the bottle on a stable surface, then set the saw down next to it. Rotate the bottle as you apply constant, even pressure with the saw, scoring a thin line. Don't worry about cutting the bottle completely in half. You can use a tile saw with a glass blade instead. How far down you make this line is up to you. About 3/4 of the way down from the top would be ideal, however. If you want to, you can use a metal clamp or string as a cutting guide. Dip the bottle in boiling and iced water until the bottom comes off. You only need to dip the bottle deep enough so that the scored line is submerged. Rotate the bottle while it is under the water, sort of like stirring soup with a spoon. Keep doing this until the bottom half of the bottle breaks off. Start with the boiling water, then do the cold. Keep alternating between the 2 pots until the bottom half of the bottle breaks off. How many alternations you do will vary each time. It will depend on various factors, such as the depth of the scored line, the thickness and quality of the glass, etc. Discard the bottom half of the bottle and keep the top. What you do with the bottom half is up to you. You can toss it into the recycling bin, or you can set it aside for another project. For example, you can turn it into a glass jar or cup. If you wish to keep the bottom half, be sure to sand and polish the cut edge. Polish the cut edge with various grits of sandpaper. Hold the sandpaper against a flat surface, like a plate, then rub the cut edge of the bottle against the sandpaper. Start with a coarse grit first, then work your way up to a medium grit, and finally to a fine grit. Keep the bottle wet as you sand it to prevent dust and chipping. The exact grit number does not matter, as long as the packaging says: coarse, medium, and fine. It would be good to finish with a high number, like 400-grit, however. Keep your work gloves on during this step. Don't take them off until after you have finished smoothing the glass. Adding the Hanging Chain Decide how long you want the hanging chain to be. Starting at the base of the bottle's neck, measure towards the top of the bottle. Add this measurement to however long you want your hanging chain to be. For example, if your bottle's neck measures 3 inches (7.6 cm) and you want your hanging chain to be 14 inches (36 cm) long, you should cut the chain down to 17 inches (43 cm). Cut a piece of chain with wire cutters according to this length. The chain should be thin enough so that you can slide it down the neck of the bottle, and delicate enough so that you can cut it with wire cutters. A jewelry chain could work, but the loops need to be big enough so that you can thread a split key ring through them. It is better to cut the chain too long than too short. You can always trim it shorter. Alternatively, you can a length of nylon cording instead. Cut it a little longer than you need it so that you can tie knots into it. Secure a split key ring to the bottom of the chain. Find a split key ring that is wider than the neck of your bottle--about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide should be fine. Separate the key ring, and feed it onto the end of your chain. The key ring will act as a stopper inside the bottle. The key ring must be bigger than the neck of the bottle. If it is too small, it won't hold the bottle up. If you are using a cord, tie the bottom end to a large key ring using a secure double-knot. If you can't find a key ring, you could use plain, metal ring. Feed the other end of the chain through the neck of the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down, and place the chain inside. Let the chain fall through the neck of the bottle and out the top. The key ring will sit right inside the neck. Follow this same process if you are using a nylon cord. Thread another split key ring onto the top of the chain. This will allow you to actually hang the finished wind chime from a hook. Hold the wind chime up by the second key ring; the bottle will slide down the chain and stop at the first key ring. The first key ring will be either somewhere inside the neck or just below it. If you are using a nylon cord, simply tie the other end to another key ring or metal ring. Adding the Wind Catch Cut a second chain for the wind catch to dangle from. Hold the bottle up by the chain and note where the key ring sits inside. Measure from this point down to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom edge of the bottle. Cut a second piece of chain according to that length. The wind catch is the little ornament that dangles from the bottom of the wind chime. If you used a nylon cord previously, you should use a second piece here. Extend the cord below the bottom edge of the bottle. Add the second chain to the key ring inside the bottle. Reach into the bottle and pull out the key ring. Thread the end of your second chain onto this key ring, then hold your wind chime up again. You will have 2 chains in your bottle. The first chain should be sticking out of the top of the bottle. The second chain will be dangling inside the bottle. If you used a nylon cord, tie it to the ring.

Split open the key ring, and thread it onto the loop that's on top of your pendant. If you used a hook, simply slide it onto the bottom ring of the chain. Hang the wind chime using the key ring at the top of the chain. You can hang it outside where the wind will catch it, but if you want to use it for purely decorative purposes, hang it indoors instead.",
