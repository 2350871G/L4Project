          "description":"Small surface cracks and chips that don't go all the way through the granite can be unsightly, but they don't pose a threat to the longevity of your granite surface. In fact, small cracks that go with the grain of the granite, called fissures, are a normal aspect of the stone. If you can only see a hairline crack from a very specific angle and you can't feel it when you run your hand across the surface, then it is likely that the crack is completely harmless and can be left alone. To ensure that these small imperfections do not become more unsightly, be sure to seal your granite regularly, usually once a year."

          "description":"In order to make the repair blend in with the rest of the slab, you will need to color the glue to match it. This is done by using some of the granite to color the glue. To create granite dust, use a grinder with a diamond grinding bit to go over the surface of a matching piece of granite. The fine dust created is what you will use. You will need no more than 2 teaspoons of granite powder to repair most cracks under 1 foot (0.30 m) long. If you have an extra piece of the counter top material, you can use this. You can also remove a bit of granite dust from an area that is not visible, such as the underside of a counter top. Wear a dust mask that is rated for this type of particulate."
