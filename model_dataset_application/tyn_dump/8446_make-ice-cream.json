    "If you aren\u2019t going to eat your ice cream right away, transfer it to an airtight, freezer-safe container.",
    "Store it in the freezer until you serve it.",
    "It\u2019s a good idea to let the ice cream sit out for 5 to 10 minutes before you serve it so it\u2019s easier to scoop.",
    "Mixing Up No Churn Ice Cream Chill a freezer-safe pan.",
    "For the ice cream, you\u2019ll need a 9 by 5 in (23 by 13 cm) stainless steel loaf pan that's about 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep.",
    "Place the pan into the freezer, and allow it to chill for at least 1 hour.",
    "The reason you want to chill the pan is so that the ice cream freezes faster.",
    "If the ice cream doesn't freeze fast enough, it will develop ice crystals.",
    "Combine the condensed milk, vanilla, and salt.",
    "Add a 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of pure vanilla extract, and a pinch of fine salt to a medium bowl.",
    "Whisk the ingredients together until they\u2019re fully blended, then set the mixture aside.",
    "Don't use plain, unsweetened condensed milk, or the ice cream won't be sweet enough.",
    "Whip the cream until stiff peaks form.",
    "Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of cold heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer.",
    "Use medium-high speed to whip the cream until stiff peaks form, which should take about 5 minutes.",
    "For the best results, chill the stand mixer bowl in your refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "You can use an electric hand mixer or whip the cream by hand if you prefer.",
    "Fold half of the cream into the condensed milk mixture.",
    "After you\u2019ve whipped the cream, spoon about half of it into the bowl with the condensed milk mixture.",
    "Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the whipped cream into the mixture until it is just incorporated.",
    "Be careful not to overmix the mixture or you\u2019ll take some of the air out of the cream.",
    "Add the condensed milk mixture to the rest of the cream.",
    "Once you\u2019ve lightened the condensed milk mixture with some of the whipped cream, spoon it into the bowl with the rest of the whipped cream.",
    "Fold the two together until they\u2019re well blended.",
    "When folding the ingredients together, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.",
    "Be sure to fold the ingredients--not stir.",
    "This will help introduce more air into the ice cream, which will give you a lighter texture.",
    "Pour the mixture into the pan and cover.",
    "Use the rubber spatula to help transfer all of the ice cream mixture into the chilled pan.",
    "Cover it with a pieces of plastic wrap, making sure that it\u2019s airtight.",
    "Covering the pan is important.",
    "If you don't do this, the ice cream may develop ice crystals on top.",
    "It may also absorb not-so-tasty odors from your freezer.",
    "Freeze the mixture for a couple of hours, then add mix-ins.",
    "Place the pan in the freezer, and allow it to freeze until it reaches the consistency of soft-serve, which should take approximately 2 hours.",
    "If you\u2019d like to add any cookies, nuts, candy, or other mix-ins, stir them in until they\u2019re incorporated.",
    "Match the mix-ins to the flavor of the ice cream.",
    "For example, nuts would taste great in chocolate ice cream, but not so great in mint.",
    "Continue to freeze the ice cream until it\u2019s scoopable.",
    "Cover the pan once more, and return it to the freezer.",
    "Let the ice cream freeze for another 3 hours, or until it is solid and able to be scooped."
