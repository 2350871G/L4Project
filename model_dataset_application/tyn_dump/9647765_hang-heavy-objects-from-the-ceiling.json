Whenever possible, it\u2019s best to hang a heavy object from a load-bearing joist beam, that way the item has plenty of support. To locate a ceiling joist beam, run a stud finder along the ceiling until the machine beeps, indicating the presence of a stud. To make sure there is actually a joist underneath, rap the area with your knuckles. If it sounds hollow, look for another spot. Make marks on the joist where the object will hang. Make a pencil mark indicating the location of the stud. If you\u2019re only using 1 hanging attachment for your object, this mark is all you need. If you\u2019re using multiple hanging attachments, measure where they will connect to the object relative to the item\u2019s center.

Though some objects may not fit entirely on a joist, especially wide or strangely shaped ones, you should place as many of their hanging attachments on the joist as possible. Grab C-shaped hooks to hang objects close to the ceiling. C-shaped ceiling hooks are long, curved hooks with a screw mount on one end. They screw directly into the wood and, when properly installed, are incredibly secure. When purchasing a hook, look for the exact weight limit to make sure it can hold your object.

Hanging Objects from Hollow Drywall Figure out how many hanging attachments you can use. Without a joist to support the load, hanging heavy objects from the ceiling can be difficult. However, using multiple hanging attachments can help better distribute the weight. If you have a large object, place a hook or chain on each area of the item that you can, especially the corners and edges. If you have a small object, place multiple chains near the center of the item, that way you can spread the chains out to different anchors. Use a tape measure to calculate the distance between your item\u2019s center and hanging points. Record these numbers, as you\u2019ll use them to mark where on the ceiling each anchor needs to go. Because you\u2019ll be installing multiple ceiling anchors, measuring first is essential to make sure you place them correctly. Because the ceiling is flat, these measurements will not show how far down the object will hang, just where the highest hanging points will sit. When measuring chains, hold them up as if they were already hanging so your numbers reflect how the object will actually sit. Make marks on the ceiling where your anchors will sit. With a pencil, mark a spot on the ceiling where you want the center of your object to be. Then, using your previous measurements as a guide, create marks showing where each of the object\u2019s hanging points go relative to the center point. If possible, hold your item up to the marks to make sure they are accurate. Drill holes into each marked spot using a power drill. The holes should be large enough that your can press collapsed ceiling anchors through them. Depending on the specific anchor size, expect to use a .25 in (0.64 cm) drillbit or a drillbit that is \u204416 in (0.16 cm) bigger than the anchor\u2019s thread diameter. Insert ceiling anchors into the holes. To better distribute the object\u2019s weight, hang it on ceiling anchors (also known as toggle bolts) that come with hook attachments. To attach a toggle bolt, assemble it as instructed and make sure the wings are collapsed. Then, insert the non-flared end into the hole.
