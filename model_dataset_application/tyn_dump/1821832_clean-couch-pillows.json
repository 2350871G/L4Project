    "Most covers made out of cotton, linen, or polyester will be machine washable.",
    "Check the tag to make sure.",
    "If the cover is made out of wool, velvet, silk, or upholstery, it cannot be washed.",
    "You should take it to a dry-cleaner.",
    "Anything with intricate beading and trim should be dry-cleaned or spot-cleaned.",
    "A washing machine will be too rough on the details.",
    "Leather and suede pillow covers cannot be washed.",
    "They should be spot-cleaned only.",

    "2 parts 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1 part dishwashing soap.",
    "2 parts water, 1 part hydrogen peroxide, and 1 part washing soda.",
    "2 cups (475 milliliters) warm water, 2/3 cups(160 milliliters) dishwashing soap, 2/3 cups (160 milliliters) ammonia, and 6 tablespoons baking soda.",
    "Turn the pillow cover inside out.",

    "Consider doing a spot test for color fastness on fabrics.",
    "If the stain is in an obvious area, consider doing a spot test in an inconspicuous area first.",
    "You can do this simply by soaking a cotton ball with water, and lightly dabbing it on the pillow.",
    "If the color bleeds, take the pillow to a dry-cleaner.",
    "If the color does not bleed, you can spot clean it.",

    "She has worked in the cleaning industry for over 5 years.",
    "Ashley Matuska\t\t\tCleaning Guru\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: If you can't remove the covers on your couch cushions, spot clean them with a microfiber towel.",
    "You can also vacuum them to remove dust and dirt.",
    "Do not use water on covers made from suede.",
    "Brush the entire piece using a soft-bristled brush to loosen dirt.",
    "Always go with the grain stead of against.",
    "A suede brush would be ideal, but a clean toothbrush or manicure brush might also work.",
    "If the stain remains, follow up with any of the following options:\nTry white vinegar on stains.",
    "Dampen the brush with vinegar first, then go over the stain.",
    "Don't worry, the smell will go away.",
    "Use suede cleaner on tough stains.",
    "Consider doing a spot test first, in case of discoloration.",
    "Sprinkle cornstarch/cornflour over oily stains, wait overnight, then vacuum the next morning.",
    "Use a soft-bristled brush to comb out any residue cornflour/cornstarch.",
    "Use water with care.",
    "Some stains must be cleaned out with water.",
    "Dampen the brush first, then go over the stain--and the rest of the pillow.",
    "This will help conceal any potential discoloration.",
    "Clean microfiber with care.",
    "Read the care tag on your pillow and try to notice if there is a letter code on it.",
    "Choose one of the cleaning methods from the list below, based on the letter code.",
    "If the microfiber turns hard after you clean it, simply brush the fabric with a soft-bristled brush, such as a clean suede brush, toothbrush, or manicure brush.",
    "If the tag has a W on it, you can use a water-based cleaner, such as soapy water.",
    "If the tag has a S on it, you can use an alcohol-based cleaner, such as rubbing alcohol or vodka.",
    "If the tag has a S-W on it, you can use either water or alcohol based-cleaners.",
    "If the tag has a X on it, you must vacuum the fabric.",
    "If there is no tag, use an alcohol-based cleaner.",
    "Washing Feather and Fiberfill Pillows Remove the pillow insert from the cover from the pillow, if you can.",
    "If you cannot remove the pillow insert, make sure that the cover is washable.",
    "If it is not washable, you will need to spot clean the cover instead.",
    "Click here to learn how to clean a non-removable pillow cover.",
    "Make sure that there are no tears in the pillow, and repair any you find.",
    "The last thing you'd want is to put a damaged pillow into a washer, and open the door at the end of the cycle to find a pile of feathers.",
    "Before you stick your pillow into the washer, examine it carefully.",
    "Focus on the body of the pillow as well as the seams.",
    "If you see any rips or tears, stitch them up using a needle and thread.",
    "Place two pillows into the washer vertically, and do not include the rest of your laundry.",
    "Placing the pillows vertically will ensure that they won't wrap around the agitator while they are spinning and get tangled.",
    "Washing two pillows at once will help balance out the drum inside the washing machine.",
    "Washing the pillows separate from the rest of your laundry will ensure that there is enough water to rinse the soap out properly.",
    "If the pillow is not washable, toss it into dryer with a few tennis balls or dryer balls.",
    "The head will kill any odor-causing bacteria.",
    "Use cool to warm water, a mild soap, and a gentle cycle.",
    "When choosing soap, make sure that it is liquid and low sudsing; powdered detergent will be too difficult to wash out.",
    "If the care label on your pillow has different requirements for water temperature, detergent, and cycle setting, follow what the label says instead.",
    "Consider doing another rinse cycle.",
    "Because pillows are so bulky, a single rinse cycle may not be enough.",
    "Many people find that they have to do an additional rinse cycle or two in order to get all of the suds out.",
    "Remove the pillows promptly once the cycle ends.",
    "The longer they sit, the more likely they will end up smelling musty.",
    "Squeeze out any excess water by placing the pillow between two towels and rolling it up.",
    "Do not twist or wring the pillow.",
    "Instead, place it at the end of a large, clean towel.",
    "Place another towel right on top, so that the pillow is sandwiched in between.",
    "Start rolling the pillow along with the two towels, from one end to the other.",
    "Press down on the roll, then unravel it.",
    "Repeat this step for any other pillows you have just washed Dry the pillow in the dryer on a no-heat to low-heat setting.",
    "If the pillows are filled with feathers, use the no-heat setting.",
    "If the pillows are filled with a synthetic material, such as fiberfill, use a low-heat setting.",
    "Consider adding a few dryer balls or tennis balls into the dryer along with the pillows.",
    "This will help them dry faster as well as fluff them up.",
    "You can also lay pillows flat to dry.",
    "They will dry the fastest if they are laid out in the sun.",
    "If the care label on your pillow has different drying instructions, follow what the label says instead.",
    "Place the covers onto the pillows once everything is completely dry.",
    "Do not cover wet pillows, or they will start to get moldy and smell musty.",
    "Washing Foam Pillows Remove the pillow insert from the cover from the pillow, if you can.",
    "If you cannot remove the pillow insert, make sure that the cover is washable.",

    "2 parts 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1 part dishwashing soap.",
    "2 parts water, 1 part hydrogen peroxide, and 1 part washing soda.",
    "2 cups (475 milliliters) warm water, 2/3 cups(160 milliliters) dishwashing soap, 2/3 cups (160 milliliters) ammonia, and 6 tablespoons baking soda.",
    "Fill a bathtub with warm water and add a mild detergent.",
    "Make sure that there is enough water to completely submerge the pillow.",
    "Also, try to use a detergent intended for hand washing; they tend to be gentler.",
    "When adding the detergent, follow instructions on the bottle in regards to amount.",
    "If you cannot find a mild \"hand washing\" detergent, use a regular washing machine detergent.",
    "Decrease the amount you are using, and put on a pair of rubber gloves.",
    "You can also try using dish soap or baby shampoo.",
    "Agitate the water, then add the pillow.",
    "Depending on how large your pillows are, you may be able to fit more than one in your tub.",
    "If your pillows are very dirty to begin with, you might want to wash them one at a time.",
    "Press down on the pillow repeatedly.",
    "Not only will this force the pillow underwater, but the repeated pressing motion will force the water into it.",
    "The soapy water will help flush out any dirt and dust.",
    "If your pillow is very dirty, you may need to replace the water.",
    "Just remember to add more detergent to any water changes.",
    "Drain the water and press out the excess water from the pillow.",
    "Drain the water first.",
    "Once the water is all gone, press down on the pillow to squeeze out any excess water.",
    "Don't worry if the water coming out of the pillow is dirty\u2014just make sure that you get it all out.",
    "Refill the tub with fresh water and let the pillow soak for 10 minutes.",
    "If necessary, press down on the pillow so that it fills with water and sinks.",
    "You want it to be completely submerged\u2014and stayed submerged.",
    "If the pillow won't stay down, place a couple of heavy jars on top of it.",
    "Press down on the pillow several times, and replace the water as necessary when it becomes dirty.",
    "Keep doing this until the water runs clear.",
    "Alternatively, you can empty the tub of all water, and rinse the pillow under running water.",
    "A shower with a removable head would be ideal, but the water spout would work for smaller pillows.",
    "Press down on the pillow to expel any excess water.",
    "Once the water draining from the pillow is clear, it is time to start drying the pillow.",
    "Press down on the pillow in various spots to expel any excess water.",
    "Keep doing this until no more water comes out of the pillow.",
    "Let the pillow air-dry in the sun.",
    "Do not try to dry the pillow in the dryer; the heat may cause the pillow to melt.",
    "Instead, set the pillow down on a clean towel in the sun, and wait for it to become completely dry.",
    "If you were unable to remove the cover and are concerned about the fabric fading, set the pillow down in a shaded, but well-ventilated, area.",
    "Test the pillow for any remaining moisture before putting the covers on.",
    "Once you think the pillow is dry, take a paper towel and press down hard on the pillow.",
    "Make sure that you are pressing down hard enough to compress the pillow.",
    "Lift the paper towel away, and inspect it.",
    "If it feels wet, the pillow needs to dry more.",
    "If it feels dry, the pillow is ready to be covered and put back on the couch.",
    "Consider vacuuming dusty pillows.",
    "If your pillow is only dusty, and not heavily stained, you might just have to vacuum it using the upholstery attachment.",
    "Try to use a lower suction setting so that you do not damage the foam.",
    "Consider using baking soda to absorb foul odors.",
    "If you've washed your pillow and it still smells, sprinkle baking soda liberally over it, and leave it outside in the sun.",
    "After a few hours, bring the pillow back inside and vacuum the baking soda up.",
    "The baking soda will have absorbed any foul odors.",
    "Be sure to use the upholstery attachment and a lower suction setting on your vacuum cleaner so as not to damage the foam."
