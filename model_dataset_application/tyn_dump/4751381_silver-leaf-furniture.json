Gather some excess pieces of silver leaf and brush them into places where there are holes in the silver leaf. Continue burnishing until the excess leaf is removed. However, you will still be able to see the seams until you seal it. You can also apply Rub N Buff silver color to these areas before you seal it to get rid of bare spots.
