      "description":"It helps to wash the knobs before sanding and painting them; this keeps small particles of dust and debris from mixing in with the paint and marring the finish. You can wash the knobs with water and any mild soap. Wipe the knobs completely dry with a clean cloth before sanding them."

    {
      "headline":"Sand the knobs.",
      "description":"Once the knobs are dry, go over each of them lightly with medium-grit sandpaper. This will prepare the surface for priming, and will also help to remove any loose or flaked paint from the knob. Wipe the knobs with a tack cloth after sanding to remove any particles of paint or metal left by the sanding."

    {
      "headline":"Prepare the knobs for priming and painting.",
      "description":"You will not be able to handle the knobs while applying the primer or paint, because this will create fingerprints in the finish. The simplest way to set the knobs up for painting is to lay them out on a sheet of plastic with their tops facing up. However, a more elegant solution can be prepared using a sheet of cardboard. Obtain a large sheet of sturdy corrugated cardboard; you can easily cut one out from a shipping box. Fold the sheet down the middle so that it holds a 45 degree angle. Place the folded cardboard on top of a flat surface so that it forms a \"tent\" shape. Poke the screw of each knob through the underside of the cardboard and secure the knobs just as you would when installing them in your drawers. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a2\\/Paint-Metal-Knobs-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Paint-Metal-Knobs-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a2\\/Paint-Metal-Knobs-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Paint-Metal-Knobs-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nYou can now prime and paint the knobs in place on the cardboard support.

To apply it, shake the can as indicated in the directions, and spray the entire cardboard support in long, smooth passes. A thin layer is all that is needed, and will dry faster than a thick layer.
