Cutting with the grain means will result in tough, stringy steak, while cutting against it will make the steak more tender.

If you notice that the papery skin layers are starting to come off with one of the ends, grab these outer layers and peel them away. If they do not come off as easily, you may need to slide your fingernail beneath these outer layers to loosen them and peel them away. Cut the onion in half from top to bottom, then in half again in the same direction. Make a few slices, starting in the center of each wedge. Do this for each quarter until layered slices are left behind. These layers should break apart naturally when the slices are moved."

Cut into each indentation in the pepper without detaching the slices from the center of the vegetable. Note where the indented sections of the pepper begin on the inside top, near the stem. Begin each slice at this starting point, but do not slice through into the bottom of the stem. Cut straight down from top to bottom, freeing the bottom of each slice but not the top. When all slices are made, use your fingers to gently break them off from the center of the pepper. The seeded part of the pepper, located just below the stem, should not break free. As a result, you should have very few seeds to clean up. Discard this portion and turn your attention back to your strips. Cut each strip into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.
