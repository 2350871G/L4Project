Choose one of the 16 foot (4.9 m) ends to be the \"front\" of your greenhouse, where the door will be located. With the help of a friend, bend a 20 foot (6.1 m) length of PVC pipe into an arch, and slide the ends over the \"front\" pair of rebar stakes.

Repeat the previous step with the third 40 foot (12.2 m) piece of PVC along the opposite edge of the plastic sheet, roll it up, and duct tape it securely.  Lay the assembly against one of the long sides of your skeleton, and with the help of a friend or two, walk one side of the plastic sheet with PVC attached over the top of the arches to form the \"skin\" of your greenhouse.  Once you have the skin stretched over the skeleton, make sure it's centered, so there's an equal amount of excess material lying on each side of the greenhouse.  Pile sand, sod, or loose soil over the flap of excess material (and the attached PVC pipe) along the whole length of one side of the greenhouse. Tuck the plastic sheet into the corner where the ribs of the greenhouse meet the ground, and be careful not to allow wrinkles to form in the sheet between the ribs. Once one side of the sheet is thoroughly weighted down, go to the other side of the greenhouse, pull the plastic sheet down tight, and bury the excess material there the same way, making sure to keep the sheet as snug and wrinkle-free as possible.  Plant a pressure-treated 4x4 vertically about 2 feet (0.6 m) to either side of the spine of the greenhouse at each end to form uprights. The tops of the 4x4's should extend slightly above the point where they cross the front and back ribs of the greenhouse, so dig the holes accordingly.
