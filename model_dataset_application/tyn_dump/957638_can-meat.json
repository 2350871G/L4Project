Since meat is a low acid food, and does not contain natural preservatives, using a pressure canner is the only safe way to can it. Pressure canners are available new at kitchen supply stores, but you may be able to borrow one or find a used one online. Consider getting a jar lifter to use with the canner. This tool is used for moving the jars out of the steaming water when the canning process is complete. Do not use a simple bath canner to can meat. Bath canners do not raise the internal temperature of the meat to a high enough level to kill the contaminants."

Lay out your cutting board and knife, paper towels and some vinegar for wiping the rims of the jars. Place your jars within reach of the cutting board so you'll be able to transfer the meat to them right away. Keep the lids and rings away from the meat area to prevent them from getting bits of fat or grease on them."

They have safety features in place to prevent them from exploding with pressure buildup. That said, it's important to handle the machine with care. Take the following precautions before you start canning:\nKeep children and pets away from the kitchen. The machine gets very hot, and a small child could pull it down from the counter. Kids and pets underfoot could cause you to trip and break a glass jar. It's best to keep them out of the kitchen while you're concentrating on canning. Check the vents in your pressure canner. Each time you use it, check to make sure the vents aren't clogged. If they are, dangerous pressure could build up in the machine. Make sure the pressure gauge is accurate. If it's not, too much pressure could build up without you realizing there's a problem. Be ready to stay close by at all times. Don't leave the kitchen while you're using the pressure canner."

As you cut the meat, remove any pieces of bone or gristle. If you're canning ground meat, you can skip the cubing step. Form the meat into patties or can it loose.
