          "description":"Ignoring the claims of late-night sales pitches, many granite counter tops are better left unsealed. To test your surface, leave a few drops of water or a wet paper towel on the granite for 10 to 15 minutes. If the water begins to soak into and darken the counter top, continue to the next step to begin sealing. If the water remains beaded on the surface, the counter top is already stain-resistant, and should not be sealed. If the granite will be exposed to petroleum-based products, repeat the test with a few drops of mineral oil. Seal if either test darkens the granite. If the water doesn't soak in, don't seal it anyway \"just in case.\" The sealer needs to soak into the stone to be effective, and if it can't, you'll end up with an ugly, hazy residue."

          "description":"Apply a few drops of lemon juice onto the granite. Take a look at the granite underneath the drops. If dark spots are developing within the first minute, set down the sealer! Your stone is very absorbent and probably shouldn\u2019t be sealed, or in use at all. Call an expert to get a professional opinion and discuss your options. If it takes 4-5 minutes or more for the granite to darken under the lemon drops, go ahead and seal the granite. If the stone never darkens or takes half an hour or more, there\u2019s no need to seal--your granite is stain-proof!"

          "description":"Only use products specifically designed for natural stone, and ideally for granite specifically. A penetrating or \"impregnating\" sealer will soak into the counter top to slow stain absorption, without causing the structural or aesthetic issues caused by top sealers in this application. These guidelines are enough to prevent harm to your counter top, but you can dive into the fine print if you're interested:\nFor best results, choose a carbon resin sealer. Look for one that mentions \"fluorocarbon aliphatic resin\" on the label. These can provide years of good protection, but are also the most expensive. The next best options use \"siloxane\" or \"silane,\" which tend to be a little worse at repelling oil. Avoid silicone-based sealers or linseed-based sealers. They are the least durable and will need to be resealed every eight months or so, and can sometimes even cause color deterioration. Some sealant chemicals can be either water-based or solvent-based. Experts disagree on which is best; both are adequate, but water-based sealer is easier to apply and better for the environment."

Sealing the Granite Countertop Clean the granite. Wipe off the granite with water and dish soap or a specialized stone cleaner like Tenax, then wipe with a dry towel or cloth, preferably lint-free. Use a degreasing product, then do a final clean with denatured alcohol. Wait 24 hours to allow the granite to dry completely and return to its original color before continuing, or 8 hours if a strong breeze is blowing across it.

Solvent-based sealers may produce unpleasant or harmful vapors during application, so open a window and put on a pair of gloves. Don't worry; the sealer will not leave any harmful chemicals in your kitchen. Test in a small corner. Choose an, unobtrusive corner of the granite, perhaps where a microwave or other appliance is normally located. Follow the steps below on a tiny area first, to make sure the sealer is compatible with the granite. If the sealer leaves a hazy residue or discolors the granite, find a different product. While the advice in the preparation section should prevent most of these problems, the extreme variety found among granite surfaces makes it impossible to reduce the chance to zero.
