This is usually 1/5-1/4 of a cap if you\u2019re measuring the detergent out by eye.Warning: Never use bleach, specialty cleaners, or brightening agents. Combat uniforms are usually treated with permethrin, which kills lice, mites, and other pests you may encounter when you\u2019re on duty. Any cleaning agent outside of standard laundry detergent can compromise the permethrin that\u2019s built into the fabric."

Turn your washing machine on and let it run until the cycle is finished. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, hand-washing a combat uniform isn\u2019t really an option.

To protect the permethrin, your uniform must not get hotter than 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C), so avoid using a regular or high-heat dryer setting. Never dry clean a combat uniform.

Every military handbook requires unwrinkled and neat uniforms, and air drying ensures that wrinkles won\u2019t form on the fabric. Use a plastic or wood hanger to hang your shirt, and hang the pants on the bottom bar of a separate hanger. Wait 2-4 hours for your uniform to dry. Never use cornstarch or an iron. The compounds in cornstarch and the heat from an iron will destroy the permethrin in your uniform. If your uniform is wrinkled and you\u2019re in a pinch, hang it in the bathroom and turn the shower on and turn the handle to make the water as hot as possible. The steam will remove the wrinkles after 15-30 minutes."
