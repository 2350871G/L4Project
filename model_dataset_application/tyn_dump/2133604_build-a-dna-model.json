Plus, they\u2019ll make your model more vibrant and interesting to look at! If you can\u2019t find a pack of pipe cleaners with 6 colors in it, that\u2019s okay.

The colors you choose for the strands don\u2019t matter, but try to use 6 different colors if you can. For example, you could choose blue and pink pipe cleaners for the outer strands and green, yellow, purple, and red pipe cleaners for the inner strands. The 2 colors for the outer strands will represent sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate, while the 4 colors for the inner strands will be the cytosine, thymine, guanine, and adenine."

Then, use your hands to twist them together, starting at one end and working your way down to the opposite end. When you\u2019re finished, you should have one long, twisted strand made up of 2 different color pipe cleaners."

Then, use a pair of scissors to cut through the creases along each of the pipe cleaners so that each one is divided up into 5 equal parts. Since you\u2019ll be using 4 pipe cleaners and cutting each one into 5 equal pieces, you should end up with 20 pieces in total."

          "headline":"Pair 10 inner strand pieces with each outer strand.",
          "description":"It doesn\u2019t matter which inner strand pieces you pair with each outer strand, but try to only use 2 inner-strand colors per outer strand. Make sure all the nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) are represented on each outer strand. In order to do this, assign a particular color to each base. For example, you could use red for adenine, blue for thymine, green for cytosine, and yellow for guanine. After you\u2019ve assigned the colors, you can accurately pair the complementary bases. Adenine always pairs with thymine, while guanine pairs with cytosine. So, if you have a red (adenine) pipe cleaner on one side, put a blue (thymine) pipe cleaner in the same spot on the other side, and so on. Once you\u2019ve paired up the inner and outer strands, keep them separated so you don\u2019t get all of the pipe cleaners mixed up."

Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of each inner strand extending off of the outer strand it\u2019s attached to. You want the ends of the inner strands that are extending off of the outer strands to all be going in the same direction."

To tape the inner strands together, simply line up the ends so they\u2019re overlapping slightly and then wrap a piece of clear tape around them. Do this for each set of inner strands along your model. If you don\u2019t have clear tape, that\u2019s OK. You can use different tape instead. It may just be a little visible once your model is finished."

Once your model has a spiral shape, press your hands together to squish the model flat, which will help the pipe cleaners remain twisted in a helix. Once your DNA model retains its shape, you\u2019re finished! If your model starts to lose its shape after a while, just twist and compress it with your hands again."

    "However, to give your DNA model the proper helix shape, you\u2019ll want to angle the toothpicks slightly and insert them so they\u2019re pointing in opposite directions.",
    "The angle of the toothpicks doesn\u2019t need to be precise.",
    "As long as they\u2019re sticking up at an angle and they\u2019re angled in opposite directions, your model will work.",
    "Stick a green ball onto the toothpicks sticking out of each white ball.",
    "Push the green balls down all the way so they\u2019re touching the white balls.",
    "These green and white balls will make up the outer strands of your model, and they\u2019ll help support the next rung.",
    "The green balls represent phosphate, while the white ones represent sugar (deoxyribose).",
    "Since you angled the toothpicks in the white balls, the green balls should be sitting on top of the white balls at an angle as well.",
    "Create the next rung using blue and orange balls this time.",
    "The colors should alternate in each rung in your model.",
    "Since you used red and yellow balls to make the first rung, you\u2019ll want to use blue and orange balls to make the next one.",
    "Just like with the first rung, start by connecting a blue and orange ball with a toothpick.",
    "Then, attach a white ball to each end of the rung.",
    "In order to accurately represent the complementary base pairs, make sure to always pair red with yellow and blue with orange between the 2 strands.",
    "You should also insert a toothpick into each white ball so they\u2019re angled in opposite directions like you did with the first rung.",
    "Use toothpicks to attach the second rung to the green balls.",
    "Insert a toothpick into each green ball so it\u2019s angled in the same direction as the toothpick in the white ball below it.",
    "Then, stick the white balls at the end of the second rung onto these toothpicks.",
    "At this point you\u2019ll be able to see the beginning of your DNA model\u2019s helix shape.",
    "Continue to attach new rungs until you\u2019ve used all of the Styrofoam balls.",
    "Remember to alternate the colors you\u2019re using when you\u2019re building the rungs.",
    "Also, don\u2019t forget to attach green balls in between each rung in the model.",
    "Once you\u2019ve used all of the balls, your DNA model is finished!",
    "If you want your model to stand up on its own, attach the rung at the bottom to a Styrofoam block using toothpicks."
