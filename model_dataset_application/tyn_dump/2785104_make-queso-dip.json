  "text":" Cooking in the Microwave Make a cheddar cheese queso dip in the microwave. This low-hassle recipe makes about five cups of queso dip. Cut the cheddar cheese into one inch cubes. Cubing the cheese allows it to melt faster. If you do not cut it into small chunks before heating, portions may melt too quickly and burn, while the center remains solid. If you do not want to cube your cheese, try buying shredded cheese, or shred it yourself. Mix all three ingredients together. Combine the prepared cheese, diced tomatoes, green chiles, an chili beans in a microwavable glass bowl. Be sure the ingredients are mixed together evenly. Microwave for five minutes on a high setting. Pause the microwave after three minutes, and stir the dip. Stirring the dip disperses the heat, promoting more even melting. The dip is finished once all the processed cheese has melted. Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor. Serve hot. Stir the dip once more after pulling it out of the microwave. This will ensure that all of the cheese is melted, and the ingredients are well mixed. Queso dip can be served with tortilla chips, wheat crackers, or fresh vegetables. Cooking on a Stove-Top Try this stove-top recipe for a traditional Velveeta queso dip. This recipe makes about six cups. Whisk together the milk and corn starch. Combine the two ingredients in a medium saucepan, and whisk until the mixture is smooth.

The sour cream can be added all at once, but the cheese should be added one handful at a time, stirring well after each addition. To prevent the cheese from burning, allow each handful of cheese to melt before adding more in. Stop adding cheese once the dip reaches your desired thickness. Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor. Heat for an additional minute.

You can serve the hot queso dip right out of the saucepan, or pour it into a serving dish. Serve the queso dip with chips or vegetables. Cooking in a Slow Cooker Utilize your slow cooker for a rich chili-queso. This is a great way to make queso and keep it warm for several hours at a time because you can serve it right from the slow cooker. This recipe makes about six cups.
