Add half of 2 \u00bd pounds (1.1 kg) of boneless beef chuck that\u2019s been trimmed and cut into \u00be-inch (19-mm) cubes, and lightly brown the meat on at least two sides, which should take about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked meat to a bowl, and repeat the process with another 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil and the rest of the meat. Transfer the cooked meat to a bowl. Make sure to swirl the oil throughout the skillet so it is fully greased. Be careful not the burn the meat. If you suspect that it might be cooking too quickly, lower the heat. Saute the onion and garlic. Allow the skillet to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before returning it to the stove on medium low heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oil, \u2153 cup (50 g) of finely chopped onion, and 3 large, minced cloves of garlic to the skillet, and saute the onion and garlic for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir the onion and garlic periodically as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly. Stir in in the stock, water, and masa harina. Once the onion and garlic have sauteed for several minutes, add 2 cups (473 ml) of beef stock, 2 cups (473 ml) of water, and 2 tablespoons (14 g) of masa harina to the skillet. Whisk the ingredients together to ensure that there are no lumps. Masa harina is a finely ground corn flour. You can usually find it in the Mexican or international foods aisle at the grocery store. Mix in the chile paste and cooked beef and simmer. After you\u2019ve mixed in the stock, water, and masa harina, add the chile paste that you made earlier and the cooked beef to the skillet. Raise the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a simmer. If there are any juices in the bowl with the cooked beef, add them to the skillet as well. As you stir the chile paste and meat into the skillet, make sure to scrape the bottom to lift any browned bits and mix them in as well. Reduce heat and cook the mixture for 2 hours. When the mixture begins to simmer, turn the heat down to low. Allow the mixture to cook for about two hours or until the meat is tender but still slightly firm. Keep the lid off to allow some of the liquid to evaporate. This will help the chili thicken. Stir the mixture periodically as it simmers to ensure that it cooks evenly. Add the brown sugar, vinegar, and salt to taste and simmer again with the lid off. After the mixture has simmered for a couple of hours, mix 1 tablespoon (13 g) of firmly packed dark brown sugar, 1 \u00bd tablespoons (22 \u00bd ml) of distilled white vinegar, and more salt to taste into the skillet. Allow the mixture to simmer for another 10 minutes. It\u2019s normal for the chili to appear to have too much sauce even after simmering. The next step will help absorb some of it. Remove the chili from heat and allow it to stand. When the chili has finished simmering, turn off the heat. Let it stand for about 30 minutes, or until the meat absorbs approximately half of the sauce in the pan. Adjust the consistency and seasonings of the chili if necessary. After the chili has had a chance to stand for a half hour, stir it to determine if the consistency is right. Taste it as well to see if you want to add more of any of the seasonings. If the chili seems too dry, mix in more broth and/or water. If the chili seems too liquidy, turn the heat back on and allow it to simmer until it thickens further. Mix in additional salt, brown sugar, and/or vinegar to suit your taste. Reheat the chili and ladle it into bowls to serve. Turn the heat back on under the skillet to low or medium-low and reheat the chili gently. When it\u2019s warmed through, transfer it into individual bowls and serve the chili with a lime wedge and spoonful of sour cream. Store any uneaten chili in the refrigerator. It should keep for 3 to 4 days in an airtight container. You can freeze the chili if you don\u2019t eat all of it. Place it in freezer-safe containers, such as plastic freezer bags, in individual serving sizes after it\u2019s cooled completely. It will usually keep for 4 to 6 months in the freezer. Putting Together White Chili Saute the onions until they are tender. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil into a large heavy-bottomed pot, and heat it on medium-high heat. Add 1 medium chopped onion, and cook it until it is tender, which should take approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Stir the veggies frequently to prevent them from sticking. You can substitute canola oil for the olive oil if you prefer. Mix in the garlic, cumin, cloves, and cayenne. After you\u2019ve sauteed the onion, add 1 minced clove of garlic, \u00bc teaspoon (\u00bd g) of cayenne pepper, \u215b teaspoon (\u00bc g) of ground cloves, and 2 teaspoons (6 g) ground cumin to the pot. Let the mixture cook for another minute. You can add more cayenne pepper if you would like the chili to have more of a spicy kick. Stir in the green chilies, dried oregano, and jalapeno. When you\u2019ve cooked the onion mixture for another minute, add two 4-ounce (113 g) cans of chopped green chilies, 1 \u00bd teaspoons (3 g) of dried oregano, and 1 finely chopped jalapeno pepper to the pot. Mix well so the ingredients are fully incorporated. You can substitute a serrano pepper for the jalapeno if you prefer. Add the chicken and chicken stock and bring to a simmer. After you\u2019ve mixed in the chiles and oregano, stir 3 cups (375 g) of diced, cooked chicken and 3 cups (709 ml) of chicken stock into the pot. Raise the heat to high, and allow the mixture to come to a simmer. If you don\u2019t want to cook your own chicken, you can use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. Remove it from the bone and dice or shred it before mixing it in. Lower the heat and simmer for another 5 minutes. Once the mixture comes to a simmer, reduce the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. Allow the chili to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes or until the chicken is warmed through. Mix in the beans and cook for another 15 minutes. When the chili has simmered with the chicken mixed in, add two 15.5-ounce (439 g) cans of white beans that have been drained. Allow the mixture to cook for another 15 minutes. You can leave the lid off the pot when you simmer the chili for the final time. Season the chili to taste and top with the cheese to serve. After you\u2019ve simmered the beans with the chili, taste it. Add in more salt and pepper if necessary before ladling the chili into bowls. Top the bowls with some shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and serve. You can also top the chili with chopped tomato, chopped scallions, cilantro, guacamole, and/or tortilla chips. Store any uneaten chili in the refrigerator. It should keep for 3 to 4 days in an airtight container. You can freeze the chili if you don\u2019t eat all of it. Place it in freezer-safe containers, such as plastic freezer bags, in individual serving sizes after it\u2019s cooled completely. It will usually keep for 4 to 6 months in the freezer.",
