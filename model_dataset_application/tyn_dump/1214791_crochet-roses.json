For example, think about if you'd like to attach roses to a scarf, jacket, blanket, or hat. You'll need to decide how large you'd like your roses and how many you intend to make. Select your yarn. A worsted weight yarn is ideal for starting, since you'll be able to see the stitches. Consider how you'll be using the roses. If they're embellishing a scarf or purse, you may want a specialty yarn. Make sure the texture of the yarn matches the texture of the item you'll be attaching it to. Pick your crochet hook. This is basically determined by the type of yarn you've chosen.

The hook size suggestion doesn't have to be followed, but your crocheting might turn out knotty or too loose. Crocheting Your Roses Create a slipknot.

Double crochet all across your foundation chain. Make sure to insert your hook into the chain and not the gap closer to your hook. To double crochet into your chain, insert your hook and yarn over. Pull up a loop, yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Continue doing this across the length of the chain. Count your stitches. Check to make sure you have 60 stitches once you complete the row. Turn your work. Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row.
