The ideal piece should come up to your chin, though you may want a longer or shorter walking stick depending on your preference. It should be relatively straight, and relatively uniform in thickness, at least an inch or two in diameter. Green wood is too bendable to be effective as a walking or survival stick, so only collect dead wood to make for possible staffs.

After cleaning up your branch, let it sit for a few days to make sure it's thoroughly dried out. If an orangish skin starts to form on the inner flesh of the wood, that's water escaping.

Follow the instruction on the particular brand you purchase. Alternatively, some choose to woodburn, or do pyrography designs on their walking staff before sealing it.

You might also include carabiners for other attachments, like water bottles, knives, and other survival gear. Consider fashioning a leather grip and binding it to the staff to make the hand-grip more comfortable.
