Note that the oven is not strictly necessary since it will not be used to cook the chicken or the waffles.

If you want to eat the chicken and waffles separately, then you do not need to flatten the chicken. If you want to eat the dish sandwich style, however, flattening the pieces out first is strongly recommended. To flatten the chicken, begin by slicing each thawed chicken breast in half horizontally, roughly two-thirds of the way through the piece. Open the piece up and spread it out as flat as possible in between a top and bottom layer of wax paper. Starting at the center, pound the chicken with a meat mallet or rolling pin until it is roughly 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick. Remove the chicken from the wax paper when done.

As with the chicken, you will use the oven to keep earlier batches of waffles warm while you cook later batches. Mix the dry ingredients.

In a separate small bowl or measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, egg, and vegetable oil. Beat by hand with a whisk or fork until the ingredients are well combined. Beat together both mixtures. Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture. Use a fork or whisk to beat the mixtures together, stopping shortly after all the dry ingredients have been moistened.

Remove the waffles with a heat-resistant spatula or similar utensil. Avoid forks and other sharp utensils, however, since the pointed metal can scratch the nonstick surface of the iron. Keep warm. Transfer the cooked waffles to your prepared baking sheet and place them in the oven. Keep the early batches warm as you finish preparing the rest of the waffles. Part Three: Make the Optional Dijon Cream Sauce Whisk together the cream and thyme. Combine the two ingredients in a medium stainless steel saucepan. Mix gently with a whisk to spread the thyme throughout the cream. Fresh thyme works much better for this recipe than dried thyme, but if you want to use dried thyme, cut the amount used to a third. In other words, only use 1 tsp (5 ml) dried thyme. Cook until reduced by half. Place the saucepan on the stove and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes or until the liquid is reduced to half its original amount. Stirring the mixture prevents the cream from curdling. Do not allow the cream to boil too rapidly since it is more likely to burn or curdle at a high temperature. Whisk in the remaining ingredients. Remove the saucepan from the stove and add both Dijon mustards and the salt. Whisk well until the mustards melt down and the entire sauce is even in color and consistency. Keep warm. The sauce can be kept on the eye of the stove with the heat turned off until you are ready to use it. Serve the sauce while still warm. To save time, you can make the sauce a day or two in advance. Transfer the finished sauce to an airtight plastic container. Cover it, then refrigerate the sauce for up to three days. Reheat chilled sauce over medium-low heat on the stove, stirring constantly, when ready to serve. Part Four: Serve Pick your serving style. You can eat the chicken and waffles by arranging them side-by-side on the same serving plate or by stacking them together sandwich style. To serve the dish sandwich style, place one more more flattened pieces of fried chicken in between two waffles. Add your desired condiments. Drizzle the dish with warm Dijon cream sauce. For a more traditional taste, skip the cream sauce and serve the chicken and waffles with butter, maple syrup, and hot sauce, instead. If preparing the dish sandwich style, place these condiments on the chicken in between to the two layers of waffle rather than on the outer sides of the waffles. Enjoy.
