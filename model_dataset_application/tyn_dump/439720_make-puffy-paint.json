Be sure to use a shaving foam, not shaving gel. If you\u2019re concerned about the paint sticking to your spoons, you can use chopsticks, popsicle sticks, or even straws to mix the glue and shaving cream together."

Add a little of the glue and shaving cream mixture to each cup. It can be difficult to wash the paint out of containers, so it\u2019s best to use disposable plastic cups that you can toss away when you\u2019re done with the paint."

The amount that you\u2019ll need depends on how much of the paint mixture is in each cup and how dark you want the shade to be. Stir the coloring into the paint mixture until it\u2019s completely blended. The more food coloring that you add, the darker the paint will be. However, it\u2019s best to start with a small amount, such as 5 to 10 drops, and see if you\u2019re happy with the color before adding more. When you\u2019re adding the food coloring, keep in mind that the paint will dry darker that it appears when it\u2019s wet."

Be sure to use a good amount of the paint to ensure that it has a puffy texture. Some designs that you may want to create with your puffy paints include a rainbow and fluffy white clouds, a bouquet of flowers, a moon, and stars, or a bunch of balloons. The puffy paints are also ideal for holiday designs. For example, create a Christmas tree or menorah, hearts for Valentine's Day, or a jack o'lantern for Halloween. Allow the paint to dry completely before hanging or displaying the painting. It usually takes 4 to 6 hours."
