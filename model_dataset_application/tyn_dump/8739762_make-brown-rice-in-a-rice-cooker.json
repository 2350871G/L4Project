For example, two people sharing a cozy meal may only eat two to three cups of rice, whereas a larger meal may require six to eight. Working with even quantities will make it much easier to figure out exactly how much water you need to produce perfectly cooked rice. Using a dry measuring cup to scoop your rice will help you avoid any troublesome guesswork. For best results, only prepare as much rice as you plan on eating.

You may notice that the water draining out of the rice has a slightly milky appearance. This is normal. Shake out as much excess water as you can before cooking the rice."

          "description":"A good rule of thumb when making brown rice is to increase the recommended amount of water by 50%. Therefore, whereas you would normally use one cup of water for every cup of rice, you\u2019ll want to use one-and-a-half cups to account for the difference in texture. Since brown rice is tougher than white rice, it needs to cook longer. Unlike white rice, brown rice grains still have a natural fibrous bran layer. As a result, they don\u2019t absorb water as easily and take longer to cook to the ideal temperature. The amount of water you add to the rice is directly correlated to the overall cook time. When all the water has evaporated, the internal temperature of the rice cooker will rise, signalling it to shut off. Though not a necessity, soaking the brown rice for 20-30 minutes before cooking can also help it get more done. Should you decide to soak your rice, only use one cup of water for every cup of rice."

Most rice cookers only have a couple of settings: \u201ccook\u201d and \u201cwarm.\u201d\nIf the model you\u2019re using is more sophisticated, be sure to program it to the appropriate setting before cooking the rice.

Holding off on uncovering the rice for a few more minutes will allow it to absorb any remaining steam and begin cooling off to an edible temperature. Leave the lid on the cooker as the rice sits. Undercooked brown rice will often be crunchy and unappetizing. Don\u2019t skip this step. It can be tempting to dig in right away when you\u2019re hungry, but the full flavor and enhanced texture of the rice definitely make it worth the wait."

You\u2019ll now have a batch of perfectly cooked, velvety brown rice ready to be paired with a vegetable medley, savory stir fry or piece of seared fish. Never use metal utensils to fluff or scoop your rice. This may leave permanent scratches on the inside of the rice cooker. A shamoji can come in handy for those who make rice on a regular basis.
