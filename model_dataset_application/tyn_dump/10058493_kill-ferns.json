Pour boiling water over a plant's root system and leaves to kill it within several days without leaving a poisonous residue in the soil. You should need 1\u20132 gallons (3.8\u20137.6 L) of water to kill the fern, depending on its size. While you'll only need to pour the water once for most plants, you may need to repeat the process for larger or stubborn ferns.

If you want to kill the plant's root system within several days, saltwater is a natural, highly effective option. If you want to create salt water, mix the solution in a ratio of 1 part salt for every 8 parts water. Depending on the plant's size, mix 1\u20132 gallons (3.8\u20137.6 L) of the saltwater solution.

Industrial strength vinegar can irritate the skin, eyes, and lungs, so wear appropriate safety equipment while handling or use white vinegar as a safer alternative. Spray \u20442\u20131 gallon (1.9\u20133.8 L) of vinegar on the fern to effectively kill its root system.
