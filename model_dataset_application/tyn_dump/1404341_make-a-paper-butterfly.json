  "text":" Folding an Origami Butterfly Fold the paper in half, then open it and fold it in half the other way. Make sure to crease both of the folds. Line up the edges when you\u2019re folding to ensure the crease is directly in the center. If your paper is the same color or pattern on both sides, it doesn\u2019t matter which side you start on. However, if one side is white, or the \u201cbackside,\u201d begin with that side facing up. Choosing the Perfect Paper for Your Butterfly\nIf you're a beginner, choose oversized origami paper. Bigger sheets are easier to work with. For easy folding, use origami paper, because it is thinner than regular paper. If you want to add visual interest, opt for textured paper like linen or felt cardstock. For a dramatic accent, pick foil paper in a shimmery metallic. Fold the paper in half diagonally, open it, and fold on the other diagonal. Bring 2 opposite corners together to create the folds. Press down firmly to create defined creases. Repeat on both diagonals. Open the paper to lie flat after you fold it. Your 4 folds should intersect in the exact center of the paper. Bring the right and left creases together, creating a triangle. With the paper laying flat in front of you, press the right horizontal crease to the left one. As you do this, the paper should collapse onto itself in a triangle shape along the diagonal creases you made. Press down on the triangle to crease the paper once it\u2019s collapsed. If the paper isn\u2019t folding properly, go back over your original creases again. If they aren\u2019t defined enough, the paper will have trouble falling into the shape. Fold the 2 top corners into the center. When you created the triangle shape, it made 2 layers. Grab the corners on the top layer and line up their edges with the crease in the middle of the triangle. Try to align the corners with the crease perfectly so they aren\u2019t overlapping or so there isn\u2019t a large gap between the edges in the center. Flip the triangle over and fold the bottom up, leaving a small tip showing. You aren\u2019t folding it completely half. Instead you\u2019re folding it about 1/3 up from the base of the triangle. Hold the fold in place gently with your hand. Don\u2019t crease the fold. Bend the top layer of the tip over the base. There are 2 layers at the tip of the triangle. Peel the top 1 forward, folding it over the wide triangle bottom you\u2019re currently holding in place. The tip will be the head of the butterfly. Crease the fold that you make with the tip. This will help secure the body of the butterfly in place and prevent it from unraveling. Pull down the pieces from the bottom layer to create the lower wings. With the top layer folded over, bring the bottom layer of the tip in the opposite direction. The points of the 2 triangular pieces should be facing down, away from the folded head. It may help to hold the folded tip with your thumb while you pull the other pieces down so that the butterfly doesn\u2019t come apart. Re-crease the folded tip after you arrange the bottom pieces if necessary. Trim the edges of the wings if you want a smaller butterfly. Making a Pleated Paper Butterfly Fold the square piece of paper in half, creasing it. Line up the edges of the paper when you fold it to make sure you\u2019re creating a line directly down the middle. Press firmly with your fingernail to form the crease. Use any type of paper you\u2019d like, whether it\u2019s origami paper, colorful cardstock, or even pretty gift wrap. The size of your paper doesn\u2019t matter, as long as it\u2019s square.

If you have trouble cutting in a line, hold your scissors against a straight edge, like a ruler, while you cut. Make accordion folds with one of the pieces of the paper. Fold a small piece lengthwise, then flip the paper over to fold it back onto itself. Continue flipping the paper from side to side as you fold along the entire length of the paper. Think of this motion as similar to making a pleat or a fan. You can make the folds as thick or as thin as you'd like. Keep the folds all the same thickness, no matter what size you choose. Take the other piece of paper you cut and fold it in half lengthwise. Place the 2 longer edges on top of each other. Then create a crease by pressing down along the fold.
