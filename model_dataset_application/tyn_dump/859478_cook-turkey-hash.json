Rotate the onion 90 degrees and continue making a series of vertical cuts perpendicular to the first round. Repeat this process for the other half of the onion. Remove the skin of the onion prior to cutting. Take care not to cut all the way through for the first round of cuts by leaving the root end intact.

Gently drop 4 tablespoons (56.8 grams) of butter and your 3 chopped strips of bacon into the pan. Afterward, heat them for 5 minutes or until they turn brown and crispy. Use real butter for the best results! Mix in your peppers and onion and heat the dish for 12 minutes. Add your 1 large chopped onion, 1 chopped red bell pepper, and 1 chopped poblano pepper into the bacon and butter. Cook them for either 12 minutes or when everything becomes slightly softened. Take care to drop each ingredient into the pan gently to avoid spraying any butter. Use a fork to test the softness of your onions and peppers. If they're still firm, cook them until they soften. Stir in thyme, potatoes, garlic, turkey, and seasoning and cook for 15 minutes. Add your 1 pound (0.45 kg) of red potatoes, 1 tablespoon (4.3 grams) of chopped thyme, 3 cloves of chopped garlic, and 2 cups of shredded turkey. Now, sprinkle some salt and pepper to taste and let everything cook. Gently stir everything every 3 to 4 minutes. Move to the next step when the potatoes begin to brown. Pour in your cream, stock, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and sherry. Add your 1\u20442 cup (120 grams) of chicken stock, \u20444 cup (59 mL) of cream, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of Worcestershire sauce, 2-3 dashes hot sauce, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dry sherry into a mixing bowl.

Keep a gentle grip on the handle and angle it 45 degrees to the bowl as you gently whisk the ingredients. Take care to pour everything evenly over the hash. Mash the ingredients together and cook for 25 to 30 minutes. After adding your sauces, use your fork to gently mash the ingredients into smaller pieces. Once you're done mashing everything, use a spatula to press down firmly across the surface of the hash toward the bottom of the skillet. Now, wait about 25 to 30 minutes or until everything is browned on the bottom. When the hash is ready, it should hold together in a loose cake shape. Flip the hash and heat the uncooked side for 10 minutes. Place a 12 inch (30 cm) plate over the skillet, invert the skillet, and pour the hash onto the plate. Add the remainder of the butter into the skillet, scrape the browned bits to loosen them, and put the hash back into the pan uncooked side down. Continue cooking the hash for 10 minutes until the uncooked side is browned. After 10 minutes, the potatoes should be tender. Remove the hash from the skillet, cool, and serve! Once the hash is browned on both sides, put the 12 inch (30 cm) plate over the top of the skillet. Now, invert the skillet to pour the hash onto the plate. Let it sit for 5 minutes, cut it into quarters, and enjoy! Add some more hot sauce if it's not spicy enough for you!
