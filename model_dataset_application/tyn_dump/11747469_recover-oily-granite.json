Add more baking soda if it feels too runny, or pour in water if it\u2019s too thick to work with. You can also buy stain remover powder made for granite from a hardware store. Mix it with water so it has a similar consistency. Avoid using vinegar or hydrogen peroxide for your poultice since it can discolor or damage your granite.Tip: Test a coin-sized amount of the poultice in an inconspicuous spot on the granite, such as an area that\u2019s normally covered by an appliance, to see if it affects the color."

Press the wrap flat against the granite and poultice so it makes firm contact with them. Use masking tape around the edges of the plastic wrap to hold it in place so it doesn\u2019t come off while you\u2019re treating your stain. Avoid using duct tape since it can leave sticky residue on your countertops. You don\u2019t have to tape the edges down, but the plastic wrap may move or blow away and make the poultice dry too quickly and make it less effective. If you need to cover oily sections that are wider than the plastic wrap, overlap the pieces by 1 inch (2.5 cm) and tape them together."

Lift the corner of the plastic wrap and touch the poultice to make sure it\u2019s dry before moving on. It may take up to 2 days for the poultice to dry.

Then sweep the residue into a dustpan so you can throw it away. If you have trouble using a plastic scraper on the poultice, try using a razor blade. Keep the blade flat against the granite\u2019s surface so you don\u2019t scratch it, and be careful so you don\u2019t cut yourself."
