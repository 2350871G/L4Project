Secure the edges of the papers with double-sided tape. Glue the quilt to a wooden slat, then hang it from your wall. Choose 2 to 4 different patterns or colors for the paper. For a more realistic quilt, skip the tape and sew down the seams on your sewing machine with a straight stitch. Use saw-tooth hangers or ribbon to hang the slat."

          "description":"This is great seasonal project as you could create leaves for fall, snowflakes for winter, flowers for the spring, and suns for the summer. Use stencils or large cookie cutters to trace shapes onto colored paper. Cut these shapes out, then secure them to your wall with double-sided tape or poster putty. Your paper can be solid-colored or patterned. You can even use magazine pages! Simple shapes, such as hearts and stars work well, but you can use more complex ones too. Try snowflakes, reindeer, or bats! Match the color of the paper to the shape. For example, make stars yellow or blue, and hearts red or pink. You can put up just a few decals or create a wall mural with them."

Arrange the tubes side-by-side to create a flat disk or sunburst, then hot glue them together. Hang the sunburst from your wall with thread. The long edges of the tubes should be touching. How much space you leave in the middle is up to you. Make a smaller sunburst, then glue it on top of a larger sunburst for a layered design. For a dramatic effect, create several small sunbursts and hang them on a single wall."

Secure the butterflies to your wall with poster putty or double-sided mounting tape. Rather than folding the butterflies down the center of the body, fold the wings to either side of the body. This will give you more paper to stick to the wall. Make lots of butterflies in different colors and sizes, then stick them to your wall in a cluster. For a whimsical vibe, use glitter paint to decorate the butterflies or attaching trailing ribbons to them."

You can use more than 1 color of tissue paper. Try 3 shades of the same color for an ombre design. Work in rows from 1 side of the shape to the other.
