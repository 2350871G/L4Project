Follow the test kit instructions to get accurate results. The test will tell you the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. For example, the test will tell you if there's a surplus of nitrogen, sufficient levels, a deficiency of nitrogen, or if it's completely depleted."

Keep in mind that if you sprinkle too much, you'll burn the grass or plants. Blood meal will wash away after a strong rain, so you may need to reapply it occasionally. While blood meal may keep plant-eating pests away, it can attract meat-eaters, such as dogs, raccoons, or possums."

If you purchase the blood meal online, avoid buying it from countries that have lax laws on meat production because disease can be spread through the blood meal. For example, blood meal can't be imported to the U.S. from Europe because of the threat of Mad Cow disease. If you can't find high quality blood meal, consider using alfalfa meal or feather meal instead."

Because the plants will use the nitrogen and it will gradually wash away, reapply the blood meal every 2 months during the growing season.
