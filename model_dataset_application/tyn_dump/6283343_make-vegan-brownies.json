    "Make sure that you use the smooth kind of applesauce, and not the kind with large chunks in it.",
    "Stir in the melted chocolate and salt into the batter.",
    "If you have not yet done so, melt the chocolate using a double-boiler or the microwave, then pour it into the batter.",
    "Add the salt, then stir everything together.",
    "Add in the flour slowly, and stir it in using a whisk.",
    "Add the flour slowly while whisking your ingredients together with a whisk.",
    "Be sure to break up any clumps that you see.",
    "Fold in the chocolate chips gently.",
    "Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula while doing this.",
    "It will help make the batter more consistent.",
    "Pour the battle into the prepared pan.",
    "Use the rubber spatula to guide the batter into the baking pan.",
    "If there is any residue on the sides of the bowl, use the rubber spatula to scrape it into the bowl so that it doesn't go to waste.",
    "Bake the brownies for 25 to 28 minutes.",
    "They are ready when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean.",
    "Another way to test for doneness is to lightly touch the top.",
    "If it springs back, the brownies are done.",
    "Let the brownies cool for at least 10 minutes before you cut them and serve them.",
    "Do not take the brownies out of the pan until after you have cut them.",
    "Once you have them cut, you can serve them with some ice cream or whipped cream.",
    "Vegan Brownie Bites Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).",
    "Spray a standard-sized muffin tin with cooking spray; you can also line them with muffin liners instead.",
    "You will have enough batter to fill 8 wells, so if you have a large muffin tin, you don't end up using all of it.",
    "You can also make this recipe using a mini muffin tin.",
    "You will have enough batter to make about 24 mini brownies.",
    "Prepare your flax egg, and let it rest for 5 minutes.",
    "Pour 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of water into a small bowl.",
    "Add 2 tablespoons (15 grams) of flaxseed meal into the water.",
    "Wait 5 minutes for the flaxseed to absorb the water and thicken.",
    "These flax eggs replace the chicken eggs typically found in non-vegan brownie recipes.",
    "While the flax eggs are \"resting,\" you can start melting the butter.",
    "Melt the vegan butter, then stir in the flax eggs.",
    "You can melt the vegan butter in the microwave or in a small saucepan over the stove.",
    "Once the butter is melted, pour it into a large mixing bowl, then stir the flax eggs in with a whisk.",
    "Add the sugar, vanilla extract, baking powder, salt, and cocoa, and stir with a whisk.",
    "Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined.",
    "Your batter will still look a little thin, but this is because you have not added in the flour yet.",
    "Whisk in the flour slowly.",
    "Add the flour slowly into the batter to prevent clumping.",
    "Use a whisk to beat it into the rest of the batter well.",
    "Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often to ensure that everything mixes evenly.",
    "Fold in some vegan chocolate chips or chopped walnuts, if desired.",
    "These are not completely necessary, but they can give extra texture and flavor to your brownies.",
    "If you are baking your brownies in a mini muffin tin, consider using mini chocolate chips instead; if you want to use chopped walnuts, you may have to chop them up into smaller pieces.",
    "Fill the wells in the muffin tin three-quarters of the way full.",
    "A good way to do this would be with a tablespoon or with an ice cream scoop.",
    "This way, you can ensure that every well gets the same amount of batter.",
    "You'll also be less likely to spill and waste batter.",
    "Bake the brownies for 22 to 26 minutes.",
    "They are ready when they start to pull away from the sides of the tin.",
    "Another way to test for doneness is to touch the top; they are done if they spring back slightly.",
    "If you are baking these in a mini muffin tin, they will take about 16 minutes to bake.",
    "You might want to check from for doneness after about 10 minutes, however.",
    "Let the brownies cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then take them out.",
    "At this point, you can serve them on a plate, or let them finish cooling the rest of the way on a wire cooling rack.",
    "Finished."
