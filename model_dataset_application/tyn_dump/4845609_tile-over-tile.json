Chip away the old caulk or grout around the tile and use a crowbar to lift up the old tile. Work carefully to avoid damaging the old tile. Mix a small batch of thin-set mortar according to the manufacturer's instructions and apply it to the back of the tile. Lay the old tile back in its place.

A rough surface has more grooves in it for mortar to sink in, allowing the mortar adhere better. For that reason, roughing up the surface of the old tiles will make it easier for the new titles to stick in place. Alternatively, you could roughen the tiles by using a bundle of steel wool if an actual belt sander is not available to you."

Apply the thin-set adhesive in a single direction. Do not swirl it around. There should, however, be small groves in the thin-set. If there is a crack in your old tiled surface, you may need to use a little more thin-set than usual to fill in that crack. The thickness of the mortar should be about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).

Check the new level of your tile with a level to verify that it is now at the same level as the adjacent tiles. Since thin-set dries slowly, you should be able to remove a newly placed tile and adjust the amount of mortar as needed to fix the issue if you do not get it right on the first try."

Note, however, that you can gently clean off any wet mortar from the surface of your tiles with a wet rag before 24 hours pass. Doing so is even advised, since dry mortar is more difficult to clean off. When dry, gently tap each tile with a wooden mallet to make sure that it is secured properly. As before, loose tiles can be found by listening for a hollow sound. There should not be any loose tiles at this point, but if there are, remove the problem tiles and reapply thin-set to the back of the tile.
