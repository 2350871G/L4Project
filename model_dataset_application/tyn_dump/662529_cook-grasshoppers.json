You can simply grab them off the ground with your hands, if you're fast enough, or use a net to catch them. You can also create some of these more elaborate traps:\nDig a hole in the ground and place a Mason jar with some bait, such as oats, apples, or carrots, in it. Either place some soil around the jar or tip it on its side -- the next morning, you should find grasshoppers in the jar. Just place the lid over it and you've caught your grasshoppers! If you want 'em alive, poke some holes in the lid. Take a shoot of green willow that's about three feet long and flick it down lightly on the grasshopper. This should pin it in place."

Some people also pull the head straight off, which removes the guts (including the stomach).
