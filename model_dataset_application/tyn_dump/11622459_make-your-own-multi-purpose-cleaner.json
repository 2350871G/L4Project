    "As a plus, it will leave your home smelling like pine trees!",
    "Use a measuring cup to measure out \u20444 cup (59 mL) of pine cleaning oil and add it to the solution.",
    "Stir it well with a narrow spoon, knife, or straw.",
    "Some pine oil cleaners are merely pine-scented don't contain pine oil.",
    "Check the label to ensure it's made up of 8% to 12% pine oil.",
    "This solution can be used on any surface unless you\u2019ve used detergent containing bleach.",
    "If you\u2019ve used bleach, don\u2019t use this formula on porous surfaces like wood, natural stone, and drywall.",
    "Note that pine cleaning oil is not the same as pine essential oil.",
    "Store the spray bottle in a cool place out of reach of children and pets.",
    "Ingesting any cleaning solution that contains pine oil and laundry detergent is poisonous and can be fatal.",
    "Place the bottle in a high cupboard that children and pets can\u2019t get to.",
    "The solution will continue to work for 1 year, but it\u2019s most effective if you use it within 6 to 8 months.",
    "Note that the hot water will turn cold as you store it.",
    "The solution will still disinfect, but it won\u2019t be as powerful.",
    "Creating an Aromatic Vinegar Cleaner Fill a spray bottle halfway full with white vinegar.",
    "The acidity in vinegar can break down grime and soap scum, so it's a great natural alternative to common cleaning chemicals.",
    "Choose a spray bottle of any size and fill it up halfway with plain white vinegar.",
    "Note that vinegar isn't a disinfectant so it won't kill bacteria like staphylococcus.",
    "As an alternative, use distilled vinegar or apple cider vinegar.",
    "Fill the rest of the bottle with plain water.",
    "Hold the bottle under the faucet and fill it to the top.",
    "The less water you use, the more potent the cleaner will be.",
    "However, it's still important to dilute it so you can use the solution on any surface.",
    "For instance, you can use undiluted vinegar to clean heavy grime or soap scum off of porcelain, but it will leave a cloudy residue if you use it on windows or mirrors.",
    "Add fresh citrus rind or essential oils for scent if desired.",
    "Put 4 or 5 lemon or orange peels into the bottle to add a hint of citrus aroma.",
    "Or, use 5 to 10 drops of your favorite essential oil to give your all-purpose cleaner a fresh scent.",
    "Sweet orange, eucalyptus, ylang-ylang, and lavender are all great choices if you dislike the smell of vinegar because they\u2019re strong, distinctive scents.",
    "Essential oils won\u2019t entirely mask the smell of vinegar, but they can dampen it.",
    "Tea tree oil has antimicrobial properties, so it's the perfect way to increase the cleaning power of your homemade cleaner.",
    "Adding scent won't entirely mask the smell of vinegar, but it will help!",
    "Note that if you use fresh citrus peels, you\u2019ll need to remove them 24 hours after mixing the solution to prevent them from rotting.",
    "To remove them, pour the mixture through a sieve into another container then pour it back into the original spray bottle.",
    "Shake the bottle before using it each time.",
    "Give the bottle a quick shake before you start spraying surfaces.",
    "This will ensure your added scents are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.",
    "If you didn't use added scents, you don't need to shake the bottle.",
    "Avoid using a vinegar solution on hardwood floors, granite, marble, natural stone, and aluminum surfaces because it can cause discoloration and etching.",
    "Store the bottle out of reach from children and pets for up to 2 years.",
    "Vinegar is an eye irritant, so put the bottle of natural cleaner in a place where children and pets can\u2019t access it.",
    "If you have hydrogen peroxide in your home, place the vinegar-based cleaner away from it or in a different cupboard altogether.",
    "If the vinegar solution accidentally gets in your eyes, flush them with water for 2 minutes.",
    "If you, your child, or your pet has swallowed the solution and is experiencing severe pain, call poison control right away.",
    "If you used fresh citrus peels, remove them from the cleaner 24 hours after mixing the solution to prevent them from rotting.",
    "Cleaning with an Ammonia Solution Fill a 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) spray bottle with 3.5 cups (830 mL) of water.",
    "Ammonia is extremely strong, so it needs to be heavily diluted to be safe to use on household surfaces.",
    "It makes a great kitchen cleaner because it can remove buildup and stains from animal fats (grease), vegetable oils, and wine.",
    "Note that an ammonia-based cleaner will not kill staphylococcus bacteria.",
    "Protect your mouth, hands, and eyes before opening ammonia.",
    "Ammonia can irritate your eyes and skin, so wrap a bandana or nose-and-mouth mask around your face, wear protective glasses or goggles, and put on rubber gloves before handling and opening the bottle.",
    "If you wear contact lenses, take them out before working with the ammonia because they can trap gas and trap the ammonia vapors in your eyes.",
    "Place the spray bottle in the sink and add \u20448 cup (30 mL) of sudsy ammonia.",
    "Place the spray bottle in the sink in case you spill any of the sudsy ammonia.",
    "Putting it in the sink will also prevent you from leaning over the bottle as you pour in the ammonia.",
    "Leaning over the bottle will give the fumes direct access to your face, so keep both bottles as far away from your face as possible.",
    "If you can't find sudsy ammonia in stores, you can make your own by adding a dime-sized amount of bleach-free liquid dish soap to regular ammonia.",
    "It's important to use bleach-free dish soap because ammonia and bleach create toxic vapors.",
    "Shake the bottle and use it on ovens, stoves, glass, concrete, and grills.",
    "Ammonia will eat away at grime and stains and leave your oven, oven racks, stove, and grill looking brand new.",
    "Spray it on, let it sit for 10 to 20 minutes, and then wipe down the surface with a rag.",
    "To clean glass, spray it on and wipe it away immediately just like you would with a regular glass cleaner.",
    "To deep clean your oven racks, make a large batch of ammonia cleaning solution and place it in a large plastic tub.",
    "Place the oven racks in the tub and let them soak for 15 to 20 minutes before taking them out and wiping them clean.",
    "To clean concrete stains in your driveway or garage, spray it on the surface and let it sit for 20 minutes.",
    "Then scrub the stain with a bristle brush or old toothbrush.",
    "This solution can also be used on porcelain bathroom tiles or kitchen backsplashes.",
    "If you have breathing problems or lung-health issues, avoid using this solution because it may irritate your lungs.",
    "Store ammonia-based cleaner in a cupboard away from heat, children, and pets.",
    "Ammonia isn\u2019t flammable, but it\u2019s best to keep it away from heat or open flames.",
    "Store it in a cleaning closet, cupboard, or garage where children and pets can\u2019t get to it.",
    "If you accidentally inhale a lot of ammonia vapors and experience trouble breathing or a burning sensation in your throat, call an ambulance right away.",
    "If you accidentally get the ammonia-based solution in your eyes, flush them with water and call for emergency medical care as soon as possible.",
    "If you spill the solution on your skin or clothing, thoroughly wash your skin with water.",
    "If it gets on your clothing, remove your clothes and wash your skin underneath the area where it spilled."
