  "text":" Making Simple Heart Shaped Cheese Quesadillas Cut your tortillas into hearts using a heart shaped cookie cutter. Lay out your 8 tortillas onto a cutting board and press down on the surface of the tortilla with a heart shaped cookie cutter. You can purchase heart shaped cookie cutters online or at most major department and craft stores. Layer a couple of tortillas over each other to cut them faster. Lay your heart tortillas onto a greased cooking sheet. Grease a standard 9 x 13 in (22.9 x 33 cm) cooking sheet with a cooking spray or olive oil so that your tortillas don't stick to the pan as they cook. Sprinkle the grated cheddar on the tortillas. Put the cheese in the center of the tortilla in a little pile. Try to get an even distribution of cheese on all the tortillas so that they taste similar. Place another heart tortilla over the cheese. Line up 8 more of your tortilla hearts and place them over the existing tortillas with cheese on your cooking sheet. This will complete the preparation portion for your quesadillas. Heat your oven to 325\u00b0F (162.7\u00b0C) and cook for three minutes. Preheat your oven and bring it up to 325\u00b0F (162.7\u00b0C). Place the cooking sheet on the middle rack and continue to cook them for three minutes. Once they are done cooking, take them out and allow them to cool. The cheese inside of the quesadilla should be completely melted. Allow quesadillas to cool and serve. Allow your quesadillas to cool for a minute. Do not let your quesadillas sit for too long before serving, because the cheese will harden as it's out of the oven. Sprinkle salt over the top of your quesadillas to finish seasoning them and serve them. Making Bacon and Cheese Quesadillas Cut your tortilla into a large heart shape. Use a sharp pointed knife to cut out a heart shape over a cutting board. The heart should take up the majority of the tortilla. The smaller that you cut the heart, the smaller your quesadilla will be. Brush one side of each tortilla. You should only brush one side of the tortilla so that the other side of your quesadilla is dry and cool enough to be eaten with your hands. If you don't have a cooking brush, you can use a napkin, paper towels, or your hands to spread olive oil over the surface of your tortilla. Fry bacon on the stovetop. Lay your bacon onto a hot skillet and cook each side for 7-8 minutes or until it becomes crispy and brown. If you like crispier bacon, allow it to cook for a minute or two extra on each side before taking it out of the pan. Set your bacon aside in a bowl lined with a paper towel. Fry the tortilla on the stovetop on high until brown. You will only need to cook one side of each piece of tortilla that you have. The heat generated from cooking that side of the tortilla will melt the cheese once you sprinkle it over the tortilla. Spread the Primula cheese over the tortilla.
