  "text":" Fold an origami box from a coloured square of paper.  Rotate the other square of coloured paper in front of you, so that it appears as a diamond. (If you have paper coloured on both sides, the side that faces up now is the colour that will show in the end.) Crease the paper horizontally and vertically, as shown.  Turn the paper over and rotate it 45 degrees, so that it appears as a square.  Fold it horizontally and vertically.  Divide the square into thirds both ways, as explained in this article, using the template square. (You will see a small square created by the fold lines in the middle of the paper.) Fold the bottom edge up to meet the bottom one-third line (one side of the central square, just created).  Repeat with the other three sides.  Unfold completely.  Fold all four corners inwards to meet the corners of the inner square.  Fold all four sides inwards to meet the sides of the small square.  Pick the paper up and fold the diagonal fold lines outwards and horizontal fold lines inwards. This forms a double-layered triangle, known as the waterbomb-base. Press your new triangle flat.  Fold its upper tip down as far as possible.  Insert your finger between the double layers of the triangle and push the upper layer upwards. This turns the model 3-D. Observe the line that runs down the center.  Pinch this line, so that it folds upwards.  Smooth all the folds into their positions, so that your model looks like the one on the photo.  Insert it into your origami box that you folded earlier, and you're done! ",
