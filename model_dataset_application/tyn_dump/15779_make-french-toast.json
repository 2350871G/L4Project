Then, mix in 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vanilla extract, followed by 1 teaspoon (2.6 grams) of cinnamon. It's important to add the ingredients separately, since delicate eggs whites need to incorporate ingredients one at a time. Use whole milk for a higher fat content, if desired. The more fat, the thicker and richer the batter will be. If you want a sweeter taste, you can add \u00bc cup (32 grams) of sugar or a dash of honey to the mixture as well. Adding \u00bc teaspoon (1.4 grams) of salt can help smooth out the mixture."
