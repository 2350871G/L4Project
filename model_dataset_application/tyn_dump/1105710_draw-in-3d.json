The square can be a variety of sizes, but it should only take up a quarter of the page at most. Center it on the page, so there is room to draw the rest of the box. In the final drawing, this first square will serve as the front of your box."

Begin by drawing the bottom line of the second square so its center intersects with the center of the left side of the first square. Then draw the right side of the second square so that its center intersects with the center of the top of the first square. Then finish drawing the top and left side of the second square. The second square should be exactly the same size as the first square. This second square will be the back of the cube in the final drawing."

Erase any line that you wouldn't be able to see from the angle you have drawn. Lines to erase include the bottom right-hand side connecting line, the right-hand side of the second square, and the bottom line of the second square.

For instance, if you are looking straight down a road, there is a point in the distance where you can no longer see the road.
