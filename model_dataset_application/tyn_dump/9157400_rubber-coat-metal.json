You can also aim a heat gun at these spots to dry them more quickly. Hold the gun a few inches away from the metal and move it in small circles or lines so you\u2019re not heating the same spot for too long."

Once you\u2019ve applied your final coat, leave the rubber to dry and harden overnight, or for at least four hours before you attempt to use the object. Wait until it\u2019s completely dry to remove the wire. Using a Liquid Rubber Spray Purchase a liquid rubber spray product. Visit a hardware or home improvement store and buy liquid rubber in a spray can. Choose from a variety of colors and finishes to customize the metal however you\u2019d like. Cover your work area with a tarp or newspaper. Lay down a tarp or dropcloth where you plan to work so that you don\u2019t spray the product onto the floor. You can also lay down some newspaper, but be sure to tape it down so that it doesn\u2019t move while you\u2019re spraying. Avoid spraying outside on a windy day since the product could wind up on you or nearby objects. Tape off areas of the metal you don\u2019t want coated.

You can also tape a plastic dropcloth to the object if there\u2019s a large area you don\u2019t want to get sprayed. If you\u2019re spraying a car rim, you can wedge playing cards under the edge of the rim all the way around the wheel so you don\u2019t spray the tire. Wear protective gear. To protect yourself from inhaling any of the rubber spray, wear a safety mask. You can also put on rubber gloves if you\u2019re concerned about getting any paint on your hands. Shake the can for one minute. Without touching the nozzle, shake the can up and down for about one minute to thoroughly mix up the contents and get the can ready to spray. Spray on one coat from a distance of 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm). Holding the can upright, press down on the nozzle and spray the metal from 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) away. Keep the can moving and just spray a thin layer of rubber over the entire surface you want coated. Let the metal dry for 30 minutes. Allow the metal to dry for about 30 minutes in between coats. Don\u2019t remove any of the tape or plastic covering the metal during this time. Repeat the spraying process six to eight times. Continue to apply thin layers of rubber to the metal, and let each layer dry for 30 minutes before applying the next one. Do this about six to eight times, or until you\u2019re happy with the look of the finish. Finish one side before flipping it to coat the other. If you need to spray it at a different angle or spray the other side, wait until all coats have dried on the first side. Then, 30 minutes after your final coat, turn the object and begin applying coats to the other side. Allow the rubber to harden overnight. Leave your metal where it is with its new rubber coating, and let it dry overnight, or for at least four hours.
