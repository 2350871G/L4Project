          "description":"If you are storing nuts harvested from your own yard or purchased at a local market, you may need to freeze the nuts for two days prior to storing them to kill off any pests or eggs. Insect eggs and larvae thrive at room temperature. Your eye may not see any pests on the surface of the nuts you collect, but that does not mean that there are no pests to be found. As such, fresh nuts need to be sterilized via freezing. If you are storing commercially purchased nuts, you should not need to freeze them. The manufacturer should have killed off the nuts before selling them. Place the nuts in an airtight container and sit that container inside the freezer. Allow the nuts to remain there for 48 hours at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) or lower."

Plastic and glass containers are better than plastic bags. Plastic bags are permeable, so even though the bags have a good seal, odors can still seep into the space and taint the flavor of the nuts."

Chestnuts should never be stored at room temperature. They lose moisture quickly and can actually develop mold. If you do store chestnuts at room temperature, make sure that you use them within two weeks, since mold usually develops when kept past this amount of time. Light can cause the nuts to go rancid at a quicker pace, so you should never store them on a shelf, kitchen counter, or other exposed area."

Note that insect eggs and larvae are not an issue when you plan on refrigerating freshly harvested nuts. Even if there are eggs on the nuts you harvested, prolonged storage in cool temperatures should prevent those eggs from hatching. Glass and plastic jars are better than plastic bags. Nuts have a tendency to absorb odors, so the container must have a good seal and should be made from non-permeable material. Otherwise, the flavor of the nuts could become tainted during storage."

          "description":"Place the container of nuts in a refrigerator set to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) or below. When stored in this manner, most nuts will last for one year. Some varieties may go rancid quicker than that, however. Almonds, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts should remain fresh for one year. This is true regardless of whether you keep them in their shells or remove the shells prior to storage. When kept in their shells, chestnuts will only stay fresh for two to three months in a refrigerator. When the shell is removed, chestnuts can remain fresh for one year. Chestnuts are high in starch and lose moisture quickly, so they go rancid faster than most other nuts do. Heat and light can make the nuts go rancid faster, so storing them in a dark, cold place lengthens the amount of time the nuts stay fresh."

The container itself must also be both clean and free of moisture. Since you will be freezing the nuts as you store them, you do not need to do any preliminary freezing to kill off any insect eggs or larvae. Plastic bags are an acceptable storage medium, but hard plastic or glass containers are better choices. Bags are permeable, so odors can still find their way inside, thereby tainting the taste and quality of the nuts."

Some varieties may last longer. Almonds and chestnuts will usually stay fresh in the freezer for at least one year. Pecans and walnuts can be stored for two years, and pistachios usually last for as many as three years. These time periods apply to nuts stored in their shells as well as nuts that have been shelled before storage. Both heat and light can make nuts go rancid at a much faster pace.
