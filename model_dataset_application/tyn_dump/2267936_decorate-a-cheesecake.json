  "text":" Using Strawberries and Whipped Cream Take the cake out of the pan shortly before you plan on serving it. It is best to decorate this cake just before you plan on serving it, so plan accordingly. Consider spreading a thin layer of jam or curd on top of the cake. Although not necessary, this will give the cheesecake extra flavor. It will also give the strawberries something to stick to. Cut the strawberries into thin slices. Use a paring knife to chop off the stems first, then to cut the strawberries into \u215b to \u00bc-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) thick slices. Leave one strawberry whole for the center. You can also choose to leave the strawberries whole. Arrange the strawberries on top of the cheesecake in overlapping rings. Staring from the edge of the cake, arrange the strawberries side-by-side, with the pointy ends facing out. Keep setting down the strawberries in rings, overlapping each one slightly, until you reach the center of the cake. The strawberries will start to stand up as you reach the center, sort of like a flower. Place the remaining, whole strawberry in the center. If you are using whole strawberries, place the strawberries stem-side down onto the cake. You won't be able to overlap them. Prepare the whipped cream topping. Whip the heavy whipping cream using an electric mixer or handheld beater until it starts to thicken. Add the powdered sugar, and continue to mix it until it forms stiff peaks. You can also use a food processor fitted with whisks for this step. Use a piping bag fitted with a star-shaped decorating tip to pipe the frosting around the edge of the cake. It's okay if the frosting overlaps the strawberries a little. If you have any frosting left over, consider piping more \"starts\" around the base of the cake. Prepare the glaze. Stir together the cornstarch and water in a small saucepan using a whisk. Add the jelly and cook over medium-high heat until the jelly has dissolved and the mixture thickened. Be sure to stir continuously. Take the glaze off the heat, stir in the liqueur/lemon juice and let it cool. If you want to give the glaze a more vibrant color, stir in some red food coloring. You can speed up the cooling process by placing the saucepan into an ice bath (a large pot or sink filled with ice) or by sticking it into the fridge. Pour the glaze over the cake. You can pour it just over the strawberries, or extend it past the frosting and let it spread down the sides of the cake. Using Chocolate Ganache Take the cake out of the pan a few hours before you plan on serving it. Loosen and remove the sides of the springform pan. The chocolate ganache will need a few hours to cool and set, so it is best to decorate this cake 2 to 4 hours before you serve it. Heat the heavy cream and the butter in the microwave. Pour the heavy cream into a heat-safe mug, then add the butter. Cook it in the microwave for 2 minutes, stirring it every 30 seconds. If you don't own a microwave, heat the heavy cream and butter in a small saucepan until both melt. Pour the heavy cream over the chocolate chips. Place the chocolate chips into a bowl, then pour the heavy cream over them. You can use milk chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate for this. Let the mixture sit for 30 seconds, then stir it with a whisk. Keep stirring until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often. Let the mixture cool, then pour it over the top of the cheesecake. Let the mixture cool for about 15 minutes first so that it can thicken. Next, pour the mixture evenly over the top of the cheesecake. Arrange fresh raspberries on top, if you'd like. You can also add other types of berries too, such as blueberries and black berries. Sift some powdered sugar over the top of the berries for that final touch. Put the cheesecake into the fridge for 2 to 4 hours before serving it. This will allow the chocolate ganache to cool and set. Using Stencils and Cocoa Powder Find a stencil. You can cut your own stencil, or use a pre-made one, such as a doily or a piece of lace. The stencil should be a little bit wider or larger than your cake so that you will have something to lift it up with. Choose your powder. Popular choices include powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and powdered, dehydrated fruit. Choose something that will contrast nicely with your cheesecake. Cocoa powder will show up the best on plain cheesecake, but powdered sugar will show up nicely on a chocolate ganache-covered cheesecake. You can create an ombre design by using three batches of cocoa powder. One batch is pure cocoa powder, while the other two have varying amounts of powdered sugar mixed into them. Sift your powder onto a sheet of wax paper. Hold a fine, mesh sieve over a sheet of wax paper. Pour your chosen powder into it, then tap it to sift the powder onto the wax paper. Carefully discard any clumps. If you are using more than one powder, sift the powder onto separate pieces of wax paper. If you don't have any wax paper, you can use a plate instead. Place the stencil down onto the cake. Gently press it against the surface of the cake so that it sticks. Sift the powder over the cake. Place the powder back into the sieve. Hold the sieve over the cake, and gently tap it to sift your powder over the stencil. You can use as much or as little powder as you want. Keep in mind that if you use too thick of a layer, the design is more likely to \"smudge.\" If there are bits of the stencil that are curling up, hold them down. If you are creating an ombre design: dust one third of the cake with pure cocoa powder, dust the next third with your cocoa powder and sugar mix, and the final third with your powdered sugar and cocoa mix. Grab the edges of the stencil, then carefully lift it away. Hold the stencil as flat as you can so that the powder doesn't fall back onto the cake. Once the stencil is out of the way, dump the excess powder into the sink. Finished. ",
