If you\u2019re not working with a specific garment, measure over the curve of the top of your shoulder.

Cutting out the Batting and Fabric Trace the right shoulder pad pattern onto quilters\u2019 batting twice. Pin the paper pattern onto a piece of quilters\u2019 batting, with the \u201cR\u201d side up. With a fabric marker or pencil, trace around the edges.

Carefully cut around each pattern piece that you traced with sharp fabric scissors.

Pin your paper pattern onto the wrong side of a piece of lining fabric. Then, trace around the pattern piece. Use a ruler to mark 1 in (2.5 cm) of seam allowance around the entire piece. Do this once for the \u201cR\u201d side and once for the \u201cL\u201d side. The lining fabric you choose should match the fabric on the inside of your garment. If you\u2019re working with a red blazer that\u2019s lined in black fabric, you should select a similar black fabric to use for covering the shoulder pads. Constructing the Shoulder Pads Sandwich 2 layers of batting together and pin them. Pair up the matching \u201cR\u201d and \u201cL\u201d pieces and pin them together. This will create a thicker shoulder pad that has 1 layer of batting. If you want your shoulder pads to have graduated thickness, cut out a series of progressively smaller pieces. Use fabric spray adhesive to secure the pieces together in a stack. You\u2019ll place another full-sized piece of batting over the top to smooth over the levels. Use a sewing machine to straight stitch around the edges of the stack. Sew a straight stitch around the perimeter to hold the layers of batting together. Mark 2 darts on the curved edge of the batting. The first dart will take in \u20444 in (0.64 cm) and the second, larger dart will take in \u20442 in (1.3 cm). The larger dart should go on the side with more volume which will be positioned towards the back of the shoulder. They can both be about 2 in (5.1 cm) deep. Mark these with a fabric marker or pencil. Pin and machine sew the darts. Pin in the darts on both shoulder pads, making sure you\u2019re taking in volume from both of the 2 layers of batting. Sew the darts closed using a machine straight stitch. Trim away the loose threads. Fold and pin the seam allowance of the lining fabric over the batting. Place the batting onto the wrong side of the corresponding \u201cR\u201d and \u201cL\u201d pieces of lining fabric. Position it in the center and begin folding the 1 in (2.5 cm) seam allowance toward the inside. Pin around the edges. The lining fabric should now be enclosing the edges of the batting. Take care in folding around the corners so that the seam allowance doesn\u2019t stick out or add too much bulk. Machine sew around the perimeter of the shoulder pads. Sew a straight stitch \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the folded edge. Now, your lining fabric should be totally enclosing all edges of the batting. Trim away the raw edges of the lining fabric. Trim away the excess seam allowance. If you have pinking shears, use these when trimming away the seam allowance so that the raw edges of the lining fabric won\u2019t fray.
