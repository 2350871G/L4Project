Plump sweet potatoes store just as well as skinny ones, and they have more usable \"meat\" to consume. If harvesting the sweet potatoes yourself, use a spade fork to dig 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) beneath the soil in order to get all the roots up. Handle them carefully since sweet potatoes tend to bruise easily, and shake off excess dirt but do not wash the roots."

          "description":"Keep the roots in a room or other location that reaches between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 and 27 degrees Celsius) with relative humidity of 90 to 95 percent. The sweet potatoes need to cure for at least 7 days, but they can be kept there for as many as 14 days. The curing process creates a second skin that forms over scratches and bruises, allowing the sweet potatoes to last longer in storage. Use a small electric fan in the area to keep the air circulating. This helps to prevent rotting and molding. Monitor the temperature and humidity regularly to make sure that the sweet potatoes are sitting in the conditions needed for proper curing. For best results, keep the sweet potatoes from touching each other as they cure."

For best results, store the sweet potatoes in a basement or root cellar. If neither option is available to you, store them in a dark, cool, and well-ventilated cupboard or pantry away from strong heat sources. Do not use a refrigerator. Monitor the temperature frequently to make sure that it does not fall below or rise above this range. Stored in this manner, the sweet potatoes can last up to 6 months.

You need to cook the sweet potatoes before you can freeze them, as raw sweet potatoes tend to break down and lose both flavor and nutrients in the freezer. Boiling is the preferred method of cooking sweet potatoes for freezer storage. The boiling process should take about 20 minutes for a standard-size sweet potato."
