You can also get wood-backed or clear stamps. Clear stamps will give more control over placement because you\u2019ll be able to see exactly where the edge of the stamp is. Use permanent ink for quick-drying and precise lines. The lines created with a rubber stamp that uses permanent ink are very sharp and will dry quickly.

Run your finger over the top of the stamp. This is especially important if you\u2019re using a larger stamp. Running your finger over the top ensures an even application of ink without you having to rock and wiggle the stamp. Pick the stamp straight up.

You can also stamp over still-wet designs to create a more integrated look. This is an especially cool look if you\u2019re using water-based markers, since the inks will often bleed into one another. Inking Your Stamp with Water-Based Markers Choose your water-based markers. Water-based markers are good if you want different parts of the stamp to come out in different colors. You should first make a design plan so you know for sure which colors need to go where on the stamp. Color on the stamp directly. Using the water-based markers, color the stamp. You can have some overlap between colors since water-based markers will blend into one another. Breathe on the stamp. Once you\u2019re finished coloring the stamp, breathe directly on it to re-wet the ink. The ink should be shiny before you stamp it to ensure all of the color transfers to the cardstock or paper you\u2019re using. Inking Your Stamp with Paint Dip a sponge into your paint. You can use craft paint or even regular paint if you\u2019re stamping on furniture or walls. If you\u2019re working on a larger project, pour some of your paint onto a paper towel. This will act as a big ink pad. Sponge the paint onto the stamp. Tap the sponge onto the stamp repeatedly. Keep doing this until you see an even coat of paint on the stamp.

Don't favor one side of the stamp over the other. This can make one part of your stamped area look really light, while other parts look darker. Instead, place your palm over the center of the stamp and press down evenly. Masking with a Rubber Stamp Load your stamp with your desired type and color of ink. You can use whatever type of ink you like, since the steps for this method aren\u2019t time sensitive. Press down firmly with the stamp. Avoid rocking the stamp back and forth. Then pull the stamp straight up to avoid any smearing. Make a second stamp on a scrap piece of paper. This scrap stamping will act as a shield for the design you just stamped on your main material. Once you\u2019ve stamped the design on a spare piece of paper, cut out the design out, following the edges closely. Place this over the design you stamped on your card or paper to cover it. Reload your stamp. Then place it carefully next to the original stamp that you covered with the scrap stamp. This allows you to get really close to the original design without worrying about stamping over it. Press the stamp down firmly. Cleaning and Storing Your Stamps and Ink Wipe your stamp with alcohol-free baby wipes after use. This removes all of the ink or paint on the stamp.
