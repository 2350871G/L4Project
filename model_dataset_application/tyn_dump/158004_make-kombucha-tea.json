    "A fermentation/incubation container.  It is recommended that this container be made of food-grade glass. Use of other materials (i.e. ceramic, metal, and/or plastic) may leach chemicals (including lead if using ceramic) into the ferment due to the natural acidic generation within the kombucha fermentation process. Some have claimed good success with stainless steel and food-grade plastic, but glass is preferred. Anywhere between a quart to a gallon should be a good starting point. Most people start with 1oz per day, as the digestive tract may need some time to get used to the kombucha. The volume of the container thereafter should be based on the rate at which you will be consuming the beverage, as well as the available area in which you can let the ferment sit. Brewing equipment, such as 5-gallon carboys for brewing beer or wine will work very well.",
    "A lint-free, tightly woven cloth (such as a clean T-shirt). This will be used to cover the fermentation container to keep insects, particularly fruit flies, dust, and other foreign particulates from contaminating the culture while allowing the microorganisms to breathe. The cloth will need to be larger than the opening area of the fermentation container.",

    "A large pot for heating water and adding tea and sugar. Stainless steel works well. It should be large enough to hold the volume of fluid in the fermentation container.",
