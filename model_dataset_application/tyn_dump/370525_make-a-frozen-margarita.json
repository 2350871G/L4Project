The result is a colorful cocktail that looks as good as it tastes! Try to pick flavors with different colors so the layers stand out. For example, lime is a pale neon green, strawberry is red, and mango is bright orange. Be careful not to stir the margarita after you pour it. Drink it immediately, too, because the colors will start to blend once it begins melting."
