  "text":" Cooking the Pasta Al Dente Buy authentic fettuccine pasta. Fettuccine pasta comes in narrow ribbons and is made from egg and flour. Look for pasta that has a slightly textured surface, as this will make it easier for the sauce to stick to the pasta. Bring a 5.678 L (6 qt) pot of salty water to a boil.

If the pasta is still too hard, give it up to an extra 2 minutes. Be careful when you\u2019re tasting the pasta, as the water will be very hot. Drain your pasta and save 473 mL (2.00  c) of pasta water. Drain the pasta in the sink using a colander. If you are making butter sauce, you will want to save 473 mL (2.00  c) of pasta water, because pasta water is a key ingredient in the sauce. Making the Butter Sauce Pour 236.59 mL (1.0000  c) of pasta water into a saucepan. Save the other half of the pasta water for adjusting the consistency of the sauce later. Keep the saucepan on medium heat. Slice butter into pieces and whisk them into the pasta water. Add the pieces of butter one at a time, letting them melt completely before adding the next one. Let the butter melt completely so that the cheese will not clump up in the mixture. Add 75 g (3/4 cup) of grated parmigiano reggiano cheese.

Fettuccine alfredo tastes best when it\u2019s fresh, but it can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container or plastic bag for 3-5 days. Cooking the Cream Sauce Coat the bottom of a large saucepan in olive oil. The amount of olive oil that you will need will depend on the size of your saucepan, but aim to completely cover the entire bottom of the pan. Add minced garlic and onion to the oil, and cook on low heat. Stir the onion and garlic pieces so that they are coated in the oil. Cook the pieces until they are soft. Test their softness by pressing down on them with your spoon. They should be pretty mushy, and the garlic should be browned. Make sure that the onion and the garlic are minced very finely, because you wouldn\u2019t want to bite into a big chunk of onion or garlic in your pasta.
