The warmer the water, the better it will be for loosening stuck-on dirt and grime. Before you start mopping, make sure you've cleared the floor of all removable furniture, appliances and other objects that might get in the way or be damaged by water.

Vinegar is mildly acidic, which makes it useful for dissolving hardened residue. Diluting the vinegar will prevent it from bleaching the color or wearing down the finish of your floor tiles. Other high-potency types of vinegar, such as apple cider vinegar, will also get the job done."

Don\u2019t forget to run the mop beneath nearby furniture and along the baseboards. As you mop, you should be able to see the results of the vinegar right away. Be careful not to saturate bordering wood or carpet flooring with the vinegar solution."

This will help clear the tiles of loose residue and any remaining traces of vinegar. Soak up excess water with the mop, a squeegee or an absorbent towel, the allow it to air dry completely. If you skip the rinsing step, the dingy water will dry on the floor, leaving behind streaks and splotches. Making sure that the grout has a chance to dry out is essential for preventing the growth of mold and mildew, which thrive in warm, moist spaces."

This foaming action will make it much easier for the vinegar and baking soda combination to penetrate down into the tiny pores of the grout.

Once you\u2019re finished, give the floor a thorough rinse using a wet rag or sponge, then leave it to air dry. Special brushes designed for cleaning grout can be bought cheap at all home improvement stores. Alternatively, you might also use a long-handled kitchen dish scrubber. Repurpose an old toothbrush and use it to clean grout. The narrow head of the brush coupled with the long handle make it the perfect tool for getting down into the spaces between tiles. Scrubbing grout by hand can be time-consuming, but it\u2019s without a doubt the most effective means of restoring it to its original color."
