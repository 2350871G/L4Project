Put 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt in the other side of the bowl so it doesn't touch the yeast. Whisk the dry ingredients together until they're combined. Combining just the yeast and salt could kill the yeast, so it's important to keep them separate."

Use a wooden spoon to stir the bread dough well. The dough should be tough to stir and it will look shaggy. Avoid using boiling or hot water which could kill the yeast."

The whole ball of dough should be covered with the cooking spray to prevent it from sticking to the plastic wrap. Tear off a sheet of plastic wrap and cover the bowl with it. If you don't want to use cooking spray, you can spread a little olive oil over the dough. Just dip a pastry brush in the oil and spread the oil all over the ball of dough."

This proves the dough and lets the yeast activate so the bread will rise. You dough should start looking bubbly and bigger after 6 hours. If you don't have a warm space in your kitchen, turn on your oven's light and place the bowl in the oven. Close the oven door and leave the light on. This will create a small warm space to prove the dough."

Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and let it sit in a warm place for one more hour. This will knock any air bubbles out of the dough before it does its final prove."
