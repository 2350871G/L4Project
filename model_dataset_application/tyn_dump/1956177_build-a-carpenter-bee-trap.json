Making this angle helps later with creating tunnels for the bees to enter. You could also do it without cutting the post at an angle, but it makes the tunnels trickier to line up. If you don\u2019t wish to do this, you could leave the top alone and instead make a tunnel all the way through the post.

The angled top prevents light from filtering into the trap\u2019s tunnels, so the bees won\u2019t have as much of an opportunity to escape. If you don\u2019t plan on cutting the top, try nailing a board to it. The board will cover up any holes as well as give you a place to safely install a hanging mechanism."

    "If you don\u2019t want to use a breakable jar, get a few plastic soda bottles instead.",
    "Try cutting open one bottle and stapling the bottom half to the trap.",
    "Fit a second bottle half over it to hold the bees.",
    "Use a marker to mark the spots you need to punch through the lid.",
    "Use a ruler to measure the lid\u2019s diameter.",
    "Find where the center is and mark it.",
    "Then, calculate the halfway points between the center and the rim of the lid.",
    "Mark these spots as well.",
    "Make sure you measure across the center of the lid.",
    "Hold the ruler very still until you\u2019re done so the spots are properly aligned.",
    "The center marking will be an opening for the bees to crawl through.",
    "The other spots are there to secure the lid to the trap.",
    "Use a metal punch to poke holes through the lid.",
    "Set the lid on top of a piece of scrap wood.",
    "Then, position a metal punch over one of the marks.",
    "Hammer the opposite end of the punch until it breaks through the lid.",
    "Repeat this with the other marks you made..",
    "The punch can damage any surface underneath it.",
    "Work over something you don\u2019t plan on keeping, such as a piece of scrap wood.",
    "Widen the center hole using a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) metal drill bit.",
    "This time you\u2019re going to need to drill through a harder material, so make sure you\u2019re using a heavy-duty bit designed to cut through metal.",
    "Drill down through the center hole to widen it.",
    "Keep widening it until it matches the tunnel hole you made on the bottom of the wood post.",
    "Be careful not to damage anything underneath the thin lid.",
    "Hold it down firmly against a piece of scrap wood that the drill bit can pass through without issue.",
    "Throw away the scrap wood when you\u2019re done.",
    "If you use the wrong drill bit, it could burn out your drill as well as ruin the lid, so choose carefully.",
    "Screw the lid to the underside of the trap.",
    "Place the lid back inside the Mason jar\u2019s ring.",
    "Then, position the ring over the hole on the bottom edge of the wood post.",
    "Fit a pair of \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wood screws into the smaller holes you punched through the lid.",
    "Finish securing the lid by using a screwdriver to turn the screws clockwise.",
    "Screw the holes straight into the wood so they don\u2019t end up crossing into the bee tunnel.",
    "Then, make sure the lid is securely in place before attempting to position a Mason jar on it.",
    "Make a pilot hole through the trap\u2019s top if you plan on hanging it.",
    "You will need a wood drill bit approximately \u20448 in (0.32 cm) in size.",
    "Flip the trap over so the Mason jar side is facedown.",
    "Position your drill bit along the center of the trap, then drill down into it.",
    "This hole only needs to be short so it doesn\u2019t reach the bee tunnels you made earlier.",
    "The length of the hole depends on the length of the eye screw you plan on using.",
    "It needs to be the same length as the screw.",
    "Normally, it will be 2 in (5.1 cm) or less.",
    "If you made your bee trap differently, be careful not to drill all the way through the wood.",
    "For instance, if you made a box using flat boards, don\u2019t let the drill pierce through the top of the trap.",
    "Twist an eye screw into the hole to hang the trap.",
    "Use a screw the same length as the hole you made.",
    "Set the screw end in the hole, then turn it clockwise until it feels tight and sturdy.",
    "You can then hang the trap by threading a rope or a hanging hook through the screw\u2019s eye.",
    "Find space for the trap near your deck or other spots carpenter bees tend to invade.",
    "Hang the trap near where you notice bees or near spots you think they might visit.",
    "With a screw hook, you can hang up a trap just about anywhere.",
    "If you\u2019re not planning on hanging the trap, set it up on a stable surface near where the bees gather.",
    "Put it up high, such as on a table or railing.",
    "Fit the Mason Jar onto the lid to complete the trap.",
    "After hanging up the trap, move the Mason jar toward the lid.",
    "It should fit into the ring holding the lid in place.",
    "Turn the jar counterclockwise until it hangs in place.",
    "When the jar fills with bees, you can unscrew it again to clean it out.",
    "The jar is where the bees go when they want to leave.",
    "The light attracts them there.",
    "It works the same way whether you use a jar, plastic bottles, or another clear material."
