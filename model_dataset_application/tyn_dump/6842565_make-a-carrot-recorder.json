Using a sharp knife, make a cut about 1 inch down from the end with a hole, and about half an inch deep . Be careful not to go any deeper, and gently slice it partially. Move your knife about 1 inch backwards from the previous cut, and cut a wedge out of it, going all the way down to the bottom of the other cut. There should be a triangular hole, and you should be able to see the sides of the carrot. Take the piece you cut off earlier and cut off the very end. This should make the end flat, and rectangular.

Cut it in half from the flat edge so it is a semi-cylindrical piece. It should have 3 flat sides and one curved side. Insert the plug into the hole. Insert it so the flat side faces up towards the cut you made earlier, and the curved part is facing down. If desired, cut away from the edge of the carrot to make a more comfortable mouthpiece. It should resemble the mouthpiece on a recorder, or the reed on a wind instrument. Blow on the mouthpiece. You should now get a whistle. It should sound something like a train whistle. Use a drill bit or knife to cut two holes below the incision made before. You can add more, but two is the ideal (3 tones). Three tones is enough to play simple tunes like Mary Had A Little Lamb, or Hot Cross Buns.",
