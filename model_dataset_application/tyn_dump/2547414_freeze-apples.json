Make sure to evenly coat each slice with the salt water to ensure they stay fresh. The salt acts as a preservative, prolonging the amount of time you can store the apple slices without them going bad or getting freezer burn.

If the apple slices were put in a liquid to sit for a few minutes, pour the bowl of apples into a colander to drain out the liquid.
