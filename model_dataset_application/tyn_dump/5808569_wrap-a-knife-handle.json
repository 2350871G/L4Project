If you're using a more advanced wrap, you'll want a foot of cord for every inch of the knife handle. For example, if your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long, you'll need at least 50 inches (127 cm) of leather stripping for a simple wrap. If your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and you want to use a more advanced wrap, have at least 10 foot (3 m) of cord or leather stripping."

If you're using leather, the strip should be around 3/8 inches (9.52 mm) wide, so you'll have to cut the strip vertically if it's too wide. Having more cord is better than not having enough because you can always cut away the excess cord. If you are cutting a strip of leather from rawhide, you'll have to tan the hide first."

If you're using paracord, the moisture will tighten it as it dries on your knife handle, which makes the wrap tighter.

For example, if your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long, you'll need at least 50 inches (127 cm) of leather stripping for a simple wrap. If your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and you want to use a more advanced wrap, have at least 10 foot (3 m) of cord or leather stripping. Cut your cord or leather stripping.

If you're wrapping your knife handle immediately, you can just start to wrap the knife handle with the wet cord or leather stripping. If you are wrapping your knife handle later, wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to keep it moist. Doing a Simple Wrap Wrap the cord around the knife two times. Holding the cord taut, carefully wrap it around the handle near the blade. Place your thumb on the side of the cord to keep it in place as you wrap. Make another loop under your first loop, making sure that the cord is tight as you work. Place tape around the cord. Take some electrical or grip tape and wrap it around the loops that you created. Wrap the tape tightly so that the cord doesn't move around. Wrap the cord around the knife handle. Start making tight loops around the tape that you laid down. Continue to make tight loops all the way down the handle until you reach the bottom of the handle. As you wrap, make sure that the loops are touching one another. Tie a knot at the bottom of the knife handle. Once you've wrapped your handle, tie a knot at the bottom of your cord to keep the wrapping in place. Cut off the remaining cord and use a lighter to seal the ends. Finish your wrap by cutting away the excess cord with a knife or scissors. Hold a lighter up to the tips of the cord until they start to melt. This will seal off your knife handle wrapping. This method also works as a \"pre-wrap\" that you can do before wrapping your knife handle with a more complex method. Doing a simple preliminary wrap will make more advanced wraps adhere to the handle better. Using a 360 Degree Stryder Wrap Place your knife on top of the center of the cord. Find the center of the cord by folding it over on itself. The middle point is where you'll want to start wrapping the handle. Place your knife on top of the cord so that the cord is close to the blade. Twist both ends of the cord in 180 degrees. Wrap the loose ends of the cord around your index finger and thumb. This will make twisting the cord easier. While still holding the cord in one hand, rotate your wrist so that the cord also wraps over itself. The cord should overlap itself to make an X. Twist the ends of the cord again. Continue to twist in the same direction so that your cord gets twisted again. It should look like a knot near the top of your knife handle at this point. Turn your knife over. Use your finger to keep the fake knot that you created in place while you turn the knife over. You'll have to repeat the process on the other side of the knife. Twist the cord again. Repeat the twisting steps so that there is an identical makeshift knot on the opposite side of the one that you just created. This is what your wrap will look like all the way down the handle. Continue turning the knife over and twisting the cord. Continue down the length of the knife handle, twisting the cord over itself so that there are small makeshift knots running down both sides of the knife handle. Make sure that as you do this the rope or cord is as tight as possible. Continue to do this so that the cord is wrapped closely to itself as you make your way down the handle. Make a knot at the end of the cord. Once you're done wrapping the cord all the way down the handle, you can feed the cord through any pre-drilled holes at the bottom of the knife before tying your knot. If there are no holes, simply tie a knot at the end of your excess cord. This will keep your handle wrap in place. Using a Quick-Release Wrap Create a loop that runs along the back edge of the knife handle. Make a loop at the end of your cord or leather strip and place it on the thin edge of the knife handle. The top of the loop should stop right at the bottom of the blade, and the bottom ends of the loop should run the entire length of the handle. Use your fingers to hold the loop in place. Wrap the long end of the cord around the loop. Use the piece of rope with excess and wrap it around the handle first, then as you come up, wrap it around the loop you just created. The rope will then go back around the handle in the opposite direction that you were wrapping it before. Continue wrapping your cord down the handle. Continue to wrap the cord around the front side of the handle and then around the loop on the backside of the knife. This will create a wrapped braid down the side of your knife. Feed the excess rope at the top of the grip through the loop. When you finally reach the blade of the knife, you'll want to feed the remaining excess rope through, not around, the original loop, that you held in place with your fingers. Cut the top of the rope and seal it with a lighter. Pulling the excess of rope at the bottom of your handle will tighten the wrap. Do this before you seal the excess at the top to make sure that the wrap is tight. Cut off the excess rope or leather strip at the top of your handle and use a lighter to burn the end of the rope. Pull the cord out of the loop at the top to remove the paracord wrapping. To quick release the cord from your knife, all you need to do is pull the cord out of the top loop and pull on the excess rope at the bottom of your knife handle. This will quickly undo the cord if you need to use it for something.",
