Bring the dimensions as well as photos of your countertop\u2019s layout to the retailer where you plan to purchase your tile. Ask for their recommendations in choosing which type of tile will work best for your situation. Once you have purchased your tile, arrange it on your existing countertop to see what it will look like in the end. Confirm that this is the design you wish to go with before you begin. If you are having any of your tiles precut at the store to line the edges, make sure their sizes are correct. If you are looking to create a tiled backsplash on the wall behind the countertop, consider removing the countertop\u2019s backsplash with a reciprocating saw.

Trace the edges of each tile onto the countertop as you go. Then, at the end of each column, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit before you reach the wall or backsplash. Since areas around the sink can be the trickiest, start here to get the tough part over and done with. Along each side of the sink, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit here.

Keep its edge flush along the edge of the counter, sink, or angle, so that it overlaps the last whole tile in that row or column. Place a straightedge over where they meet and trace a cutting line along the tile on top. Then use a wet saw or a tile cutter to cut that tile to size. Once each one is cut, set each tile in its place to make sure it fits. To avoid wasting materials, it\u2019s better to err on the side of not cutting enough on your first try and then trimming off the excess."

Then use a trowel to spread a thin layer over the surface area. Keep the layer thin enough for the outlines on your countertop to show through the adhesive, since you will be following these as you lay out your tiles. One edge of your trowel should be combed. Once you have spread adhesive over the surface area, run the comb over it in one direction to form grooves in the adhesive. If your countertop was rounded, place \u215b\u201d by 2\u201d shims underneath the tiles that will line the sawed-off edges. Then apply mortar the edge of the countertop to ensure that any uneven gaps are filled. This will keep those tiles firmly in place."

As you place each one down, gently push it into the adhesive perpendicular to the combed grooves. For instance, if you combed the adhesive from left to right, push the tile in toward the back of the countertop. After you set each tile down, a tile spacer along each side and corner to create an even line for grout between each pair of tiles. When you reach an area requiring a cut piece of tile, double-check to see if it needs any additional trimming before setting it into place, since the whole tiles may not exactly match your original outline by this time. In areas where appliances have been removed, be careful that no edge pieces project over the original countertop, which may interfere with reinstallation. Once you are done, refer to the adhesive\u2019s directions to find out how long it needs to dry before proceeding."

Once it\u2019s mixed and ready to go, plug all gaps between tiles by packing the grout in with a hard rubber float. Skim any extra off the top and then use your trowel to smooth the surface. Finally, clean the tiles with a wet sponge by:\nWiping each tile in a circular manner, starting from the center of each tile and working your way, to loosen the grout if it has begun to stick. Soaking the sponge again and then wiping the tiles diagonally, being careful to not disturb the grout drying along their sides.

Then, at the end of each column, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit before you reach the wall or backsplash. Since areas around the sink can be the trickiest, start here to get the tough part over and done with. Along each side of the sink, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit here. If the layout of your countertop includes any angles other than right angles, do the same thing as you reach each angle. Cut your tiles to fit. For each area where a whole tile won\u2019t fit in the space left at the end of a row or column, place a whole tile over that area. Keep its edge flush along the edge of the counter, sink, or angle, so that it overlaps the last whole tile in that row or column. Place a straightedge over where they meet and trace a cutting line along the tile on top. Then use a wet saw or a tile cutter to cut that tile to size. Once each one is cut, set each tile in its place to make sure it fits. To avoid wasting materials, it\u2019s better to err on the side of not cutting enough on your first try and then trimming off the excess. Apply adhesive. For tiling, be sure to purchase a latex modified thin-set adhesive. Once your outlines have all been made, remove all loose tiles from the countertop. Then use a trowel to spread a thin layer over the surface area. Keep the layer thin enough for the outlines on your countertop to show through the adhesive, since you will be following these as you lay out your tiles. One edge of your trowel should be combed. Once you have spread adhesive over the surface area, run the comb over it in one direction to form grooves in the adhesive. If your countertop was rounded, place \u215b\u201d by 2\u201d shims underneath the tiles that will line the sawed-off edges. Then apply mortar the edge of the countertop to ensure that any uneven gaps are filled. This will keep those tiles firmly in place. Lay your tiles out. Follow your outlines to set your tiles back into place. Move slowly and purposefully to better ensure that you set them exactly into place. As you place each one down, gently push it into the adhesive perpendicular to the combed grooves. For instance, if you combed the adhesive from left to right, push the tile in toward the back of the countertop. After you set each tile down, a tile spacer along each side and corner to create an even line for grout between each pair of tiles. When you reach an area requiring a cut piece of tile, double-check to see if it needs any additional trimming before setting it into place, since the whole tiles may not exactly match your original outline by this time. In areas where appliances have been removed, be careful that no edge pieces project over the original countertop, which may interfere with reinstallation. Once you are done, refer to the adhesive\u2019s directions to find out how long it needs to dry before proceeding. Grout between the tiles. First, pry the spacers out from between each. Then follow the directions to your grout in order to mix it. Once it\u2019s mixed and ready to go, plug all gaps between tiles by packing the grout in with a hard rubber float. Skim any extra off the top and then use your trowel to smooth the surface. Finally, clean the tiles with a wet sponge by:\nWiping each tile in a circular manner, starting from the center of each tile and working your way, to loosen the grout if it has begun to stick. Soaking the sponge again and then wiping the tiles diagonally, being careful to not disturb the grout drying along their sides. Repeating as needed until the surface of each tile is perfectly clean. Weighing Replacement Options Save money with laminate. If you\u2019re replacing your countertop with a limited budget, go with the cheapest option: laminate. Choose from traditional designs or pick one that resembles more expensive materials, like granite and marble. Opt for a textured surface, rather than a flat one, to better conceal any scratches or other wear and tear that may occur over time. Advantages: takes little effort to wash; stands up to abuse (heavy heat, impact, and stains) very well. Disadvantages: seams allow water to penetrate under the surface and damage the composite wood underneath; surface scratches easily, which is irreparable. Popular colors and patterns for laminate include basalt slate, argento romano, and black riftwood. Use wood for a more natural look. Give your counters a touch of warmth with this earth-toned surface. Price-compare the different types of wood available to find one that matches your budget. Advantages: enhances rustic-style homes; easily repairable; can be utilized for food prep; resists stains when varnished. Disadvantages: requires upkeep with regular applications of mineral oil, beeswax, and varnish; easily damaged by heat and moisture; should not be used over a dishwasher or around sinks. Choose between cherry, maple, teak, walnut, and more. Go the fancy route with marble. If budget is no concern, consider this higher-end countertop. Ensure a sense of style with this classic surface that won\u2019t grow out-of-date. Invest in a surface that will match the rest of your kitchen, regardless of its aesthetic. Advantages: takes little effort to wash when sealed; scratches are repairable with polishing. Disadvantages: easy to chip and scratch; requires sealing on a regular basis; susceptible to etching and staining from acidic foods. Check out various colors of marble to see which pattern and veins you like the most. Minimize maintenance with quartz. If you want to be more or less done with your countertop once you install it, go with this long-lasting material. Enjoy a countertop that will requires little to no upkeep and stand up to almost any abuse, with one exception. Its Achilles heels are the corners and edges, which are prone to chipping. To minimize this, opt for rounded edges. Advantages: non-porous; waterproof; antibacterial; stain- and scratch-resistant; requires no sealant; easy to clean. Disadvantages: can be damaged by heat; corners and edges may chip; difficult to repair. Quartz ranges in color from white and gray to pink, green, or blue. Opt for granite for more affordable durability. If quartz is beyond your budget, or if you are frustrated by the its lack of variety in appearance, consider granite instead. Reap the same benefits with only a little more maintenance required. However, expect the same drawbacks: the edges and corners are its weak spot and are difficult to repair. So opt for a rounded edge to minimize the number of hard corners present. Advantages: stain-, heat-, and scratch-resistant and waterproof when sealed. Disadvantages: requires regular sealing. Black is the most popular color of granite, but it\u2019s also available in beige, blue, burgundy, and other colors. Choose solid surfacing for durability and variety. If you want the benefits of quartz and granite but don\u2019t like the aesthetic of stonework, consider this artificial material. Choose from a wider variety of designs. At the same time, save yourself the trouble of regular maintenance. Advantages: waterproof; nonporous; requires no sealant; heat- and impact-resistant. Disadvantages: prone to scratches, but easily repaired with sanding or buffing. Solid-surface countertops can be made to look like marble, quartz, or granite and is available in a wide range of colors.",
