You can minimize the size of your walls if you follow some of the following tips when possible:\nTry to use small forests because units can't get through forests. Use the nature it will be much easier for you to send your defending troops to the action when there is not much wall. However, your opponent can knock the forest down with a well aimed cannonball, making this strategy ineffective against experienced real players. Don't make the wall far away from your village. If the enemy gets through the wall, it will be difficult to defeat him because he can spread his troops and can cause huge trouble to your villagers etc. So really think about which part of your village needs to be defended and build the wall around this area."

This will help you a lot! If you don't know where your wall goes and how it's built, it's too late when the enemy attacks. You need to be quick but it's very effective for the defense."
