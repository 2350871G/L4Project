In making your selection, you need to think about the specific requirements that must be fulfilled. How harsh is the weather in your location? How big is this window box going to be, and how much weight will the boards have to bear? Every type of wood has unique qualities, and you should keep that in mind as you make your choice. Fairly typical boards for projects of this sort are 1X6s or 2X6s--that is, its dimensions are one inch by six inches or two inches by six inches (the heavier boards may be useful for the bottoms of the box). These come in a number of lengths, so consider which one will be most appropriate for this project. There are a wide variety of grades of pressure-treated lumber that can stand up to outdoor conditions, each designed for specific environments. Learn something about the grades and think about which one will suit your requirements. Though pressure-treated boards are no longer treated with the same toxic chemicals they once were, they are still treated with some peculiar substances. Additionally, new pressure-treated lumber will contain some moisture, and so it cannot be painted until it has begun to dry or weather. For those who would prefer natural woods that are relatively weather resistant without treatment, certain varieties of cedar, cherry, locust, or others may be appropriate."
