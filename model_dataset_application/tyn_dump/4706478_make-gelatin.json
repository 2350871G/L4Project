Stir 2 teaspoons of powdered Agar per into 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Keep stirring with a whisk until the Agar dissolves. At this point, you can sweeten it with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Cook it for 2 minutes, then remove it from heat and pour into some molds, cups, or small bowls.

Agar is made from seaweed. You may also find it labeled as: Agar-Agar, China grass, or kanten. Make panna cotta with cream instead of water. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of gelatin powder over 6tablespoons of cold water and set aside to bloom, about 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 4 cups (1 liter) of heavy cream and \u00bd cup (100 grams) of sugar in a saucepan over a stove. When the sugar dissolves, stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Pour the mixture over the bloomed gelatin, and stir with a spoon to mix. Pour the panna cotta into cups or molds, and let set in the fridge for at least 4 hours. You can also use half-and-half instead of heavy cream. This will give you a lighter panna cotta. Keep in mind that gelatin made with dairy may take longer to set. Make fruit-flavored gelatin by using fruit juice instead of water. Pour two packets of unflavored gelatin over 1 cup (225 milliliters) of juice. Boil 3 cups (675 milliliters) of juice, then pour it over the gelatin-juice. Stir until the gelatin is dissolved and everything is combined. Pour the gelatin into molds. You can also use cups or small bowls. Refrigerate for about 4 hours, or until the gelatin becomes firm. Make lemon-flavored dessert gelatin. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of gelatin over \u00bd cup (112.50 milliliters) of cold water and set aside to bloom. Dissolve 1/3 cup (75 grams) sugar in 1 cup (225 milliliters) of hot water. Add in the bloomed gelatin and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Stir until everything has dissolved. Pour into molds and leave in refrigerator until it sets. Consider adding fruit.

Let each layer of gelatin almost set before adding the next layer. You want the consistency to be soft and gel-like. If you add the layers too late, they won't stick together.
