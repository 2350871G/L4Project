You can either mount your blinds on the inside or on the outside of the casing. If you hang your blinds on the outside, your window (and the blinds) will look larger. Hanging the blinds on the inside gives your window a slimmer look. Inside mounts also allow more light to shine around the edges of the blinds. Measuring for an outside mount: Measure along the outside edges of the casing that surrounds the window. Measure the exact length from the top of the casing to the bottom of the casing (or to the sill if your window has one). Measuring for an inside mount: Put your measuring tape inside the casing where the glass of the window meets the casing. Measure the width of the window at the top, middle and bottom. If there is any difference in the numbers, use the smallest figure to base your measurements off of."

For an inside mount: Place the head rail inside the casing. It should be level--keep your handrail level, even if your window is not. Make pencil marks below the head rail on each end. Attaching the Brackets Open the bracket door and hold the end brackets in place. Place them inside the pencil marks you have made. There are two open sides to the bracket--one of them should face out towards you, while the other should face in towards the center of the window. The bracket door must face towards the inside of the room. If your bracket door is tricky to use, consider trying to open it with one of your fingers and a screwdriver. Mark where you will be  drilling. Using your pencil, mark the spots where you will need to drill your pilot holes (there should be two of them).

For an outside mount: The brackets should be placed on the outside face of the window casing on both sides of the window.

Installing the Head Rail and Valance Snap the valance clips in place. Valance clips are used to attach the head rail to the valance.

Place the valance along the head rail in the position you would like it to be in. Rest it on top of the valance clips. When you have positioned it the way you would like it be, press gently down so that the valance clips snap into the valance, holding it in place. Secure the blind wand. If your blinds came with a wand for opening and closing them, and it did not come pre-attached, attach it now.
