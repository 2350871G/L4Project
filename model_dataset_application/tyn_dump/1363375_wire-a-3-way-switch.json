Most circuit breakers are located in the garage or basement, but placement will vary from home to home. When you find the breaker box, locate the breaker that controls the lights for the room you are working on. Flip it to the off position to keep power from traveling down those wires. Most electrical panels label switches for the different rooms in your home. Use a voltage tester to check that power is no longer flowing to that room."

Attach the wire to the black common screw on the switch.Make sure you don\u2019t attach the traveler wires to the common screw, or else the switches won\u2019t work properly. Cap the white neutral wires to each switch box. Place a plastic cap on the end of the white wire from the top conductor in the new switch location. Take the neutrals from the other end of the top conductor, the power source, and the light and cap them in the original switch location.

If there isn\u2019t a neutral wire in the switch box, you have to run one from another location before installing the smart switch. Connect the traveler wires using the bottom conductor.
