          "description":"Use a screwdriver that\u2019s small enough to fit in the screws holding the metal pieces in place. Turn the screws counterclockwise until they\u2019re loose and pull them out of the box. Set the screws in a small dish so you don\u2019t misplace or lose them while you\u2019re working. You do not have to remove the hinges and clasp from the box if you want to paint them the same color as the wood. If your box doesn\u2019t have any hinges or clasps, you may skip this step."

        {
          "headline":"Smooth the surface of the box with 180\u2013220-grit sandpaper.",
          "description":"Fold a piece of 180- or 220-grit sandpaper in half so it\u2019s easier to hold and rub it over the surfaces of the box. Use small circular motions across the flat surfaces and apply firm pressure to smooth out any raised areas so the paint can adhere to the wood easier. Blow any sawdust off the wood\u2019s surface as you work so you see the areas that you already smoothed out. Be careful as you work around the corners or edges since you could make them rounded and affect how well the box closes. Avoid using lower grit sandpaper since you could leave scratches or marks on the surface that become more noticeable after you paint the box."

          "headline":"Choose and mix the paint color you want to use for your box.",
          "description":"Opt for an acrylic paint if you want the box to have a semi-glossy appearance. If you\u2019d rather have a matte finish, select a farmhouse paint, which is a type of chalk paint. Open the paint and stir it thoroughly to ensure the color spreads through it evenly. You can buy farmhouse or acrylic paints from your local craft store. Avoid using oil paints since they take a long time to dry."

          "description":"Put a thin layer of paint on the end of a natural-bristle or foam paintbrush and spread it evenly over the wood. Work on the outside surfaces of the box first, using long, straight strokes so the brush lines aren\u2019t as visible while you\u2019re working. After painting the exterior of the box, let it dry for 15\u201320 minutes. You do not have to use a primer on the box before you start painting it."

          "headline":"Paint 1\u20132 more coats on the box if you want a more solid color.",
          "description":"Paint the next coat of paint in the opposite direction as the first one to help hide the brush strokes more. Make sure each layer has the same thickness so it dries evenly. Allow each coat of paint to dry for at least 15\u201320 minutes before you apply the next one. For example, if you painted horizontally across the box for the first coat, then paint them vertically on the second coat. Additional layers of paint will make the color stand out more and ensure the wood grain doesn\u2019t show through to the final piece."

          "description":"If you took off the hinges and clasp, set the lid upside-down while you\u2019re working. Otherwise, leave the box open on the hinges. Paint around each of the edges and the interior of the box with a thin layer of acrylic or farmhouse paint. Allow the coat to dry for at least 15\u201320 minutes before applying the next coat. Use 2\u20133 coats total on the inside of the box. You do not need to paint the inside of the box if you don\u2019t want to. Try using a different color of paint if you want the inside of the box to add an accent. For example, you may paint the outside of the box white and the interior a metallic gold color."

        {
          "headline":"Use a paint marker if you want to draw intricate designs.",
          "description":"Shake the paint marker thoroughly so the paint evenly spreads inside. Remove the cap from the marker and draw any designs you want. You may try writing names, making letters, or adding detailed line work as decoration. Make sure to put the cap back on the marker when you\u2019re finished using it so it doesn\u2019t dry out. You can buy paint markers from your local craft store. Experiment using the paint markers on a scrap piece of wood or paper before using them on your box to ensure they\u2019re the color you want.Tip: Trace around stencils if you want to add decorative elements to your design. For example, use a hole punch to make a polka-dot pattern on a piece of paper or cardstock, and color in spots with your marker."

          "description":"Use a piece of 180- or 220-grit sandpaper and apply light pressure around the sharp edges of the box to lift up the paint. Press slightly harder if you want to remove more paint and expose some of the natural wood underneath it. Try to focus around areas that would naturally distress over time, such as around the hinges or clasp. You do not have to distress the wood if you want your painted box to have a clean, finished look."

          "headline":"Apply 2 coats of varnish to protect the painted surface.",
          "description":"Stir the varnish slowly so it doesn\u2019t develop any bubbles before using it. Dip the ends of a natural bristle paintbrush in the varnish and pull it in long, straight lines across the surfaces of the box. Drag the tip of the brush over the areas you\u2019ve gone over to help smooth it out. Allow the varnish to dry for about 4 hours until it\u2019s no longer tacky. Then apply a second coat. If there are bumps or uneven surfaces, lightly sand the varnish smooth with 220-grit sandpaper. You can choose glossy or matte varnish depending on how much you want the box to shine. Varnish can create harmful fumes, so be sure to work in a well-ventilated area to avoid any irritation."

Lift the tool up frequently and blow away any sawdust so you can see where you\u2019re working. Keep working around the outline until you\u2019ve carved out the entire outline. Dremel rotary tools have small spinning heads that make them easy to work with for carving designs into wood. You can buy them from your local hardware store. You may also hold the tool sideways so the wider end presses against the wood if you want to make larger recessed areas in the wood. You can carve into the wood as deep as you want, but be careful not to punch through to the inside of the box. Never touch the rotating head while the Dremel tool is on since you could seriously injure yourself. Sand any rough edges with 180-grit sandpaper. Go around your design and apply light pressure with the sandpaper to remove any raised or rough areas. Work in short back and forth motions so you don\u2019t ruin the carved design. Blow away the sawdust while you\u2019re working so you can clearly see which areas you\u2019ve already sanded. If there are still rough edges, try using 220-grit sandpaper to smooth it out more. Rub wood stain onto the box with a rag or shop cloth. Choose the color stain you want for your box, and dip the end of a rag or shop cloth in it. Rub the stain onto the wood following the direction of the grain so it absorbs the best. Keep applying the stain until you coat the entire surface of the wood so it has a uniform color. Allow the stain to dry for about 4 hours. The stain will usually look darker in engraved areas, which will help your design look more prominent. Seal the box with polyurethane wood finish to seal the stain. Mix the wood finish with a stir stick slowly so it doesn\u2019t form any bubbles. Dip the end of a natural-bristle brush into the finish and wipe off any excess. Use long, straight strokes across the surface of the wood, making sure to apply a thin and even layer. Smooth out the finish with the tips of the bristles before letting it dry for 4 hours. You can apply a second layer of wood finish if you want additional protection. Wood finish creates harmful fumes, so work in a well-ventilated area while using it.",
