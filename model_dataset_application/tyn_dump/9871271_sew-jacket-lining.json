          "description":"The lining of the jacket will not be visible most of the time, but it will occasionally peek through. Therefore, you will most likely want to choose a lining fabric that will go well with the outer fabric of the jacket. For example, if you are making a dark brown jacket, then you will most likely want to use another earth tone, such as medium brown, beige, or tan. For a more striking look, try choosing a lining in a contrasting color, such as a red lining for a white jacket or a lime green lining for a hot pink jacket."

          "description":"The lining fabric should be smooth so that it will easily glide over other clothing when the wearer puts the jacket on and takes it off. You can tell if a fabric will make good lining material by touching it and running it across your clothing. If the fabric feels smooth and glides easily over your clothes, then it will likely make a good lining. Fabrics that make good linings include silk, satin, and acetate. Avoid rough fabrics, such as flannel, wool, and fleece."

          "headline":"Check the care instructions for the fabric.",
          "description":"The lining fabric should require the same type of care as the fabric for your jacket. Otherwise, it may be difficult to clean the garment. Check the lining fabric\u2019s care instructions and compare them to the care instructions for the jacket\u2019s outer fabric. For example, if the lining fabric is dry clean only and the outer fabric of the jacket is machine washable, then the entire jacket would need to be dry cleaned each time it is dirty."

          "headline":"See how well the fabric moves.",
          "description":"Lining fabric should be relatively flexible so that it will move with the garment, rather than bunching up or making the jacket feel stiff. Try moving the fabric to see how easily is moves, such as by waving it in the air and folding it in your hands. If the fabric feels stiff, then it probably won\u2019t make a very good lining. Avoid heavyweight fabrics, such as wool and linen, which tend to be thicker and less flexible than lightweight fabrics, such as cotton and silk."

However, if the pattern does not include this information, then you can use a simple formula to figure out how much fabric to get. Add together the total length of the front and back of the jacket and the sleeve length. For example, if your jacket pattern will create a jacket that is 30 inches (76 cm) long in the front and back, and it will have sleeves that are 26 inches (66 cm) long, then add 30 + 30 +26 for a total of 86 inches (220 cm)."

Consider whether or not the lining fabric will shrink the first time it is washed. If it will, then you should preshrink it by washing the fabric as indicated for that type of fabric. For example, cotton will most likely shrink the first time you wash it, so you should definitely wash cotton fabric. Keep in mind that any fabrics that are dry clean only will not require any pretreatment, such as wool and silk."

If your fabric is wrinkled, then iron it on a low setting. For delicate fabrics, place a t-shirt or towel over the fabric before you iron it."

If your pattern does not include these kinds of instructions, use the pattern for your jacket to cut out the lining pieces. Fold the lining fabric in half and then lay the pattern pieces over the fabric. Pin the pattern pieces to the lining fabric along the edges of the pattern pieces. Then, cut the lining fabric along the outside of the pattern pieces. Be sure to check the pattern pieces for instructions on how to position them on the fabric. For example, some pieces will need to be positioned along a fold, while others are fine to place anywhere on the fabric. You will also need to consider your fabric\u2019s grainline, and cut out any darts or notches indicated by the pattern."
