          "description":"If you'd prefer a box with a more subtle, solid color, try spray painting it. Holding the paint can about 8 inches (20 cm) away from the box, spray a light and even coat on the surface. Give the box 2-3 spray paint coats, letting it dry for 30-60 minutes between applications. If you spray paint your box, do so before you place the chocolates inside. Wait for the paint to dry and seal the chocolates inside a plastic bag to prevent paint from touching them. Using glitter spray paint can give the box vibrancy without compromising its simpler design."
