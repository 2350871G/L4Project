While the concrete or post mix is still wet, use the spirit level to make sure each fence post is completely vertical. Make any adjustments if necessary. Leave the concrete or post mix to dry completely. Concrete may take up to 48 hours to dry. Attaching the Fence Check that the posts are level. Lay a piece of timber across the tops of two consecutive fence posts and use a bubble level to check that the tops are level. If they are not, cut the tops of the posts to the correct height using a circular saw, chain saw, reciprocating saw, or hand saw. Attach the fence panels. To attach the fence panels to the posts, you can either use rust resistant nails or exterior-grade brackets and screws. Using nails: Position each fence panel between two posts so that the edges of the panels reach the center of the posts. Use a spirit level across the top supporting rail to ensure the fence panel is level. Use 18d or 20d galvanized nails to attach the panel to the posts, through the top and bottom supporting rails.

    "For best results (but a higher cost), buy pressure-treated posts that have been injected with water repellent.",
    "You can also buy water repellent stains and apply a few coats to the end of the post.",
