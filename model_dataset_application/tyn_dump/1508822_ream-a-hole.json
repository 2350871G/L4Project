A hand reamer will have a square shank and depending on the size of the reamer, you\u2019ll fit the shank into either a tap wrench or crescent wrench to turn it. A hand reamer allows for great accuracy after considerable practice."

          "headline":"Drill the hole.",
          "description":"Because a reamer is an enlarging tool and not a cutting tool, you must drill out the hole with a standard drill bit before reaming it. You want to use a drill bit approximately 0.016\u201d smaller than your reamer to ensure that you don\u2019t oversize the hole. For instance, if you know that you need to ream your hole to 1/2\u201d, then you\u2019d want to drill the hole first with a 31/64\u201d drill bit. Drilling a hole too small and leaving too much material left for the reamer to clear can lead to the reamer deflecting off the material, which is called chatter. Chatter leads to poor finishes and can also damage your reamer."
