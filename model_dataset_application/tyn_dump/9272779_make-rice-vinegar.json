Place the rice, along with any leftover cooking water, in an airtight glass or stoneware bottle or jar.

If you have homemade rice vinegar that hasn\u2019t been filtered, you can scoop the Mother off the top and add 1 to 2 fluid ounces (30 to 59 ml) of it to the rice. If you don\u2019t have Mother Vinegar, add the same amount of rice wine to the rice instead. Making the vinegar with wine takes longer, but the process is still effective. You can purchase Mother Vinegar from a variety of online retailers. Shaoxing rice wine is a good option for making rice wine vinegar. You can usually find it at Asian markets."

Fresh vinegar should be stored in the fridge. It will keep for 3 to 4 months. If you want the vinegar to last longer and to be able to store it at room temperature, you should pasteurize it. Bring the vinegar to a temperature of 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) in a pan, and allow it to maintain the temperature for 10 minutes. It\u2019s usually easiest to do it in a slow cooker set on low for 1 to 2 hours. Pasteurized vinegar will last for years, if not indefinitely."
