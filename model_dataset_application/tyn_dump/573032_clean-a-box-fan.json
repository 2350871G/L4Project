When the dust and dirt comes off easily with a rinse, the covers are finished soaking. An alternative method is dousing the covers down with some vinegar. If you have a hose outside, use that to hose off your covers. The dirt will come right off. It\u2019s slightly harder to clean the covers by hand, but it can be done that way as well. Spray the covers with equal parts water and vinegar, and then wipe the dirt away with a towel."

Instead, apply it to the cloth and then wipe the blades with the dampened cloth. Apply pulling pressure to the blade set and remove it if needed. Use a vacuum with the hose attachment to vacuum out the motor vents. You can also use mild dish soap mixed with water and use a q-tip to help you clean out hard to reach areas. Take care not to get any water or cleaning agents in the motor, however, since this can cause damage. Gently wipe down all plastic parts, like the outside of the fan, its carrying handle, and its knobs, with a damp cloth."
