The hula hoops should be positioned so that there is little to no space between the hoops. If you're playing this game inside on hard floor, use masking tape to create your human tic tac toe board. On cement, you can draw the board with chalk. Check for holes, dangerous garbage (like broken glass), and other hazards, like roots or rocks, to prevent these from causing an injury while you play. If you're playing this game with many people, you might want to set up several game boards. This game works best with one to three players per team."
