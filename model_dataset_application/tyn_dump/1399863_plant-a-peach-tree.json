If you do end up purchasing a young tree, look for a dormant one with few to no leaves. These are best purchased between fall and early spring. If you try to plant an active tree with green leaves and full branches, it may put too much strain on the tree, and it is likelier that the tree will fail. As for using a peach seed, make sure it comes from a delicious, juicy peach, so your future peaches have the traits of \u201ctheir mother\u201d (although you should keep in mind that there is no guarantee that it will share these traits). When you find a tasty peach, set out the pit to dry for a few days. When it\u2019s brittle, crack it open to reveal the seeds \u2013 they\u2019ll look like almonds."
