Since the onions will continue cooking alongside the other vegetables, you should not allow them to brown yet. If the onions start to look brown before the designated amount of time has passed, quickly move onto the next step."

Cook, still covered, for 5 more minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Alternatively, if you prefer your vegetables to be a little more tender, you can cook the dish for a longer period of time. Test the vegetables every few minutes for tenderness by piercing them with a fork. If you do decide to cook the vegetables for more than 5 minutes, stir the contents of the pan after the first 5 minutes and whenever you check on the vegetables."

Bean sprouts do not take long to cook, and if you leave them in for too long, they can become mushy and unappetizing.
