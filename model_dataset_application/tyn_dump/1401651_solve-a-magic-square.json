Solving a Singly Even Magic Square Understand what a singly even square is. Everyone knows that an even number is divisible by 2, but in magic squares, there are different methodologies for solving singly and doubly even squares. A singly even square has a number of boxes per side that is divisible by 2, but not 4. The smallest possible singly even magic square is 6x6, since 2x2 magic squares can\u2019t be made. Calculate the magic constant. Use the same method as you would with odd magic squares: the magic constant = [n * (n^2 + 1)] / 2, where n = the number of boxes per side. So, in the example of a 6x6 square:\nsum = [6 * (62 + 1)] / 2\nsum = [6 * (36 + 1)] / 2\nsum = (6 * 37) / 2\nsum = 222 / 2\nThe magic constant for a 6x6 square is 222/2, or 111. All rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to this number. Divide the magic square into four quadrants of equal size. Label them A (top left), C (top right), D (bottom left) and B (bottom right). To figure out how large each square should be, simply divide the number of boxes in each row or column by half. So, for a 6x6 square, each quadrant would be 3x3 boxes. Assign each quadrant a number range. Quadrant A gets for the quarter of numbers; Quadrant B the second quarter; Quadrant C the third quarter, and Quadrant D the final quarter of the total number range for the 6x6 magic square. In the example of a 6x6 square, Quadrant A would be solved with the numbers from 1-9; Quadrant B with 10-18; Quadrant C with 19-27; and Quadrant D with 28-36.

Highlight A-1, A-2, and A-3 together comprise Highlight A.\nRepeat this process in Quadrant D, creating an identical highlighted area called Highlight D. Swap Highlights A and D. This is a one-to-one swap; simply lift and replace the boxes between Quadrant A and Quadrant D without changing their order at all. Once you\u2019ve done this, all the rows, columns, and diagonals in your magic square should add up to the magic constant you calculated. Do an additional swap for singly even magic squares larger than 6x6. In addition to the swap for quadrants A & D mentioned above, you also need to do a swap for quadrants C & B.

    "Highlight A-3 is a box identical to A-1, but placed in the bottom left corner of the quadrant.",
    "Highlight A-1, A-2, and A-3 together comprise Highlight A.\nRepeat this process in Quadrant D, creating an identical highlighted area called Highlight D. Swap Highlights A and D. This is a one-to-one swap; simply lift and replace the boxes between Quadrant A and Quadrant D without changing their order at all.",
    "Once you\u2019ve done this, all the rows, columns, and diagonals in your magic square should add up to the magic constant you calculated.",
    "Do an additional swap for singly even magic squares larger than 6x6.",
    "In addition to the swap for quadrants A & D mentioned above, you also need to do a swap for quadrants C & B.",
    "Highlight columns from the right side of the square toward the left one less than the number of columns highlighted for highlight A-1.",
    "Swap the values in quadrant C with the values in quadrant B for those columns, using the same one-to-one method.",
    "Here are two images of a 14x14 Magic Square before and after doing both swaps.",
    "Quadrant A swap area is highlighted blue, Quadrant D swap area is highlighted green, Quadrant C swap area is highlighted yellow, and Quadrant B swap area is highlighted orange.",
    "14x14 Magic Square before making swaps (steps 6, 7, & 8)\n14x14 Magic Square after making swaps (steps 6, 7, & 8) Solving a Doubly Even Magic Square Understand what a doubly even square is.",
    "A singly even square has a number of boxes per side that\u2019s divisible by 2.",
    "A doubly even square has a number of boxes per side divisible by double that \u2014 4.",
    "The smallest doubly-even box that can be made is a 4x4 square.",
    "Calculate the magic constant.",
    "Use the same method as you would with odd-numbered or singly-even magic squares: the magic constant = [n * (n^2 + 1)] / 2, where n = the number of boxes per side.",
    "So, in the example of a 4x4 square:\nsum = [4 * (4^2 + 1)] / 2\nsum = [4 * (16 + 1)] / 2\nsum = (4 * 17) / 2\nsum = 68 / 2\nThe magic constant for a 4x4 square is 68/2, or 34.",
    "All rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to this number.",
    "Create Highlights A-D.",
    "In each corner of the magic square, mark a mini-square with sides a length of n/4, where n = the length of a side of the whole magic square.",
    "Label them Highlights A, B, C, and D in a counter-clockwise manner.",
    "In a 4x4 square, you would simply mark the four corner boxes.",
    "In an 8x8 square, each Highlight would be a 2x2 area in the corners.",
    "In a 12x12 square, each Highlight would be a 3x3 area in the corners, and so on.",
    "Create the Central Highlight.",
    "Mark all the boxes in the center of the magic square in a square area of length n/2, where n = the length of a side of the whole magic square.",
    "The Central Highlight should not overlap with Highlights A-D at all, but touch each of them at the corners.",
    "In a 4x4 square, the Central Highlight would be a 2x2 area in the center.",
    "In an 8x8 square, the Central Highlight would be a 4x4 area in the center, and so on.",
    "Fill in the magic square, but only in Highlighted areas.",
    "Begin filling in the numbers of your magic square from left to right, but only write in the number if the box falls into a Highlight.",
    "So, in a 4x4 box, you would fill in the following boxes:\n1 in the top-left box and 4 in the top-right box\n6 and 7 in the center boxes in Row 2\n10 and 11 in the center boxes in Row 3\n13 in the bottom-left box and 16 in the bottom-right box.",
    "Fill in the rest of the magic square by counting backwards.",
    "The is essentially the inverse of the previous step.",
    "Begin again with the top left box, but this time, skip all boxes that fall in Highlighted area, and fill in non-higlighted boxes by counting backwards.",
    "Begin with the largest number in your number range.",
    "So, in a 4x4 magic square, you would fill in the following:\n15 and 14 in the center boxes in Row 1\n12 in the left-most box and 9 in the right-most box in Row 2\n8 in the left-most box and 5 in the right-most box in Row 3\n3 and 2 in the center boxes in Row 4\nAt this point, all your columns, rows, and diagonals should up to your magic constant you calculated."
