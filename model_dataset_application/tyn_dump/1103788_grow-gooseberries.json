You will need to keep your bare-root clippings cool and moist if not planted immediately, and they will need to be soaked in water for about 4 hours before planting. Wrap the root in a moist paper towel, place the root in a cup or glass, and set in the fridge until you are ready to plant.

Take a shovel and loosen the soil to a depth equivalent to the height of the rootball, which is the mass of roots under the stem, and over a wide area to prevent compaction and improve drainage. If you have bare root clippings they will not have a root ball. Instead, loosen the soil around a depth of 3 inches. If your plot becomes waterlogged over the winter, simply loosen the soil again and plant your clippings on a slight mound, approximately 3-4 inches high."
