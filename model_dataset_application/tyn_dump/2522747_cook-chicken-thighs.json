For instance, you could make a simple sauce with 1/2 cup (125 ml) chicken broth, 3 Tbsp (45 ml) butter, and 2 Tbsp (60 ml) lemon juice. Pour the sauce over the chicken thighs and stir to coat them. Use a large metal spoon to stir the chicken thighs to fully coat them in the sauce. Ensure that every piece of chicken is fully covered in the sauce. Cook the chicken thighs on low for 5 to 6 hours. When the chicken is finished cooking, it should have an internal temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). It should also be tender enough that you can easily pull it apart with a fork. Tip: If you want the chicken sooner than 5-6 hours, cook it on high heat for 2-3 hours. Just make sure to check the temperature of the meat before you eat it. Serve the chicken while it is still warm. When the chicken has finished cooking, turn the slow cooker down to warm. You may serve it right out of the slow cooker or remove the chicken from the slow cooker and place it on a serving platter. Fried Chicken Thighs Place the chicken thighs in a glass baking pan or dish and season them. Sprinkle the chicken thighs with 1/4 tsp (1.25 g) of salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 g) of black pepper, and then pour the 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of buttermilk over them. Marinate the chicken in the buttermilk for at least 2 hours. You may marinate the chicken overnight if desired.Warning: Buttermilk can react with metal, so if you don\u2019t have a glass bowl or pan to use, use something that\u2019s made from ceramic or plastic instead. Heat the oil if you\u2019re using a deep-fryer. When you are ready to cook the chicken thighs, pour the oil into your deep fryer and heat the oil to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Use an instant-read candy thermometer to check the temperature if your deep fryer does not have temperature gauge. A deep-fryer works best, but in a pinch, you could also use thick metal stockpot with tall sides. Heat the oil in the stockpot over medium-high heat. Arrange your breading ingredients in separate bowls. Place the flour, beaten eggs, and cornmeal into bowls. Use bowls that are wide and shallow to make dipping and coating the chicken thighs easier. If desired, you may also season the cornmeal with a dash of salt, pepper, and paprika. Dunk each thigh into the flour, egg, and cornmeal in that order. Remove the thigh from the buttermilk and allow excess buttermilk to drip off over the bowl. Cake both sides of the thigh with flour and tap it lightly against the side of the bowl to remove the excess flour. Then, dunk the floured chicken into the egg wash. Allow any excess egg to drip off by holding the thigh above the bowl. Dredge all sides of the thigh in the cornmeal last. Repeat this for each of the chicken thighs. Place the coated thighs on a clean baking pan or plate as you go. Fry each piece for 13 to 20 minutes if using oil. Carefully lower the pieces of chicken into the deep fryer The chicken should be golden brown when it is finished, and the internal temperature should reach 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). Cook the chicken at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for 18-20 minutes if air-frying. Preheat the air fryer to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and then remove the basket. Lightly mist the bottom of the basket with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil. Then, arrange the chicken thighs on the basket in a single layer. Lightly mist the chicken thighs with nonstick cooking spray or olive oil. Return the basket to the air fryer, and cook the chicken thighs for 10 minutes, turn them, mist them with cooking spray or olive oil again, and continue cooking until the time is up.Misting the chicken thighs with oil will help to provide a crispy outer texture without adding fat to them. Drain the chicken thighs on paper towels and serve them. If you deep friend the chicken thighs, let them rest on a plate covered in paper towels for 5 minutes to drain any excess oil. Serve the chicken while it is still hot. Broiled Chicken Thighs Preheat the broiler for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the oven dial to the broil setting or press the broil button if your oven has digital controls. Most broilers only have one setting. If yours has separate \"low\" and \"high\" settings, though, use the \"high\" setting. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper as desired, and then evenly brush or drizzle 1 to 2 US tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of olive oil over the chicken. Use approximately 1/4 tsp (1.25 g) of salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 g) of black pepper if you do not have an established preference. You can also toss the chicken thighs in the salt, pepper, and oil if desired. Tip: Try adding a combination of other seasonings to the salt, pepper, and oil if you want a different flavor, such as 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, or 1 teaspoon (5 g) of thyme with 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic. Place the chicken thighs in a broiler pan. Make sure that there is space between the rack inside the pan and the bottom of the pan. You may want to use a broiler pan with a rack inside to allow air to circulate around the chicken, but a regular baking pan or a cast iron pan is also acceptable. The rack inside a broiler pan also keeps the meat out of the hot fat and oil that drips off the chicken, which can help to reduce the fat in the dish. It doesn't matter which side faces up when using boneless skinless thighs. If you use bone-in thighs, however, make sure that the bone side faces up. If you're cooking chicken with the skin, it often tastes better to put the skin side up, so that it can get crisp. Place the broiler pan 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) under the heating element. Most broilers are set up so that the pan will be about this distance from the heating element. Set the broiler pan on center of the rack.If your oven requires adjusting a rack, do this while the oven is still cold. Check for markings in the over or measure from the rack to the heating element to find the correct distance. Broil the chicken thighs for a total of 20 minutes. If desired, you may turn them over after 10 minutes to ensure even browning, but this is only recommended if they are skinless. Leave the chicken thighs uncovered while they broil. Thick thighs or bone-in thighs may need to be cooked for a total of 25 to 35 minutes, instead. Check for an internal temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). Stick the thermometer into the thickest part of the largest piece. If you\u2019re using bone-in thighs, make sure that the thermometer does not touch the bone. Pull the chicken out of the oven once the chicken thighs are thoroughly browned and at an internal temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). As a rule of thumb, the juices should also run clear and the meat should no longer be pink.",
