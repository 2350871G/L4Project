First, fill the water reservoir before plugging it in to avoid any mishaps or electrical shocks. Next, plug it in and select your desired settings. Give it a couple minutes to heat the water. Always keep it sitting on its heel, rather than flat on a surface, to avoid scorching the surface. Once you're ready to begin pressing your pants, keep this in mind:\nWhen pressing pants, all you need to do with the iron is gently press downward for a second or two and give the fabric a squirt of steam as you do so, with none of the back-and-forth movement that comes with regular ironing."
