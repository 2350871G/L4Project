Miniature roses that only reach heights of 6\u201318 inches (15\u201346 cm) may only require a container that\u2019s 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) deep, whereas larger specimens will need at least 18 inches (46 cm) in order for their roots to spread out comfortably. Box planters, wooden barrels, and washtubs can make great containers for full-sized roses. When it doubt, it\u2019s better to go too big than too small. Roses that are planted in roomy containers grow larger and healthier on average, and also tend to do better over the harsh winter season."

By fitting a heavy stone-type container with a separate plastic liner, you can ensure that your planting soil stays cool and retains vital moisture. Roses that get too hot need more frequent watering, which can be hard on both you and the plant. Most garden supply stores and greenhouses sell plastic pot liners that are designed to fit perfectly inside standard-sized containers. If you don\u2019t want to purchase a separate liner, you can also make your own using a plastic trash bag or several layers of newsprint."

If you already have a container you want to use that doesn\u2019t feature built-in drainage holes, you can put a few in yourself using an electric drill. Your roses can develop many undesirable conditions as a result of overwatering, including stunted growth, wilting, and root rot, which can actually kill the plant."

A gravel or stone base will help promote proper drainage and prevent the soil at the bottom of the container from becoming too compacted. Sand or clay particles can also be used to give the lower part of the soil a well-drained, loamy texture.

Avoid filling the container all the way to the top\u2014if the soil is too heavy, your roses may have trouble breathing. Look for mixtures that are specifically formulated for use with roses.

The top of the soil should be about even with the bud onion (the bulbous, woody stalk at the base of the plant from which the stems will sprout), so that the roots are submerged by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm). Be sure to pack the soil firmly enough to anchor the rose, but not enough to smother or constrict it. Plant your rose at about the same level it was at in the pot or container. You will want a pot that is deep enough to fit your root ball and still leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the soil and the top. This helps prevent spilling when watering."

Once in place, it will act as a support structure for the rose to cling to as it grows. Sink the stake as deep as possible to make sure it's secure. Ideally, it should reach all the way down to the bottom of the container. When raising an entire bush in a barrel, washtub, or grow bag, it\u2019s a good idea to put down multiple stakes 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) apart. If you attempt to grow larger types of roses without the aid of a separate support structure, they\u2019ll eventually droop and spill out over the sides of the container."

These provide rose bushes with most of the nutrients they need to grow. To be on the safe side, always apply fertilizer soon after watering, and only use about half the amount recommended on the product packaging. Overfeeding your roses can burn the delicate roots, especially when they\u2019re dry. Once the flowers begin blooming, you can increase the frequency of your applications to once every 1-2 weeks.

Get in the habit of pruning your roses back in the spring before they start blooming. Selective pruning can also be used to shape the plant to better fit a particular space. Always prune above an outward-facing bud to prevent inward growth."

To prevent an established rose from becoming rootbound, simply loosen the soil around the edges of the old container, lift out the entire plant, and transfer it to its new home. Be sure to fill the new container with fresh potting soil and organic material. It\u2019s especially important to repot roses if you\u2019ve noticed their growth stalling, or they appear sickly despite having their needs met."

    "To be on the safe side, always apply fertilizer soon after watering, and only use about half the amount recommended on the product packaging.",
    "Overfeeding your roses can burn the delicate roots, especially when they\u2019re dry.",
    "Once the flowers begin blooming, you can increase the frequency of your applications to once every 1-2 weeks.",
    "Roses grown outdoors will need to be fertilized more often than those grown indoors because of how much faster they develop.",
    "Space your individual containers 2 feet (0.61 m) apart.",
    "Leaving a little room between each container will increase the airflow around your roses, allowing them to take in more beneficial gases from the surrounding atmosphere.",
    "It can also help prevent the spread of fungal diseases by keeping affected foliage from coming into contact with healthy plants.",
    "In addition to preserving the health of your roses, spacing your containers strategically makes it possible to display them over a much wider area.",
    "Deadhead dead or dying blooms to make room for new growth.",
    "Inspect your roses periodically to look for dead or fading blooms.",
    "When you find them, clip the stem down to the first set of five leaflets using a pair of sharp pruning shears.",
    "Removing dead blooms will encourage healthy new flowers to return in their place.",
    "Get in the habit of pruning your roses back in the spring before they start blooming.",
    "Selective pruning can also be used to shape the plant to better fit a particular space.",
    "Always prune above an outward-facing bud to prevent inward growth.",
    "Repot your roses every 3 years.",
    "When roses outgrow a small container, they can become rootbound, which means there\u2019s no longer enough room for their roots to continue spreading.",
    "To prevent an established rose from becoming rootbound, simply loosen the soil around the edges of the old container, lift out the entire plant, and transfer it to its new home.",
    "Be sure to fill the new container with fresh potting soil and organic material.",
    "It\u2019s especially important to repot roses if you\u2019ve noticed their growth stalling, or they appear sickly despite having their needs met."
