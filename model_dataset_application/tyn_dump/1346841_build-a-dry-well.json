    "Connect your drain pipe to the tank.",
    "You have a few options when it comes to how you connect the pipe to the tank.",
    "You can use a PVC elbow and an adapting piece to glue pipes together and slide it into the top of the drain tank.",
    "If you want a looser connection, use PVC glue to add a flexible pipe to the last length of your pipe.",
    "Fit it over the hole to your drain tank and wrap a worm drive around the connection before pulling the adjustable tab to tighten it.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to connect the pipe, you can run the PVC pipe right over the opening for you tank.",
    "If you\u2019re using a bucket as an improvised drain tank you won\u2019t have anything to connect your pipe to.",
    "Simply leave the PVC opening directly over your bucket.",
    "You have to use a flexible pipe if your PVC pipe isn\u2019t perfectly aligned with the opening of your drain pipe.",
    "Fill in the remaining space in your well with loose gravel.",
    "Take your loose gravel and pour it all around your drain tank.",
    "Fill in the space over your tank once the sides are filled.",
    "Continue adding gravel until the pile of rocks is flush with the bed of your soil.",
    "Smooth the pile out on top so that it\u2019s flat on your garden.",
    "Some people decorate the space around their gravel pit with flowers or decorative rocks.",
    "You can also add soil on top of the gravel, but this will make it hard to access your drain tank in the future.",
    "The gravel will ensure that the water drains evenly through the bottom of your well.",
    "Cover your ditch with soil or gravel.",
    "You can either use soil or gravel to fill in the ditch that runs from your downspout to the tank.",
    "Either use a shovel to add the soil that you dug out from your ditch or pour rocks over each section of pipe.",
    "Try to avoid walking directly on your gravel or soil when you\u2019re walking around your garden."
