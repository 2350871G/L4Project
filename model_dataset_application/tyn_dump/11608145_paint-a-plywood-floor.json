Open up doors and windows and turn on a fan if necessary to increase air circulation. Areas such as attics and basements can often have poor circulation. Be sure to aim a fan and open up whatever doors or windows you can to improve the flow of air. Wear a facemask if necessary to avoid breathing in the fumes."

If necessary, use wood glue or nails to attach them. For example, if the plywood flooring is laid over the ceiling joists of an attic, nail them to the joists so they\u2019re secure. It\u2019s very important that the plywood is firmly attached so it doesn\u2019t move around when you\u2019re walking on or painting it."
