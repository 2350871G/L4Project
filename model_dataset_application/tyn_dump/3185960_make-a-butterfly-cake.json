  "text":" Simple butterfly cake Cut the cake in half. This will form the butterfly's wings. Assemble the cake on the serving plate. It is easier to decorate the butterfly in position, as it can't be moved once made. Place the candy length down the center of the plate. This serves as the butterfly's body. Place the two wings on opposite sides of the candy, resting on the plate. Face the curve in toward the butterfly's body, the straight edges facing outward. Decorate the wings. The wings can be decorated in any fashion you like. The basics are:\nIce or frost both sides of the cake. Stick candies onto the cake in symmetrical patterns on each wing (mimic the same pattern, mirror image, both sides). Sprinkle with edible glitter, sprinkles, or other small cake decorating items. Add a head and antennae. Use a round candy ball for the head. Unroll licorice lengths or similar candy to make the antennae\u2013\u2013then re-roll the top portion to give it a little curl. Shaped butterfly cake If the cake has a dome (the raised portion of the cake), gently slice this off. The round cake needs to be flat on both sides. Turn the cake over.  Cut the cake exactly in half. This will create two semi-circles. Keeping the two semi-circles together, as if the cake were still whole, cut the cake like a peace sign. To help you get this exact, use toothpicks as markers, placed before cutting the cake. Once this is done, you now have four wing pieces. Place the semi-circles back to back, with the rounded sides touching. The straight edges will be facing out. At this point, you'll already start to see the formation of a butterfly shape. Slightly part the cake pieces. Pull the top wings up and the bottom wings down and you'll see an ideal butterfly shape, ready for frosting. Place this arrangement onto the cake serving plate.

Simply lay a long striped candy stick down the middle wing joints to form the butterfly's body. Two butterfly cakes Bake the cake according to the directions on the cake box or recipe. The important thing is to bake the cake in two 9 inch (22 cm) round cake pans. You will be able to make two butterfly cakes (or freeze one for later). Cool the cakes for a short time after removing them from the oven. Remove the cakes from the pans and continue to cool the cakes completely. Place one round cake on a cutting board. Cut the cake in half along the diameter with a bread knife. Separate the two halves. Cut out a triangular notch of cake a little below the middle of the cut side of each half of the cake. The piece you cut away should have sides of 1 1/2 in. (4 cm) in length. Position each half of the cake on a platter or cake board. Place the pieces where the round edges are barely touching in the middle. This will form the butterfly wings. Cover the cake in cake icing. Go over the icing with a butter knife to smooth out the icing. Decorate the cake with decorator icing and assorted candies. Be sure that you keep the decorations on the butterfly wings symmetrical. Place a straight candy stick in the middle of the cake to form the body of the butterfly. Licorice or fruit roll ups make nice antennae. You can sprinkle the entire cake with sugar when you finish to add a glittery touch to decorate the cake. Repeat for the second cake.  Store the cakes covered loosely until ready to serve. Serve side by side if you want a pair of butterfly cakes or place at different ends of the table to serve more guests with ease.",
