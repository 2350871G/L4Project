If you don't have a deep fryer, you could pour the oil into a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Use a frying thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil. It should remain at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for the duration of the cooking process. Adjust your temperature settings as needed to achieve this."

Thorough cleaning is important if you intend to keep the skins on for your fries. On the other hand, if you prefer fries without skin, peel the potatoes first and rinse them under running water when finished. Since the dirty skins are gone, you won't need to scrub the potatoes with a brush."

If your mandolin allows you to choose the thickness of the slices, choose a thickness of at least 1/4 inch (6 mm). If you don't have a mandolin, you could also use a ridged cheese knife. Make a straight cut down over the end of the potato and create slices roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick, if not a little thicker."

The resulting crisscross should produce the waffle fry shape. If you do not rotate the potato, your slices will look like ridges instead of waffles. Continue slicing in this manner, rotating the potato 90 degrees in between each slice. Repeat until you slice through both potatoes."

Watch the fries closely to prevent them from burning. You need to fry the potatoes in batches instead of frying them all at once. Adding too many to the hot oil can crowd out the pan and cause the temperature to drop. As a result, the fries won't cook correctly."
