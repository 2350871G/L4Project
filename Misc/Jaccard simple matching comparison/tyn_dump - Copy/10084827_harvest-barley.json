                    "description": "It takes around 2 months for barley to grow large enough to harvest and have the largest yield of grains. When the stalks turn completely yellow, the moisture levels in the barley are lower and they are easier to cut down. Spring barley grown in the Northern Hemisphere is typically harvested in July or August while winter barley is harvested in the April or May. The moisture level of the barley should be less than 18 percent. Moisture levels can be determined by measuring the barley\u2019s weight or by using an electronic moisture meter."

Work from one side of the barley crop to the other in large swinging motions. Hold the top of the grain with your non-dominant hand while you use a sickle with your dominant hand. Use caution when you use a scythe or sickle since they are very sharp. Take your time as you use a scythe or sickle since it could strain your arms and back."
