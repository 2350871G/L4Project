To harvest the peanuts, uproot the entire plant with a spading fork, which you can purchase at your local hardware store. Shake all of the soil off of the roots. It\u2019s unwise to wait much later than early fall to harvest your peanuts, especially if you live in an area with cold winters and early frosts. The peanuts could freeze and die underground. Since the peanut bushes are relatively small (compared to nut-bearing trees), you should have a peanut harvest in your first year of growing."

As part of caring for the hazelnut bushes during these years, cut away all young suckers that emerge from the base of the trunk and roots.

        "The peanuts need to fully dry out before being eaten raw, salted, or roasted.",
        "Hang them in a cool, dry room, like a cellar or basement, where the peanut plants won\u2019t be disturbed while they\u2019re drying.",
        "Once the plants have dried, pluck the peanuts off of the plant husks.",
        "Discard the plants.",
        "You can eat the peanuts raw.",
        "Store uneaten peanuts in an airtight container.",
        "Keep the container in your kitchen pantry.",
        "Planting and Harvesting Hazelnuts Plant hazelnuts in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil in full sun.",
        "The easiest way to grow hazelnuts is by purchasing young plants\u2014or immature root balls\u2014from a nearby nursery.",
        "These bushes thrive when given plenty of nutrients and when planted in direct sunlight.",
        "So, if you\u2019re planting hazelnuts outdoors, you may need to mix some potting soil and sand into the outdoor soil to increase the porosity and nutrient quality.",
        "A mature hazelnut bush will grow to be roughly 10 feet (3.0 m) tall, and equally wide.",
        "Dig out a hole that\u2019s twice the size of each root ball.",
        "Young hazelnut bushes need a generous amount of loose soil to spread their roots in.",
        "So, if your root ball has a diameter of 8 inches (20 cm), dig a hole that\u2019s 16 inches (41 cm) wide and deep.",
        "Also use your shovel or trowel to loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole, so the roots can grow downwards.",
        "Space individual hazelnut bushes out by at least 20 feet (6.1 m).",
        "Be sure to plant at least 2 bushes, since the plants fertilize one another, and a bush planted in isolation will not bear nuts.",
        "Give the separate bushes plenty of room to grow\u2014but do not plant them farther than 40 feet (12 m), or they won\u2019t be able to interpollinate.",
        "Wait for 5-7 years for the bushes to bear nuts.",
        "Typically, it will take the hazelnut bushes 3-4 years to grow to their mature size, and an additional 2-3 years for them to begin bearing nuts.",
        "During this time, you shouldn\u2019t need to water the bushes, since hazelnuts are very resistant to dry conditions.",
        "As part of caring for the hazelnut bushes during these years, cut away all young suckers that emerge from the base of the trunk and roots.",
        "Once the 5-7 years have passed, you can expect to begin seeing hazelnuts forming in late spring.",
        "Harvest hazelnuts in fall months by pulling the burrs apart.",
        "Individual hazelnuts grow in clusters called burrs, which contain anywhere from 1-12 nuts.",
        "In fall, the burrs will turn brown, indicating that they\u2019re ready to be harvested.",
        "Pull the burrs off of the bushes, and collect them in a bucket or basket.",
        "Then, pull the individual burrs apart and allow the nuts inside to fall out.",
        "In most cases, the force of gravity should be enough to draw the nuts out of the burrs.",
        "Dry the nuts on newspaper for 3-4 days.",
        "Once you\u2019ve broken the nuts out from the burrs, they need time to dry out.",
        "Set them on a newspaper on a flat surface, like tabletop or clean floor.",
        "Make sure to set the nuts in an area where they won\u2019t be disturbed by kids or pets while drying.",
        "Once the nuts have dried, you can either roast them or store them.",
        "Store hazelnuts in an airtight container in your kitchen pantry.",
        "(Un-roasted hazelnuts are unpleasant to eat.)",
        "Planting and Maintaining Almond Trees Choose a location with full sun and fertile, well-drained soil.",
        "Almond trees won\u2019t thrive if they are not planted in a location with less than 6-8 hours of sunlight each day.",
        "They also need soil with good drainage.",
        "If you notice that the soil where you plan to plant the almond trees frequently forms puddles, try adding peat or sand to the soil before planting the trees.",
        "Dig a hole deep enough to accommodate the tree\u2019s root structure.",
        "When the tree has been planted, the soil should come up to the already-existing soil line that\u2019s present on most nursery-grown almond trees.",
        "If you\u2019re planning to plant more than 1 almond tree, space the individual trees out by 15\u201320 feet (4.6\u20136.1 m).",
        "If you plant the almond trees too closely together, their branches and roots may collide with those of the adjacent trees.",
        "Spread out the roots when placing the almond tree in the ground.",
        "If the trees\u2019 roots are bundled up, unpack them a little before planting the tree.",
        "Also take care to not bend or damage the tree\u2019s large taproot when you plant it.",
        "To ensure that your almond tree grows well, pour 2\u20133 cups (470\u2013710 mL) of water over the roots before planting.",
        "Pour another 2-3 buckets of water over the almond tree once it\u2019s planted to ensure the roots remain moist.",
        "Water the young almond tree by letting water trickle from a hose.",
        "If your almond tree hasn\u2019t received any rain for 14 days (2 weeks), take it upon yourself to water the tree.",
        "Rather than drenching it with water, turn a garden hose on to release a trickle of water, and set the end of the hose at the base of the tree.",
        "Let the hose run until the ground is soaked.",
        "After the first 2 years, your almond tree will not need to be watered any more, unless it undergoes severe drought conditions.",
        "Prune almond trees in the winter.",
        "While the trees are dormant, you can remove unneeded branches without damaging the almond trees.",
        "Use a sharp pair of garden shears to lop off any branches that are dead or broken, or that have bent to grow towards the tree\u2019s center.",
        "Prune branches near the center of each almond tree so air and light can get through.",
        "Your almond trees will need to mature for 2-4 years before they begin producing almonds.",
        "Harvest the almonds in the fall by knocking them from the trees.",
        "The almonds themselves will grow inside of large, wood-colored hulls.",
        "They\u2019ll be ready to harvest once the hulls have opened completely on their own.",
        "Shake the tree in order to knock the almond hulls to the ground.",
        "Once the nuts have fallen, leave them on the ground for 2 or 3 days to dry out.",
        "Pry the shells from the hull, and pry the nuts from the shell.",
        "You\u2019ll need a good nutcracker for this part of the harvesting process.",
        "Snap the hull open until you can extract the almond shell.",
        "Then, crack open the shells until the almond nut itself emerges.",
        "Store the almonds in an airtight container or plastic bag.",
        "Keep the nuts in your pantry or a kitchen cabinet."
