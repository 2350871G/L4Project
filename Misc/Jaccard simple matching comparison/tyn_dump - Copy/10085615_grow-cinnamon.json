        "If you are planting a seed, then use your finger or a stick to make a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) deep hole instead.",
        "You can plant multiple seeds in 1 pot because you'll be thinning them out later.",
        "Keep the holes about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart.",
        "You can only plant 1 tree per 1 4 ft (1.2 m).",
        "Set the tree into the hole, then tamp the soil down.",
        "Remove the tree from the flimsy pot that it came in first, then gently loosen the root ball.",
        "Set the tree into the hole, then fill the gaps in with more soil.",
        "Gently pat the soil down with your hands.",
        "If you are starting with seeds, place 1 seed into each hole, then brush soil over the hole.",
        "Water the soil.",
        "Use enough water to make the soil damp.",
        "If you planted your tree in a pot, then keep watering it until the water starts to come out of the drainage hole(s) at the bottom.",
        "After this initial watering, you don't need to water the tree again until the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) are dry.",
        "Don\u2019t use tap water since it is often treated with chemicals.",
        "Thin the seedlings once they emerge.",
        "Wait until the seedlings form their first set of true leaves; they will be larger and darker than the other leaves.",
        "Next, choose the strongest, healthiest-looking seedling, and pluck out the rest.",
        "You can discard the plucked seedlings or transplant them into separate pots.",
        "If you started with a young tree, then you don\u2019t need to worry about thinning it out.",
        "Caring for the Cinnamon Wait until the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) are dry before watering the tree.",
        "Depending on how hot and sunny it is, you may end up watering as seldom as once per week to as often as every single day.",
        "Once the tree have matured, after about 3 years, you only need to water it during droughts.",
        "This is because the roots have grown deep enough to reach the damp soil.",
        "Test the soil's moisture by sticking your finger into it.",
        "If the soil feels dry, it's time to water.",
        "Apply a time-release fertilizer between late winter and early fall.",
        "Choose a 8-3-9 or 10-10-10 time-release fertilizer, and apply it in a 20 in (51 cm) radius around the base of the tree.",
        "Drag a gardening fork through the fertilizer to mix it into the soil.",
        "Do this once or twice each week, starting in late winter and finishing in the fall.",
        "You can also use an organic fertilizer made from rotted manure and plants.",
        "Read the instructions that came with your fertilizer to find out exactly when, how much, and how often you should use it.",
        "Each brand will be different.",
        "Once the tree matures after 2 to 3 years, you should use twice as much fertilizer.",
        "Keep a clear 10 to 12 in (25 to 30 cm) radius around tree.",
        "This includes things like mulch, grass, weeds, and other ground coverings.",
        "All of these things can harbor pests that can harm your tree.",
        "To prevent this, keep a 10 to 12 in (25 to 30 cm) radius around the base of the trunk free of any mulch or vegetation.",
        "Vegetation includes things like grass and weeds.",
        "Remove the weeds 3 to 4 times per year for the first 2 years.",
        "After that, you only need to remove the weeds 1 or 2 times per year.",
        "Treat diseased areas with fungicides or remove them.",
        "Removing the diseased area is the safest, surest method.",
        "In some cases, such as with blight or gray leaf spot, you may be able to use fungicides.",
        "In more extreme cases, such as stripe cankers, you'll have to remove the diseased portion.",
        "Watch out for: blight (gray leaf spot), brown root, pink disease, and stripe canker.",
        "Don't toss the diseased bark and stems into the compost bin or you'll contaminate it.",
        "You need to destroy them.",
        "Disinfect your tools afterwards with rubbing alcohol or a solution of 1 part bleach and 9 parts water.",
        "Eliminate pests with herbicides.",
        "Insecticides are not very effective because they don't kill the eggs.",
        "If you don't kill the eggs, then they will hatch, and you'll have to deal with the pests all over again.",
        "Common cinnamon pests include: borers, caterpillars, jumping plant louse, leaf miners, and mites.",
        "Be sure to peel back the bark and treat the area underneath it.",
        "This is where all the eggs tend to be.",
        "When in doubt, treat the entire stem.",
        "Harvesting the Bark Wait until the tree is 2 years old before you harvest it.",
        "You do not need to prune the tree since the harvesting process will take care of that.",
        "You'll know when the tree is ready for harvesting when the bark turns brown and the leaves grow firm.",
        "Cut 4 to 6 stems to the ground between late spring and late summer.",
        "Choose 4 to 6 straight, healthy-looking stems, then use a fine-toothed saw to cut them down until they are 1.5 to 2.5 inches (3.8 to 6.4 cm) long.",
        "Make sure the cuts at 30-degree angles, slanting towards the middle/inside of the tree.",
        "It would be even better to do so during the rainy season as the bark will be easier to peel away.",
        "Cut the shoots into shorter lengths, then score the bark.",
        "Something between 3 and 4 inches (7.6 and 10.2 cm) would be ideal.",
        "Use a sharp knife to slice the bark apart lengthwise (from top-to-bottom) on each mini shoot.",
        "If the harvested stem was older, you may have to cut a little into the wood.",
        "Peel the bark off of the mini shoots, then set it out to dry.",
        "Use your fingers or a knife to pry the bark away from the wood.",
        "Once you have the bark peeled off, set it out in a shady area for about 4 to 5 days so that it can dry out.",
        "The bark will start to curl up naturally on its own after you peel it.",
        "This is your cinnamon stick!",
        "Wait 2 years before harvesting the cinnamon again.",
        "like many other spices, cinnamon can last a long time.",
        "This means that your original batch of harvested cinnamon should last you until the next harvest.",
        "You can harvest 4 to 6 stems every 2 years.",
        "If this is an indoor tree, you can cut the stems shorter if they are growing too long.",
        "Left to itself, a cinnamon tree can grow up to 8 feet (2.4 m).",
        "Don\u2019t harvest the same stems each time."
