They all have the same application, but they have different finishes. Solid-color stains are best for completely changing the color of the wood, sort of like paint. It may cover up the grain.

Even if a brand suggests that only 12 to 24 hours are enough, it would be much better to wait 24 to 48 hours. This will ensure that the stained surface is completely dry. You do not need to apply a sealer because the stain already acts as one. If the stain isn't dark enough or deep enough for you, then apply a second coat. Discard the used rags in a water-filled bucket. This is very important. Wood stain is flammable, so putting the rags or sponges into a water-filled bucket will prevent fires. Seal the bucket, then discard it at a hazardous-waste center. Be sure to clean your brush well with a solvent-based cleaner. Maintaining the Stain Pressure wash the cedar every 2 to 4 years. This may remove some of the stain, but it is key to keeping the cedar in tiptop condition and helping it last longer. You should pressure wash it the same way that you did in the beginning, prior to staining.Be careful when using the pressure washer as it may damage the wood. If possible, reduce the pressure so that it is not as strong. Reapply the stain every 3 to 5 years. Stain is pretty durable, but it will fade over time, especially if it is exposed to the elements.
