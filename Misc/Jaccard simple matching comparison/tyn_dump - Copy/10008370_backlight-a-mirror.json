To use mounting bars, take measurements of your mirror and buy mounting bars at your local hardware store to fit behind your mirror. Or, create spacers of your own by using small pieces of wood that are even in width. Glue the mounting bars or spacers to the back of your mirror using glass glue, silicone-based glue, or an all-purpose super glue. The goal of this step is to have your mirror lay 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) away from the wall. Any way that you are able to achieve this, without the spacers being seen from the front, is fine."

You want to be away from the edge so that the lights are not easily seen behind the mirror when they are attached. To measure the circumference of a round mirror, start at a point 2 in (5.1 cm) away from the mirror\u2019s edge at the top and measure to a point 2 in (5.1 cm) away from the bottom. Use a calculator to multiply this number by pi, or 3.14. To measure the perimeter of a rectangular mirror, measure all 4 sides of the rectangle starting and ending at points 2 in (5.1 cm) away from the corners. Add all of these measurements together. Write down the final number of your measurement. This is the length of LED strip you will need to backlight your mirror."
