        "Do not paint if it is raining or humid outside, as this can affect the curing process.",
        "Spray an even coat of self-etching primer onto the aluminum.",
        "Shake the can for about 30 to 60 seconds first, then hold it about 8 inches (20 cm) from the surface.",
        "Spray on a light, even coat using overlapping strokes.",
        "You can spray side-to-side or up-and-down.",
        "Overlap each stroke ever so slightly to ensure that you are covering the surface evenly.",
        "If your can has a different set of application instructions, you should follow those instead.",
        "If you are working with a multi-sided object, let the first side dry to the touch before priming the other sides.",
        "Let the primer dry for 15 minutes before adding a second coat.",
        "Check the can again to find out exactly how long you should wait before applying a second coat.",
        "Most primers will have a \"between coats\" drying time and a curing time.",
        "Refer to the \"between coats\" time for this.",
        "How long it takes for the primer to dry depends on the brand that you are using.",
        "In most cases, you'll have to wait between 5 and 15 minutes.",
        "Add 2 to 3 more coats, then wait about 1 hour for the primer to cure.",
        "Again, check your can to find out exactly how many coats of primer you should use and how long you should wait for it to cure.",
        "In most cases, you'll need about 3 to 4 coats of primer and wait about 1 hour for it to cure.",
        "Be patient and let the primer cure.",
        "If you don't wait long enough, the paint and primer may peel.",
        "Double-check the instructions on the can for more specific curing times.",
        "Remember to apply light coats of primer.",
        "This will help it cure properly.",
        "If you slap on a thick coat, the primer may go tacky or just peel off.",
        "Buff away imperfections with 400-grit sandpaper, if needed.",
        "Once the primer has cured, take a close look at it.",
        "If you like the finish, you are ready to move on.",
        "If it looks rough, pitted, or drippy, lightly buff the surface with 400-grit sandpaper.",
        "Be sure to wipe the surface clean with a tack cloth afterwards.",
        "Double-check the making tape after this.",
        "If the edges look frayed, peel it off and lay down new strips.",
        "Applying the Paint Buy acrylic or latex paint.",
        "For best results, choose paint with a matte or satin finish.",
        "While glossy paint will work, it is not recommended because it will show off any imperfections in the metal.",
        "Because you already applied the primer, you can use any type of paint you want.",
        "It does not have to be labeled \"for metal.\"",
        "If the piece that you are painting will be kept outdoors, choose a paint that's labeled \"exterior\" or \"outdoor.\"",
        "Spray paint will be the easiest to apply, but you can use brush-on paint too.",
        "Brush or spray on a light, even coat of paint.",
        "This is important, regardless of the type of paint you are using: brush-on or spray-on.",
        "Just like with the primer, apply the paint using straight, overlapping strokes.",
        "They can be horizontal or vertical, but they all need to go in the same direction.",
        "If you are using brush-on paint, use a flat, wide paintbrush may from synthetic fibers.",
        "Avoid soft camel hair or stiff boar bristle.",
        "If you're using spray paint, shake the can for about 1 minute first, then hold it about 8 inches (20 cm) from the surface while spraying it.",
        "For a multi-sided object, start with the top and sides.",
        "Once the paint feels dry, move onto the bottom.",
        "Wait about 15 minutes for the paint to dry to the touch.",
        "How long you wait for the paint to dry depends on what type of paint you are working with.",
        "In general, you'll only have to wait 5 to 15 minutes.",
        "You don't have to wait for this coat of paint to cure because you'll be adding more coats.",
        "Double-check the paint can to see how long you should wait for the paint to dry between coats.",
        "Add up to 3 more coats of paint, allowing each one to dry for 15 minutes.",
        "Once the previous coat of paint feels dry, you can apply the next coat.",
        "Refer to the paint can to find out how many coats of paint you should, and how long you should wait between coats.",
        "You don't have to wait for the paint to cure between coats.",
        "In most cases, you'll need at least 2 coats of paint.",
        "Let the paint dry and cure completely, about 24 to 72 hours.",
        "Again, how long this takes depends on the type of paint you are working with.",
        "If your can of paint has both a drying time and a curing time, you should follow the curing time.",
        "Drying and curing are too different things.",
        "This can take anywhere from 24 to 72 hours.",
        "Just because something feels dry to the touch does not mean that it's dry underneath.",
        "Once paint has cured, you can be sure that it's dry all the way through.",
        "If you want the unpainted metal to have the same finish as the painted metal, peel the masking tape off now.",
        "Apply 2 to 4 coats of clear enamel, letting each coat dry in between.",
        "Like with the paint, apply light coats consisting of overlapping strokes.",
        "Let each coat dry to the touch before applying the next coat.",
        "How long you have to wait depends on the type of enamel you are using.",
        "Spray enamel just like you applied spay-on primer and spray-on paint.",
        "Brush enamel on using a synthetic-bristle brush and straight, overlapping strokes.",
        "Enamel comes in different finishes: matte, satin, and glossy.",
        "Pick the one you like best, but be aware that glossy finishes will show imperfections more.",
        "Let the enamel cure completely, about 24 to 72 hours.",
        "Since each brand of enamel is different, read the instructions on the can to find out how long you should wait.",
        "If you left the masking tape on previously, wait until the sealer dries and cures before peeling it off.",
        "Don't use the piece before the enamel has finished curing, or it may turn tacky."
