        "In most cases you'll need salt for cotton or linen, and vinegar for silk or nylon.",
        "Some types of dye will need soda ash, which you can get in the tie dye section of a craft or fabric store.",
        "The amounts listed below are for 1 package of powered dye or 1/2 bottle of liquid dye.",
        "Salt: Mix 1 cup (273 g) of table salt and 4 cups (950 mL) hot water for natural fibers, such as cotton and linen.",

        "Plan to dye the slipcover in a washer if you want a convenient option.",
        "You need to stir the fabric often as it is dyeing in order for the color to turn out consistent.",
        "The good thing about washing machines is that they already do the agitating for you!",
        "Make sure that the washing machine is big enough for the slipcover.",
        "The slip cover needs to be able to move freely in the washer.",
        "Click here to learn how to dye the slipcover in a washing machine.",
        "Use a bathtub if you don't own a washing machine.",

        "Keep in mind that this method works best for natural fibers, such as cotton and linen.",
        "It\u2019s not recommended for synthetics, as the dye used for those needs to be kept at a constant boil.",

        "If you are working with synthetics and your washer is too small, you can try going to a laundromat.",
        "Using a Washing Machine Select a hot water cycle with an extra rinse.",
        "Put the slipcover into the washer first.",
        "Close the washer and select a hot water cycle with an extra rinse.",
        "If you can't select an extra rinse cycle, choose a setting that will add about 30 minutes to the cycle.",
        "If possible, set the water level to the highest level available.",
        "Add your liquid dye into the dispenser, then flush it with hot water.",
        "Pour your fabric dye directly into the detergent dispenser.",
        "Follow up with some hot water.",
        "If you're using bottled fabric dye, you can simply pour 2 bottles\u2019 worth of water; otherwise, 2 to 4 cups (470 to 950 mL) of hot water will do.",
        "This will help remove the dye residue from the compartment and prevent it from staining.",
        "Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of laundry detergent.",
        "While not absolutely necessary, this will help the item dye more evenly.",
        "The amounts in this step are for 1/2 bottle of liquid fabric dye or 1 box of prepared powdered dye.",
        "Let the cycle run for 10 minutes, then add the salt water solution.",
        "Close the washer first, then start the cycle and let it run for 10 minutes.",

        "Once you have the salt water solution in the dispenser, let the cycle finish.",
        "Do a second cycle, this time using warm water and mild detergent.",
        "It would be even better if you added an extra rinse cycle.",
        "The second warm-water cycle will ensure that any excess dye is rinsed out.",
        "How much detergent you use depends on the brand that you are using, so read the instructions on the bottle.",
        "Dry the slipcover, then put it on the chair while it is still damp.",
        "You can use a clothes dryer or hang the slipcover up to dry.",
        "Once it is about 90% dry, put it onto the chair (or couch), and let it finish drying.",
        "This will help reduce wrinkles.",
        "Be sure to empty out the lint trap if you used a dryer.",
        "Clean your washer using a hot water, high-level setting.",
        "You can also add some old rags you don't mind staining into the drum.",

        "At the end of the cycle, wipe down the inside of the drum and dispenser with an old rag.",
        "Use standard, household bleach or laundry bleach.",
        "If you don't have bleach, use 2 cups (470 mL) of vinegar instead.",
        "Do not mix bleach and vinegar, or this will create a dangerous chemical reaction.",
        "Using a Bathtub Line the bathtub with a plastic sheet.",
        "While it is not absolutely necessary to line the bathtub first, it is highly recommended as it will reduce the chances of the dye staining the tub.",
        "Simply tuck a large, plastic sheet or tablecloth into the tub, then tape down the edges.",
        "You can buy plastic tablecloths in party supply stores.",
        "Home improvement stores should sell plastic sheets.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s water-tight.",
        "Duct tape works especially well here, but you can use packaging tape as well.",
        "The goal here is to line the tub and prevent the dye water from touching it.",
        "Fill the tub with hot water, then add the dye.",
        "Read the instructions on the dye package to find out how much water you should use.",
        "Once you have the tub filled, pour the dye into the water, then give it a stir.",
        "Consider adding 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid detergent for every 1/2 bottle or 1 box of powered dye.",

        "Put on a pair of plastic gloves, then push down on the slipcover so that the fabric is completely submerged.",
        "Use a sturdy stick or paddle to stir the dye bath.",
        "You don\u2019t have to stir it continuously; you can stir it every 5 minutes or so.",
        "The stirring is important as it will help the fabric dye evenly.",
        "Add the fixative solution, then soak the slipcover for 45 minutes.",
        "The fixative solution is the salt, vinegar, or soda ash solution that you prepared earlier.",
        "Pour that into the water, then give the water a stir.",
        "Let the slipcover sit in the tub for 45 minutes, stirring it every 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Rinse the slipcover until the water runs clear.",
        "You can do this in the tub or in a washing machine.",
        "If you choose to do it in the tub, move aside the plastic lining and drain the tub first.",
        "If you choose to do it in the washing machine, run a cycle without any detergent.",
        "Plan on rinsing the slipcover at least 5 times in the tub or 3 times in the washer.",
        "To rinse the slipcover in the tub, you can either hold it under running water, or soak it in fresh batches of water for a few minutes at a time.",
        "To rinse the slipcover in the washing machine, simply run it through 3 rinse cycles.",
        "Dry the slipcover partway, then put it on the chair while it's still damp.",
        "Depending on what type of fabric it is made from, you can dry it in the dryer, or hang it up to dry instead.",
        "To reduce wrinkles, wait until it is about 90% dry, then put it on your chair or couch.",
        "If the bathtub got stained, you can remove the stain using a paste made from baking soda and water.",
        "You can also give it time; it will fade a little each time you shower."
