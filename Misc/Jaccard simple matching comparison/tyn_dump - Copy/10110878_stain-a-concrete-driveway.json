        "Be slow as you transfer the acid stain so it doesn\u2019t splash or spill.",
        "It\u2019s not necessary to dilute the acid with water, but you can mix it with an equal amount of water if you want a lighter color.",
        "Use caution when working with acid.",
        "Keep it away from your skin, eyes, or mouth since it is corrosive.",
        "Pump sprayers can be purchased at your local home and garden store.",
        "Pump sprayers with metal will corrode due to the hydrochloric acid present in the stain.",
        "Hold the nozzle 1 ft (0.30 m) from your driveway while applying the stain.",
        "Start in the center of your driveway and work your way out to the edges, using short back and forth strokes as you spread the acid.",
        "Spray the concrete so it is saturated but don\u2019t let the stain puddle.",
        "Make sure all areas of your concrete are covered so the stain works evenly across the entire surface.",
        "Let the acid dry for 4 hours.",
        "This allows the acid to set in the pores of your driveway so it can chemically change the color of the concrete.",
        "Avoid walking or driving on your driveway so you don\u2019t disturb the wet stain.",
        "Apply 1 or 2 more coats to get your desired color.",
        "It\u2019s typical to apply 2-3 coats of acid stain to get the exact color you want.",
        "Start in the center of your driveway again and work your way to the outer edges, allowing 4 hours of drying time in between each coat.",
        "Rinse a small corner of your driveway to see how the stain has affected the concrete to see if you like the color.",
        "If you\u2019re happy with the color after 1 coat, you can skip adding more.",
        "Wear disposable booties if you want to protect your shoes from the acid wash. Rinse the stain from your driveway after 4 hours until the water runs clear.",
        "Use a garden hose on a gentle setting to spray the residual stain off your driveway.",
        "Start in the middle of your driveway close to your home and spray the water toward the street.",
        "When the runoff water is clear, you\u2019re finished.",
        "You can use a broom to move any residue after you\u2019ve rinsed your driveway.",
        "Mix 2  c (470 mL) of ammonia with 5 US gal (19 L) of water.",
        "Use a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket to make the solution.",
        "This will help clean any residue that may be trapped in your concrete, but more importantly it will stop the acid from reacting with your concrete and stop further staining.",
        "This process is known as \u201cneutralization.\u201d Use a broom to spread the ammonia solution and gently clean away residue.",
        "Dip the end of your broom into the bucket with the solution or pour a small amount onto the concrete.",
        "Carefully move the solution across the entirety of your driveway.",
        "If you scrub too hard with the broom, it could lift some of the stain from your concrete and affect the color.",
        "Remember, you\u2019re not scrubbing the concrete, you\u2019re just moving the residue off of it.",
        "Spray the solution off of your driveway with a garden hose.",
        "Give your driveway a final rinse with your garden hose after you\u2019ve spread the ammonia solution.",
        "Spray the water until the runoff is clear and clean.",
        "Staining with Solid Colors Pick a color of water-based stain for your concrete.",
        "Water-based stain will give you a more vibrant color and completely cover your concrete, unlike acid stain that is more muted and translucent.",
        "Find a color that complements your yard and home.",
        "Solid color water-based stain can be purchased at a paint store or a home and garden store.",
        "Read the label to determine how much stain you\u2019ll need for the size of your driveway.",
        "Purchase 1 gallon (3.8 L) of stain for every 600 to 800 square feet (56 to 74 m) of concrete.",
        "Pour the stain into a roller bucket 18 in (0.46 m) wide.",
        "Once you have the stain in your bucket, use a stir stick to mix the stain thoroughly.",
        "While it\u2019s in the can, it may separate and won\u2019t produce an even coat if it\u2019s applied right away.",
        "Use a paintbrush to put the stain on the edges and cracks of the concrete.",
        "A wide paintbrush will work best and give you the most coverage.",
        "Use the tips of the bristles to work into the spaces in between the concrete slabs until you can only see the color of the stain.",
        "Work around each of the edges of your driveway.",
        "If you have mulch or dirt next to your driveway, move it away from the concrete to paint down the sides of the concrete.",
        "Paint the stain onto the concrete with a 9 in (23 cm) roller.",
        "Start on the end of the driveway near your home and work toward the street.",
        "Dip the entire roller in the bucket and move it back and forth so it\u2019s covered in the stain.",
        "Shake any excess back into the bucket before rolling it onto your driveway in long back and forth strokes.",
        "Use a long-handled roller so you can stand up rather than kneel on the ground.",
        "Overlap each stroke you make by about 2 inches (5.1 cm) to coat the entire driveway.",
        "A thin coat works best for the base layer of stain.",
        "The stain should not pool up as you\u2019re applying it.",
        "Let the stain dry overnight.",
        "Solid color stain usually takes 2 coats and you should wait 24 hours before starting on your next coat.",
        "This gives the stain time to dry and set so you can walk on it the next day.",
        "Use wet paint signs to let others know not to walk on your driveway.",
        "Add a second coat going the opposite direction as your first coat.",
        "For example, if you painted up and down your driveway for the base coat, paint across your driveway for the second coat.",
        "Cover the entirety of your driveway with a thick layer of the stain.",
        "Don\u2019t drive on the stained driveway for 2 days so it has time to completely dry and set.",
        "Sealing Your Concrete When You\u2019re Finished Purchase a concrete sealer from your local hardware store.",
        "A sealer will help waterproof the surface of your driveway, protect it from future stains, and enhance the color of the stain you\u2019ve used.",
        "Read the label on the sealer to determine how much you should use for the size of your driveway.",
        "Paint the sealer on the edges and cracks in your concrete with a paintbrush.",
        "Dip a wide-bristle paintbrush into the sealer and use it between the concrete slabs and around the outer edges.",
        "Work the tips of the bristles into the cracks so they are thoroughly protected.",
        "Make sure the concrete is completely dry before applying any sealer\nWork the sealer onto the sides of the slab next to dirt or mulch if you\u2019re able to.",
        "Use a clean 9 in (23 cm) roller to spread the sealer.",
        "Spread the sealer evenly across the surface of the paint roller and apply it to the concrete.",
        "Start from the middle of the driveway in short back and forth strokes and work your way towards the edges of the concrete.",
        "Opt for a long-handled roller so you don\u2019t have to kneel on the ground while you work.",
        "Spread the sealer evenly so it doesn\u2019t puddle.",
        "You want to saturate the concrete, but not have excess sealer or else it could affect your stain.",
        "Allow the sealer to dry for 2 days before bringing cars on your driveway.",
        "Let the sealer cure completely before walking or driving on the surface.",
        "It will typically take 2 days if the weather is dry and warm.",
        "If it\u2019s humid, allow at least 1 more day for it to dry.",
        "Hang up wet paint signs or place cones in front of your driveway so no one can drive a vehicle onto the concrete."
