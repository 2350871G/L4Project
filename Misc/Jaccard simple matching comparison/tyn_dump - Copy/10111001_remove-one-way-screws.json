Hold the head of the screwdriver up to the one-way screw head until you find a size match. Flatten 2 opposing sides of the screw head with a file.

This will allow your pliers to have a firm grasp on the flattened portions of the screw. If you don\u2019t file flat portions into the screw head, your pliers may just slip off when you try to remove the screw. Fasten a pair of locking pliers around the screw head.

If the screw slips out from the head of the pliers, simply put the pliers back in place and continue unscrewing. Removing the Screws with a Extractor Tool Purchase a one-way screw extractor tool from a hardware store. Removal tools look like a typical screwdriver but have 2 steel pins located at their end. One-way screw removal tools come in different sizes based on the size of the screw itself. Common extractor tool sizes include sizes for #6-8 size screws, for #10-12 size screws, and for #14-16 size screws. So, you\u2019ll need to find the size of the screw and purchase the removal tool that corresponds to that size. One-way extractor tools may be difficult to find. If they\u2019re not in stock at your local store, try to find a tool through major online retailers or at large home-goods supply stores. A extractor tool costs about $25 USD. Set the tool\u2019s steel pins against the rounded edges of the screw head. Hold the tool as if you were holding a typical screwdriver, and set its pins in the open slot on top of the screw\u2019s head. It should fit into position against the screw head\u2019s rounded sides. Keep in mind that, while they\u2019re a useful tool, extractor tools are not guaranteed to work. For example, if the screw was driven into wood or screwed in with a power driver, you probably will not be able to remove it with the extraction tool. Try drilling through the head to remove the screw. Turn the extractor tool counterclockwise to remove the one-way screw. Press the 2 steel pins forward into the screw head while you\u2019re twisting.

Once you\u2019ve extracted the screw head by about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm), you may be able to grab it with your fingers and finish unscrewing by hand. Drilling Through the Head to Remove the Screws Select a drill bit that\u2019s \u00bc the diameter of the screw head. This will ensure that the drill bit is roughly the same diameter as the screw shaft. You can use this drill bit to drill through the screw head and down to the shaft of the screw. This method will destroy the head of the screw, but is effective at removing the screw. If you don\u2019t have a power drill and drill bits, you can purchase them at a local hardware store. Drill counterclockwise into the center of the one-way screw. Position the center of the drill bit over the middle of the screw head, and begin drilling straight into the screw. Be sure that you\u2019re drilling counterclockwise. Most drills have a switch you can flip to alter the direction that the drill bit rotates. This process is messy and will leave a pile of metal shavings below the spot where you\u2019re drilling. Continue drilling counterclockwise until the bit is \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) deep. The idea is to keep drilling until the drill bit passes through the screw head and into the part of the screw that has threading. Since you\u2019re drilling counterclockwise, the drill bit will catch the screw threads and begin to extract the screw. Remove the screw shaft with locking pliers. Take a pair of locking pliers, and fasten them securely around the top of the screw\u2019s shaft. Turn the screw counterclockwise so that it begins to loosen.
