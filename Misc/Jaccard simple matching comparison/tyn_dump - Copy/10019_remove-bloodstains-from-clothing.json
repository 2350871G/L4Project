    "text": " Using Soap and Water Wet the stain with cold water. Blot a small stain with cold water to make sure it doesn\u2019t run. You can also run it under a faucet of streaming cold water. If the stain is large, submerge it into a bowl or basin of cold water. Do not use warm or hot water. This will make the stain worse. If the stain does run, you will need to treat the run as part of the stain. Apply soap to the blood stain. You can use regular hand soap or bar soap for this. Lather the stain gently by rubbing it with a sponge. Then, rinse the soap out in cold water. Reapply soap and repeat the process if needed. Wash the clothing as usual. If you see that the stain has let up, you can wash it as normal. Make sure to wash it alone. Use the same detergent as you normally would. Do not, however, use warm water on the washing machine cycle. Let the clothing air dry. The heat from a tumbler dryer can prevent the stain from fading completely, so do not put the clothing in the dryer. Instead, hang it up so that it can air dry. Once it is dry, you can store the clothing away or wear it. Repeat the process or try another method if the stain hasn\u2019t faded completely. Do not iron the clothing if the blood stain is still visible. Cleaning with a Salt Solution Rinse the stain in cold water. Try to get some of the stain out by rinsing it in cold water. Blot the stain with cold water and a towel. Or, you can run the stain under cold water. Make a paste out of salt and water. Mix one part cold water and two parts salt together to create a paste. The amount of water and salt you need depends on the size of the stain. Do not mix so much water with the salt that you\u2019ve created a liquid. The paste should be spreadable. Apply the paste to the stain. You can use your hand or a clean cloth to apply the paste to the stain. Rub the paste gently over the stain. You should begin to see the stain let up. Rinse the clothing in cold water. Once most or all of the stain has come out, run the clothing under cold water. Rinse it until the paste has been removed. If most of the stain hasn\u2019t come out, reapply the paste. Launder as normal. Use whatever detergent you normally would for that particular piece of clothing. Do not, however, use anything but cold water to wash the piece of clothing. Hang up the clothing to air dry once it has finished washing. Using Hydrogen Peroxide Test the hydrogen peroxide on a small spot of the clothing. Hydrogen peroxide can bleach some fabrics, so it is important to test it on a small, hidden spot of the clothing before use. Use a Q-tip or pour a very small amount, and use another method if you see discoloration. Dilute the hydrogen peroxide for delicate fabrics. Pour 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water into a container. You can test this solution on a piece of the clothing if you\u2019re not sure it has been diluted enough. Pour hydrogen peroxide directly onto the stain. Make sure you pour the hydrogen peroxide only on the stain and nowhere else on the fabric. You will see it begin to foam up when it is working. Rub the hydrogen peroxide in with your hands to make sure it saturates the stain.. Repeat the process if necessary. One application of hydrogen peroxide may not do the trick, especially if it is a large stain. Apply more hydrogen peroxide if the first application does not fade or remove the stain. Wipe the stain between each application. Rinse with cold water. Once the stain has been removed, rinse it under cold water. You can then choose to wash it in the washing machine or leave it as is.

Ammonia is a strong chemical and should only be used on tough stains. Do not use this method on delicate fabrics like silk, linen, or wool. Let the ammonia sit on the stain for a few minutes.
