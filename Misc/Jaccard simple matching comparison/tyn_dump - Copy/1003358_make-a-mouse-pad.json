If you'd rather have a pattern, you can use wallpaper or wrapping paper. Thrift stores are a great place to find cheap remnants of wallpaper perfect for crafting. Fabric is also a good material for solid or patterned mousepads. You can find fabric at any local hobby store or repurpose an old cotton shirt. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/91\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/91\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Cut to size.

After you cut it to size, you will want to attach your fabric or paper top to the base. White glue or mod podge works well for paper tops. Just use a paintbrush to spread a thin, even layer of glue onto the surface of your base, and then smooth on your top layer of paper. If you are using fabric, use fabric glue or a spray adhesive for the best results. Avoid hot glue, as this will leave lumps in your mouse pad. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e7\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e7\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Cover the top with clear contact paper. The clear contact paper will protect your design and allow your mouse to move smoothly. First, cut your contact paper to size. Then, peel off its backing, and apply it to your mousepad. Be sure to smooth out any air bubbles. You can use the side of a ruler as a tool for smoothing. If you'd rather skip the decorative paper or fabric, you can simply use an opaque contact paper with a preprinted design. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4b\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4b\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Creating a Quick Temporary Mousepad Gather your materials. To make a very simple pad, you will need a small book or similarly shaped flat object, a plastic envelope, and some tape. The book inside the envelope creates a nice flat surface for your mouse to glide on. If you don't have an envelope, you can also use a zip lock bag. If you're in a real hurry, you can use a thick magazine or a book alone as a mousepad. Make sure the book you use has a smooth cover and enough surface area. Simply place the book or magazine beside your computer. Choose the exterior of your mousepad. If you have a plastic envelope, this works best. It has a smooth surface and a small amount of cushioning. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/76\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/76\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Cut your envelope in half.
