Keep repeating the process until the tripe looks and feels like it's both smooth and clean. Scrape the surface.

The chlorine on bleached tripe can also get into the other foods you are cooking, which could make the whole meal smell like bleach. Boiling the Tripe Steep the tripe in a bowl of water for 1 hour. Make sure that the tripe is completely covered by the water. This ensures that all of the tripe is being sufficiently soaked. Place the tripe in a large pot. Pour some cold water into the pot and bring it to the boil. Allow the tripe to boil for between 30 and 45 minutes. Add a tablespoon of salt for every liter of water in the pot. Boiling the tripe is important as it removes any dangerous bacteria from the tripe. It also makes the tripe easier to cut and slice later, as well as reducing the cooking time when preparing the meal. Drain the pot and rinse the tripe again. Use cold water to wash the tripe. Rigorously and repeatedly rinsing the tripe is very important to ensuring the tripe is as clean as it can be. Refill the pot and allow it to simmer. Then place the tripe back in the pot. Allow the tripe to simmer in the pot for 2 to 3 hours. The water will slowly evaporate so remember to occasionally add water into the pot to keep the tripe covered. Cutting the Tripe Place the tripe on the cutting board. Lay the smoother side down and as flat as possible. The tripe is now at its easiest to cut after the boiling and simmering. Inspect the tripe for unnecessary parts. Now that the tripe has been thoroughly cleaned, have a look at it once more to see if there is any fat or grit that needs to be sliced off.
