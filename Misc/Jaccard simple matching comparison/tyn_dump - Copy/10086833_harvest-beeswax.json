The smoke from the smoker gives the bees the impression that the hive is on fire, so they begin to feast on the honey as a way to preserve it. Eating a lot of honey makes the bees get drowsy, so they are less likely to bother you as you get the wax caps out of the hive. A hive tool resembles a crowbar."
