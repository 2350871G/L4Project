                    "description": "You want to cut back your grass once a year, as late in the season as possible. For warm season grasses, you want to trim them between late fall and mid-spring. For cool season grasses, cut them back in early spring. Cutting your grass in the wrong season can impact its ability to grow and pollinate. Your grass should be brown before you start cutting it back. Ideally, you should wait until at least mid-winter or early spring to cut it back. Some insect species will spend the winter in bunch grasses. Wait until the spring to cut the previous season\u2019s growth to protect wildlife. Examples of warm-season grasses include Japanese forest grass, Japanese silver grass, switchgrass, fountain grass, maiden grass, and prairie cordgrass. Examples of cool-season grasses include fescues, blue oat grass, tufted hair grass, and autumn moor grass."

Use a piece of rope, bungee cords, or gardening twine to gather each grass plant into a column, and cinch the grass about a third to halfway up the length of the stocks. You should tie the grass tight enough that you will be able to cut through multiple stocks at the same time, but not so much that you break the grass. If your grass is as tall or taller than you, you may want to tie a second length of rope up toward the top of the stocks so that trimmings don\u2019t fall down on you and obscure your vision during the cutting process."
