                    "description": "Deadheading means trimming off blooms when they first begin to fade. For rosette salvia, the flowers will usually fade towards the middle of the summer and begin dropping seeds. Plan on removing any flowers as soon as they begin turning to a dull green or brown color. Trimming the flowers causes the salvia to bloom a second time. Normal salvia blooms are colorful, so you can easily see when bright blue or violet flowers begin fading."
