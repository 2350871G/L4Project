Especially if your peripheral vision has been affected by an injury, undergoing regular eye exercises with a physical therapist may help as well. Testing Your Peripheral Vision at Home Prepare a 60 by 30 cm (24 by 12 in) piece of cardboard for use. The sheet of cardboard can be larger than these dimensions, but not smaller. If it is larger, use a ruler and pencil to draw a 60 by 30 cm (24 by 12 in) rectangle on it. Along one of the long edges of this 60 x 30 rectangle, stick a pushpin at the halfway point (so it's 30 cm (12 in) from each end). You can also use a piece of rigid foam board instead of cardboard. Draw a large half-circle within the 60 by 30 cm (24 by 12 in) rectangle. Tie one end of a piece of string to the pushpin, and the other end to a pencil placed at the midpoint of the opposite long edge of the cardboard. Keep the string pulled tight and move the pencil back and forth over the cardboard sheet. The string will guide it to make a half-circle shape. Draw a smaller half-circle with a 2 cm (0.79 in) radius. Wind the string around the pencil until the distance between the pencil and pushpin is reduced to 2 cm (0.79 in). Trace a second, much smaller half-circle onto the board. This smaller circle will become the cut-out for your nose. Cut your cardboard into the shape of a rainbow. Use sturdy scissors or a utility knife to cut along both the larger and smaller half-circles. It doesn't have to be perfect, but take your time to ensure a smooth curve to your rainbow-shaped board. If this is part of a child's science project, an adult should supervise this task or do it themselves. Scissors and especially utility knives can be very dangerous. Tape a cup to the underside of the board to serve as a handle. Pick a spot roughly halfway between where the pushpin and pencil were when you started tracing. Use double-sided tape or glue to attach the bottom of a disposable plastic cup to what will be the underside of your board. You'll hold the cup with both hands to keep the board in position while taking the test. Insert a pushpin into the apex of the rainbow shape. Stick the pushpin you used earlier back into the cardboard, this time just short of the spot where you originally placed the pencil to start tracing. This will serve as your focal point while you take the test. The pushpin might stick all the way through the cardboard, so be careful not to prick your finger on it while testing! Cut 6 rectangular strips from red, yellow, and green construction paper. Each strip should be 10 by 2 cm (3.94 by 0.79 in). Use rigid construction paper, or use markers to color strips of a rigid white paper (like index cards). You can use a different combination of easy-to-distinguish colors, but red, yellow, and green are the ideal combination. Use scissors to give half of the colored strips a pointed end. Take 3 of the strips (one of each color) and trim off two of the corners on one of the short sides of each. This will create a triangular shape at one end of each of them. When your friend uses one of these triangular strips during the test, make sure they hold it with the pointed end up. Hold the board to your face with your nose in the small cutout.

        "The paper strip should be beyond your field of vision when at the starting point.",
        "If you can detect it being there, make sure you're staring straight ahead and that your partner is holding the paper strip in the corner of the board.",
        "Tell your helper when you first notice movement.",
        "Have your friend slowly slide the paper strip along the curved edge of the board.",
        "As soon as you're able to detect movement in your peripheral vision, let your friend know by saying \u201cOK\u201d or something similar.",
        "They should pause for a moment, then continue sliding the paper strip.",
        "If you want to keep a record of your results, have your friend quickly mark this point on the underside of the board with a pencil before proceeding further.",
        "Because of how peripheral vision functions\u2014relying more on the rods in your eyes that are sensitive to movement, rather than the color-sensitive cones\u2014you should notice that something is moving before you can make out its shape or color.",
        "Continue the test until you detect color and shape as well.",
        "As your friend continues to move the paper strip into your field of vision, indicate when you can see more details.",
        "For instance, say \u201cred\u201d and then \u201ctriangle\u201d when you see that they are using the red strip of paper with the triangular top.",
        "If desired, they can mark these spots with pencil on the underside of the board as well.",
        "Repeat the test on the other side and with the other strips.",
        "You can do the test as many times as you like, but consider doing it 3 times on each side to test your left and right peripheral vision.",
        "For a more accurate test regarding your perception of color and shape, have your friend use one strip of each color on each side, in random order.",
        "For instance: red triangle to your right; yellow rectangle to your left; yellow triangle to your right; green triangle to your left; red rectangle to your right; green rectangle to your left.",
        "Change the conditions of the test slightly, if desired.",
        "For example, you can reduce the light level in the room, give your eyes a few minutes to adjust, and repeat the test to see how your results compare.",
        "Or, you can write random letters or numbers on the strips and tell your friend as soon as you can read them."
