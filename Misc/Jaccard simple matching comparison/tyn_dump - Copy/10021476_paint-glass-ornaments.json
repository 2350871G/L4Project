After you've dried the ornament, reattach the top and hang it with the rest of your decorations. Creating Mercury Glass Ornaments Spray the inside of the ornament with spray paint. Remove the ornament's cap and hold the nozzle over the ornament's inside opening. Spray the ornament's interior until the entire surface is coated in spray paint. Although you can use any spray paint color, mirrored spray paint mimics mercury glass best. Swirl the spray paint around the interior. Holding the ornament in your hand, shake the ornament gently to spread any excess paint around the inside. This will prevent excess spray paint from pooling in the bottom and create a more even coat. Mist the inside with a water-vinegar solution. Fill a spray bottle with 1 part vinegar and 2 parts water. Hold the spray bottle's nozzle over the ornament opening and mist the ornament's inside until the surface is covered with small water droplets. You don't have to wait for the paint to dry before misting. Apply 2-3 more coats of spray paint and let the ornament dry.

Turn the ornament face down on a flat surface and leave it to dry for about 24 hours before using it as a decoration. Let each additional coat dry for 30-60 minutes before applying another one. Adding More Decorations Pour glitter inside for a sparkly look. Squirt a glitter adhesive inside the ornament opening and swirl it around the entire surface. Pour glitter in through the opening and, covering the hole with a paper towel, shake the ornament vigorously to spread the glitter. Add the glitter before painting the ornament if you want it to stand out more. Fill the ornament with pom poms, beads, or other decorations.

You can also use stencil letters to spell a message like \"Christmas 20--\" or \"Wishing you a happy wedding!\" Attach a ribbon to the top for easy hanging. After painting the glass ornament, loop a ribbon through the ornament's top. Tie the ribbon with a knot or bow to secure it tightly in place when you're ready to hang the ornament. Choose a ribbon color that matches the ornament or your decorative theme. Tie yarn around the ornament for a rustic, handmade flair. Glue one end of the yarn to the ornament and wrap it around the surface in one direction. After wrapping one side of the ornament, switch sides and wrap another area until you cover the entire surface in yarn. Glue down the other end of the yarn after wrapping to hold it in place. Choose a color that matches or complements the color you painted the ornament. If you painted your ornament red, for example, wrap it in green string.",
