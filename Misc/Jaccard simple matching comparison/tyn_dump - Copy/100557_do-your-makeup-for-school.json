BB creams are a good choice for your everyday makeup because they are moisturizing and light, but still provide some coverage. Use a small dab of product, about the size of a pea. With your fingers, gently spread the product onto the skin using upward strokes. Be sure to also smooth it over your jawbone, temples, and down your neck. Make sure that there are no streaks.

Apply this over your BB cream or foundation, or it will just be wiped away. If you want to cover up acne spots, use a green-tinted concealer first, then apply your normal concealer on top of it. The green will help hide redness. Only use this if you had about 3 hours of sleep. Use a very small dab of concealer to start with. You can always dab on more if you need to. Blend your concealer well. If you use your fingers to apply your concealer, gently dab it instead of smearing it. This is better for your skin and will keep the concealer where you want it. If you have dark circles under your eyes, apply a peach corrector right on top the dark areas, followed by a concealer that matches you skin tone and blend. To highlight, apply the concealer in a triangle shape. The triangle should point at your cheek, with the base beneath your eye. Apply a dab of concealer to your upper eyelid. This will form a base for eyeshadow and eyeliner. It helps prevent them  from bleeding and smudging later on in the day."

                    "description": "Choose a shade that is dark, but not too dark for your hair and skin tone. If you have dark hair and eyes, black or dark brown are good choices. If you have very light skin, blonde hair, and/or blue eyes, it is better to choose a lighter shade of brown. When applying tilt your chin up and point your gaze downward so that you can see your entire eyelid. There are the three main types of eyeliner. Each comes with its own benefits. Pencils are quick and easy to use, and are less easy to smear. Gel liners are applied with a brush and give you better control over the thickness of your eyeliner. Liquid liners are the most precise, but also the most difficult to use. If you are just starting out with makeup, it might be best to start with a pencil. As you become more experienced and comfortable with your makeup, you can try gel or liquid. Avoid pulling your lids tight, as this can result in crooked lines. For a simple and clean look, draw a thin line on your top lid, as close to the lash line as possible. For added emphasis on the eyes: On the lower lash line, draw a line from the outer corner to the middle of your eyelid. Do not completely circle the eyelid \u2014 this will make your eyes appear smaller. Save more dramatic looks, such as winged eyeliner for parties."

Gently wiggle the brush back and forth while drawing it through the tips of your lashes. If you want more control you can bend the wand so that the brush is perpendicular to the rest of the wand. To do this, simply bend the tip as you remove the wand from the vial. Apply one or two coats. Depending on how dramatic you want your lashes to look, apply one or two coats. However, be aware that the more you apply, the more likely you are to end up with clumpy looking eyelashes. Use a brow brush, which has a brush on one side and comb on the other to brush any clumps out. Use the comb side to tease apart any clumped lashes."

        "Again, for school, avoid very dramatic colours such as bright red.",
        "Try to go for softer shades such as peach.",

        "You don\u2019t have to carry around your whole makeup bag, but do include a few essentials.",

        "Keep a few tissues with you.",

        "For example, some are designed to prevent oiliness, while others keep your face moisturized.",
        "Choose the spray based on your skin type.",
