Discard the remaining zucchini \"stump.\" Once you\u2019re done grating, lift the box grater to reveal a mound of nicely-shredded zucchini. The sides of box graters have different sized teeth that produce finer or coarser shreds. For most recipes calling for shredded zucchini, grating on the side with the largest teeth will do. Some food processors with shredding attachments also do a good job on zucchini, but many end up creating uneven shreds and a lot of mushy pulp."

Then, pat the zucchini dry with paper towels or a clean towel until all surface moisture is removed. A wet zucchini will be slippery and more difficult\u2014and potentially dangerous\u2014to cut and grate. Cut off the top and bottom of the zucchini with a sharp knife.

Freezing Measured Amounts of Zucchini Fill your chosen size of measuring cup with shredded zucchini. Let your favorite recipes dictate how you want to portion out the zucchini. For instance, if you love making a zucchini-banana bread that uses 1 cup of zucchini, fill a 1 cup measuring cup. If you only need half-cup amounts for recipes, use a \u00bd cup measuring cup.

If you use a vacuum sealer instead of zip-close freezer bags, unblanched zucchini may last for up to 3 months in the freezer--the same as if you'd blanched them and used freezer bags. Thawing Zucchini for Use in Recipes Place the bag of frozen zucchini on the counter for 1-3 hours. 1 cup of zucchini will probably thaw fully in about an hour, while larger amounts (e.g., 2 \u00bd c) might take several hours. Squeeze the bag every half hour or so to see if the center of the shredded zucchini is still frozen. The zucchini may thaw more quickly if you place it under cool running water.

Or, wrap it in a piece of cheesecloth or a thin, clean kitchen towel and squeeze out the water with your hands. Most recipes that use fresh shredded zucchini recommend removing the excess water, and thawed zucchini will be even more watery. Use thawed zucchini in your recipe just as you would fresh.
