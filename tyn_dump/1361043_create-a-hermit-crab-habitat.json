        "Always place meat into the habitat at night and remove it in the morning to prevent flies or scavengers.",
        "Put your hermit crab habitat in safe and stable environment.",
        "Always keep your tank in a room that remains at an acceptable and steady temperature.",
        "This means away from vents that release cold air and away from windows and outdoor locations that expose them to direct sunlight.",
        "Keep your habitat away from pets and areas where you use cologne, hairspray, and room deodorants.",
        "Adjusting the Habitat for Land Hermit Crabs Place a fresh water dish and a marine salt water dish in the bowl.",
        "Provide your crabs with a dish of marine salt water and another with fresh water.",
        "Be sure they have access to both at all times.",
        "To create salt water, buy marine grade salt and mix 1 ounce (28 g) per 4 cups (950 mL) of water.",
        "Both water dishes should be free from ammonia, chloramines, and chlorine.",
        "Chlorine will blister your crab's gills.",
        "Always use a water conditioner that removes chloramines and heavy metals, as many homes have copper pipes and hermit crabs are especially sensitive to copper.",
        "Make sure the water dishes are at least as deep as your largest crab.",
        "It is not true that they will drown.",
        "Tupperware bowls or small paint trays work well.",
        "Give your smaller crabs a way to climb out of the bowl, such as small glass pebbles or uncoated river pebbles.",
        "Create a substrate of 5 parts growing medium and 1 part eco earth.",
        "Aragonite sand is the best choice for a growing medium, followed by coco fiber.",
        "Both of these materials can be found in reef stores.",
        "Coco fiber should be expanded with bottled water or dechlorinated water.",
        "Never use anything with cedar or any other conifer.",
        "Crushed coral is also a suitable substrate, although it's typically a more expensive option.",
        "Make sure the eco earth is dry when you mix it into your sand to prevent the substrate from waterlogging.",
        "Keep the humidity between 70 and 80 percent at all times.",
        "Install a hygrometer in the tank and monitor humidity daily.",
        "A moist substrate will help you keep humidity up.",
        "To keep it moist, poke a hole in each corner of the substrate and pour \u20444 cup (59 mL) of water into them every 3 to 4 weeks.",
        "Pour {{convert|1/2|cup|mL|adj=on|| of tank moss across the substrate to increase moisture.",
        "You can also place the cup into the tank to give your crabs a moss pit to hide in.",
        "Never use peat moss.",
        "Don't use sponges\u2014they harbor bacteria and can make you and your hermit crabs sick.",
        "Tailoring the Habitat to Saltwater Hermit Crabs Fill your tank with chlorine-free saltwater.",
        "Make sure you add \u00bd cup (118 grams) of sea salt for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.",
        "Mix the sea salt in thoroughly and wait until it dissolves and the water is clear.",
        "Wait 2 to 3 hours until the water is at room temperature before adding it to the aquarium.",
        "Purchase pre-mixed saltwater from pet stores.",
        "Keep the water pH between 8.0 and 8.4.",
        "Use pH paper to test the pH of your water daily.",
        "To increase pH, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baking soda for every 5 gallons (19 L) of water.",
        "To decrease pH, add peat moss.",
        "Buy pH paper and peat moss from pet stores.",
        "Test your water for nitrite and ammonia regularly.",
        "Dip ammonia into the water regularly to make sure levels are undetectable.",
        "Similarly, use nitrate strips to make sure levels are less than 10 ppm.",
        "Purchase both ammonia and nitrite testing papers from pet stores, big-box suppliers, or online stores.",
        "Keep the specific gravity between 1.021 and 1.028.",
        "Pour a sample of the habitat water into a container and insert a hydrometer.",
        "Once it stops floating, check the waterline and read the corresponding specific gravity.",
        "When specific gravity levels are too high, replace saltwater with freshwater 10 percent at a time to lower it.",
        "If specific gravity levels are too low, raise it by replacing up to 10 percent of the freshwater with saltwater at a time.",
        "Hydrometer scales read \"specific gravity,\" which is the ratio of the liquid's density to the water's density.",
        "Make sure replacement water is the same temperature as aquarium water.",
        "Don't alter specific gravity more than 0.001 per day.",
        "Anything more can cause shock to your hermit crabs.",
        "If necessary, adjust salinity over the course of 3 to 4 days."
