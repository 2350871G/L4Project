        "In the project shown here, that meant 1 centimeter (0.4 in) folded either two or three times, equaling 2-3 additional centimetres being added to each pattern piece.",

        "It is important to make sure that you plan which way the fabric's nap or material print direction will run for each piece you plan to cut out.",
        "For instance, the example shown first appeared to have no noticeable print or nap direction, however, when the fabric was turned at 90 degrees, the optical sheen changed from a warm tone to a cool tone.",
        "Try to picture in your mind which way you will be viewing each piece of the pattern piece before laying them out and cutting them.",
        "Be prepared for some basting.",
        "Basting and pinning each section is the best way to avoid fighting with holding pins or ending up with visibly uneven seems.",
        "The contrasting colour of the thread will make it easier to pull it out afterward.",
