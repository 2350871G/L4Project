Always use warm water and soap while you\u2019re washing your hands to help kill more bacteria. Lather the soap on your hands for at least 20 seconds, making sure you clean the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.

Then clean your hands after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, or handling garbage.Warning: Avoid sneezing or coughing into your hands since you\u2019re more likely to spread germs and bacteria. Use hand sanitizer if you aren\u2019t able to wash your hands. Look for a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol so it effectively kills bacteria and viruses.

Keep rubbing the sanitizer in until it completely absorbs into your skin. Hand sanitizer may not kill all germs on your hands. If you have the option, wash your hands instead since it will disinfect your hands more thoroughly. Use headphones to keep your phone away from your face. Opt for headphones that have a built-in microphone so you\u2019re still able to answer phone calls. Keep your phone in your pocket or on your desk throughout the day so you don\u2019t have to handle it as often. Whenever you take a phone call, put in your headphones so you don\u2019t have to bring the screen near your face. If you don\u2019t have headphones, hold your phone away from your mouth or use speakerphone to help reduce the spread of germs. Avoid bringing your phone in the bathroom if possible. Leave your phone in another room whenever you go to the bathroom. If you have to bring your phone with you, keep it in a pocket or bag the entire time. Don\u2019t touch your phone until you\u2019re finished in the bathroom and have washed your hands thoroughly.",
