Make sure your hair is clean before beginning the coiling process, washing it with your favorite shampoo and conditioner. If you've dried your hair, fill a spray bottle with water and use it to wet your entire head of hair. While your hair should be damp, make sure it\u2019s not dripping wet.

Blot your hair with a towel if necessary to ensure it\u2019s not dripping wet. Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair to help with detangling. Choose your favorite leave-in conditioner and follow the instructions on the bottle to apply it to your hair in an even layer. This will help lock in moisture and make it much easier to detangle your hair using a brush. Leave-in conditioners come in mist and cream forms. Comb out any tangles using a wide-tooth comb. Once your hair is damp, use the comb to gently brush out any tangles. Start combing the tips of the hair first, working your way upwards with the comb to make the process easier. It is especially important to use a wide-tooth comb if you have curly or afro-textured hair. This will help to prevent damage and breakage. Sectioning Your Hair Split your hair into 2 sections. Use the end of a rattail comb to create a line at the back of your head. This line should go down the middle of your head vertically to create the 2 sections. Hold each section in place using a hair tie or clip. Separate each section in half one more time. Once you have 2 main sections of hair, split each of these sections in half horizontally so that you\u2019re left with 4 sections of hair. Use clips or hair ties to hold each section separately. It\u2019s okay if the sections aren\u2019t equal\u2014they\u2019re only used to separate your hair into more manageable sections. Rub a curl enhancing cream or gel into the first section. While it doesn\u2019t matter which section you choose to start with, it\u2019s easiest to work from the back of your hair to the front. Undo the first section of hair and squeeze a quarter-sized amount of the gel onto your fingers before rubbing it into the entire section of hair thoroughly. Use a comb to brush the gel through the section of hair evenly if desired. Make sure you apply the gel to the ends of your hair to prevent frizz. Creating Coils Separate a 1 in (2.5 cm) square piece of hair from the first section. Opt for a smaller or larger piece of hair depending on how small or large you want your coils to be and depending on the length of your hair. If you have short hair, then your coils will need to be small, but if you have long hair, then you can do small, medium, or large coils. This strand will turn into your first curl. For example, for super small coils you might pull out 0.5 in (1.3 cm) sections of hair.

Wrap the first section of hair around your finger, starting super close to your roots as you create the spiral. This will ensure you get the fullest coils possible. Twist the coils as tightly or loosely as you'd like. Twirl and stretch the strand of hair until it coils when you let it go.
