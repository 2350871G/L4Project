Start painting in the center of the front cover and paint outwards from that spot to the edges. Repeat on the back cover and on the spine. Use long, even strokes so the paint is evenly distributed. If you want to cover up a dark cover or a design in order to paint something new, use white acrylic paint. If you're interested in just painting the book a new color to use as a design accent, choose whatever color you like best.Tip: To cover all the crevices around the spine, stand the book on end once you get to that point. This way you can close the cover a little bit and see the entire spine."

Apply a single coat to let some of the original cover peek through, or apply 2 to 3 coats to give it a solid finish.

An angle-tipped paintbrush or a round-tipped paint brush will allow you to create more detail in your painting. Rinse and dry off your paintbrush in between colors.

Wet your brush with water (use any kind of paintbrush you prefer) and dip it into a color on your palette. Try mixing different colors of paint together on the cover of the book to create different effects. Use more water for a more opaque color or less water for a more vibrant color. If you like watercolors but also want a mix of acrylic paint, try using gouache paint. Watercolors would look great on the cover or spine of a book, whether you wanted to paint an actual scene, like a meadow or a house, or whether you just wanted to experiment with different colors."

        "Oil paints take a lot longer to dry when compared to acrylic paint or spray paint, but because they take so long to dry, there's more time for you to modify your artwork.",
        "An angle-tipped paintbrush or a round-tipped paint brush will allow you to create more detail in your painting.",
        "Rinse and dry off your paintbrush in between colors.",
        "Oil paint is a bit harder to wash off of your skin or clothes and usually requires the use of some kind of oil, like baby oil or mineral oil.",
        "Oil paints are generally very thick and vibrant.",
        "Paint with watercolors to play around with color on the cover.",
        "Using watercolors lets you control how opaque or vibrant your painting will be.",
        "Wet your brush with water (use any kind of paintbrush you prefer) and dip it into a color on your palette.",
        "Try mixing different colors of paint together on the cover of the book to create different effects.",
        "Use more water for a more opaque color or less water for a more vibrant color.",
        "If you like watercolors but also want a mix of acrylic paint, try using gouache paint.",
        "Watercolors would look great on the cover or spine of a book, whether you wanted to paint an actual scene, like a meadow or a house, or whether you just wanted to experiment with different colors."
