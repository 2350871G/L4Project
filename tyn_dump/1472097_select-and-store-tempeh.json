It can be fried as slices, eaten as cubes in stews and stir-fries, crumbled into many different dishes from lasagna to casseroles, etc. Excellent for pureeing, crumbling, dicing, and slicing, strips of it can also be toasted or fried and placed into salads. The only thing to be careful about is the ease with which it absorbs oil, so simply brush it with oil rather than frying it in a depth of oil."
