        "Purchase one of these pre-made kits for each child so they have something new to learn while travelling.",
        "Obviously, you\u2019ll need to be selective about which kit to buy, as they\u2019ll be in a cramped location that may be bumping or jostling around.",
        "A soap making kit or even a jewellery making kit is likely not appropriate for the car or plane (but maybe okay at a hotel or a relative's house).",
        "Creating Travel Binders Collect or buy a small-sized binder for each of your children.",
        "The binder can be anywhere from 0.5 to 1.5 inches (1.3 to 3.8 cm) wide.",
        "Reuse or repurpose an existing binder or purchase a new binder at the dollar store or an office supply store.",
        "If you\u2019re able to find a binder with a clear plastic pocket on the front and pockets on the inside, even better (but not necessary).",
        "Travel binders could even be useful for teenagers or adults, as you can customize what you put inside.",
        "Personalize the binders for each of your children.",
        "Have your children help you personalize their own binders if you want.",
        "Print a cover for each binder that has your child\u2019s name on it and maybe the name of the trip you\u2019re taking (e.g., \u201cEuropean Vacation 2020\u201d).",
        "If your binder has a clear plastic pocket on the front, simply slide the cover page into the pocket.",
        "Otherwise, use tape or glue to attach the cover to the front of the binder.",
        "If your kids want to personalize their own binders, have them write their names with a permanent marker or add a variety of stickers they like to the outside.",
        "Add a binder pouch to the front of the binder.",
        "Binder pouches are pencil cases that are designed to go inside a binder.",
        "They typically have 3 grommet holes where the pouch can be secured within the rings of the binder.",
        "Place one that you\u2019ve purchased at the dollar store or office support store inside each binder.",
        "Alternatively, if you can\u2019t find a pencil case designed for a binder, you can duct tape a flat pencil case to the inside cover of the binder.",
        "The purpose of this step is to ensure the pencil case cannot get separated from the binder.",
        "Fill the binder pouch with appropriate writing instruments.",
        "At the very least, include 2 dry erase markers in each pouch and 2 mechanical pencils.",
        "If you include pencils, also remember to include an eraser.",
        "Include a set of coloured pencils if you plan to include colouring pages within the binder.",
        "Include a couple of pens for older children.",
        "You\u2019ll also want to include a small washable cloth in each pouch which can be used to wipe away the dry erase marker from the plastic sheets.",
        "Print a variety of travel game templates from your computer.",
        "Use an internet browser to search for \u201ctravel game templates.\u201d Download the templates that interest you and are appropriate for the ages of your children.",
        "You can also make your own travel games using word processing or spreadsheet software if you want.",
        "Alternatively, you can purchase a game or puzzle book from the book store or dollar store and cut/tear the pages out.",
        "Put 1 or 2 game templates in a plastic sheet protector.",
        "Sheet protectors are designed to go inside binders, as they already have 3 holes for the binder\u2019s rings.",
        "Plus, dry erase markers can be wiped off the outside of a sheet protector as it\u2019s made of plastic.",
        "Each sheet protector can include 2 games; one facing forward and the other facing backwards.",
        "If you\u2019ve included games that can only be played once, you don\u2019t need to put them inside a sheet protector.",
        "Add a map of your trip to the front of each binder.",
        "Regardless of the type of trip you\u2019re taking, use an online map program like Google Maps to find and print several maps that show your trip.",
        "Make sure to print a map that includes your route on it so your kids can follow along.",
        "Mark stops on your map so your kids can determine how long it will be until they reach the next stop.",
        "Include a country and/or world map in the binder so your kids can see their starting and ending points on a large scale."
