If you don't have the hoodies or shirts handy, you can probably find some at a thrift store, since you'll be messing with it anyway. Take the long sleeve black hoodie (or which ever garment you chose), and cut the sleeves of directly at the seam.  Take the green hoodie, and cut it's sleeves off directly at the seam.  Pin the black sleeves unto the green hoodie where the sleeves should be. Make sure the right sleeve is on the right side, and the left sleeve is on the left side. Using your sewing needle (or sewing machine), attach the black sleeves to the green hoodie, making the black sleeves the green hoodie's new sleeves. (If you are doing this by hand, use a looping pattern as opposed to an up 'n under pattern) Take the black yarn, and either sew or glue them onto the end of the black sleeves and the beginning of the green hoodie, to make it look like the pattern on GIR's hoodie. It should look like a rag doll type stitching pattern. Next, get your first piece of black felt, and using a piece of chalk, draw a large triangle shape into it.  Cut this piece out, and roll it like a cone. You can either glue or sew the sides of the cone together. DO NOT SEW THE BOTTOM JUST YET. Take your stuffing, and stuff the cone. This is GIR's tail. Take the tail, and glue it to the bottom back center of the hoodie where the tail should be.  Now take a large rimmed glass, or another circular object, and trace 2 large circles unto one of the pieces of white felt.  Cut the white circles out, and place them where GIR's eyes should be on the actual hood of the hoodie.  Take a quarter, and trace it's shape unto one of the pieces of black felt twice. Cut them out, and glue them to the center of the white circles. Take one of your eyes, and sew it a about a half of the way unto the hood. DO NOT SEW IT THE WHOLE WAY. Take the stuffing, and stuff a little bit of it under the eye. Continue sewing the eye on until you are about 2/3 of the way done. Now stuff the eye to the desired amount. Sew the rest of the way. Do the same for the other eye.  Take the black felt, and cut 2 6 inch long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick strips. Cut the tops at an angles like GIR's ears. Take pipe cleaners, and glue one to the back of each ear.  Bend the bottom of each ear so it looks kind of like an L shape. The bottom part of the L should only be 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) long. Sew the bottom of the L shape unto the hood where GIR's ears should be. Do the same for the other ear. Cut a strip of the pink felt 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) wide by 3 \u20442 inches (8.9 cm). This is the tongue. Take a line of the yarn, and sew or glue it down the middle of the tongue. Sew the tongue to unto the edge of the hood.  Cut a small triangle (about an inch long) and glue it between the eyes. This is the nose. Now take the thread, and going down the hoodie's back, glue 2 \u20442 inch (6.4 cm) strips down the back center from the tip of the nose, to the tail. Separate the strips by about an inch and a half. AND DONE! Your hoodie should be all done now! Feel free to try it on, and go crazy!>:D",
