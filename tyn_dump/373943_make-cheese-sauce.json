Hold a flat shredder over the paper 45 degrees to the surface. Place the cheese perpendicular to the shredder and, starting from the top, press downward on it while moving it toward the wax paper. Hold the shredder steady with one hand and firmly press the cheese down with your other as you drag it across the shredder. For parmesan and harder cheeses, hold the cheese 45 degrees to the wax paper. Afterward, drag a vegetable peeler from the top of the cheese down toward the bottom to scrape off larger shards. Use cold cheese whenever possible. As it sits it will lower to room temperature, which is ideal for when it's melted later. If you prefer to skip this step, purchase pre-shredded cheese."
