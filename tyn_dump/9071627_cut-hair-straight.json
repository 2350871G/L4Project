    "text": " Cutting Your Own Hair Comb your hair out so that it is free of any knots or tangles. You can start with dry or damp hair. This method is most recommended for those who have straight hair. If you have wavy or curly hair, make sure your hair is wet before cutting. Pull your hair back into a low ponytail. Part your hair down the middle. Pull it back into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck, then secure it with a hair tie. Make sure that the ponytail is neat and smooth, and that all you hairs are in the elastic. Tie another elastic a few inches/centimeters below the first one. Smooth your ponytail down as much as you can, then wrap another elastic around it. Depending on how long your hair is, and how short you plan on cutting it, you may need to add a third elastic below the second one. Adding elastics gives you control before and as you cut. Hold the ponytail between your fingers where you want to cut it. Make a V-shape with your fore and middle fingers, then close your fingers around the ponytail. Slide your fingers down to where you want to cut the ponytail. This will give you a slightly-rounded bottom edge. If you want to cut it straighter, you will need to slide your fingers further down so that you have room to make adjustments. Cut the ponytail below your fingers. Use sharp, hairdressing shears for this step. Do not use regular scissors. Cut slowly and carefully, a little bit at a time. Undo the ponytail and check the shape. Turn around so that your back is facing the mirror, and hold another mirror up in front of you. Your hair will either have a rounded bottom edge or a slight curve. If this is not straight enough for you, proceed to the next step. Remove the hair tie and part your hair down the center. Extend the part to the nape of your neck, like making pigtails. Drape the left side of your hair over your left shoulder, and the right side over your right shoulder. Keep the strands that were on the back of your head on the outer edges as much as possible. Pinch your hair between your fingers again. Choose a side to start with: left or right. Grab the hair from that side, then pinch it between your fore and middle fingers as you did earlier with the ponytail. Pull your fingers downwards, angling them slightly. Slide you fingers down the length of the hair section to where you want to cut your hair. Angle your fingers upwards slightly, so that your finger tips are pointing up towards your shoulder. This will allow you to cut the hair from the back of your head shorter; when you brush your hair out, it will be the same length.

Take the innermost strands from both the left and right sections. Note where the cut strand ends on the uncut strand with your fingers. Cutting Someone Else's Hair Start with wet hair. You don't have to wash the person's hair with shampoo and conditioner, but it needs to be wet. Have the person sit in a tall chair so that their hair is at a comfortable cutting level for you. Gather the top three-quarters of their hair into a bun. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a neat part, then pull the hair into a bun at the top of their head. Clip the bun out of the way, or secure it with a hair tie. Leave the bottom portion of their loose. Pinch a strand of hair from the bottom portion between your fingers. Make a V-shape with your forefinger and middle fingers. Close your fingers against a 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide strand. You can also use a rat-tail comb to measure out the sections.
