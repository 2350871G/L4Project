                    "description": "If you intend to keep more than 1 toad in the same tank, add 5 gallons (19 L) to the volume of the tank per extra toad. An adequately sized tank will probably be about 20 inches (51 cm) long, 10 inches (25 cm) wide, and 12 inches (30 cm) tall. For example, if you plan to keep 3 southern toads together in the same tank, the tank should be at least 20 gallons (76 L) in volume. The tank can be any ordinary aquarium or terrarium made of glass or molded plastic. Note that male toads tend to not get along very well, so you shouldn\u2019t keep multiple males in the same habitat."

Place 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of substrate on the bottom of the tank to give your toad enough soil to dig into. You can buy these types of substrate at any pet store that sells supplies for amphibians.

Place at least 3-4 pieces of decor in the terrarium for your toad to hide under and enjoy hopping on. You can buy these pieces of decor at most pet shops. Wash them with dish soap and hot water before placing them in the terrarium. If you choose to use natural objects from outdoors, just be sure to wash them before placing them in the tank.
