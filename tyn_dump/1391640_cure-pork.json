When you place the pork on the ramekin and the pork gives off liquid, the ramekin will keep the pork from curing in its juice. Coat the 5 pounds (2.3 kg) pork belly with the dry rub. Place the belly on a cutting board or platter and cover it with the dry rub mixture. Use your hands to firmly rub the mixture into all sides of the pork. Place the pork belly in the container and cover it. Arrange the pork belly in your storage container so it's propped up on the overturned ramekin. Put the lid on the storage container.

Remove the pork from the refrigerator and flip it over once every 2 days. Return it to the refrigerator and keep flipping it every 2 days for 1 week. Remove and rinse the cure off of the pork belly. After a week, take the pork belly out of the refrigerator. Rinse it with cool water so the dry rub washes away. Use paper towels to pat the cured pork belly completely dry. Place the pork belly in muslin and hang it for at least 1 week. Put the dry pork belly into a muslin bag and tie a knot at the end.
