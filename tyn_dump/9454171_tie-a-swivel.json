    "text": " Making a Simple Knot Make a loop and thread it through the swivel. Fold the fishing line back over on itself about 4 inches (10 cm) from the end of the line to make a loop. Then, thread the loop through the swivel. Push the swivel through the loop when making a basic knot. Wrap the loop around the line and tuck it through the hole that is created, as if you were going to tie a basic knot. Before you pull it tight, push the swivel through the original loop you made. Tighten the knot. After pushing the swivel through the loop, hold the swivel in 1 hand and the line in the other. Pull both ends firmly to tighten the knot. Trim the excess fishing line. Use scissors or a knife to trim the extra fishing line off. Be careful not to cut yourself! Using an Offshore Swivel Knot Loop the line through the swivel and twist the line. Thread 1 end of the fishing line through the swivel, then thread that same end back through the swivel to create a loop. Twist the loop once right above the swivel. Fold the loop back over the line. Take the loop above the swivel and fold it back over the swivel so it overlaps the line. Put the fingers of 1 hand where the loop meets the line to hold it in place. Push the swivel through the opening 3 to 6 times. Rotate or spin the swivel through the opening of the loop and line 3 to 6 times. Ensure the swivel makes a full rotation each time to create coils in the line. Pull the line to create the knot. Hold the swivel in 1 hand and use the other hand to pull the line tight. This will cinch up the knot and secure the swivel to the line. There won\u2019t be any excess that needs to be trimmed off. Tying the Improved Clinch Knot Thread the line through the swivel and double it back. Thread 1 end of the line through the eye of the swivel. Pull about 6 inches (15 cm) of line through the swivel then double it back against itself so it\u2019s folded over the swivel. Twist the line 5 to 7 times and thread the end through the loop. Leave about 1 in (2.5 cm) of space between the swivel and the twists to create a loop. Twist the line 5 to 7 times, then bring the short end of the line through the loop just below the swivel. Pull the short end and main line to tighten the knot. It can be helpful to moisten the short line so you can grip it easily. Pull both the short end and the main line to tighten the knot against the swivel, but be careful that the coils don\u2019t overlap. Trim off any excess line.",
