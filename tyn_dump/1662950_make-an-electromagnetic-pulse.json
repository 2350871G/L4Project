These components can be found at your local hardware store. The thicker gauge copper wire you use in this experiment, the more powerful your electromagnetic pulse will be. In the event an iron rod is not available to you, you can use a non-metal rod as a substitute. However, a non-metal rod will have a negative impact on the strength of your EMP. When working with electrical components that could be holding a charge, or when running an electrical current through an object, it is recommended you wear rubber gloves to prevent any errant shocks to yourself."

        "You'll want to attach your camera circuit face up so that the capacitor and its connection pathways aren't interfered with by the cardboard.",
        "Your cardboard mount for your camera circuit should have some additional space for your AA holder.",
        "Attach your electromagnetic coil to the end of your walkie-talkie antenna.",
        "Since current will be running through your coil to create your EMP, it's a good idea to double insulate your antenna by putting another small piece of cardboard between your coil and the antenna.",
        "You can then use your electrical tape to attach your coil to the cardboard.",
        "Solder your power source.",
        "Find the battery connector tabs on your camera circuit and connect them to the corresponding positive and negative ends of your AA battery holder.",
        "This can then be attached to a free space on your cardboard camera circuit mount with electrical tape.",
        "Connect your coil to your capacitor.",
        "The excess wire that you left at the beginning and end of your copper wire winding will need to be soldered to the electrodes of your flash capacitor.",
        "To control the flow of electricity between your capacitor and electromagnetic coil, you should tie in your electrical switch between these two components.",
        "You should wear rubber gloves during this portion of your EMP device assembly.",
        "Any remaining charge in your capacitor could shock you.",
        "Attach your cardboard mount to your antenna.",
        "Use your electrical tape to firmly attach your cardboard mount and its component to your antenna.",
        "You should attach your mount above the base of your antenna, which you should have already insulated with electrical tape.",
        "Find a suitable test object and location.",
        "A simple, inexpensive calculator is ideal for testing your handheld EMP device.",
        "Depending on the materials and technique you used in the construction of your device, the range of your EMP field may include only the immediate vicinity of your coil, or it may reach up to several feet around the coil.",
        "Any electronics caught in your EMP could be permanently damaged.",
        "Make sure you have chosen a location far enough away from electronics that you don't inadvertently do harm.",
        "You could be liable for any damage you cause with your EMP.",
        "Test your handheld EMP device.",
        "Check that the switch for your device is set to off, and then install your batteries into the AA battery holder on your cardboard mount.",
        "Grasping your EMP device by the insulated base of the antenna, like a Ghostbuster Neutron Wand, hold your electromagnetic coil toward your test object and flick your switch to the \"On\" position.",
        "If you are not confident in your knowledge or construction of electrical components, you may want to wear a pair of rubber gloves when operating your device, as an added precaution.",
        "If your device has successfully worked, your test object, and any other electronics caught in your EMP field, will not turn on.",
        "Depending on the kind of flash capacitor you have used, the voltage required to charge your capacitor will be variable.",
        "The approximate capacitance for a disposable camera should be between 80-160 microfarads, and the voltage will likely be between 180-330 volts."
