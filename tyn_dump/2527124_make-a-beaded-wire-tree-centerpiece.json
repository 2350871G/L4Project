Remove one wire from the bundle. Bend it in half as you smooth out the kinks in the wire, using the cloth. You can smooth the wire with your bare hands but it's easier on your fingers if you use a cloth. Adding the Beads Slide a bead onto the wire and center it at the bend. Cross the ends of the wire directly below the bead and twist the wires together tightly at least three times to secure the bead. Repeat this step with all the remaining wires. Varying the number of twists below each bead will make the tree less uniform and more interesting. Making the Branches Take 2 or 3 of the beaded wires and twist them together to make the first branch.  Add another beaded wire or another small branch to this to begin making the larger tree branches.  Repeat until all 90 beaded wires have been grouped into three large branches.  Making the Roots Separate the root wire into three groups. Twist each group together to begin forming the roots. Continue separating each root into smaller roots until you run out of wire to twist. Use the wire cutters to trim the ends of the roots. Bend or straighten the roots as needed so that the tree sits level.",
