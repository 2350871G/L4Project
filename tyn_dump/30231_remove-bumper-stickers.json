Removing dirt and grime from the bumper sticker will let the heat source penetrate faster. If you're using a damp rag, dip it in lukewarm water before wringing it out to remove excess water."

Put the hair dryer on the hottest setting and hold it roughly 6 inches (15 cm) from the bumper sticker, heating up the middle section of the sticker before the edges. Move the hair dryer back and forth instead of keeping it in one place to avoid damaging the surface. Holding the hair dryer too close to the bumper sticker may cause the paint to melt. If you choose to use a heat gun (which is hotter than a hair dryer), hold it roughly 1 foot (0.30 m) away from the sticker for 1-3 seconds until the sticker bubbles slightly. Heat the bumper sticker using a hair dryer for about a minute\u2014if you see the edges of the sticker starting to lift, it\u2019s ready."
