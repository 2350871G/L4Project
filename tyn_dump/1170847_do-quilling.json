The one downside of the slotted tool is that it creates a tiny crimp in the center of the paper where you slide the paper into the head of the tool. If this doesn\u2019t bother you then you should definitely try this tool when you are first starting out. Needle tool: This tool is harder to use but will result in an uncrimped (meaning it looks more professional) and perfect spiral."

Quillers use thin strips of colorful paper, curling them with their tools to form incredible designs.

Make sure it's nice and snug, then start twirling the tool away from you. The paper should wrap around the end of the quilling tool, making a coil. Keep twirling the paper until the whole quilling strip is twisted on the quilling tool. To try coiling with a needle tool or toothpick, get your fingers a little damp and then curve one end of paper strip around the needle (or other tool). Use your thumb and index finger to apply pressure and roll the paper around the needle."

Basic glue, such as Elmers, will work just fine for quilling. You could also try tacky glue, as it dries more quickly than basic glue.
