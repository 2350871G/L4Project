Pour the sugar water into as many bowls as you have food coloring choices. Add a drop or two of different food coloring to each bowl. Coloring the popcorn Divide the popped corn into as many bowls as you have food coloring choices.  Pour one colored sugar water over one bowl of popcorn.  Repeat for the remaining colored sugar water and bowls of popcorn.  Stir and toss to mix the coloring through the bowls of popcorn thoroughly. It's more fun if you have a helper to do this with. Air dry the bowl of colored popcorn before combining all the colors.  Serving the colored popcorn Use one large bowl to combine all of the colored popcorn. Mix well. Serve. You can either leave the large bowl out for everyone to share from, or you can serve in individual containers once the colors have been mixed. The latter method will require lots more dishes or boxes though!",
