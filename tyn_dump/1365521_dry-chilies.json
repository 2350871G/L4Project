Be aware that air-drying techniques only work in dry climates. Attempting to naturally air-dry in a humid climate can result in very moldy and soft produce. Drying Outside Use a sharp knife to slice your chilies in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Identify a time when your local forecast calls for hot and sunny weather over a span of at least three days in a row. You can use your local weather channel, online forecasts, or newspapers to determine the forecast. Place the peppers cut-side down onto a cookie sheet, and place them in direct sunlight. While outside is best, you can also put them in a windowsill if necessary. Dry the peppers in the sun for a minimum of 8 hours. Turn the peppers over, so the cut-side is facing the sun, and allow them to continue drying. Cover the cookie sheet at dusk with a clean bed sheet or towel to prevent bugs from attacking or eating your peppers. At first light the next morning, remove the sheet so the peppers can continue to dry. Remove the dried chilies from the sheet once you are able to break the chilies apart easily between your fingertips. Store them in a sealed container for future use. Drying in an Oven Preheat your oven to 175 degrees Fahrenheit (79 degrees Celsius). For a fan-forced oven, the temperature should be 40\u00baC. Place the peppers with the cut-sides down onto a cookie sheet. Only place them down in a single layer. The cookie sheet is best covered with a layer of taut muslin, with the chilies sitting on the muslin. Place the sheet in your oven.  Cook the chilies for around six to eight hours. You can choose to turn them once during the cooking process if you like, but it is not required. Once they start turning brown, they are dried. Be aware that drying time depends very much on the size of the chilies. Hanging Peppers Cut a long thread. You can use cooking,polyester or nylon thread and calculate how long will you need depending on how many chilies you have. Tie the stalks. Using the thread, tie the stalks close together as possible. You may also use a large needle and stitch their stalks together. Hang the pepper line in a well-ventilated room. Allow them to dry for a minimum of three weeks.",
