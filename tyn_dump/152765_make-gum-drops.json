Line it with foil and spray with unflavored cooking spray, or give it a light coating of grape seed or peanut oil to prevent the candy from sticking. If you're making more than one gum drop flavor, prepare several small pans this way. This recipe works as well with other types of pans; the only difference will be in the thickness of the finished candy. Use a larger pan for thinner gumdrops. You can also use small molds to make gumdrops in different shapes."

This recipe works as well with other types of pans; the only difference will be in the thickness of the finished candy. Use a larger pan for thinner gumdrops. You can also use small molds to make gumdrops in different shapes. Soften the gelatin. Place the gelatin in a pot with the 1/2 cup cold water. Stir it with a spoon, then let it sit and soften while you prepare the remaining ingredients. Make a sugar syrup. In a separate pot, boil the 3/4 cup water. When it comes to a boil, add the sugar. Stir it in until the sugar dissolves. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Combine the syrup and gelatin. Pour the hot sugar syrup into the pot with the gelatin. Place it over medium high heat and boil it for 15 minutes, stirring constantly. Creating Gum Drop Flavors Divide the gelatin mixture. Pour equal amounts of the gelatin into separate bowls. Use one bowl for each flavor/color combination you're making. Add color and flavor. Each bowl requires only about 4 drops of food coloring and 1/2 teaspoon or less of flavoring. Add a little at a time until the liquid meets your desired taste.

Finishing the Gum Drops Lift the aluminum foil from the pans or molds. Take the edges of the aluminum foil and pull up to lift the entire layer of candy from each pan. Set the foil on a hard, flat surface, such a cutting board. Cut the gum drops. Use a sharp knife, lightly oiled if necessary, to cut the candy into cubes. You can make the cubes even or cut the gum candy into fun shapes. Try using a pizza cutter to make the job go faster. Use a small cookie cutter to make interesting and festive gummy shapes.
