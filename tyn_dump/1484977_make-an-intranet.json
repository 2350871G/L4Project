Use network interface cards (NICs) to build the connection for your LAN. NICs are hardware that you can insert into the motherboards of your computers to add ports that will allow you to establish your network. Insert a crossover cable into the ports of the network interface cards. This cable allows your computers to communicate.

Some common options include an organizational chart, a staff directory, wiki pages, a calendar, frequently used and shared documents, and a message board. Draw out the sequence of your intranet pages on paper, including the homepage and the order of the pages as you want them presented in the menu on your intranet site. Design a menu representing the major pages on your intranet. The menu should appear on each page to allow users to navigate from page to page and back to the homepage.
