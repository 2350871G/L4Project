Push the pushpin through the paper and into the chopstick or pencil and it looks like a real pinwheel. If you leave room on the pushpin for the wheel to slide back and forth and you blow, it works like a real one. Garden decoration: These origami pinwheels look pretty in the garden. They'll last until it rains, or keep them sheltered. Cards: Glue the origami pinwheel to cards. Either draw a stick or glue on a thin stick to create a 3D pinwheel effect on the card. Or be imaginative and use the pinwheel to create other designs on the card, such as a windmill, a Ferris wheel, etc. Festive decorations: Tie a row of origami pinwheels together along a piece of string or ribbon and hang for festive effect. Try using different colors of paper for best effect, or use colors that are themed to the occasion. Gift boxes: Attach an origami pinwheel to a gift box as the \"seal\" or as a design feature. Pinwheels could also be attached to gift wrapping paper for a 3D effect."
