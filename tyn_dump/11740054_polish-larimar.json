Then, add about 2 or 3 drops of a mild dish soap. Stir the water until it\u2019s nice and soapy. Your regular dish soap will be fine as long as it isn\u2019t too harsh. Avoid any products designed to cut through grease. Fragrance-free soaps made for sensitive skin or cleaning baby bottles are always good options. Most types of jewelry can be cleaned with soap and water as well. Take advantage of the soapy water to wipe clean silver and gold settings, for instance, but don\u2019t use it on wood."

If you don\u2019t have a good, clean brush to spare, try using a microfiber cloth instead. If you want to make absolutely sure you don\u2019t end up scratching the larimar, purchase a baby toothbrush. Set it aside in a clean place for whenever you need to polish your jewelry."

Afterward, scrub it with a soft-bristled brush or cloth again. Stains will be much easier to remove. Metal jewelry can be cleaned this way, but don\u2019t soak anything that isn\u2019t waterproof, such as wood. Larimar has a tendency to turn a slightly darker shade of blue in water. If you\u2019re happy with the shade of your larimar, then continue to scrub it instead of soaking it."

If you don\u2019t want to soak the stone again, wipe it clean with a clean cloth dampened with a little bit of water. Once it\u2019s done, the stone should glimmer like it did on the day you bought it. Make sure your larimar is dry so the soap and water don\u2019t continue to soak into it. Any minerals or chemicals left could cause discolorations over time. After rinsing, you could apply a colorless oil, wax, or paraffin to fill in any scratches on the larimar. It usually isn\u2019t needed and is mostly done by people refining gemstones."
