    "text": " Making Your Salad with Crumbled Bacon Cook your bacon. Lay all your strips of bacon in a large skillet on the stovetop. Turn the burner to medium-high. Flip the strips over every now and then once they begin to sizzle. Cook for roughly 10 minutes, or until both sides have browned evenly. Drain and divide your bacon. First, remove the strips from the skillet and lay them out on paper towels. Let the towels absorb the grease. If necessary, transfer your bacon to new sheets of towels if the first batch soaks through. Once they\u2019re drained, set one strip aside from the others. Make your dry topping. Take the other seven strips and crumble them into bits. Place them into a sealable food storage bag. Add your sunflower seeds, then shake or flip your bag to mix the two ingredients until they appear evenly mixed. Set aside. Prep and mix your fruit and veggies. First, chop your head of lettuce into bite-size pieces. Next, dice your red onions. Finally, cut each grape in half. Transfer them to a large mixing bowl as you finish prepping each one, then stir to mix. Make your dressing. Take your last remaining bacon slice and crumble it up as you did with the others. Add your mayo, apple cider vinegar, sugar, and black pepper to a second mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Then fold in your bacon crumbles. Dress and chill. Pour your dressing over the grapes and veggies. Toss your salad so the dressing distributes evenly. Seal the bowl with its lid, plastic wrap, or aluminum foil. Place the bowl in the refrigerator and chill for approximately two hours so the flavors wed. Add dry topping and serve. Once the salad is done chilling, remove it from the fridge and unseal the bowl. Top it with your dry bacon-seed and stir to mix. Serve immediately before the dry mix grows soggy from the dressing. Beefing Your Salad Up with Pasta and Pecans Bake your pecans.
