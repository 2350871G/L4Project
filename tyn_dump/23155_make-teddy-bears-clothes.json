Add 0.5 in (1.3 cm) to each edge for the seam allowance. Identify how long you want to make your pants or skirt as well, and make another mark where you want the item to begin and end, adding 0.5 in (1.3 cm) to each edge for the seam allowance. Then, finish drawing your outline for the pants or skirt. For example, if you want the pants to stop about 2 in (5.1 cm) from the bottom of the teddy bear\u2019s foot, then make a mark at this location on the paper. If you want the skirt to come only to the middle of the teddy bear\u2019s legs, then mark this location. If you do not want to make your own pattern, you can buy one in a craft supply store or find a pattern online for the size of the bear you have.Tip: Baby clothing patterns may also work for your teddy bear depending on its size. You may also find more variety in baby clothing patterns than teddy bear clothing patterns."
