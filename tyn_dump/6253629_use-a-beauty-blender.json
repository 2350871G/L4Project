Before using it, make sure to dampen it under the sink so it's thoroughly saturated. That will cause the sponge to expand, so it won't soak up as much of your cosmetic products. You can use warm or cool water to dampen the Beauty Blender, but you may find your application more refreshing if you use cool water. If you don't have access to a sink when you're using your sponge, you can wet it with bottled water or even spritz it heavily with your favorite setting spray to dampen it."

You want it to be clean the next time you use it, so try to get in the habit of washing it after each use to ensure that it's always ready when you need it. Beauty Blender makes a liquid and a solid sponge designed specifically for washing your sponge. If you're on a budget, you can also wash your sponge with an antibacterial, fragrance-free dishwashing soap. A bar of antibacterial soap also works well for cleaning a Beauty Blender. To wash it, moisten the sponge with warm water and work some of the soap or cleanser into it. Create a lather, and keep washing until the water from the sponge runs clear. If there's a stain on your sponge that doesn't come clean from washing, soak it in a mixture of liquid soap and warm water overnight. If the makeup still doesn't come out of the sponge, try treating it with a thin oil, such as baby oil, before washing it. The oil can help break down the makeup that's trapped inside. Let your Beauty Blender sit out to air dry after you wash it."

        "To apply concealer or foundation under the eyes, around the nose, along the lips, or in another small areas, press the pointed edge of the Beauty Blender against the skin.",
        "You'll want to press a little harder than you would with the rounded edge to ensure that the makeup is completely blended into the skin.",
        "Wash the sponge after you use it.",
        "Because the Beauty Blender sponge is so absorbent, it can easily grow bacteria.",
        "You want it to be clean the next time you use it, so try to get in the habit of washing it after each use to ensure that it's always ready when you need it.",
        "Beauty Blender makes a liquid and a solid sponge designed specifically for washing your sponge.",
        "If you're on a budget, you can also wash your sponge with an antibacterial, fragrance-free dishwashing soap.",
        "A bar of antibacterial soap also works well for cleaning a Beauty Blender.",
        "To wash it, moisten the sponge with warm water and work some of the soap or cleanser into it.",
        "Create a lather, and keep washing until the water from the sponge runs clear.",
        "If there's a stain on your sponge that doesn't come clean from washing, soak it in a mixture of liquid soap and warm water overnight.",
        "If the makeup still doesn't come out of the sponge, try treating it with a thin oil, such as baby oil, before washing it.",
        "The oil can help break down the makeup that's trapped inside.",
        "Let your Beauty Blender sit out to air dry after you wash it.",
        "Blending Out Makeup with Beauty Blender Dot the makeup onto your face.",
        "It can be difficult to dab the Beauty Blender into certain products, such as a concealer in a tube with a wand applicator or a cream blush stick.",
        "In those cases, dot the makeup directly onto the skin in the area(s) where you want to apply it.",
        "Start by applying a small amount of the makeup, and only adding more if you need it.",
        "The sponge will blend out the product quite a bit, so a little can go a long way.",
        "Stipple the Beauty Blender over the makeup.",
        "Once the makeup is dotted onto your skin, bounce the damp sponge over the product to gently blend it into the skin.",
        "If you're concerned about the makeup spreading too far as you blend, use the pointed end of the Beauty Blender.",
        "Because the sponge will pick up some of the product as you blend it out, be careful not to press the Beauty Blender onto other areas of the face or you may transfer the makeup.",
        "Roll the sponge over the area to smooth the makeup.",
        "When you stipple makeup that's already on the skin with the Beauty Blender, it can sometimes look a little patchy.",
        "To get a flawless, even finish, roll the side of the sponge over the area to smoothe out any streaks or patches.",
        "Rolling the side of the Beauty Blender all over your face is an ideal finishing step to your look no matter how you apply your makeup.",
        "It will ensure that your makeup is fully blended, and there are no harsh edges or streaks.",
        "Just as when you use your Beauty Blender to apply makeup, make sure to wash your sponge after you've finished blending out your makeup so it's ready for your next use.",
        "Erasing Makeup Mistakes with a Beauty Blender Start with a clean, dry sponge.",
        "While you should always dampen a Beauty Blender to apply makeup or skincare products, that's not the case if you're cleaning up makeup mistakes.",
        "Instead, make sure that your sponge is clean but completely dry before you start.",
        "It helps to have an extra Beauty Blender -- one that you can use wet to apply your makeup and one that you can leave dry in case you need it to clean up mistakes.",
        "Drag the Beauty Blender over areas with too much color cosmetics.",
        "If you've applied too much blush or bronzer, wipe the sponge over the areas to help tone down the color.",
        "Because the sponge is dry, it will pick up more of the makeup and give you a more natural finish.",
        "Roll the sponge over areas with cakey face makeup.",
        "If you've applied too much foundation, concealer, or setting powder, you can use the dry sponge to help pick up some of the makeup.",
        "Roll the side of the Beauty Blender over areas that look cakey, and the sponge will remove the excess.",
        "You can use the same technique to smoothe out streaky foundation or lines around the edge of your face.",
        "Using the Specialty Beauty Blenders Apply skin care products with a white Beauty Blender.",
        "The sponge is also ideal for pressing skin care products into the skin to ensure that they're fully absorbed.",
        "For the best results, though, use the Pure Beauty Blender, which is white so it doesn't contain any dyes that might irritate your clean skin.",
        "Make sure to wet your Pure Beauty Blender before applying your moisturizer, serum, sunscreen, or other products just as you would when applying makeup.",
        "That way, you won't wind up wasting your skin care products because the sponge won't absorb as much.",
        "Use a black Beauty Blender to apply self-tanner.",
        "It can be difficult to apply self-tanner with a smooth, streak-free using your hands or even a large mitt.",
        "The sponge makes it easy to stipple the tanner into the skin for even color all over.",
        "Use the Beauty Blender Body Blender, though, which is black and won't be stained by the self-tanner.",
        "The black Beauty Blender is also ideal for applying dark bronzers and long-wearing foundation that might be difficult to wash out of the traditional Beauty Blender.",
        "Do detail work with a Micro Mini Beauty Blender.",
        "While the pointed end of the sponge is small enough to get into nooks and crannies, it doesn't always offer the precision you might need.",
        "The Micro Mini Beauty Blender is a better option because it's \u00bc the size of the original.",
        "Use it to apply concealer under the eyes, set undereye concealer with powder, or contour and highlight the face.",
        "You can also use a Micro Mini Beauty Blender to apply cream eyeshadow to your lids."
