    "text": " Preparing fresh chili peppers for salsas Know how to prepare fresh chili peppers. If using fresh chili peppers in the salsa, knowing how to peel them is an important part of the preparation process. There are two basic methods, one for those who have access to a gas flame and one for those who only have an electrical heat source. In both cases, be aware that the fumes from heated chilies can irritate your lungs, so do not inhale. Peel the chili peppers over the gas burner: Spear the chili peppers onto a long metal skewer. Turn on a gas burner flame and roast them over the flame. When the skins to blister and darken, remove them. Don't allow them to burn. Dry fry the chili peppers in a griddle pan. When the skins become scorched and blackened, remove the chilies. For both heated chili peppers, now place them into a plastic bag. Tie the bag up to trap the steam. Put the bag aside for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, take the chilies out of the bag and peel off the skin. The capsaicin in chili peppers can irritate your skin and eyes badly. Do not absent-mindedly wipe your eyes or pick your nose with your chili pepper covered fingers! Wash your hands with soap and water after finishing handling the chili peppers, or wear gloves. To finish preparing the chili peppers, slit the peeled chilies open and scrape out the seeds.  Chop up the chili peppers into small diced pieces and put to one side in a small bowl, ready for use.  Classic tomato salsa Assemble the ingredients and items needed to make the salsa.  Decide how hot you'd like the salsa to be. For a medium heat, use 3 chili peppers or use 6 chili peppers for a hot one. The method for preparation of the chilies is outlined above. Prepare the tomatoes. Chop the onion finely and add it to a bowl with the lime juice and rind. The purpose of doing this is to soften the onion in readiness for adding to the salsa. Peel the tomatoes. Cut a small cross on the base of each tomato. Place the tomatoes into a heatproof bowl. Pour boiling hot water over the tomatoes and leave them to soak for 30 seconds. Remove the tomatoes and plunge them into a bowl of cold water. Drain well, then peel off the skins. Dice the peeled tomatoes. Place the pieces into the salsa bowl. Add the soaked chopped onion and any lime juice and rind left.  Chop the cilantro (fresh coriander) finely. Add this chopped cilantro to the salsa mixture. Add the diced chili peppers and the sugar.  Mix everything together gently until you see the sugar dissolve. Aim to coat everything with the lime juice. Cover the salsa bowl. Place it into the refrigerator to chill and marinate for 2\u20133 hours. This will give the flavors time to blend well. Before serving, throw a few lime rind pieces on top to garnish. Serve with tortillas, corn chips, beans or rice. Jalape\u00f1o and lime salsa Assemble the ingredients and items needed to make the salsa.  Prepare the jalape\u00f1o pepper as outlined above. Simply chop the canned chilies. Milder salsa can be made by substituting sweet peppers for the jalape\u00f1o and chili peppers. Hotter salsa can be made by increasing the peppers and adding a finely chopped habanero pepper. Cut the tomatoes. Remove the seeds and then add the diced pieces to the salsa bowl. Chop the onion into small pieces.  Chop the cilantro (fresh coriander).  Mix all of the chopped ingredients together.  Add the crushed garlic clove, salt and pepper. Mix through. Pour over the lime juice. Mix well. Serve. This can either be chilled as outlined in the traditional salsa method above, or eaten straight away if you can't wait. It's delicious over enchiladas or tacos, or as a snack with tortilla chips. Chipotle salsa Assemble the ingredients and items needed to make the salsa.  Place the tomatoes, garlic and cilantro (coriander) into a blender or food processor.  Process until the ingredients become smooth. Add the onion, adobo marinade and sugar. Add the lime juice and salt (to taste). If you're using the cinnamon, allspice or cumin, add these now. Serve. This salsa is ready to serve immediately. If not cover it up and chill until it is ready to be served, remembering that it is best served fresh. Tropical fruit salsa Assemble the ingredients and items needed to make the salsa.  Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl. Add salt to taste (optional). Cover the bowl. Place in the refrigerator to chill until needed. Serve. This serves about 4-6 people and goes well with a meal needing a sweet, hot touch as a condiment. Salsa verde Assemble the ingredients and items needed to make the salsa.  Chop the fresh parsley, basil, mint, chervil and tarragon.  Chop the capers and cornichons roughly. However, if you find the capers are really small, there is no need to chop them. Put all the chopped ingredients into the salsa bowl.  Add the chives, spring onion/scallions, oil, mustard and lemon zest. Mix well but gently. Stir in the lemon juice at the end. Season to taste. Leave to sit for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the flavors to develop. Serve. Give the salsa a last stir before serving. This goes well with poached or grilled meats and fish. Cooked salsa Assemble the ingredients and items needed to make the salsa.  Prepare the chilies as outlined above.  Put the onions into the cooking pan. Add the tomatoes and sugar. Cook over a medium heat until thickened. Stir regularly. Remove from the heat. Add the garlic, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, lemon juice, olive oil and prepared chilies. Season to taste and leave to cool. Serve. Once cooled, it's ready to serve. Garnish with the lemon rind lengths.",
