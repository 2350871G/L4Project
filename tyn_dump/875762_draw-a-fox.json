Creating a Realistic Sitting Fox Start with a circle and a curved line extending from its bottom left. It should look like a balloon on a string that\u2019s caught in a light breeze, or perhaps a lollipop with an arched stick. The circle represents the fox\u2019s head, and the curve traces the path of its spine. Make the curved line about 3 times as long as the diameter of the circle. Sketch in the pointed ears and rounded snout on the circular head. Create a \u201cT\u201d shape that covers the bottom half of the circle. Double the length of the T\u2019s vertical stem by extending it below the circle, then sketch in a \u201cU\u201d shape for the muzzle that surrounds the lower half of the T\u2019s stem. Draw 2 tall, pointed arcs\u2014roughly the shape of wishbones\u2014for the ears. Imagine the circle as a clock face and place them at about the 10 and 2 o\u2019clock positions. Add another circle and curved line to outline the fox\u2019s body and rear thigh. In basic terms, draw a reverse image of the circle and curve that you started with so that the 2 curved lines connect the 2 circles. The lines should curve a bit like a pair of parentheses\u2014 ( ) \u2014while the lower circle should have a bit more of an oval shape. Don\u2019t center the rear thigh straight below the head. Rather, off-set it so it\u2019s roughly centered under the left ear. Use more ovals and lines to outline the tail and legs. For the tail, make an irregular oval that narrows towards the fox\u2019s front side and appears a bit squashed flat on top. Make it overlap and extend beyond the bottom half of the oval representing the fox\u2019s thigh. For the near-side front shoulder, draw a circle that\u2019s slightly smaller than the head and place it right between the 2 curves that outline the body. Extend a line down from the circle at about a 30 degree forward angle, then draw a parallel line that extends from the curved line that represents the abdomen. The two parallel lines establish the positioning of the fox\u2019s front legs. Thicken the legs and add triangles for the front paws. Sketch in a pair of parallel lines on either side of each of the lines you just drew for the legs. Each leg should be about two-thirds as thick as the diameter of the upper shoulder circle. Sketch in a triangle at the bottom of each leg to outline the front feet. Sketch in the face and create a jagged outline to represent fur. Go around the smooth outline of your fox and add in jagged lines where fur would likely be tufted\u2014for instance, along the chest and spine, inside the ears, around the tail, on top of the thigh, on the underside of the shoulder, and on the paws. Then, use the T shape on the face to guide your placement of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Draw in 2 football-shaped eyes that are attached to the underside of the horizontal line of the T shape. Center the circular nose inside the U-shaped muzzle. Make the mouth a simple horizontal line across the bottom quarter of the muzzle. Darken your detailed lines with pen and erase your penciled-in sketch lines. Go back over the jagged lines you made for the fur, and darken and add further detail to the facial features, the paws, and any other areas that need further refinement. Once you're done penning in the features, erase all unnecessary pencil lines. Add some color to your fox drawing if you wish. Foxes are often a \u201cburnt orange\u201d color, but they can also be more red, orange, or brown. Choose the fur color that you prefer. Foxes have off-white areas of fur as well, such as the insides of the ears, the bottom half of the muzzle, the underside of the neck and front of the chest, the rear third of the tail, and (sometimes) the paws and the bottom halves of the legs. Drawing a Cartoon Fox Sketch in the head as a large egg-like shape centered on the page. Tilt the egg on its side\u2014for instance, so the narrower part of the egg\u2019s oval is pointed to the left. Since this is a cartoon fox, feel free to make the head big! {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/c\\/c2\\/Draw-a-Fox-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/c\\/c2\\/Draw-a-Fox-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":377,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":622.2996515679442,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\nSketch lightly with a pencil so that you can erase any mistakes or extra lines at the end. Draw the ears with 2 smaller egg-like shapes on top of the head. Imagine the head as a clock face and place the ears at about the 12 and 3 o\u2019clock positions. Make the far-side ear \u201cegg\u201d point straight up, and the near-side ear lean towards the fox\u2019s (soon to be drawn) tail at about a 30-degree angle. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/7\\/7b\\/Draw-a-Fox-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/7\\/7b\\/Draw-a-Fox-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":411,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":678.7586206896551,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Make an oval for the body that\u2019s about the same size as the head.

If you want the head to be larger than the body, go for it! Sketch in 3 pairs of ovals for 2 front legs and a rear leg. For the legs, space out 3 upright ovals fairly evenly across the bottom of the body oval. Roughly the top half of each leg oval should overlap the body oval. Add 3 smaller horizontal ovals at the bottoms of the legs to represent the feet. These should overlap the lower legs by about half. There are only 3 legs visible due to the viewing angle for this cartoon fox In other words, the far-side rear leg is hidden behind the near-side rear leg. Add a cloud-, thought bubble-, or bean-shaped tail. It\u2019s a bit hard to describe the shape the tail should have\u2014perhaps it\u2019s a question mark-shaped balloon filled with too much air! Anyway, extend this curvy tail off the rear-end side of the body oval, overlapping it only slightly. Make the tail nearly the same size as the head and at about the same level. Define the features of the fox within your rough outline. For instance, give the tail more of an upward curl within the outline you just made. Likewise, define the insides of the ears and the toes on the paws. Add a curved \u201cdent\u201d to the top front of the head oval to help define the muzzle, then sketch in a smiling mouth and a rounded nose and eyes. Since this is a cartoon fox, there\u2019s lots of room for individuality here. You can make your fox look a bit more human, a little more realistic, or any other way you like! Darken the finishing lines and erase your original sketching lines. Go over the features you just created with a pen or marker to make them permanent. After that, use an eraser to get rid of any excess pencil lines from your original sketching. Color your cartoon fox to finish it off. \u201cBurnt orange\u201d is a good color choice for a fox, but you might want to give a cartoon fox more of a reddish color. Add in some off-white areas on the chest, muzzle, lower legs, paws, and tail.",
