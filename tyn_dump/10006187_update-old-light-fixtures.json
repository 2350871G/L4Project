                    "description": "Line the bottom of your box with foam so you can easily move your fixture by dragging the foam's corners. Foam also gives your fixture a soft floor that won't scratch it. As you paint, you can continuously rotate the foam so that you get all sides of the fixture. Pebble style foam is ideal because the spray paint won't melt it. This kind of foam typically comes packaged with TVs and knock-down furniture. Styrofoam can easily melt if the spray paint is applied too close to the surface of the foam. Use light coats of paint to minimize the chances of your foam melting."

Stick one side of the stick or pick into the foam, and then rest your fixture on the top end. Use the stick to rotate and move your fixture without touching it. As another option, you can hang the light fixture from a wire, which makes it easier to spray paint the light fixture from every angle. For example, you might hang the light fixture from a long tree branch or a beam in your garage."

If your fixture falls into this category, place the piece into a sink basin and cover it with hot water. This will expand this coating and, once cooled down, it will be easy to peel off. If your piece is small enough, you can boil it in hot water for 2 to 3 minutes using a non-aluminum pot."

Both white and cider vinegar can effectively clean your light fixture, but cider types leave a pleasant smell.
