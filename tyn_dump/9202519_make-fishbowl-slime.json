As this is one of the few exact quantities needed to make slime, you can multiply, divide, or halve this as you want to change the amount of slime you\u2019ll make. Make sure you always use equal quantities of glue and water. Make sure the glue you use specifies that it is PVA or polyvinyl acetate somewhere on the container. Other glues may not work with your slime activator, which will prevent the slime from forming. PVA glue should be available online or at your local craft store."

Once you activate the slime, you can knead your 2 colors together to make some rainbow fishbowl slime. Use blue food coloring to make fishbowl slime that looks like the water in a fishbowl!

Try adding some blue, silver, and green glitter to make your slime look like water in a fishbowl! Use red and gold glitter to give your slime a fiery look. Opt for some holographic glitter or glitter in interesting shapes to make your slime even more unique!"
