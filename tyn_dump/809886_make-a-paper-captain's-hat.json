If you want a hat that is slightly wider than it is tall (or taller than it is wide,) then begin with a rectangular sheet of paper. The sizing, however, is still important! Making a shallower, wider captain's hat is a great way to make an 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper into a hat for a slightly larger head. Consider the color of hat that you want. Try using black paper for a pirate captain's hat. Use colorful construction paper for a more cheerful captain's hat! Remember that you can always color or paint the paper."
