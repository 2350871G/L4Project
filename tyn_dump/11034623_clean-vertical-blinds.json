        "The pillowcase will help prevent the edges of the blinds from fraying or getting caught in the machine.",
        "Check your blinds\u2019 label to see if they\u2019re safe to wash in a machine.",
        "Many fabric vertical blinds can be washed like regular laundry.",
        "You can also use a laundry bag with a zipper if you don\u2019t have an extra pillowcase.",
        "Add a gentle liquid detergent.",
        "Look for a laundry detergent that\u2019s labeled as gentle so it doesn\u2019t damage your fabric.",
        "Use the amount listed on the packaging, and pour it into the compartment if it\u2019s a front-loading machine or directly in the drum if  it\u2019s top-loading.",
        "Set the washing machine to a delicate cycle with warm water.",
        "Select the cycle made for delicate fabrics or on the lowest setting so it doesn\u2019t damage the blinds.",
        "Then change the water temperature to warm so the detergent works well.",
        "Close the machine and run the cycle in its entirety.",
        "Avoid using the hottest cycle since it could cause damage to your blinds since some fabric blinds have glue that could break down when it\u2019s heated.",
        "Let the blinds air-dry after they\u2019ve been washed.",
        "Put out a layer of towels on your floor or on a table that can hold the blinds.",
        "Take the blinds out of the pillowcase and lay them flat on the towels so they can dry.",
        "Leave them for a few hours until they\u2019re dry to the touch.",
        "You could also hang the towels back on their hooks if you don\u2019t want to lay them on the floor."
