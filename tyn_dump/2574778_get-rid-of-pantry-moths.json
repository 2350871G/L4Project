        "If you have plastic food containers or glass jars currently in your pantry, remove the contents, and wash them in a dishwasher or use hot water and dish soap to clean them out thoroughly.",
        "Make sure that you use a scrubbing brush to get them fully clean.",
        "This is an essential step if the containers were exposed directly to the pantry moths, but even if there were no pantry moths inside the container, it is still a good idea to temporarily remove the contents of the container and wash it.",
        "Doing so will also allow you to more closely examine the contents for evidence of infestation.",
        "Dry the pantry and all of the washed containers thoroughly.",
        "Before putting everything back into the pantry, dry the inside of the pantry with clean dish towels or paper towels.",
        "Make sure that there is no moisture left on any surface.",
        "Make sure that you dry the walls and doors of the pantry too.",
        "Preventing Further Infestations Place bay leaves in the corners of your pantry or cupboard.",
        "You can also tape them to the walls or the undersides of your shelves.",
        "You can also add a bay leaf directly to your container of rice, flour, or other dry food.",
        "The bay leaf won\u2019t affect the quality of the food, but if you would rather not chance it, you could tape the bay leaf to the inside of the lid and still achieve the desired effect.",
        "Note that there is no definitive scientific evidence to support this practice, but there is no definitive proof to discredit it, either.",
        "It may only be a \"folk remedy,\" but it is one that many seem to agree on.",
        "Store all new dry foods in airtight containers.",
        "Use plastic, glass, or metal containers to store freshly purchased flour, rice, and other foods.",
        "This will help to prevent reinfestation of pantry moths.",
        "Storing food in airtight containers also means that if you happen to purchase any infested foods, that the pantry moths won\u2019t spread to other foods and will be trapped in the container.",
        "Freeze new dry goods for 1 week to prevent repeat infestations.",
        "In the event that you purchase goods with moth eggs already inside, freezing the food for 1 week should effectively kill the eggs.",
        "At this stage, they will be harmless and virtually impossible to spot with the naked eye.",
        "Inspecting Your Pantry for Signs Look for adult moths or larvae.",
        "Adult moths are generally gray with hints of either red or white coloring, and they measure roughly 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) long.",
        "Larvae are about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) long and look like worms with 5 pairs of legs.",
        "The easiest way to spot a pantry moth problem is to actually see an adult moth flying around your pantry.",
        "This usually happens at night rather than during the day.",
        "If you suspect that you may have a pantry moth infestation, check all the dry food in your pantry.",
        "Moths hide out in flour, cereal, rice, and other grains most often, but you should also check pet food, dried fruit, or any other dry food products.",
        "In short, check everything.",
        "Check your pantry for cocoon webbing.",
        "Look in the corners and along the inside edges of the cupboards for clumps of stringy or grainy material.",
        "Pantry moths leave webbing almost everywhere that they crawl, and it is within the cocoon that they can lay hundreds of eggs.",
        "Cocoon webbing is usually found behind where a shelf meets a wall or beneath shelf paper.",
        "Inspect your dry food packaging for holes.",
        "Small holes appearing in dry food packaging that you haven't created are an easy way to tell if your home has pantry moths.",
        "Check all boxes, bags, and plastic wrapping for signs of these pests.",
        "The holes won't always appear only once the food is in your home.",
        "Food is sometimes sold already contaminated with pantry moths, so check all packaging before you purchase your groceries."
