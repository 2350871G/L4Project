            "description": "Making the applesauce will allow you to control the amount of sugar and preservatives, resulting in even healthier baking. To make your applesauce, wash, core, and quarter 2 lb. (908 g) of apples. Put them in a large pot filled with water that is at least an inch (2.5 cm) deeper than the apples. Boil until the apples are soft. With a bit of cooking water or unsweetened apple juice, put them through a blender or food mill. Add 1 tsp. (2 g) of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. For baking purposes, use unsweetened applesauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (96 g) of sugar or 1/3 cup (113 g) of honey to homemade applesauce, if you plan to eat it on its own. Reduce the amount of sugar you use in a recipe if you are using sweetened applesauce."
