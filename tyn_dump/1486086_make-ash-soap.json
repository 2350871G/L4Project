Ash, hickory, and maple are all great choices for hardwood, but you can also use others. Avoid softwood, like pine; it won't make good lye for bar soap. You may be able to buy the ashes online instead of burning them yourself. Make sure that they come from hardwood and don't contain any pieces of black charcoal."

In this case, just peel it off. Cut the soap into \u20442 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick slices. You can use a special soap cutting knife for this, or you can use a regular knife instead. If you pour the soap into individual molds, then you don't have to cut them since they are already a convenient size. Let the soap cure on a rack for 2 to 6 weeks in a cool, dry spot. Halfway through the curing process, about 1 to 3 weeks, flip the soap bars over. This will help ensure that they cure evenly on all sides. Wrap the soap in plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container. Keep the soap in a cool, dry place. Too much warmth or moisture may cause the soap to melt. Homemade soap, including ash soap, can last indefinitely, although it may shrink and harden over time. If you used essential oils, you may notice the fragrance fading after about 1 year. This does not affect the soap itself, however.",

        "Cover the mold with a towel, then remove it the next day.",
        "This is important because it will slow down the cooling process.",
        "If you let the soap cool down too fast, it may turn brittle and develop cracks.",
        "During this time, keep the soap some place warm and dry where it won't get bumped or moved around.Don\u2019t stop at just 1 towel.",
        "You can layer several towels or blankets on top of the mold as well!",
        "Wait 1 week for the soap to harden before demolding it.",
        "Continue to store the soap some place warm and dry where it won't be disturbed.",
        "Once the soap has hardened, take it out of the mold.",
        "How you do this will depend on how your mold is constructed.Some molds need to be taken apart in order to get to the soap.",
        "Other molds simply have to be turned upside-down, like a cake pan.",
        "You can cut the soap a few days earlier while it is still in the mold.",
        "It will be soft and thus easier to cut.",
        "If you lined the mold with wax paper, it may get stuck to the soap.",
        "In this case, just peel it off.",
