Tailor the event report for the needs and interests of each sponsor and audience. Consider the objectives of the sponsors. To some degree, sponsors are the key audience for an event report. They want to know whether it was worth sponsoring the event. So consider what they will want to know and what their hot buttons are. Tailor the event report to also meet the specific needs of the uniqueness of the event and sponsors. Don\u2019t write a color-by-numbers report.
