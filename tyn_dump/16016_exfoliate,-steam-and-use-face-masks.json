Rinse off the cleanser with lukewarm water. You can pat your face with a clean towel so it\u2019s not dripping but it\u2019s not necessary to dry it completely. You want your skin to be slightly damp when you exfoliate. For oily skin, choose an oil-free gel or foaming formula that will remove excess oils and deep clean your pores. For dry skin, choose a cream or oil-based formula that will cleanse your skin without stripping it of moisture. For sensitive skin, choose a fragrance-free, non-irritating cream formula. For acne-prone skin, choose an oil-free formula with acne fighting ingredients, such as salicylic acid."

Opt for a facial scrub that contains gentle microbeads rather that crushed fruit or nut shells. It will be less likely to irritate your skin. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you can exfoliate two to three times a week. If you have normal or combination skin, you can exfoliate up to two times a week.
