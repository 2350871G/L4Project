First focus on removing the excess ink using a dry towel or a paper towel to absorb the excess liquid. Blot the ink spill gently, putting a little to no pressure on the area. Try to remove as much ink as you can working from the outside towards the center. This will prevent the stain from spreading. Don't rub or scrub the area, which can spread the stain and work it into the fibers more deeply. Instead, blot gently to get as much of the ink out as possible before you clean it more deeply."

First, test the alcohol in an inconspicuous place of the car upholstery to make sure that it won't damage the upholstery material. Apply rubbing alcohol on a clean white cloth. Do not pour alcohol directly on the stain. Dab the ink stain with the cloth carefully and gently. Do not rub or wipe. Rubbing will cause the stain to spread. Repeat the process again until the cloth is not absorbing any more of the ink. Make sure to change the cloth when it is saturated with ink. Don't use alcohol on acetate, rayon, or triacetate. These fabrics will stain and leave bleach-like spots if treated with alcohol."
