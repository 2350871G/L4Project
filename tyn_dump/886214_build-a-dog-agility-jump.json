Using the saw, you will want to cut along the lines that you marked on the pipe until you have 16 individual pieces of PVC pipe. When cutting the pipe, you should place the PVC pipe in a vise or hold it in place with a clamp. When operating a circular saw, you should always wear eye protection and keep your fingers away from the blade. A miter saw and box may will give you more control over your cut, making it more accurate. You also do not need a clamp or vise since the miter box will hold the pipe in place. If you use a hacksaw, always secure your pipe within a vise or with a clamp. This will help prevent you from cutting yourself."

        "You should not need to take off more than a quarter of an inch (6.35 mm).",
        "Build the feet of the jumps.",
        "Slide two 12-inch (30.48 cm) pieces into the top and bottom ends of a tee joint.",
        "Then put caps on the ends of the 12-inch (30.48 cm) pipe.",
        "Repeat this process three more times to make all four feet for your jumps.",
        "If the pieces do not slide together easily, you might consider using a hammer and block to tap them together.",
        "Construct two bases.",
        "For each foot, insert a 1\u00be-inch (4.45 cm) piece into the open end of the tee joint.",

        "You can also make your own.",

        "One of the easiest ways to get your dog to go over the agility jump is to stand on the other side with a treat.",
