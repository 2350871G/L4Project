Play around with different combinations, but make sure that they look nice together. Pin the bandanas together with the right sides facing in. Place the first bandana down, right side up. Place the second bandana on top, right side down. Make sure that the edges and corners match up, then pin them together using sewing pins. If you want the hems visible as part of the design, pin the bandanas with the wrong sides facing in. Sew along the edges, but leave a gap. Use a sewing machine and a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance to sew along the top and both of the side edges. Sew along only half of the bottom edge. Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. You do not need to serge or finish the inside hems. Turn the pillow case inside out. Use something pointy, but blunt, like a pencil or knitting needle to help push out the corners. If you are leaving the hems on the outside, skip this step. Insert a 20-inch (50.8-centimeter) pillow. A pillow form will work the best, but you can use an old throw pillow as well. You can also fill the pillowcase with polyester stuffing instead. Sew the opening shut. You can do this by hand using a ladder stitch. If you left the hems on the outside, you can carefully topstitch the opening shut instead, but be careful not to catch the pillow inside! Tying a Bandana Pillow Find two 22-inch (55.88-centimeter) bandanas. You can use matching patterns or colors, or contrasting ones. You can even use a solid-colored bandana and a coordinating patterned one. Cut 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) squares out of each corner. Stack the bandanas with the wrong sides facing in and the right sides facing out. Trace a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) square onto each corner. Cut the squares out with sharp fabric scissors. Be sure to cut through both bandanas at the same time. Cut a fringe into all four edges. The fringe needs to be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) deep and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Be sure to cut through both bandanas at the same time. This ensures that the tassels are even. Tie the first top and bottom tassels together into a square knot. A square knot is similar to a double knot: cross the left strand over the right one and knot it, then cross the right strand over the left one, and knot it again. If you can't do a square knot, you can do a double knot instead. It won't be as durable, however. Tie the rest of the tassels together until you complete three sides. Always tie the top tassel to the matching bottom tassel. Do the entire bottom edge and both of the side edges. If you are using pillow stuffing, tie all of the tassels together except for the last five on the top edge. Insert a 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) pillow form. You can also use an old throw pillow that is a similar size. The pillow will fit snuggly into the bandana. You do not need to turn the pillow case inside out; the tied fringe is part of the design! If you can't find a pillow form, insert pillow stuffing or polyester stuffing. Finish tying the tassels together. Make sure that there are no gaps between the two bandanas.

Trace a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) square onto all four corners, then cut them out. Make sure that you cut through both bandanas at the same time. Cut a fringe into all four sides. The tassels need to be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide and 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) deep. Again, make sure that you cut through both bandanas at the same time. The tassels must match up.
