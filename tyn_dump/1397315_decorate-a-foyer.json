Try choosing colors that lead well into the rest of the house. A great way to do this is to use a blend of interior and exterior paints. For example, if the outside of your house is gray and the inside is marigold, try using both colors.

Just make sure you have enough room to hang the chandelier or light at least 6\u20198\u201d above the floor. If you can't, the room may appear smaller and crowded. If you don\u2019t have the space for a chandelier or pendant light, or you are renting and can't install a ceiling light, try a table or floor lamp. You can go with a simple design or choose a decorative piece. For example, an antique, hand-painted, glass lamp is a beautiful addition to any room. You can also try track lighting, which works particularly well in long hallways. It also keeps everything off the floor so you have more space."
