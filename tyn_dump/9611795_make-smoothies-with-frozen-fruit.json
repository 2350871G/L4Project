Add 1 frozen sliced banana or mango. Blend the smoothie on HIGH for up to 1 minute. Put the lid on the blender and turn it on to completely blend the tropical fruit smoothie.

Pour and serve the creamy tropical fruit smoothies. Remove the lid from the blender and pour the smoothie into 2 tall serving glasses. If you want to garnish the smoothies, sprinkle a little toasted coconut over them before serving. Avoid storing the smoothies because they'll separate as they sit.

For a little flavor and crunch, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (10 to 20 g) of chia seeds and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground ginger. If you want to use fresh ginger instead of dried ginger, use 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of grated ginger root. Add the frozen banana, fruits, and coconut oil. Put 1 frozen sliced banana into the blender along with 1 cup (150 g) of frozen fruit and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of coconut oil.

Use a combination of your favorite nuts such as almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, or pecans. Blend the smoothie for 1 minute. Put the lid on the blender and blend the ingredients until they're completely smooth. If you want a thinner smoother, pour in another 1/4 cup (60 ml) of milk, soy milk, or apple juice and blend the smoothie again. Pour the smoothies into glasses and drizzle them with honey, if desired. Divide the smoothie mixture between 2 tall serving glasses. If you want to make the smoothies sweeter, drizzle a little honey over the tops just before you serve them. Avoid storing the smoothies because they'll separate.
