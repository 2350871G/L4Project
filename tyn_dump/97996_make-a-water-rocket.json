It is also an important decorative element in making your water rocket look recognizably like a rocket, so be sure to pick out a color paper or spray paint you like. Draw a circle about 1\u2019 in diameter. The measurement doesn\u2019t need to be precise, as you can make adjustments later. The simplest way to do this is to find a bowl of about the right size, place it upside down on the piece of paper, and trace it. Cut out the circle, and cut a straight line from the outside to the approximate center of the circle. Again, precision isn\u2019t particularly important, just estimate where you think the center is. Slide the cut edges over each other to create a cone shape. Hold it over the cone to figure out the right size, and then tape or glue the paper together so it holds that cone shape."

Just make sure it is the right width for the bottle rocket to be able to sit snugly on it, with the neck of the bottle (the bottom of the rocket) facing down. This will serve as a launch pad for your rocket. Duct tape a dowel or garden stake to the side of the can.

Launching the Rocket Put water in the bottle and seal it. Fill the bottle to about 1/3 of the way full. Insert the cork (already attached to the pump) into the mouth of the bottle.
