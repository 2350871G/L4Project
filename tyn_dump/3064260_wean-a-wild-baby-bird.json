Search online or look through wildlife books to find out the bird\u2019s natural diet, or ask your veterinarian if you\u2019re still not sure. For instance, cardinals eat seeds, songbirds need a combination of insects and plant foods, and gulls or terns need crickets and small minnows. If you\u2019re not sure what type of bird you have, consult a field guide or contact a wildlife rehabilitator. In many cases, you can feed the baby bird softened dog or cat food, as long as it contains 30-40% protein."

                    "description": "While it might seem like holding back formula will encourage the baby bird to start trying solid food, this can actually make weaning harder. When baby birds are hungry, they seek comfort and food from their mother. If the baby is well-fed, however, it will feel more confident and secure, and will be more likely to try out some of the new foods that you introduce. Try offering a little solid food right after a formula feeding to encourage the baby bird to try it."

                    "description": "In most cases, if a baby bird is featherless or still very fuzzy, it probably needs to be hand-fed, since its mother would likely still feed it in the wild. However, once its flight feathers start coming in, thicken its formula or mash a little so the baby bird can get used to tasting and processing slightly more solid food. For instance, if you\u2019re making mash out of dog or cat food that\u2019s been soaked in water, you might add in 1-2 pieces of food that haven\u2019t been soaked quite as long, so they retain a little of their texture. You can also buy commercial weaning pellets from a pet supply store. These pellets are nutritionally designed for baby birds. This mimics how birds eat in the wild. As baby birds get older and start to eat more, the parents don\u2019t have time to digest the food as much before giving it to the baby bird. The baby then gradually transitions to eating solid food. Tip: If you\u2019re feeding with a syringe, you may need to switch to a spoon with the sides bent up."

Once you see the bird pecking at its feet and the bottom of its cage, offer it a little solid food, such as millet, suet cakes, rolled oats, or tiny pieces of insects, depending on what the species eats in the wild. If you use a lightweight dish, the bird might tip it over, creating a big mess. Try using a heavy plastic lid or a dish made specifically for feeding birds. If you\u2019re feeding the bird live mealworms, crush the insects\u2019 heads with tweezers before you place them in the dish."

If the bird doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do with the food in its dish, take a pair of tweezers and tap at the dish. You can also pick up a piece of food with the tweezers and offer it to the baby bird the way its mother might. To avoid startling the baby bird, only tap about once every second or so."

Baby birds can easily drown in a water dish, so it\u2019s best not to include one in the cage until it\u2019s older. If the water in your dish is deeper than about 1 in (2.5 cm), place smooth rocks in the dish as a perch."

The baby bird may refuse the formula altogether, it might only eat a little, or it might regurgitate the formula shortly after you feed it. As this starts to occur, eliminate the daytime feedings, only offering the bird formula at the end of the day. Stop hand-feeding the bird entirely when it no longer wants any formula. Continue monitoring the baby bird\u2019s weight. You may need to add back in an occasional supplemental formula as the bird\u2019s system adjusts to eating all supplemental food. Tip: If the baby bird changes to a new home within a few weeks of being weaned, it might benefit from being formula-fed for a few meals as it adjusts to its new location.

        "Alternate doing this for a few days\u2014skipping a feeding one day and giving it all of its formula feedings the next day.Tip: Make sure to always feed the bird formula for it\u2019s last meal of the day until it's completely weaned.",
        "This should typically be the last feeding that you eliminate.",
        "Baby birds don\u2019t eat overnight, so they need a good meal to hold them over while they\u2019re sleeping.",
        "Monitor the baby bird\u2019s poop for changes in the consistency.",
        "As you start introducing solid foods, keep an eye on the baby bird\u2019s poop.",
        "The exact appearance will depend on the species, but it should remain relatively unchanged as you start offering solid food.",
        "If you notice any major changes in texture or color, wait a few days before making any more changes to the bird\u2019s diet.",
        "If the poop appears thin or watery, the bird might be getting too much liquid in its diet.",
        "Try reducing the amount of water in its formula.",
        "Reduce the amount of formula you\u2019re giving in the early feedings.",
        "Once the bird starts getting used to the solid food, gradually reduce the amount of formula or mash you\u2019re giving it during its morning and mid-day feedings.",
        "However, don\u2019t eliminate them completely until you\u2019re sure the baby bird is getting all the food it needs from its adult diet.",
        "Try giving the baby bird about 3/4 as much formula as you normally would, for instance.",
        "After a few days, give it 3/4 of that amount, and so on.",
        "Add a water dish to the cage when you eliminate a formula feeding.",
        "While the bird is being formula fed, it doesn\u2019t need to have access to water, since it gets most of its water intake from its food.",
        "Once you\u2019re ready to start cutting out one of its formula feedings, though, the bird will need to have water available to make up the difference.",
        "Baby birds can easily drown in a water dish, so it\u2019s best not to include one in the cage until it\u2019s older.",
        "If the water in your dish is deeper than about 1 in (2.5 cm), place smooth rocks in the dish as a perch.",
        "Drop to 1 night-time feeding, then none, as the bird starts to reject the formula.",
        "Typically, birds will start to prefer solid food and will show less interest in formula.",
        "The baby bird may refuse the formula altogether, it might only eat a little, or it might regurgitate the formula shortly after you feed it.",
        "As this starts to occur, eliminate the daytime feedings, only offering the bird formula at the end of the day.",
        "Stop hand-feeding the bird entirely when it no longer wants any formula.",
        "Continue monitoring the baby bird\u2019s weight.",
        "You may need to add back in an occasional supplemental formula as the bird\u2019s system adjusts to eating all supplemental food.",
        "Tip: If the baby bird changes to a new home within a few weeks of being weaned, it might benefit from being formula-fed for a few meals as it adjusts to its new location.",
        "In addition, it\u2019s a good bonding experience for the bird and its new owner."
