        "Then, create a small hole in the car using a power drill equipped with a high-speed twist drill bit.",
        "Line up your hole so it is directly behind where your camera\u2019s power and video cable will go.",
        "To figure out where to make the hole, hold your camera up to the area you intend to mount it.",
        "Then, note the spot where its splitting cord sits.",
        "Create a hole that\u2019s large enough to fit your camera\u2019s power and video cable.",
        "If you come across any obstructions, try to remove them.",
        "If you can\u2019t, see if you can make a hole nearby.",
        "For most jobs, you\u2019ll need a drill bit that has a diameter between \u20448 and \u20444 in (0.32 and 0.64 cm).",
        "Place a rubber grommet around your camera cable.",
        "Before running your camera cable into the car, slip a rubber grommet onto it near the non-splitting end.",
        "These small rubber washers, available at most home improvement stores, will keep the wire in place and prevent leaks.",
        "Choose a grommet that\u2019s just large enough to fit inside the drilled hole.",
        "Run the camera cable into your trunk.",
        "Pull the splitting end of your camera\u2019s video and power cable through the drilled hole into the trunk of your car.",
        "Make sure you pull it tight so the rubber grommet lodges into the drilled hole.",
        "Your camera cable should run from the outside of the car to the inside of the car.",
        "Locate your car\u2019s 2 reverse light wires.",
        "Reverse light wires are the cords that connect your car\u2019s tail lights to the dashboard.",
        "They hook directly into your vehicle\u2019s tail lights and are normally located in the hatch or trunk of your car.",
        "These cords look different for every vehicle so, if you can\u2019t find them, consult your owner\u2019s manual for model specific information.",
        "Strip and separate your car\u2019s reverse light wires.",
        "Using a wire stripper or pliers, peel back the rubber covering the wires.",
        "Then, use a screwdriver or other thin tool to poke a hole through the middle of each exposed wire, separating the individual wire strands.",
        "For safety, make sure you do this while the car is turned off.",
        "Fuse your camera wires with the reverse light wires.",
        "Attach 1 of your bare wire cables to the camera cord\u2019s power connector.",
        "Then, poke your bare wires through the center of the exposed reverse light wires and twist them together.",
        "For safety, make sure you wrap the combined wires in electrical tape.",
        "Make sure you poke your positive (usually red) bare wire through the positive reverse light wire and the negative (usually black) bare wire through the negative reverse light wire.",
        "Putting in Your Monitor Route your camera\u2019s video cable to the front of the car.",
        "Connect your RCA cable to the camera cord\u2019s video connector if necessary.",
        "Then, run it through your vehicle to the area by the fuse box.",
        "Depending on your vehicle model, you\u2019ll usually be able to do this by peeling back the automobile\u2019s headliner or side panels and pulling your cable through the exposed chamber.",
        "For certain trucks, you may need to run the video cable through the vehicle\u2019s frame rail.",
        "In most cars, you\u2019ll find the fuse box underneath the steering wheel.",
        "Fix external monitors to the front windshield.",
        "If you\u2019re installing an external monitor, first attach your device\u2019s included mount to the windshield by following the manufacturer\u2019s included instructions.",
        "Then, hook your monitor onto the mount.",
        "Most external monitors use a suction mount, though others may come with a more complex mounting system.",
        "Attach internal monitors to the rear-view mirror or mirror mount.",
        "For certain internal monitors, you\u2019ll need to clip the new device onto your current rear-view mirror.",
        "For others, you\u2019ll need to take off the mirror and slide your monitor into the pre-existing mirror mount.",
        "Some internal monitors may come with their own mounting system that you\u2019ll have to attach to the car\u2019s front windshield.",
        "Run the monitor\u2019s splitter cable to the fuse box.",
        "If necessary, hook your monitor\u2019s power and video cable into the device.",
        "Then, route the cable from the monitor to the area next to the fuse box.",
        "If you\u2019d like, use a trim removal tool to pop out the headlining panel directly above your windshield.",
        "Then, run your cable through the exposed chamber.",
        "Connect your monitor\u2019s camera cable to the RCA cable.",
        "After routing your monitor\u2019s splitter cable, connect the video end of the cable to your camera\u2019s RCA cord.",
        "Then, wrap the connected cords with electrical tape to hold them together.",
        "If your RCA and video cables have the same ends, you may need to purchase an RCA male to female converter cord.",
        "You can find these at most electronic stores.",
        "Attach your monitor\u2019s power cable to a fuse tap.",
        "Connect your remaining bare wire cable to the backup monitor\u2019s power cord.",
        "Then, push the positive (usually red) end of the bare wire cable into the open end of a fuse tap.",
        "Finally, crimp the 2 cables together with a pair of pliers.",
        "A fuse tap is a small cable that converts a bare wire into a fuse signal.",
        "You can find them at most auto part stores.",
        "If you\u2019d prefer, you can leave the bare wire cable off and connect your camera\u2019s power cable to a cigarette lighter adaptor.",
        "Then, plug this adaptor into your car\u2019s cigarette lighter receptacle for power.",
        "Plug the fuse tap into the fuse box.",
        "Locate your fuse box and open it up.",
        "Then, plug your fuse tap into an open fuse cell.",
        "If necessary, check your fuse box\u2019s lid or your vehicle\u2019s instruction manual to see which slots are open.",
        "After attaching your fuse, consider taping all your wires together using electrical tape to get them out of the way.",
        "Mounting the Camera Connect your backup camera to its power and video cable.",
        "Return to the back of your car once you\u2019ve installed the rear-view monitor and all the necessary camera cords.",
        "Close the trunk if necessary, then connect the backup camera to its power and video cable.",
        "Your camera\u2019s power and video cable should be sticking out of the hole you drilled in the license plate mounting area.",
        "Mount the camera to your license plate.",
        "If the camera attaches to the front of your license plate, fix it to the plate by following the manufacturer\u2019s included instructions.",
        "If the camera attaches to the back of your license plate, line the device up with the plate\u2019s fastener holes and thread screws through them.",
        "In most cases, you can attach a rear-view camera to the back of your license plate using the screws you removed from the car earlier.",
        "Reattach your license plate and trim panels.",
        "Using a Phillips head screwdriver, put your rear license plate back on your vehicle.",
        "Once you\u2019ve reattached it, give the license plate and backup camera firm tugs to make sure they\u2019re secure.",
        "If you haven\u2019t already, reattach your car\u2019s interior trunk panel and other trim panels by pressing them back onto the vehicle.",
        "Test the camera to make sure everything works.",
        "Before using your new camera on public roads, test it in a safe area like your driveway.",
        "If it turns on, place a large, durable object like a trash can behind the camera to see how distorted the image is.",
        "If it does not turn on, read your installation manual for troubleshooting information.",
        "In many cases, rear-view camera malfunctions are caused by loose or improperly connected wires."
