                    "description": "Dead toenails are often created when blisters (often blood blisters) develop beneath the nail. The blister causes the skin underneath the nail to die, and once that skin dies, the nail separates and lifts away from the toe. If your toenail has died for another reason, including a fungal infection, there will likely be no blister to drain. Skip directly to the \"Removing the Toenail\" section of this article and follow the same removal and aftercare procedure. In the case of a fungal infection, visit your doctor, who can prescribe a suitable antifungal cream. Do not attempt to drain a blister underneath your nail if you suffer from diabetes, have peripheral arterial disease, or have any problems with your immune system. These scenarios can result in long term hard to treat infection and wounds not healing appropriately due to decreased immune system and lack of blood flow for healing. In this case, you must consult your physician."
