The above pad is 12' x 12'. Anything much larger and you will need 'deadmen' laid into the pad for lateral stability."

Drill a hole 1/16\" smaller than the diameter of your rod (1/2\" rod is ideal, but it's harder to cut with bolt cutters - 3/8\" rod will work also). This is so the rod will be snug in the timber. Cut your rod so that it will be driven at least 1' to 1 1/2' into the earth, plus the height of the timber (3\"). Pound the rod down and through your timber until the top of the rod is flush with the top of the timber. The rod has no head on it, so it won't hold the timber down - but it will hold it laterally and keep the timber from moving side to side. This will keep pressure from fill from pushing the wall out."

Depending on your grade, 8' might be too long - a 4' piece might work better.

When using landscape timbers as retaining walls, 6 timbers high is about all you can go without needing further lateral stability such as 'deadmen'. Remove the sod from the pad area, and begin filling with dirt. Remove sod with a spading fork. Rake out each wheelbarrow-load of dirt flat, and then tamp: Use the narrow edge of a board with a level on it to check your grade as you build up. It's easy to start mounding dirt in the middle - check for this as you go. Allow the new fill exposure to the weather for a while, if possible. Several heavy rains will cause the dirt to settle. However it will remain sticky when it's wet, because of the clay content. If you're not putting down gravel or pavers above, use a few bags of sand or lime to counteract this. Place your structure on the new grade. It can be anchored into the pad at the corners with rod. Drive the rod deep into the pad and attach this to the corners of your structure.
