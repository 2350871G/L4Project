Remember that trying to be right can make the relationship lose. Think like a team\u2014each player must contribute to the win. If one player loses, everyone loses. Compromise provides a chance for the relationship (i.e. both of you) to win rather than just one of you. If you keep this in mind during an argument, you are more likely to reach a solution that benefits the well-being of your relationship. The next time you and your partner are vying to be right, take a breather and consider what being right is doing for the relationship as a whole.
