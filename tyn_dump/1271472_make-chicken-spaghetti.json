Assembling and Baking Pre-heat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Adjust the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and allow it to pre-heat.

Keep in mind that you can begin pre-heating your oven while you are preparing the sauce so that it will reach the desired temperature by the time you finish assembling the ingredients.
