        "Turn it counterclockwise by hand to loosen the filter and let the water flow out into the bucket.",
        "Be careful to not put your feet or hands under the machine while it\u2019s raised up.",
        "You can use a brick or wood block to raise the machine up and set it on something stable.",
        "Lifting the machine can be pretty dangerous.",
        "If your machine is too heavy for you to raise on your own, you\u2019re better off simply dealing with problem while the water is still inside the drum.",
        "Opening a Manual Lock Turn the washing machine off and unplug it.",
        "If you\u2019re in the middle of a cycle, turn the dial or press the button to pause or end the cycle.",
        "Wait 5-6 seconds to see if the door unlocks.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t, turn the machine off by pressing the button or turning the dial all of the way to the off position.",
        "Unplug your machine.Tip: Consult your manual to see if your door locks manually or electronically.",
        "In general, the older your machine is, the more likely it is to have a manual lock.",
        "Wait 5 minutes and then try pulling on the handle.",
        "Some manual locks automatically undo the latch after the machine has been off for 5 minutes.",
        "After you\u2019ve pulled the plug, wait for a few minutes.",
        "Then, try to open the door by pulling on the handle.",
        "This is going to be the solution for most top-loading machines.",
        "The latches on top-loaders are typically heat-activated and only lock when the machine is running.",
        "This feature is designed to give you access to your wet clothes in the event of a power outage or electrical failure.",
        "If your washer is on the older side and doesn\u2019t have a digital screen, the lock is probably manual.",
        "If you\u2019ve ever noticed a hook or ridge on the piece that enters the lock, it\u2019s definitely a manual machine.",
        "Strike the handle gently with an open palm to loosen it.",
        "If your door still isn\u2019t unlocked, try loosening the lock with the power off.",
        "Use an open palm to gently strike the handle, right above the location of the lock.",
        "On some manual locks, this will be enough to shake it into the unlock position.",
        "You don\u2019t need to slap the machine so hard that you hurt yourself or damage the door.",
        "A little vibration and abrupt pressure should be plenty if your door can be unlocked this way.",
        "This is less likely to work on a top-loading machine since the lock hooks around a loop inside of the machine.",
        "Loop a fishing line around the seam of the door.",
        "Grab some nylon string or a reel of fishing line.",
        "Pull out a 10\u201320 in (25\u201351 cm) length and slide it into the seam where your door meets the frame of the machine at the lock.",
        "Extend the length of your string or fishing line as you work it all the way around the door.",
        "Tie the end of the string in a knot once it\u2019s completely wrapped around the door.",
        "If your handle seems loose, this is the best way to open the door.",
        "Sometimes a lose handle can\u2019t trigger the lock to open because it isn\u2019t connected to it.",
        "You need to tie the line on the side of the machine that is opposite to the lock.",
        "If you have a top-loading machine, pull it out from the wall.",
        "Go behind it and loop the fishing line around the seam where the lid closes.",
        "Tie it near the backside of the machine.",
        "Pull the fishing line away from the handle to unlock it.",
        "Grab the fishing line or nylon string by the knot.",
        "Pull it carefully away from the door at an angle parallel to the front of the machine.",
        "Continue to apply pressure until  you hear a clicking noise.",
        "When you do, hold the string in place with your nondominant hand and reach over to the handle.",
        "Pull it out to open the door.",
        "When you\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re physically pulling the lock out of the slot where it\u2019s locked in place.",
        "If this doesn\u2019t work, try using an old gift card or credit card to slide into the seam instead.",
        "Push the credit card into the lock to open it.",
        "On a top-loading machine, pull the string parallel to the lid, towards the backside of the machine.",
        "Unlocking an Electronic Lock Press \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstart\u201d to open an electrical lock.",
        "This may sound obvious, but you may not have pressed the pause button to stop the cycle.",
        "Try pressing \u201cpause\u201d and wait 1-2 minutes to see if the door unlocks.",
        "Electronic locks will not open when a cycle is actively running so try this first to see if the door opens after pausing the cycle.",
        "On some machines, the \u201cstart\u201d button functions as the pause button when the cycle is on.",
        "If your washer is newer and has a digital screen, the odds are really high that your lock is electronic.",
        "Turn the washing machine off and unplug it.",
        "If pausing the cycle doesn\u2019t unlock the door, turn the machine off.",
        "Then, unplug the machine and wait 5-10 minutes.",
        "Try pulling the handle again to see if the door opens.",
        "This is the most common solution for top loaders.",
        "Washing machines that are loaded from the top typically rely on a heat-activated sensor that locks the door when it\u2019s running a cycle.",
        "This is why it usually takes a few seconds for top-loading machines to unlock when you pause them.",
        "Like manual machines, some electronic locks automatically flip into the unlocked position after 5-10 minutes so that you can get your clothes during a power outage.",
        "Slide a flathead screwdriver in the seam of the bottom panel for a front loader.",
        "Inspect the bottom of your washing machine on the front.",
        "There is a 2\u20136 in (5.1\u201315.2 cm) panel that appears to be a part of the machine.",
        "On the right side of the machine, slide a flathead screwdriver in between the frame and this bottom panel.Tip: You can use a dull kitchen or butter knife instead of a flathead screwdriver.",
        "Keep in mind, you may end up bending it though.",
        "You can start on the left if you\u2019d like.",
        "It really doesn\u2019t matter so long as you don\u2019t start in the center.",
        "If you do that, you may crack the panel since the tension is strongest in the center.",
        "Pull the screwdriver handle up to pop the panel off of a front loader.",
        "With the head of the screwdriver wedged in between the 2 panels, slide the handle up with moderate pressure to pop the panel off.",
        "Do this slowly to ensure that you don\u2019t bend or break the panel.",
        "Once the right side is off, repeat the process on the left side.",
        "If this isn\u2019t working, consult the washing machine\u2019s instruction manual.",
        "There may be a switch or a latch under your machine that you need to use to get this panel off.",
        "Find the plastic tab sticking out under the handle of a front-loading door.",
        "With the bottom panel set aside, look at the top of the section that you removed for a small plastic tab that is sticking out of the machine.",
        "This tab is usually directly under the lock on the handle, and it\u2019s often color-coded to make it easy to find.",
        "This tab is connected to the lock directly.",
        "It\u2019s a safety measure designed to manually unlock the electronic lock on the machine in the event that the computer in the washer fails.",
        "Pull the tab down 1\u20133 in (2.5\u20137.6 cm) while opening the front door.",
        "Once you\u2019ve found the tab, grip it between your thumb and index finger.",
        "Pull slightly on the tab to bring it down 1\u20133 in (2.5\u20137.6 cm).",
        "With the tab pulled down, pull on your door handle to open it.",
        "If your door still won\u2019t open, contact a washing machine repair company.",
        "There may be a physical defect in the lock holding it shut.",
        "Unscrew the bolts in the back of a top-loading machine to lift it up.",
        "Turn your top-loading machine around so that you can access the back.",
        "Look for 3-4 screws or bolts that are at the same height as your door.",
        "Unscrew them with a wrench, screwdriver, or channel locks and remove them.",
        "Then, lift the entire top of the machine up by raising it from the top panel.",
        "If unplugging the machine didn\u2019t resolve the problem for your top loader, the lock may be magnetic.",
        "This is common on digital machines.",
        "If you have a magnetic lock, you can\u2019t pry it open or trick it into unlocking.",
        "You\u2019ll need to lift the entire panel up."
