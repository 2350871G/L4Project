These shades are opposite blue on the color wheel, so they create a bold contrast with blue eyes that really make them pop. Some shades to consider include copper, amber, and brown.

That\u2019s because orange is opposite blue and red is opposite green on the color wheel. Some blue tones to consider include cobalt, navy, teal, violet, and midnight blue.

Black liner is traditionally used for a smoky eye, but you can also use a dark liner that coordinates with your shadows. If you\u2019re doing a blue smoky eye, you can substitute a navy eyeliner.

The crease of your eye is the area above the lid where your eye naturally folds. A brown or tan shade is usually the best option for a transition shade. If you\u2019re worried about your smoky eye looking too stark, you may want to use a transition shade with some warmth. Your bronzer can do double-duty as your transition shade as long as it\u2019s in the same color palette as the other colors.

When it comes to choosing colored shadows for a smoky look on blue eyes, warm metallic and brown shades are usually the most flattering option. These shades are opposite blue on the color wheel, so they create a bold contrast with blue eyes that really make them pop. Some shades to consider include copper, amber, and brown. Warm green tones also work well for blue eyes. Select dark purple shades for green and hazel eyes. For green and hazel eyes, you\u2019ll get the most flattering colorful smoky eye if you use a dark purple shadow, such as plum. This will create a striking contrast for eyes that are green or have green flecks. Grab blue or green shades for brown eyes. Brown eyes typically feature orange and red undertones, so blue and green shades typically offer the best smoky eye look. That\u2019s because orange is opposite blue and red is opposite green on the color wheel. Some blue tones to consider include cobalt, navy, teal, violet, and midnight blue. Some green tones to consider include olive, forest green, emerald, and moss. Opt for purple shades no matter what your eye color. Purple is the most universally flattering shade of eyeshadow, so it typically works well for everyone. It is especially beautiful with brown and green eyes, but blue-eyed people can wear it too. Some purple tones to consider include eggplant, plum, and royal purple. Get 3 to 4 shades in whatever color you choose.

        "Grab blue or green shades for brown eyes.",

        "Applying a Traditional Colorful Smoky Eye Apply an eyeshadow primer or base.",

        "If you\u2019re doing a red or pink smoky eye, you can substitute a reddish brown eyeliner.",
        "Like black, a charcoal gray eyeliner can also work with any colorful smoky eye.",
        "Sweep a neutral shadow through the crease.",
        "To help the colorful shadows you use in your smoky blend more easily, you want to use a subtle transition color in the crease.",
