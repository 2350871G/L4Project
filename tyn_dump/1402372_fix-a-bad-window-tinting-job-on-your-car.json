            "description": "Cut heavy black garbage bag to the size of your window. If 1 bag is not large enough to cover your window, you may use more than 1 bag. Wet the outside of the window you are fixing and place the black bag against the window. The bag should cover the entire window and the water should keep it in place. Cover the entire back seat and the inside, under-window deck with a tarp. Spray the entirety of the inside window surface (the tinted side) liberally with ammonia. Park the car in the sun, allowing for the window to heat up under the black garbage back, and leave it sitting for about an hour. Starting in a corner without a defroster line, use a razor blade to peel back the film. Spray ammonia to the film as needed to keep it damp and to keep the film's adhesive from drying again. The entire film should come off in 1 piece. If you have a steamer, you may skip the ammonia-soaking process and use the steamer to heat the tinted window and remove the film in the same way.
