Before using the bladders, inspect them to make sure they're free of blood clots and other large blemishes. Hake, cod, or other fish with swim bladders can work as an alternative.

Continue stirring until the paste completely dissolves and turns the water a milky white color. You should stir the swim bladder paste consistently for the entire 45 minutes. Filtering and Drying Isinglass Filter the isinglass glue through a nylon stocking. Place a nylon stocking over the top of a glass container and pour the isinglass glue into it. The stocking should catch any residual inconsistencies and help make the glue smooth. If you do not have a nylon stocking, you can use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter as an alternative. Pour the glue onto a non-stick mylar sheet. Place the mylar sheet on a flat surface where it can stay for 1-2 days undisturbed.
