For example, you can use a white tablecloth with white tulle, or you can pair a white tablecloth with pink tulle. Match the tablecloth shape to the table. Use a round tablecloth for a round table, and a rectangular tablecloth for a rectangular table. Make sure that the tablecloth is big enough to reach the floor.

        "For example, you can use light pink and dark pink instead of just light pink.",
        "Try a rainbow of colors: pink, orange, pastel yellow, mint green, pale blue, and light purple.",
        "For a more magical display, consider using sparkly or glittery tulle.",
        "Cut your tulle into strips that are twice the height of your table.",
        "Measure the height of your table first, from the floor all the way to the table top.",
        "Double your measurement, then cut your tulle into strips that match that length.",
        "How many strips you cut depends on how much coverage you want on your table.",
        "Cut just a few for right now.",
        "Cut a piece of cardboard to the height of your table.",
        "Wrap the tulle around it, then cut the bottom edge to separate the strands.",

        "Take 1 strip and fold it in half so that the narrow ends match up.",
        "Slide the folded end behind the elastic to make a loop, then pull the 2 tulle tails through the loop to tighten the knot.",
        "Make sure that the folded end is pointing down when you slide it behind the elastic, not up.",
        "The tighter you make the knot, the fuller your tutu will be.",
        "Continue to tie the tulle strips around the table until the elastic is full.",
        "Make sure that the knots are touching each other.",
        "If you leave too much space between the knots, your table tutu won't be very full.",
        "If you run out of strips, cut some more.",
        "If the table will be against a wall, you only need to cover the sides that will be visible.",
        "If a pin gets in the way, you may need to move it.",

        "Measure the circumference of your table, then cut the ribbon accordingly.",
        "Wrap the ribbon around the tabletop so that it covers the knots.",
        "Use a drop of hot glue or fabric glue every 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) to secure the ribbon to the tutu.",
        "Make sure that the ends of the ribbon are in the back of the table.",
        "Match the color to the tutu or the tablecloth.",
        "You can also use a darker shade than the tutu (i.e.",
        ": dark pink ribbon for a light pink tutu).",
        "Choose a ribbon that is wide enough to cover the knots.",
        "Something that is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) will work fine, but you can go wider.",
        "Use a chiffon flower trim instead if you want a girly look.",
        "Measure the circumference of your table, then cut some chiffon flower trim to that length.",
        "Glue the trim around the edge of the table to hide the knots from the tulle.",
        "You can use fabric glue or hot glue for this.",
        "For a non-permanent option, use pins instead.",
        "The bulk of the flowers should help hide the pins.",
        "Choose a trim that is wide enough to cover the knots.",
        "It can be the same color as the tulle and/or tablecloth, or a coordinating color.",
        "You can find this trim at a fabric store's trim and ribbon section.",

        "Upgrade a ribbon or flower trim with glittery silhouettes, if desired.",
        "Wrap your ribbon or chiffon flower trim around the table first.",
        "Next, use a stencil to trace shapes onto the back of glittery scrapbooking paper.",
        "Cut the shapes out, then secure them to the trim with hot glue or fabric glue.",
        "Use shapes and colors that match your theme.",
        "For example, use princess crowns for a princess party, or hearts for a wedding.",
        "The shapes should be around 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) tall.",
        "Don't get carried away.",
        "You only need 1 shape at each corner, and 1 shape in the middle.",
        "Wrap a floral garland around the tabletop if you want a forest look.",
        "Measure the circumference of your table, then buy a floral garland that\u2019s close to that length.",
        "Cut the garland shorter, if needed, then wrap it around the tabletop.",
        "Use T-shaped floral pins to secure it to the tutu, making sure that you go through the tulle, elastic, and tablecloth.",
        "Again, if the table is against a wall, you only need to cover 3 sides.",
        "For a fairy look, use a garland with flowers; they can have some green leaves too.",
        "Make sure that the colors go well with your tutu.",
        "For a fall look, use a garland made from maple leaves in reds, oranges, and yellows.",

        "Create a fancier look with a scalloped fabric tablecloth.",
        "Finish your tutu first, then drape a second, solid-colored tablecloth over your table.",
        "Starting at a corner, gather the bottom edge of the tablecloth, and secure it to the top edge of the tutu with a safety pin.",
        "Do this a few more times along the edges of your table until you get the look you want.",
        "A plain fabric tablecloth would work fine, but a nicer fabric, such as velvet, would work better.",
        "Don\u2019t use plastic.",
        "Cover the safety pins with large, silk flowers or satin ribbon bows.",
        "Alternatively, wrap the fabric around the edges of the table instead.",
        "This way, the top of the table will be exposed.",
        "Use a different color or shade from the tutu.",
        "For example, you can use dark blue for a light blue tutu, or purple for a pink tutu.",
        "Use beaded garlands instead of fabric as an alternative.",
        "Wrap a beaded pearl garland around the top edge of your table.",
        "Safety pin it at each corner and every 12 to 24 inches (30 to 61 cm).",
        "Let the garland droop a little between each pin to create a scalloped look.",
        "You can do this in addition to fabric scallops for an even fancier look.",
        "Make the beaded scallops droop lower than the fabric ones."
