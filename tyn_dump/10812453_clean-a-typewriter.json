Work your way around the machine with the paintbrush and vacuum cleaner to free up and remove the dust from all of the surfaces, key faces, and crevices. You can find a variety of small paintbrushes at craft stores. Pick one with very soft bristles. Alternatively, you can use a toothbrush instead of a paintbrush. However, only use a toothbrush on modern typewriters and not antiques. This is because the bristles may be too rough, which can cause paint to flake off older machines. Try to use a toothbrush labeled \"very soft\" if possible."
