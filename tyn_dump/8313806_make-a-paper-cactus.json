Be sure to cut through all sheets of paper at the same time; you want the shapes to be identical. Keep the shape simple. You will add details, such as leaves and spikes, separately. If the paper is too thick to cut all at once, draw a template first, trace it onto the paper, then cut the shapes out individually. If you don't know how to draw a cactus, you can use a stencil or find a template online. You can use any type of paper you want, such as cardstock or construction.
