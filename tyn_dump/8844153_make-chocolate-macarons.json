    "text": " Making the Macaron Shells Sift the dry ingredients together. In a medium-sized bowl, sift the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and almond flour two times only. Set aside for later use. Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat the whites on medium speed until they're foamy. Fold in the cream of tartar and keep blending.  Pour in the sugar, adding a tablespoon at a time. Pick up the speed to medium-high and keep beating the whites. Peaks should begin to form. Sift in the almond flour mixture into the egg whites. Combine the ingredients together using a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix. Mix the batter together clockwise from the bottom, going up around the sides, and then cutting the batter in half.

If it doesn't dissolve, keep continuing to fold the batter together, but if it does dissolve then stop mixing at once. Scoop the macaron batter in a pastry bag with a tip.  Pipe the batter on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. Pipe small amounts of batter, about 1.5-inch rounds. Keep each amount one inch away from one another. There will be approximately 42 shells. If air bubbles appear, firmly tap the baking tray down to pop them. Air bubbles can crack macaron shells when they bake. Baking and Making the Ganache Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0 Fahrenheit (150\u00b0 Celsius).  Allow the macarons to sit for about 15-30 minutes. Before getting baked, let the shells dry.
