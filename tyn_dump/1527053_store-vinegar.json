As such, it should not be stored in containers made from brass, copper, iron or tin or corrosion and leaching will set in, creating reactions between the metals and the vinegar and therefore damaging the food.

Although vinegar is the product of wine having gone bad, vinegar can also go bad after a while and it tends to lose flavor after it is opened. Store for around 6 months; after a year you will probably find that the vinegar doesn't taste as good as it did when first purchased. Fruit and herb vinegars are best kept in the refrigerator as this keeps their flavor at its best."
