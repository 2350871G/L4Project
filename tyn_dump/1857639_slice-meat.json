    "text": " Cutting Large Slices of Raw Meat Place a large cut of meat, like a tenderloin or a roast, on your cutting board.  Locate the grain of your meat. The grain is the set of lines created by layers of muscle fiber. Position the meat so that the grain is parallel to your cutting board.  Place the blade of your knife at a 45-degree angle against the side of the meat furthest from you. You will be slicing at an angle downward, down through the grain. Make sure you have a clean sharp knife. Blunt knife makes the cutting worse. Pull your knife across the meat. Apply downward pressure as you pull the knife across to start carving your slice from the rest of the meat cut. Push your knife back across the meat while applying downward pressure.  Continue pulling and pushing your knife down through the grain of the meat until you\u2019ve cut off the desired slice.  Store the meat or utilize it according to recipe instructions.  Cutting Small Slices of Raw Meat for Stir Fry Place a thinner cut of meat, such as a steak, chicken breast or slice of pork loin on your cutting board.  Locate the grain of the meat.  Position your knife so that it is perpendicular to the direction of the fiber.  Pull your knife across the meat and apply downward pressure to cut. Make sure that your slices are no more than 1/4\u201d (6 millimeters) thick. Push the knife back across the meat as you apply downward pressure. You will create short strips of flesh, which will both shorten your cooking time and produce more tender pieces of cooked meat. Continue pulling and pushing your knife against the grain until you have removed a long, narrow strip of meat from the rest of the cut.  Place your knife parallel to the grain and cut the long strip into 1\u201d (2.5 centimeter) pieces.  Store the meat or utilize it according to recipe instructions.  Cutting Slices of Roasted Meat Remove your roasted meat from the oven. Place the pan on your range top or on a counter that has been protected with hot pads. Pull a slice of aluminum foil off of the roll. Place the foil loosely over your meat, creating a \u201ctent\u201d over your meat. Allow your roast to rest for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil tent. If you want to, then move your meat to a serving platter. If your dinner is more informal, then you can slice it right in the roasting pan. Spear the meat with a fork about 1/2\u201d (12 millimeters) from the tip. This will stabilize your meat without requiring you to touch it with your hands. Use your non-dominant hand to hold the fork while you slice. Place your knife against the side of the meat at a 45-degree angle using your dominant hand.  Pull the knife toward you while applying downward pressure.  Push the knife away from you, applying downward pressure so that you slice down through the grain.  Continue pushing and pulling your knife until you separate the meat slice from the rest of the cut.  Lay the meat flat with its edge against the edge of your platter.  Continue slicing until your meat is fully carved. Lay each slice on top of the previous slice so that 1\u201d (2.5 centimeters) of the top of the previous slice is exposed. This will create an attractive layered presentation. Store or serve the meat slices. ",
