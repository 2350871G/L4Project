If you would like to create a more playful version of the top hat, you can also cut out separate bands in alternating colors to form the flue. Stitch the bands together lengthwise so that they form a single flue piece with a height of 6 1/2 inches (16.5 cm)."

        "Ultimately, you will want this part of the hat to have a rounded shape, not a flat shape.",
        "The seam allowance will vary depending on how large your head is.",
        "The portion of the fabric leading up to the seam should be about half of the diameter of your brim opening, and when unfolded, this portion of the flue should be about the same size as that brim opening.",
        "Unfold.",
        "Release the fold of the flue and try to shape it with your fingers so that the flue shape, as a whole, forms a rounded shape.",
        "If there is a crease along the side you folded previously and you cannot get it out simply with your fingers, you could try placing the flue over a round vase, lamp, or similar object to stretch it in that circular shape.",
        "Remove the crease by applying steam with your iron.",
        "Putting the Hat Together Place the flue on the top or \"lid\" piece.",
        "Place the lid piece wrong-side up on your working surface and set the flue wrong-side out on top.",
        "Pin in place.",
        "Pin the pieces together as close to the edge as possible to prevent them from wiggling apart.",
        "Sew together.",
        "Sew the flue to the lid using a sewing machine or needle.",
        "Leave a seam allowance of 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).",
        "Turn the flue and top right-side out once the two pieces have been attached.",
        "Line the flue up with the brim.",
        "Pull the bottom edge of the flue slightly through the hole you cut in the brim, leaving 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3.175 to 6.35 mm) of fabric beneath the brim.",
        "Pin in place.",
        "Pin the overhanging portion of the flue fabric to the underside of the brim, placing the pins as close to the edge as possible.",
        "Sew together.",
        "Sew the overhanging portion of flue fabric to the underside of the brim using a sewing machine or needle.",
        "The seam allowance should only be about 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).",
        "Finishing Touches Trim away any excess material.",
        "Any excess fabric on the inside of the brim or flue should be trimmed away with sewing scissors or shears.",
        "While this is not strictly essential since the excess fabric should be hidden, it might make the hat more comfortable to wear.",
        "Decorate your top hat as desired.",
        "You can leave the top hat plain and wear it as is, or you can add decorative elements to it to personalize it or make it usable for a costume.",
        "If you are using the hat for cosplay or costume purposes, study pictures of the character you are trying to dress as and decorate the hat accordingly.",
        "If you want the top hat to look more \u201cclassic,\u201d you could try embellishing it by attaching a black satin ribbon around the base of the flue.",
        "To make the top hat more versatile, add embellishments that are removable.",
        "Wear your new top hat proudly.",
        "Your top hat should now be complete and ready to wear."
