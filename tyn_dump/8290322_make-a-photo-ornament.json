        "Stick the looped end to the tape on the back of the photo with the entire length lying flat.",
        "Then, take the circular piece of cardstock you cut and sandwich the fishing line between the cardstock and photo.",
        "You\u2019ll now have a photo of the right size complete with backing and a way to lower the photo into the glass bulb.",
        "Line up the edges of the photo and cardstock before pressing them together.",
        "Don\u2019t use glue to attach the photo to the cardstock.",
        "It could wrinkle or bleed through the photo.",
        "Roll and lower the photo into the bulb.",
        "Remove the small metal cap from the ornament bulb.",
        "Gently roll the photo and cardstock into a loose tube, picture side out.",
        "Be careful not to use too much pressure, or the photo could crease.",
        "Slide the rolled photo into the bulb with the fishing line coming out of the top.",
        "This will give you a way to pull the photo out if you make a mistake, and it will also act to fix the photo in place inside the ornament.",
        "Hold on tight to the fishing line as you drop the photo in.",
        "If you lose it, it could be a pain to get out.",
        "Smooth out the photo.",
        "Find a slender, blunted tool that will fit inside the opening of the bulb.",
        "Reach one end in side and use it to smooth out the edges of the rolled picture.",
        "Rather than being perfectly flat, the photo will now have a slight curve to it, matching the rounded contours of the ornament.",
        "The shaft of a pencil, ink pen or paint brush will work well for this purpose.",
        "Make sure whatever implement you use doesn\u2019t scratch or damage the photo.",
        "Replace the cap and hang the ornament.",
        "Guide either end of the fishing line through the holes in the top of the cap.",
        "Slide the cap down the fishing line and press it firmly into place.",
        "Tie off the fishing line and use it to hang the ornament, or attach a separate piece of ribbon or twine to make it more visually interesting.",
        "It\u2019s that easy!",
        "Adjust the length of the fishing line inside the ornament so that the photo is suspended in just the right place.",
        "If you decide to use ribbon to hang the ornament, secure it by laying it across the top of the ornament before you tie down the ends of the fishing line.",
        "Crafting a Wooden Block Ornament Select multiple photos.",
        "For a wooden block ornament, you have the freedom to use up to 6 different pictures.",
        "Sort through your photos and set aside your favorites.",
        "Trim each photo so that it will fit squarely on the face of the block with a small portion of the block visible around the edges.",
        "These can all be recent images, or you could select one photo from throughout the years for each side of the block to show how the subject has grown and matured.",
        "Making a wooden block ornament is like a unique form of scrapbooking that you can show off during the holidays.",
        "Decorate the wooden block.",
        "Paint the faces of the block with an array of colors and patterns, or glue a square of patterned paper onto each side for a stylish collage effect.",
        "Or, if you prefer, you can leave the wooden surface plain or finished with a thin coat of stain to preserve the more rustic, down-home look.",
        "The block base is a blank canvas for this project, which means you\u2019re free to be as imaginative as you want.",
        "Shop around for dazzling glitter and metallic paints, instead of ordinary solid colors.",
        "These will stand out more beneath the photos.",
        "Get creative decorating the block.",
        "Use found materials like newspaper or eye-catching bits of fabric in place of ordinary paint, or to create stylish borders for each photo.",
        "Glue the photos to each side of the block.",
        "Apply a thin layer of craft glue (a glue stick could also work well for this purpose) to the back of each photo and line them up with the faces of the block.",
        "Press down firmly on the picture to stick it in place.",
        "Run the pad of your finger over the surface of the photo to make sure it holds.",
        "Work with a craft glue that isn\u2019t too thick or runny and only use a small amount to keep from ruining the photo.",
        "Finish the block with a coat of acrylic.",
        "Dab a little acrylic sealant onto each face of the block and use a thin paintbrush or sponge to spread a thin coat over the photo and wooden edges.",
        "Not only will this guarantee that the photo will stay right where you want it, it will also provide a permanent glossy finish.",
        "Let the acrylic sealant dry completely before hanging or handling the ornament.",
        "Applying a sealant will preserve and protect the ornament, ensuring that you get years and years of use out of it.",
        "Brush the acrylic sealant thinly and evenly on each side.",
        "Screw in the hook and hang.",
        "Finally, take the screw-in hook and drill it by hand into the flat part of one corner of the block.",
        "Test the hook to see if it\u2019s firm and secure.",
        "You can now tie on a length of ribbon or fishing line and use it to hang the ornament, or simply slide the hook directly over a thin tree branch or nail.",
        "You\u2019re finished!",
        "Find a place to screw in the hook where it won\u2019t damage one of the photos.",
        "If you\u2019re feeling particularly crafty, add other embellishments like lace, beads or tassels to the ornament."
