To prevent dirtiness from building up on your boots and causing longer cleaning times, do this after each time you use your boots. To increase the dirt fighting potential of your damp cloth, mix 1 tsp (5 ml) of dish soap with a \u00bc gallon (1 L) of water. Douse your rag in this, and wipe down the boots. Wipe your boots from the top to the bottom. This way, you\u2019re less likely to cause dirt and grime to drip onto already cleaned parts of the boots."

After most of the dirtiness has been removed, wipe away any that remains with a damp cloth. If you do not have a suitable place in your yard to do this, or if you do not have a yard, wash your boots in your bathtub or shower instead. For mud that just doesn\u2019t want to come off, combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of baking soda with \u00bd cup (237 ml) of warm water. Rub this onto the stubborn mud, wait 15 to 30 minutes, then rinse the solution and the mud free."
