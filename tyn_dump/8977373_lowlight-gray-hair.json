Tuck it against your scalp. The hair should only be covering half of the foil; move it off to the side, if needed. Brush the hair dye onto the hair covering the aluminum foil. Remove the rat-tail comb, allowing the hair to fall against the foil. Use a hair dye brush to apply your chosen dye to the hair. Cover the dyed hair with the rest of the foil piece. Fold the bottom part of the foil over the dyed hair first. Next, fold the side edge of the foil over the hair as well, covering it the rest of the way. Continue to dye your hair in a similar manner.
