Buy a piece that\u2019s 2 ft by 4 ft by \u00bd in (.61 m by 1.2 m by 1.27 cm) or cut it to the correct measurements using a table saw. Exercise caution when cutting to ensure no one gets hurt. Try to pick a natural, non-treated wood. Avoid wood treated with chemicals, as these may be harmful to cats. Cut the base carpet to size. Your carpet should be at least 3 ft (.92 m) by 5 ft (1.5 m) to ensure you have enough to wrap around the base and staple it tightly. Use an X-acto knife and a ruler to ensure you have a neat, straight line. Choose a stiff carpet, such as Berber, for a longer lasting post. Cut notches for the corners.

Purchase a 4 in by 4 in (10 cm by 10 cm) piece of wood from the hardware store.

If you\u2019re not sure how long to make it, measure your cat from nose to end of tail, then add a few in/cm. Cover the top of the post. Get a 4 in by 4 in (10 cm by 10 cm)  beveled wood square from the hardware store for a neat post topper. Use wood glue to attach the topper to the post. Alternatively, you can cover the top in carpet and staple it down. Put two staples on each side of the post, rather than on the top. Cut the post carpet to size. It needs to be at least 20 in (51 cm) wide in order to wrap around the post, and the exact height of the post. Use an X-acto knife and a ruler to ensure you have a neat, straight line. Wrap carpet around the post. Start at a corner and staple the carpet in place every 1 in (2.5 cm) vertically.
