        "Glue a straw to each wrist piece to make a nozzle for the webbing.",
        "Take your scissors and snip two 1 in (2.5 cm) pieces from the end of a plastic drinking straw.",

        "Then, cut it into individual segments using a hacksaw or similar tool.",
        "Work slowly and carefully to avoid accidents.",
        "For this style of web shooter, you can either make the pipe segments completely encircle your arm or concentrate them in the area on the inside of your wrist.",

        "Allow the painted PVC to dry for 30-60 minutes.",
        "The pipe segments need to be dry to the touch before you continue working with them.",
        "Otherwise, the paint may smudge or rub off on your hands, clothing, or other objects.",

        "When you\u2019re done, cut 2 small squares from a second roll of rough, adhesive Velcro, peel off their backs, and stick them onto the inside of one end of each wrist strap.",

        "If you have 6 segments, for example, you\u2019ll need a total of 12 squares of Velcro.",
        "Make sure you have enough Velcro to cut all of the squares you need, along with the wrist straps themselves.",
        "It may be a good idea to pick up a little extra just in case.",
        "Attach the PVC pieces to the Velcro all around the wrist straps.",
        "All you have to do now is press the pipe segments into place around the Velcro straps.",
        "As mentioned, you can position them all the way around your wrist or group 3-4 together on the inside of your arm just over your palm.",
