Convert your megapixel count to a total pixel count by multiplying it by 1 million, if necessary.  Get a horizontal-to-vertical and vertical-to-horizontal ratio. You get the horizontal-to-vertical ratio by dividing the first part of your aspect ratio by the second; you get the vertical-to-horizontal ratio by dividing the second part of your aspect ratio by the third.
