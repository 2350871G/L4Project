        "When the meat turns opaque and takes on a plump, juicy appearance, they\u2019re ready to come out.",
        "Avoid stirring the fillets as they\u2019re poaching.",
        "Handling them too much could cause them to fall apart.",
        "Poaching is one of the fastest ways to prepare lighter types of fish like hake.",
        "Drain and serve the hake.",
        "Remove the fillets from the saucepan using a slotted spoon to strain the excess liquid.",
        "Place the fillets on a layer of folded paper towels to soak up any remaining moisture, then transfer them to individual plates for serving.",
        "Poached hake goes particularly well with bright, mild vegetables like tomatoes, mushrooms, and zucchini.",
        "Some buttery dinner rolls or a loaf of crusty, fresh-baked bread can help balance out the moistness of the fish nicely.",
        "Poach fish is best enjoyed fresh.",
        "However, any uneaten portions should keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator when stored along with the remaining poaching liquid.",
        "Pan-Frying Hake Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oil in a large skillet.",
        "Place the skillet on the cooktop over medium heat and drizzle in just enough oil to cover the bottom.",
        "You\u2019ll know it\u2019s reached the right temperature when it begins to shimmer and smoke faintly.",
        "Oils with high smoke points, such as olive, canola, or vegetable oil, tend to be best for pan frying.",
        "Place the hake fillets in the skillet with the skin side down.",
        "The fish will begin sizzling as soon as it comes into contact with the hot oil, so be sure to release it as close to the pan as possible to safeguard yourself from pops and splatters.",
        "Situate the fillets roughly half an inch (2.7 cm) apart to prevent crowding or sticking.",
        "You may only be able to fit 1-2 fillets in the skillet at a time, depending on the size of the fish and your cookware.",
        "A pair of tongs can come in handy if you\u2019re worried about being burned.",
        "Fry the skin side of the fillets for 3-4 minutes.",
        "This should be just enough time to get the exterior nice and crispy.",
        "Allow the fish to cook until the meat just above the skin begins to turn white.",
        "Hake is typically eaten with the skin on, similar to heartier fish like salmon or bass.",
        "Turn the hake fillets over.",
        "Slide your spatula under the fillets and give them a flip.",
        "Press the spatula firmly against the top of each fillet for a moment until you feel it relax.",
        "This will help the underside sear evenly and loosen up the meat for a more tender bite.",
        "Make sure you separate the skin from the pan prior to turning.",
        "Otherwise, it can easily stick and lead to breaking and tearing.",
        "Always use a spatula to flip fish rather than tongs.",
        "Not only is it easier, it also makes you less likely to mangle your main course in the process, improving its presentation.",
        "Continue frying for 1-2 minutes, or until done.",
        "The hake should only require another minute or so to finish cooking after being turned.",
        "Use the edge of your spatula to cut partway into a piece to see how it\u2019s coming along.",
        "The interior should be white and flaky, with a light browning on both sides.",
        "The fillets will be very hot when they first come out of the pan.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to give them a minute or two to cool down before you begin eating.",
        "Serve pan-fried hake with other delectable dishes.",
        "Whip up some crowd-pleasers like garlic mashed potatoes or saut\u00e9ed spinach to round out the meal.",
        "For a lighter touch, slice a couple tomatoes or a put together a root vegetable medley instead.",
        "Pull up a chair and help yourself while it\u2019s hot!",
        "Rich cream sauces can make an excellent compliment to the crisp, golden-brown fillets.",
        "Stash your leftovers in the refrigerator and try to consume them within 3-4 days.",
        "Reheat the fried fish under the broiler in your oven or in a pan with fresh oil to preserve its tender texture and prevent it from becoming soggy."
