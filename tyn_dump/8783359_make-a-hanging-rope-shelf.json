Multiply that number by two, so you can double each piece of rope. Add eighteen inches (45 cm) to that number for the knots you\u2019ll make in the rope. For example, if your ceiling is eight feet (2.4 m) tall and you want your shelf to sit five feet (1.5 m) from the floor, you\u2019re designating three feet (91 cm) of space between the ceiling and where the shelf ends. Double three feet (91 cm) and you get six feet (1.8 m); add eighteen inches (45 cm) to that number. Thus, you\u2019ll want two pieces of rope that are 7\u00bd feet (2.3 m) each."

For example, if your ceiling is eight feet (2.4 m) high and you want the shelves to end four feet (1.2 m) from the ground, the shelves will hang in a four-foot (1.2 m) area.
