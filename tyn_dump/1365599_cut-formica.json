The smallest sheet available is generally a 3x8 feet (.9x2.44 m); however, some home improvement stores offer scrap bins if your project is small. Measure the area you wish to laminate with a tape measure.  Mark the cutting line on the Formica with a pen or pencil.  Place masking tape on the cutting line. Use extra layers of tape at the edge of the Formica where the saw will first start the cut. If the line is not visible through the tape, remeasure and remark on top of the masking tape. Lay the Formica on a flat, rigid surface. You can use a scrap piece of plywood or OSB as a table to cut Formica. The surface you use will probably be scored by the saws, so be sure that what you are using is safe to cut on and can get damaged. Cement would not be a good surface to cut on. Use a circular saw or laminate shears to cut the Formica into large pieces. Do not try to cut a curve with a circular saw. Cut out the shape's form, and leave the trimming for a finer saw and corners for a saw with a some flexibility. Install the Formica onto the countertop or other location.  Use a jigsaw with a fine blade to trim the Formica and make any rounded cuts.  Use a belt sander with a grit of 100 to smooth the edges. Belt sanders can be heavy to operate, and you may choose to sand the edges by hand or with a small metal file. Using a Router to Cut Formica Cut the Formica to 1/8 inch (.32 cm) larger than the size needed.  Remove any masking tape used for the larger cuts with the circular saw.  Install the Formica onto the location.  Trim the Formica to the exact size needed. Use a trim router that features a laminate cutting bit.
