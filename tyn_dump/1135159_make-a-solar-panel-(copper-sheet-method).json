As long as the layer is thick enough, this will result in the black cuprous oxide flaking off and exposing the red cupric oxide layer. Note that cupric oxide (Copper (II) oxide) is the fully oxidized form, and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is still in an active state. You can rinse the sheet under water to remove the remaining black deposits. Cupric oxide is a semiconductor and must be exposed in order to make the solar cell function."
