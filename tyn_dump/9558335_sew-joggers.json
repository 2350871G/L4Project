The waistband should be elastic or drawstring. Make sure that the pants fit you well. Keep in mind that the pants will end up a little shorter than they are now. Cut the hem and 6 inches (15 cm) off of each leg. Spread the pants out on a flat surface and cut the hem off of each leg, just above the stitching. Discard the hem, then cut 6 inches (15 cm) off of each pant leg, starting from the raw, cut edge. Save these 6 in (15 cm) pieces; they will become cuffs for your joggers. Use a straight edge to make sure that the lines you are cutting are nice and straight. Make your 6 in (15 cm) cuffs narrower by 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Turn the cuffs inside out first. Choose a side seam to cut, then cut 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) off to make the cuffs narrower. You only need to cut 1 side seam on each cuff.

Wash, dry, and iron the fabric according to the instructions on the bolt. If you forgot to take down the washing instructions, wash the fabric using cold water on a gentle cycle. Allow the fabric to hang dry, or use a warm setting. Fold the fabric in half, and set a pair of pajama pants on top. Fold your fabric in half along the grain with the wrong side facing out.
