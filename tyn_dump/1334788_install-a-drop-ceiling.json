Putting in the Grid System Cut the main runners to fit the length of your room perpendicular to the joists. The main runners will support the bulk of the weight of your ceiling. Measure the length of your room that runs perpendicular to the wooden joists of your ceiling. Cut the runners with a pair of tin snips to the correct length.
