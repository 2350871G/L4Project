        "Use an enzyme-based cleaner formulate for wood floors.",
        "An enzyme-based cleaner is the best way to help you remove odor from your floors, but wood floors need a gentler formula than carpet.",
        "Use an enzyme-based cleaner formulated for wood floors by wetting the sprayed area with the cleaner and allowing it to air dry.",
        "You may want to test the cleaner on a small area of your floor before applying it to a highly visible place to ensure it won't cause any damage.",
        "Enzyme-based cleaners should not be used directly on untreated wood or subflooring, as this could cause damage.",
        "Sand the wood down and refinish.",
        "If the stain is not dissipating, you have the option of sanding down your wood floor.",
        "This is not to be undertaken lightly because it is expensive and time consuming, but it may be the best option to remove very deep staining.",
        "Sanding removes the top layer of wood and will effectively polish out the spray by buffing away the surface layer it lives in.",
        "Contact a professional contractor for a quote to perform this work without damaging your floor.",
        "Sanding is simpler to do with unfinished wood (a deck, for example) but can be accomplished with finished hardwood inside.",
        "A professional can help you match your existing finish properly.",
        "A contractor can replace and paint a piece of your baseboard if necessary.",
        "If the spray sunk deep into the wood, a contractor can also help you replaced smelly or damaged areas.",
        "Preventing Cat Spraying Spay or neuter your cat.",
        "Spraying is a natural mating behavior in intact cats.",
        "The easiest solution to problem spraying is to neuter or spay your cat before 5 months of age if you haven\u2019t already.",
        "Your cat\u2019s urge to spray should drop off dramatically.",
        "Address any stressful changes in the environment.",
        "Changes in your cat\u2019s environment, such as a new cat or new baby, may seem small to you but they could feel upsetting for your cat.",
        "Try to address any new environmental shifts by providing slow introductions to new people and keeping your cat\u2019s routines as close to normal as possible.",
        "Get your cat checked at the vet for any underlying health problems.",
        "If your cat\u2019s urination problems persist despite its being neutered and your addressing environmental issues, you may want to take them to the vet.",
        "Some health problems, such as neutering complications or urinary tract infections, can cause your cat to urinate more frequently outside the litter box.",
        "Make a note of where your cat goes in the house, how often, and when your issues started so you can relate them to your veterinarian.",
        "Look for litter box-related issues.",
        "Cats are naturally inclined to use a litter box, so if your cat is avoiding theirs, there may be a reason for it.",
        "Try changing the location of the litter box or the litter you use.",
        "If you have multiple cats, make sure there are enough litter boxes so that each cat has one.",
        "Use repellent products as necessary.",
        "Certain repellent products, such as Four Paws Keep Off!",
        "and Nature\u2019s Miracle Pet Block Repellent, can discourage your cat from spraying in the house.",
        "Test your materials for colorfastness, and then spray the repellant thoroughly on the area your cat urinates."
