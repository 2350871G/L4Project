Signboard is a great option, but if you can\u2019t get it, sanded plywood or medium-density fiberboard will also work. A common size is 4 by 4 feet (120 by 120 cm), but you can make your barn quilt whatever size you want. A smaller one is an easy way to start. A lumberyard or a home supply store are good places to look for plywood."
