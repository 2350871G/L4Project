Dolphins and whales may thrash about unpredictably while beached, and their powerful tails and snouts may cause injury. Marine animals also carry diseases which can transfer to humans. For these reasons, you should always keep at least 150 feet away from beached animals unless specifically instructed to do otherwise by a trained professional. Do not allow children or pets near beached marine animals. This can add undue stress to the animal. If a trained professional requests your aid, remove watches and jewelry which might damage the animal\u2019s skin before approaching."
