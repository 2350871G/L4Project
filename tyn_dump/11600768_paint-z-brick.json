Darker paint colours typically require more coats than lighter colours. To err on the side of caution, or if you\u2019re unsure, apply at least 2 coats of paint to your wall. Clean up your workspace and take off all the painter\u2019s tape. Once you've applied all the paint you need, it\u2019s time to clean your workspace. Pick up all the drop cloths or tarps you put down. For the drop cloths, run them through the washer and dryer before storing them away. Carefully rip off all the painter\u2019s tape you used. Go slowly when removing the painter\u2019s tape. If you put cardboard on the floor below the wall you painted, you can put it in the recycling if it didn\u2019t get a lot of paint on it (otherwise, it\u2019ll be considered garbage). If you had to move any furniture to paint the wall, move it back to where it was. If you removed covers or light fixture, reinstall them back in place.",

        " Cleaning the Brick Veneer Scrub build-up from the brick veneer using a heavy-duty cleaner.",
        "In order to get the best possible adherence of paint to the brick veneer, the veneer should be completely clean and free of any built-up substances.",
        "Start by scrubbing the brick veneer with a heavy-duty cleaner while wearing rubber gloves.",
        "Make sure to scrub the mortar between the bricks in addition to the bricks themselves.",
        "A heavy-duty cleaner is one that is typically found at a hardware or home improvement store.",
        "It\u2019s stronger than everyday cleaners you\u2019d find in a grocery store.",
        "If the brick veneer is located inside a kitchen or garage, you may want to use a heavy-duty degreaser to remove any built-up grease, rather than just a cleaner.",
        "Mix a TSP solution for more extreme cleaning requirements if needed.",
        "For really dirty brick veneer walls or walls that have some really hard-to-remove substance, mix up a solution of TSP in order to wash the wall a second time.",
        "Add \u20444 cup (59 mL) of TSP to 1 US gal (3.8 L) of warm water in a bucket.",
        "Add 1  c (240 mL) of bleach to the TSP solution if your brick veneer also has mildew or mould on it.",

        "This will help to protect the lawn and plants from being damaged.",
        "Rinse off all cleaners from the brick veneer with plain water.",
        "For interior walls, add clean warm water to a bucket and use a sponge or cloth to rinse the brick veneer.",

        "You do not want any of the TSP solution left on the brick veneer before you paint.",
        "Continue to wear rubber gloves while rinsing the brick veneer.",
        "Allow the brick veneer to dry for 24 hours before proceeding.",
        "Once all washing and rinsing are complete, allow the brick veneer to dry for at least 24 hours before moving to the next step.",
        "If you live in a humid area, you may need to wait longer than 24 hours for the veneer to completely dry.",
        "For exterior walls, you will also want to ensure the weather will be dry for several days in a row before applying primer and paint.",
        "Do not apply any primer or paint to the brick veneer when it\u2019s still damp.",
        "The primer will seal in the moisture, which will ruin the brick.",
        "Setting up Your Workspace Protect the area around the brick veneer wall with drop cloths.",
        "For exterior walls, put drop cloths or tarps on the ground beneath the wall, as well as on shrubs and plants near the wall.",
        "For interior walls, put drop cloths on the floor below the wall, or tape pieces of cardboard to the floor (with painter\u2019s tape) to protect it.",
        "For both indoor and outdoor walls, you may also want to cover any nearby furniture with drop cloths to protect it from paint splatters.",
        "Use painter\u2019s tape to protect all four edges of the brick veneer wall.",
        "For exterior walls, this may not be necessary if you\u2019re painting an entire side (or multiple sides) of your home.",
        "For interior walls, you\u2019ll want to put a layer of painter\u2019s tape along each edge of the wall in case any of your brush strokes are slightly off.",
        "You may want to put an extra-wide layer of painter\u2019s tape on the ceiling above the wall to be painted, in case the paint roller touches the ceiling.",
        "You\u2019ll also want to either remove or use tape to protect covers for light switches, outlets, or vents if there are any on the wall you\u2019re painting.",
        "Ventilate the room where you\u2019ll be painting.",
        "If you\u2019re painting indoors, make sure the doors and windows of the room are open.",
        "If the room has a vent fan (such as a kitchen or bathroom), make sure the fan is on while your painting and while the paint is drying.",
        "If needed, plug-in a portable fan in the room where you\u2019re going to paint so that it moves the air out of the room.",
        "If you\u2019re able to get a cross-breeze going, by opening windows or doors on opposite sides of your home, it will naturally ventilate the air as you work.",
        "Priming the Brick Veneer Use masonry bonding primer to ensure the paint will adhere to the brick.",
        "Visit your local hardware or home improvement store and look for a masonry bonding primer.",
        "It should be found in the paint section with the other primers but will be labelled that it\u2019s specifically designed for masonry.",
        "Bonding primer contains ingredients that will not only properly seal masonry (like brick), but will ensure regular (interior or exterior) paint will \u2018stick\u2019 to the masonry.",
        "Due to its speciality nature, you may need to go to a paint store to find masonry bonding primer if you can\u2019t find it at a hardware or home improvement store.",
        "Apply 1-coat of masonry bonding primer to the brick veneer.",
        "Use a paint roller designed specifically for textured surfaces to apply the masonry bonding primer to the brick veneer wall.",
        "Apply an even layer of bonding primer to the entire wall, including the mortar between the bricks.",
        "Allow the masonry bonding primer to dry before proceeding to the next step.",
        "Read and manufacturer\u2019s instructions to determine the proper drying time for the bonding primer you purchased.",
        "Determine if you\u2019ll need to use regular primer on your brick veneer wall.",
        "Masonry bonding primer ensures the paint will adhere to the brick, but 1-coat of bonding primer may not be enough to cover the dark colour of the underlying brick veneer.",
        "If the brick veneer is dark in colour, but the paint you\u2019re using on the wall is light, you\u2019ll need another coat or two of \u2018regular\u2019 primer in order to cover the colour of the brick completely.",
        "While you could use multiple layers of masonry bonding primer, it is more expensive than regular primer and isn\u2019t necessary.",
        "Make sure you get an interior primer for inside walls and exterior primer for outside walls.",
        "Make sure you also get the type of primer you need for the type of paint you\u2019re using.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re using oil-based paint, use an oil-based primer.",
        "Use a paint roller to apply 1-coat of regular paint primer if needed.",
        "If you\u2019ve decided you need \u2018regular\u2019 primer in addition to the masonry bonding primer, use a paint roller (again, one designed for textured surfaces) and apply 1-coat of regular primer at a time.",
        "Allow the primer to dry and assess if you need a second coat of primer.",
        "Keep in mind that you can add more layers of paint, instead of primer, if needed.",
        "Read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to determine the exact drying time of the regular primer you\u2019re using.",
        "Assessing the need for additional layers of primer should be based on how much of the brick\u2019s colour is still showing through and how light the paint colour is that you choose.",
        "Apply primer to the mortar between the bricks using a paintbrush.",
        "Use a paintbrush to fill in all the nooks and crannies in the mortar between the bricks with primer.",
        "If you only used the masonry bonding primer, use it again for this step.",
        "If you also used regular primer, use that regular primer again for this step.",
        "Use inexpensive paintbrushes for this step, as the process will likely ruin any brushes you use.",
        "Allow the primer enough time to dry between coats.",
        "Oil-based primers can take at least an hour to be dry to the touch, whereas, latex primers can take between 1-2 hours to be dry to the touch.",
        "To be safe, wait at least 2 hours between coats of primer.",
        "You can touch the wall with your fingers to feel for tackiness.",
        "If the primer is still tacky, wait longer before adding another coat.",
        "Once the primer layers are complete, wait at least 24 hours before applying the first paint layer.",
        "Read the instructions on the primer you\u2019re using to confirm the dry times for the specific product you purchased.",
        "Take this timing into account when painting an outside wall, as you may need to wait longer between coats if it\u2019s really humid or if it rains.",
        "Painting the Brick Veneer Select the type and colour of the paint you\u2019ll be using.",
        "Indoor walls should be painted with interior paint, while outdoors walls should be painted with exterior paint.",
        "The brick veneer wall can be painted to match the rest of the room or home, or it can be used as an accent wall and painted a completely different colour.",
        "You will also need to determine if you\u2019d prefer a flat paint, eggshell or satin paint, or semi-gloss paint.",
        "Due to the textured nature of a brick veneer wall, selecting a flat paint is probably your best option for both an inside and outside wall.",
        "If you can\u2019t decide between a couple of different colours, purchase sample paint pots of each colour and test them at home.",
        "Flat paint hides most imperfections but is the least stain-resistant.",
        "Eggshell and satin paint are best for smooth walls, where the slight shine of the paint will not accentuate imperfections.",
        "Semi-gloss and gloss paints are best as trim paint or for bathroom walls.",
        "Apply the first coat of paint and allow it to dry.",
        "Use a paintbrush to apply a coat of paint to the edges of the wall and the mortar between the bricks.",
        "Use a paint roller to apply a coat of paint to the entire walls, up to the trim you painted with the brush.",
        "Allow the wall to dry completely before assessing if one coat was sufficient.",
        "OIl-based paints can take up to 24 hours to completely dry.",
        "Latex paints can take between 2 and 4 hours to completely dry.",
        "Review the instructions on the can of paint you purchased to confirm the manufacturer\u2019s suggested drying time.",
        "Assess if you\u2019ll need additional coats of paint on the wall.",
        "Once the first coat of paint has been applied and is completely dry, assess the wall to determine if you\u2019ll need to apply a second coat.",
        "Can you still see the primer through the paint?",
        "Can you still see the brick colour through the paint?",
        "Can you easily make out the brush strokes?",
        "If you answered yes to any of these questions, you\u2019re going to need at least one more coat of paint.",
        "Paint will change colour as it dries, therefore you\u2019ll want to make sure the paint is completely dry before you assess whether another coat is needed.",
        "However, as you\u2019re applying the first coat of paint it may be obvious that you\u2019ll need a second coat of paint, in which case, you only need to wait until the paint is dry to the touch before applying a second coat.",
        "Add a second coat of paint to the wall if required.",
        "If you\u2019ve assessed that at least one more layer of paint is required, apply it now.",
