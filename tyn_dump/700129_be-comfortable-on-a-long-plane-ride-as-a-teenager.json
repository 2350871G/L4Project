If you have glasses, wear them, but you can always bring contacts when you get to your destination. This can save you from dry eyes, and you can sleep in comfort."

Don't buy soda, because that can get you all jittery. If you want carbonated drinks, buy ginger ale instead. When you are at the airport, or buy one from the dollar store, get a bag of lollipops. Dumdums are good because they are small and don't have much sugar.. If you don't like lollipops, then bring some M&Ms or skittles. Sucking on sweets can reduce stress a little."

Get an aisle seat, if you want leg room, or a window seat, if you want to sleep. When you are seated, and don't like your seat, look for an empty row.
