    "text": " Compass Find a drafting compass. You can buy one at office supply or drafting supply stores. Put your pencil in the open leg of the compass.  Adjust the compass for the radius of your circle. For a bigger circle, spread the compass wider. Set the stationary leg of the compass where you want the middle of the circle.  Keep the stationary leg stable as you move the pencil leg around in a circle.  Pencil Tip Choose a well-sharpened pencil.  Choose a piece of paper. Place the paper on a flat, clean surface. The easier the surface is to move the paper on, the better, such as a well-polished table. Also, be sure to have plenty of space to be able to move the paper on the work surface. Place the pencil on the paper. Press down on the point where the exposed wood on the pencil meets the painted part. Have the tip of the pencil touch the paper, so that the eraser end is sticking up.  Rotate the paper. While your index finger is holding the edge of the pencil described in Step 3, rotate the paper beneath the pencil with your free hand. Continue the rotation until a full circle is formed.  Congratulations! You have now completed your circle. Square Draw a square.  Divide the square equally into 4 smaller squares using a pencil and ruler.  Draw round lines in one smaller square. Start from one end of a bisecting line and take the half circle shape up to the next bisecting line, with the rounded edge sitting against the edge of the large outer square. Repeat for each small square until one large circle has been created inside the large square.  Erase the square lines. Leave behind the circle.",
