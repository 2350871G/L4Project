Purchase flowers and greenery of a variety of sizes and shapes that fit the color scheme you have chosen for your wedding. Also gather floral tape, wire and any embellishments you\u2019d like to include, such as ribbon, fabric, berries, etc. Selections of larger blooms, like roses, peonies, or calla lilies, mixed in with smaller, hanging bunches, like baby\u2019s breath or jasmine, provide textural interest along with sprigs of long, trailing greenery. Look for flowers that come as single stems, with wire that runs the length of the stem and into the leaves, and a matte finish. These will look more realistic and be easier to work with.

This globe-shaped bouquet is created by bunching similarly shaped and colored blooms tightly together. You can also make them all one flower type if you desire a uniform, formal look. Select 4-6 pieces of greenery or other accents to place in between the blooms, if desired. Larger blooms, like roses, tulips, hydrangeas, or peonies work well in the round bouquet. Flowers made from polyester and plastic are cheaper to make and thus are less costly and more widely available. Polyester or rayon flowers come in a wide range of colors, sizes, and types but they may not always look as realistic up close. Silk or cotton flowers are generally more expensive, higher-quality alternatives. They often come in single stems only and tend to look more realistic."

Tape these together with 3-4 wraps of floral tape at the base of the blooms. Rotate the bouquet in your hand as you add additional blooms, building it in concentric, outward circles until it reaches the size you want. Attach each stem individually to the main stems of the bouquet by wrapping it several times near the base of the blooms. One design option while building your bouquet is to use different colors or blooms in each layer of the circle to create a distinctive and formal look. Consider a layered look with white roses at the center and red tulips in the outer circle, for example. Wrapping each stem as you go helps give you the signature round bouquet look of tightly-bunched flowers shaped into a dome or partial sphere."

Tie a strong knot in the loose ends and then pull the folded side of the ribbon all the way through. Cut a piece of ribbon that will be the length you want after doubling it and running it through the middle of your sphere. For example, if you want a 12 in (30 cm) drop, cut 36 in (91 cm) of ribbon.

Whether it\u2019s tucking in additional greenery or adding sprigs of berries, beads, or feathers, think creatively about your final design. Attach a frame of greenery around the outside of your round or cascade bouquet by taping the additional stems to the existing bouquet. Insert greenery, feathers, ribbons or beads by sticking them into the tied stem of the round or cascade bouquet. Fill in gaps in your pomander by sticking additional flowers, sprigs of dried or fake berries, or greens into the spaces around your flowers. Make your bouquet your own with materials that uniquely represent you. Some unique and non-traditional elements might include LEGOS, tiny gears (for a steampunk fan), paintbrushes, circuit board elements, or colored pencils. Spray with glitter or floral scents. A finishing spray that adds some sparkle or even some floral scents can help add the final touches to your bouquet. Place the bouquet on a flat surface and, holding the spray 10\u201312 in (25\u201330 cm) away from it, dust it lightly with floral glitter spray. Do the same for any scent you\u2019d like to use, whether it\u2019s lavender mist or your favorite perfume. Just because you have used artificial flowers doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t smell nice!",
