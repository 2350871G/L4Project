                    "description": "As soon as a lamb is born, it should drink a large amount of colostrum, which is the first milk that comes from mother sheep after birth. It is unlike normal milk because it is full of protein, fats, and antibodies that help a lamb thrive. Getting your lamb to drink colostrum should be a priority immediately after birth. Colostrum from other sheep or cows can be given to lambs. If you can get fresh or frozen colostrum that is ideal. Supplements are typically available at farm supply stores or websites but are considered less effective. Your lamb should have about 500 milliliters (17  fl oz) of good quality colostrum over the first day of its life. This should be fed over the course of 6 to 8 feedings. Ask a veterinarian who is knowledgeable about caring for sheep how much colostrum to give per feeding. Your veterinarian may also be able to tell you where to get colostrum, such as some local farms that have some stored up. If you get frozen colostrum, make sure that you thaw it out in hot to warm water. Do not microwave the colostrum because this can damage the antibodies and proteins in it."

Slowly put the nipple of the bottle in the lamb's mouth and move the lamb's jaw up and down in order to press the nipple together so that milk comes out. After about three or four times of opening and closing the animal's jaw, the lamb should catch on and suck regularly. If your lamb does not catch on, you should consult with a veterinarian. They may suggest the use of a feeding tube if your lamb is in desperate need of nutrition. You can test your lamb\u2019s suckle reflex with your finger. If you offer your finger to the lamb, he should try to latch onto your finger and have a moderate to strong desire to nurse on your finger. If your lamb doesn\u2019t have a strong suckle reflex, then consult a veterinarian. Do not attempt to bottle feed a lamb that can\u2019t suckle.
