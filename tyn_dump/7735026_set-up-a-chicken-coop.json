If your chickens aren't going to be free-range (let out to roam in the garden) then you need to purchase a coop with an attached run. You can find chicken coops online, in pet shops or at nearby ranch supply stores. Second-hand coops will be found at a cheaper cost but if you have a large budget, take a look around at a pet shop in town. A standard chicken needs 4 square foot of floor space in the coop and 8 square foot in the run. Bantams only need half; so 2 square foot in the coop and 4 square foot in the run. Set up the coop once delivered. What is meant by setting up the coop is constructing it if it wasn't bought set-up already."
