The other type of the pulsative slide is the same thing but instead of releasing and pressing the brake button , press the accelerate button. This may sound a bit weird and you will wonder where you have to use it. I can tell you: Nadeo Pro A-1 - The long turn after the second small jump (into the loop parts) you will need a long fast slide to do the first curve and directly afterwards you will need a slow 'n' short one. So you'll start with a powerslide and release the accelerate button when arriving at the harder turn and go back to accelerating after the turn immediately. You will need very very much speed to do this. Important to say is that you can only \"pulsate\" while there are at least 3 braking stripes on the ground visible ( sounds weird, but you'll see)"

Sliding helps you to get the curves faster. Some may say that sliding is useless because the only thing that happens is that your back is breaking out. Well that is right, but they just didn't try to do it, or don't have the required experience to do so. The following points describe the different types of slides you will need to make everyone (or ALMOST everyone) swallowing your dust.  Basic/Beginner Slide - nearly every(including me) player begins the sliding thing with the basic slide i.e. braking without accelerating. It is needed on really hard curves. You will need very much speed when sliding, so look for a curve where you will arrive very fast. Press your turn button and after that hit the brake. Look to it that you first turn and THEN brake , otherwise the car won't slide.

It is hard to find the right slide for the right curve, but sooner or later you will get to know what to use where. Pulsative Slide - This is a very tricky slide.
