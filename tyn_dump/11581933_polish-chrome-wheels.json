                    "description": "Before you can polish your wheels, clean them off to ensure that you don\u2019t trap any dirt or grime in the surface of your chrome. Fill a bucket with warm or lukewarm water. Then, squirt car soap into the water. Use roughly 1  fl oz (30 mL) of car soap for every 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water.Variation: Instead of using soap and water, you can use a foam wheel spray. Get a can of foam wheel spray from an auto parts store and apply the spray by holding the can 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm) away from the wheel. Shake the can as you apply it and wait 3-5 seconds after applying the spray for the foam to expand before rinsing it off. Don\u2019t worry about it if you use too little or too much soap. So long as the water is a little bubbly, you should be fine. It\u2019s best to do this in your driveway or on a quiet street since you\u2019re going to be applying a lot of water to your wheels. You\u2019re going to end up with a damp and humid garage if you do this indoors."

Start on the exterior edge of your rims and work your way towards the center of the wheel to apply soap to each surface. You can use a thick towel if you prefer. This may be a better option if you have a wheel with more than 5-6 individual spokes since it\u2019s easier to wrap a cloth around a spoke. Don\u2019t worry about cleaning areas behind the rim that you can\u2019t see. However, you can clean these areas if you\u2019d like. Reload your sponge as needed to keep it wet and soapy."

Use the tip of your brush to your clean around your lug nuts as well. These nuts can be kind of hard to clean around, but you\u2019re better off keeping them on the wheel as you do this.
