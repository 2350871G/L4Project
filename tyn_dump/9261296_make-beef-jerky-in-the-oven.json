    "text": " Preparing the Meat Trim the fat off the meat. Use a sharp paring knife to carefully trim any of the white fat or tendons from the red steak. Fat will make your jerky overly chewy and will cause the jerky to spoil faster. Remove as much of the fat as you can before moving onto the next step. Place the meat in a freezer for two hours. Wrap the meat in plastic wrap first, then place it in your freezer. A partially frozen steak will be easier to cut than a non-frozen steak. Cut the meat into 1\u20448 to 1\u20444 inch-thick (0.32 to 0.64 cm) strips. Lay the meat out on a cutting board and start to cut thin strips of meat from the steak with a chef's knife.

Cut against the grain for a more traditional chewy texture or with the grain for a more sinewy texture. Try to slice the meat so each piece is a uniform size. Marinating the Meat Pour the liquid ingredients to a cooking dish. Pour the half cup (118.3 ml) of soy sauce and the \u00bc cup (59.1 ml) of sesame oil into a cooking dish or a large bowl. Mix the liquids together until they are well incorporated. Add the dry ingredients to the mixture. Use a measuring spoon to add 1/4 cup (1 g) of brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons (6.3 g) of powdered ginger, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sesame seeds, and 2 teaspoons (8.4 g) of ground pepper to the mixture. Use a spoon or a fork to mix all of the ingredients together until they are well incorporated. Place the strips of meat into your marinade and cover it. Place the beef into the marinade and mix the pieces around so that they get covered in the mixture. Cover the top of the cooking dish with plastic wrap or an airtight lid. Place the steak in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. As the meat sits in the refrigerator, it will start to soak up the marinade and impart the flavors from the spices and soy sauce mixture into your jerky. The longer that you soak the meat in the marinade, the more flavorful your jerky will be. If you\u2019re in a rush, you can leave the meat soaking in the marinade for three hours. Cooking the Jerky Remove the meat from the marinade and dry it off with paper towels. Remove the bowl or the cooking dish from the refrigerator and lay the slices of meat onto a paper towel. Use more paper towels to blot over the surface of the meat and remove as much moisture as you can. Leave the meat out for an hour so it can warm up to room temperature. Place the beef onto a cooking sheet lined in tin foil. The cooking sheet will be what your jerky cooks on. Do not let the jerky overlap or it won\u2019t cook evenly. Preheat your oven to 145\u2013175 \u00b0F (63\u201379 \u00b0C). If your oven doesn't go that low in temperature, set it to as low as your oven will go. You\u2019ll have to cook the steak at a low temperature over a long period of time so that it dries out and becomes jerky. Put the beef into the oven and cook it for 3-8 hours.
