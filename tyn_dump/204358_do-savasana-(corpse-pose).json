You should look for a quiet, dark place that will allow you to focus on your breathing and meditation. You might need to move to another room than the one you used to perform your previous poses if you have many distractions or can't relax. If you are in a class, your instructor may darken the lights in the room as you relax. Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature. Extreme temperatures in heat or cold could distract you from the mental benefits of the pose. You must also have a comfortable surface to lie on. Generally, you will need a yoga mat or towels to give you a buffer on hardwood floors. You might want to avoid practicing this pose on concrete or tile floors without a mat."
