It is often easiest to add the flour 1 tablespoon at a time, using your whisk to quickly break up chunks and smooth out the sauce. You should notice it thickening. The longer you cook the flour, the darker and richer it will get. For a light gravy, move on as it turns tan. For a rich brown gravy, keep stirring and cook for an extra 3-5 minutes. Butter and flour give the gravy its thick, rich base. You can add more of both for a richer, thicker gravy, keeping the 2 cups of liquid the same, but keep the ratio of flour and butter equal."

Deglazing is when you use a cool liquid to clean a hot pan, removing the flavorful, caramelized bits and adding them to your sauce or gravy. Whisk in 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of flour, one at a time. Using a wire whisk, add the flour slowly with one hand while whisking with the other. You want to make a smooth, consistent sauce. Keep whisking until you've removed all the lumps.
