    "text": " Preparing for Installation Put up the camper most of the way. It should be low enough that the canvas is loose enough to remove from the track around the top. Remove the valence, if you have one and want to. It will make it much easier to work around the area; however, it will leave rusty staple marks/staples, depending upon the age and condition of the camper. Unscrew the canvas. If your canvas is attached in another way, undo that. You might find that you need to repeat this step later on if you don't unscrew enough of it. Remove the canvas. You don't need to remove it all, just the canvas near where you're installing the mount. Remove the canvas track. Again, you only need to remove it starting from the corner, where it ends. If it's only stapled like in the Jayco 1207, you can remove it with a flat head screwdriver, using another handle as leverage. Use needlenose pliers and a small flat head screwdriver to remove the staples from the plastic. Installing the Mounts Add the mount. It goes behind the track and behind the canvas. Slide the mount in the correct distance. Two feet (60cm) from the end of the camper works well, unless you want it to be closer to your A/C unit. Be sure to measure this distance and keep it the same for the mount on the other side of the camper. Drill the top hole. While holding the mount in place, move the plastic track out of the way and mark with a pencil through the top hole. Remove the mount and drill a 3/32\" (2.4mm) wide, 1/4\" (6 mm) deep starter hole in the roof. Screw the mount to the ceiling using a #8\u00d73/4\" flat head screw.  Drill the wall hole. Drill a 1/4\" (6.5 mm) hole through the premade hole in the mount and the wall of the camper. Prepare the bolt. Screw a 1/4\" bonded sealing washer onto 1/4\"-20\u00d71\" round head machine screw. Bolt the mount to the wall with a 1/4\"-20 nylon lock nut. It helps to have a person on the outside with a screwdriver and a person on the inside with pliers or a wrench. Make sure the nut is on the inside and the washer is on the exterior. Completing the Installation Restaple the plastic track around the mount, being sure to push it back up to the ceiling.  Put the canvas back in the track and re-insert the screws. You may want to replace your screws if they are rusted (#8\u00d73/4\" flat head screws work well). Repeat the above steps for each corner.  Attach the bar to the mounts with 1/4\"-20\u00d71\" round head machine screws. The mounts are pre-threaded for this. Repeat the above step for each of the four mounts. ",
