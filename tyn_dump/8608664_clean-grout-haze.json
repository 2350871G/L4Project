If you are cleaning grout haze off of tiles that have recently been installed, wait a day for the grout to set. This will allow the grout to firm up so it is not damaged when you are removing the grout haze. This is key if you have smooth tiles made of glazed ceramic or porcelain. Talk to the professional floor installer to find out the setting time for the grout. Most cement and ready-mixed grouts dry within 24 hours."

Wet the terry towel and wring out as much water as you can before you use it. This will ensure excess water does not get on the grout.
