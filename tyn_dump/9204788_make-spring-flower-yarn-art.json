        "Tie a piece of colored yarn to one of the nails on the outside of the flower.",
        "Choose a color that you think would look nice on a flower, such as red, pink, purple or blue.",
        "Use fine or medium-weight yarn.",
        "Cross the yarn over to a nail on the opposite side of the flower.",
        "If you added a center to the flower, wrap the yarn around that instead.",
        "Keep crossing the yarn from nail to nail until the flower is filled.",
        "You don't have to cross the yarn to the opposite nail every time; you can cross it over to the third nail over (skipping one in between).",
        "Weave the yarn around the nails to create the outline.",
        "Pull the yarn over and under through the nails until you are back where you started.",
        "If you want a thicker outline, go one more time around the flower: under and over this time.",
        "Knot and cut the yarn.",
        "Once you are happy with your flower, wrap the yarn around the nail a few times, then tie it in a double knot.",
        "Snip off the excess yarn.",
        "Do the center and leaves, if you added them.",
        "Use yellow for the center and green for the leaves.",
        "If you make your flower yellow, consider using orange, brown, or black yarn for the center.",
        "Remember to outline the center and leaves when you are done, and to knot and cut off the tails."
