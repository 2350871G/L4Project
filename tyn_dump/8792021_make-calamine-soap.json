Some types of melt-and-pour soap bases have cutting guidelines, which you can use. Make sure that you are using the melt-and-pour type of soap base, as regular bars of soap from the store won't melt. You can find melt-and-pour soap bases in the craft store and online. You can also use 12 ounces (340.2 grams) of white glycerin melt-and-pour soap base instead. Melt-and-pour soap is a great way to get started in soap making because you won't be working with lye, which can be dangerous."

        "If you use a round or square mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars after it dries.",
        "For a more unique mold, cut off the bottom 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) of six water bottles, and use that instead.",
        "If the mixture forms bubbles, spray the surface with rubbing alcohol.",
        "This will make the bubbles disappear.",
        "Allow the soap to cool and dry.",
        "This will take 30 minutes if you are using several small molds.",
        "It may take up to several hours if you are using one big mold.",
        "De-mold the soap.",
        "Simply turn the mold over, and pop the soap out.",
        "You may have to wiggle the sides to loosen the soap.",
        "If you used a large mold, such as a round or square PVC mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars.",
        "You should be able to make 3 to 4 bars.",
        "Once you pop the soap out of the molds, it is ready to use!",
        "If you used plastic water bottles as molds, you'll need to cut the bottles apart with a craft blade, then slide the soap out.",
        "Making Cold Process Soap Protect yourself and your work surface.",
        "You will be working with lye, which can be dangerous if not handled properly.",
        "Put on a pair of goggles, a mask, rubber gloves, and along sleeved shirt.",
        "Have an accurate, digital scale ready.",
        "Your measurements must be precise, or they may not saponify properly.",
        "You will use the scale to measure everything, including the liquid ingredients.",
        "This recipe will make a lot of soap.",
        "You can resize this recipe to make a smaller amount, but you will need to use an accurate soap-making calculator to convert the amounts.",
        "Prepare the water and lye solution.",
        "Measure and pour 38 ounces (1123.79 grams) of cool water into a large pitcher first.",
        "Next, measure out 15 ounces (425.25 grams) of lye and sprinkle it into the water.",
        "Let it heat to 200\u00b0F (94\u00b0C), then stir with spoon for 30 seconds to dissolve the lye.",
        "Never add water directly into lye, as this will cause the lye to erupt.",
        "Use a pitcher designated specifically for this purpose.",
        "Do not reuse this cup for anything else.",
        "There are different types of lye used for soap making.",
        "You want to use Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH).",
        "Set the lye solution aside so that it can cool down.",
        "Cover the pitcher with lid, then place it some place where it won't tip over.",
        "Let the solution cool down to 100 and 125\u00b0F (38 to 52\u00b0C).",
        "This can take 30 min to 2 hours.",
        "Melt the oils and butters.",
        "You will need: 2 pounds (907.2 grams) coconut oil, 2 pounds (907.2 grams) olive oil, 1 pound 6 ounces (623.7 grams) soybean oil, 1 pound 2 ounces (510.3 grams) palm oil, 0.8 ounces (22.68 grams) coco butter, and 0.4 ounces (11.34 grams) shea butter.",
        "You can do this in a large pot or in a double-boiler, if you can find one big enough.",
        "Heat them up to somewhere 100 and 125\u00b0F (38 to 52\u00b0C).",
        "Stir the cooled lye solution into the oil and butter mixture.",
        "Wait for the oil and butter mixture to cool down to at least 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C), then pour in the cooled lye solution.",
        "Mix everything together using a stick blender set to low speed.",
        "Keep the blender near the bottom of the pot.",
        "Be careful so that the mixture doesn't splash.",
        "It hasn't saponified yet, so it is still caustic and can cause burns.",
        "Wait for the mixture to trace.",
        "Trace happens after 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "It will turn runny and pudding like.",
        "If the blender leaves marks on the surface when you pull it out, you're at trace.",
        "Be prepared to work quickly during the next few steps as the mixture will start to harden.",
        "Add the prepared dye to the mixture.",
        "Mix about 1 teaspoon of red iron oxide dye with \u00bd tablespoon of glycerin or olive oil.",
        "Stir it into the soap mixture until it is almost the same color as calamine lotion.",
        "Don't worry if the mixture looks a little dark.",
        "The zinc oxide in the next step will help lighten it up.",
        "You may not end up using all of your prepared dye.",
        "Stir in the zinc oxide.",
        "You will need between \u00bd and \u00be cups (663.28 and 994.91 grams).",
        "Keep adding the zinc oxide until the mixture is the same color as calamine lotion.",
        "Combined with the iron oxide, the zinc oxide will help make your skin less itchy.",
        "Both zinc oxide and iron oxide are important ingredients in calamine lotion.",
        "Stir in the essential oils.",
        "You will need 4 ounces (113.4 grams) total.",
        "You can use any fragrance or combination of fragrances you what.",
        "A combination of chamomile, lavender, and tea tree would work especially well.",
        "Pour the mixture into an 8-pound (3.6-kilogram) soap making mold.",
        "You can also use several smaller molds instead.",
        "Some molds will need to be lined with parchment paper or plastic wrap first.",
        "Other molds, usually those made from silicone, do not need to be prepared.",
        "Tap bottom of mold against counter to release any bubbles.",
        "Some people like to leave the top of the soap bumpy.",
        "If you want it smoother, run a spoon over it.",
        "Cover the soap with plastic wrap and blankets, then wait 24 hours.",
        "Wrap some plastic wrap over the mold(s) first, then cover them with blankets and quilts.",
        "This will keep the soap insulated while it hardens and saponifies.",
        "you can take a peek every now and then.",
        "If you see a crack forming on the soap, it's getting too hot.",
        "Remove the blankets.",
        "De-mold, cut, and cure the soap.",
        "Remove the soap from the mold(s) first, then cut it into bars.",
        "Spread the bars out on a baking sheet.",
        "Place them some place where they won't be disturbed.",
        "Let them cure for 4 weeks.",
        "After 4 weeks, the soap will have saponified.",
        "It's ready to be used!"
