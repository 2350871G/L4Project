                    "description": "While both powder and liquid foundations provide great coverage, powder foundation tends to be easier to apply evenly. Unlike liquid foundation, which needs to be applied and blended with precision, you can easily apply powder foundation all over your face with a large Kabuki brush without needing to see what you are doing. It is also much more difficult to over-apply powder foundation. With liquid foundation, on the other hand, too much makeup in one area can result in a caked-on look. If you do choose to use a liquid foundation, using a blending sponge all over your face after applying can help you even-out your foundation, though this may take some time and practice to perfect."

                    "description": "When you are learning how to apply your makeup without being able to see it, it can be helpful to start with more neutral tones that are similar to your natural skin tones, such as shades of beige or brown. Neutral tones are easier to blend, making your makeup appear seamless and any mistakes less obvious. For eyeshadow, you can try a neutral shade with a bit of gold shimmer. This will still appear seamless but will give you a bit more pizazz. For a neutral-toned blush, try a shade of pink or beige that is very similar to the natural rosiness in your cheeks."

                    "description": "When shopping for makeup, choose a pencil eyeliner over a liquid. Pencil eyeliners are much easier to control for a more precise application. In addition, unlike liquid eyeliners, if you make a mistake with a pencil eyeliner, you can easily use your finger or a small precision brush to smudge the liner to create a smoky eye look. If you want to ensure that your pencil eyeliner is precise, you can purchase makeup tape (or use any tape that doesn\u2019t irritate your skin) to place on your face and help guide you as you apply your eyeliner. To do this, find the corners of your eyes with your fingers and place the middle of the makeup tape just below your finger. Press the tape down to secure in place. You can now follow the top line of the tape to create a precise eyeliner look, such as a winged look or cat eyes."

While many lipsticks create stark lines along your lips, lip gloss colors are usually less pigmented and tend to fade more gradually from your lips to your skin.

Unlike a cream or stick highlighter, which both need to be blended, powder highlighter does not need to be applied with precision. All you need to do is run the brush through the powder, swipe it across your cheekbones, and you are ready to go."

Allergic reactions to makeup products are very common. In some cases, you may not be aware that you are having an adverse reaction without being able to see your face.
