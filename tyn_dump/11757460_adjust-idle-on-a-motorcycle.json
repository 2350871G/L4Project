You can use the tachometer to check your idle speed before doing this to determine if it\u2019s already within the ideal range.

If you see a nearby flathead screw, this is typically the air intake screw. While turning the air intake screw can be used to adjust the idle speed, this screw also controls the air flow when you\u2019re actively riding. As a consequence, it\u2019s generally not a good idea to mess with this screw. This screw could be on the left or right side of the bike. If you can\u2019t find it, try checking on the other side. On some fuel-injected motorcycles, there is a knob sticking out the side of your bike near the engine compartment.
