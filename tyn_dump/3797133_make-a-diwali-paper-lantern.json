If you can't get your hands on bamboo sticks, you may be able to find suitable alternatives, as long as they're thin but sturdy.

Don't be afraid to make your lantern bold! For more manageable sizes, cut the paper into 5-inch, 7-inch and 9-inch squares and rectangles. For stronger tissue paper, layer two sheets of the same color and glue their edges together. Color blocking, stripes, or diamond shapes will bring out the natural design of the lantern. Use a very thin layer of glue to glue edges together. Use tape if you like. Colored tape or even glittery tape can both stick the paper together and make them look good. Kids might enjoy drawing stories or scenes of their home and family on their paper. Crafty types might be interested in developing their designs even more, by using a penknife to cut out designs and layering two or more colors together."

Gather full- and half-length bamboo sticks, tape for measure/ruler, heavy duty thread, exacto-knife or sharp blade, and strong glue. Lay everything out on old newspapers so you don't damage the table you are working on. Make twelve corners. Create V-shaped frames. To do this, place two half-length bamboo sticks at 90 degree angle (a right angle) to one another, so that their ends overlap by \u00bc of an inch. Repeat twelve times. Glue them securely.

Tie off in a couple of slip knots. Dot thread with glue. Let glue dry completely. The length of the thread may vary depending on your exact design. Make a square-shaped framework with the V-shaped constructions. Take four pairs of the V-shaped corners, and repeat steps 3 and 4. Glue the tips of these and tie them to form a square-shaped frame. By the end of this step you should have two squares of equal size. Let glue dry completely. Make more squares. Since this is a square shaped lantern, you will need to make a cube shaped frame.

Glue each of the three remaining full-length bamboo sticks to one inner corners of the original square. Be sure to line them up at the marks, and support them in perpendicular shape while they are drying. Let glue dry completely. By the end of this step it should look like you have an upside down bamboo stick table with bamboo stick \"legs.\" Glue each of the four table \"legs\" to inner corners of second square. By the end of this step, you should have a rectangular box frame with four, one to two inch legs sticking out at each end. Let glue dry completely.

This creates a series of flexible diamonds that add dimension and prismatic depth to your Diwali lantern.

Affix a nail or hook and feed the electric cord with bulb through it, and note the distance between the bulb and nail/hook. Attaching Decorative Paper to Your Diwali Lantern Attach decorated paper to center areas. Starting with the central areas is easiest, and you can use your larger sheets of decorated paper here. Beginning with frames of the central squares (the ones made by the flexible squares) apply a very thin layer of glue to bamboo sticks. Lay decorated paper over it. Gently tap down.

Trim edges of paper with sharp blade. Attach paper to lower triangles with a thin layer of glue. Tap down. Let glue dry completely. Trim edges of paper with sharp blade or scissor if you like. Wrap ribbon around the top legs of lantern. Wrapping the ribbon will give the lantern a finished look. Secure with a knot and trim ends. Feel free to decorate the lantern how you like using different style of ribbons or strips. Wrap ribbon around the bottom legs of the lantern. Wrapping the ribbon here also finishes the look and provides a horizontal support to attach a fringe of ribbons. Make fringe on all four sides. Attach ribbons to lower strands of ribbon wrap. If tying the ribbon, use a cow-hitch knot. Hanging and Lighting Your Diwali Lantern Use heavy duty thread to hang lantern from nail or hook. This is the same nail or hook you are using to hang the electric cord and light socket. Adjust length so that the light hangs in the center of the lantern. Light it up! Now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor, and think about the triumph of light over darkness symbolized by your lantern! Use color-changing lights if you have them. This can make your white paper lantern look splendid. Use ones that aren't very flashy but are elegant and classy.",

        "By the end of this step it should look like you have an upside down bamboo stick table with bamboo stick \"legs.\"",
        "Glue each of the four table \"legs\" to inner corners of second square.",
        "By the end of this step, you should have a rectangular box frame with four, one to two inch legs sticking out at each end.",
        "Let glue dry completely.",
        "Attach the flexible, thread only corners of the flexible squares to each of the four full-length bamboo sticks.",
        "This creates a series of flexible diamonds that add dimension and prismatic depth to your Diwali lantern.",
        "Positioning the thread-only corners against the full-length bamboo sticks at the mark and upper bamboo edge already in place, use a length of heavy duty thread to attach the thread-only corner to the frame.",
        "It's perfectly fine for this to require a little squeezing and stretching of the angles.",
        "You actually do not want them to lay completely flat, or to stick out straight.",
        "Tie off thread and dot with glue.",
        "Let glue dry completely.",
        "Affix one flexible square at a time.",
        "Repeat with three remaining flexible squares.",
        "Tie each pair of floating corners together with heavy duty thread.",
        "By the end of this step, your frame will be complete.",
        "Let glue dry completely.",
        "Hang an electric bulb.",
        "Affix a nail or hook and feed the electric cord with bulb through it, and note the distance between the bulb and nail/hook.",
        "Attaching Decorative Paper to Your Diwali Lantern Attach decorated paper to center areas.",
        "Starting with the central areas is easiest, and you can use your larger sheets of decorated paper here.",
        "Beginning with frames of the central squares (the ones made by the flexible squares) apply a very thin layer of glue to bamboo sticks.",
        "Lay decorated paper over it.",
        "Gently tap down.",
        "Repeat for remaining central squares.",
        "Let glue dry completely.",
        "Trim edges of paper with sharp scissors or sharp blade.",
        "To hide uneven sides, you can also stick stickers, glitter or decorative tape on them.",
        "Attach decorated paper to upper triangles with a thin layer of glue.",
        "Tap down.",
        "Let glue dry completely.",
        "Trim edges of paper with sharp blade.",
        "Attach paper to lower triangles with a thin layer of glue.",
        "Tap down.",
        "Let glue dry completely.",
        "Trim edges of paper with sharp blade or scissor if you like.",
        "Wrap ribbon around the top legs of lantern.",
        "Wrapping the ribbon will give the lantern a finished look.",
        "Secure with a knot and trim ends.",
        "Feel free to decorate the lantern how you like using different style of ribbons or strips.",
        "Wrap ribbon around the bottom legs of the lantern.",
        "Wrapping the ribbon here also finishes the look and provides a horizontal support to attach a fringe of ribbons.",
        "Make fringe on all four sides.",
        "Attach ribbons to lower strands of ribbon wrap.",
        "If tying the ribbon, use a cow-hitch knot.",
        "Hanging and Lighting Your Diwali Lantern Use heavy duty thread to hang lantern from nail or hook.",
        "This is the same nail or hook you are using to hang the electric cord and light socket.",
        "Adjust length so that the light hangs in the center of the lantern.",
        "Light it up!",
        "Now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor, and think about the triumph of light over darkness symbolized by your lantern!",
        "Use color-changing lights if you have them.",
        "This can make your white paper lantern look splendid.",
        "Use ones that aren't very flashy but are elegant and classy."
