A silicone polymer spray, or an acrylic copolymer spray, should preserve your leather's appearance and shine. Grease-based or wax-based products are more protective, but not recommended for jackets due to their potential effect on color, longevity, shine, and smell. Check the label on your product to find out how long the water resistance lasts. Typically, the product needs to be re-applied once every several weeks or months. While this treatment will make the leather jacket resistant to water damage, it will not be fully waterproof, even if the treatment claims otherwise. Never immerse a leather jacket in water or place it in a washing machine."
