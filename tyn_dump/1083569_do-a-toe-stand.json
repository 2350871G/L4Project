Tennis shoes can work, but keep in mind that performing this move over and over will wear the material down and cause tearing. The best option would be a triple toe and heel build-up shoe. These shoes have triple the padding of normal shoes throughout and are specifically made to enhance balance and overall support. You can find these at specialty shoe stores. Tap shoes work great as well. Not only are the toes strong, the sound they make will give you a clue as to whether or not you\u2019re landing properly. Grab a pair of these from any dance studio or online tap retailer. Another option are tap boots. They look like high-top sneakers and offer great ankle support. Beginners should consider this option.
