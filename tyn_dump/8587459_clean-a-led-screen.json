The cloth will likely pick up most of the smudges on your screen, as it is able to pick up both dirt and oil. If it's not working, you may need to add water next. Scrub gently. If your screen is extra smudged, you may be tempted to really put some elbow grease into it. However, LED screens can be fairly sensitive, so don't press down hard. If you press too hard, you could end up with a cracked screen. Using paper towels or sponges you have around the house can damage the screen. A microfiber cloth is soft enough not to scratch the surface, but it is both able to hold water and capture oil, which are good qualities in a cleaning cloth. Plus, its fibers easily remove dirt. A soft, lint-free cloth will also work. Start with a clean cloth, as dirt in the cloth can scratch the surface. Make sure you don't use fabric softener on the cloths, though, as that can lead to a layer on the cloth that will inhibit cleaning."
