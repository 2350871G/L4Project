    "text": " Drawing a 5-Pointed Star Draw an upside down \"V.\" Begin at the lower left side of your drawing, come up to a point and bring your pencil down and to the right. Do not lift your pencil from the paper until you are finished. Draw a straight line at an upward angle to the left. Cross your first line about 1/3 of the way up \"\\\" without lifting your pencil from the paper. Draw a straight horizontal line across your drawing, ending at the right side. Cross the upside-down \"V\" shape about 1/3 of the way down: \"-\". Again, do not lift your pencil. Draw a straight line at a downward angle back to your starting point. Your line will connect with the lower left corner of your drawing: \"/\". Lift your pencil from the paper. Your star is complete. Erase the lines well if you don't want them to be visible in the center of the star.  Drawing a 6-Pointed Star Start by drawing a large circle using a compass. Place a pencil into the pencil holder on your compass. Then, place the point in the center of a piece of paper. Turn the top of the compass while keeping the point still. The pencil will draw a circle that is perfectly centered around the point. Make a dot at the top of your circle with the pencil. Then, move the point of your compass until it is on top of the dot. Do not change the radius of the compass as you are moving it. Turn your compass to make a pencil mark that crosses your circle on the left. Repeat this on the right side of the point that you drew. Move your point to one of the marks without changing the radius of the compass. Make another mark on the edge of the circle. Continue moving your compass point to the new marks and drawing marks until you have a total of 6 marks that are equidistant. Set your compass aside. Use a ruler to create a triangle that starts from the top mark on the edge of the circle. Place your pencil on the top mark. Skip the first mark to the left and connect the top mark to the second mark to the left. Draw a second mark straight across to the right, skipping the mark on the bottom. Finish by connecting that mark to the top mark. This will complete your first triangle. Create a second triangle starting with the mark at the base of your circle. Place your pencil on the bottom mark. Connect it with the second mark to the left by drawing a straight line. Draw a line straight across to your right, skipping the top mark. Finish the second triangle by drawing an additional line back to the bottom mark on the edge of the circle. Erase the circle. Your 6-point star is complete. Drawing a 7 Pointed Star (Type 1) Do the first two steps of the 5-point method. This type of star is similar to the 5-pointed star. Instead of going horizontally rightwards, draw a bit lower. Save a gap for another point. Draw horizontally leftwards.  Draw back to the gap you made in Step 2.  Finish the 7 pointed star by connecting it back to where you started.  Now you can sit back and impress your friends!  Drawing a 7 Pointed Star (Type 2) Draw an unfinished triangle. Leave a gap between the starting and ending points as follows. Draw a line from the last point to somewhere between the first and second point.  Continue like the previous step. Draw towards somewhere between the second and third point, then between the third and forth point. Connect to where you started. ",
