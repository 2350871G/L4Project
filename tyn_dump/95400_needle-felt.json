Some of your local crafting stores will have felting supplies, but you'll find more gear online. To begin your starter kit you'll need:\nOne or two felting needles\nWool fiber\nFoam cushion or pillow Prepare the wool. Tear a sheet of wool at least half an inch thicker than your planned shape. Make sure the wool is half an inch larger on each side of the template you've created. Lay the wool on the foam. You can use either a foam cushion or an old pillow. You will definitely get holes in the pillow if you go for this option, so be aware. Poke the needle into the wool at random. To begin make sure the wool is positioned firmly onto the surface of your choice. Poke the wool in an up and down motion at random. You don't need to be forceful. Be sure to watch your fingers in this action. Outline your shape into the middle of the wool. Using straight pins, outline the shape that you've chosen.

Advancing Your Shapes Pick out a 3D shape. The process for creating 3D shapes is very similar to creating flat shapes. Creating a ball is a great start to understanding the basics of 3D felting. Creating a ball can also be a very useful tool for storing your needles. Form a ball. Pinch a wad of fiber and coil it up into a ball using your fingers. You can start with a small wad at first. Compress and add more fiber. Use your felting needle to compress the wad of fibers into a smaller ball shape. Then add more fiber to the ball and repeat compressing it using your felting needle. Continue till you have the desired size. Be sure that the needle pokes go in and out of the ball at the same angle. You don't need to be hard with each poke, but instead focus on making straight lines. Use different colors of wool. Adding a variety of color will strengthen the aesthetic of your designs.
