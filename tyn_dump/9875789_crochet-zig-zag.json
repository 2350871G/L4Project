For a larger swatch or blanket, chain 34 or 51 stitches which are multiples of 17. Insert your hook into the fourth chain and make 1 double crochet stitch (dc). Wrap the yarn around your hook and insert it into the fourth chain from your hook. Continue to yarn over and pull through the loops on your hook to make a double crochet stitch. Dc the next 5 ch stitches and dc 1, ch 2, and dc 1 into the next stitch. Make 1 double crochet stitch in each of the 5 chain stitches across the foundation row. Then make 1 dc stitch, chain 2 stitches, and make 1 more dc into the next stitch. Dc into each of the next 7 chain stitches. Keep working across the row by making 1 double crochet stitch into the chain stitches. Finish the foundation row by double crocheting and skipping stitches. Skip the next 2 chain stitches and double crochet 1 into each of the next 7 chain stitches. Then dc 1, chain 2, and dc 1 into the next chain stitch. Dc 1 into each of the next 7 chain stitches. Keep repeating this pattern until you reach the end of the row. Turn the work, chain 3, and skip the first stitch. Flip the work over so you can begin crocheting your first real row in the zig zag pattern. Make 3 chain stitches and skip the stitch closest to your hook. Dc the next 2 stitches together (dc2tog) and dc 1 into the next 5 stitches. Decrease the number of stitches in this row by double crocheting 2 of them together. Then you'll need to double crochet 1 stitch into each of the following 5 stitches. Insert your hook and dc 1, chain 2, and dc1. Insert your hook into the next 2 chain space and make 1 double crochet stitch. Chain 2 into the same stitch and double crochet another 1 stitch into the same stitch. This will form the point of the zig zag. Dc into 7 stitches, skip 2 dc, and dc in the next 7 stitches. Make 1 dc stitch into each of the next 7 dc stitches. This will bring you across the other diagonal side of the zig zag. Then skip 2 double crochet stitches and dc 1 into the next 7 dc. Remember to double crochet into each of the 7 stitches across the row. Dc 1, chain 2, and dc 1 to make another zig zag point. Insert your hook into the next dc stitch and make 1 double crochet stitch. Chain 2 into the same stitch and double crochet 1 more stitch into the same stitch. Continue to crochet in zig zag pattern until you reach the last 8 stitches. To work the zig zag pattern, keep repeating:\nDc 1 into each of the next 7 dc stitches, skip the next 2 dc stitches, dc 1 into each of the next 7 dc stitches, and then dc 1, chain 2, and dc 1 into the next stitch. Dc 1 into the next 5 dc stitches and dc2tog the next 2 stitches. To finish the row, make 1 double crochet stitch into each of the next 5 dc stitches. Join together the next 2 stitches and dc 1. Turn the work to make another row, if desired. Crocheting Zig Zag Puff Stitches Make a foundation chain that's a multiple of 3 and add 3. Because the zig zag puff stitches are stretchy, make the foundation chain a little looser than normal. To make a sample swatch, try chaining up 15 stitches. For the sample, 12 is a multiple of 3. Add 3 to 12 to get 15. Dc into the fourth chain, skip 1 and dc 7 to 9 times into the stitch. Insert your hook into the fourth chain from your hook, skip 1 chain stitch and double crochet (dc) in the next stitch. Yarn over and insert the hook into the same stitch. Do this 7 to 9 more times and chain 1 to secure the puff. Make 7 loops if the yarn you're working with is bulky. If you're crocheting with a lighter yarn, make 8 or 9 loops. Make zig zag puffs across the first row and half-double crochet (hdc) 1. Once you've completed 1 zig zag puff, skip 1 chain stitch and double crochet again. Make another zig zag puff stitch and secure it by chaining 1. Keep doing this until you reach the end of the row and then make a half-double crochet stitch in the last chain. If you started with 15 chain stitches, you should have 6 zig zag puffs for your first row. Chain 2 stitches and turn the work. Make 2 chain stitches once you've finished the first row. Flip the work over so you can begin crocheting from right to left again. Skip 1 stitch and double crochet (dc) into the first puff stitch. Skip the first stitch on the second row and insert your crochet hook into the next stitch. Make 1 double crochet stitch and then make a zig zag puff stitch in the gap between the puff stitches. Remember to keep wrapping the yarn over and pulling up to make 7 to 9 loops on your hook. Make the same number of loops for the puff stitches as you did for the first row. Make zig zag puff stitches to the end of the row and hdc the last stitch. To work across the row, skip 1 double crochet stitch and double crochet in the next puff stitch. Make another puff stitch in the gap. When you get to the end of the row, remember to half-double-crochet and turn the work. Work the zig zag puff stitches across as many rows as you like.",
