Then, get some inexpensive wrapping paper or removable contact paper that matches your theme and cover the three side walls, the roof, and the inside of your locker door. Don't bother covering the bottom; it would get ruined too easily. Before you put the paper up, measure the length and width of the walls and the door. Then, use your measurements to pre-cut the sheets of paper so they fit perfectly. Contact paper has a sticky backing like the back of postage stamp and will stick right on the walls without tape. To put up wrapping paper, use scotch tape or magnets. Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not perfect. Once you fill your locker with supplies, no one will notice little wrinkles or tears because the paper just peeks through your other stuff with pops of color."
