Make sure that you have enough paint to complete the coverage needed with this shade of dark blue. Once you have mixed the perfect hue, it could be difficult to match this shade a second time.

If you accidentally mix too much black into the blue, have some extra blue paint on hand to even out the ratio. Combining Complimentary Colors Print out a color wheel. A color wheel presents the primary colors of red, yellow and blue, as well as all of the colors created by combining these primary colors to create others. There are basic color wheels which use only the primary and secondary colors. Consider using an advanced wheel which includes various tints, hues and shades. Find the exact placement on the color wheel of the specific hue of blue paint you are beginning with. In order to identify the complimentary color, you need to start with the exact placement of your blue paint on the color wheel. Don\u2019t  judge the hue based on the title of the paint. Rather, apply the paint to a small bit of white paper and allow it to dry. Compare this color to the color wheel and match the hue to the most accurate section of the wheel. Identify the shade of orange which is complimentary to your shade of blue. A complimentary color is the color directly across the wheel from the blue you have identified. This should be some version of orange and is the color you will mix with your blue to darken it. A good place to start would be mixing Burnt Sienna with Ultramarine Blue. Another possible color combination is Cadmium Orange and Cobalt Blue. Squeeze enough blue paint onto your palette to complete the coverage necessary with this shade of blue. It is better to have too much paint than too little in order to avoid having to mix more and attempt to match your shade a second time. It is a good idea to save some of your blue paint in case you add too much orange and need to adjust the shade by adding blue back into your mixture.

Continue adding small amounts of orange and assessing the outcome until you create your perfect shade of dark blue. If you accidentally mix too much orange into the blue, have some extra blue paint on hand to even out the ratio. Mixing Analogous Colors to Make a Color Combination Pour some blue and purple paint on your palette. Purple, or violet, is an analogous color to blue, found next to it on the color wheel. Make sure that you have enough paint to work with. You will want more blue paint as your base color, than your purple mixing color. Mix a small amount of purple paint into the original blue. You can use your brush or a palette knife to mix your paint. Add a small amount of purple at a time in order to control the color combination and create a violet-blue. Test your paint color. Many paints, including acrylics, will darken when they dry. Acrylics dry quickly, so you can easily test your paint color by painting a small amount on your canvas and allowing it to dry. This should take no longer than 15 minutes, and will allow you to see the ultimate color before you use this shade for your project.
