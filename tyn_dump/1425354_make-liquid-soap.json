Use a bar of moisturizing soap to make a liquid soap you can use as body wash.\nUse unscented soap if you want to add your own scent to create customized liquid soap."

Use the finest grater you have so that when it's time for the soap to melt, the process goes more quickly. You can cut the soap into chunks if that helps you grate it more easily. You should end up with about 1 cup (229 g) of soap flakes. If you have less, grate a second bar of soap. This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled if you want to make a lot of liquid soap.
