    "text": " Making Eggless Vanilla Cake Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Lightly grease the inside of a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) rectangular cake pan, then line it with two crisscrossing sheets of parchment paper. If you'd rather have a round pan, lightly grease the inside of an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) spring form pan instead.Leave a few inches/centimeters of parchment paper hanging over the edge of your rectangular pan. This will make it easier to remove. If you are doing a round pan, lining the bottom with an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) parchment paper circle would be a good idea. Sift together the dry ingredients, then add the sugar. Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, then add the baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk everything together, then stir in the sugar. For a lighter, fluffier cake, try cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. Whisk in the wet ingredients, one at a time. Make a large well in the center of the dry ingredients first. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk, water, white vinegar, vanilla extract, and melted butter, whisking well after each addition. Don't worry if there are a few lumps in the batter. For extra flavor, switch out the water for orange juice. Add some orange zest. Sweetened condensed milk may come in different-sized cans. A large (400-milliliter) can will give you a sweeter cake than a small (300-milliliter) can. Transfer the batter into the pan. Pour the batter into the pan. Use a rubber spatula to scrape out any leftover batter in the bowl. Gently tap the pan to help release any air bubbles. Bake the cake for 25 to 35 minutes. Place the pan into the center of the oven, and let it bake for 25 to 35 minutes. It is ready when a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool on a rack before removing it from the pan. Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven using oven mitts or a potholder. Set it down onto a wire cooling rack, and let it cool for 15 to 20 minutes before removing it from the pan. To remove a rectangular cake: lift it out by the over-hanging parchment paper. To remove a spring form cake: undo the clasp on the side of the pan, then lift away the side wall. Frost the cake as desired. Use a long knife to cut the cake in half. Prepare some buttercream frosting, then use an off-set cake decorating spatula to spread some of it across the bottom later of the cake. Place the second layer on top, then frost the top and sides of the cake. Add some sliced strawberries to the center of the cake for more flavor. Instead of a buttercream filling, you could try chocolate hazelnut spread, or strawberry/raspberry jam. If you don't like buttercream, try chocolate ganache instead! Making Eggless Chocolate Cake Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Lightly grease the inside of a 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) spring form cake pan. You can make the cake even easier to remove by lining the inside with a 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) circle cut from parchment paper. If you want to make a layered cake, double this recipe and make two 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) cakes. Mix together the sweetened condensed milk and the butter. Pour the condensed milk into a large mixing bowl, then add the butter. Mix the two together until they turn light and fluffy. You can do this with a whisk or an electric mixer. Sift together the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Sift the flour into a separate bowl. Add the cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk them together until the color is consistent. Fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture. Pour the flour mixture into the condensed milk mixture. Stir them together with a rubber spatula, scrapping the bottom and sides of the bowl often. Stir in the vinegar, vanilla extract, and milk. Start with about half the amount of milk you need, then add more as necessary. Keep stirring until the texture is sooth and drippy. Pour the batter into the cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to help scrape out any excess batter from the bowl and into the pan. Gently tap the sides of the pan to help release any air bubbles. Bake the cake in the center of the oven for 25 to 35 minutes. Check the cake for doneness after 25 minutes by poking a toothpick into the center. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done. If the toothpick has crumbs on it, bake the cake longer; check it every 5 minutes or so. Allow the cake to cool before taking it out of the pan. Use a potholder or an oven mitt to take the cake out of the oven. Set the cake down onto a wire cooling rack, and let it cool for about 15 to 25 minutes. Once the cake has completely cooled, take it out of the pan. Frost the cake as desired. Vanilla buttercream, chocolate buttercream, or chocolate ganache are all great choices here. If you make a layered cake, frost the top of your first cake with an off-set cake decorating spatula. Set the second cake on top, then finish frosting the top and sides of the stacked cakes. For a more flavorful cake, fill it with some raspberry jam instead. For a fancier cake, coat the top with chocolate ganache, then let it drop down the sides like icicles. Making Vegan Vanilla Cake Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease the inside of two 7-inch (17.78-centimeter) cake pans. To make the cakes easier to remove, consider lining each pan with a 7-inch (17.78-centimeter) circle of parchment paper. Mix together the dry ingredients. Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl first. Add the sugar, baking soda, and salt. Stir everything together with a whisk. Whisk in the wet ingredients. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the soy milk, vanilla extract, olive oil, and vinegar into the well. Stir everything together with a whisk until the color and texture are consistent. Distribute the batter evenly between both pans. Use a rubber spatula to scrape any leftover batter out of the bowl and into the pans. Gently tap the sides of each pan to help settle any air bubbles. Bake the cakes in the center of the oven for 30 minutes. The cakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. If the cakes are not ready by then, continue baking them at 5-minute intervals; check the cakes for doneness with the toothpick between each interval. Cool the cakes on a rack before removing them from the pans. Use oven mitts or a potholder to take the cakes out of the oven and transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Allow the cakes to cool off completely, then remove them from the pans. Run a knife along the inside of each pan first, then invert the pans to release the cake. Prepare the frosting. Mix the powdered sugar, vegan butter, vanilla extract, and non-dairy milk together using an electric mixer. Start off with a low speed, then work your way up to a high one. Keep mixing until the frosting is creamy and smooth. The frosting should be thin enough to spread, but thick enough to hold onto the spatula. If the frosting is too thin, add more powdered sugar; if it's too thick, add more milk. Frost the cakes. Set one of the cakes onto a plate, and spread some of the frosting on top with an off-set cake decorating spatula. Add the second cake on top, then finish coating the top and sides with the rest of your frosting. For a more flavorful cake, add some sliced strawberries inside the cake, and whole strawberries on top. If you are preparing the cake ahead of time, hold off on the strawberries until serving time, or the cake will get soggy. Making Vegan Chocolate Cake Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Lightly grease the inside of two 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) cake pans. Cut two 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) circles out of parchment paper, and place one inside of each cake pan. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Pour the all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir everything together with a whisk until the ingredients are distributed evenly throughout the flour. Whisk together the wet ingredients in a medium bowl. Pour your choice of non-dairy milk (such as soy) into a medium mixing bowl. Add the light cooking oil, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract. Stir everything together until evenly combined. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ones. Make a well in the center of the dry mixture first. Pour the wet mixture into the well, then stir everything together with a rubber spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl so that everything gets mixed in evenly. Be careful not to over-mix, however! Distribute the batter evenly between both cake pans. Scrape any leftover cake batter out of the bowl and into the pans with a rubber spatula so that you don't waste anything. Once you have the batter in, gently tap the sides of the pans to release any air bubbles. Bake the cakes in the middle of the oven for about 40 minutes. The cakes are ready when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean. If the toothpick comes out with crumbs on it, bake the cakes at 5-minute intervals until they are done; do the toothpick test between each interval. Allow the cakes to cool before removing them from the pans. Run a knife around the inside of each pan, then flip the pans upside down to remove the cakes. Peel the parchment paper off of each cake. Prepare the frosting. Use a stand mixer to mix together the vegan butter, vegetable shortening, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. Keep mixing until the frosting turns creamy and forms peaks. If the frosting is too stiff, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of non-dairy milk, then mix again. Fill and frost the cake. Place one of the cakes onto a place. Use an off-set cake decorating spatula to spread a generous amount of frosting on top. Place the second cake on top, and spread more frosting over the top. Finish off by spreading the remaining frosting down the sides of the stacked cakes. For a fancier cake, use a spatula to create swirly patterns in the frosting.",
