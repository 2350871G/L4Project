        "Tear off a generous chunk of beef to form the patties.",
        "Once you\u2019ve brought the ground beef home, you can form the individual patties.",
        "The size of the patties can be left up to personal preference, but in general a fist-sized chunk of beef will produce a good sized burger.",
        "Handle the meat gently.",
        "When you\u2019re tearing chunks of beef off of the slab you bought, do not handle and squeeze the meat too much.",
        "If you mash the beef while you\u2019re handling it, you\u2019ll wring some of the moisture out of the meat.",
        "Form burger patties with your hands.",
        "Use your hands to gently press each fist-sized chunk of ground beef into a relatively flat, disc-shaped patty.",
        "If you\u2019re working on a hard surface (a clean countertop or a plastic cutting board), you can press the patties against the surface to avoid squeezing them too hard with your hands.",
        "Shape your patties however you like.",
        "In general, the patties should be about 4 inches (10 cm) across and \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) high before cooking.",
        "Press a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) dimple into the center of each burger.",
        "Your burgers will cook quickly at the edges, and more slowly in the centers.",
        "To achieve a burger that is evenly cooked through, use your index and middle finger to press a dimple into the top of each burger.",
        "Aim to make the center of each patty about \u20448\u2013\u20444 inch (0.32\u20130.64 cm) lower than the edges of the patty.",
        "The dimple will also prevent your burgers from bulging up in the middle.",
        "Cooking Burgers on the Stovetop Set a flat frying pan on a burner at medium-high heat.",
        "Depending on the number of burgers you\u2019re planning to cook, you can use either a large or a small frying pan.",
        "On most ranges, medium-high heat will be about 7.",
        "Add the burgers once the pan is hot.",
        "The patties should each sizzle when they hit the hot surface of the pan.",
        "Give each burger at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space on either side in the skillet, so that none of the burgers fuse together as they cook.",
        "Flip the patties with a thin spatula after a 3-5 minutes.",
        "Once the burgers have cooked for a few minutes, slide a thin spatula under each burger and flip it over.",
        "As when molding the patties, the burgers will stay juicier if you handle them as little as possible while cooking.",
        "When flipped, each burger should have be seared to a dark golden-brown on the bottom side.Tips on flipping:Check the underside of the patty first.",
        "Slip your spatula under the patty after about 3 minutes and tip it upwards to get a glimpse of the underside.",
        "The patty should a nice golden-brown color.",
        "If it\u2019s still a little pink, give it another minute or so.Use a wide, thin spatula.",
        "This kind of spatula is easy to quickly slide under the burger.",
        "It also lets you flip without crumbling the crust and helps a loosely-made burger stay together a bit better as you flip.Don\u2019t press the burgers down with your spatula.",
        "This pushes the juice out of the meat, making for a dryer burger, and won\u2019t help the patty cook any faster.",
        "Cook the burgers for another 3-5 minutes on the second side.",
        "Cooking the burgers for 3-5 minutes on both sides should ensure that they\u2019re evenly cooked through.",
        "You\u2019ll know that the burger is done on the second side when it begins to sizzle.",
        "Look to see that the burger is a nice golden-brown color.",
        "Resist the urge to flip the burgers over 3 or 4 times.",
        "Once will be enough.",
        "Watch the side of the burgers to see how done they are.",
        "If you cut into a burger to see when it\u2019s done, you\u2019ll risk losing some of the juiciness you\u2019ve worked hard to preserve.",
        "Instead, take a close look at the sides of a burger.",
        "If there\u2019s a slight line of pink in the middle of the side, the burger is medium-rare.",
        "If the sides are all browned, the burger is medium.",
        "Serve the burgers when they\u2019re medium-rare or medium.",
        "As the burgers continue to cook, more juice will cook out of them.",
        "Ensure that you\u2019ll have a juicy, flavorful burger by serving the patty when it\u2019s medium-rare or medium.",
        "Set the burger on a bun, and garnish with tomato, lettuce, mustard, ketchup, and whatever else you choose.",
        "Grilling Juicy Burgers Pre-heat the grill before applying your burgers.",
        "Heat two separate regions of the grill: one to be a high-heat zone at about 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C).",
        "Set the other as a low-heat zone, about 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C).",
        "Let the grill pre-heat for 15 minutes before you apply the patties.",
        "Oil the grill as it pre-heats.",
        "While the grill is warming up, drizzle some olive oil onto a paper towel.",
        "Rub the paper towel along the surface of the grill to lubricate it.",
        "This will help your patties cook evenly and prevent them from sticking to the grill as they brown.",
        "Set your patties on the high-heat side of the grill for about 2 minutes.",
        "The intense heat of the grill will create a delicious browned crust on either side of the burger, which adds to the rich flavor of the meat.",
        "If you were to leave the burger over high heat, the temperature would dry out the interior of the burger and eventually overcook the whole patty.",
        "Flip the burgers after about 2 minutes.",
        "After the burgers have cooked for about 2 minutes on the high-heat side of the grill, use a spatula to flip them over.",
        "When flipping the burgers, keep them at a distance of about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from each other.",
        "If the burgers are too close together, they may cook unevenly or fuse together while cooking.",
        "Move the patties over to the low-heat side once they\u2019re browned on both sides.",
        "Once both sides of the burgers are evenly browned, use your spatula to gingerly lift the patties and move them to the low-heat side of the grill.",
        "Keep a close eye on the cooking burgers so that you can remove them from the grill when they\u2019re as done as you\u2019d like them to be.",
        "Cook the burgers for 3-4 minutes on the low-heat side.",
        "Here, their juicy insides will continue to cook without getting dried out or burnt.",
        "Use the full surface of the low-heat side of your grill to keep the burgers from touching one another.",
        "Flip the burgers at about the 2-minute mark.",
        "This will ensure that all of the patties are evenly cooked through on both sides.",
        "Remove the burgers when they\u2019re medium-rare to medium 130\u2013140 \u00b0F (54\u201360 \u00b0C).",
        "Evaluate how cooked the burgers are by paying attention to their size and firmness.",
        "Burgers will shrink and tighten up as they cook.",
        "A rare burger will still be juicy if lightly pressed with a spatula, and will be soft and slightly squishy.",
        "If you\u2019re using a meat thermometer, a rare burger will be about 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C) .",
        "A medium-well burger will be about 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) .",
        "If you cook your burger to a higher temperature, it will no longer be juicy."
