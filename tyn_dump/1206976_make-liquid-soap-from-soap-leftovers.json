Cook the soap over a low/warm setting for 2 to 3 hours, then add more water. Stir the soap occasionally while it is heating. Add 20 ounces (591.5 milliliters) of more hot, boiled water, and give it a stir. Let the soap warm for another 2 to 3 hours, then add the final 20 ounces (591.5 milliliters) of hot water. Add some essential oil, if desired. Plan on adding about 2% of the soap's total volume. Keep in mind that some types of essential oils, such as lavender, will cause the soap to become thicker.
