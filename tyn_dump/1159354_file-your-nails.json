Choose one with a high grit to get the smoothest finish, around 300-600 grit. Coarse grits, around 80-100 grit, should only be used with acrylic nails. If you use them with natural nails, they will tear up your nails. Avoid metal files as they can also tear up your natural nails.

Deciding what shape you want will depend on what your preference is and what kind of nails you have. Oval-shaped nails are a great shape for growing out and maintaining your nails. It\u2019s the most functional since your nails will be least likely to break off in this shape. Oval-shaped nails are symmetrically round at the tip. Square-shaped nails are a great statement and work well with people who have long nails. The square shape comes from filing the nail straight at the tip all the way across the nail. Almond-shaped nails are great for making your fingers look more slender. The shape mimics the curve at the base of your nail. Have short nails that can\u2019t be shaped? It\u2019s no big deal. Use what you\u2019ve got to work with and apply cuticle oil to them every night to help them grow for future shaping."
