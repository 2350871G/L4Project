Try to find a lightweight rod that\u2019s able to support baits that weigh \u204416 ounce (1.8 g) or less. Make sure the rod is somewhere between 5\u20137 feet (1.5\u20132.1 m) long so you can cast your line without getting it caught up in overhanging branches. You can buy spinning rods from your local sporting goods or outdoor specialty store. If you plan on fly fishing, pick a fly rod that\u2019s between 7 \u20442\u20139 feet (2.3\u20132.7 m) long. Fly fishing rods are categorized by weight classes that are different than standard ones, so get a rod labeled 4- or 6-weight, which is best for trout and fishing rivers."

Get a spinning reel that\u2019s meant for regular freshwater use and can hold around 100 yards (91 m) of line. Attach the reel to the rod at the top of the handle and tighten it securely. You can buy a spinning reel from an outdoor specialty or sporting goods store. If you\u2019re fly fishing, get a fly reel that holds at least 50 yards (46 m) of line."

Avoid using thicker or heavier lines since it may spook the trout and keep them from biting. If you\u2019re fly fishing, use 50 yards (46 m) of 8 lb (3.6 kg) dacron fly backing on the reel first. Then tie a 9\u201312 ft (2.7\u20133.7 m) tapered leader onto the end of the fly backing.

Pinch the end of the split shot to open the jaws on the other side. Place the split shot 18 inches (46 cm) from the end of your fishing line so it doesn\u2019t weigh the lure down to the river bed. You can buy split shots at sporting goods stores or online. If you need to remove the split shot, pinch the end again and simply pull it off the line. Don\u2019t add split shots to your line if you\u2019re fly fishing since the bait needs to stay on the water\u2019s surface."

If you want spinners, choose ones that weigh \u204416 ounce (1.8 g) and are silver or gold so they mimic the colors of trout\u2019s natural prey. If you want minnow imitations, look for lures that are 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) long that have silver or green colors. Make sure either lure you choose has size 8 hooks to catch the trout. You can attach your own bait hooks to lures if you can\u2019t find any in the right size. If you\u2019re fly fishing, choose baits that look similar to the insect species in the area where you\u2019re fishing. You may need to visit the area first or talk to local anglers to see what types of insects are abundant.Tip: If you\u2019re catching and releasing trout, opt for barbless hooks so they\u2019re easier to remove."

    "text": " Choosing a Rod and Lures Choose a spinning rod that\u2019s 5\u20137 ft (1.5\u20132.1 m) long. Spinning rods are designed to hold spinning reels and work best for casting lightweight lures accurately. Try to find a lightweight rod that\u2019s able to support baits that weigh \u204416 ounce (1.8 g) or less. Make sure the rod is somewhere between 5\u20137 feet (1.5\u20132.1 m) long so you can cast your line without getting it caught up in overhanging branches. You can buy spinning rods from your local sporting goods or outdoor specialty store. If you plan on fly fishing, pick a fly rod that\u2019s between 7 \u20442\u20139 feet (2.3\u20132.7 m) long. Fly fishing rods are categorized by weight classes that are different than standard ones, so get a rod labeled 4- or 6-weight, which is best for trout and fishing rivers. Use a medium spinning reel on your rod. A spinning reel keeps slack on the line so it\u2019s less likely to break, and it is very easy to cast. Get a spinning reel that\u2019s meant for regular freshwater use and can hold around 100 yards (91 m) of line. Attach the reel to the rod at the top of the handle and tighten it securely. You can buy a spinning reel from an outdoor specialty or sporting goods store. If you\u2019re fly fishing, get a fly reel that holds at least 50 yards (46 m) of line. Select a 4\u20138 lb (1.8\u20133.6 kg) fishing line for your reel. Trout usually only grow to 8 pounds (3.6 kg), so the line you use needs to support that much weight. Choose a clear monofilament line that\u2019s at least 50\u2013100 yards (46\u201391 m) long for your rod. Tie a knot around the reel\u2019s spool and slowly spin the handle to guide the line onto it. Avoid using thicker or heavier lines since it may spook the trout and keep them from biting. If you\u2019re fly fishing, use 50 yards (46 m) of 8 lb (3.6 kg) dacron fly backing on the reel first. Then tie a 9\u201312 ft (2.7\u20133.7 m) tapered leader onto the end of the fly backing. Finally, attach a 2\u20134 ft (61\u2013122 cm) 4X tippet, which is the thinnest gauge line that attaches to the fly. Put a split shot about 18 in (46 cm) from the end of the line. A split shot is a small weight attached to your line that keeps your lure underwater after you cast it. Pinch the end of the split shot to open the jaws on the other side. Place the split shot 18 inches (46 cm) from the end of your fishing line so it doesn\u2019t weigh the lure down to the river bed. You can buy split shots at sporting goods stores or online. If you need to remove the split shot, pinch the end again and simply pull it off the line. Don\u2019t add split shots to your line if you\u2019re fly fishing since the bait needs to stay on the water\u2019s surface. Try spinner or minnow imitation lures when you use artificial baits. Spinners work well on small- to medium-sized trout, while minnow imitations tend to catch larger fish. If you want spinners, choose ones that weigh \u204416 ounce (1.8 g) and are silver or gold so they mimic the colors of trout\u2019s natural prey. If you want minnow imitations, look for lures that are 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) long that have silver or green colors. Make sure either lure you choose has size 8 hooks to catch the trout. You can attach your own bait hooks to lures if you can\u2019t find any in the right size. If you\u2019re fly fishing, choose baits that look similar to the insect species in the area where you\u2019re fishing. You may need to visit the area first or talk to local anglers to see what types of insects are abundant.Tip: If you\u2019re catching and releasing trout, opt for barbless hooks so they\u2019re easier to remove. Put live worms or crickets on circular hooks if you want to use natural bait. If you\u2019re using worms, push the hook through it in at least 2 different places so it\u2019s less likely to fall off in the current. Try to conceal as much of the hook as you can since trout won\u2019t usually strike the bait if they see it. If you\u2019re using crickets, guide the hook through the solid parts of their bodies behind their front legs. Don\u2019t use any natural bait if you\u2019re fly fishing since it won\u2019t float on the surface or look like a native fly to the area. Some areas don\u2019t allow you to use natural baits, so check with your local fishing regulations before buying bait. Finding a Fishing Spot Try fishing in the spring or fall for the best chances at catching trout. Trout prefer living in cold, clear water, so they tend to gather in rivers before and after water temperatures rise. Wait until the middle of spring when it starts to get warmer since that\u2019s when trout tend to spawn. If you\u2019re fishing in the fall, wait until the hottest days have passed so you\u2019re more likely to find fish.

Try to keep the fish underwater as much as possible so you don\u2019t put more stress on it.Tip: If you aren\u2019t able to get the hook out, cut as much of the line or hook as you can with a pair of snips. The hook will rust or break away on its own. Clean the trout immediately if you plan on keeping it. Push the blade of a knife directly behind the fish\u2019s eye to stun it so it doesn\u2019t struggle while you clean it. Slice its belly from the tail up to the gills. Make a cut through the trout\u2019s lower jaw and put your finger inside. Pull down toward the tail to get rid of the internal organs. Scrap the dark blood line along the fish\u2019s spine with your thumb. It\u2019s illegal in many areas to keep trout alive after you catch them since they require a high amount of oxygen that you cannot provide in a bucket or livewell. If you aren\u2019t able to clean the fish right away, push your knife blade behind the trout\u2019s eye to dispatch it. Keep the fish you catch in a container with ice or a creel, which is a basket used for holding fish.",

        "Try spinner or minnow imitation lures when you use artificial baits.",
        "Spinners work well on small- to medium-sized trout, while minnow imitations tend to catch larger fish.",
        "If you want spinners, choose ones that weigh \u204416 ounce (1.8 g) and are silver or gold so they mimic the colors of trout\u2019s natural prey.",
        "If you want minnow imitations, look for lures that are 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) long that have silver or green colors.",
