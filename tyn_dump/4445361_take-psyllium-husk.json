                    "description": "Psyllium husk is a source of soluble fiber. It is often used for occasional constipation and to help restore regularity. Psyllium husk works by absorbing water in your digestive tract and combining with the water to form bulky stool. This process stimulates digestion and helps quicken the passage of stool. For this reason, psyllium husk is known as a bulk forming laxative. Psyllium husk is also used to help treat irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. These conditions cause pain and digestive problems that may be alleviated by incorporating psyllium husk into your daily routine."

                    "description": "Your doctor may advise against taking psyllium husk products if you are on any medications. Psyllium can reduce the absorption of medications into the digestive system. If your doctor says it's okay to take psyllium husk with your medications, he or she may recommend that you take psyllium husk at least 2 hours before or after you have taken your other medications. This time between taking psyllium husk and your medications will reduce the likelihood that the psyllium will affect your medication absorption."

Pure psyllium husk powder has a sawdust-like texture that some people find unpleasant, so it is also available in forms that are flavored and easily dissolvable. The advantage of these products is that they have a more pleasant taste and texture than pure psyllium husk. Psyllium products like Metamucil are known as blond psyllium and they often contain sugar and other additives. You can purchase flavored Metamucil powder to mix with water or you can even get cookies or wafers that contain psyllium husk. Follow the instructions on the package when taking one of these forms of psyllium husk. If you prefer, purchase a 100% psyllium husk powder product at a health food or nutrition store. This type of psyllium husk has no flavor or added sugar, so it is best to mix it with water or juice."
