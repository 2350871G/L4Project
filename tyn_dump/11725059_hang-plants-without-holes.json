Then, slide the hook or twine on your pot over the loop of the adjustable hook to hang it up.Tip: This is the best option if you want to hang the plant directly from the ceiling. However, be sure to check the weight limitation for your command hooks before buying them. Typically, command hooks can hold 5\u201310 pounds (2.3\u20134.5 kg), so you have to get stronger hooks for heavier plants. You can also do this with standard command hooks if you want to hang them from a portion of trim or wall that doesn\u2019t have any drywall underneath it."
