While that may be true on a superficial level, if you bottle up your feelings inside, you won\u2019t be able to truly move forward. Instead, slow down, get some time to yourself, and let yourself cry, be angry, let it all out. Just to get in touch with your feelings in the best way that you can. Simply taking some time alone to cry can help you feel better and get on the road to healing. Crying is perfectly okay. It is normal and healthy and can help you express your emotions without hurting others or doing something you'll regret. For most people, crying is essential/natural. Many people find, however, that after a few days or so, it helps to continue work/school. It assists you to take your mind off of the loss and can help you rationalize the problem. That said, not everyone cries after the death of a loved one. If you\u2019re not crying, this doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t care about the person who passed away; it just means that you\u2019re dealing with the situation differently. Don\u2019t feel guilty for not crying or force yourself to do something you don\u2019t want to do or don\u2019t feel ready for. You can let your feelings out when you\u2019re alone in your room, or even by talking to a loved one about what you\u2019re going through. You can decide what would help you the most and be the best for everyone. Writing in a journal during a time of sadness can also help you deal with the emotions."

Try to subtly and kindly let these people know how they could be more helpful or gently steer them in the right direction, or just try to politely spend as little time with them as possible if they\u2019re really bothering you. People may do things like compare your loss of your closest relative to the loss of a casual acquaintance or distant cousin; they may say, \u201cHe\u2019s in a better place\u201d, or they may even say that it took them \u201ca few weeks\u201d to get back into the swing of things after so-and-so died.

It can be exhausting to put up a cheerful front if you\u2019re not feeling your best. Exerting this kind of energy in a false way can actually make you feel much worse. Feel free to not burst out crying in the middle of a class or meeting, but also feel free to talk to people about your pain, let them know your feeling bad.

Eat three healthy, balanced meals a day that include protein-rich meats, organic fruits, vegetables, and healthy carbs. Pay attention to your hygiene. It\u2019s important to shower, bathe, and groom yourself regularly so you feel more ready to face the world. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day if you can.

You don\u2019t have to fill your social calendar with a million different events unless you feel it helps you. In fact, it\u2019s important to continue to make time for decompressing and reflecting on your own. If you\u2019re normally a social drinker, you should avoid alcohol until you feel more emotionally stable. Alcohol is a depressant, and while it may numb the pain at first, it can actually lead you to feel more sad and unstable.

Set aside at least a few hours each week to do the things you love and let yourself get immersed in them. Though you can\u2019t distract yourself away from your pain forever, devoting yourself to something you care about can help you heal faster than doing something that numbs your mind, such as watching reality TV. Of course, though, there\u2019s room for both, and if you\u2019re not up to doing something you care about yet, be patient with yourself and progress on the road to healing at your own pace.

Don\u2019t force yourself to feel \u201cfine\u201d by a certain date or you\u2019re just liable to get frustrated and to feel disappointed in yourself for not following through. This is the time to be generous, not strict with yourself. Don\u2019t tell yourself that you have to act a certain way by a certain time and focus on healing from within instead. Don\u2019t compare yourself to how other people have dealt with loss. Your best friend or cousin might have put on a sunny exterior after a loss after a short amount of time, but you don\u2019t know what they were going through on the inside, and you are different than them. You are your own special person, who will deal with things your own way. Seeking Support Spend more time with your loved ones if you can. In your time of need, your friends and family members can give you the support you\u2019re looking for. Whether you\u2019re a movie date with your family or telling your best friend about all of the sadness you\u2019re feeling, making sure to connect with your loved ones can help you move forward with your life. You can\u2019t stay trapped inside your own head forever or you won\u2019t be able to start enjoying your relationships again.If you lost a family member, then spending time with other members of your family and sharing your memories of the person you lost can help you feel less alone. Remember that you don\u2019t have to avoid talking about the person you lost to move forward. It actually helps the grieving process to think and talk about the one who is gone. When you spend time with your friends, you don\u2019t need to go out to bars or big, loud, parties; just grabbing coffee with a close friend, going for a walk, or watching a lighthearted movie with someone you love can help you on the path to healing. Consider going to a support group. Being in a session with multiple people who are dealing with similar experiences can make you feel less alone and can help you find new ways to cope. It can also open you up to new relationships and can help you feel supported in your struggle to move forward. Having a support group to go to at least once or twice a week can give you something to look forward to and will make you feel like you have a new support system.Tell yourself you\u2019ll at least give it a chance. Don\u2019t judge what a support group is until you\u2019ve met the people there and have heard their stories. You may find that you feel even more comfortable sharing your story with new people who are going through the same thing. Find can find comfort in your Faith. If you do believe in a religion, then you can help yourself go on living by spending more time in your faith-based community. Whether you spend more time at your church, synagogue, mosque, or another religious establishment, you\u2019ll be able to not only find comfort in your faith but to spend more time in a community of like-minded people who truly care for one another. Even going to your religious establishment just once a week can give you something positive to look forward to and help you with your routine. Your faith-based community may also alert you to more events, such as volunteering opportunities, which can help you spend your time in a productive way. Consider therapy. Though therapy isn\u2019t for everyone, you shouldn\u2019t rule it out before you give it a chance. If you feel that you\u2019re having trouble coping on your own or even with help from friends and family, then your best bet may be to get the help of a knowledgeable professional who can talk with you about your feelings and mental state and can recommend the best course of action. Therapy or grief counseling can help you get a new perspective on your situation and to find new ways to get help. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re admitting weakness by seeking therapy or any other kind of help. In fact, quite the opposite is true; you\u2019re showing strength by being comfortable saying that you need help. Consider getting a pet. Though you may think it\u2019s silly to get a little cat or a dog during a time of great loss, it can actually improve your mental state quite a bit. Having a beloved pet can give you someone to cuddle and spend time with as well as someone who needs you to take care of him; this can give you a sense of meaning and purpose. Of course, getting a kitten won\u2019t bring your beloved lost one back, but it can give you something to live for and provide some healthy distraction. Go to an animal shelter to bring home a rescue animal. You\u2019ll feel even better for bringing home an animal who really needs your love and care. Don\u2019t get discouraged by people who don\u2019t know how to help. Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to make you feel better, and some people may even unintentionally make you feel worse. People may say things they don\u2019t really mean because they think it\u2019ll make you feel better or because they think it\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to say, or they may speak a few well-meant things that don't actually help. Try to subtly and kindly let these people know how they could be more helpful or gently steer them in the right direction, or just try to politely spend as little time with them as possible if they\u2019re really bothering you. People may do things like compare your loss of your closest relative to the loss of a casual acquaintance or distant cousin; they may say, \u201cHe\u2019s in a better place\u201d, or they may even say that it took them \u201ca few weeks\u201d to get back into the swing of things after so-and-so died. People may not mean to be hurtful and just want you to feel better, even if they have a poor way of expressing it. Try to understand that it's the thought that counts. Remember that, if you\u2019re spending too much energy being frustrated with people who don\u2019t know how to help, it may just be that you\u2019re taking all of your negative energy or sadness out on the wrong situation. It\u2019s natural that you\u2019re feeling frustrated, but make sure you don\u2019t take those feelings out on the wrong people; it\u2019s just not worth it. Don\u2019t force yourself to fake being happy and fake smile, etc. As you continue to move forward and to spend time with people out in the world, don\u2019t try to make yourself be cheerful, extra friendly, and super peppy if you feel like crying on the inside. While you may want to hold off on showing the extent of your sad feelings in public, you certainly shouldn\u2019t try to hide the fact that you\u2019re going through a difficult time. If you try to convince your friends and family members that you\u2019re \u201cjust fine,\u201d then it\u2019s likely that they will be able to tell that you\u2019re bluffing pretty fast, or at the very least, not know you need help or think you don't want it and leave you to deal with things by yourself. It can be exhausting to put up a cheerful front if you\u2019re not feeling your best. Exerting this kind of energy in a false way can actually make you feel much worse. Feel free to not burst out crying in the middle of a class or meeting, but also feel free to talk to people about your pain, let them know your feeling bad. You don't have to pretend to be happy in your time of grieving. Moving Forward Avoid making big life decisions right away. You may feel like the death of your loved one has made you realize that you need to quit your job, sell your house, or move immediately, but you should take some time to think before you make any big decisions. You don\u2019t want to make a decision and then have to deal with regretting it while also coping with your grief. Instead, make sure you give it at least a few months, think about it with a clear head, and talk it through with some friends to make sure it\u2019s really the best choice.Though you may think that making a big decision or getting rid of what you see as unnecessary baggage in your life can make your burden lighter, chances are that the decision will give you more to deal with during a difficult time. Continue taking care of yourself. Though getting 8 hours of sleep or eating cruciferous vegetables may be the furthest thing from your mind when you\u2019re coping with grief, if you want to be able to go on living, then you have to remember to take care of yourself. Staying as healthy as you can will make you feel more physically and mentally tough and can make you more capable of dealing with the challenges life has thrown at you. Here are some things you should make sure to do:Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep and try to go to bed and wake up around the same time. Eat three healthy, balanced meals a day that include protein-rich meats, organic fruits, vegetables, and healthy carbs. Pay attention to your hygiene. It\u2019s important to shower, bathe, and groom yourself regularly so you feel more ready to face the world. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day if you can. Even going for a walk instead of driving can help you get your adrenaline pumping and can make you feel more mentally and physically sound. Slowly work on becoming more social again if you have withdrawn. As you start feeling like you\u2019re moving forward, you can let yourself get out of your comfort zone a bit more. Instead of just spending time watching TV with your friend, venture out to a restaurant with a few people, or even go to a small party if you\u2019re feeling up to it. Though you don\u2019t need to force yourself to go out there before you\u2019re ready, once you\u2019re feeling antsy by yourself, it can help you to spend more time connecting with others. You don\u2019t have to fill your social calendar with a million different events unless you feel it helps you. In fact, it\u2019s important to continue to make time for decompressing and reflecting on your own. If you\u2019re normally a social drinker, you should avoid alcohol until you feel more emotionally stable. Alcohol is a depressant, and while it may numb the pain at first, it can actually lead you to feel more sad and unstable. Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into drinking (or anything else, for that matter) if you\u2019re not ready for it, either. Pursue your hobbies and interests. Once you begin to gather your strength, you can go back to doing the things you love and the things that make you happy. Though you may not feel like watercolor painting, doing yoga, or playing guitar, at first, you\u2019ll probably find yourself missing out on your favorite activities little by little. Set aside at least a few hours each week to do the things you love and let yourself get immersed in them. Though you can\u2019t distract yourself away from your pain forever, devoting yourself to something you care about can help you heal faster than doing something that numbs your mind, such as watching reality TV. Of course, though, there\u2019s room for both, and if you\u2019re not up to doing something you care about yet, be patient with yourself and progress on the road to healing at your own pace. If you feel like you don\u2019t have anything that you really care about, you can think about finding a new passion and throwing yourself into that (like getting a pet from the shelter or making a quilt). Continue to pay tribute to the person\u2019s memory. Just because you\u2019re getting back into the swing of things, it doesn\u2019t mean that you should completely forget about the person you lost. You can still honor the person\u2019s memory by talking about that person with loved ones who cared about them, visiting their grave, look over photos or prized possessions that remind you of them, or just take some contemplative walks, thinking about that person. This can help you come to terms with the fact that the person is gone, while also keeping the person\u2019s love alive in your memory.If it\u2019s too painful for you to think or talk about your loved one right now, then you can wait until you feel more comfortable. Find the joy in life again. This step may seem like it\u2019s the hardest to achieve, but you will be able to do it, especially with support from other loved ones. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to \u201cfind closure\u201d or stop thinking about the lost person in order to find the joy and happiness in your life again. Once you feel like you\u2019re on the path to healing (or even before), you can begin to appreciate anything from a beautiful sunset to an afternoon spent with a good friend. You may feel like it\u2019s impossible to do this from where you\u2019re standing, but one day, you\u2019ll be able to go on living your life normally. If you take the time to appreciate the little things, from the loving touch of your kitty rubbing against your shin to an amazing home-cooked meal, you\u2019ll be moving toward not only living your life again but to living it to the fullest. Be patient with yourself. Things may seem drab, dark, and hopeless for a long time. But as long as you make the effort to move forward and take care of yourself, you will be able to feel joy again.",

        "Though you don\u2019t need to force yourself to go out there before you\u2019re ready, once you\u2019re feeling antsy by yourself, it can help you to spend more time connecting with others.",
        "You don\u2019t have to fill your social calendar with a million different events unless you feel it helps you.",

        "If you\u2019re normally a social drinker, you should avoid alcohol until you feel more emotionally stable.",

        "Set aside at least a few hours each week to do the things you love and let yourself get immersed in them.",
        "Though you can\u2019t distract yourself away from your pain forever, devoting yourself to something you care about can help you heal faster than doing something that numbs your mind, such as watching reality TV.",
        "Of course, though, there\u2019s room for both, and if you\u2019re not up to doing something you care about yet, be patient with yourself and progress on the road to healing at your own pace.",
        "If you feel like you don\u2019t have anything that you really care about, you can think about finding a new passion and throwing yourself into that (like getting a pet from the shelter or making a quilt).",
        "Continue to pay tribute to the person\u2019s memory.",
        "Just because you\u2019re getting back into the swing of things, it doesn\u2019t mean that you should completely forget about the person you lost.",

        "This can help you come to terms with the fact that the person is gone, while also keeping the person\u2019s love alive in your memory.If it\u2019s too painful for you to think or talk about your loved one right now, then you can wait until you feel more comfortable.",

        "This doesn\u2019t mean you have to \u201cfind closure\u201d or stop thinking about the lost person in order to find the joy and happiness in your life again.",
        "Once you feel like you\u2019re on the path to healing (or even before), you can begin to appreciate anything from a beautiful sunset to an afternoon spent with a good friend.",
        "You may feel like it\u2019s impossible to do this from where you\u2019re standing, but one day, you\u2019ll be able to go on living your life normally.",
        "If you take the time to appreciate the little things, from the loving touch of your kitty rubbing against your shin to an amazing home-cooked meal, you\u2019ll be moving toward not only living your life again but to living it to the fullest.",
        "Be patient with yourself.",
        "Things may seem drab, dark, and hopeless for a long time.",
        "But as long as you make the effort to move forward and take care of yourself, you will be able to feel joy again."
