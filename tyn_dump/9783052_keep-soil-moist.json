Spread handfuls of the material over the surface of the soil, then use a till or a pitchfork and mix the compost with your existing soil. Organic compost is most useful in yards or garden beds, rather than potted plants. Conventional organic compost will have a pH level of around 7 and contains nutrients that will strengthen your soil. Compost is a great way to get rid of organic waste in a natural way and will add needed nutrients to your soil as well."
