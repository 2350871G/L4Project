                    "description": "Before applying makeup, gently clean your face with a mild facial cleanser and lukewarm water to wash away dirt, oils, and other contaminants that could irritate your skin and cause inflammation. Massage the cleanser into your skin with your fingertips, since using a cloth or sponge could irritate your skin. Rinse away all the cleanser and pat your face dry with a clean towel.Tip: If your face tends to have rough or flaky patches of skin, use salicylic or glycolic acid cleanser 3 times a week in place of your regular cleanser. This will help gently exfoliate your skin and give it a more youthful appearance. Avoid cleansers that contain harsh, drying ingredients such as perfumes, alcohol, or parabens. Since your skin tends to dry out with age, opt for a moisturizing cleanser that contains ingredients like shea butter or glycerin. This will help hydrate your skin and minimize fine lines, wrinkles, and dry patches."

Define your lips with a natural-looking liner. Apply a liner in a shade close to your natural lips or your lipstick. This will help your lips look fuller and more clearly defined.For even fuller-looking lips, extend the liner slightly beyond the natural borders of your lips where they peak at the top, and also at the middle of your lower lip. Don\u2019t go outside the border around the rest of your lips, or they\u2019ll look unnatural and overdone. Choose a hydrating lipstick to avoid drying. Select a moisturizing formula rather than a matte lip color or an extended-wear shade that will dry out your lips. Moisturizing lipstick will go on more evenly and make your lips look fuller and more youthful.Sheer, buildable lipsticks can give your lips a healthy, natural-looking sheen along with a wash of color. They also tend to be less drying than matte lipsticks. Avoid long-lasting matte liquid formulas, which can be extremely harsh and drying on your lips. Avoid pale shades that wash out your lips. Lipsticks that are too pale will blur your lip line and make your lips appear older. A pale lip can also make you look ill or tired. Opt for lipsticks that are at least as dark as the darkest part of your lip.Don\u2019t be afraid to go for a bold lip color! Bright reds, deep berries, and lush pinks and corals can all look fabulous on mature women. Put on the lipstick with your finger or a lip brush. Applying your lipstick directly from the bullet makes it harder to achieve a precise, well-defined finish. Use a small brush or your finger to carefully apply the lipstick within the borders of your lip liner.To make your lipstick last longer, build it up with a brush and then use a tissue to blot your lips. If you like, add 1-2 more coats, focusing on the center of your lips.",
