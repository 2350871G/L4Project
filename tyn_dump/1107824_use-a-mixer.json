The main volume control and faders usually have a different color than the other controls so you can easily tell them apart. Plug microphones into channels using XLR cables. XLR cables are used to plug microphones in, and the ends have 3 pins inside a metal cylinder. Your mixer will either have XLR ports along the top edge or on the back side of the mixer. Plug the end of the XLR cable into the microphone you\u2019re using.

        "Change the treble, mid, and bass to adjust which frequencies come through.",
        "Each channel on your mixer has a column of knobs that control the treble, mid, and bass levels for your channel.",
        "The treble knob controls the high frequencies, the bass knob adjusts the lowest frequencies, and the mid knob changes everything in between.",
        "Listen to the audio input on the channel as you adjust the knobs to see how it changes the sound.",
        "If the channel has a microphone attached to it, lower the bass and raise the treble to make it sound more prominent.",
        "If the channel has an instrument, try adjusting each of the knobs and playing the instrument to see how it affects the sound.",
        "There are no perfect levels for your mix since it depends on the audio sources and the sound you\u2019re looking for.Tip: Some mixers have a button labeled \u201cLo Cut\u201d which will eliminate all frequencies on a channel below a certain decibel level.",
        "Use the \u201cLo Cut\u201d button on microphones and vocals to help cut unwanted low sounds.",
        "Use the gain knobs to continue increasing the volume of specific channels.",
        "The gain knobs are usually located at the top of each channel and are labeled \u201cGain.\u201d Slowly adjust the gain knob for the channel that you want to boost the audio for and test it compared to the rest of the instruments to see if you can clearly hear it.",
        "You don\u2019t need to raise the gain for every input you\u2019re using.",
        "If you do, all of the audio sources will sound muffled.",
        "Adjust the pan knobs to put the channel\u2019s audio in the left or right speaker.",
        "The pan knobs control the balance between the left and right speakers, and they are usually located directly above the channel faders.",
        "When the knob points down the middle, the audio will play equally through the left and right speakers.",
        "Turn the knob left if you want the audio to be more prominent from the left side, or set it right if you want to hear it more on the right side.",
        "Continue adjusting the pan for each channel.",
        "If you leave all of your audio sources panned in the middle, then the mix may sound flat.",
        "You can turn the knob slightly away from the middle if you want the input to come through both speakers but be more prominent in one of them.",
        "Isolating and Sending Channels Press the \u201cMute\u201d button on a channel to turn off its audio.",
        "Look near the channel fader for a small button labeled \u201cMute.\u201d When you click the button, the audio from all the other channels will continue going through the mixer while the selected channel will be quiet.",
        "When you want the audio to go through your mixer again, press the \u201cMute\u201d button to start the audio.",
        "Pressing the audio won\u2019t make the original input source stop working, but you won\u2019t be able to hear it through the speakers or headphones attached to the mixer.",
        "You can mute multiple tracks at the same time if you want to.",
        "Click the \u201cSolo\u201d button on a channel to isolate it.",
        "Look next to the \u201cMute\u201d button for another that\u2019s labeled \u201cSolo.\u201d When you press the solo button, every other channel will mute so you can only hear the channel you selected.",
        "When you want to start the other inputs, press the \u201cSolo\u201d button a second time to turn it off.",
        "Soloing a channel on a mixer allows you to easily make adjustments to specific instruments or vocals without lowering the faders on the other channels.",
        "You can solo multiple channels at the same time.",
        "Use an auxiliary channel to \u201csend\u201d an audio signal to another source.",
        "Auxiliary channels work well when you need to send copies of audio to specific monitors or put effects on them.",
        "Plug the monitor or effects rig into one of the ports on your mixer labeled \u201cAUX\u201d to start using the labeled auxiliary port.",
        "Turn the knob labeled \u201cAUX\u201d on the channel you want to send to adjust the volume level of the input.",
        "Make sure you\u2019re using the auxiliary knob that matches the auxiliary channel you\u2019re plugged into.",
        "You can send multiple channels to an auxiliary channel.",
        "For example, you may use an auxiliary channel if you\u2019re a singer and want to hear the drums and guitars in a monitor so you stay on beat."
