This will give you a thick, creamy base for your ice cream. If you don't have an electric mixer, you can use a food processor fitted with whisks. Stir together the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Make sure that the bowl is large enough to hold the beaten heavy cream as well. Fold the beaten cream into the condensed milk mixture using a spatula. Keep folding and stirring until it is evenly combined. Consider adding some goodies. Gently fold in your desired additions or flavorings with a spatula. Be careful not to over-mix, or your ice cream will lose its fluffiness. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nTo make mint-chip ice cream, add a few drops of peppermint extract and a handful of mini chocolate chips. To make S'mores ice cream, add some mini marshmallows, crumbled graham crackers, and some chocolate chunks.
