Stop using it when you start to see signs of discoloration on the metal or other signs of wear (like breakage). Make sure to clean the ring with soap and water or rubbing alcohol before each use. Crafting a Lip Ring Remove the bar from a cartilage hoop earring. It is possible to keep the bar on, but this will be very uncomfortable when it comes time to put the ring on your lip. So, use a pair of wire cutters to remove the bar. Make sure that you snap off the bar all the way. File down the rough metal edges. The newly exposed metal will be rough and uncomfortable. Use a file or sandpaper to make the metal smooth. Run your finger over the metal when you\u2019re done to make sure it is completely smooth. Wash the earring thoroughly.

A good choice is to use a stud that has a bar with two balls on either end because the material is sturdy. You can also use a short piece of thick metal wire. If you don\u2019t have a metal wire you can straighten a piece of a paper clip and cut off a portion of it. Bend the metal into a hoop with a pair of pliers. Use a pair of pliers to gently bend the ring. Take your time as you do this or you may break the stud. Patiently bend the ring until you have a hoop.

One side of the loop should be above the eyebrow and the other end below the eyebrow. Hold the ring in place for a moment as you wait for the glue to dry. You can reuse the ring until you start to see signs of wear, such as discoloration or breakage. Wash the ring before each use. Apply a 3-D sticker around your eyebrow. If you don\u2019t want a hoop, you can use 3-D sticker as \u201cstuds.\u201d Use two 3-D stickers in the color of your choice. Apply one sticker just above the middle to end of your eyebrows.
