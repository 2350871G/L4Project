If you have a hard time threading the needle, insert the tip of the thread into your mouth and wet it with your saliva.

This stitch creates a pyramid like stitch design. It allows good coverage of the canvas with the least distortion and should be used in large areas. Do the brick stitch for a vertical stitch with good coverage. Insert your needle through the canvas where you want to begin the stitch. Bring the thread all the way through the canvas and pull it taut. Then, insert the needle into the second stitch up from where you brought the needle out. Bring the needle back through the canvas next to where you started the first stitch. Use a thick thread, yarn, or multi-strand piece of embroidery floss to create the brick stitch. You can also try the Bargello or long point stitch for a more advanced vertical stitch. Completing a Project Work on the smallest or most detailed area first. Always start with the smallest, most detailed areas when you do needlework projects. This will be easier than trying to go in and stitch those areas later. Then, stitch the larger areas that surround the more detailed bits. For example, if you have a section that is only about 1 in (2.5 cm) wide, start here rather than the section that is 4 in (10 cm) wide. Change the thread when you run out or need to switch colors.
