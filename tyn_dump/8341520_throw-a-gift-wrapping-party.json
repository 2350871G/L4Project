        "You may want to mute the sound on your TV or turn the volume down low so you can chat with your friends while you wrap.",
        "Some ideas for this include:\nSeasonally suitable movies, like \u2018\u2019It\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u2019\u2019 at Christmas time, \u2018\u2019Father of the Bride\u2019\u2019 for bridal showers and wedding events, or \u2018\u2019Hocus Pocus\u2019\u2019 during Halloween.",

        "At the end of the party, you could choose the best wrapped gift and award the prize yourself, or you could have all your guests vote to determine who gets the prize.",
        "Some prize ideas you may want to consider:\nA gift certificate for two to the movies.",
        "This way the winner can bring a significant other, but if they\u2019re not seeing anyone, they can bring a friend instead.",

        "Who can wrap a present the fastest and nicest.",
        "Who can wrap a present best blindfolded.",
        "Disguise easy to recognize presents.",
        "Many people try to hide irregularly shaped gifts in boxes or gift bags.",
        "These work very well, but you can also disguise these objects with a little creativity.",
        "To ensure your gift remains a mystery, you might want to try such disguises like:\nA potted plant for lone gold clubs.",
        "You can decorate the club head as the base of a pot, then dress up the club handle like a flower, or you could transform the club head into the center of a bloom, with the handle as a stem.",
        "An ornament for a toy ball.",
        "Set the ball in a large piece of tissue paper, gather the paper around the top of the ball, and tie together the gathered paper with ribbon.",
