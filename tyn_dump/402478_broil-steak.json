    "text": " Prepping and Searing the Steak Choose a tender cut of steak. Some steaks will broil better than others, so you should take care when choosing cuts of meat. For broiling, choose a tender cut of steak like a sirloin, porterhouse, ribeye, top loin, eye round, or T-bone. Let the steak come to room temperature. You can use any kind of steak you want, from flank steak to top sirloin. Just be sure that the steak is between 1\u20131.75 inches (2.5\u20134.4 cm) thick.

Sticking cold steak in the oven may cause it to cook unevenly, so it's important to let it warm up a bit. If the steak is frozen, completely thaw it in the fridge, which may take up to 12 hours. Avoid thawing meat on the counter which could cause harmful bacteria to grow. Once it's thawed, remove it from the fridge and allow it to warm up to room temperature. Place a cast iron skillet in the oven and turn on the broiler. While the steak is coming up to room temperature, you can preheat your skillet and oven. Set the oven dial to \u201cBroil.\u201d  Make sure the rack you're using is about 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) from the heating element (use oven mitts to move it if necessary). Then, place the cast iron skillet on top of the rack and allow it to heat for 5-10 minutes. If your steak has both high and low broiler options, opt for high.

The very high temperatures involved in this cooking process can damage the non-stick coating and cause harmful particles from the coating to end up in your food. Season or marinate the steak as desired. Less tender cuts of meat will be more tasty if you marinate them first. If you have a favorite rub, seasoning, or marinade for steaks, feel free to use it.

Remove the skillet from the oven and place the steak in it. Use an oven mitt to remove the cast iron skillet so you don't burn your hand. Carefully place the steak in the skillet using tongs.
