Grab a measuring tape and calculate how far you want to extend your cable cord by measuring from the end of the cord to the location where you want to plug it in. Write this measurement down to determine how long of an extension cable you need.Tip: You can physically extend a single cord by cutting and crimping it, but there\u2019s no need if you already have a cable cord installed. It\u2019s much easier to use a coupler to connect an extension cable since there is no cutting involved. Add 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) to this measurement if you want some slack in the cord."
