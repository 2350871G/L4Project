Grinding the floor without burnishing it usually leads to a good finish. However, adding the sealer makes the finish even better.

Also, make sure yours has a skirt and vacuum to contain dust. Check your local hardware store to see if they have grinding machines available for rent. The machines are somewhat expensive, so you could also call a professional cleaner to take care of the floor for you. Another way to polish stone is by applying a polishing powder. Wet it with water according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, then use a 175 rpm buffing pad to work it into the floor. Scrub the floor with a 30-grit diamond pad. Always start with the lowest-grit pad you have available. Fit it on the underside of the machine, then begin pushing it along the width of the floor. Start at the tail end of the room and work toward the exit. Move the grinder at a slow but steady pace to ensure it is effective on the entire floor. If you\u2019re using a grinding machine without a dust vacuum, put on a dust mask before working on the floor. Vacuum up remaining dust after finishing the floor. Most grinders have a hard time reaching corners. To remedy this, rent a separate edging machine and push it along the walls. Spray a chemical hardener on the floor. Hardeners, also called densifiers, are meant to seal flooring to prevent stains and powdery dust from settling on it. Choose a hardener that matches the type of floor you\u2019re polishing. Then, apply the polish with a spray bottle or a hand-pumped sprayer. Coat the entire floor with an even, consistent layer of the polish. Some grinding machines have a built-in liquid dispenser. If yours has one, take advantage of it to get a more consistent application of the hardener. You don\u2019t have to wait for the hardener to dry before continuing to polish the floor. For maximum effect, add a new coating of hardener each time you swap out grinding disks. Switch to a 300-grit grinding disk and treat the floor again. Swap out disks, then push the grinder to the rear part of the room. After activating it, work back toward the exist. Make sure you cover the entire floor. The new grinding disk will smooth out the finish left by the rougher disk. To get a better finish, use any lower-grit disks you have available before finishing with the 300-grit one. It may seem like a lot of work, but your floor will have a better polish if you use a bunch of different disks. For example, polish the floor with an 80 and 150-grit disk, then follow up with the 300-grit one. If you don\u2019t have other disks, just use the 300-grit one. Finish grinding the floor with a 1,500 or 3,000-grit disk. Change out the 300-grit disk for the highest-grit one you have available. If you have multiple high-grit disks, use them in order from lowest to highest in order to get a better finish. Start at the tail end of the room and work your way forward once more. After you finish, the floor will already look much shinier than it did before. For example, you might use an 400-grit disc, followed by an 800-grit one, and then finish with the 1,500 or 3,000 one. If you take the time to use the disks in order, your floor will end up much shinier than usual. Apply a stone or concrete sealer with a burnishing pad to further shine it. Spread the appropriate sealer using a mop or sprayer, then switch the grinding disk out for a burnishing pad. Go back over the entire floor to work the sealer into it. The pad buffs the floor without grinding it, giving it a bright, clean, and protective finish similar to wax or oil. Grinding the floor without burnishing it usually leads to a good finish. However, adding the sealer makes the finish even better. Stone and concrete floors have to be sealed once a year to keep them waterproof. The best time to reseal the floor is right after grinding it.",
