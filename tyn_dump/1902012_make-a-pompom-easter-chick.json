Use scissors to cut a short piece of yellow yarn, about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) long, and drape it between the 2 middle prongs of a fork. You will eventually use this piece of yarn to tie your pompom together. You can use your index, middle, ring, and pinkie fingers for a bigger pompom. Drape the yarn between your middle and ring fingers. You can also just buy a pack of pompoms. If you wish to use store bought pompoms, click here to continue. Wrap the rest of your yarn 40 to 50 times around all of the fork's prongs. Find the end of your ball of yellow yarn. Drape the end across the prongs of the fork, then wrap the yarn 40 to 50 times around it. Ignore the short piece of yarn from the previous step for this. You are wrapping the yarn around all of the prongs at once, not weaving it. Cut the yarn, then tie the short piece tightly around the middle. Cut the yarn first so that it lines up with the side edge of the fork\u2019s prongs. Take the ends of the short piece of yarn from the first step, and tie them as tightly together as you can. Make a tight, double-knot so that it doesn't come undone. Slide the wrapped yarn off of the fork, then cut the looped ends. Carefully slide the wrapped yarn off of the fork first. Next, use scissors to cut open the looped ends on the left and right sides of the yarn bundle. Don't cut the looped ends off. Slide the bottom blade of your scissors through the left side of the bundle, then cut the ends. Repeat for the right. Trim the pompom and roll it between your palms. Your pompom probably won't turn out even, so find the bits of yarn that stick out too much, and trim them down so that they are level with the rest of the yarn. Roll the pompom between your palms so that it becomes more fluffy. Rolling the pompom between your palms will help dislodge any loose bits of yarn fuzz. You may have to do this step twice, especially if too much yarn comes out when you roll it. Repeat the process to make a second pompom if desired. There are 2 styles of chick that you can make: a super-simple chick consisting of 1 pompom, or a more detailed chick consisting of 2 pompoms. If you decide to make a second pompom, trim it a little smaller than the first pompom; this will make the head. Use the same color of yarn as the first pompom. Assembling the Chick Glue the smaller pompom on top of the bigger pompom. Hot glue will work the best because it dries within minutes, but you can also use fabric glue or tacky glue. Another option is to sew the 2 pompoms together with a needle and thread. Skip this step if you are making a super-simple chick using 1 pompom.

Glue the feet to the bottom of the larger pompom so that the notches stick out like toes. For simpler feet, cut a pair of bunny ears instead. You want something that looks like an M-shape. Use an orange pipe cleaner for the feet if you don't want to use felt.
