Poster putty adhesives are often known as Blu-Tac, Sticky-Tac etc. Play dough is another option that will work just as well as poster tack. Take a small blob of the putty adhesive. Roll it into a small ball. Use the ball to roll over the glittered area of your hands. Roll and dab the ball all over your hands, it will collect the glitter onto the tack ball. Continue until the glitter has all come off. Finish up. Toss the tack in the disposal and give your hands a good wash in warm, soapy water. You're good to go now. Coconut oil [1]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Purchase or find coconut oil (either in its liquid or solid form). If you need to warm it, do not use it until it has cooled enough to be safe on skin. However, you can use it in its solid form for this, so there really isn't a need to heat it up. Rub the coconut oil over the glittered area of your hands. Use a circular motion to circle small areas at a time, removing the glitter as you go. Wipe your skin with a damp cotton face washer or a commercial wipe product. This will remove both the coconut oil and the glitter from your skin. Continue until all glitter has been removed. Finish up. Wash your hands in warm, soapy water. This will remove any remaining glitter and oil and leave them nice and clean. Lotion or Makeup Remover[2]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Purchase or find your favorite lotion or makeup/eye makeup remover.  Rub the lotion or makeup remover over the glittered part of your skin. Use small circular motions to capture the glitter. Wipe the lotion or makeup remover off using a dampened cotton wool pads/balls or a commercial wipe. Discard of the pads/balls or wipes after they cease to collect glitter and replace with a fresh one. Continue until all glitter has been removed. Finish up. Wash your hands in warm, soapy water. This will remove any remaining lotion and glitter. Using Masking Tape Purchase or find a roll of masking tape. Sellotape or sticking plasters can be used in place of masking tape if that is all you can find. However, be aware that these will be harsher on your skin. Tear off a length of masking tape that is easy to handle. You can either use the length or form little balls with the sticky side facing outward. Just be careful not to make sharp edges that will poke into your skin. Place the length or ball of masking tape over the glittered part of your hands.

Continue until all of the glitter has been collected. Finish up. When done, wash your hands with warm, soapy water and discard the used masking tape. Removing Glitter Glue Purchase or select rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover.  Soak a cotton pad or ball in the rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover.  Dab and gently rub over the area of skin with glitter glue stuck to it. Hold the soaked pad or ball in place for half a minute or so, to allow the liquid to react with the glue. Peel off whatever is ready to come off with ease.  Wash the rest off using warm, soapy water and gentle scrubbing.
