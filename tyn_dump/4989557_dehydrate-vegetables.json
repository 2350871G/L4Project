        "If it feels brittle enough to snap in two, it has dried out.",
        "Bring the tray inside at sunset.",
        "If your veggies haven\u2019t dried out in one day, keep them safe from dew and other moisture that might saturate them overnight.",
        "Relocate the tray to a warm, dry area indoors.",
        "As long as tomorrow\u2019s weather promises to be warm, sunny, and dry, set the tray outside again in the morning.",
        "If a change in weather prevents you from finishing sun-drying your veggies, finish the process in your oven.",
        "Using Your Oven Preheat your oven.",
        "Set the temperature between 120 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "To dry vegetables faster, preheat the oven to 200 degrees.",
        "However, if you do so, lower the heat between 120 and 140 after the first hour of drying.",
        "Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures at 200 or higher will cause the vegetables to cook, rather than dry.",
        "Arrange your prepped vegetables.",
        "Use an oven-safe stainless steel mesh screen as a drying tray so air can circulate underneath your veggies.",
        "Spread them so that no pieces touch each other, which will also improve air circulation.",
        "If you are filling more than one tray, do so with equal portions, so that each tray dries evenly.",
        "If you use a cookie sheet instead of a mesh screen, be sure to line it with baking paper before arranging your vegetables.",
        "Place your tray inside the oven.",
        "If using a mesh screen as a tray, consider placing a sheet of aluminum foil on the rack below to catch any moisture that may drip.",
        "Keep the oven door open by at least a 3-inch crack.",
        "Allow the moisture from the vegetables to escape, as well as any excess heat, so that your oven maintains an even temperature of 140 degrees and no higher.",
        "Keep an eye on any pets or small children during this process.",
        "Rearrange your vegetables.",
        "If using a cookie sheet, flip your veggies over so both sides are evenly dried.",
        "Reverse the placement of your tray if your oven doesn\u2019t heat up evenly.",
        "If drying more than one tray, rotate their positions.",
        "Do so every two hours, since some vegetables may dry in as little as three to four.",
        "Check for dryness.",
        "Remove a piece from the tray and let it cool.",
        "Push your finger into the flesh to see if any juices come out.",
        "Gently try to bend it to see if it is too tough or brittle to do so.",
        "Return the piece to the oven if it bends without snapping or emits moisture when you press it.",
        "If not, remove the tray from the oven.",
        "Using an Electric Dehydrator Set up your dehydrator.",
        "Take the lid off and take all the trays out.",
        "Choose a bare, level surface to place the base.",
        "Make sure the surface is dry to avoid electric and fire hazards.",
        "Check each vent to make sure they are clear of any blockage.",
        "Arrange your prepped vegetables.",
        "Use a tray with handles for your first load.",
        "Place your veggies on the smooth side of the tray.",
        "Make sure they do not overlap or touch to ensure quicker drying times.",
        "Then set the first tray onto the dehydrator\u2019s base.",
        "For your next layer, use a handleless tray.",
        "Load it with veggies as you did with the first tray, and then set the second tray on top of the first.",
        "As you add more trays, continue stacking them with a handleless tray sandwiched in between those with handles.",
        "Dry your vegetables.",
        "Replace the lid over the topmost tray once you have finished stacking them.",
        "Plug the base in.",
        "Refer to your dehydrator\u2019s instructions for recommended drying times.",
        "If one tray\u2019s veggies appear dry while others\u2019 still seem moist, empty the dry tray and then return it to its place in the stack.",
        "Let the other trays continue to dehydrate until they feel crisp enough to break easily.",
        "Drying times will vary by method and equipment used, but expect windows of:\n\nAsparagus: 5 to seven hours\n\nGreen beans: 5 to 10 hours\n\nBeets: 3 to 6 hours\n\nBroccoli: 3 to 7 hours\n\nCarrots: 3 to 9 hours\n\nCauliflower: 4 to 7 hours\n\nCelery: 2 to 4 hours\n\nCorn: 6 to 10 hours\n\nMushrooms: 2 to 6 hours\n\nOnions: 2 to 6 hours\n\nPeas: 4 to 8 hours\n\nPeppers: 5 to 9 hours\n\nPotatoes: 3 to 7 hours\n\nSquash: 3 to 5 hours\n\nTomatoes: 5 to 10 hours Prepping and Storing Use fresh produce.",
        "Be aware that dehydrating your vegetables will preserve them as is.",
        "Do not expect underripe vegetables to continue ripening after rehydration.",
        "Cut or slice any areas that appear overripe, bruised, or blemished.",
        "Wash your vegetables before drying.",
        "Wash them with cold water under a running faucet.",
        "Do so even if you plan on peeling your vegetables before dehydrating them, since your peeler may transfer dirt or chemicals from the skin to the flesh.",
        "Use a cloth or paper towel to pat them dry afterward.",
        "Slice your produce.",
        "Allow your vegetables to dehydrate evenly.",
        "Cut larger veggies into smaller, roughly uniform pieces.",
        "Be sure to follow these basic slicing guidelines:\n\n\u215b\u201d slices: beets; carrots.",
        "\u00bc\u201d slices: carrots; celery; onions; peppers; potatoes; squash.",
        "\u215c\u201d slices: mushrooms\n\n\u00be\u201d slices: tomatoes\n\n1\u201d pieces: asparagus; broccoli; cauliflower; green beans Blanch your vegetables before drying.",
        "Preserve certain veggies\u2019 flavor and color by ridding them of enzymes that might strip their flavor and color over time.",
        "Either submerge them in boiling water, or place them in a steaming tray over boiling water.",
        "Follow the recommended times for the following veggies:\n\nAsparagus: 3.5 to 4.5 minutes in boiling water; 4 to 5 with steam.",
        "Green beans: 2 minutes in boiling water; 2 to 2.5 with steam.",
        "Broccoli: 2 minutes in boiling water; 3 to 3.5 steam.",
        "Carrots: 3 minutes in boiling water; 3 to 3.5 steam.",

        "Celery: 2 minutes in boiling water or with steam.",
        "Corn: 1.5 minutes in boiling water; 2-2.5 with steam.",
        "Peas: 2 minutes in boiling water; 3 with steam\n\nPotatoes: 5 to 6 minutes in boiling water; 6 to 8 with steam.",
        "Squash: 1.5 minutes in boiling water; 2.5 to 3 with steam.",
        "Store your dried vegetables safely.",
        "After they have dehydrated, transfer them to a clean, sealable container to keep out air and moisture.",
        "If you dried multiple kinds of vegetables, store each one separately to avoid crossing flavors.",
        "Store them in an area that is cool, dark, and dry.",
        "Vegetables should last 6 months in average temperatures of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 3 months in 80 degrees.",
        "Finished."
