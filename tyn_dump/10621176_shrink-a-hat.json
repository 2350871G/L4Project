If your hat doesn't have a bill, also mist its front end. Soaking the hat increases the chances that the colors run. Use a little bit of water at a time and make sure the fabric isn't dripping wet. For a hat with a bill, such as a fitted baseball cap, leave the front panels above the bill dry. This helps the cap keep its shape."

Point the dryer directly at the cap, but keep moving it back and forth to prevent the fabric from getting too hot. Stop when the cap feels dry to the touch. Concentrate the heat on the main portion of the hat rather than the brim. Most hats have an elastic band or sweatband in the brim, and heating it causes it to lose shape over time."

Exposing the hat to sunlight or hot water causes the fabric to shrink down to its natural size. Wearing the hat improves the fit even if you choose not to risk the oven or dryer.
