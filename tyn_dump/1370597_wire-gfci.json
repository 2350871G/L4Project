Wiring Procedure for 2 Cables (4 to 6 wires) One cable (or pair of wires) typically supplies power to the first outlet device and the other carries power to other devices further down the line. You will need to determine which is which. There are many ways to determine which cable is the \"supply\", using various test instruments (contact, non-contact, meters, etc). The following technique is for those who are unfamiliar with such things or who do not wish to touch the wiring while it is \"live\". Detach 1 white \"neutral\" and 1 black \"hot\" wire from one of the two cables and put a wire cap on each of them. Ensure the wires come from the same cable or conduit. Reinstall the receptacle into the electrical box and restore power at the main fuse or breaker box.  Plug in a night light or other device and press the \"Reset\" button (if necessary) to determine if power is flowing into the receptacle. If the power returns to the device, the capped lines are \"load\" lines, or lines that can be strung together to give GFCI protection to multiple outlets. If no power comes on in the receptacle, your capped wires are probably the \"line\" wires or your main power wires, assuming they are working properly. You may also want to test the capped wires to make sure the GFCI will have power before proceeding. You may do this with a separate tester or by repeating the previous testing steps with the cables swapped. Turn the power off at your main panel and take out the receptacle. Label your \"line\" and \"load\" wires. Attach your \"line\" white wire to the silver \"line\" terminal of the GFCI. Attach your \"line\" black wire to the brass \"hot\" terminal of the \"line\" section of the GFCI. Remove the yellow sticker (or other colored tape) that covers the \"load\" terminals on the receptacle. You will hook your remaining circuit wires to these terminals. Connect your \"load\" white wire to the silver \"load\" terminal and your \"load\" black wire to the \"hot\" brass \"load\" terminal.  Attach your ground wires to the green grounding screw of the GFCI. Fold your wires into the box, making sure the grounding wires do not touch any exposed\"line\" or \"load\" terminals. Attach the cover plate. Many electricians wrap each receptacle with a layer of insulating electrician's tape before reinstalling them into a box, especially a metal box. This provides another layer of safety from accidental contact with live parts. Testing the GFCI Turn on the power at the main panel and plug in a lamp or night light into the outlet and switch it on.

        "Adding GFCI at Service Panel Consider whether you need a GFCI circuit breaker.",
        "In some cases it may be best to have an electrician install a GFCI circuit breaker in the panel, rather than a GFCI receptacle.",
        "The GFCI breaker has a protected \"hot\" conductor, a separate neutral connection, as well as a test and reset button.",
        "It will protect all devices on that entire branch, if properly installed.",
        "Don't attempt this one as a DIY job if you don't have extensive electrical experience.",
        "It can be very dangerous to work on exposed circuit breakers, even if you believe the main breaker (or feed) has been disconnected.",
        "Some newer installations may require an AFCI breaker as well as GFCI protection for some circuit branches.",
        "Combination AFCI/GFCI breakers may be an elegant way to solve that  complicated problem."
