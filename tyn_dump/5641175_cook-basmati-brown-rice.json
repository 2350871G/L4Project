        "Stirring it while it's cooking activates the starch and makes it either sticky or creamy.",
        "Bring it to a boil and then simmer.",
        "Turn the burner to high.",
        "Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 15-40 minutes until all the water is absorbed.",
        "The time difference is largely based upon how long you soaked the rice.",
        "If you soaked it for 30 minutes, your cook time will be closer to 40 minutes.",
        "If you soaked it overnight, your cook time will be closer to 15 minutes.",
        "It's very important to turn down the heat and to simmer once the water boils.",
        "Rice that's cooked too fast on a high heat will be hard because the water will evaporate.",
        "The kernels will also break.",
        "Test to see if it's done.",
        "Quickly remove the lid and use a fork to scoop out some of the rice.",
        "Immediately replace the lid.",
        "If the rice is tender and the water has fully absorbed, it's ready.",
        "If not, continue cooking another 2-4 minutes.",
        "You may need to add more water if it's not tender but the water has fully absorbed.",
        "Start slowly by adding just a \u20444 cup (60 ml) of water.",
        "Remove the pot from the burner and cover with a towel.",
        "When done, take the pot from the burner and remove the lid.",
        "Place a folded kitchen towel over the pot, and promptly replace the lid.",
        "The towel will help to steam the rice, making it fluffier.",
        "It also absorbs extra moisture that would otherwise fall back onto the rice.",
        "Let the rice sit for 10 minutes.",
        "Don\u2019t lift the lid while you let the rice rest or you'll lose the steam necessary to fully cook it.",
        "Remove the towel and lid and fluff the rice.",
        "Use a fork to fluff the rice while it's in the pot.",
        "Then let the rice sit uncovered for just a few minutes so it doesn't have a wet texture.",
        "Using a fork helps the remaining steam to escape and the grains to separate.",
        "Scoop and serve.",
        "Use a large spoon or a nonstick rice paddle spoon to scoop out the rice.",
        "Serve it now alone or as part of another dish.",
        "Cooking Brown Basmati Rice in a Rice Cooker Read the instructions carefully.",
        "There are a variety of rice cookers on the market, and they don\u2019t all operate in the same way or have the same features.",
        "For instance, some will have both white and brown rice settings.",
        "Others won\u2019t have either.",
        "Combine the water and rice.",
        "Use a wooden spoon or rice paddle spoon to mix 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice and 3 cups (710 ml) of water into the inner pot of the rice cooker.",
        "Many rice cookers come with a dry measuring cup.",
        "However, they\u2019re often only equivalent to 3/4 of a standard cup.",
        "Don\u2019t use metal utensils when mixing or scooping because they can damage the non-stick coating of the inner pots.",
        "Put on the lid and turn it to cook.",
        "Generally rice cookers have two settings \u2013 cook and warm \u2013 so make sure you select cook.",
        "This will bring the water to a boil very quickly.",
        "Once the rice has absorbed all the water, the temperature will rise past the boiling point of water (100\u02daC/212\u02daF).",
        "At this point, most rice cookers will then automatically switch to the warm setting.",
        "This will typically take about 30 minutes.",
        "The warm setting will hold the rice at a safe serving temperature until you turn off the cooker.",
        "Don\u2019t take off the lid during cooking.",
        "As with the boiling method, don\u2019t lift the lid while the rice is cooking or the water vapor needed to cook it will disperse.",
        "Let the rice rest in the cooker.",
        "After it switches to warm, keep the lid closed and let the rice sit for 5-10 minutes to finish cooking.",
        "Open the cooker and fluff the rice.",
        "Carefully open the lid away from your face to avoid being burned by any excess steam.",
        "Use a wooden or rice paddle spoon to gently fluff the rice.",
        "Dish it out.",
        "You can serve it now or save it for later in the refrigerator or freezer.",
        "If refrigerating, put the rice into a bowl and cover with a lid or saran wrap.",
        "It should keep for 3-4 days.",
        "Don't leave it out for more than two hours before refrigerating.",
        "If freezing, rinse it in cool water, place portions in zip lock bags and place them in the freezer.",
        "Thaw the rice in the baggies overnight in the refrigerator.",
        "Pressure Cooking Brown Basmati Rice Combine the water, rice and salt.",
        "Mix 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice, 2.5 cups (590 ml) of water and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt in the pressure cooker and turn the burner to medium-high or high heat to reach high pressure.",
        "Secure the lid.",
        "Begin timing when the pressure cooker reaches high pressure.",
        "Various models will have different types of valves to alert you when the pressure cooker is at high pressure.",
        "Those with spring valves generally have a bar or rod that rises; jiggler valves will rock and jiggle slowly at first and then rapidly; weight-modified valves will whistle and hiss as they lift up and down.",
        "Decrease the heat and continue cooking.",
        "Reduce the burner's temperature until the pressure cooker has stabilized and let the rice keep cooking.",
        "The total time from reaching high pressure until you're done should be between 12-15 minutes.",
        "Again, the time depends upon the amount of time you pre-soaked the rice.",
        "Turn off the heat.",
        "Allow the temperature and pressure to drop naturally for about 10-15 minutes after turning off the heat.",
        "The safety-locking mechanism will disengage or an indicator will alert you that the pressure has dropped.",
        "Alternatively, put on oven mitts and place the pressure cooker in the sink.",
        "Run cold water over it to decrease the pressure.",
        "Then remove the valve and push the button/twist/press the lever to release water vapor and any remaining pressure.",
        "Either way, be careful while doing this and know from where the vapor will shoot out so you aren't burned.",
        "Fluff the rice and serve.",
        "Use a fork to fluff the rice and serve now, or refrigerate or freeze for later use."
