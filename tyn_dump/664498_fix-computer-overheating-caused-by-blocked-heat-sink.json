Also, you should regularly open the case unplug all the cords and carefully take your computer system outside use a can of compressed air or an air compressor. A small vacuum is a good second choice but you have to be careful not to hit any internal components with it, and avoid touching the circuit boards with anything. Take your time and be very thorough with this step. Next take a cotton swab dabbed in some rubbing alcohol and go over the internal case components to get them very clean. You can go over the external case with a rag and a little bit of water. Allow your system 2 hours to dry out before turning it back on."
