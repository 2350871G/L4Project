This may take some reshaping until you're satisfied with the end result, so use light and even pencil strokes. Follow the image for help (you can even trace over the image until you have the knack of drawing it yourself). This is a good point to draw the eyes. The image here uses anime style eyes, which give an ethereal and cute quality at the same time. You could experiment with other eye styles as well, if preferred. Detail her long hair; the character shown here has the hair in plaits but it can also be loose, drawn up into a bun or braided knots, etc. Whatever you choose, be sure to make it a feature of the female elf."
