Partial shade is also acceptable, and most viburnums will still do well in it. Partial shade happens in areas that get four to six hours of direct sunlight a day. For example, partial shade can be behind your house. The area be sunny in the morning, but get covered by the house\u2019s shadow later on. Full shade areas, such as those under larger plants, get less than three hours of direct sunlight a day.
