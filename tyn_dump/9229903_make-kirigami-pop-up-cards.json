        "You should use 85-pound A4 or 8\u00bd by 11-inch (21.59 by 27.94-centimeter) cardstock paper.",
        "White is the most traditional and popular, but you can use other colors if you really want to.",
        "Cut along the solid black lines using a sharp craft knife.",
        "Start with the smaller, inside shapes first, then move onto the larger ones.",
        "Next, do the smaller, detailed shapes on the outside, such as the curves, corners, and points.",
        "Finish off with the largest shapes.",
        "Do not cut along the dotted lines.",
        "Score across the dashed lines.",
        "You must do this very carefully so that you don't accidentally cut through the paper.",
        "Lightly run your craft blade across whatever dashed lines that you see on your design.",
        "Fold your paper across the scored lines.",
        "The direction you fold in depends on the design you chose.",
        "In most cases, you will have to fold the cut shape down towards the rest of the paper.",
        "Assemble the cut shapes as indicated by the design.",
        "Most of these types of designs have mirroring slots that interlock with each other.",
        "Hold the two cut pieces parallel to the floor, then angle them so that they form an X.",
        "Slide them together at the slot, then flatten them.",
        "You should have something that resembles a rectangle with your interlocked shapes in the middle.",
        "Choose a sheet of cardstock to act as the base.",
        "It can be a solid color or patterned, but it needs to be the same weight and size as the previous sheet: 85-pounds, and A4 or 8\u00bd by 11-inch (21.59 by 27.94-centimeter.",
        "Fold the base cardstock in half widthwise, then unfold it.",
        "For a neater finish, run your fingernail or a bone folder across the fold before you unfold it.",
        "This will give you a sharper crease.",
        "Cut down the interlocked cardstock so that it is smaller than your base cardstock.",
        "How much you cut off depends on the design itself and how much is being interlocked.",
        "In general, however, you want the interlocked cardstock to be \u00bd to 1 inch (2.5 cm) smaller on each side than the base cardstock.",
        "Cut the paper using a craft blade and a metal ruler.",
        "Glue the interlocked cardstock to the base cardstock.",
        "Make sure that the base cardstock is oriented so that the fold is a valley (V-shaped).",
        "Run a glue stick around the back edges of the interlocked cardstock, then set it down on top of the base, making sure that it is centered.",
        "You can also use glue dots or double-sided tape.",
        "Embellish the kirigami, if desired.",
        "You can leave your kirigami as-is, or you can embellish it with glitter.",
        "Lightly outline the edges glitter glue, then let the glue dry.",
        "If you don't have any glitter glue, paint your desired lines using a thin, pointed brush and liquid glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter on top; be sure to shake the excess glitter off.",
        "Creating Your Own Design Get a cutting mat, a craft blade, and a metal ruler.",
        "The cutting mat is important and will protect your work surface.",
        "The craft blade must be very sharp and have a sharp point, like an X-acto blade.",
        "The metal rule is not essential, but it will you with cutting straight lines.",
        "If your knife doesn't cut the paper easily, it is too dull.",
        "Switch the blade out for a new one.",
        "Choose between lightweight and heavyweight cardstock.",
        "This depends on your design and preferences.",
        "Heavyweight will work for most designs, but a lighter weight might work better for more delicate, intricate designs.",
        "Most traditional designs use white cardstock, but you can use a different color if you really want to.",
        "Understand how kirigami works.",
        "Kirigami starts with a rectangular sheet of paper and a center-fold (widthwise).",
        "Making cuts below and above this line help create a three-dimensional object.",
        "For example, to make a cube:\nMake two parallel cuts across the central fold.",
        "They need to be twice as tall as they are apart.",
        "Mountain fold the crease between the parallel lines so that it sticks out.",
        "Valley fold between the two parallel lines at the top and bottom.",
        "Create your design on a sheet of paper or a computer program.",
        "Use solid black lines for everything that needs to be cut, and dotted lines for everything that needs to be folded.",
        "If your deign uses for valley and mountain folds, consider using straight, colored lines instead.",
        "For example, you could use red lines for valley folds and green lines for mountain folds.",
        "Check the distances between your cuts and folds and how they relate to each other.",
        "Don't be afraid to layer planes in front of others to create depth.",
        "Start with simple designs first, then build your way up to more complex ones.",
        "Cut along the your solid, black lines.",
        "Use your metal ruler, as needed, and leave the dotted or colored lines alone.",
        "Start with the details and inside shapes first, then move on to the larger shapes.",
        "Finish with the outside shapes that make up the body of the design.",
        "For example, if you were cutting a house:\nBegin with small details, like doorknobs.",
        "Move onto the doors and paneled windows.",
        "Finish with the outline of the house.",
        "Score along your fold lines, if desired.",
        "This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help make your folds sharper and give you a crisper finish.",
        "Lightly run your knife along the dotted or colored fold lines; be careful not to cut through the paper.",
        "Fold along the dotted, colored, or scored lines.",
        "Make the creases nice and sharp.",
        "You could even fold against the edge of your ruler, then run your fingernail across the crease.",
        "Pay attention to your color coding, if you used it!",
        "Mount your artwork onto a larger sheet of colored cardstock.",
        "If you can't find cardstock that's larger, you can cut down your kirigami first.",
        "Fold the colored cardstock in half, then glue the kirigami inside it.",
        "If you used thin paper and want to display it instead, consider putting some colored LED lights behind it."
