        "Clean your frog\u2019s aquarium once a week.",
        "Regular cleanings will help prevent your frog from getting sick.",
        "To clean out its aquarium, carefully transfer your frog to a separate container that it won\u2019t be able to escape from.",
        "Then, replace the substrate at the bottom of the tank with fresh, clean substrate, and remove any uneaten insects and debris in the tank.",
        "Next, take out the perches and any fake plants and scrub and rinse them with water to clean them off.",
        "You should also replace the water in your frog\u2019s soaking dish with fresh spring or dechlorinated water.",
        "Finally, wipe down the inside of the tank with paper towels.",
        "Avoid using any cleaners other than water since they\u2019re not safe for gray tree frogs.",
        "Wash your hands before and after handling your frog.",
        "Generally, it\u2019s best to only handle your gray tree frog if absolutely necessary, like when you\u2019re moving it to a separate container to clean its tank.",
        "When you do handle your frog, it\u2019s important that you wash your hands first so you don\u2019t transfer any oils or potentially toxic substances to your frog\u2019s skin.",
        "You should also wash your hands after handling your frog since gray tree frogs secrete a toxin that can cause extreme discomfort if it makes contact with your eyes, mouth, or nose, as well as any cuts or abrasions you have.",

        "A vet should be able to determine what\u2019s wrong with your frog and prescribe the right treatment plan.",
        "Some common warning signs that there might be something wrong with your frog that you should keep an eye out for include:\nInactivity\nWeight loss\nBloating\nBlotchy skin\nCloudy eyes\nSwelling"
