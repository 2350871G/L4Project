Before you leave school, try to ask the teacher or another student to explain any assignments with instructions that aren\u2019t clear to you. Once you clearly understand what your teacher wants you to do, then you can begin focusing on your work. Sometimes it might be helpful to see if your school offers tutoring, especially if you find that confusion over your homework is often why you struggle to focus on it. Working with a tutor will definitely help you stay on task with your school work and help improve your grades, as well."

Writing your assignments in a planner will help you visualize your day, week, or month ahead and help you plan your assignments around work and social events. This will help you stay focused on your work and keep you from becoming overwhelmed, which can lead to procrastinating. You can use either a physical notebook-style planner or download an app on your phone or tablet. Be sure to organize your planner. Using color coded tabs or sticky notes can help you keep track of your assignments work, and extracurricular schedule. For example, use blue tabs to denote upcoming assignments or tests, red tabs to show your work schedule, and yellow tabs to show your social schedule. If you use a physical planner, be sure to keep it neat. A chaotic-looking planner that you can't read or understand won't help you focus. Avoid scribbling out words or writing illegibly. Write neatly and be sure to write in erasable pencil or use white out to make changes to assignments written in ink."

This will help keep you focused on assignments as they come due and keep you from getting bogged down by trying to do too many assignments at once. For example, if you have a 5 page English paper that\u2019s due in a week, that assignment should take priority over a science project that\u2019s due in a month. Tests should always be marked as high priority in your planner. Take into account how long assignments will take, as well. Think about the \"big picture\" of your school schedule. Instead of only focusing on what is due in the next few days, for example, take a macro view and consider what assignments are due this month. Then, as time allows, make an effort to chip away at future projects. This way, when those due dates approach, you won't have to rush and stress out over how to find the time to complete those assignments."

The amount of time you\u2019ll need to set aside will vary based on how much homework you have and how difficult your assignments are, so be sure to allot enough time to complete your work.

        "The computer can be just as distracting and addicting as your phone, so it\u2019s important to minimize distractions there, as well.",
        "Because you likely need the internet to do a lot of your assignments, it\u2019s not as simple to \u201cdisconnect\u201d while you\u2019re on a computer.",
        "You\u2019ll need to actively stay off of social media and gaming sites in order to focus on your work.",
        "Consider browser extensions that disconnect social media for you.",
        "Browser extensions like Nanny (Google Chrome) and Mac Freedom (Windows and Mac compatible) block your access to your top time-wasting websites.",
        "Schedule work breaks.",
        "After working for a solid 45 minutes, give yourself a break for 15 minutes.",
        "Get up and stretch, have a snack, or check your phone.",
        "This will help you reset and recharge so you can continue focusing on your school work.",
        "Make sure that you set a timer or alarm clock so that your breaks are only 15 minutes.",
        "Dragging breaks out longer can derail your efforts to focus on and complete your school work.",
        "Set a goal and reward yourself for completing it.",
        "Homework is no fun.",
        "However, if you set attainable goals for yourself and reward yourself for completing them, it will help make school work seem less overwhelming.",
        "For example, tell yourself that you need to finish your algebra homework within an hour so that you can watch your favorite show before bed.",
        "Setting a goal with a clear reward at the end will help motivate you to stay focused on completing your work.",
        "Maintaining Realistic Expectations for Yourself Work on 1 assignment at a time.",
        "Pacing yourself is important because it is easy to become overwhelmed and distracted if you try to work on too many assignments at once.",
        "Approach your homework one piece at a time, and work on each piece to completion.",
        "Avoid having two or three half-completed assignments, as this can be stressful.",
        "Don\u2019t try to do too much at once.",
        "Make sure that you aren\u2019t setting yourself up for failure by setting unrealistic goals for yourself.",
        "Trying to complete too much school work in too short a time is a recipe for stress and discouragement.",
        "For example, don\u2019t expect that you can come home from school and spend an hour writing a quality ten page paper.",
        "Research papers take time to both write and research, so it\u2019s unrealistic to expect to squeeze all of that work into one evening.",
        "Instead, spread your writing and research out across several days to make the project more manageable.",
        "Speak with your guidance counselor or advisor.",
        "If you are truly struggling to focus on your school work despite taking steps to help refocus yourself, try speaking with your advisor or guidance counselor.",
        "He or she might be able to help you see issues that you missed, such as an overly heavy course load.",
        "Asking for their help is nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "In fact, it\u2019s their job to help you when you are struggling!",
        "Take care of yourself.",
        "Even the best time management and homework techniques won\u2019t be helpful if you aren\u2019t taking care of yourself first.",
        "Be sure that you are getting enough sleep and eating properly.",
        "Pulling all-nighters to complete your homework might work in the short term.",
        "However, this technique will backfire because you\u2019ll become exhausted and have even more difficulty focusing on your work.",
        "Don\u2019t skip meals, especially breakfast.",
        "Even if you aren\u2019t hungry in the mornings, have some juice or pack a portable snack like an apple or a granola bar for later.",
        "Talk with your doctor if nothing is helping you.",
        "If you have tried many different techniques to focus on your school work and spoken with your advisor or counselor, then it might be helpful for you to talk to your doctor about your struggles.",
        "He or she might test you for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to see if that could be the cause of your concentration problems.",
        "If your doctor determines that you have this disorder, then he or she might recommend medications, dietary changes, therapy, or a combination of these to Treat ADHD."
