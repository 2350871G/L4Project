Once the area is dry, remove the backing of the adhesive strips a little at a time as you press them into place on the door jambs and along the edges of the doorframe. Modern doors are usually designed with grooves along the sides and jambs that weatherstripping can be inserted into. Sometimes it can be difficult to apply an adhesive strip by yourself. Asking a friend to help you out can make this process quicker and easier. Depending on the fit of your door, you may not be able to attach adhesive strips along every edge of the door. If a strip prevents the door from closing properly, it should be removed. Adhesive strips are usually sold in different widths and thicknesses, which will allow you to choose the best size for the gaps along the edges of your individual door. Measure gaps with a tape measure or ruler."
