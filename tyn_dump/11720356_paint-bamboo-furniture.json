        "Continue working across the entire piece until there\u2019s a thin, even coat of primer.",
        "Test spraying the primer on your drop cloth or a piece of cardboard first to ensure it sprays evenly.",
        "Sometimes, the primer may clog and spray unevenly the first time you use it.",
        "If you don\u2019t apply primer before you start painting, the color won\u2019t stick on your furniture as well and the surface will look uneven.",
        "Allow the primer to dry for 30\u201360 minutes.",
        "Leave the piece of furniture in an area where it won\u2019t get disturbed so the primer has time to set.",
        "After about 30 minutes, lightly tap the surface with a finger to see if any of the primer lifts up.",
        "If the primer feels dry, then you can move on.",
        "Otherwise, allow it to sit for another 30 minutes before checking it again.",
        "Primer drying time may vary, so check the can you\u2019re using to see how long you should wait.",
        "Sand the primed surface with 220-grit sandpaper using light pressure.",
        "Work in circular motions to smooth out any raised areas of primer so you have a smooth painting surface to work with.",
        "Replace the piece of sandpaper as it gets dirty with dust from the primer.",
        "You can also use a sanding sponge instead if you have trouble getting a good grip on the sandpaper.",
        "Wipe the furniture with a damp microfiber cloth to clean off the primer dust.",
        "Dip a microfiber cloth in warm water and wring it out.",
        "Lightly rub the primed surface with the cloth to pick up any dust left on the surface from sanding the primer.",
        "Work your way over the entire piece of furniture until you don\u2019t lift up any more dust.",
        "You may also brush or vacuum the dust if you want.",
        "Painting the Furniture Choose an enamel spray paint for your furniture.",
        "Pick a color that matches or complements the other pieces of furniture in your home so it doesn\u2019t clash.",
        "Get 1\u20132 cans of the color to ensure you have enough to coat the entire piece.",
        "You can buy enamel spray paint from a hardware or paint supply store.",
        "Enamel spray paint works for both indoor and outdoor bamboo furniture.Tip: Avoid using acrylic spray paint if you plan on keeping the furniture outdoors since it could get damaged from water.",
        "Shake the can of paint and keep it 6 in (15 cm) from your furniture.",
        "Leave the cap on the can and shake it for about 15 seconds to properly mix the paint.",
        "Position the can upright and hold it about 6 inches (15 cm) from the piece of furniture to help prevent overspray.",
        "Apply a thin coat of the paint to the bamboo furniture.",
        "Press the button down that\u2019s on top of the can to start spraying the paint.",
        "Keep moving the can back and forth over the surface so you don\u2019t apply paint too thickly to one area.",
        "Work your way around the entire piece until you have an even coat of color.",
        "It\u2019s okay if you can still see some of the primer through the first coat of paint.",
        "Always work in thin layers since they\u2019ll dry faster and make the color look consistent across the entire piece of furniture.",
        "Let the spray paint dry for 30 minutes.",
        "Leave the furniture alone so it doesn\u2019t get disturbed while it\u2019s drying.",
        "After about 30 minutes, check if the paint feels dry to the touch.",
        "If it does, then continue working.",
        "Otherwise, wait another 15 minutes before checking the paint again.",
        "Drying time between coats may vary depending on the kind of spray paint you have, so always check the can you\u2019re using to find out how long they recommend you wait.",
        "Spray on additional coats until the furniture has an even finish.",
        "Start your next coat of paint and work over the entire surface of your furniture.",
        "Move the can around while you\u2019re spraying to keep the layer thin or even.",
        "Allow the coat to dry completely before checking if you need another one.",
        "Continue adding coats of paint and allowing them to dry until the furniture has a consistent color.",
        "Usually, it will take 2\u20133 coats of spray paint to finish your piece.",
        "Reattach the upholstery, cushions, and hardware if needed.",
        "Once the paint dries, set the cushions or upholstery back on the furniture.",
        "Use a screwdriver or a hammer to reattach the fasteners so the upholstery doesn\u2019t move around or shift."
