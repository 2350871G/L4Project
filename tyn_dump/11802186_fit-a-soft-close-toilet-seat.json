        "Many models of seats come with this type of top-fix mounting hardware for ease of installation.",
        "If your seat didn\u2019t come with special gaskets for the bolt holes, look for a pair of plastic wingnuts.",
        "These will go on the underside of the toilet pan when it comes time to fasten the seat.",
        "Place the seat on the toilet and make sure that it's nice and square.",
        "Double-check that the holes in the connected hinges are positioned directly over the bolt holes at the rear of the pan.",
        "Then, take the time to make any necessary last-minute micro-adjustments before screwing the seat down.Most quick-attach seats are designed to fit toilets with standard bolt spacings.",
        "As such, they may not allow for a high degree of customization.",
        "Insert the included fasteners through the seat hinges and into the bolt holes.",
        "If you find plastic washers in your mounting hardware, slip them over the bottom of the bolts or screws before you drop them in.",
        "They\u2019ll help protect the seat\u2019s hinges, which are often molded out of plastic, from becoming worn down by the metal fasteners.Screws almost always go into gaskets, while bolts are generally accompanied by wingnuts.Tip: On some models, it may be necessary to actually attach the mounting bolts to the hinges themselves.",
        "Secure the seat by tightening the fasteners, applying wingnuts if necessary.",
        "For seats with top-fix-style hardware, all you have to do is sink the mounting screws into their gaskets using a screwdriver of the appropriate size.",
        "For bottom-fix assemblies, thread a wingnut onto the bottom of each bolt, slide it up as far as it will go, and hold it in still with one hand while you screw down the mounting bolt from the top.A pair of plastic gaskets or wingnuts should be included in the mounting hardware that comes packaged with your new soft close seat.",
        "Lower the hinge covers and press down on them to snap them shut.",
        "You should hear a faint click or feel the covers\u2019 locking mechanisms engage when they close all the way.",
        "These pieces keep the mounting hardware concealed, giving your new seat a more seamless, aesthetically-pleasing look.",
        "When you need to remove your toilet seat, just flip the hinge covers up to expose the fasteners so you can get at them with your tools."
