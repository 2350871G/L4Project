        "Assemble your booklet.",
        "Make sure that all the pages are in order and that the paper is evenly aligned before inserting into the stapler.",
        "Decide how many staples are required down the spine of the booklet.",
        "Usually two will suffice (this is standard) but depending on the size of your booklet, one staple may suffice or you may need three or four.",
        "If you need more than one or two staples, it can be helpful to make small pencil marks in advance that show you where to position the stapler.",
        "With practice, this will likely become easier.",
        "Position your booklet with the outside cover facing upwards.",
        "Place it into the specialized stapler so that the center portion is aligned underneath the stapling mechanism.",
        "Make sure the booklet is aligned with the stapler, and that the margins on either side of the stapler are as close to the same width as possible.",
        "Push the stapler arm down on the spine where you want to place each staple.",
        "Once the stapler arm is aligned, push down on the end of the upper arm until you hear the staple go through the paper.",
        "Repeat the process above to align your stapler on a different place on the spine, and staple until the booklet has as many staples as you choose.",
        "Two or three staples are generally enough.",
        "Check that all staples have been properly inserted and sit flat.",
        "If any of them failed to puncture the paper, or did not close properly, remove them so you can try again.",
        "Do this by carefully unbending each arm of the staple until it is straight, then pushing it out through the hole made by the stapler."
