If your baby shower has a specific theme, such as jungles or oceans, then buy scrapbooking paper that matches that theme. Alternatively, choose paper with a neutral pattern, such as stripes or polka dots. Solid colors are a good choice too. If you are going with a solid color or a neutral pattern, you could match the color to your baby's gender. If you don't know your baby's gender or wish to keep it a surprise, stick with purple or yellow."

Measure the length and width of the paper wrapper, then cut your scrapbooking paper accordingly. If your candy has a single wrapper that's sealed on both ends, cut the paper to 3 times the width and about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) shorter. Use a paper cutter or paper slicer. It will make your work quick and easy. The paper needs to be a little shorter than the candy bar so that the foil ends are visible."

If your chocolate came wrapped in plastic, fold the sealed ends to the back and tape them down first. Wrap the foil paper around the chocolate.

        "You can use any color you want for the frame or label, but white with a dark outline will stand out the best.",
        "Insert a text box and write your message.",
        "It can be a simple word, like \"Baby Bar\" or even your baby's name.",
        "Once you have written your message, highlight the message, then adjust the font type, size, and color.",

        "Print the wrappers.",
        "For best results, use a laser printer; this will give you a nice, glossy finish that is similar to store-bought wrappers.",
        "If you don't have a laser printer at home, save the file to a USB flash drive, and take it to a print shop instead.",
        "How many copies you print depends on how many candy bars you have to cover.",
        "It would be a good idea to print a few extra copies in case you mess up, however.",
        "Regular printer paper will do just fine.",
        "If you don't have a laser printer, try printer paper with a semi-glossy finish (not photo paper).",
        "Cut the wrapper with a paper cutter or slicer.",

        "Buy silver foil paper, or choose a color that matches the paper wrapper you designed.",
        "If your chocolate came with a plastic wrapper, fold the sealed side edges onto the back, then tape them down.",
        "If your chocolate came with an outer foil wrapper, leave that on.",

        "Make sure that the design is centered, then fold the top and bottom edges over onto the back of the candy bar.",
        "Tape the top edge to the bottom edge with double-sided tape.",
        "The top and bottom edges should overlap.",
