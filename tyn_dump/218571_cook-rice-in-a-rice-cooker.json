                    "description": "Some rice cookers have a removable bowl or pot, while others must have the rice placed directly in the cooker. Most of the time, rice cookers will come with a measuring \"cup\" or scoop that can fit 3/4 cup (180 mL). Alternatively, use an ordinary measuring cup. One cup (240 mL) of uncooked rice will generate anywhere from 1 1/2 cups (360 mL) to three cups (720 mL) of cooked rice, depending on variety.

                    "description": "Many people prefer to rinse rice in order to remove any pesticides, herbicides, or contaminants that may be present. Some less modern milling practices also create broken grains that release excess starch into the rice, which needs to be rinsed off to prevent the rice clumping together. If you decide to rinse the rice, pour drinking water into the bowl or hold it under the faucet. Stir as you add the water, until the rice is fully submerged. Drain water through a sieve or tip the bowl slowly while catching fallen rice grains with your hand. If the water looks discolored or filled with floating bits of broken rice or dirt, rinse a second or third time until new water added looks relatively clear. White rice sold in the United States is required by law to be enriched with powdered iron, niacin, thiamin, or folic acid; these vitamins and minerals are usually removed by washing. If your rice cooker has a non-stick bowl, wash the rice (prior to cooking) in a colander with several washes/rinses/drains. Replacement non-stick bowls are very expensive."

        "Adding it back to the rice cooker without enough water to cover it could result in burning, or the rice cooker failing to turn on.",
        "Next time, simply add about 1/4\u20131/2 cup (30\u201360mL) of water per cup (240 mL) rice to the rice cooker before you turn it on.",
        "Remove rice promptly after cooking if the rice is frequently burned.",
        "A working rice cooker shouldn't burn rice during the cooking, but if left in \"warming\" mode, the rice at the bottom and sides can get burned.",
        "If this happens often, remove rice from the cooker as soon as you hear the \"click\" signifying it is done (or when the warming light goes on).",
        "On some cookers, you can turn off the warming option entirely, but in this case, you should still eat or refrigerate the rice before it cools to reduce the risk of food poisoning.",
        "If you are cooking other ingredients with the rice, those can burn during cooking.",
        "Next time, remove any sugary ingredients and cook separately, or any ingredients that you notice burning.",
        "Find a use for overcooked rice.",
        "Mushy, split grains can still be tasty if used in the right recipe.",
        "Consider these options to make the mushy texture less noticeable:\nFry it to remove that excess moisture\nTurn it into a sweet dessert\nAdd it to any soup, baby food, or homemade meatballs Adjust for altitude.",
        "If you live at 3,000 feet (910 m) or above, you may notice your rice ends up undercooked.",
        "If this happens, add an extra 1/4\u20131/2 cup of water per cup of rice (30\u201360 mL water per 240 mL rice).",
        "The lower air pressure at high altitude causes water to boil at a lower temperature, so the rice will take longer to cook.",
        "The more water you add to a rice cooker, the longer it will continue to cook.",
        "Consult the rice cooker instructions or contact the manufacturer if you cannot find the correct amount of additional water.",
        "The amount necessary varies with altitude.",
        "Deal with leftover water.",
        "If there is water left over in a rice cooker after it's finished cooking, the rice cooker model is likely defective and may need to be replaced.",
        "For the current batch of rice, drain the water and serve if the rice texture suits your preferences.",
        "Otherwise, turn the rice cooker back on until the water is used up.",
        "Finished."
