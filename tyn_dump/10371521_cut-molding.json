        "You can use any type of scrap board as the jig.",
        "Or, if you prefer not to make your own, you can purchase a jig from a hardware store.",
        "Clamp the jig in place with a C clamp.",
        "The clamp will keep the jig in position and ensure that your crown molding will be at an exact 45-degree angle for cutting.",
        "If you\u2019re cutting multiple pieces of crown molding, leave the jig clamped in place for each cut.",
        "Cut 1 crown molding board at a 90\u00b0 angle.",
        "The first piece of crown molding you cut will span the length of a wall and butt into both corners at a 90\u00b0 angle.",
        "Make sure that your miter saw is set to 90\u00b0 and will cut straight ahead, then make the cuts.",
        "Be careful not to bump the jig out of place when you\u2019re moving the crown molding board around.",
        "Cut inside corners by cutting a molding board at a 45\u00b0 angle.",
        "Set a second molding board in position against the saw and the jib.",
        "If you\u2019re going to position this board on the right side of the already-cut molding, set the saw 45\u00b0 to the left.",
        "If you\u2019re positioning this board to the left side of the already-cut molding, set the saw 45\u00b0 to the right.",
        "Once the board is in position, make the cut.",
        "When you position the 2 crown molding boards on the wall, the first board you cut will butt square into the corner.",
        "The second molding board will slip into place against the first, leaving no gap between the boards.",
        "Use a coping saw to trace the profile of the molding onto the edge of one piece after making your miter cut.",
        "This will help make your corners easier to install.",
        "Make outside corners by cutting 2 crown molding boards at 45\u00b0.",
        "For an outside corner, you\u2019ll only need 45-degree angle cuts.",
        "Rotate the saw to the left 45-degree mark and cut 1 board.",
        "Make sure the board is held tightly in place against the jib.",
        "Then, rotate the saw to the right 45-degree mark and cut your second board.",
        "Use a corner block to eliminate miter cuts and make the molding easier to install."
