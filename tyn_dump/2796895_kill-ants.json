                    "description": "Apply a fine layer of diatomaceous earth anywhere you notice ants gathering in. Common indoor areas are behind appliances, in cabinets, along the edges of carpets, and beneath rugs. Outdoor areas such as entrance ways, patios, window frames, and garden beds are also common. Only use food-grade diatomaceous earth. Some diatomaceous earth is used for cleaning swimming pools, but this variety usually contains pesticides and other chemicals that can be toxic to pets and small children if ingested. On the other hand, food-grade diatomaceous earth is non-toxic, and is safe to use throughout your home. Diatomaceous earth is a natural compound made from ground, fossilized shells of diatoms, a type of small marine organism. The powder is very abrasive and absorbent. Once an ant crosses over it, diatomaceous earth damages the waxy, protective coating on the ant's exterior, which means that the ant can't hold water. The ant does not die instantaneously, but it does eventually die from dehydration. The ants need to physically come into contact with diatomaceous earth for it to be effective.
