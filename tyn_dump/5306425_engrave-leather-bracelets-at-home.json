You should be able to find embossing stamps at any major craft store. This technique works best if you want to engrave letters onto a leather bracelet, especially since letter embossing stamps are so easy to find. You can use embossing stamps to spell out names, inspirational words, or short quotes and sayings. You could also opt for a design involving numbers, simple shapes, or simple images. Keep in mind that simplicity is key here. If you want to create a more elaborate design, you will need to use the freehand method. Before purchasing embossing stamps, make sure that the stamp face is no wider than the width of the leather bracelet you plan to use. Note that plain leather crafting bracelets are also available at most craft stores."
