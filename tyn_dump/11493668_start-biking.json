Road bikes are smaller than mountain bikes and have thinner wheels, which makes it easier to get them up to a higher speed. Road bikes are also lighter, which makes them easier to steer, carry, and maneuver. If you live in an apartment and will ever have to bring your bike inside, a road bike will be easier to store than a mountain bike. Used mountain and road bikes tend to be equally expensive. Expect to spend $100-300 on a used road bike. A new road bike will cost $400-$1000. Racing bicycles are a type of road bike. They tend to be extremely light and they\u2019re designed to go as fast as possible on paved surfaces. They tend to be quite expensive and fragile though, so don\u2019t pick a racing bike to start unless you\u2019re always going to be biking on smooth pavement with no obstacles."

Folding bikes can be easily disassembled to make them smaller, and they are extremely lightweight. However, they can\u2019t go very fast and they\u2019re awful at making it up hills. This makes folding bikes an excellent option if your only purpose is to make short trips in a congested area. Folding bikes are usually a little cheaper than a mountain or road bike.

Wear a good pair of tennis or running shoes when starting out. Tie your laces tight and double-knot your shoes to keep the laces from getting caught in the chain. If they do get caught regularly, you can tuck your laces into your shoes before you get on your bike. The other purpose of cycling shoes is to make your energy transfer more efficient as you ride. Your goal when starting out should be to maintain a good posture and get in the habit of biking, though. If you only care about speed, you\u2019re going to get frustrated when you start biking."

When riding your bike, keep the crest of the seat aligned with the center of your tailbone. Stay seated while pedaling and try to sit up straight while staying comfortable. The more relaxed you are while you ride, the more likely you are to bike for an extended period of time.Tip: There is an ideal stance for racing cycling which makes you more aerodynamic, but you shouldn\u2019t start out hunched over and leaning forward like a professional racer.

On a mountain bike, there are no drops, so place your hands where it\u2019s comfortable and easy to reach the brakes. When you do brake, use the back brake to make gradual stops. If you need to make an emergency stop, pull both brakes at the same time, pulling the front brake as light as possible to avoid flipping over."

                    "description": "When biking, your body is most efficient when it\u2019s pedaling a little over once per second. To develop a good pedaling pattern, turn the gears on the front of your bike until you can comfortably bike at a rate of 70-90 rotations per minute (rpm). This will require some trial and error, so switch your gears around as you start to ride to determine what works best for you. The gears control which track the chain hangs on, which changes the amount of resistance that you experience as you pedal. They\u2019re designed to make it easier to maintain your pace while biking up or down a hill. On flat surfaces, use them to adjust how fast you need to pedal. Almost all racing and mountain bikes have gears."

For a right turn, extend your left arm and bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle pointing up. To indicate that you are stopping or slowing down, extend your left arm with your elbow bent pointing down. This way, drivers will know when you are turning, moving, or stopping. Hand signals are made with the left arm because the right hand controls the back brake. This is the more important brake for cyclists, since the front brake should never be pulled on its own. If you are absolutely certain that you won\u2019t need to brake, feel free to indicate right turns by extending your right arm out."

Starting small will ensure that you aren\u2019t discouraged by not reaching your objective. It will also prevent injuries from the impact of long rides before your body is ready for it. If you\u2019re really new to biking, you can start even smaller. Choose a quiet, 4-5 block route with little-to-no traffic.

Bike jerseys are tight-fitting nylon or spandex shirts. They tend to be brightly colored so that you\u2019re highly visible when riding at night. They\u2019re also highly absorbent and will soak up sweat as you ride to keep you dry. Get a comfortable bike jersey that fits well to stay dray and visible. Again, specialized cycling clothing isn\u2019t required if you\u2019re a beginner. You can easily ride in a T-shirt, tank top, sweater, or jacket. If you\u2019re going to wear a regular shirt and bike at night, throw on a reflective vest so that drivers and pedestrians can easily see you. Wear athletic shoes before moving up to cycling shoes. Cycling shoes have ridges that hook into the grooves of some bike pedals. Since you\u2019re probably starting out with standard pedals, they aren\u2019t necessary. Wear a good pair of tennis or running shoes when starting out. Tie your laces tight and double-knot your shoes to keep the laces from getting caught in the chain. If they do get caught regularly, you can tuck your laces into your shoes before you get on your bike. The other purpose of cycling shoes is to make your energy transfer more efficient as you ride. Your goal when starting out should be to maintain a good posture and get in the habit of biking, though. If you only care about speed, you\u2019re going to get frustrated when you start biking. Get an air pump to avoid making frequent trips to the gas station. The air in bike tires naturally escapes over time, even if you don\u2019t have a punctured tire and keep your air valve capped tight. To avoid having to ride to the gas station every couple of weeks, get an air pump to refill your bike\u2019s tires. Get a manual pump if you want to save money. Buy an electric or mechanical air pump if you want to make filling your tires easier. Download a cycling app to track your distance and speed. Instead of spending money on a fancy pedometer or GPS system, download an app to track how far and fast you bike. Bike Computer, Strava, and MapMyRide are the most popular apps for bikers. They\u2019ll track your speed, route, and monitor how often you ride. This information is important when it comes to tracking your progress. Strava, Bike Computer, and MapMyRide are all free. You can download them from your phone\u2019s app store. You can connect a Bluetooth heart rate monitor to Strava and Bike Computer if you\u2019d like. Riding Your Bike Adjust the saddle so that your knee is slightly bent as you pedal. When your pedals are the closest to the ground, your knee should be slightly bent to avoid putting stress on your tendons and hamstrings. Adjust your saddle by lifting the latch and pulling it out to the unlocked position. Then, slide your seat up or down to adjust its height. Close the latch and press it tight to lock your seat in place. Develop a posture that\u2019s comfortable for you to maintain. There is no proper stance for typical cycling, but the straighter you can keep your spine, the better. When riding your bike, keep the crest of the seat aligned with the center of your tailbone. Stay seated while pedaling and try to sit up straight while staying comfortable. The more relaxed you are while you ride, the more likely you are to bike for an extended period of time.Tip: There is an ideal stance for racing cycling which makes you more aerodynamic, but you shouldn\u2019t start out hunched over and leaning forward like a professional racer. This will make it difficult to stay comfortable as you start riding. Ride with your hands in the drops of the handles to steer and brake. The drops of the handles refer to the loop where the handles dip down. Place both hands on the bottom of the handle to make steering and braking easier. On a mountain bike, there are no drops, so place your hands where it\u2019s comfortable and easy to reach the brakes. When you do brake, use the back brake to make gradual stops. If you need to make an emergency stop, pull both brakes at the same time, pulling the front brake as light as possible to avoid flipping over. Develop a pedaling cadence of 70-90 rpm to bike efficiently. When biking, your body is most efficient when it\u2019s pedaling a little over once per second. To develop a good pedaling pattern, turn the gears on the front of your bike until you can comfortably bike at a rate of 70-90 rotations per minute (rpm). This will require some trial and error, so switch your gears around as you start to ride to determine what works best for you. The gears control which track the chain hangs on, which changes the amount of resistance that you experience as you pedal. They\u2019re designed to make it easier to maintain your pace while biking up or down a hill. On flat surfaces, use them to adjust how fast you need to pedal. Almost all racing and mountain bikes have gears. Look down the road or trail as you\u2019re biking to avoid obstacles. To avoid running into potholes, rocks, or obstructions, look up while you\u2019re biking. Your first temptation may be to look down at your handlebar to focus on your body\u2019s motions, but this can be dangerous. Keep your eyes 90\u2013150 feet (27\u201346 m) down the road or trail to avoid running into something. It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s a little more comfortable for you to tilt your head down. Just make sure that you\u2019re looking up while you do this. Communicate with drivers by using hand signals on public roads. To avoid startling drivers, communicate when you plan to stop or turn. To indicate that you are turning left, extend your left arm straight away from your body. For a right turn, extend your left arm and bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle pointing up. To indicate that you are stopping or slowing down, extend your left arm with your elbow bent pointing down. This way, drivers will know when you are turning, moving, or stopping. Hand signals are made with the left arm because the right hand controls the back brake. This is the more important brake for cyclists, since the front brake should never be pulled on its own. If you are absolutely certain that you won\u2019t need to brake, feel free to indicate right turns by extending your right arm out. Staying Motivated to Ride Regularly Begin with a smaller goal of biking 1\u20135 mi (1.6\u20138.0 km) per ride. If you start out with a massive goal of biking 50 miles (80 km) a week, you\u2019ll struggle to reach your goal. Start out with a small, achievable with a goal of 1\u20135 miles (1.6\u20138.0 km) per ride. You can always work your way up to longer rides over time. Starting small will ensure that you aren\u2019t discouraged by not reaching your objective. It will also prevent injuries from the impact of long rides before your body is ready for it. If you\u2019re really new to biking, you can start even smaller. Choose a quiet, 4-5 block route with little-to-no traffic. Practice riding that route perfectly before moving up to a longer, more difficult ride. Track your distance during each session using a cycling app. Bike 2-4 times a week to give your body time to heal between rides. After your first ride, you\u2019re probably going to be quite sore. Overworking your body is a surefire way to discourage yourself from biking. Take days off between rides so that you\u2019re biking 2-4 times a week based on your level of comfort. If you\u2019re starting to bike so that you can get to work or school every day, start out by biking 2-3 times a week. Drive or take public transportation on the days that you\u2019re taking off. Work up to a full week over time. Make a habit of biking by tracking how often you ride. It\u2019s hard to start a new habit if you don\u2019t have accountability. In a journal, write down how often you ride each day. Note the distance that you biked as well. Review your results at the end of the week to determine whether or not you\u2019ve reached your goal. By tracking how often you actually bike, you\u2019ll know for sure whether you\u2019re getting in the swing of regularly biking. It will become easier to reach your goal over time as you get used to cycling and tracking your progress. Avoid routes that include hills or rough terrain until you\u2019re ready. To ensure that you don\u2019t harm yourself, stick with flat, simple routes to start off. Minimize the number of turns that you need to take and stay away from hills or rocky roads. It takes skill to navigate difficult routes; until you have some experience, you\u2019re better off playing it safe. Staying on flat roads with few obstructions allows you to get comfortable with the act of pedaling without needing to pay attention to your terrain. Find a biking group that takes scheduled rides together. If you find it hard to get in the habit of biking regularly, look into joining a cycling group. Cycling groups are a set of people that ride together on scheduled trips, and having a set of people to bike with will keep you motivated. Go to your local bike shop and ask around for a group to ride with. You can also search online for a beginner-level bike group that\u2019s open to new members.Tip: Don\u2019t jump into the deep end and join an intermediate or veteran group. You won\u2019t be able to keep up and you\u2019ll only get discouraged.",
