        "Place the polo on the towel, spreading it out as much as possible.",
        "Flatten the polo as much as you can against the towel.",
        "The towel will absorb moisture from any parts of the shirt it contacts.",
        "If you have the towel in a good location, the shirt should dry out relatively quickly so you can store it.",
        "A polo that has been partially dried in a drying machine may finish drying in about 15 to 25 minutes, although this varies depending on your environment.",
        "If the shirt seems to be drying slowly, try flipping it after 15 minutes.",
        "This encourages both sides of the shirt to dry at an even rate."
