Most soda siphon systems hold 1-2 quarts (0.95-1.90 L) of water. Buy whichever size suits you, depending on how much carbonated water you want to make at a time. Keep in mind that many of the CO2 chargers for these systems are single-use. Buy a pack of them big enough to last for a while. Modern soda siphons are the equivalent of seltzer bottles that have been around for about 100 years. Some antique shops or online auction sites may sell older seltzer bottles that still work. You will have to experiment with different sizes of CO2 canisters if you buy and old-style seltzer bottle to find one that fits."

Serve your newly-carbonated water in a glass to drink right away, or pour it into other bottles and store it in the fridge for later use. Make sure not to leave much air space if you are storing it in bottles to preserve the carbonation. You can flavor your carbonated water by adding flavoring syrups or juice. Start with 4 US tbsp (59 mL) of flavoring syrup or juice and add more to taste. Homemade carbonated water will last for about 2-3 days in the fridge before it starts to go flat."
