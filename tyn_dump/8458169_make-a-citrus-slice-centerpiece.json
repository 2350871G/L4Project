To begin making this arrangement, find two clear flower vases, making sure one of which is small enough to fit inside the other. Make sure that the vases are a similar shape but have different diameters. For instance, you can use two cube shaped vases, or two cylindrical vases. The vases should be of similar or equal height, but one vase's diameter should be about one inch (2.54 cm) smaller than the other vase's diameter so it can be comfortably placed within the larger vase."

Consider what kind of citrus fruit you will be using before choosing the colors of your flowers. For instance, if you are using orange slices, you may consider adding a few orange flowers to compliment the orange slices.
