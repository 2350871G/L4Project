Put the lid on and pulse the berries 3 to 4 times until they're cracked. If you don't have a food processor, you can crack the berries in a high-speed blender. Melt the butter in a pot and stir in the einkorn. Place 2 teaspoons (9 g) of butter into a pot on the stove. Turn the burner to medium and melt the butter.

Pulse the einkorn 4 to 5 times so the berries crack and make a little flour. Mince the garlic and put it in a pot with water and broth. Mince 1 clove of garlic and scoop it into a large pot on the stove. Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of vegetable broth and 1 cup (240 ml) of water into the pot. Simmer the liquid. Turn the burner to high so the liquid comes to a boil. Then turn the burner down to medium so the liquid bubbles gently. Keep simmering the liquid the entire time you're cooking the einkorn.
