                    "description": "Add 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of food grade citric acid, 3 tablespoons (23 g) of icing sugar, and 2 tablespoons (19 g) of flavored gelatin crystals in the flavor of your choice to a small bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together well, so they\u2019re fully blended. In some parts of the world, icing sugar is also known as powdered sugar. In some parts of the world, flavored gelatin is also known as jelly crystals. Food grade citric acid is usually sold in grocery and mass merchandise stores with the canning supplies. If you can\u2019t find it in a local store, you can also order it online. The citric acid helps give the sherbet powder a sour taste to contrast with the sweetness of the sugar. It also reacts with the baking soda for a fizzy sensation. If you want sherbet powder to be more fizzy, you can add in a little more citric acid."

        "Place the pan on the stove over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "You can usually find golden syrup in the baking aisle of the grocery store.",
        "However, in some parts of the world, you may find it in the international foods section.",
        "It\u2019s best to use a deep saucepan so you don\u2019t have to worry about the hot candy mixture boiling over as you cook it.",
        "Make sure to stir the mixture regularly as the mixture\u2019s heating so the sugar crystals don\u2019t stick to the pan.",
        "Bring the mixture to a boil.",
        "Once the sugar has dissolved, add a clip-on candy thermometer to the side of the pan.",
        "Continue to heat the mixture until it comes to a boil, which should take another 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "While you don\u2019t have to stir the mixture as frequently as when the sugar was dissolving, mix it periodically to ensure that it\u2019s heating evenly.",
        "Continue to heat the mixture until it reaches the hard-crack stage.",
        "After the mixture has come to boil, keep heating it over medium heat.",
        "Watch the candy thermometer, and cook it until it reaches 309 degrees Fahrenheit (154 degrees Celsius) or the hard-crack candy stage.",
        "The mixture will be extremely hot so be sure to handle it carefully.",
        "Remove the pan from the heat and add the extract and food coloring.",
        "As soon as the lollipop mixture reaches the proper temperature, take the pan off the heat.",

        "You can substitute another fruit flavoring or extract, such as raspberry flavoring or lime extract, for the lemon or orange.",
        "Pour the mixture into the mold and add lollipop sticks.",
        "Once the mixture is flavored and colored, carefully pour it into the greased lollipop mold.",
        "Place a lollipop stick in each compartment so the pops will have a handle.",
        "You can usually find lollipop sticks at the craft store.",
        "Be very careful when you\u2019re pouring the candy mixture.",
        "It will be extremely hot, so it may burn your skin if you accidentally get it on yourself.",
        "If you\u2019re not using a mold for the lollipops, allow the mixture to cool for approximately 5 minutes so it thickens and is easier to pour into a circle with a spoon.",
        "Allow the lollipops to cool completely before unmolding.",
        "After you\u2019ve filled the mold, allow the lollipops to sit for 10 to 15 until they harden and cool completely.",
        "When they\u2019re set, gently bend the mold to remove the lollipops.",
        "Give one a lick and dip it in your sherbet powder to enjoy.",
        "Store any unused lollipops in individual cellophane bags."
