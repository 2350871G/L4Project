If the hard drive is not readable, it\u2019s likely that the hard drive itself (and not your computer\u2019s software) failed. If this is the case, you will need professional assistance if you wish to continue the salvage. Be warned that this can be very expensive. Transfer the files to the working computer. Use File Explorer to transfer the old files to either the working computer or to the external hard drive by copying and pasting, clicking and dragging, etc. If you have a lot of large files (ex. songs, movies), note that the transfer could take many hours. Turn off and unplug the desktop to uninstall the hard drive (if desired). Since the hard drive is physically intact, it will probably work fine in the old laptop if you reinstall your operating system or replace the faulty parts. Accessing Your Old Files through Another Computer (Mac Only) Purchase a FireWire cable. They cost anywhere between $5 and $20. Borrow or purchase a working Mac. Make sure the Mac has enough space to accommodate the files you want to recover from the dead laptop. Note: You can connect a second external hard drive up to the working Mac and simply use the Mac to transfer files from the old hard drive to the new one. Connect the dead Mac to the working Mac using the FireWire cable. Make sure that the working Mac is turned off when you do this. Boot up the working mac in Target Disk Mode. If you are using an older version of MacOS, simply boot up the working Mac and press T as it boots up. Otherwise, use the following steps to boot into Target Disk Mode in MacOS 10.4 or newer. Turn on your computer as normal. Click the Apple icon in the menu bar at the top of the screen. Click System Preferences\n\nClick Startup Disk\n\nClick Target Disk Mode. Reboot your computer to start it in Target Disk Mode. Find and open the dead computer\u2019s hard drive on your Mac\u2019s desktop. If the targeted drive does not appear on the desktop, the damage to your old computer is likely physical, meaning you will need professional assistance to finish the salvage. Be warned that this can be very expensive. Transfer your old files. Transfer them to either the working Mac or to the external hard drive by copying and pasting, or clicking and dragging. If you have a lot of large files (ex. songs, movies), note that the transfer could take many hours. When you\u2019re done, close the window to your hard drive. The good news is that the dead computer is still physically intact and will probably work fine if you reinstall your operating system or replacing the faulty parts. Right-click the targeted drive and select Eject. You can now detach the dead computer.",
