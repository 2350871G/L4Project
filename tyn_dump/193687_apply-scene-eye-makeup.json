Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, and moisturize your skin so that your make up won\u2019t flake. Apply a foundation primer, then put your foundation on all over your face, (or just on troubled skin areas), bringing it slightly down to your neck. For this look, a matte, full coverage foundation works best. It will make your finished look more stark, flawless, and dramatic. Apply foundation to your preference. If you\u2019re having trouble getting an even look, try using a Beauty Blender or a foundation brush to blend it into your skin."

Use an eyeliner or eyebrow pencil and lightly trace the shape you want your brows to take. Comb your brow hairs straight up with a spoolie brush. Trim them with small nail scissors to fit the shape you have drawn. Then, pluck the stray hairs that fall outside your brow outline.
