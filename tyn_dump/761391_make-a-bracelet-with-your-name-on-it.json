For this type of bracelet, you will need seven strings in the color you want your letters to be, and one string only in the color you want your background to be. Each string should be about 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Knot your threads together at the top of the bundle. Make sure the tops of each of your threads are aligned with each other, so no string will end up seeming longer than the other as you make your bracelet. Position the background color string at the far left edge of the bundle, then tie all the strings together, leaving about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of excess string sticking out of the top of the bundle. Tape your bundle of strings to your work surface. Choose a flat work surface, such as a table or a clipboard. Place a sturdy piece of tape above the knot you just made in your bundle of threads to secure it to your chosen surface. Before you tape the strings down, make sure the background color string is still positioned at the far left of the bundle. Make a left knot with your background color string. To make your first knot, loop your background color string clockwise around the string directly to its right (which should be your letter color). Then, loop the background color string clockwise around the letter color string again, and then, from behind, push the end of your background color string through the loop you create. Pull tight to finish. Knot an initial row of your background color. After you've made your first left knot, continue on to the next string, and tie a left knot onto that string with the same piece of background thread you used to tie your first knot. Repeat across all seven letter color threads, traveling to the right. Consult a letter pattern to learn how to tie your next row. Once you've finished your first row, find the first letter of the name you want to weave on a sheet of letter patterns (a good example of which can be found three-quarters of the way down this webpage: http://friendship-bracelets.net/tutorial.php?id=2.) Then, look carefully at the leftmost grid column of your chosen letter. Note how many boxes are empty and how many are filled in, as well as what order they occur in. Each box corresponds to the type of knot you will make on one of your 8 strands of thread. If you're knotting across the bracelet to your left, the top box is represents the string that's directly adjacent to the string that you're weaving with when you start a row. If you're knotting across the bracelet to your right, the bottom box represents the string that's directly adjacent to your starting string. Tie the first knot of your first letter row using a right knot. The first box in each column will be empty, whether it's the top or bottom box. An empty box indicates that you should tie a right knot with your background color on that particular letter string. So, tie a right knot with your background string on the letter color string directly to its left to start your first row. To tie a right knot, follow the same procedure as a left knot, but start by looping the background color string around the letter color string directly to its left, and loop counterclockwise instead of clockwise. Tie the remaining knots of your row according to your letter pattern. For the next six threads, you will make one of two types of knots. If the box is empty, tie a right knot, as described above. If the box is filled, it indicates that you should tie a left downward knot onto the background string with the adjacent letter string. To tie a left downward knot, position the background string horizontally underneath the letter string you'll be tying with. Then, loop your letter string under and over the horizontal string from the front. Tuck the end of the letter string through the resulting loop, but make sure you're tucking it through the part of the loop that's to the left of the vertical part of the letter string. Pull tight to complete the knot. Start a new row by tying knots in the opposite direction. When you've completed the first row of your bracelet (which is also the first column of your first letter), you'll be back at the left edge of your bracelet. Now, instead of tying right knots, go back to tying left knots with your background thread when you see an empty box, and tie right downward knots onto your background thread with the adjacent letter thread when you see a filled box. To tie a right downward knot, follow the same procedure as the left downward knot, but instead tuck the end of your letter string through the part of the loop that's to the right of the vertical part of the letter string. Knot a row of your background color when you finish a letter. When you finish each letter, knot a row of your background color only by tying right or left knots with your background color string, depending on which direction you're traveling in. This will create a space between each letter. Proceed, switching directions for each completed row, until your last letter is done. As you create your bracelet, remember to tie left knots and right downward knots when knotting from the left, and to tie right knots and left downward knots when knotting from the right. Knot one more background color row and tie your bracelet off. When your name has been spelled out, knot one more row with your background color thread. When this row is complete, tie off your bracelet with a simple knot. Trim the excess, and it'll be ready to wear. Making a Name Bracelet with Letter Beads Find a bead for each letter of your name. Open your bag of alphabet beads and pour them into a bowl. Find each letter of your name, and spell it out on a flat work surface. If you're planning to make multiple bracelets, you may want to purchase several bags of letter beads to ensure that you don't run out of common letters. Measure a length of elastic string that will fit around your wrist. Pull some elastic string from your spool, bundle, or bunch. Then, make a circle around your wrist, or visualize making a circle around the wrist of the person you're making the bracelet for. You should aim to cut a length of string that fits comfortably around whichever wrist you have in mind, with a couple inches of extra length so you can tie a knot when it's complete. Since elastic string is stretchy, you don't need to worry about making your measurements exact. However, it's usually better to have more string than less, because you can always trim off the excess when your project is complete. Tape the left end of your bracelet down on your work surface. Once you've cut your length of elastic string, lay it horizontally on your flat work surface. Place a piece of tape about two or three inches from the left end of the string. This will keep the string securely in one place, making it easier to thread beads onto it. Begin stringing colorful beads onto your bracelet. Empty out your bag(s) of colorful beads \u2013 such as pony beads, colored wooden beads, or gemstone beads \u2013 into a large bowl. Select the colors you prefer, then begin stringing beads onto your bracelet in whatever order you like. Alternate beads of different shapes or repeat a pattern of different-colored beads to create an interesting design. String your alphabet beads onto the bracelet. Once you've strung several colorful beads onto your bracelet, thread your alphabet beads onto the elastic from left to right, in the same order in which you initially laid them down on the table. If your name is longer, you'll have to string fewer colorful beads before you begin adding your alphabet beads. This will ensure that there will be enough room on your bracelet to spell out your entire name, and then add more colorful beads at the end. If you wish, place a colorful bead between each letter of your name and the next. String more colored beads onto your bracelet. When you're finished spelling out your name, string more colored beads onto the end of your bracelet. Make sure to stop about two or three inches short of the end of the string so you'll have enough left to tie your bracelet around your wrist (or your friend's). Repeat the pattern of colors and shapes you made with your first section of colored beads to create a cool, symmetrical look. Tie off your bracelet and trim the excess elastic string. When you've finished stringing all your beads, remove the tape from the left end of your bracelet and tie the loose ends  together with two or three tight knots. Trim so there's just a little bit of excess string extending from the knot. Apply glue to your knot if you want to create a very secure closure. To make sure your beaded name bracelet lasts as long as possible, apply some beading adhesive or super glue to your knot. Pull the knot away from your beads, then place a small dot of glue on the knot. Continue keeping the knot pulled away from the beads until the glue is dry (for about 1-2 minutes.)

        "Tape the left end of your bracelet down on your work surface.",
        "Once you've cut your length of elastic string, lay it horizontally on your flat work surface.",
        "Place a piece of tape about two or three inches from the left end of the string.",
        "This will keep the string securely in one place, making it easier to thread beads onto it.",
        "Begin stringing colorful beads onto your bracelet.",
        "Empty out your bag(s) of colorful beads \u2013 such as pony beads, colored wooden beads, or gemstone beads \u2013 into a large bowl.",
        "Select the colors you prefer, then begin stringing beads onto your bracelet in whatever order you like.",
        "Alternate beads of different shapes or repeat a pattern of different-colored beads to create an interesting design.",
        "String your alphabet beads onto the bracelet.",
        "Once you've strung several colorful beads onto your bracelet, thread your alphabet beads onto the elastic from left to right, in the same order in which you initially laid them down on the table.",
        "If your name is longer, you'll have to string fewer colorful beads before you begin adding your alphabet beads.",
        "This will ensure that there will be enough room on your bracelet to spell out your entire name, and then add more colorful beads at the end.",
        "If you wish, place a colorful bead between each letter of your name and the next.",
        "String more colored beads onto your bracelet.",
        "When you're finished spelling out your name, string more colored beads onto the end of your bracelet.",
        "Make sure to stop about two or three inches short of the end of the string so you'll have enough left to tie your bracelet around your wrist (or your friend's).",
        "Repeat the pattern of colors and shapes you made with your first section of colored beads to create a cool, symmetrical look.",
        "Tie off your bracelet and trim the excess elastic string.",
        "When you've finished stringing all your beads, remove the tape from the left end of your bracelet and tie the loose ends  together with two or three tight knots.",
        "Trim so there's just a little bit of excess string extending from the knot.",
        "Apply glue to your knot if you want to create a very secure closure.",
        "To make sure your beaded name bracelet lasts as long as possible, apply some beading adhesive or super glue to your knot.",
        "Pull the knot away from your beads, then place a small dot of glue on the knot.",
        "Continue keeping the knot pulled away from the beads until the glue is dry (for about 1-2 minutes.)",
        "Only adults should use super glue or other powerful adhesives."
