    "text": " Obtaining Seeds Obtain fresh seed pods from an active plant. Fresh seeds are likely to produce, but dried seeds have a low success rate. Alternatively, you can obtain fresh seeds from a garden supply store or other reputable dealers. When seed pods appear on an adult plant, wrap the pods with wire or twine. If the seed pods open, the seeds will disperse, and you will not be able to use them to grow a new plant. Remove the pods from the plant once they mature. They must be allowed to mature before removal; otherwise, the seeds may not be developed enough to grow. When the seed pods try to open, they are mature and ready for removal. Clip them off with a sharp knife or pair of scissors. Set the seed pods out on a flat surface. Allow them to dry. Remove the ties from the pod and gently crack it open with your thumbnail. Each pod should contain multiple \"feathery\" seeds. Starting Seeds Prepare a plastic seedling tray or small pots. If the containers you use do not have drainage holes, you should poke one hole into the bottom of the container before proceeding. In the case of plastic seedling trays, this can be done by poking the tip of a pen or large needle into the bottom of each compartment. The hole does not need to be large.
