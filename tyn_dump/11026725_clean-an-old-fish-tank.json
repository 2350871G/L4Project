Make sure that you use a bucket that is large enough to hold all the old water in your tank. You want to drain it completely. For example, if your fish tank holds 4 gallons of water, you will likely want to use at least a 5-gallon bucket to avoid spillover. If the fish tank is very large, you may need to use a siphon hose to drain the water into a bucket or sink."
