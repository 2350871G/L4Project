Take your piece of paper. Cut or tear the piece of paper into smaller pieces with your hands, scissors, ruler, etc. The small papers should be roughly near 7 cm by 1 cm. Scrunch up the small pieces of paper into a good-sized, tight and firm paper ball. This will be called a mini-paper bullet. Make a few more bullets to add to your ammo stock. For a more advanced paper bullet, you could also try making paper hornets. Shooting: Basic Method 1 Take the Rubber band. Wrap it around your thumb and index finger. Make sure to put the rubber band on your default hand (hand that you usually use). Grab a bullet and move it in between the rubber band. Pinch it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand. Don't let go of the bullet. Pull the bullet towards you. If you are pulling the closest band towards you, you are doing it correctly. Draw, aim and let it go.  Shooting: Basic Method 2 Repeat the setup for the first method without fitting the bullet.  Pinch and place the bullet outside of the rubber band away from you.

Shooting: Full Power Repeat the setup as before without fitting the bullet.  Pinch and place the bullet in the same way as the second method.  Pull the bullet towards you. This time, pull both bands.

Although it is easy to do practically, describing it in words is a different matter. Hold the band closest to you. Pull it under the band farthest from you. Move it to the base of your middle finger without any twisting. Hold the bullet by pinching it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand. Place the bullet in front of the higher rubber band.  Pull back the rubber band and twist the band.  Pull back, sight, fire.  Shooting: Advanced Method 2 Setup the rubber like usually.
