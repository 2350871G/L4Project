Cabinets are also usually 34.5\" tall, allowing for a 36\" overall height once the countertop material is added. To calculate the size of wall (or upper) cabinets, add 18-20\" to the counter height. Subtract this from the overall height of your ceiling and you will have the range you can work in for cabinet size. Standard wall cabinet depth is 12-14\". The lower cabinet width will be somewhere between 12-60\" in 3\" increments. 15\", 18\", 21\", and 24\" are the most common sizes. Don't forget to plan your cabinet size around the cabinet doors that are available to you (unless you plan to make your own)!"

Just get something sturdy and affordable! The side panels will be 34.5\" high and 24\" wide. Add a toe-kick by clamping the two side panels together and then, using a jigsaw, cut a 3x5.5\" notch into one corner of the panels. This is the bottom front corner. Unclamp the side pieces after they are cut. Adjust the measurements for a wall cabinet and skip the toe-tick. No toes up there, we hope!"
