        "No stirring is needed during this time.",
        "Remove the filter and enjoy.",
        "Tug on the string to pull the filter bundle out.",
        "Add cream and sugar as desired, and serve.",
        "Give the bundle a slight squeeze with a spoon against the side of the cup to force out extra liquid.",
        "Since the liquid inside the bundle had prolonged contact with the grounds, it will make the coffee stronger if you squeeze it back into the mug.",
        "Using a Saucepan Place the coffee grounds and water in a small saucepan.",
        "Give the mixture a slight stir to help combine them.",
        "Use about 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of coffee grounds per 1 cup (250 mL) of water you add.",
        "Heat to a boil.",
        "Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high.",
        "Allow the water to reach a boil.",
        "Stir the coffee occasionally as it comes to a boil.",
        "Let boil for 2 minutes.",
        "Start the timer after the water reaches a full boil.",
        "Let the coffee boil for a full two minutes, uncovered, before removing the saucepan from the heat.",
        "As soon as you turn off the heat, the grounds should sink to the bottom of the saucepan.",
        "Pour the coffee into your cup.",
        "If you pour slowly and carefully, the coffee grounds should remain at the bottom of the saucepan, making a strainer unnecessary.",
        "That said, you can still pour the coffee through a strainer if you have one.",
        "Doing so will prevent any stray grounds from entering your mug as you pour the coffee.",
        "Using a French Press Boil the water.",
        "Consider using a kettle, saucepan, microwave, or electric hot pot, depending on which of these resources are available to you.",
        "A kettle is an ideal option, but saucepans work in a very similar way.",
        "Fill the kettle or saucepan with enough water for your batch of coffee.",
        "Place it on the stove and heat, over medium to high heat, until the water begins to simmer or boil.",
        "Microwave water by placing it in a microwave-safe dish.",
        "Insert a wooden chopstick or other non-metallic utensil to prevent the water from super-heating and microwave in short intervals, no greater than 2 minutes each, until the water is hot enough.",
        "You can heat water in an electric hot pot by simply adding enough water to the device, plugging it in, and setting the dial to medium or high heat.",
        "Place the grounds in your French press.",
        "Add 1 Tbsp (15 mL) of coffee grounds to your press per 4 oz (125 mL) of water.",
        "A coffee aficionado would insist on using freshly ground coffee, but you could also use pre-ground coffee.",
        "Pour the water into your French press.",
        "Pour the water directly over the grounds in your press, making sure that all the grounds are saturated.",
        "Change where the water falls to ensure the grounds are evenly saturated.",
        "As you pour, you should notice a small \"bloom\" forming at the surface of the coffee slurry.",
        "Use a chopstick to stir the slurry and bring out the bloom further.",
        "Steep.",
        "Place the filter assembly on the top of the press and let the coffee steep for a few minutes.",
        "For a small press pot, 2 to 3 minutes should be enough time.",
        "A larger press pot may need to steep for a full 4 minutes.",
        "Plunge the filter.",
        "Grasp the plunger stick on the top of the plunger assembly and press down.",
        "Press the plunger down evenly and in a steady manner.",
        "If the plunger becomes crooked, the grounds could escape into the upper portion of the press.",
        "Pour the coffee.",
        "Pour the directly from the press pot and into your coffee cups.",
        "Hold the lid to prevent it from sliding around or popping off as you pour.",
        "Using Instant Coffee Heat the water.",
        "Without a coffee maker, water can be boiled using a tea kettle, saucepan, electric hot pot, or microwave oven.",
        "To boil water in a kettle or saucepan, fill the cookware with enough water for your coffee and place it on the stove.",
        "Set the eye for medium to high heat and remove once the water begins to simmer or boil.",
        "Boil water in the microwave by pouring it into a microwave-safe cup and inserting a wooden chopstick or other non-metallic utensil inside.",
        "Heat for 1 to 2 minute intervals until the water begins to bubble.",
        "Heat your water using an electric hot put by filling the device with water and plugging it in to an electric outlet.",
        "Set the dial to a medium or high setting and heat until the water is ready.",
        "Measure out the instant coffee.",
        "Each brand of instant coffee varies, but you should usually use between 1 and 2 tsp (5 and 10 mL) of instant coffee granules per 6 oz (180 mL) of water.",
        "Place the instant coffee granules directly in your coffee mug.",
        "Pour in the water and stir.",
        "Pour the hot water over the coffee granules.",
        "Stir well to mix, then add sugar and cream as desired.",
        "Finished."
