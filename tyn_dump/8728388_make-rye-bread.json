        "Use your hands to shape the dough into a smooth ball.",
        "You can turn and tuck the dough until you've got a smooth ball with a small seam underneath.",
        "Since you won't bake this bread in a pan, it's important to get the dough into a tight free form ball.",
        "Prove the dough for at least eight hours.",
        "Sprinkle the inside of a large, round bowl with rye flour and set the ball of dough into it.",
        "If the ball has a seam, you should place that on the bottom of the bowl.",
        "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and set the dough in a warm place.",
        "Prove the dough for at least eight hours or overnight.",
        "Rye flour takes much longer to prove than wheat flour, but the dough should double in volume.",
        "Prepare the oven and a steaming pan.",
        "About 30 minutes before your dough has finished proving, turn on the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).",
        "Set a roasting pan in the bottom of the oven while the oven preheats.",
        "Once it gets hot, carefully pour enough boiling water to fill the pan half full.",
        "The roasting pan full of water will make steam in the oven.",
        "This gives your rye bread a better crust than if you baked it in a dry oven.",
        "Set the dough on a sheet and slash the top.",
        "Lay a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat on a baking sheet.",
        "Carefully turn the risen dough out of the bowl and onto the baking sheet.",
        "Use a sharp knife to make three deep slashes on top of the dough.",
        "You can do straight slashes or crosshatches.",
        "The slashes help steam escape from the dough as it bakes.",
        "Bake the dark rye bread.",
        "Put the bread in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.",
        "Since you won't be able to tell whether the bread is finished baking based on the color, you'll need to take it out of the oven.",
        "Turn the bread over and tap the bottom.",
        "Once the bread is cooked, it will sound hollow.",
        "If it doesn't, return it to the oven for a few more minutes.",
        "Cool the bread completely before you slice it."
