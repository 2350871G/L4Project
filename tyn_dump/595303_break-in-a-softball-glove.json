                    "description": "The most surefire way to break in a stiff new softball glove is to use it to play catch frequently. This way, you\u2019re using it for what it was designed for, and won\u2019t have to worry about damaging the glove\u2019s materials using unorthodox methods. The downside of simply playing catch to break in your glove is that it can take many hours of catching to soften the glove up enough. When catching a softball with a new glove, concentrate on enveloping and squeezing the ball with the area around the thumb and forefingers to form what is known as a \u201cpocket.\u201d This will give the glove a natural contour the size and shape of a softball and make catching easier as a result."
