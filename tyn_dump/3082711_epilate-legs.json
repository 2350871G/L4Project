Others prefer to epilate dry, since this allows the epilator to get a firm grasp on the hairs and do its work more effectively. If this is your first time, you might want to epilate wet to keep your skin moist and warm the whole time. Try epilating in a shallow warm bath (just make sure you don't drop your epilator!). Use shower gel on your legs to help the epilator glide more easily. If you want to do it dry, make sure your skin is completely dry. The drier your hairs, the better the epilator will be able to grip them; damp hairs will get slippery and sticky, making the process harder. After exfoliating, dry your legs and sprinkle them with baby powder before you begin."
