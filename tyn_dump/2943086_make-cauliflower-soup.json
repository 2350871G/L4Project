        "Stir them occasionally with a rubber spatula so that they don't brown.",
        "Add the cauliflower and the chicken stock.",
        "If you have not yet done so, rinse the cauliflower, then cup off the stem and leaves.",
        "Cut it into florets, then add it to the saucepan along with the chicken stock.",
        "If you are vegetarian, or simply don't like chicken, you can use vegetable stock instead.",
        "If you cannot find any liquid chicken stock, you can make own by dissolving a bouillon cube or powder in 4 cups (950 milliliters) of hot water.",
        "How much bouillon you use depends on the brand that you are using; each brand requires different ratios of bouillon to water, so be sure to read the package.",
        "Simmer the mixture, covered, for about 15 minutes.",
        "Reduce the heat to low, and let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes.",
        "You are ready for the next step when the cauliflower turns soft and starts to fall apart.",
        "Take the saucepan off the burner, then pur\u00e9e the mixture.",
        "You can do this using a hand-held immersion blender, or you can do it in two batches in a blender or food processor.",
        "If you are using a blender, be sure to open the lid a crack after blending to release any built-up pressure.",
        "Stir in the Parmesan cheese.",
        "If you used a blender or food processor to pur\u00e9e your soup, pour it back into the saucepan first.",
        "Next, add the Parmesan cheese, and stir until it melts and everything is smooth.",
        "Season the soup, if needed, then serve it warm.",
        "Give the soup a taste, then add as much salt and pepper as you'd like.",
        "Serve the soup while it is still hot."
