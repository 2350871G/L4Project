If the replacement plug you\u2019re using has a hinge instead of a separate cover, you may skip this step. Secure the wire with ribbed insulation to the plug\u2019s silver neutral screw.

Put the wire underneath the brass screw on the side of the replacement plug so it wraps around the screw clockwise. Tighten the screw with your screwdriver so the wire has a firm connection. The brass screw connects to the smaller prong, which is the \u201chot\u201d or positive side. If your lamp has 3 wires, then use the wire that has red or black insulation. Attach the ground wire to the green screw, if your lamp has one. Look for the green wire from the lamp cord and bend a small hook shape on the exposed end.
