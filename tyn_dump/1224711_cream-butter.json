                    "description": "Take the butter out of the fridge about 10 minutes before you intend to work with it, and cut it into 1/4 in (6.45 mm) pieces. Cold butter does not blend well when mixed and will leave chunks of butter throughout the finished product. While \"room temperature\" is standard advice, slightly cooler than room temperature is actually better. Once the butter reaches about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), it's too warm to retain much air, which can result in denser baked goods. For best results, test the temperature using a digital thermometer. If you don't have one, you can test the butter by giving it a poke with your fingers; if the butter is soft as a ripe peach and your fingers easily leave an indentation, it's ready to use. However, if the butter is squishy and shiny it has probably started to melt, which is not ideal for creaming. Place the butter back in the fridge for 5 to 10 minutes until it firms up a little."
