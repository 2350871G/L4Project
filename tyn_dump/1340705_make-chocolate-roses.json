Remove and stir with a heatproof spatula until melted pieces blend with any chunks still left. If needed, return to microwave for an additional 30 seconds. Repeat as needed only until chocolate is melted. If you melt the chocolate too much it will harden faster and not be as easy to use. Add 1/3 cup (78 ml) of corn syrup to chocolate and blend well. Scrape any remaining syrup from the measuring cup and around the edges of the bowl as you mix the ingredients. Set a 1 foot (30.5 cm) piece of plastic wrap on the counter. Pour mixture onto one end of the wrap. Fold the other ends in to enclose chocolate. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove from the refrigerator and touch to test hardness. The chocolate should feel like dough or pliable clay, soft to the touch but will still hold its shape. Tear off 1 foot (30.5 cm) of wax paper and set it on the counter. Also place a cookie sheet on the counter with another piece of wax paper on top. Knead chocolate clay until it is soft and easy to mold. Try to use mostly the tips of your fingers since the palms of your hands are the warmest part and the heat can make the clay too soft. Separate chocolate into small balls roughly 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter. Place on 1 end of the wax covered cookie sheet. Keep 1 ball on the wax paper on the counter. Using a butter knife, flatten the clay and spread it out to desired size. The middle of the chocolate clay strip and 1 edge should be thicker than the rest. Remove the clay from the paper with the edge of the knife so that you have a flat piece of chocolate. Curl the chocolate so that it tapers on the top. This should resemble the bud in the center of a rose. Gently press back a little of the top of the clay petal. Repeat molding process and place second piece of chocolate clay around the bud. Press back the top edges of the petal. Continue the process by wrapping the next piece of chocolate on the opposite side of the bud. Proceed to circle around the other petals with 10 more sections of the chocolate clay. Press back top edges of the petals until the clay resembles a chocolate rose in full bloom. Pinch off any excess clay from the bottom of the chocolate roses. This excess can be added back to the molding clay to make more petals. Set finished roses on the waxed cookie sheet to harden.
