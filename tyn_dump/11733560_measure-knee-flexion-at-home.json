Position the other arm of the goniometer with the lateral malleolus, which is the protrusion on the outside of your ankle.You may find it easier to have a friend do this for you. If you\u2019re using a phone app, check the app\u2019s instructions for how to use it first. Phone apps work by identifying the angle of your phone when held against your thigh and then against your calf, so you\u2019ll be instructed to position it along your thigh first and then along your calf.
