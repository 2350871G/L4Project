Often, the culprit is where you've dragged gasoline in on your shoes or where gas has spilled out of a can in the back. Use your nose to sniff out the likely source of the smell. Soak up any gasoline. If the spill is new, press a cloth on the spill to get up as much gasoline as you can. It's best to use old rags, as you likely won't want to keep them once you're done. Let the gasoline evaporate. Once you've soaked up as much as you can, let the sun do the rest. Leave the car open in a sunny spot, so it will dry out the spot and draw the gasoline into the air. Try to leave it open for at least 4 to 5 hours. Cleaning the Spill Make a cleaning solution. Create a simple solution of carpet shampoo and water. Use about 3 cups (720 milliliters) of tap water to 1/2 a cup (120 milliliters) of shampoo. Stir it gently until it is well combined. Another option is mixing together vinegar, baking soda, and water in equal parts. You can also dissolve a bit of dishwashing soap in water, and apply that instead. Scrub the mixture in. Using a nylon brush or a rag, apply the mixture to the spill. Scrub it in, applying more solution as you need it. Make sure to use a rag or brush that you don't mind throwing out. Dab the solution up. Once the stain seems to have lifted, dab at the solution with old rags. Make sure you are using different rags in each step. Get up as much as you can with the rag, then let it air dry in the sun. Eliminating the Smell Rub in some coffee grounds. Some people have good luck using coffee grounds to eliminate gas smells. All you do is rub grounds into the affected area. After a week or so, vacuum up the coffee, and the smell should be lessened. Some experts recommend trying a short coffee treatment before you shampoo the area. Pour on the baking soda. Some people cover up the smell by dousing it in dry baking soda.
