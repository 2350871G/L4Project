The main shut off valve is most likely located inside near your water meter. Use a screwdriver to remove the faucet\u2019s indicator button and handle. With a flathead screwdriver, pop off the indicator or index button, which is typically located on the top of the handle. When you take this off, you should see the head of a screw at the center of the handle. Unscrew this screw with your screwdriver, pull off the handle, and set everything aside.

The stem of the faucet is a cylindrical piece that makes up the moving parts on the inside, while the broach is the gear-shaped piece of metal that sits at the top of your faucet\u2019s stem and allows the faucet valve to open and close. Darken 1 spline with a marker. The splines are the pointed ridges that go all the way around the outside of the broach. Use a permanent marker to darken any 1 of the splines so that you can effectively count how many there are. Count all the way around until you end up at the marked spline. Use the marked spline as a starting point. Count each spline and stop when you\u2019ve gotten back to the marked spline. This is the number of splines your broach has. Identifying by Shape and Size Identify Delta faucets by their \" D \"shaped broach. Observing this part of your faucet is often a good way to at least narrow down the brand possibilities, as different companies have different broach sizes and shapes. If the broach is \" D \" shaped, you may have a Delta faucet on your hands. Other brands that have \" D \" shaped brooches include Moen and Mixet.

These bulges are located near where the handle meets the stem. If you notice some excess metal sticking out from your faucet in this area, it may be a T&S faucet.
