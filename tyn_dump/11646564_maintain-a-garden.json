If your plants bud in the early spring, then trim their branches right after they bloom so they have time to recover. Use hand pruners to trim up to a third of the plant\u2019s growth. Make your cuts at a 45-degree angle so water runs off them and reduces the risk of rot. Be sure to reach into the middle of the plants to remove some of the interior branches to allow air flow through the plant. If you notice branches or leaves shriveling or yellowing from heat during the summer, prune them so they don\u2019t kill the rest of the plant. Deadhead dying flowers in the summer to help promote future growth. Wait until the blooms in your garden start shriveling up, or when they turn yellow or brown. Pinch the bases of the flowers and carefully twist them to pull them off of the plant. If you have difficulty removing the blooms by hand, cut the flowers at the base with a pair of hand pruners. If you leave dead flowers on your plants, they may not bloom fully during the next growing season. If you have perennial plants, cut them to a height of 8\u201310 inches (20\u201325 cm) at the end of the growing season, or else they may not grow as well in the next year. Rake debris out from the garden beds in the fall. Remove any dead plant matter that\u2019s fallen into the soil since it could easily contain diseases or cause weeds to sprout in the area. Drag your rake gently over the soil and collect any scraps or debris into a pile. Throw everything you rake out into a trash can so it doesn\u2019t spread anywhere else in your yard. Cleaning up debris in the fall ensures that bacteria don\u2019t absorb into the soil before the next growing season. You don\u2019t have to remove plants that have died or withered naturally after the growing season since they can add nutrients back into your garden. Caring for a Water Garden Cut plants back once or twice during the growing season. Use a pair of hand pruners to cut off any growths that look yellow, brown, or diseased. If the plant looks healthy, then opt for cutting back the oldest stems or branches to encourage new growth. Aim to trim about a third of the plant\u2019s growth in the beginning and near the end of the main growing season. If you need to reach plants in the middle of the water garden\u2019s pond, walk through it with wading boots. Go slowly so you don\u2019t slip or fall. Some plants, such as water hyacinth, may need more frequent trimming since they are more invasive. Remove dead leaves or plants as soon as possible. Check your water garden daily to make sure there isn\u2019t any foreign debris that fell into the pond since it could cause algae to grow. Pick out floating debris with a pond skimming net and throw it away in your trash. If you have dying plants, trim off any stems or leaves with your pruners before they fall into the water. If you want to prevent debris from falling in the water, stretch a piece of mesh netting over the water to catch it. Clear and rinse the filter weekly. Look for the pump along the edge of your water garden and remove the lid to access the filter. Take out any leaves or debris that are stuck inside the filter and throw them away so water can flow easily through it. Then pull the filter straight out and spray it with your garden hose to clean off anything that\u2019s stuck to it. If the debris doesn\u2019t rinse off of the filter, buy a replacement from a gardening store or online. Refill the water garden with your garden hose once per week. Water will naturally evaporate from your pond, so place your garden hose in the garden. While the amount of water you need to refill the pond varies on the weather, try to add about 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) each week. Avoid replacing all of the water at once in your garden since you could remove beneficial bacteria or stress your plants. Some water gardens automatically refill depending on the type of pump or system you have.Tip: Mark the regular water level on the pond\u2019s liner or on a rock around the edge so you know how much you need to fill it each week. Place fertilizer tabs in the aquatic soil to stimulate plant growth. Fertilize your plants at the beginning of the growing season so your plants get the nutrients they need. Reach into the water and push 1\u20132 fertilizer tabs per plant into soil underwater and cover them. Over 3\u20134 days, the fertilizer will dissipate in the soil and water and keep your plants healthy. You can buy fertilizer tabs from your local gardening store or online. Avoid using standard garden fertilizer since it could cause algae to grow on the surface. Add beneficial bacteria to help maintain the natural ecosystem. Put the bacteria in your pond at the beginning of the growing season and follow up with more every 5\u20136 weeks. Follow the directions on the package and add enough beneficial bacteria based on the size of your pond. As the bacteria grow in your pond, it will eliminate algae and provide nutrients for your plants. You can buy beneficial bacteria for ponds online or at specialty gardening stores. It can take around 4 weeks for the bacteria to grow, so your pond may look green or algae-filled at the beginning of the growing season. Feed fish in your water garden daily. Get premium fish food for the species you have in your pond and toss a handful into your pond each day. Make sure you don\u2019t overfeed the fish, or else they may not eat algae throughout the day. Avoid feeding fish after temperatures get lower than 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) since they will go dormant and have trouble digesting solid food.",
