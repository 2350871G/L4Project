The side with the glue needs to be on the inside to hold the bead together. Once the glue dries \u2013 usually about 20 seconds \u2013 you will have a bead. After the glue has dried, remove the straw from the bead. Repeat to make the rest of your beads. Be sure to glue and then wrap each bead one at a time. If you apply glue to multiple pieces of cardboard and then wrap them, the glue will likely dry on some before you wrap them. You can wrap multiple beads on the same straw."

        "Once you have finished making your holes, leave the beads in a warm place and let them dry overnight.",
        "It is important that the beads dry out completely before you do anything else with them.",
        "If you want them to dry out a little quicker, consider leaving them near a radiator or a space heater.",
        "However, if you dry them out too quickly, the beads may crack and fall apart.",
        "Sand the beads.",
        "After the beads have dried, take a piece of fine-grain sandpaper and smooth the beads.",
        "One at a time, take the beads and gently rub them with the sandpaper, removing any bumps or rough spots.",
        "Rubbing gently will prevent you from making your beads misshapen.",
        "You can find sandpaper at your local hardware store.",
        "Paint the beads.",
        "With a small paintbrush, apply a coat of white acrylic paint to the beads.",
        "Once that has dried, apply a second coat of acrylic paint in whatever color you want.",
        "The white primer coat helps the second coat of paint be more vivid.",
        "Repeat for each bead, painting different patterns on each.",
        "You can find acrylic paint at your local craft or art supplies store.",
        "Roll in embossing powder or brush a coat of varnish.",
        "Place a bead on the end of the chopstick and spray it with adhesive.",
        "Then roll the bead in some embossing powder until it is completely covered.",
        "Finally, place the bead in front of a heat gun and turn it until the embossing powder melts and the bead is dry.",
        "You can find embossing powder and spray adhesive at your local craft store.",
        "If you do not have embossing powder, you can also brush a coat or two of varnish onto each bead.",
        "You can find varnish at your local hardware store.",
        "Insert a bead core.",
        "Insert some PVA glue into the each end of a bead's holes.",
        "Then insert a metal beard core into each hole.",
        "The bead cores will help prevent the beads from flaking and wearing out once you insert string into it.",
        "You can find bead cores at your local craft store.",
        "Done!",
        "You can now enjoy your paper mache beads for your project.",
        "Enjoy your different kinds of beads made from cardboard."
