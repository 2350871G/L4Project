                    "description": "The fur on your dog\u2019s paws helps to protect their skin. You generally do not need to cut the paw fur unless you notice the fur covering up the paw pads on the bottom of their feet. When this happens, the hair can trip your dog up and cause them to slide around on slicker surfaces. This is a common sign that you need to cut the hair on its feet. Short-haired breeds may only need a slight trim once every 2-3 years. Long-haired breeds may require paw trimming every 4-6 months. It really depends on the specific dog breed and the quality of its coat. Trim your dog\u2019s paws when it\u2019s in a docile and pleasant mood. If it\u2019s extremely excited or especially agitated, it will be much harder to get it to hold still while you trim its paws."

                    "description": "If your dog is standing up, pull the back foot up away from its body and angle it gently towards you. If your dog prefers lying down, roll it onto its back or side to keep its paw raised up and facing you. If it\u2019s on its side and won\u2019t stay on its back, angle the paw up gently towards you. Give your dog lots of praise if it cooperates!Tip: Your dog is very likely to lie down or stand up several times while you\u2019re doing this, so you may need to adjust your grip several times over the course of the hair trimming. Always pull your scissors or clippers away from the dog while it\u2019s moving to avoid accidentally cutting it. Don\u2019t forcibly grab and hold your dog. If it becomes distressed or resists when you try to hold its paw, work up to it slowly. First touch your dog on a part of its leg that it\u2019s comfortable with, then gradually work your way closer to its paw. Praise your dog when it accepts your touch. It should get used to having its paws handled over time. Do the back feet first. Your dog may nip at you if you start with the front paws and it isn\u2019t in the mood for some grooming, but it\u2019ll likely relax by the time you get to the front paws if you start in the back. If your dog loves belly rubs, enlisting a friend to give your pup some gentle pats while you\u2019re trimming is a great way to keep it still."

Grab some dog-safe nail clippers and trim back the front \u20444 in (0.64 cm) of the first nail.

If the blood won\u2019t stop, wrap the toe in gauze and put a dog boot on the foot. If the blood keeps flowing after 3-5 minutes, take your dog to the vet. It\u2019s best if you cut the tip of the nail at a 45\u00b0 angle towards the back of the paw. This will dramatically decrease the odds that you cut the nerve inside of each nail. You really only need to dull the very tip of the nail. Dogs have nerves and blood vessels that run through the center of their toenails and it\u2019s essential that you do not damage them. Be extra careful while cutting your dog\u2019s back nails, since it can be very difficult to see the quick (the bundle of nerves and blood vessels) in the rear nails.

        "Inspect the dog\u2019s paw carefully and look for any individual hairs that you may have missed.",
        "Check in between the paw pads again, spread the toes out, and inspect the edges surrounding the foot.",
        "Cut any loose hairs off with your scissors.",
        "Trim your dog\u2019s nails after cutting the paw hair if necessary.",
        "Since you\u2019re already handling your pup\u2019s feet, now is the perfect to cut your dog\u2019s nails if they need to be trimmed.",
        "Grab some dog-safe nail clippers and trim back the front \u20444 in (0.64 cm) of the first nail.",
        "Only trim the very tip of the nail to avoid cutting into the nerves and blood vessels inside of the dog\u2019s toenail.",
        "Repeat this process for every other nail on the paw.Warning: If a nail starts bleeding, dip the dog\u2019s paw in some baking soda or cornstarch.",
        "This will help stop the bleeding.",
        "If the blood won\u2019t stop, wrap the toe in gauze and put a dog boot on the foot.",
        "If the blood keeps flowing after 3-5 minutes, take your dog to the vet.",
        "It\u2019s best if you cut the tip of the nail at a 45\u00b0 angle towards the back of the paw.",
        "This will dramatically decrease the odds that you cut the nerve inside of each nail.",
        "You really only need to dull the very tip of the nail.",
        "Dogs have nerves and blood vessels that run through the center of their toenails and it\u2019s essential that you do not damage them.",
        "Be extra careful while cutting your dog\u2019s back nails, since it can be very difficult to see the quick (the bundle of nerves and blood vessels) in the rear nails.",
        "If you have any doubts, take your dog to a vet or groomer for a trim, or just file the nails down with an emery board.",
        "Repeat this process on the other 3 paws.",
        "After you\u2019ve trimmed the hair and clipped the nails on the first foot, repeat these steps on the other back paw.",
        "Once the back paws are done, do this on the 2 front paws."
