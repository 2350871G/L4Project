For example, you might choose to create a full skirt and short-sleeved top if Barbie needs a new outfit for a party. Or, you might make a pair of leggings and a sweater if Barbie needs something to wear to school. Or, you might make a new swimsuit and cover-up for a day at the beach!"

If you want to create multiple pieces, such as a shirt and skirt, then try to choose fabric colors and prints that will coordinate well.
