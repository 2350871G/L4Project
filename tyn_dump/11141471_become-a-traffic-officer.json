                    "description": "The process for becoming a traffic officer starts at the legal age of adulthood in your area. It is usually 18, but the requirement may vary depending on where you live. At age 18, you are allowed to apply for basic training. It\u2019s also the age where you\u2019re allowed to get an adult driving license. Some agencies, such as the New York Police Department, allow you to become a traffic officer as soon as you turn 18. They may let you begin training before then. The average maximum age for beginning as a traffic officer is 35. Some agencies set a specific age limit, but others don\u2019t. In general, it\u2019s better to get started when you\u2019re younger."

You need to be able to drive in order to patrol the road, respond to accidents, and get to where you need to go. When you reach the legal age of adulthood where you live, get your license by completing a driving test. If you\u2019re in the U.S., for instance, fill out an application at the nearest Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office. Traffic officers do plenty of driving in patrol cars. Some officers also ride motorcycles or bicycles. If you have to relocate to another area, make sure you update your driver\u2019s license. For example, if you move to a different state in the U.S., contact the DMV to get a license from that state."

        "Traffic officers do plenty of driving in patrol cars.",
        "Some officers also ride motorcycles or bicycles.",
        "If you have to relocate to another area, make sure you update your driver\u2019s license.",
        "For example, if you move to a different state in the U.S., contact the DMV to get a license from that state.",
        "Earn your high school diploma or GED before applying.",
        "Consider these certificates to represent the basic education all traffic officers need.",
        "Earn your diploma by graduating from high school.",
        "If high school wasn\u2019t for you, then no worries, since a GED is more than enough.",
        "Anyone who wants to become a traffic officer needs to have one or the other.",
        "Getting a GED shows you have a knowledge level similar to a high school graduate.",
        "To earn your GED, you need to register for a GED test with your state\u2019s testing agency.",
        "Go to your state\u2019s Department of Education website for more information.",
        "Training for Employment Get a degree in law enforcement if you wish to prepare for service.",
        "Traffic officers generally don\u2019t need advanced education to begin work.",
        "Still, taking a course in law enforcement is a way to learn the ropes before going through basic training.",
        "Find a college close to you that offers a 2-year associate\u2019s degree in law enforcement.",
        "Even if the degree isn\u2019t a necessity, it will look good on your application.",
        "In the U.S. and many parts of the world, traffic officers are police officers.",
        "Keep in mind that some departments may require you to complete as much as a 4-year degree program or 60 credit hours.",
        "If you plan on advancing as a police officer, this experience helps a lot.",
        "In other parts of the world, traffic officers are separate from police departments.",
        "In England, for example, the Highways Agency is responsible for traffic officers.",
        "Officers direct traffic but don\u2019t have the authority to write tickets, conduct searches, and do other things police officers do.",
        "Some areas to study in school include traffic laws, police procedures, criminal justice, and law enforcement.",
        "Take first aid training to prepare for road emergencies.",
        "Since traffic officers are often the first people to respond to accidents, first aid training is a great resource to have under your belt.",
        "Check with organizations like the Red Cross, National Safety Council, and American Heart Association for classes.",
        "You will need to attend these classes in person to learn vital techniques like how to perform CPR and other forms of basic medical treatment.",
        "You get a certificate for completing the course.",
        "Some police departments may require you to get a certificate, so check the requirements before applying for work.",
        "Saskatchewan Highway Patrol, for instance, requires you to earn a certificate within 1 year of submitting an application.",
        "Take classes on communication in order to be better at talking to people.",
        "Traffic officers deal with all sorts of people, not all of them friendly.",
        "No matter how angry a driver gets, it\u2019s your duty to be polite but authoritative.",
        "To practice this, consider signing up for some communications classes at a nearby university.",
        "Also, practice your skills by talking to strangers and collaborating for projects.",
        "Traffic officers have to communicate with other coworkers, supervisors, and other professionals.",
        "They also have to know how to deal with the general public to avoid conflicts.",
        "One good way to improve is to volunteer.",
        "Volunteering gives you a chance to work with and serve many different types of people.",
        "You could also hone your communication skills by working on group projects in school or joining a public speaking group like Toastmasters.",
        "Applying for a Job Contact a recruiter to get a head start on the application process.",
        "Recruiters are valuable resources for anyone looking to become a traffic officer.",
        "Go onto a traffic patrol or police department website for more information.",
        "Many websites list who is responsible for recruiting aspiring officers along with email addresses and other contact information.",
        "Talk to a recruiter about how to get started and succeed as a traffic officer.",
        "For example, you could go to the Ohio State Highway Patrol website if you\u2019re in Ohio.",
        "You could also call, email, or send a letter to the highway patrol office for more information.",
        "Recruiters are always looking for good candidates to join the ranks of traffic officers.",
        "They are there to help you succeed.",
        "They can answer your questions and help you complete your application.",
        "Apply for a job at the police department\u2019s website.",
        "Police departments post job openings throughout the year.",
        "These are usually posted at select times, so check back frequently to find out the official dates.",
        "Go to the government\u2019s career portal in order to search and apply for relevant jobs.",
        "The application is easy to fill out when it\u2019s available, requiring basic information like your name, experience, and education level.",
        "City, state, and national governments all have their own recruitment websites.",
        "These official websites display all public service jobs available, including traffic officer positions.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re in Ohio, keep an eye on https://careers.ohio.gov/.",
        "Traffic officer and police jobs may open up only a few times a year.",
        "Keep an eye on the official department website for announcements.",
        "Go through a character assessment with department supervisors.",
        "The supervisors are basically trying to understand your personality.",
        "They are looking for good communication skills that enable you to get along with coworkers and the general public.",
        "Teamwork is very important, so be your friendly, charming self when you go in for the interview.",
        "The job application may include some character assessment questions.",
        "For example, you may be asked about how much experience you have with customer service.",
        "More is better, but inexperience isn\u2019t an automatic disqualification.",
        "Supervisors often interview new recruits and role play job scenarios.",
        "For example, the supervisor could ask you how to respond to an angry driver during a traffic stop.",
        "Try practicing these scenarios at home in the mirror or with someone you trust in order to prepare.",
        "Pass a background check in order to be eligible for the job.",
        "Since traffic officers are public officials, your background is important.",
        "Expect to be asked to fill out a basic questionnaire when you submit your application.",
        "It contains questions about your legal record, such as if you have experimented with drugs or have had recent car accidents.",
        "These questions are often the difference between a successful application and a rejection.",
        "Be honest when answering these questions.",
        "Although you may get disqualified right away, that is better than lying and getting caught later.",
        "The police department will do a separate background check to make sure you\u2019re a good candidate.",
        "Take a drug screening test when the department asks for one.",
        "Being drug and alcohol-free is very important for your duties as a traffic officer, so anticipate testing when you apply.",
        "Once the department processes your application, they will tell you what to do next.",
        "Expect them to send you to a certified state lab, usually for a urine test.",
        "If the test detects anything, your application will be denied.",
        "Driving under the influence is a big safety hazard, so you know for sure that departments require their officers to be clean.",
        "They are very vigilant about drug testing.",
        "The test will be scheduled pretty suddenly so you don\u2019t have much time to prepare for it.",
        "For that reason, stay prepared at all times by avoiding drugs and heavy alcohol usage.",
        "In addition, the police department may submit you to random drug tests after you\u2019re employed.",
        "Completing Officer Training and Requirements Take and pass a written qualification test to become an officer.",
        "After a department checks over all the applications it receives, it sets a test date.",
        "Someone will contact you with the test date, time, and location.",
        "The test consists of multiple choice questions about how to handle your job responsibilities, so it isn\u2019t too tough if you prepare for it.",
        "A good score on the test means you have a solid shot at advancing to the next stage in the application process.",
        "For example, a test question may cover the proper procedure during a traffic stop or the rules of the road in your area.",
        "Generally, you need to score above 70% to pass, but this will depend on how the department administers its test.",
        "Take a physical health and fitness test with the police department.",
        "Wait for a supervisor to call you in for the test.",
        "Medical professionals will check your health to make sure you\u2019re capable of handling the job.",
        "If you pass that, you also have to complete a physical fitness test.",
        "It isn\u2019t like army-level training, but be prepared to run and swim.",
        "Doctors look for health issues that could prevent you from moving around.",
        "If you have heart trouble or a severe mental illness, it might be a problem when you\u2019re out on the road.",
        "Physical fitness tests often include push ups, sit ups, a 1.5 mi (2.4 km) run, and a short swim.",
        "You get scored on each section.",
        "If your score is too low, you may fail the test.",
        "Prepare for any physical tests by training at home.",
        "As long as you\u2019re able to run and swim without difficulty, you probably won\u2019t have much trouble passing.",
        "Complete at least 12 weeks of training at the police academy.",
        "Once a police department accepts your application, they send you instructions about attending training.",
        "At the academy, instructors teach you how to succeed as an officer.",
        "This includes education about driving laws, how to fire a gun, and how to inspect vehicles.",
        "A lot of it is the same basic training that police officers in other departments get.",
        "The exact length of training depends on the department.",
        "Some training programs run as long as 26 weeks, so be aware of how much time you have to set aside before hitting the streets.",
        "Getting to the academy is your responsibility, so have a car and a driver\u2019s license ready.",
        "Many departments operate their own training academies or have programs in nearby colleges.",
        "The academy may not be very close to your home, though.",
        "Become a resident of the area you plan on working in.",
        "Traffic officers are public officials that represent the areas they work in.",
        "For that reason, police departments require you to live where you work.",
        "Plan on relocating to wherever you get hired.",
        "For that reason, you may wish to apply for jobs close to where you\u2019re already living.",
        "You generally need to relocate by the time you complete your training and get hired.",
        "For example, the New York City Police Department requires you to move to New York City within 90 days of getting hired."
