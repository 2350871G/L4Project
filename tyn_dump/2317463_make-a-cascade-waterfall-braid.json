However, it's helpful to have all of these things near you and ready to go as you braid, so you can secure your hair as soon as you're finished braiding. Often, someone will start a braid only to realize they don't have a tie or pin to secure it, and then they risk messing up their hair when they have to search for something to hold their braid. Consider keeping a hair tie on your wrist as you braid. That way, securing your braid when you're finished simply requires you to slip the tie off your wrist, rather than changing hands to pick up the hair tie and possibly letting go of the end of your braid."

Damp hair can easily tangle, but leave in conditioner can smooth it so that it's easier to manage. If your hair is fine, has small, flyaway hairs, or is more than one length, consider applying a styling cream or smoothing serum. A smoothing serum can help tame unruly hairs, and keep stray, flyaway hairs from coming loose within the braid."

Once this sequence is complete, you will begin to add more hair into the braid outside of the three original portions of hair you started with. This process of adding hair to the braid outside of the original three portions of hair is a key component of creating a french braid.

This is exactly the same process as when you first started adding new portions of hair to the braid. Cross this entire left portion of hair over the middle section of hair, and again, let the right portion of hair drop. Since this braid is executed horizontally on your head rather than vertically (like a French braid down the middle of the back of your head), the dropped right portion of hair horizontally across your head gives the illusion of a waterfall. Maintain tight, even tension on your hair as you braid it. Pull your hair back toward your crown to help create a smooth style. If your braid is too loose or you pull away from your scalp, you'll likely end up with lumps in your finished braid.
