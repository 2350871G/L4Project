Generally, the same guidelines for being a good blogger apply for being a good Tweeter. You can't expect a blog with only three posts on random topics to attract many subscribers, can you? Choose your topic. If you want to be famous on Twitter, don't take their question (\"What are you doing right now?\") literally. It's more like: \"What are you doing or thinking right now that'll be interesting to a certain group of people?\" The theme should be specific enough that people know what to expect, but not so narrow that only 50 people would be interested in it. Start with only one to two primary topics or \"tags\". Then expand as your Following grows. Find the man bites dog story. Read news feeds voraciously for a nugget you can spin into a good tweet. Guy Kawasaki, who has over 1,350,000 followers, goes as far as paying employees to find buzzworthy stories for him to tweet. Mix up informative Tweets with entertaining Tweets.

Good bloggers link to other blogs. Good Tweeters retweet other Tweeters. Search Twitter for keywords related to your topic. When you find an interesting one, hit \"Reply\" and add \"RT\" or \"Retweet:\" to the beginning, and post it.

In order to avoid actually looking like a spammer, though, make sure there's never more than a 200 or 300 gap between who you're following and who's following you. This can be handled automatically by various services. Try to keep your followings' number lower than your followers' one-that's what real celebrities do. HOWEVER, do NOT follow 400 people at once. They will report you as a spammer and Twitter will suspend your account. Just follow 100-200 at a time, then let them follow you back. Once you have a good amount of followers, unfollow the ones you followed and follow a new group of 100."

Auto DMs frequently cost you followers. Some people get their DMs on their cell phones, and an auto DM can be an annoying reason to have to check your phone, not to mention the cost that might be involved in receiving it. Do not radically change the content on Twitter after you've already established a Twitter presence. People like consistency and followed you for a reason."

If you can't respond to each answer individually because there are too many, at least send out a general thanks. Stick around to listen. Don't ask a question right before leaving your computer. If people respond, you want to be able to respond to them as quickly as possible, while they're at their computers. Repeat your question several times throughout the day so you get in touch with different timezones and schedules. Make sure one of the times is \"prime time\" when most people are online (usually weekday mornings). Ask your followers to retweet your question."
