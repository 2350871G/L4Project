For example, a pane of window glass has a thickness that may be stated by the manufacturer, but which should be measured to ensure accurate calculation of the refractive index. Send light from a point light source through the object. Monochromatic point light sources are available through laboratory supply outlets. Place the point light source a known distance from the surface of the object. Aim the point light source into the object perpendicularly to the point on the object being struck. Mark the other side of the object at the point where the light emerges. Aim the point light source into the object at an angle. Move the light source such that a line drawn between the perpendicular placing of the light source and the angled placing of the light source forms a right angle. Note the point where the light emerges on the other side of the object. Mark that point where the light emerges. Calculate the Angle Of Refraction Define a right triangle for the light in air. The first leg will be the distance that the point light source was placed from the object to make the perpendicular. The second leg will be the lateral distance that the point light source was moved from the perpendicular generation point to the angled generation point. The third leg, the hypotenuse, can be determined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the other 2 sides. Create a right triangle for the light in the object.

Knowing the dimensions of the triangles, the angles at the boundary between the air and the surface of the object can be calculated using trigonometry. The angle on the air side of the interface is the angle of incidence. The angle on the object side of the interface is the angle of refraction. Calculate the refractive index.
