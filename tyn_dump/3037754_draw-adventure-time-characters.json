    "text": " Drawing Finn Grab a pencil and a piece of paper. When drawing any of the characters, it\u2019s good to look at a picture so you have a reference. You also want to you use a pencil for the initial drawing so if you make any mistakes, you can erase. Finn\u2019s character is essentially made up of an oval shape at the head, and rectangles for the body, legs and arms. Draw an oval for the head. To begin, draw an oval shape that\u2019s wider than it is tall. You want your oval to be a decent size, but not too big as Finn wears a helmet that matches the width of the rest of his body, which you'll draw around this oval. Your oval doesn't have to be perfect because you'll be drawing over it as you continue. Right now, it just provides an outline. Add facial lines to the head. Draw a cross in the center of the oval, and add another horizontal line above the one forming the cross. You should have two horizontal lines and one vertical line. These facial lines will help you to place Finn\u2019s eyes and mouth. If you plan on drawing Finn at an angle, move the vertical line farther to one side in the direction you want Finn\u2019s body to face. Draw these lines lightly as you will erase them later. Draw a rectangle below the head. Start at about the middle of your oval's height for Finn\u2019s head and draw a rectangle that is about twice as long. You don\u2019t need to make the corners of the rectangle perfect right angles. Finn\u2019s body is usually curved slightly to show the character in action. Add the arms and legs. Finn\u2019s arms and legs look slightly like noodles. For the right arm, start below the head, just inside of the rectangle. Draw a line slowly curving upward, like an \u201cL\u201d. Then draw another line following the same path to create the arm. Start the left arm at the same height as the right. Draw a \u201cJ\u201d shape curving out, away from the body and then back in. Each leg is made up of two lines that start wide at the top and get more narrow toward the feat. Don\u2019t put the legs too close together. Finn\u2019s legs are as wide as his body. If you don\u2019t like how your arms or legs look, erase and try again. The hands are made up of three fingers and a thumb. The feet look like bloated \u201cL\u201d shapes with donut shaped socks on top. Shape Finn\u2019s helmet. Finn\u2019s white helmet/hoodie is as wide as his rectangle body, and goes around the oval shaped head. Start just above the arms and draw upwards along the widest part of the oval. The top has two little bumps like rounded cat ears. The top of Finn\u2019s helmet should be only slightly higher than the top of the head. Draw a circle for the opening of the helmet. The first oval you drew is for Finn\u2019s head, this second one makes the opening for Finn\u2019s face. The oval you draw here should be large enough so you have room to draw Finn\u2019s face. Draw Finn\u2019s face. Inside of the oval you just drew, you\u2019ll draw the eyes and mouth. Finn\u2019s face is easy to draw because the eyes are just two small black circles and a curved line for the mouth. Use the facial lines as your guide. draw one eye on each side if the vertical line, and in between the two horizontal lines. Draw the mouth just below the eyes. Draw Finn\u2019s shorts. You should now have the helmet, the face, and the body drawn. Follow your outline and add in Finn\u2019s shorts. The waistline is at an even height with Finn\u2019s left hand. The legs of the shorts go about \u2153 the way down his legs. Draw the legs of the shorts slightly wider than Finn\u2019s actual legs. Erase any lines, like the line that you originally drew as the bottom of Finn\u2019s body, to make the shorts look like clothing. Draw the backpack. The top of the backpack should start at the same level as your top facial line. Draw a half circle around Finn\u2019s left arm to form the shape of the bag. Then add two more lines over his shoulder to create the strap. Add a small curved line about halfway down the backpack. Add the rest of the details and erase your outlines. Finish adding the shoes, which are made up of two small donut like circles at the ankles, and reversed \u201cL\u201d shaped feet. Make sure that you have Finn\u2019s helmet, shirt, and pants completed. These should be made up of three rectangular sections. Add sleeve lines for Finn\u2019s shirt about \u2153 the way down his arms. Erase any of your sketch lines like the facial lines, oval for the head, and any part of the legs that are above the shorts. Color the drawing in. Adventure Time characters don\u2019t need shading and use simple colors. Finn can easily be colored in using greens, blues, and black. Finn\u2019s helmet and socks are both white and can be left uncolored if you are using white paper. For the shirt, use a lighter blue, and for the shorts a darker blue. The top half of Finn\u2019s backpack is light green, while the bottom half is dark green. Color the shoes in black. Add a background if you want. If you want to place Finn in a scene, you can draw a simple hill of grass and a blue sky, or get more creative with a detailed background of your choosing. Drawing Jake Draw an oblong oval for Jake\u2019s body. You want to make your oval longer than it is wide. Jake is medium in his natural size, so you don\u2019t have to draw a large oval. Jake is roughly \u2153 the size of Finn. If you are drawing the two next to each other, Jake comes up to roughly Finn\u2019s waist. Draw Jake\u2019s eyes, nose, and ears. Jake\u2019s eyes are two large circles, his nose is an oval, and curves make the ears. Space the eyes out enough so that you can draw the nose in the space in between. The nose should be at the same height as the bottom of the eyes or just a little below. The tops of the ears should start where your oval begins to curve down. The ears should extend out from the oval and the back in, curling up. Nothing should extend past the top \u2153 of your oval. Add the snout and eyebrows. Jake\u2019s snout is made up of two parts, the part that goes around the nose, and the small mouth below it. The eyebrows are two squiggly lines, like a tilde. The snout is drawn a bit like an upside down \u201cU\u201d, and resembles a handlebar mustache. Start with a line going down from the bottom of the nose. Loop your pencil up and around, finishing the line on the other side of the nose. Part of the snout will overlap your eyes. The mouth is a small half circle under the nose that touches the insides of the snout. Jake doesn\u2019t always have eyebrows, so you can choose not to draw the eyebrows if you wish.  Draw the arms and hands using simple curves. For this drawing, Jake will have his arms bent and hands on his hips, The arms are simple zigzags that start roughly at the same height as the bottom of the snout. The hands are simple with three fingers. Think of the arms and the side of Jake\u2019s body as forming an \u201cR\u201d shape. For Jake\u2019s right arm, draw a reversed \u201cR\u201d. Draw the legs and feet. Jake\u2019s legs are almost as long as his body. The legs are formed by two slightly curved lines that connect to one another by small feet. Bow the legs out slightly to give Jake more of a springy look. Erase any intersecting lines. Now you want to erase the parts of your oval around the ears, the arms, and legs. Also make sure to erase the parts of the eyes that intersect with the snout. When done, Jake\u2019s arms and legs should look like seamless, connected parts of the body. The ears should also have no lines that separate each ear from the side of the head. Fill in the eyes. Jake has two different kinds of eyes. Sometimes he will have watery looking eyes which have two circles, or normal eyes with one circle. If you want to give Jake watery eyes, then draw one bigger circle and one smaller one. Leave the circles white and fill in the rest of the eye. For Jake\u2019s normal eyes, draw a crescent moon shape on the left side of each eye. Color in the crescent part, and leave the rest white. Trace with a pen and color. Jake\u2019s color is a golden brown. Color the whole body in and don\u2019t add any shading. Drawing BMO Draw a rectangle. To draw BMO, start with a small, horizontal rectangle to form the video screen and face. Round the corners of your rectangle. Draw a rectangular cube around your first rectangle. BMO\u2019s body is made up of a 3D cube. Start by drawing a slightly slanted rectangle around your first one. Then draw two parallel lines going up at a forty-five degree angle from the top two corners of your rectangle. Draw a third parallel line from the bottom left corner. Connect the end of these three lines together to form a cube. Add the arms and legs. BMO\u2019s arms are made of \u201cJ\u201d shapes, with his right arm pointing up, and his left arm rotated forty-five degrees for this drawing. BMO\u2019s right leg is drawn like a backwards \u201cL\u201d shape, or a boomerang. The left leg is straight. BMO\u2019s hands are made up of three fingers that are connected. Draw the legs at the bottom of your rectangle. The legs should look like each one is extending from under the 3D body. Draw the controls. BMO has buttons, some rectangular and circular slots on the front of his body. On the side he has a speaker that resembles one on a telephone. Down the side of BMO\u2019s body is written \u201cBMO\u201d in block letters. Right below BMO\u2019s face is a slim rectangular slot. To the right is a circular slot. Both of these are filled in. Below the rectangular slot is a directional pad. To the right of the directional pad, draw a triangle with a somewhat large circle under and a bit to the right. To the right of, and above that circle is a smaller circle. Each button is also drawn in 3D like BMO\u2019s body. Under the directional pad and to the left of the big circular button are two small rectangular slots which have curved edges. These slots are also filled in. Draw the speaker on the side of BMO\u2019s body where his arm is. The speaker is toward the top of the body and it has two circles on the top row. Underneath are three more circles. Under those are two more. There are seven total. Below the speaker write \u201cBMO\u201d in block letters. The \u201cO\u201d goes around BMO\u2019s arm, serving as his shoulder. Draw the face and final details. To draw BMO\u2019s face, draw two curved lines that look like rounded triangles without the base. Then draw a larger, curved line for a smile underneath. BMO\u2019s eyes and mouth are positioned in the top \u2153 of his face. Erase any overlapping lines. Make sure you have BMO\u2019s feet drawn as well. You can draw his feet by adding \u201cU\u201d shapes to the bottom of the legs. Color BMO in. BMO\u2019s body is a sea green, or teal color. The buttons are light blue, green, red, and yellow. The rectangle that makes up BMO\u2019s face is a lighter teal than the body. The side of the body that has the arm and lettering is a darker teal. The lettering and slots are the darkest teal color. The directional pad is yellow. The triangle is light blue. The small circle is green. The big circle is red.",
