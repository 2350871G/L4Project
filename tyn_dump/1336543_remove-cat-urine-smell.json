Repeat with new paper towels until you are unable to soak up any more urine. Skip this step if the urine has already dried. You can also use old throw-away towels instead of paper ones. The thickness of regular towels allows for better absorption, soaking up more cat urine. If available, use a white towel. Once there's no longer a yellow-tint to the liquid being absorbed, you'll know all the urine has been absorbed."
