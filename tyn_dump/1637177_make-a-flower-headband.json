Press and hold the petal layer down for about 10 seconds. Space the flowers out as evenly as you want. Continue to add flowers to the headband until you are satisfied with the headband. If you are using any glue other than a glue gun, consider first applying glue to the flower, then placing it on the headband. It will create less mess."
