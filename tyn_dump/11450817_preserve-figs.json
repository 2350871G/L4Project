        "Try to avoid stirring with a metal spoon, as you could end up burning yourself.",
        "Stir the ingredients together until they form a syrup.",
        "Keep mixing the sugar and water together until the consistency begins to change.",
        "Examine the texture of the mixture as you stir, and take note of how runny or thick it is.",

        "Take \u00be tsp (3 g) of ascorbic acid or 0.25 cups (59 mL) of lemon juice and add it into the syrup.",
        "Stir the preservative ingredient until it\u2019s fully dissolved into the sugar mixture.",

        "Try to avoid overflowing the containers with syrup.",
        "Seal the containers and freeze them for 6-8 months.",
        "Place the lid or top on your designated fig containers and push out any extra air from the surface.",

        "Don\u2019t worry about removing the skin or stem for the canning process.",
        "Unlike other preservation methods, figs keep their stems and skins attached when canned.",
        "Fill a large pot with water and set it to boil.",
        "Take an 8 to 12 US quarts (7,600 to 11,400 mL) pot and fill it at least halfway with water.",

        "Take your cleaned figs and dump them into the pot of water.",
        "Set a timer for 2 minutes, and wait for the fruit to boil.",
        "Don\u2019t skip this step, as boiling the figs helps them to become soft and a little mushy, which is necessary for canning.",

        "Don\u2019t leave the figs in the water for too long.",

        "Make sure you have enough syrup to fully coat all of your figs.",
        "Soak the figs in the syrup for 5 minutes.",
        "Submerge the fruit into the light syrup, making sure that the figs are completely covered.",

        "If you want to be exact, try setting a timer as a reminder.",
        "Add a preservative to the syrup to keep the fruit from browning.",
        "Pour 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of lemon juice into the fig-syrup mixture.",
        "Drizzle an even amount over all of the fruit before stirring it in.",
        "If you\u2019d prefer, you can use \u00bd tsp (6.6 g) of citric acid powder instead of lemon juice.",
        "If you\u2019re preparing a smaller amount of figs, be sure to use a smaller amount of preservative.",
        "Fill some clean jars with the figs and syrup.",
        "Pour the fig-syrup mixture into however many jars are needed.",
        "Try and fill the containers as much as possible, leaving 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of space at the surface of the jar.",
        "Once all of the jars are filled, take a damp rag or paper towel and wipe any excess off of the jar rims.",
        "Finally, tightly secure a lid on each jar to provide a seal for the canned figs.",
        "Did you know?",
        "Before you can store your canned figs, you need to let them process in a boiling water canner.",
        "If you don\u2019t have this device on hand, fully submerge the jars in a pot of boiling water to finish preserving the fruit.",
        "If you live in a low altitude area, you only have to leave the jars in the boiling water canner for 45-55 minutes.",
        "If you live in a location with a higher altitude, keep the jars in the device for 55-65 minutes.",
        "Try to eat the figs within 1 year of preserving them.",
        "Label your jars so you can remember how old the canned figs are.",
        "Keep your canned fruit in a dry and cool place, where it won\u2019t come into contact with sunlight.",
        "While your canned figs will taste best in the first year, you can still eat them within the first 2-3 years.",
        "Always check the fruit to ensure that there\u2019s no foul odor wafting out of the jar.",
        "Ideally, try and keep your canned food in an area that\u2019s 50 to 70 \u00b0F (10 to 21 \u00b0C), like a basement or pantry."
