    "text": " Preparing the Crust Crush 22 Oreo cookies into a fine crumble. The easiest and quickest way to do this would be in a food processor fitted with metal blades. If you don't have a food processor, simply place the cookies into a plastic, resealable bag, and whack them with a rolling pin. When you are done, there should be no large chunks left. If you can't find Oreo cookies, try another type of chocolate sandwich cookie. Melt \u00bc cup (55 grams) of butter, and let it cool enough to handle. You can melt the butter in a dish in the microwave, or in a small saucepan on the stove. Combine the melted butter and crushed cookies in a bowl. Keep stirring until the butter and cookies are evenly mixed together. You can use a spoon or a rubber spatula to do this. Place the mixture into a 9 inch (22.86 centimeters) wide pie pan. The pie pan can be made out of metal or glass. Most bakers find that glass pie pans heat more evenly than metal ones. Spread the mixture across the bottom and sides of the pan. You can do this using your hands, the back of a spoon, or a rubber spatula. Make sure to press down firmly, or the crust won't hold together very well. If you don't want to get your hands dirty, cover the crust mixture with plastic wrap first. Place the pie pan into the fridge, and wait at least 1 hour. During this time, the melted butter will harden, an make your crust more solid. Preparing the Filling In a bowl, whisk together 2 cups (475 milliliters) of milk and 1 (5.9 ounce/167 grams) package of instant chocolate pudding mix. Keep whisking until the pudding becomes solid, about 1 minute. To speed up the process, you can also use a food processor or a handheld mixer. Fold \u00bd cup (112.5 grams) of the whipped cream topping into the pudding. Use a rubber spatula and a \"rolling\" motion, so that you are always bringing the mixture from the bottom to the top. Keep folding until everything is evenly mixed together. Save the remaining \u00bd cup (11.5 grams) of the whipped topping for later. Try to use the kind of topping that comes in a tub, such as Cool Whip. Set the pudding mixture aside until it sets, about 5 minutes. You will be adding the pudding mixture last. During this time, you can start preparing the melted chocolate mixture for the first layer. Melt 4 ounces (115 grams) of semisweet chocolate in a small saucepan over the stove. Stir the chocolate often with a rubber spatula so that it does not scorch. Be careful not to get the chocolate wet, or it will seize. Remove the saucepan from the stove, and stir in \u00bc cup (60 millimeters) of condensed milk. Keep stirring until the milk and chocolate are evenly combined. There should be no streaks or swirls. Putting the Pie Together Take the pie crust out of the fridge, and set it down on the counter. The pie crust will never become truly hard; it will always be a little crumbly. Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the pie crust. Use a rubber spatula to help spread it around. Make sure that the mixture covers the entire bottom of the crust. Consider adding \u00bc cup (30 grams) of chopped pecans on top of the mixture. This will give your pie an extra crunch. If you don't like nuts, you can omit this step. Pour the chocolate pudding mixture on top. Again, use a rubber spatula to help spread the pudding evenly across the pie. Be careful not to disturb any of the previous layers. Spread the rest of the whipped cream topping on top of the pudding. To make the peaks, gently tap the whipped cream with a rubber spatula. Don't worry about garnishing the pie just yet. It needs to set first. Cover the pie loosely, place it into the fridge, and wait until it sets. This will take at least 2 to 4 hours. Leaving the pie in the fridge overnight would be better, however.
