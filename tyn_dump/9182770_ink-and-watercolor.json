This will preserve your drawing and allow you to trace over it with ink later. Let the liquid mask dry fully before you start painting over it. It should dry in about 30 minutes. Liquid mask is a thin, putty-like substance that dries quickly and will protect your pencil lines from being smudged or washed away by the watercolor paints. The fine line applicator comprises a small plastic bottle (which can be filled with any liquid) and a fine-tipped, needle like point that you\u2019ll use to apply the liquid mask precisely over your pencil lines. Both of these supplies will be available at any art-supply store. You can also purchase liquid mask and empty fine line applicator bottles online."

Repeat this process with each of the paint colors that you plan to use, being careful to keep each color separate from the others. Thoroughly rinse your paintbrush off between colors. Otherwise you\u2019ll end up ruining one paint color by smearing another in it. A watercolor palette contains multiple shallow-bowl like indentations. This allows you to mix multiple colors without letting them run together. As a rule, watercolors look better when the colors are mixed generously with water. This will increase the transparency of the wash and allow for more expressive final results. Mix only the colors that you\u2019ll need for your painting. For example, if you\u2019re painting a mountainous landscape, you\u2019ll need to mix a few different shades of gray, white, blue, green, and probably black."

For example, if you\u2019re painting a mountainous landscape, you\u2019ll need to mix a few different shades of gray, white, blue, green, and probably black.
