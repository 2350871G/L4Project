Nevertheless, there are eco-friendly alternatives that are both low in odor and toxicity out there. A few of them include Gp 2000 Coatings Remover, DoradoStrip, and Soy-Gel Paint and Urethane Remover. These are still aggressive strippers, so follow all directions on the can and use due care.

If it needs to be sprayed on the surface a hand-pumped sprayer is usually a good choice, but consider the sprayer disposable.
