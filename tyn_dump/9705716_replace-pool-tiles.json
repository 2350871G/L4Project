Once the area is clear, turn off the pump and let the tile dry off completely. It\u2019s best to do this in bright sunlight, which will dry the tile quickly. If you\u2019re only replacing a couple tiles along a top edge, you\u2019ll only need to drain enough water to expose the area and keep it from being splashed. If you\u2019re redoing your entire pool, drain all of the water and let it sit for a day or 2, until it\u2019s fully dry. There are also special adhesives available for re-attaching single tiles underwater. However, your repair will be much more effective and durable if you drain your pool first."
