Use a round brush dipped in nail polish remover to clean up the white tip on the inside of the nail so that the white line appears nice and round. Apply a sheer pink on top so that the white is not too harsh, and follow with a top coat to make the polish last."

        "Although you may be tempted to follow the natural curve of your nail, you run the risk of cutting too short, or encouraging nails to grow inward rather than outward.",
        "Make sure your clippers are not dull, as using dull clippers can also encourage ingrown toenails.",
        "If you find it difficult to cut through your nail, sharpen your clippers.",
        "Clean any remaining dirt or grime from underneath your toes.",
        "Clipping your nails will likely remove some of the dirt and buildup deposited there, but you may still have some grime to remove.",
        "Clean your nails with soapy water (or the water from your soaking basin), until you no longer see any dirt or debris, and your nails are clean and light in color.",
        "File the edges of your nails.",
        "Doing so will also minimize the risk of ingrown nails, and will give a smooth, rounded edge to otherwise-sharp nails.",
        "It seems small, but do not skip this step.",
        "Sharp, bumpy edges can lead to discomfort, as well as make the application of polish more difficult.",
        "Apply lotion to your newly-cleaned feet.",
        "Gently dry your feet with a towel, and apply oil or moisturizer to your feet, ankles, and calves.",
        "This is not the time for a quick run-over with lotion; instead, take the time to really massage your legs and feet.",
        "If your feet are naturally dry, use a thicker lotion or oil, such as olive oil.",
        "This will help seal in moisture and ward off calluses and dead skin buildup.",
        "If your feet are naturally oily or moist, a thin lotion or lighter oil such as coconut oil will be a better fit.",
        "Applying Cream and Polish Apply cuticle cream to your cuticles.",
        "Dab cuticle cream into the cuticles of all five of your toes.",
        "Start with one foot, then move to the other, and allow the cream to rest for 2-5 minutes, or as indicated by your particular brand's instructions.",
        "Again, this is an important step.",
        "Failing to soften your cuticles with cream before pushing them down could result in tearing or otherwise damaging your nail and cuticle.",
        "Be sure to properly moisturize before working on your cuticles.",
        "Gently push down on your cuticles.",
        "After the cream has softened your cuticles, take your cuticle pusher and gently begin to press down, bringing your cuticles to the same level as the bottom of your nail.",
        "Dry your toenails.",
        "Remove any remaining lotion or cuticle cream, as both will interfere with the application of your polish.",
        "If need be, dip a rag into the epsom salt mixture and wipe your nails down first, to give the polish a dry, clean surface to grip.",
        "Apply nail polish.",
        "Separate your toes using a toe separator or rag to make application easier.",
        "Beginning in the middle of your nail, apply long, soft strokes to your nail, gradually moving outward, until all of the nail is covered.",
        "Move on to the next nail, allowing nails to dry fully before applying a second coat.",
        "Follow this pattern on each of your nails, no matter how small.",
        "Using this technique provides an even all-over application, and will prevent streaking and clumping.",
        "EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarta Nagorska\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNail Technician\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarta Nagorska is a nail technician and nail art blogger based in London.",
        "She runs the blog, Furious Filer, where she gives tutorials on nail care and advanced nail art.",
        "She has been practicing nail art for over 5 years and graduated from Northampton College with distinction with a Nail Technician and Manicurist degree in 2017.",
        "MN\t\t\t\t\tMarta Nagorska\t\t\tNail Technician\t\t\t\tTo do a French pedicure: Start by putting white polish on the end of each nail.",
        "Use a round brush dipped in nail polish remover to clean up the white tip on the inside of the nail so that the white line appears nice and round.",
        "Apply a sheer pink on top so that the white is not too harsh, and follow with a top coat to make the polish last.",
        "Dry your nails.",
        "Once you have applied all coats, dry your nails using a specially-designed light, a hair dryer, or the most common method: letting your nails air dry for 10-20 minutes, or until the polish is no longer tacky to the touch.",
        "Letting your nails dry properly will mean the difference between a long-lasting pedicure, and one that flakes or chips within a few days.",
        "If you do not let your polish dry completely between coats or before your topcoat, your polish will be prone to smudging and scraping.",
        "Apply a topcoat.",
        "Apply a clear topcoat to keep color from chipping.",
        "If your nails are prone to breakage, apply a second layer after the first has dried.",
        "Swipe a thin strip over the top of your nail to seal in the tips of your nails and prevent chipping due to your nails striking against your shoes or floors.",
        "Choose a thin, clear topcoat.",
        "A heavy topcoat will only add bulk and increase the likelihood of smudging.",
        "If you do add a second layer of topcoat, keep the brushstrokes thin and long, and wipe any excess off of the brush before applying.",
        "Maintain your pedicure.",
        "To keep your pedicure lasting longer, wash and moisturize your feet regularly.",
        "Use a gentle cleanser and cleansing tool to avoid chipping polish, and avoid salt soaks until your next pedicure; the salt in the soak can tear at your polish.",
        "If you shower daily, wash your feet daily and follow up with moisturizer.",
        "Even if you don't shower daily, clean and moisturize your feet each night."
