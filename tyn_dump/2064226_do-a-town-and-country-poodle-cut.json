Make an effort to calm your dog while you blow dry it. Stroke the dog calmly and speak to it in a soft voice to reassure it.

You can also let your poodle\u2019s hair air dry, but this will lead to small, curly ringlets. If you want your poodle\u2019s coat to be fluffy, you\u2019ll need to blow dry it."
