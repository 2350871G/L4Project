                    "description": "While oak wilt can occur in any species, it\u2019s most common in red, black pin, and scarlet oaks, which have fewer natural defenses for the disease. These specimens should be monitored closely during all seasons and, if necessary, treated or removed to keep them from becoming a threat. By contrast, trees in the white oak family, including white, bur, and swamp oaks, are more resistant to wilt. As a result, it may take longer for these species to manifest symptoms. In the event that one of your trees begins displaying symptoms of oak wilt, treating or removing it immediately will reduce the risk of the disease making its way throughout your yard or garden."

Since the fungal spores that cause oak wilt are invisible to the naked eye, there's no way to tell beyond a shadow of a doubt whether a given tree is infected outside of a laboratory setting. Tissue sample tests aren't always 100% accurate. In some cases, the results may come back negative because the disease hasn't yet spread to the part of the tree the sample was taken from."

Don't prune your trees during the winter through early-mid summer (between February 15 and June 15 in the US). This is when feeding beetles tend to be most active. Always sanitize your gardening implements thoroughly before and after pruning a tree with oak wilt. If you simply must prune an infected tree, or you\u2019ve already done so unknowingly, brush the cut section with a layer of wound sealant or latex paint to close it off. If you must prune during winter through early-mid summer, you should use a wound sealant paint even on uninfected trees, as this will prevent beetles that carry the fungus from feeding on the sap.
