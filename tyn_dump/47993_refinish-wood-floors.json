Using a pencil, color the entire area lightly with streaks of graphite. This will help tell you when you've sanded an area. Otherwise, it'll be tough to tell where you've sanded and where you haven't. Go over the entire floor again with a medium-grit sandpaper.

        "Remove the stripper from the wood.",
        "You can do this in two steps:\nHit the area with a putty knife to scrape off the stripper along with the finish.",
        "Use denatured alcohol in a disposable aluminum pan to clean off the remaining stripper with the help of steel wool.",
        "Do not put too much denatured alcohol in the pan, as it does tend to quickly evaporate.",
        "Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the stripper from the wood.",
        "Different chemical strippers will need to be cleaned using different methods.",
        "Some strippers need to be cleaned with turpentine or paint remover, while others can simply be rinsed with water.",
        "Allow the area to dry completely.",
        "Water or moisture and your new finish don't work well together; be sure to allow the area to dry completely before moving on to the next step.",
        "Spot-sand any scratched or worn areas.",
        "You may need to sand any problem areas before you apply the new finish to your wood floors.",
        "Applying the New Finish Plug any remaining holes with wood paste or wood plugs.",
        "May you had a few cables running into the baseboard; or perhaps those nails we talked about earlier are in need or covering up.",
        "To make a wood paste, mix sawdust with a small amount of white glue to create a paste.",
        "Apply paste over the nails with a putty knife and allow to harden before sanding flush with the rest of the floor.",
        "Find small wooden plugs for larger holes.",
        "If necessary, drill into the floor to enlarge the hole so that the plug will fit nicely inside.",
        "Apply a small amount of wood glue around the side of the plug, fit the plug into the hole so that the grain of the plug and the grain of the floor match well, and hammer down lightly.",
        "Allow to dry completely before sanding flush with the rest of the floor.",
        "Clean the floor.",
        "Before you apply any finish, be sure to vacuum and/or clean up any debris.",
        "You want your entire floor cleared of any sawdust, debris, or stripper before you apply the new coat.",
        "Make sure also that your floor is completely dry before applying the new finish.",
        "Apply the stain.",
        "Once the floor is ready to be refinished, apply the water-based stain or finish of your choosing evenly onto the floor.",
        "Make sure that before you actually start to apply the coat to your floor, you have the windows open for ventilation, you're wearing a mask to keep the fumes from bothering you, and you've spot tested the finish so you reasonably know what it's going to look like on your floor.",
        "Also use gloves and a synthetic bristle brush when applying the finish.",
        "Start with the perimeter of the floor and work your way in.",
        "A 3-inch band is all you'll need for a perimeter.",
        "Use a lamb\u2019s wool applicator pad to do most of the work for you.",
        "You can use a watering can with a bit of cheesecloth on top to pour the finish onto the floor, and then use your applicator pad to mop the finish into the floor evenly and cleanly.",
        "Make sure that you leave yourself an area to exit once the finish has been applied.",
        "You don't want to have to walk over the newly-stained floor with your dirty shoes when you want to let the finish dry.",
        "Wait for the finish to dry.",
        "If necessary, apply another coat of stain or finish to deepen the color.",
        "Use the same techniques as your first coat, but sand the area with a fine 300 grit sandpaper first.",
        "Also, be sure to take proper safety and handling guidelines into consideration.",
        "Finish with a polyurethane coating when the stain dries, if desired.",
        "It is much easier to use a long-handed roller rather than a brush, and it gives a nicer finish.",
        "It is important to lightly sand after each application with 220 to 300 grit sandpaper.",
        "Clean after each sanding with tack cloth.",
        "It may take 24 hours between applications for the polyurethane to dry and you will need a minimum of three coats for best results."
