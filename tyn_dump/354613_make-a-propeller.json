                    "description": "Most propellers have two, three, or four blades. Some large aircraft use propellers with even more blades. The more powerful the engine driving the propellers, the more propellers will be needed to distribute the power evenly. While it is possible to carve a three or four blade propeller, it is best to start by building a 2-blade propeller as it is easier for a beginner to construct. Adding blades adds cost, weight and building time."

                    "description": "Similar to the amount of propeller blades, increasing the length of the blades can help to handle a more powerful engine. However, blade length can only be increased so much because the blades still need to clear the ground. Measure the distance between the nose and the ground to get an idea of your blade length limitations."

Determine the width of the blade and the angle of attack. Propeller blades are fixed to their hub at an angle, just as the thread on a screw makes an angle to the shaft."

                    "description": "A propeller blade is like a wing with a twist. The twist of the blade makes the propeller more efficient at pushing air or water. This is because the speed of the propeller blade is much faster at the tip than at the hub. By twisting the blades, the propeller can maintain the same angle of attack across the length of the blades. To figure out the pitch you can use a prop calc."

                    "description": "All well-built wood propellers are better at handling the aircraft vibrations, but you need to use a strong, light wood like maple or birch. Note the grain of the wood when you select your material. A straight grain that is uniform will help with balancing the prop. Get about 6-8 planks that are 3/4 to 1-inch thick and about 2 meters long. You can use extra pieces that you cut. The more layers you have the stronger your prop will be. Even if the layers are very thin. To safe time you can try to find a lumber supplier that makes laminated wood planks that will suit your purpose."
