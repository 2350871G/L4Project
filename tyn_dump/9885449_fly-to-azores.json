Only a handful of commercial airlines have regular routes in and out of the Azores, which means your options may be limited, depending on where you live. Air Azores, Tap Portugal, Delta Airlines, Primera Air, Tui Fly, Ryanair, and Germania are currently the only airlines with nonstop routes to the Azores.

If you live elsewhere in the US, it will be necessary to first fly or drive to one of these cities in order to catch your flight out of the country. A direct flight from Boston, New York, or Providence only takes about 4 hours, whereas flying from Oakland will increase your overall travel time to 9.5-10 hours.
