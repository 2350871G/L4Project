Before you begin mixing your plaster, make sure your buckets, trowels, floats, and anything else that will come into contact with the wall are spotless. If you wouldn\u2019t be willing to eat off of it, it isn\u2019t clean enough. If even a small trace of plaster leftover from the previous job finds its way onto the wall, it could interfere with the plaster\u2019s ability to stick to the wall or set properly. Use cold water, let it soak in and mix as little as possible if you want the plaster to set slowly. Use hot water and mix a lot if you want the plaster to set very fast."

Plastering can get pretty messy, so this simple measure can spare you an exhaustive cleanup process later on. Plaster is hardest to clean off dark walls because you will have to wash of any plaster that dropped with rags and water later. Plaster can also damage or scratch wood or laminate floors, so be sure to cover your floors well. For airtight protection, use painter's tape to secure the dropcloth directly to the floor beneath the wall. When you're finished, just roll up the drop-cloths, take them outside, and spray them clean. The biggest cause of plaster falling off of the tools is mixing in too much water. As you get better, you will drop less plaster, you will get less on your hands and cleanup will be less."

When you\u2019re done, wipe the wall with a damp cloth to pick up what you loosened with the brush. Prime over stained areas to ensure the plaster will adhere properly. Repair any cracks in the wall before plastering it. To test whether the wall is ready to accept new plaster, run your finger over the surface. If it comes away caked with dust, it still needs some work. Spraying the wall with water will help the new plaster to adhere to the old wall. You should always begin by cleaning your work surface, whether you\u2019re resurfacing an old wall or plastering over brand new lath. Dust, soap, oil, tar and mold all cause the plaster not to adhere to the surface. Also a wall that is too dry causes the water to be absorbed out of the plaster and set before it has time to stick to the wall."

You must know that mixing the plaster with an attachment on your drill will cause the plaster to set much faster. Use the attachment for large jobs, where you will apply a lot of plaster in a short amount of time.

        "If you want, however, you can wet the hawk slightly to help it release.",
        "Use your trowel to ready a small amount of plaster.",
        "Slide the flat edge of the trowel under one end of the plaster and pick up enough to layer on a strip from floor to ceiling.",
        "To ensure accuracy and efficiency, make sure the plaster is sitting directly in the center of the trowel.",
        "Start with a conservative amount of plaster and add more as needed.",
        "It\u2019s much easier to build the coat as you go than it is to even out an oversized glob.",
        "Smear the plaster onto the wall, starting with the bottom corner.",
        "Crouch down and push the plaster up the wall in a gentle arc, standing as you go to reach the higher parts.",
        "At the top of your stroke, slide the trowel over 2-3 inches (5-8cm), then reverse the motion and bring it down again.",
        "You\u2019ll use this same technique to smooth on the plaster a little at a time.",
        "If the plaster is soft and slides down a little on the wall, let it set 5 minutes to harden a little, then hit it with the trowel again and it will not slip.",
        "Keep your trowel at a slight angle.",
        "Holding it flush can pull plaster away from the wall.",
        "For the first coat, aim for a thickness of roughly 3/8\u201d (1cm).",
        "Plaster the wall in sections.",
        "Continue working your way along the wall, spreading the plaster from bottom to top.",
        "Pause as needed to scoop more plaster onto your hawk board.",
        "Repeat this pattern until the plaster has been spread evenly over the entire surface.",
        "You may need a step ladder to hit the upper corners of the wall.",
        "Don\u2019t worry too much about getting the thickness perfect at this point.",
        "You\u2019ll be going back over the plaster later to smooth and polish.",
        "Smooth the first coat of plaster.",
        "Once the plaster is in place, clear your trowel and run it over the wall in all directions.",
        "Apply a consistent amount of pressure, focusing on spots where the plaster is thicker or the higher edges have created seam.",
        "Imagine that you\u2019re icing a cake\u2014each sweep should leave the surface more polished and level.",
        "If necessary, use a spray bottle to re-wet the first sections of plaster.",
        "This will make them respond better to the trowel.",
        "A wet high-quality paintbrush can come in handy for touching up tricky edges and corners.",
        "Scrape the plaster to add texture before adding the second coat (optional).",
        "Consider scoring the wet plaster to create a better base for the second coat.",
        "Rake the plaster vertically from one end to the other with a deviling float or notched trowel.",
        "Now that you\u2019ve given the rest of the plaster something to hold onto, you won't have to worry about it cracking or separating.",
        "If you don\u2019t have access to either of these tools, you can also use an ordinary fork, though this may take quite a bit longer.",
        "Scoring creates shallow grooves that increase the overall surface area of the wall and allows the second coat to adhere better.",
        "Spreading and Polishing the Finish Coat Spread on a second and final coat of plaster.",
        "The outer \u201cskim\u201d coat can also be around 3/8\u201d, though you can get away with a layer as thin as 1/12\u201d, or about 2mm.",
        "Apply this coat exactly as you did the first, making sure there are no obvious gaps or seams.",
        "You can smooth the skim coat with your trowel or trade it out for a float to take care of the finishing touches.",
        "Use a float to get an even finish.",
        "Glide the float lightly over the surface of the wet plaster in all directions to work out any lumps, lines, holes, and inconsistencies in thickness.",
        "When you\u2019re done, the wall should have a smooth, uniform appearance.",
        "Take your time.",
        "Smoothing plaster is  a painstaking task, but one that is important to do correctly.",
        "Be careful not to polish the plaster too much.",
        "Eventually, it will begin to take on a glossy quality, which can weaken the hold of paint and wallpaper.",
        "Allow the plaster to set.",
        "Depending on various conditions, plaster can take anywhere from 2-5 days to fully harden.",
        "Avoid handling the fresh plaster as it dries.",
        "Any imperfections it picks up during this time will be visible in the finished wall.",
        "Factors like the composition of your plaster, the temperature of your work area, and the amount of moisture in the air can all have an impact on drying times.",
        "The wall should be totally dry before you add paint, wallpaper, or any other decorations."
