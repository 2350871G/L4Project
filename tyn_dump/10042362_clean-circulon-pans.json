Alternatively, rinse your pan thoroughly, squeeze in some soap, and fill the pan with water. Then, sit your pan in your sink for a few minutes. This is a good idea if you don\u2019t have major food residue on your pan. When cleaning Circulon pans, it is best to use mild dish soap, rather than harsh cleaners.
