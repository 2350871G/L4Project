Place the index, middle, and ring fingers on the three keys. If you have a double horn, place your thumb on the trigger key, then wrap your pinky around the ring below the third key. Next, you want to work on your right hand positioning. Sit up in a chair with your back straight so that you can breathe into the horn without obstruction. You usually want to sit on the edge of the chair to prevent slouching. Hold the horn at a 45-degree angle with the mouthpiece toward your face. Cup your hand and place your left thumb on the thumb key. Put your left index, middle, and ring fingers on the three keys on top. Your left pinkie should be through pinkie ring, and your right hand inside of the bell. Now that your fingers are in place, bring the horn up so that the mouthpiece is against your lips."
