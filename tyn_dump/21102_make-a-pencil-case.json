If you use light-colored cotton fabric, be aware that the paper towel tube may show through it. Cut the circles out with \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowances.

Using Ziploc Bags and Duct Tape Get a 1-quart (0.95 L) Ziploc bag. There are lots of different types of Ziploc bags, but the type that work the best for pencil cases are the 1-quart (0.95 L) bags made from thicker plastic. It would be even better if the bag has a slider on the top. This will make it more zipper-like and easier to use. Avoid using a regular, sandwich-sized bag, as it may not be big enough for your pens and pencils. Lay 2 strips of duct tape across the front of the bag. Cut 2 strips of duct tape that are 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than your bag. Lay the first strip horizontally across the front of the bag, just below the zipper part. Place the second just below the first strip. For a more durable bag, overlap the strips by about \u20448 to \u20442 inch (0.32 to 1.27 cm). Make sure that the strips are centered. You want to have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of duct tape hanging off of the side edges. The duct tape can be solid-colored or patterned. Fold the excess duct tape over onto the back of the bag. Flip the bag over first and smooth out any ripples. Fold the excess duct tape over onto the back of the bag. Do the left side first, then the right. Do not cut the excess duct tape off. You want it to wrap around the side seams on the bag. This will make it stronger. Repeat the process for the back of the bag. Take your next 2 strips of duct tape and lay them across the back of the bag. Flip the bag over to the front, and fold the excess tape down. If you overlapped the tape for the front of the bag, you should overlap it by the same amount on the back too. Cut the bottom of the bag until it is 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the tape. Use a ruler and a permanent marker going across the bag, 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the bottom edge of the last strip of tape. Cut along this line, then discard the bottom portion. It does not have to be exactly 1 inch (2.5 cm). It can be a little less than 1 inch (2.5 cm), but it shouldn\u2019t be more. Lay a strip of duct tape across the bottom edge and fold it onto the back. Cut a strip of duct tape that's the same width as your bag. Lay it across the bottom of your bag, so that the bottom edge is hanging off by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Flip the bag over, and fold the excess onto the back. This will seal the bottom. If you see any gaps, lay a strip of duct tape across the front and back of the bag, aligning the bottom edges. If there is any excess duct tape hanging over the side edges, cut it off. Decorate the bottom and side edges with contrasting duct tape. Cut 2 strips of duct tape that match the height of your bag, and fold them over both of the side edges. Next, repeat the process for the bottom edge of the bag. This will make the side seams stronger and give you a nice, 1 in (2.5 cm) border all around. If you used patterned duct tape for the body of the bag, consider using a solid color for the trim. If you used solid-colored duct tape for the body, you can use a contrasting color for the trim, or a nice pattern instead. For a fancier bag, you can decorate it with shapes cut from duct tape. Add an ID-card holder with extra plastic and duct tape, if desired. Cut a rectangle from a plastic bag. Cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide strip of duct tape, and fold it over 1 of the long edges. This will give you a nice time and make it more durable. Next, cut \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide strips of duct tape, and use them to secure the remaining 3 edges of the rectangle to the front of your bag. Make the rectangle about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) longer and wider than your ID card. Cut the rectangle from another plastic Ziploc bag. Don't use a solid-colored trash bag or grocery bag. Punch holes along the bottom edge if you want to add it to a binder. A 3-hole punch for binders will work the best for this. Otherwise, place a sheet of binder paper on top of your pouch. Align the bottom edge of your bag with the edge of the binder paper. Use a permanent marker to mark the holes, then punch the holes out with a hole puncher. If your pencil case is too short to fit all 3 holes, make just 2 holes. Sewing a Pencil Case Cut four 10 by 6 \u20442 in (25 by 17 cm) rectangles out of fabric. You will use 2 of these rectangles for the outside of the pencil case, and the other 2 for the lining. You can use the same color of fabric for all 4 pieces, or you can use different colors for the outside and lining. For example, you can cut 2 dark blue pieces for the outside and 2 light blue pieces for the inside. You can also use patterned or solid-colored fabric. Canvas fabric will work great, because it is nice and durable, but you can use cotton too. Pin a 10 in (25 cm) zipper between the first outer and lining pieces. Take 1 of your outer fabric pieces, and set it face-up on the table. Place a 10 in (25 cm) zipper face down on top of the fabric, aligning it with 1 of the 10 in (25 cm) edges. Finally, place the lining fabric face-down on top of the zipper. Secure the long edges with sewing pins. The zipper can be the same color as your fabric, or it can be a contrasting color. Use a dress or garment zipper, not a separating zipper. You will end up with the zipper sandwiched between 2 pieces of fabric. The right sides of the fabric should be facing in, and the wrong sides should be facing out. Sew along the top edge using a sewing machine and a zipper foot. Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine and remove the pins as you sew. Be sure to backstitch when you start and finish sewing. You can match the thread color to either the outer fabric, lining, or zipper tape. If you do not have a zipper foot, sew halfway across the edge, stop, move the zipper to the other end of the tape, and finish sewing. A backstitch is where you reverse the sewing machine for a few stitches. It prevents the thread from unraveling. Fold the fabric away from the zipper and press it with an iron. At this point, the fabric is laying across the zipper, covering it. Pull both pieces of fabric away from the zipper so that you can see the right sides. Press the folded edges of the fabric with an iron on both sides. Use a heat setting suitable for the fabric that you are working with. In most cases, this will be the \"cotton\" setting. Fold the fabric enough so that it lines up with the stitching. Topstitch the fabric for a nicer finish, if desired. Match the thread color to the fabric and the bobbin color to the lining. Sew as close to the folded edge of the fabric as possible. A \u20448 in (0.32 cm) seam allowance should be plenty. This will also help prevent the fabric from bunching up and accidentally getting caught in the zipper. Repeat the process for the other side of the zipper. Again, sandwich the zipper tape between the outer and lining fabric. Secure everything with sewing pins, then sew across the long edge. Remove the pins, fold the fabric away from the zipper, then press the folded edges with an iron. Open the zipper and pin the pieces with the right sides facing in. Take the 2 outer pieces, and press them together so that the right sides are facing in and the wrong sides are facing out. Secure the long and short edges with sewing pins, then repeat the process with the lining. Fold your seam allowance and zipper tape against the lining fabric. Leave the zipper open halfway. This is very important, otherwise you won't be able to turn the bag right-side-out all the way. Sew the bag, leaving a 3 in (7.6 cm) gap at the bottom of the lining. Sew around the lining first, using a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance, starting and finishing at the zipper. Next, sew around the lining. Start at the zipper and finish at the bottom for the left and right side. Leave a 3 in (7.6 cm) gap along the bottom edge of the lining. Remember to backstitch when you start and finish sewing, and the remove the pins. Change the thread and bobbin color as needed in order to match it to the outer and lining fabric. The 3 in (7.6 cm) gap is important, because you'll need it in order to turn the bag right-side-out. Snip the corners, then turn the bag right-side out through the gap. Cut the corners as close as possible to the stitching without actually cutting through it. Next, turn the bag right-side-out through the 3 in (7.6 cm) gap in the bottom of the lining. You will be left with a bag that is 1 color to 1 side of the zipper and a second color to the other side. Hand-sew the gap shut, then tuck the lining into the bag. Use a needle and thread to sew the gap shut using a ladder stitch. Next, tuck the lining into the outer fabric; you may have to open the zipper further in other to do this. When you are done, you'll have a pencil case that's 1 color on the outside and a different color on the inside. If you need to, use a pencil, chopstick, or knitting needle to push the corners out further. This will make them nice and crisp.",
