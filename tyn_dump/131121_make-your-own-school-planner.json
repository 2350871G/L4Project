But something smaller will be easier to carry, and it will take up less room in your backpack. You\u2019ll also have a choice of bindings. Spiral-bound notebooks lie flat, but composition books and similar notebooks with a sewn binding won\u2019t damage your other books and papers, as spiral bindings sometimes do. If you like to keep all of your papers together, consider purchasing a notebook that has a folder attached or a pocket inside the front cover. If you choose to draw a biweekly calendar rather than listing your assignments, you may find that blank, grid-lined, or grid-dotted paper is a good choice."
