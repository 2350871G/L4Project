If you\u2019re floor is made out of concrete or tile, you\u2019ll need to glue the bottom track down instead of using screws. Putting on the Doors Insert the wheels on the top of the first door into the top track. Hold the door so the top is tilted backward. Then, latch the wheels on top of the door onto the back runner of the top track. The runner is what the wheels roll along so the door can slide back and forth. Each track has 2 runners \u2014 1 in the front and 1 in the back. The first door will go on the back runners, and the second door will go on the runners in the front of the tracks. Drop the wheels on the bottom of the door into the bottom track. Line the bottom wheels up with the back runner on the bottom track and then drop them into place. Don't accidentally drop them into the front runner on the track or the door will be slanted. Insert the wheels on the second door into the runners at the front of the tracks. Do the same thing you did with the first door, but this time use the front runners on the tracks. When you\u2019re finished, both doors should slide back and forth along the tracks without interfering with each other. Adjust the doors as needed. Many sliding closet doors can be adjusted using the top and bottom rollers. Use the adjusters to slightly lower or raise your closet doors, or to make them flush with the wall.
