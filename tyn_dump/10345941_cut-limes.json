                    "description": "Before you cut your lime, remove any stickers on the outside peel. Then, give your lime a 5-10 second rinse in hot water and dry it off completely. This ensures that you have a clean lime for garnishing your drink or plate. Some people scrub their limes with a brush when rinsing them. This isn't necessary, but it can be helpful if your limes have dirt and debris on them, like those picked straight from the tree."

The lime should be able to sit flat if you stand it up on either end. Don't cut deep enough that you expose the flesh of the time. You should just take off the excess, raised peel at either end of the lime."

For a larger lime, cut each half at an angle to divide it into 3 even pieces to get 6 total wedges. You want the wedge to be large enough so that you can squeeze it into your drink or over your food. Try not to make it so small that you won't get any juice from the wedge. If you plan on putting your wedge on the rim of a glass, make a small cut in the center of the wedge's flesh so it can sit on the glass evenly."
