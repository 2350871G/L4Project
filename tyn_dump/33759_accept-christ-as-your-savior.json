            "description": "Many people do not understand the concept of the Holy Trinity, and some explain it the wrong way. Early Christians' beliefs about the nature of God say: \"God is one while being in a Trinity\". The explanation of this is that The Father, The Son (Jesus) and The Holy Spirit are all one: The three of them refer to one and only one God, not by person, but by power, will and love. The Son has the same power and will as The Father and The Holy Spirit: That is why they are one God, and the three of them cannot be apart in anyway, they complete each other in everything. This does not mean if you pray to Jesus you are only praying to Him, this way, you are praying to God at once (The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit). The Father and the Holy Spirit sent The Son to pay the price of our sins, by acceptance of the Son, because again, God is one by will, by power and by love. So when we say that God sent Jesus to Earth, we do not mean that God and Jesus are not the same. In the Trinity, they are different, but are one at the same time."

            "description": "Believing in God and The Bible is crucial to understanding \"What is a savior?\" and \"Why be saved?\" The Bible is God's revealed word to mankind, written by people so yielded to God's will that God chose them to write it. The people who wrote the books of the Bible were inspired (given the words) by God. They all agree in purpose and point to Christ, the Messiah, though they were written over a period of more than a thousand years. The Bible teaches that all people have sin in their lives. Sin is any act that displeases God, as sin separates us from God, who is perfect, such that the payment we are to pay for sin is spiritual death -- permanent separation from God.Romans 6:23: \"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Spiritual Death entered into the world when Adam sinned. Genesis 2:17: \"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eat thereof thou shalt surely die.\" Romans 5:12: \"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned\"\nRomans 5:14: \"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that was to come.\""

All sins, past, present and future were forgiven by Christ at the cross, although men condemned Him who knew no sin to a cruel, physical death. Hebrews 10:10: \"And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.\" Someone had to pay with his life for all of our wrongs. Hebrews 9:22 (NIV)\"In fact, the law requires that... without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.\" Jesus died to pay for the sins of man. However, He rose again, conquering death and making it possible to be saved; so we accept Jesus when the Holy Spirit calls you--not merely our thinking and reasoning it out, but realizing that it is based on God's provision and His gift. In fact, Christianity is not just a volunteer religion. (Jesus called His disciples, they generally didn't come to Him already determined to follow Him.) In the same way we cannot merely \"accept\" Jesus, but we can receive what He gives us through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit does call us--all to repentance (to change your mind) and to follow God--through hearing God's Word and accepting the Good News (Gospel). Those who do not believe have rejected God's free gift, those who do believe only have faith because faith is the free gift of God (by grace)."

Here's a prayer suggestion, please read this suggestion but use your own words. Without reading such words, just tell God what you want to say to Him in your own words, expressing all your love to Him: \"My God and my Savior, I know I have disobeyed you, and I know about all the bad things I let into my life. But with you, my God, I'll never fear even the worst things in life, because you have sent your only true Son, Jesus, to be rejected by self-righteous teachers, falsely accused, crucified, and so He paid the price of my own sins. I come to you, my God, to confess everything I have done in my life, and to tell you I am sorry. I am here to declare you King of my life, my thoughts and my actions. I want you to be my Savior. Please God, forgive me, for I have sinned before you. My God and my LORD, reign over my life, because your reign is perfect and your kingdom will never see an end.
