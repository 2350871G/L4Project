Cool roof coatings are the most commonly-used method to cool roofs because they\u2019re inexpensive, easy to use, and don\u2019t require help from a contractor. Purchase a cool roof coating in white or silver and paint your roof with a roller. Work your way from the edges towards the center of the roof to cover it in your coating.Warning: If your roof sits on an angle, you cannot apply this coating. The coating essentially works like a mirror, and you could blind your neighbors and nearby motorists if your roof is visible from the ground. Painting a pitched roof is often illegal without a license as well. In roofing, the term \u201ccool roof\u201d is used to denote a roof that is specifically designed to reflect heat. If your roof is made of shingles or asphalt sheeting, your roof is already designed to reflect heat and should not be painted. If you want to cover a metal roof, get a coating designed specifically for metal. Cool roof coatings are almost always waterproof as well."

Purchase reflective gravel from a roofing company or at a home repair store and take it up to your roof. Put on thick gloves and use a shovel to spread the gravel out along the surface of your roof. Add a 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) layer across every surface of your roof and use the backside of your shovel to finish spreading it out.Warning: Do not add massive heaps of gravel. They won\u2019t be as effective as a clean, even layer. Large piles may also become hazardous over time as the weight weighs down your roof. Keep your layer of gravel thinner than 2 inches (5.1 cm) to avoid any structural problems. You cannot add gravel to a roof that doesn\u2019t have a rim around the exterior of the building.

If properly installed, polyurethane foam will last for 50 years. It is illegal to install a polyurethane foam roofing membrane if you aren\u2019t a licensed contractor.
