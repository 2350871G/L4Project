You\u2019ll need tools to counter this, such as a list of the reasons you quit drinking. Don't forget all the negative things that drinking has brought into your life, such as guilt, embarrassment, social isolation, legal problems, financial hardships, ruined relationships, and a host of health concerns. If your booze brain says, \"Remember that time you were drunk and...\" you can finish the thought with, \"I hurt someone close to me; I got arrested; I missed work; or I was sick for an entire day.\" Remember, the perceived, temporary positives do not in any way equal the real, long-term negatives of drinking."
