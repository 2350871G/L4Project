If you\u2019re only dyeing a few silk flowers, a normal-sized bowl will work. Make sure there\u2019s enough hot water in the bowl that you\u2019ll be able to completely submerge your silk flowers.

                    "description": "Use a fabric dye in whatever color you want your silk flowers to be. If you\u2019re using a small packet of fabric dye, pour the entire packet into the bowl of water. If you\u2019re using a container of liquid fabric dye, you should only need about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dye. Stir the dye into the water with a spoon. The more fabric dye you use, the darker the final color will be. Check the instructions that came with your fabric dye for more specific recommendations on how much dye to use. Pro Tip: Fabric medium can help soften the look of your dye. According to Claire Donovan-Blackwood, owner of Heart Handmade UK: \"If you want your silk flowers to look really natural, mix a little of your paint or fabric dye with fabric medium. It will water down the dye, giving you a softer finish.\""
