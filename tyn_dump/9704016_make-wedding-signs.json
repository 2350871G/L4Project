Preparing the wood isn't necessary, but you can refine it by sanding the wood with a 60 to 80 medium-grit sandpaper followed by a 100 to 180 fine-grit sandpaper.

As soon as you are done paining, peel off the stencils. If you can't to keep them, clean them by washing them in the sink with warm water and whatever dish soap you have on hand. The stencils are reusable, so set them aside in case you need them again. If you don\u2019t plan on using the stencils again, you can always throw them away. Finish the signs with stickers and additional decorations. Now comes the best part. Once you have the basic design in place, come up with ways to personalize the sign for the big event. You can glue on stickers, ribbons, photos, and other decorations. Try holding them in place with decoupage glue, wood glue, or clear tape. You can always paint on special pictures or messages. Get creative and make this sign your own. Making a Chalkboard Sign Sand the plywood down with a 100 to 180 fine-grit sandpaper. Pick out a solid piece of plywood from a home improvement store or improvise with scrap wood. Smooth it out before attempting to paint it. Rub the entire surface gently with a piece of sandpaper rated between 100 and 180-grit. To wear down tough spots on the wood, start with a 60 to 80 medium grit sandpaper. Follow up with the fine-grit sandpaper. Signs are most often made out of wood, but you can attempt to make yours out of glass or metal. Follow the same steps but skip the sanding. Paint the sign with a roller and chalkboard paint. Pour the paint into a tray and load it onto the roller. Then go over the sign once to coat it. Cover the entire sign, applying the paint as evenly as possible. Wait about 2 hours for the paint to dry. Read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the label to find out how long to wait. The paint should become dry to the touch within 2 hours. Avoid waiting longer, or else the paint will settle completely. Sand the paint after it dries. Use the fine-grit sandpaper again. Go over the entire sign to smooth out the paint layer. If you find any difficult spots, use the medium-grit sandpaper first. Repeat painting and sanding up to 5 times. Roll on another layer of paint, then let it dry for another 2 hours. The trick is to get the paint to look thick and even. You shouldn't be able to see any wood once you're finished. Dry the sign for 72 hours. Set the chalkboard sign aside for a few days. Make sure it's in a location where it won't be disturbed by an accidental passerby, pet, or the elements. If your sign is ruined while it's drying, you can simply paint and sand it again! Rub chalk over the sign to protect your sign. In order to protect the chalkboard once you've painted it, rub a piece of chalk until you've completely covered the sign's surface. Then, simply remove it with a clean rag, and your sign is ready! You can repeat this every time you erase your chalkboard for a longer lasting sign. Draw your design on the board with chalk. Use the chalk stick to create a quick but temporary design. Chalk ink pencils and markers are other options available to you. These aren\u2019t permanent either, but they come in a variety of colors you can use to make brighter signs. Creating a Pointed Sign Cut the wood to size. First, obtain a piece of plywood, then cut it to the width you want your finished sign to be. The employees at your local home improvement store can help you with this. They can also cut the wood to length if you know how long you want the finished sign to be. You can also cut the sign yourself using a hand saw, circular saw, or miter saw. Be sure to take safety precautions, such as by wearing gloves and polycarbonate goggles. Trace and cut lines on the end of the wood to create the arrow shape. Draw diagonal lines from about 5 in (13 cm) down the longer ends to the center point with a pencil. Once you've drawn your arrow lines, erase and adjust as necessary before cutting. You can cut your arrow lines at your local home improvement store or at home. The measurements vary depending on your sign. Adjust your lines as needed to make them even. If you don\u2019t want to cut the wood, you can also simply draw an arrow on the sign! Sand the wood with 120 to 180 fine-grit sandpaper. All you need is a single piece of fine-grit sandpaper. Lightly rub down the entire board. It should feel smooth to the touch. If you notice any rough spots, go over them with a 60 to 80 medium-grit sandpaper, followed by the fine-grit sandpaper. Color the wood using a wood stainer. Put on rubber gloves before handling a commercial wood stainer. Stir the stainer with a brush, then paint it onto the wood. Go over the entire surface in short, even strokes. Stainer gives wood a dark, refined color that goes well with the lighter colors prevalent at weddings. Let the stainer dry for up to 2 days. Read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to find out how long you need to wait. Make sure you set the sign aside so it isn't disturbed. Apply another coat of stainer if you want a darker sign. Paint on the stainer the same way you did before. You will need to wait another 2 days for the sign to dry. Set it aside in a safe spot, then use your down time to assemble your design. Print your design on a computer if you want a stenciled look. An easy way to create a pointed sign is with the printed transfer method. In this, you create your design in a word document on the computer. Directional signs usually use just 1 word, so keep your sign simple. Make the word the same size as your sign. Transfer your stencil onto the sign using a sharp pencil or draw your design directly on the sign. Tape the design paper on top of your sign. All you need is a sharp pencil to finish transferring the design. Trace around all the letters. Press firmly, but don\u2019t let the pencil break through the paper. Color in the letters using a chalk marker. White chalk markers are contrast well against stained wood, but you can try other colors. Remove the papers from the sign, then use the marker to trace around the letters. Then color them in to finish the design. Your sign should look pretty vibrant now. You usually don\u2019t need to add any extra decorations here. Keep it simple so everyone realizes the sign is guiding them.",
