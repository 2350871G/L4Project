Cover the beans with two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) of water and leave them on the counter to soak overnight. Soaking the beans overnight (roughly 10 to 14 hours) reduces the cooking time required, helps them cook more evenly and makes them easier to digest by removing most of the sugar called oligosaccharide, which causes flatulence. If you\u2019re in a rush you can speed up the soaking time by covering the beans in water, heating them to a boil for two minutes, then turn off the heat and allow them to sit undisturbed for an hour. Lentils, peas, and black-eyed peas do not need to be soaked before cooking."
