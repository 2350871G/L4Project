It\u2019s a good idea to get together with a couple of your closest friends and try to brainstorm some possibilities. They know you well, and will be able to tell you if you have a really bad idea and offer some suggestions if you\u2019re drawing a blank. Remember you want to do something that you like, but if you going to be with a group of friends, you want everyone to have fun."

They might disappoint you by not seeming too enthusiastic about an enormous expensive party, but be understanding and work together with them. They really do want you to have fun!
