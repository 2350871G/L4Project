For example, an area that has a width of 500 feet, and a length of 700 feet would be calculated by multiplying 500 by 700. In this case the area is 350,000 square feet. Once you have the total size in square feet, meters or yards you need to convert this into acres. Multiplying length by width gives you the area, or the space inside the boundary of your property.
