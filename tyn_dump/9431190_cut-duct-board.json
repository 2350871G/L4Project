To cut folding ductwork, you\u2019ll need either a red-handled or orange-handled knife, as well as a gray-handled knife and separate utility knife for fashioning the edge flaps. A red-handled duct knife slices a V-shaped groove into the insulation so that the individual sections can be folded neatly over on themselves with no wasted space at the corners. An orange-handled knife creates an interlocking \u201cshiplap\u201d edge. When folded, these grooves create an airtight seal that safeguards against air leaks, heat or cool air loss, moisture drips, and other airflow complications."

It will serve as a straight edge when you begin cutting. Cutting the End Joints Set the duct board on a flat surface. Lay the sheet widthwise across an elevated work surface, such as a woodworking platform or crafting table.

For best results, use a tilting table or some other surface that will give you a little elevation on one side.

Line up the gray duct knife with the far edge and use it to score the insulation from bottom to top. Pull away the trimmed insulation, trimming rough spots with a utility knife as needed. This will leave a shiplap edge that will intersect with the staple flap on the opposite end of the board when it comes time to assemble the duct. The metal blade guard on the gray duct knife will wrap around the outer edge of the board and rest flat against your work surface. Cut a 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide staple flap into the righthand edge of the board.

This section can later be fastened to the top of the folded duct to secure it. Be careful not to cut through the foil backing, or you\u2019ll have no way of conjoining the top and side panels. The staple flap will form a connection with the closure joint you just cut with the gray duct knife. Scoring the Corner Folds Measure and mark the width of each panel.

Line up the guide square with the line for the first cut. Double check the width of the first panel by referring to the measurements on the shorter arm of the square. Place the longer arm to the left side of the mark so you can use it as a straight edge when scoring the board. Use the red or orange-handled duct knife to make your first cut.
