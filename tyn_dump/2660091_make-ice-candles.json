        "Consider adding some fragrance and/or color to your wax.",
        "Most candle-making wax is either white, ivory, or clear.",
        "It is almost always unscented.",
        "You can leave it like this if you want something simple, or you can make it look (and smell) more interesting by adding some dyes or fragrances.",
        "It is best to use dyes and fragrances intended for candle-making.",
        "Stir the wax until the dyes and/or fragrances are completely mixed in, with no streaks or swirls.",
        "Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of fragrance per 1 pound (455 grams) of wax.",
        "How much dye you add depends on how dark you want the candle to be.",
        "Start with a few drops of liquid dye, or a few shavings of a dye block.",
        "In a pinch, you can use a chunk or two of a crayon\u2014just remove the wrapper first!",
        "Attach your tabbed wick to the bottom of the mold.",
        "The easiest way to do this would be to dip the tabbed part of the wick into the melted wax, then to quickly press it against the bottom of the mold.",
        "Alternatively, you can add a few drops of wax into the bottom of the mold first, then insert the wick.",
        "Can't get a tabbed candle wick?",
        "Make your own by tying a paper clip to the bottom of a plain candle wick.",
        "Can't get any wicks at all?",
        "Use a long candle stick instead.",
        "You will have to cut it down starting from the bottom until it is about the same height as your mold, however.",
        "Fill the mold one-half to three-fourths of the way with ice.",
        "To prevent large holes or gaps, make sure that the ice chunks are no bigger than \u00be-inch (1.91-centimeter).",
        "Also, make sure that the wick is centered at all times, or it will end up being crooked when you pour the wax.",
        "Experiment with using different shapes and sizes of ice cubes.",
        "You can even crush some of them with a hammer.",
        "Pour the wax into the mold until it completely covers the ice.",
        "Move the pouring pot around as you pour so that you are not pouring in one spot constantly.",
        "A great idea would be to pour in a swirl or zigzag pattern.",
        "The pouring pot/measuring cup will be hot.",
        "Use an oven mitt or a pot holder to handle it.",
        "Wait for the wax to harden.",
        "It will take about 1 to 2 hours for the wax to harden.",
        "Do not disturb the wax as it sets.",
        "Consider doing a second pour in a contrasting color.",
        "At this point, your candle is almost done.",
        "You can choose to take it out of the mold in the next step, or you can pour wax in a contrasting color over it.",
        "If you take it out now, your candle will have holes in it.",
        "If you fill it with more wax, you'll get a multi-colored candle.",
        "If you want a multi-colored candle, do the following:\nMelt and dye your candle wax as before.",
        "If you used fragrance, make sure that it is the same one.",
        "Pour the wax carefully over the candle; make sure that you pour it from different places.",
        "Let the wax harden again.",
        "It will take longer this time because you aren't using any ice.",
        "Take the candle out of the mold.",
        "You can try sliding the candle out.",
        "If it won't come out, try tearing the mold away from it instead.",
        "It might be a good idea to do this over a sink as there will be lots of water.",
        "Leave the candle in a sink or bowl for a few days so that the water can drain.",
        "You may need to rotate the candle from time to time to help the water drain from all of the holes.",
        "Trim the wick down to \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter), ten use your candle.",
        "Trimming the wick down will prevent the wax from smoking as it burns.",
        "Remember to set it down on a heat-safe surface, such as a dish or a candle charger, to protect your table from melting wax.",
        "Making an Ice Candle Luminary Find two different sized cans.",
        "You want your first can to be at least \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wider and taller than your second can.",
        "This extra space will eventually be filled with ice to make the sides and top/bottom of your luminary.",
        "Try to use cans with smooth walls rather than ribbed walls.",
        "This will make removing the ice easier.",
        "You can also use plastic containers, such as old yogurt tubs or food storage containers.",
        "Glass is not recommended, as the expanding ice can cause it to shatter.",
        "Clean the cans well and peel off any labels.",
        "Don't worry if there is any glue residue on the cans, as this won't stick to the ice; any paper will stick, however.",
        "Fill the larger can with some water, then place smaller can inside of it.",
        "Start by filling the larger can about half-way with water, then float the smaller can inside of it.",
        "Don't worry, you can always add more water later on.",
        "Add some food coloring into the water for an interesting effect!",
        "Fill the smaller can with enough rocks until the rim is level with the larger can's rim.",
        "Do not let your small can sink all the way to the bottom; you want both rims to be level with each other, and about a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) of space between the two cans at the bottom.",
        "The water level will rise as the smaller can sinks into the water.",
        "Make sure that the water is \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the larger can's rim.",
        "If there is too much water, pump some of it out with a baster.",
        "If you can't find any rocks, you can use other items from your kitchen or garden, such as pebbles, rice, dried beans, marbles, etc.",
        "Tape the rims of the cans together so that the smaller can stays in the center.",
        "Cut four equal-sized pieces of tape, and stick them to the top, bottom, and sides of the small can's rim.",
        "Carefully fold the pieces of tape over onto the larger can's rim.",
        "This will help the small can float in the center, and ensure that your luminary will be the same thickness all around.",
        "Consider adding some greenery.",
        "At this point, your candle is just about ready for freezing.",
        "You can make it more festive, however, by filling it with bright items from your kitchen or garden.",
        "Here are some ideas:\nFor a spring luminary: bright green leaves, pieces of fern, and/or spring flowers (ie: Johnny-Jump-Ups)\nFor a fall luminary: brightly-colored leaves, orange slices, and or spices (ie: cinnamon sticks or star anise)\nFor a winter luminary: sprigs of pine, tiny pinecones, twigs, and/or holly berries.",
        "For a summer luminary: leafy herbs (ie: basil or mint), citrus slices (ie: lime or lemon), and/or brightly-colored flowers.",
        "Check the water level, then pour or add more water if needed.",
        "As you add more items into the water, the water level will rise.",
        "You want it to be \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the rim of the large can.",
        "The water will expand as it freezes, and if the water level is too high, it will over flow.",
        "If you have too much water, pump it out using a baster.",
        "This way, you won't risk messing up your added greenery.",
        "If you don't have enough water, carefully pour it in a thin stream into the space between the two cans.",
        "Freeze the water.",
        "If it is below freezing outside, simply leave your can outside overnight.",
        "If it is above freezing, stick the can into your freezer overnight.",
        "Remember, the larger your container is, the longer it will take to freeze.",
        "Take the ice luminary out of the mold.",
        "Run lukewarm or cool water over the outside and inside of your luminary until you can move the cans around.",
        "Peel the tape away, then slide the luminary out of the large can.",
        "Carefully pull the smaller can out.",
        "Do not use hot water, as this may cause the ice to crack.",
        "Use the luminary with flameless candles.",
        "You can use these luminaries right-side-up or upside-down.",
        "Because they are made out of ice, they do not last forever.",
        "If you cannot find any flameless candles, you can use real tea lights instead, but keep in mind that the flame will cause the ice to melt faster.",
        "The melting ice may also extinguish the candle.",
        "If you want a centerpiece for your table, place the luminary with the hole facing up.",
        "Stick a flameless candle into the hole.",
        "If you want to light your pathway, place a flameless candle down on the ground, then place the luminary over it, flat side up."
