To prevent this, pull off a piece of painter\u2019s tape and stretch it to make it sticky, then carefully lay it down on any part of the frame that you don't want to get paint on. It\u2019s easiest to remove any glass or backing from the frame before you start, but if you can\u2019t, painter\u2019s tape should work fine. You can use strips of painter\u2019s tape to create cool designs, like making V-shaped stripes if you want a chevron pattern. You can also lay the tape horizontally to make the sides a different color from the top and bottom."

Lightly rubbing the frame with a piece of sandpaper should create enough grit for the base layer of paint to adhere to the surface. For this project, 180-220 grit sandpaper will work perfectly. Don't scratch the surface; just sand until you remove the shine. If your frame doesn\u2019t have a shiny finish, you don\u2019t necessarily have to sand it."

If there\u2019s just a little dust, you can wipe the frame down with a dry microfiber cloth. However, if the frame seems really dirty, wet the cloth slightly and run the damp cloth over the surface.

                    "description": "The color and finish of your paint are entirely up to you, and picking just the right color is part of the fun of a project like this! Use black for a modern-looking frame, pick a bright color if you want the frame to have a playful feel, or choose a color from the picture you\u2019re framing to emphasize a detail you like. Most paints will work for this project, so if you already have something on hand, give it a try. If you\u2019re buying paint, opt for acrylic paint, a plant-oil-based paint, or spray paint. You can create different effects based on the paint you use. For instance, painting an object with chalk or milk paint will create a distressed effect, or you could use metallic paint to give the frame a shiny finish. You can also create a distressed look by using a darker color as your base coat and a lighter color for the subsequent coats."

Don\u2019t worry about covering everything, since it will usually take more than one coat of paint to get the color you want. If you\u2019re trying to paint a dark picture frame a lighter color, you may want to use a primer for your first coat. Use a large paint brush that is close to the width of your frame for an even finish. Consider using a smaller brush to get more detail.

Let the paint dry completely before you add another coat; otherwise, the paint could smudge or it might not dry properly. Some paints, like certain metallics, will dry more quickly than others. A light coat of paint should be dry within a few minutes. If you\u2019re not sure if the paint is dry, touch it with your fingertip in an inconspicuous spot.

The tip of this pen will reach several hundred degrees Fahrenheit, so use extreme caution once it's plugged in. Never touch the tip with any part of your skin, and always rest the pen on its metal stand. Make sure the tip of the pen is never resting near or against anything flammable, and don't leave the tip pressed against one spot on your wooden frame for too long. Do not use this tool on plastic frames, or wooden frames that have been shellacked or painted, as this will produce dangerous fumes and could be a fire hazard."
