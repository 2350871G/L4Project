    "text": " Removing Dirt and Grime Check for a manufacturer\u2019s label. Examine your cushion seams \u2013 the manufacturer\u2019s care label is usually sewn into one of them. If your cushion still has a care label attached, read the instructions provided before you proceed with cleaning. Make sure you stay within those guidelines, or you may void your warranty. Create a mild soap and lukewarm water cleaning mixture. Combine \u00bc cup (30 ml) of mild soap, like Dawn or Woolite, and a gallon of lukewarm water in a large bucket. Stir the solution until the soap dissolves completely. Soak the fabric in the cleaning solution. Brush away loose dirt, then drench your cushions in the cleaning mixture. Let it sit for about 15 minutes so the fabric soaks it up. This will help break down the dirt and grime ingrained in the fabric. Scrub the fabric with a soft bristle brush. Dunk your brush into the cleaning solution, then scrub the fabric vigorously with it. Keep the fabric soaked in the solution as you work.

For extra resilience, try spraying your fully-dried cushions with Scotchguard before returning them to their places. Put removable casings in your washing machine. Some Sunbrella cushions feature removable casings. Look for zippers on your cushions \u2013 if you find them, the outer shells can be removed. Unzip and separate the casings from the cushions, then zip the empty casings back up. Machine wash them in cold water using the delicate cycle and mild laundry detergent. Double check the care label to make sure machine washing is suggested for your particular cushions. In most cases it will be, but instructions can vary depending on the construction of the casing. After the cycle finishes, air dry the fabric and then replace the casings. Cleaning Stains and Mildew Spray the mild soap and water solution onto stains. When stains occur, Sunbrella suggests spot cleaning. Mix up the same solution you\u2019d use for general cleaning in a spray bottle. Spray it directly on the stain and let it soak for at least 15 minutes. Sprinkle corn starch on oily stains first. If you\u2019ve spilled something oily, like sunscreen, it may stain the fabric. Sprinkle corn starch over the affected area. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then proceed with the cleaning process. Corn starch acts as an absorbent and helps to soak up the oily residue. Use a straight-edge or ruler to scrape away the dried corn starch after 10 minutes have passed. Scrub the stain with a sponge or soft bristled brush. Scrub gently at and around the stain until it disappears. If the stain isn\u2019t coming clean, reapply the cleaning solution and let it soak a little longer before scrubbing it again. Rinse the area with clean, fresh water to remove all soap residue. Blot at the area to soak up excess moisture. Dab a fresh towel or sponge at the spot, soaking up as much excess moisture as you can. If you have a wet-vac, that also works well. Allow the fabric to air dry the rest of the way. Create a bleach, soap and water solution for mildew. Sunbrella cushions are formulated to prevent the growth of mold and mildew, but it can still occur. Combine 1 cup (120 ml) bleach, \u00bc cup (30 ml) mild soap and a gallon of lukewarm water in a bucket. Pour it into a spray bottle. Spray the fabric with the bleach solution. Be sure to mist the affected area thoroughly, but also apply it to the entire surface of the cushion. If you only concentrate on the affected spot, a water ring or light stain may form. Let the solution sit on the fabric for about 15 minutes. Wipe down with a sponge or brush. After 15 minutes, wipe the surface of the cushions with a sponge or scrub with a soft bristle brush.

Thoroughly rinse your cushions to remove all traces of the bleach solution. Let them air dry. Setting them out in direct sunlight can help speed up the drying process. Maintaining Your Cushions Brush dirt off the fabric regularly. Outdoor cushions are going to get dirty \u2013 there\u2019s no way around that. However, you can limit how dirty they get by brushing loose dirt from the surface whenever you notice it. This will prevent the dirt from becoming deeply ingrained in the fabric.
