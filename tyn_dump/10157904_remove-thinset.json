        "Sand your spacer with rough 40- to 60-grit sandpaper to decrease its size.",
        "Rub the sandpaper along the outside of the spacer in a circular motion.",
        "It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to reduce its size with rough sandpaper.",
        "After sanding, your dust shroud should fit snugly onto the spacer without jiggling.",
        "Connect the grinder to a 5-horsepower wet-dry vacuum.",
        "The vacuum hose connects at the top of the grinder to the dust shroud.",
        "Press it into the hole in the dust shroud and it should pop in easily.",
        "After attaching it, secure the perimeter of the hose's seal with at least 1 layer of duct tape to prevent particle leakage.",
        "Always turn on your vacuum before you turn on the grinder.",
        "Guide the 7 in (18 cm) grinder along the thinset.",
        "Turn on your grinder and grip the front handle with your non-dominant hand and the back handle with your dominant hand.",
        "Use your back hand to push the grinder forward and pull it backwards.",
        "Hold the grinder steady with your top hand to keep it from moving around.",
        "Move the grinder up and down in motions and aim to cover about 2 to 3 ft (0.61 to 0.91 m) of vertical space with each motion.",
        "Slowly move it to the right or left as you grind and don't worry about going over the same spot more than once."
