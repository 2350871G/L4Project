If the gasket looks dusty, you may need to occasionally keep the door on your washer closed. For example, if your dog will be crated in the laundry room overnight, keep the door closed.

After the cycle is done, run a few more cycles through without adding any bleach. This will remove the bleach smell from the machine before you wash clothes in your machine again. If you notice black mold on mildew spots after running your machine, you may need to put on gloves, a mask and scrub the spots using a bleach solution. Dip a toothbrush in a solution of no more than 10% bleach and scrub the mildew."
