The most important thing regarding use of a jack (after finding a flat surface) pertains to placement of the jack. Most vehicle manuals will tell you where the jack must be placed, so read it.

The jack stand must be placed under the car frame itself. You cannot place the stand under a fuel or oil tank or other weak spot; the weight of the car will destroy them. Obviously, though, for this job keep them clear from the area of the axles. (See more here.) Raise all 4 wheels of the car. This will ensure safety and precision in removing axle bearings. If you only raise 1 wheel or 1 side of the car, you run the risk of the car falling if it becomes unbalanced."
