        "Alternatively, you can cut the wefts off of a long wig instead.",
        "Cut the hair until it is a little longer than the cones.",
        "If you bought the hair in hanks, separate it into pencil-thin bundles first, then tie it around the middle with twist ties.",
        "If you bought wefted hair, cut the wefts down to 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide.",
        "Measure the hair against the cones, then cut it down until it is about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) longer than the cones.",
        "Glue the weft to the cone with fabric glue or tacky glue.",
        "Spread some glue onto the cone, then press the wig hair into the glue, with the tied/wefted edge facing down.",
        "Use your fingers to spread the hairs as thinly as you can across the glue.",
        "You want the bottom tied/wefted edge of the hair extending past the bottom edge of the cone by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).",
        "Secure the bottom edge of the hair to the inside of the cone.",
        "Draw a line of hot glue inside the cone, close to the edge.",
        "Fold the bottom of the hair over the edge of the cone and press it into the glue.",
        "You can do this with a pen or paintbrush handle if the glue is too hot.",
        "If you tied your hair at the bottom, cut the hair apart and remove the twist tie before you glue it down.",
        "Use a low-temp hot glue gun so that you don't burn yourself.",
        "Set the hair with hairspray and a hair drier.",
        "Holding the hair down, lightly mist it with a strong hold hairspray.",
        "Heat the hair with a hair drier until the glue and hairspray dry.",
        "Repeat the process for the rest of the cone.",
        "A single weft or bundle wouldn't be enough to cover the entire cone.",
        "You'll have to repeat the last couple of steps a few times until you have the entire cone covered.",
        "Trim and glue the tip of the cone.",
        "Apply a generous amount of glue to the tip of the cone, then smooth the hair down so that it sticks.",
        "Once the glue has dried, you can trim the hair into a finer point.",
        "Be careful not to cut away the foam, however!",
        "Repeat the process for the other cone.",
        "It would be a good idea to keep the cones labeled.",
        "You can do this by placing them onto a sheet of paper with their position on the wig written underneath.",

        "If this is too scary for you, drape a thin towel over the wig head, cover it with the wig cap, then put the wig on top.",

        "Once you have the spikes glued on, pull the wig off.",
        "Thread a curved needle with black thread, then sew the spikes on.",
        "Make sure that you are sewing the spikes right into the wig's cap.",

        "Blend the spikes into the wig.",
        "Pin the wig onto the Styrofoam wig head.",
        "Take a few strands of hair from the wig, and smooth them onto the first spike.",

        "Do this down the front side of all the spikes, then the top and back.",
        "Set the style with hairspray.",
