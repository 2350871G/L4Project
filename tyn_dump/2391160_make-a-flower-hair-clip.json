It may also make your hair clip look fuller. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nGlue two to three leaves onto the clip with the points facing outward, like rays on a sun. Glue several leaves down the center of the clip, with the points overlapping each other like scales. Glue a strip of ribbon onto the top of the clip to hide the metal. Glue several long strands of ribbon to one of the ends of the clip. Consider hot gluing a circle of felt to the back of your flower. This is not necessary, but it will help give it some stability. The felt circle should be large enough to cover the back of the flower, but small enough so that you can't see it when you look down at the flower. Try to use a felt color that matches your flower color. Start hot gluing the flowers onto the clip. Place the glue onto the clip first, then press the flower into the glue.

Choose tiny rhinestones instead of large, clunky ones for a more professional finish. Making a Custom Flower Hair Clip Choose some fake flowers with multiple layers. You will be pulling the flowers apart and rearranging them to make your own flowers. Get a few different types of flowers in different shapes, sizes, and colors so that you will have more shapes and colors to work with..\nGreat fake flowers to use include roses, chrysanthemums, and mums. Pull the fake flowers off the stem. They should pop off easily. Discard the stems, as you won't be needing them. If you want, you can save the leaves for filler. Take the flowers apart completely. Pull the plastic nub off of the back of the flower. Then, pull the different layers apart. Discard the plastic stamen, center, and nub. If you want, you can separate the petals into different groups based on shape, size, and color. This will keep your work area more organized and make it easier for you to find what you need. Rearrange the petals in new and interesting combinations. Make sure that you keep the layers stacked. You can combine more of the same flower to create a fuller flower. You can also take out petals from a flower you don't like. Pull a threaded needle through the center of the petal stack. Thread your needle and tie a knot at the bottom of the thread. Push the needle through the center of all of the petals, starting from the bottom flower. There should already be a hole in the center of each petal; use this hole as your guide. String a pretty bead onto the needle. Some beads have a very small opening, so you may need to switch out your sewing needle for a beading needle. Once you have the bead on the thread, switch back to a regular sewing needle. Beading needles are too delicate to go through all of those petals. Try using a pearl bead, or a faceted crystal bead. Push the needle back through the petals and tie the thread in a knot. Once you have your bead on the thread, hold it against the petal. Then, push the needle back through the petals again and tie a knot at the bottom. Hot glue a small circle of felt to the back of your flower. This will make the flower more sturdier. The felt circle should be big enough to give the flower support, but small enough so that you won't see it when you look down at the flower. Try to choose a color of felt that closely matches the color of your flower. Hot glue the flower onto the hair clip. If you saved any of the leaves, glue those down onto the clip first. Then, glue the flower down. Making Silk Flowers for a Clip Choose a 100% polyester fabric. Most bolts of fabric in a fabric store will have a label at one end. The label will tell you what the fabric is made out of. Look for something that says 100% polyester. This is very important. You will be using a candle flame to burn away the edges, so you want something that melts under heat. Natural fabric, such as cotton, will burn. Consider using any of the following types of fabric: organza, chiffon, or satin. Consider mixing and matching different types of fabric to create an interesting texture. Cut the fabric into circles. Make the circles a little bit larger than you want them to be, as they will shrink when you hold them above the flame. The size of the circle will be the size of your flower; you can add petals later. Consider making the circles slightly different sizes. This will add some texture and variety to your flower. Light the candle. The best candle to use for this is a tea candle, but any candle will do so long as it is stable enough. Burn the edges of the circles. Hold the fabric about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) away from the flame. Slowly rotate the circle until the entire edge is lightly singed. The edges will melt and crinkle. If the flame is too hot for you, consider holding the fabric with a pair of tweezers. If the fabric melts quickly, pull the fabric further away. If the fabric doesn't melt, hold it closer to the flame. If the fabric doesn't melt at all, check to make sure that it is 100% polyester. Consider adding some petals. This is not necessary, but it can make your flower look more organic and realistic. After you melt edges, cut four slits, about a third of the way, into the flower. Keep the slits evenly spaced. Pull a slit open and hold the flower above the flame. Keep it as far as you can so that the raw edges can still melt, but not burn. Stack the fabric circles. Place the circles on top of each other in a stack. Play around with different sizes and textures until you get the layering you want. Consider using an odd number of petals instead of an even one. This will make your flower appear more organic and realistic. Stitch the flowers together. Thread your needle and tie a knot at the bottom of the thread. Push the needle through the center of all of the petals, starting from the bottom flower. Once the needle comes out of the top petal, push it back through the petals again and tie a knot at the bottom. Attach a bead, button, rhinestone, or sequin to the center of the flower. You can either sew it on or glue it on. Fabric glue or hot glue would be the best. Glue a small circle of felt to the back of your flower. This will make the flower more stable. The felt circle should be large enough to give the flower support, but small enough so that you can't see it when you look down on top of the flower. Try to choose a color of felt that closely matches the color of your flower. Glue the flower onto the clip. Once you are happy with the flower, place some hot glue onto the metal hair clip. Press the flower down into the glue. Making Fabric Flowers for a Clip Cut out five to six squares out of some colorful fabric. Each square needs to be about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) on each side. Fold each square in half diagonally and press it flat with an iron. You will end up with five or six triangles. These will be your petals. Ironing them will help keep them flat while you work. Make a running stitch along the cut edges of your triangles. Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end. Pick up a petal, and make a running stitch along the cut edges; do not sew along the folded edge. Start at one corner, right next to the fold, and work your way around to the other side. Gather the cut edges. Once you have reached the other end of the triangle, slide the triangle down the thread, all the way to the knot. Keep pushing down until the fabric gathers. If you want, you can tie a knot to keep the petal together. Repeat the process for the rest of the petals. Keep stringing your petals onto the thread using a running stitch. Push the petals down to the bottom of your thread to gather them. Tie the strung petals into a circle. Bring the first and last petals together and stitch them together. Tie the thread off into a tight knot. You should end up with what looks like a ring with gathered petals. Cover the hole with a large button. Make sure that the button is large enough to cover the hole. Draw a line of hot glue around the gathered edges of the petals. Press a button into the glue. You can also use a large beak or clunky, plastic rhinestone. Glue the flower onto the hair clip once you are happy with it. Draw a line of hot glue down the center of the hair clip and press the flower into the glue.",
