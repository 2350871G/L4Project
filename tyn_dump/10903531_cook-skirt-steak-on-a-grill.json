Once the briquettes are hot and lightly covered with ash, carefully dump them onto the center of the grill grate. Since skirt steak is such a thin cut, it's best to cook it quickly over high heat. If your grill grate isn't seasoned, dip a paper towel in a little oil and brush it over the grate to lightly grease it."
