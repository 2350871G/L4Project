Do not move anything until the surface of your spot has been surveyed. Search underneath rocks and dirt clods for diamonds.  Dry Sifting Select a spot on the search area that has loose, dry soil.  Pour only two handfuls (or scoops) of dry dirt into your sifting screen at one time.  Sift the dirt through your screen with a quick agitating motion over one spot.  Spread out remaining gravel and search for a diamond!  Wet Sifting Dig a bucketful of dirt from the search area and carry it to one of the provided washing pavilions.  Pour part of the dirt into a sifting screen, until soil mounds over its top.  Sift all loose soil from your screen in water with a quick agitating motion.  Remove all material larger than about one-quarter inch from your screen.  Hold the frame of your screen on both sides around the center and lower it evenly into the water about one-half inch.  Quickly rock your screen back-and-forth, until water washes small materials toward the center of your screen.  Balance the screen on your fingertips, submerging it in water, and tap it up and down until the water spreads your material out into an even layer again.  Turn your screen one-quarter turn.  Repeat steps 6-8 for about one minute (eight or ten repetitions). Rock it, tap it, and turn it! Tap the screen one more time in the water to spread the materials out.  Remove your screen from the water, and allow water to drain from your screen for a few seconds.
