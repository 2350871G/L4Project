Professional pattern-maker Daniela Gutierrez-Diaz says: \"Take in the sides of the sleeve by 1/4\" each, so it's reduced by about 1/2\" in total. If you need to, adjust the sides by about 1/16\" at a time until the sleeves lay flat on the side. Then, take in the cuff by about 1/16\". You'll also have to adjust the collar because if you're releasing the shoulder seams, then the corner will also have to be about 1/4\" smaller.\""

        "Daniela Gutierrez-Diaz\t\t\tPattern Designer\t\t\t\tLook at every part of the shirt as a separate piece.",
        "Professional pattern-maker Daniella Gutierrez-Diaz says: \"If you want to alter a dress shirt, every part of the shirt needs to be taken apart and altered individually, including the collar and the cuffs.",
        "Bring the sides of the shirt in by about 1/2\" to take the shirt one size down, then check the measurements and take it in a little more if you need to.",
        "You'll also need to take in the sleeves, although the measurement for the sleeve will be different for everyone.\"",
        "Cut along the lines you have drawn.",
        "Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the lines you have drawn onto the ill-fitting shirt.",
        "Make sure to cut straight, even lines.",
        "Do not cut inside or outside of the lines.",
        "Cut right along them.",
        "Cut the sleeves completely off of the body piece of the shirt.",
        "Trim down the sleeves as needed.",
        "Leave the sleeves turned inside out to do this.",
        "Measure the sleeve length on your ill-fitting shirt against the sleeve length of your well-fitting shirt to determine how much you want to trim them down.",
        "To do this, lay the ill-fitting sleeve out flat and then line up the well-fitting sleeve over it so that the sleeve cuffs and top edges are lined up.",
        "Make sure that the well-fitting sleeve is flat as well.",
        "Trace around the bottom edge and arm seam of your well-fitting sleeve with a piece of chalk leaving a \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) seam allowance.",
        "Do this for both sleeves.",
        "Sew along the edges of the shirt.",
        "When you have finished making your adjustments to the t-shirt or button-down shirt, you can sew along the edges to secure the new fit.",
        "Sew a straight seam about \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) from the edges of the body of the shirt.",
        "Do not sew across the armhole openings.",
        "Leave these open so that you can reattach the sleeves.",
        "Turn the sleeves right side out.",
        "Your body piece will need to remain inside out, but your sleeves will need to be right side out to reattach them properly.",
        "Turn the sleeves right side out before you begin.",
        "Insert the sleeves through the armhole openings.",
        "To line up the edges of your sleeve openings and sleeves, you will need to completely insert the sleeves into the arm openings cuff first.",
        "Insert the cuffs into the arm openings and keep going until the ends of your sleeves are lined up with the openings.",
        "Pin the sleeves in place.",
        "After you have inserted the sleeves through the sleeve openings completely, you can pin around the edges to secure them.",
        "Make sure that the edges of the sleeves and sleeves openings are lined up evenly.",
        "Sew the sleeves back onto the shirt.",
        "When you are satisfied with the way the sleeves are pinned, you can sew the sleeves in place.",
        "Sew along the pinned edges about \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) from the raw edges to secure the sleeves.",
        "Remove the pins as you sew.",
        "After you finish sewing both sleeves into place, you can turn the shirt inside out and try it on!",
        "Pinching and Pinning Your Shirt Turn the shirt inside out and put it on.",
        "Pinning and pinching is a fairly easy way to improve the fit of a shirt.",
        "To get started, all you need to do is turn the shirt inside out and put it on.",
        "This way you will be able to sew the areas you have pinned when you remove the shirt.",
        "If you are tailoring a button-down shirt, then make sure that you button it up all the way before putting the shirt on.",
        "Pinch the areas where you would like the shirt to fit better.",
        "Locate the areas of the shirt where it is ill-fitting and pinch them so that they will be the size you\u2019d like them to be.",
        "Then, place a pin through the fabric in each of these areas to hold the fabric in place.",
        "You may also ask a friend to do this for you if you find it difficult to pinch and pin the shirt you are wearing.",
        "Remove the shirt.",
        "When you finish pinning the shirt in all of the areas where the fit is off, carefully take off the shirt.",
        "Make sure that you do this carefully and slowly to avoid removing any of the pins in the process.",
        "Sew along the edges of the pinned areas.",
        "To secure the fabric in the areas you have pinned, sew a straight stitch just outside of the areas you have pinned.",
        "Remove the pins as you sew.",
        "Cut away the excess fabric.",
        "When you finish sewing along the pinned areas, you will need to cut away the excess fabric that is outside of the seam.",
        "Cut about \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) from the new seam to remove the excess fabric.",
        "After you cut away the excess fabric, your shirt will be ready to wear.",
        "Turn it right side out and try it on!"
