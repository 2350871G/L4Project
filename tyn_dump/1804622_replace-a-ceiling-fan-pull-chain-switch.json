Use a screwdriver to take out these screws, loosening the fixture to see the wiring and switch. Set the screws and detachable fixture piece aside in a safe place to reattach them later. Unscrew the nut on the side of the fixture that holds the switch. Look on the outside of the fixture for a small nut. Unscrew this nut to remove it completely, letting you access the ceiling fan pull chain switch. Set the nut aside for safekeeping. Pull out the switch to inspect the chain more closely.

Installing a New Switch Purchase a replacement switch at your local home improvement store. Either take a picture of your old switch so you know which one to purchase, or disassemble the old switch and take it with you. Look for a \u201cfan light switch\u201d or something labeled similarly. Ask an employee at the home improvement or hardware store for help if you\u2019re not sure which switch to buy. Disconnect the wires attached to the old switch.

Use a wire stripper to strip the insulation off of the ends of the wires attached to the new switch, cutting into the insulation with the stripper before pulling it towards the end of the wire to remove it. This will allow the electrical connection to pass through the wires. Twist the wires together and cover them with connectors. Locate the old wires that your new wires will attach to and twist them together tightly using a clockwise motion. Many wires are color-coded, making it easy to match the correct wires together. Cover the bare wire with a twist-on connector, making sure the entire bare wire is covered. Refer to the picture you took of the wires the old switch connected to, if needed. Twist-on connectors are also called wire nuts and can be found at your local hardware store. Put the new switch into the fan housing to reattach the nut on the outside. Since you removed the small nut on the outside of the fixture that holds the switch in place earlier, it's time to reattach it. Hold the switch inside the fixture, and screw the nut back on to the outside of the fixture to hold the switch in place. Putting the Fixture Back Together Hold the fixture over the wiring and screw it back into place.

Ask someone to hold the fixture in place while you screw the screws back in, if desired. Put the lightbulbs back into the fixture if needed. If you removed any globes or sconces that went around the bulbs, reattach these first either by twisting them back on or using a screwdriver to reinstall the screws.
