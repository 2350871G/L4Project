However, bear in mind that this can vary depending on the size of your chicken and the layout of your yard. Buy a chicken house from a home hardware store, pet store, or online supplier. Take a look at your yard before buying your chicken house and make sure you have enough room. In addition, a fenced-in yard to let your chicken loose is ideal."
