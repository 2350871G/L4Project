Even though you will be removing the skin from the apple, you should still rinse them to remove any noticeable dirt or grime before you do anything else. Dirt from the skin can get transferred to the flesh of the apple underneath during the peeling process. The apples should be more sweet than sour, so Gala, Fuji, Jonagold, Red Delicious, Melrose, Honeycrisp, and Golden Delicious are good options. For the richest, most complex taste, use a variety of apple types."

These hand-operated devices accomplish all three tasks at once. You secure the apple on the base and rotate the apple against a small blade that peels it.

If you do not have an apple corer, you can either cut around the core with a paring knife or cut the core out of each slice after you cut the apple into slices. There are also combination corer-slicers. This tool has a round center blade that cuts out the core, but it also has smaller straight blades that slice the apple as you press down on it."

Cutting them down into chunks allows you to form slightly smoother applesauce, though."

Some cooks also prefer to add the cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla at the end of the cooking process.
