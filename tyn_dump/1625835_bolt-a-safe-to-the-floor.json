If you are using toggle bolts, which are best for attaching the safe to a wood floor, you will need to drill a bigger hole than the diameter of the bolt to get the toggles through the flooring. In many cases, the toggle bolt packaging will tell you how big the hole needs to be. Use a type of drill bit that is appropriate for your specific type of flooring. For concrete floors and floors covered in tile, you will need a masonry drill bit. For wood or laminate floors you will need a wood drill bit. Ensure that your drill bit is the proper length. Most wood floors are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, so your drill bit needs to be at least that long. For concrete floors, the bolts you use will determine how deep the hole needs to be, and thus hold long the drill bit needs to be. Look at the packaging on your bolts to figure out how deep the holes need to be. If you are unsure of what type and size of drill bit to use, go to your hardware store and ask a sales associate for the right one. Tip: Look at the mounting directions that came with your safe.

        "It's important that all of the holes you drilled are lined up with the holes in the safe.",
        "If a few of them appear lined up and a few don't, keep adjusting.",
        "This will prevent you from having to undo bolts you've already inserted because the safe needs to be readjusted.",
        "Insert the bolts through the base of the safe.",
        "Slide each bolt in one at a time.",
        "Once you put the bolt in the hole, you may need to hammer it 2 or 3 times in order to get it to sit properly all the way in the hole.When inserting a masonry bolt, it's a good idea to screw the nut onto the top of the threads before hammering the bolt into place.",
        "This will preserve the threads on the top of the bolt, making sure the nut can be screwed on and off easily.",
        "If you are using a toggle bolt, which has a nut with wings on it, the toggle may not fit through the hole.",
        "You may need to insert the bolt through the hole and then tilt the safe so that you can attach the toggle to the bolt on the underside of the safe.",
        "If the toggle fits through the hole in the safe, you will fold the wings in so that they fit through the hole.",
        "Once through the hole, they will expand automatically and hold the bolt in place.",
        "Tighten the nut or the screw head on top of the bolt.",
        "Place a washer and a nut on the top of each masonry bolt, if you are using them.",
        "Then use a pair of pliers or a wrench to tighten down the bolt.",
        "If you are using a toggle bolt, use a screwdriver to turn the bolt until it gets tight, which means that the toggle it gripping into the underside of your wood floor.",
        "With both types of bolts, keep turning the nut until it is tight and unable to turn any further.",
        "On a masonry bolt, tightening the nut down will expand the sleeve on the bottom of the bolt.",
        "This will wedge the bolt to the walls of the concrete around it.",
        "Try to move the safe to ensure that it has been bolted successfully.",
        "Once the bolts are tightened, test the safe by pushing on it in a variety of directions.",
        "If it is securely bolted, it should not move at all.",
        "If the safe does move, one or several of your bolts may not be secure.",
        "Wiggle the bolt heads in the safe and see if any of them move freely.",
        "If one does, you need to try to secure it once again."
