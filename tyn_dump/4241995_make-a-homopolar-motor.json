Ensure you\u2019re using wire which is uncoated, nonmagnetic, and somewhat pliable. Coated copper wire is generally made of multiple thin copper filaments woven into a rope-like wire. This type of wire is too weak to maintain a bendable shape, a quality which you\u2019ll want it to have later. The magnet should be a flattened cylinder with a diameter no larger than about one centimeter. Be careful not to let small children play with the magnet.
