Starting at your hairline, take a section of hair about the size of your brush and hold the ends up in the air. Lightly brush the hair back towards the root for 2-3 strokes. Work towards the back of your hair, repeating the process until all of your hair is teased. This teasing method is great for any updo, such as the Gibson Girl. If you\u2019re starting with wet hair, blow-dry it upside down before adding volumizing mousse or powder.
