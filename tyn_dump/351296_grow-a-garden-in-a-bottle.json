Choose your plants before you start assembling your bottle garden so that you can plan for their needs. For example, if you want to grow succulents, you might choose zebra haworthia, hens-and-chicks, and kalanchoe. For a bottle garden with a moister environment, you could go for peace lilies, Fittonia, and Syngonium."

If you choose to reuse a bottle, wash it thoroughly before adding plants. For easier planting, choose a jar or bottle with an opening large enough to allow your hand in.

Allow it to cool before using it for planting. For example, for succulents, try purchasing a fast-draining potting soil designed for cacti.

        "If you\u2019re planting multiple plants, try to leave a little space between them so they have room to spread out.",
        "If your bottle has a narrow opening, you may need to use tongs to insert the plants.",
        "Wrap the plants with paper before putting them in to protect the leaves as they pass through the opening.",
        "Try to position the plants so their foliage doesn\u2019t touch the sides of the bottle, since moisture will tend to accumulate on the interior walls.",
        "Too much moisture can make the leaves rot.",
        "Tamp down the soil around each plant for stability.",
        "Once the plants are in place, pat down the soil around the base of each plant.",
        "If the container has a wide enough opening, you can do this with your fingers.",
        "Otherwise, you will need to use a tool, such as a skewer or stick with a cork on the end.",
        "Patting down the soil will help remove air pockets and improve contact between the roots and the soil.",
        "Fill the spaces between the plants with moss.",
        "You can give your terrarium a prettier, more finished appearance by filling the spaces between the plants.",
        "Try adding a layer of moss from your garden to create a dreamy, fairy garden look.",
        "You can also use peat moss, gravel, polished pebbles, or sand.Tip: If you like, you can decorate with accessories, such as small figurines or glass gems.",
        "Have fun and get creative!",
        "Pour a small amount of water into the bottle so it runs down the sides.",
        "Take a watering can and carefully pour in some water along the inner edge of the bottle.",
        "Try to get the water to trickle along the wall of the bottle so it doesn\u2019t pour directly onto the plants.",
        "Water the soil until it\u2019s damp, but not soggy.",
        "The curved sides of the bottle will help keep the inside of your container nice and moist between waterings.",
        "If you wish, you can put a lid on the bottle to maintain an even more humid environment.",
        "Alternatively, you can mist the plants instead of watering them.",
        "This will help wash off loose potting medium and prevent the soil from getting too sodden, especially if you already moistened it before planting.",
        "Maintaining the Bottle Garden Place your bottle in a well-lit area out of direct sunlight.",
        "Most terrarium plants don\u2019t need direct sun, but they will need some light to grow and stay healthy.",
        "Choose a spot in your home that stays bright but won\u2019t allow in enough sun to scorch your plants.",
        "East-facing windows often work well for this purpose.",
        "You can also use a grow light if your home doesn\u2019t have any suitable windows.",
        "Water your plants when the soil becomes dry.",
        "Check the soil in your bottle garden occasionally to make sure it doesn\u2019t dry out completely.",
        "Mist the plants or add more water as needed.",
        "Most terrarium plants do best if their soil is always slightly moist.",
        "If your bottle terrarium is closed, you probably won\u2019t need to water it for at least 4-6 months.",
        "If you\u2019re growing succulents, let the soil dry out completely between waterings.",
        "Remove any dead or diseased foliage.",
        "During the first few weeks after planting your garden, observe closely for any signs of disease or rot.",
        "Quickly remove any dead or rotting plants or leaves to prevent the spread of disease to other plants in the garden.",
        "Take out and replace any growing medium that has signs of fungus in it, and add a plant fungicide to stop the infection from spreading.",
        "Mold can be a sign of an overly humid environment in the bottle.",
        "If you\u2019re using a closed bottle for your garden, take off the cover for a few weeks to give it a chance to air out, especially if you notice mold along with fog or condensation on the glass.",
        "Prune your plants if they start to get too big.",
        "Plants grown in a bottle garden sometimes need pruning.",
        "If your plants are starting to become too tall for their space, trim them back a little to encourage them to grow out instead of up.",
        "Proactively trim or pinch off just the tips instead of pruning back most of the foliage after the plant has already gotten too tall.",
        "This will encourage healthier growth."
