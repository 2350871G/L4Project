        "Watch the \"lava\" ooze out of the jar.",
        "You can keep adding more vinegar to make the volcano continue \"exploding.\"",
        "When the volcano stops exploding, that means you have run out of baking soda.",
        "Making Lava in a Bag[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Gather your supplies.",
        "Combining water and oil in a bag will create a lava that is fun to squish around.",
        "It can last a long time, as long as you keep the bag sealed.",
        "Here is what you will need:\nZiploc bag (or similar re-sealable bag)\nBaby oil\nGlow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint\nWater Pour baby oil into the Ziploc bag.",
        "How much oil you use will depend on the size of your Ziploc bag.",
        "You will need to fill the bag \u00bc to 1/3 full.",
        "Do not fill the bag all the way.",
        "You can also use olive oil or another pale-colored oil.",
        "Baby oil, however, is clear and will allow you to see the lava's colors at their best.",
        "Prepare your lava.",
        "In a small cup, combine 1 part paint and 1 part hot water.",
        "Stir until everything is combined.",
        "You can use glow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint.",
        "This will make your lava.",
        "You can use any color you like, but reds, oranges, yellows, and pinks will create the most realistic-looking lava.",
        "Consider adding some glitter to make your lava sparkly.",
        "Add the lava to the bag.",
        "You will need 1 to 4 tablespoons of lava.",
        "Simply measure out the lava and add it to the bag.",
        "The lava will not mix with the oil, but form globs instead.",
        "Seal the bag tightly.",
        "Close the bag partway, and squeeze out as much air as possible before closing the bag the rest of the way.",
        "There should be little to no air inside the bag.",
        "Make sure that the bag is tightly sealed.",
        "You can put clear packaging tape over the top of the bag so that it does not open.",
        "Play with your lava.",
        "You can play with your lava by taking the bag into a dark room, and squishing the bag around with your fingers.",
        "The globs of paint will move around!",
        "Do not open the bag, or the lava will escape!",
        "If you made glow-in-the-dark lava, you will need to charge your lava by leaving it in the sun or under a bright lamp for a few minutes.",
        "If you made fluorescent lava, you will need to use a black light.",
        "Simply turn off the regular lights and switch on your black light.",
        "The fluorescent lava will then glow.",
        "Making a Lava Lamp[5]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Gather your materials.",
        "In this project, you will be using Alka-Seltzer and water to create a lava-lamp effect.",
        "Here is what you will need:\nA bottle, jar, or tall glass\nBaby oil\nWater\nFood coloring\nAlka-Seltzer or an antacid tablet Choose a container for your lava.",
        "You can make your lava lamp in a bottle, jar, or a tall glass.",
        "If you use a bottle or jar, however, you will be able to seal your lava lamp and use it again and again by swirling the liquid around inside.",
        "Fill the jar 2/3 of the way with baby oil.",
        "If you do not have baby oil, you can use olive oil or another pale-colored oil instead.",
        "Baby oil, however, is clear and will let you see the colors of the lava better.",
        "Pour the water on top of the oil.",
        "Do not fill your container all the way.",
        "Instead, leave about 1 inch of space between the water and the top of the jar.",
        "Add a few drops of food coloring.",
        "This will make the lava more visible.",
        "You can use any color you want, but reds, oranges, and yellows will create the most lava-like effect.",
        "You can only use one color however; if you use all three colors, they will mix together and make orange.",
        "Wait for the lava to settle.",
        "After a few minutes, the water and food coloring will sink to the bottom of the jar, and the oil will float to the top.",
        "The food coloring will mix into the water by itself when it sinks to the bottom of the jar.",
        "Break the Alka-Seltzer into smaller pieces.",
        "You can break the tablet in half, or you can break it into fourths.",
        "Drop the Alka-Seltzer into the jar.",
        "The Alka-Seltzer will sink to the bottom, and cause the colored water to bubble and fizz.",
        "The bubbles will float to the top of the jar, creating a lava lamp-like effect.",
        "You can drop another piece of Alka-Seltzer to create more bubbles.",
        "Consider keeping your lava lamp.",
        "When you have run out of Alka-Seltzer, you can still continue using your lava by putting the lid on the jar or a cap on the bottle.",
        "If you used a glass, you can pour everything into a jar or bottle.",
        "Gently turn the jar upside down and back and forth.",
        "The colored water will come together into a large glob (o several smaller goblets) and float in the oil.",
        "It will look like lava!",
        "If you used a bottle, simply twist the cap onto the bottle.",
        "If you made your lava lamp in a cup, you can pour the liquid into a jar of bottle using a funnel, and then close the jar or bottle tightly."
