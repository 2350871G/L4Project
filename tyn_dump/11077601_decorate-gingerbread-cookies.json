                    "description": "For a simple icing that comes together quickly, stir 2 cups (250 g) of powdered sugar with \u20444 cup (59 ml) of milk and 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla extract. This will make a thin, smooth icing that's easy to squirt or drizzle.Variation: To give the icing a slight citrus flavor that pairs well with gingerbread, substitute orange juice for the milk. If you'd like to make the icing a little thicker, just stir in powdered sugar until it's the texture you want."

Gradually beat in 4 cups (500 g) of powdered sugar on medium-low speed for 3 to 5 minutes so the icing becomes thick, smooth, and shiny. If you don't want to use pasteurized egg whites, try making the royal icing with 3 tablespoons (30 g) of meringue powder and \u20442 cup (120 ml) of warm water instead."

Divide your icing into several small bowls and then mix food dye into each one until they're the colors you want. Add the food coloring gradually so you don't accidentally make the icing darker than you'd like. Keep in mind that it's difficult to make bright red using liquid food coloring, so consider using a gel paste or powdered food coloring to this color."

Flooding is a popular decorating technique where you pipe a line of royal icing along the edges of a cookie.
