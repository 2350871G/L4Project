This can include military-oriented days of celebration, like Veterans Day and Memorial Day in the United States or Remembrance Day in Canada. Other ceremonial events that you can wear medals at include parades, military presentations, general veterans or military meetings, and funerals. You should only wear medals on civilian clothes when those clothes are still formal attire. Do not wear medals on casual civilian clothes, even during a military event."

                    "description": "You can wear your full size medals, miniature medals, or lapel pins. Each option can be appropriate. Enameled lapel pins represent a single medal or decoration. In the United States, there are lapel pins that represent every medal and many award ribbons. Usually, you only wear one lapel pin, and that pin can represent either your highest award or an award that has special meaning to you. Lapel pins are only worn on the lapel of a blazer. For more formal attire, full size or miniature medals are usually more appropriate. Each full size medal has an equivalent miniature medal. Miniature medals create a less cluttered appearance, but the choice between full size and miniature medals is entirely a personal one. While it is not a rule, miniature medals are usually worn during very formal events, especially those held in the evening and requiring full evening dress or dinner dress. Full size medals are most typically worn on morning dress or formal daytime attire."

The remaining medals should be worn in order of seniority, with the least senior medal on the left side of the bar, nearest the left shoulder. Commemorative or nonofficial awards, when worn, should be placed on the right side. You can only wear one row of medals.

The overall length when measured from the top of the ribbon to the bottom of the medal should be 4 inches (10 cm), however. The bottom edge of each medal should be aligned with the other medals. Run the medal ribbon through the ring or clasp on the medal. This clasp should be in the middle of the ribbon.
