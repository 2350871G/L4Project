In this case, you\u2019ll be parboiling the carrots to make them firmer, and thus easier to sear in the pan when you go to saut\u00e9 them. After the water has reached a rolling boil, toss in the carrots, and boil them as you normally would. As they cook, make sure their texture remains even crisper than an al dente bite. When they\u2019re done, strain the carrots from the water, but leave them in the pot until they\u2019re ready to be added to the pan for saut\u00e9ing.

Boil water in a pot. Fill a pot with water and start heating it on the stove. Use just enough water to cover the carrots you\u2019ll be cooking, and bring it to a rolling boil.
