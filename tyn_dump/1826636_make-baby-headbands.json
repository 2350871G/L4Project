This can be done by measuring the individual or by using generalized measurements based on age or weight. If measuring in person, you will want to measure the circumference of the head, in roughly the same place that you intend the headband to go. This will usually be just above the ears. Methods. Babies are fragile and do not like to hold still, so taking their measurements can be challenging. If you have a cloth measuring tape, use this. Avoid metal measuring tapes as they are inaccurate and may scratch the baby. If a cloth measuring tape is unavailable, measure the head using a length of soft string and then comparing the string to another measurement tool. If the baby is not located nearby or if the baby has not yet been born, you may have to rely on generalized measurements. These can be found readily on the internet. Try searching for standard sizes on sewing and craft websites and message boards. It may also be possible to find another child of a similar size or age and measure their head."

This will largely depend on the size of the baby who will wear the headband, as a too-wide band will not conform to the head and simply slip off. A newborn will likely not be able to wear a band much wider than half an inch. A six-month to one-year-old baby will probably be able to wear a one inch band. A toddler will probably be able to wear a two inch band. You may wish to test first before deciding. This can be done by cutting scrap fabric to try to visually guess the correct width or by having your baby try store-bought bands first to find the proper size."

Stretch jersey, velvet, or lace are best suited to infant headbands. This material should form the band itself.

If you choose to use a fabric like stretch lace, however, doubling will be unnecessary. For jersey, velvet and other full fabrics, you will want to cut the material in a long rectangular shape, in order to be able to eventually form a tube. First, cut the length (using the head measurement taken earlier) so that there is a quarter to half-inch seam allowance on either end. Cut the width so that it is twice the size you decided on, as well as another quarter to half-inch extra seam allowance. These seam allowances should be on all sides. Use appropriate tools. Using sewing shears is very important when you cut the fabric, as dull blades can lead to an uneven, unattractive edge."

Make it as even as possible but since it is made of stretch fabric, most imperfections will be hidden naturally. Fold the rectangle of fabric. If you\u2019ve chosen to use stretch lace, this will be unnecessary. If using other materials, fold it lengthwise so that the wrong side is facing outwards. Pin the material using straight pins, so that the long edges are in line with each other. Straight pins should be placed perpendicular to the long side of the fabric. This will keep your sewing machine from catching on a pin if you forget to remove one. It will also make it possible to sew right over the pins as well. Sew the length of the material, leaving your quarter to half-inch seam allowance and the ends open. Use a stitch and sewing machine needle appropriate to the material you have chosen. Stretchy fabrics will require a ball-point needle and a stretch or zigzag stitch. For plain cotton a normal needle and straight stitch should suffice. The same methods can be done by hand but will be more time consuming. Reverse the fabric. This can be done simply by hand but it may be easier to use basic tools. The most common method is to use a small safety-pin. Pin it at the end of the tub in such a way that the dead of the pin is inside the tube. Begin pulling small sections of fabric over the pin and pushing the head down the length of the tube. This takes time but is fair simple. When you are done you may wish to iron the tube flat, to create more of a band appearance. You may also wish to forgo ironing, in favor of a looser, draped look."

Feed the elastic through the tube. This will be easiest if you place a safety-pin at one end of the elastic and use that to guide you. Make sure that as you pull the elastic through the tube, the elastic remains flat. Sew the two ends of the elastic together by hand or by machine. A zigzag or x-shaped stitch is good for this. Be sure that the elastic is flat and did not twist inside the tube. Close the tube. While it is possible to use your machine, this step works best when using hand stitching. Tuck the ends of the fabric inward as much as possible. Use careful, small whip stitches to join the ends of the tube together. If you do not want to sew by hand, close the tube with your machine, overlapping the fabric and sewing a line down the back. This method will be more visible that hand-stitching.

Choose a ribbon that compliments the color of the band you have just created and appeals to your personal taste. There are several different types of bow. You can make one which is simple, like those used to tie shoes, or you can make one that is more complex, like those bought to go on presents. For the simple bow, tie a bow as normal. Take an extra inch or two of ribbon and wrap it around the center of the bow to hide the knot. Glue or sew this unto the band. For a more complex bow, take a roll of ribbon. Holding the end down, make a loop about two inches long and then hold that down. Reverse and do the same thing on the other side. Reverse and repeat until your bow looks full.

        "Try to get fabric ribbon, as plastic ribbon is not good for this purpose.",
        "Choose a ribbon that compliments the color of the band you have just created and appeals to your personal taste.",
        "There are several different types of bow.",
        "You can make one which is simple, like those used to tie shoes, or you can make one that is more complex, like those bought to go on presents.",
        "For the simple bow, tie a bow as normal.",
        "Take an extra inch or two of ribbon and wrap it around the center of the bow to hide the knot.",
        "Glue or sew this unto the band.",
        "For a more complex bow, take a roll of ribbon.",
        "Holding the end down, make a loop about two inches long and then hold that down.",
        "Reverse and do the same thing on the other side.",
        "Reverse and repeat until your bow looks full.",
        "Use a single stitch to keep it in place and then cover the center as before.",

        "Make a flower.",
        "You may wish to go for a more floral look with your headband.",
        "This is a great look for little girls and will give her a fairy-like appearance.",

        "Begin with foot-long, one inch wide strips of fabric.",
        "Try to use fabric which is contrasting but complementary to the band you have sewn.",
        "Any fabric type will do, including basic cottons.",
        "Glue this fabric around a pipe cleaner in a slightly uneven way.",
        "This will give the material a draped look.",
        "Roll the pipe cleaner into a rosette shape.",
        "If you are only using one, it may be possible to then glue the flower directly to your band.",
        "Otherwise, glue the flower or flowers into an arrangement on a piece of felt.",
        "Cut the felt to ensure that it is not visible when looking at the flowers from above and then glue the felt to the band.",
        "Use sequins.",
        "For a more fabulous look, you can use sequins.",
        "These are easy to use and do not require you to make anything extra.",
        "They come in a variety of colors and sizes and can be attached to your band to create many different patterns.",
        "Try using varying sizes of the same color to achieve a different look.",
        "Sequins can be sew on individually by stitching through the hole at the center or they can be glued to the band.",

        "This can be a great way to let your little girl\u2019s personality shine through.",
        "Choose items which tell people who she is.",
        "Stars, hearts, animals, or food items all make good shapes to put on the band.",
        "You can make these shapes yourself, using felt.",
        "You can simply create the shape and cut it from one or more pieces of felt and glue that to the band, or you can use felting to create a 3D object to glue or stitch to the band.",
        "It simply depends on your skill and desire.",
        "You can also use novelty buttons or scrapbooking decorations to embellish your headband.",
        "Glue or sew these as necessary."
