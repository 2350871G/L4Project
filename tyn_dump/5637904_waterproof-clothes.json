    "text": " Method 1: Using Wax and Linseed Oil Purchase equal amounts of beeswax and linseed oil. You will also need a brush for painting on the mixture. Linseed oil has a very strong and unpleasant odor, but it is effective at waterproofing clothing. Melt the linseed oil and beeswax. Do not worry about melting them at a certain temperature, you just want to make sure the wax is melted and combined with the linseed oil. Test the solution on a scrap piece of clothing. Let the test piece air dry and note how much time it took for the particular smell of linseed oil to evaporate. You should also check if the wax changes the color or appearance of the clothing. Long-term exposure to unpleasant smells can cause headaches for some children so make sure the mixture is very dry and the linseed smell has faded before you give the clothing to your child. Spread out the clothes you are going to waterproof. You can do this in your backyard or in your garage. You can also set up a work area inside your home if you do not have a yard or if weather conditions do not permit you to be outside. Make sure you protect the surface you are working on with old newspapers or old clothing. Choose a well ventilated area in your home, preferably a room with windows you can open to air out the smell. Apply the solution evenly with a brush to the clothing. Once you have covered all of the clothing with the solution, let the clothes air dry, preferably inside. If you dry the clothes outside, dust and dirt could stick to the clothes. The drying process can take 2-4 days. Once dry, there should be no traces of the solution when you touch the clothing. Method 2: Applying Beeswax Purchase a piece of wax, preferably natural, such as beeswax. You can also use paraffin wax, as it is colorless and will work as a waterproofing agent, but it could have toxic fumes as it is a petroleum product. So, it may not be the best choice for waterproofing your child\u2019s clothing. If you use paraffin wax, make sure you do so in a well ventilated room or outside. Prepare a work surface by covering it with old newspaper or clothing. Then, spread out the clothing you are going to waterproof on your work surface. Take a piece of wax and rub it directly on the clothing. To make the wax easier to apply, you can put it in a sunny spot to soften it or place it close to a heat source, such as a radiator, heater, or stove. The wax does not need to melt, but only become a bit soft. You can also warm up the clothes to make it easier to apply the wax. Heat them up by throwing them in the dryer for a quick cycle, by using a hair dryer or by ironing them. Use the edge of the piece of wax to get into small areas on the clothing. You want to be sure the entire surface of the clothing is covered evenly in wax so make sure you get wax on areas around buttons, zippers, and the edges of the clothing. You can also use your fingers to apply the wax and get it on any hard to reach areas. Let the clothes dry for at least two days. The wax can leave an unpleasant odor, so to make the wax evaporate faster, you can put the clothes in the freezer overnight. Method 3: Using a Waterproof Spray Purchase a waterproof spray. There are several types of waterproof sprays available, so choose one that is designed for clothes that are not waterproof. Most of these sprays are made with a base of silicon or fluoropolymer. Prepare your indoor work area by laying down old newspaper and clothing. It is best to apply the spray in a room. Factors like wind can make it hard to control the spray if you are working outside. Wash and dry the clothing and then spread it on your work area. Do this to avoid making sturdy stains on the clothing when you apply the spray. Start by spraying the inner surface of the clothing. This way, you can see how it will affect the fabric. If it does not cause a lot of discoloration, continue to spray the entire inner surface of the clothing. Spray the rest of the clothing. Hold the spray 6\u20138 inches (15.2\u201320.3 cm) from the clothing and try to spray it evenly. Method 4: Using Laundry Detergent and Aluminum Potassium Sulfate Gather your materials. You will need standard laundry detergent and aluminum potassium sulfate, or alum. You can purchase alum at your local grocery store or online. Prepare your work area by laying down old newspapers. You can use this method indoors or outdoors. Dissolve 2 cups of laundry detergent in 8 liters (2.1 US gal) of warm water. Stir it until all of the detergent dissolves. Soak the clothes in this solution until they are completely and evenly wet. Then, remove them and let them air dry completely. Make a solution of 1 cup of alum and 8 liters (2.1 US gal) of warm water. Stir this solution until the alum dissolves completely. Soak the clothes in this solution for several hours or overnight. Remove them from the solution the next day and let them air dry. The clothes should be immersed in a solution of alum in water at a ratio of 1:10 (1 part alum to 10 parts water). The alum causes a chemical reaction to occur on the clothing, resulting in a deposit of alum on the fibers of the clothing (coating the individual fibers within the yarn), and waterproofing it. Test the waterproofed clothing after using any of these methods. To do this, simply wet the clothes. If you notice the appearance of beads of water on the clothing, this means that clothes do not absorb water and are waterproof. If there are any dark stains on the clothing, the fabric has absorbed the water and the clothes are not waterproof. If this occurs, repeat your chosen waterproofing method or try a different method.",
