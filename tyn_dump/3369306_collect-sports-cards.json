        "If you're in a hurry to get rid of a mass of unwanted cards, gather them up and drop them off in bulk at a pawn shop or secondhand store.",
        "You may not get much for them, but a few bucks is better than nothing, especially if they've just been sitting around in your attic for years.",
        "If you decide you don't want to part with your cards after all, you'll have a small window of time during which you can return the money your received and get them back."
