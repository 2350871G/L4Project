    "text": " Ironing Your Cards Place a heat-safe cloth over the cards. Because paper cards are flammable, an iron can burn or even set fire to your cards. Laminated cards can also melt under extreme heat. Use a cloth (like an ironing pad or old tee shirt) as a barrier between the cards and your iron. Set your iron based on the material of your cloth. Your iron setting will vary based on what you use to cover the cards. The higher the heat resistance, the hotter the temperature setting your cloth can withstand. Fabrics with high heat resistance include: linen, denim, cotton, polyester, rayon, and silk. Fabrics with low heat resistance (to avoid) include: wool, acetate, acrylic, nylon, and spandex. Avoid using your iron's steam setting. Trading cards are prone to water damage. As humidity often causes bending, using steam to iron your cards will lower their quality and value. Double-check that you have turned off this setting before you begin. Iron the cards repeatedly until flat. Once you've secured the cards under the heat-safe cloth, you're ready to iron. Move your iron back and forth across the bent cards to evenly spread the heat. After about thirty seconds, remove the cards from under the cloth to check their progress. Continue this process until your cards are no longer bent. Blow Drying Your Cards Place your card on a flat surface. Lay your card face down so it's curving into the surface rather than outward. Creased cards can be resistant to bending back in shape. Keeping the card face-down will help guide it back into shape. Turn your blow dryer to a hot setting. Heat will remove humidity from the card and press out stubborn creases. Choose the hottest setting when blow drying your cards. Blow dryers do not get as hot as irons (nor do they touch the card directly), so you do not need a barrier between it and the trading cards. Blow dry evenly for about thirty seconds. Move your blow dryer back and forth over the bent cards. If your cards blow away, hold them down with your hand. Your dryer should be close to the cards but not touching. After half a minute has passed, inspect your cards for remaining creases. Continue blow drying until your cards are flat. Your cards might not regain their shape after the first try. Keep blow drying your cards in thirty second increments, checking their progress as time passes. If your cards remain bent after several minutes, try another method. Steaming Your Cards Boil water over your stove. For the water to steam, you will need it boiling hot. Add tap water into a pan and heat it over your stove. Wait until bubbles are breaking the surface and your pan emits steam. Place a lid over the pan to trap the steam until you can move it to a bowl. Turn off the stove once it starts boiling. Pour the water into a heat-resistant bowl. The bowl you use will need to hold boiling water without warping. Some plastic bowls cannot hold water. Make sure the container you use is heat-resistant. Use glass, ceramic, or porcelain bowls for added protection. Take caution while pouring to avoid burning your hands. Place plastic wrap over the bowl. Pan lids will neither fit over your bowl nor allow enough heat through to warm your cards. Apply a piece of saran wrap large enough to cover the entire top of your bowl. Within a few seconds, you should see condensation forming. Put your card on top of the wrap. After tightly wrapping the bowl, place your card directly on top (face down). Monitor the card for thirty seconds to one minute, then check the card for creases. Repeat this step until your card is no longer bent.",
