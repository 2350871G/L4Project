If you have a food processor, use it to mince up the fresh horseradish. If not, use a clean cutting board and sharp knife to finely mince the root. The finer the mince, the more flavorful your dip will be. Fresh horseradish can be super pungent and can irritate your nose and eyes, so avoid touching your face after handling it. Open a window if the scent gets to be too strong. If you don\u2019t have access to fresh horseradish, you can also use the jarred and preserved variety you find at the grocery store.
