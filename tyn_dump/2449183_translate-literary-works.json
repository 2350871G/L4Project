            "description": "Translating creative works requires the ability to read between the lines. You have to love reading in the genre(s) you're translating and be both intimate with the writer and the nuances of language, culture, thought, and message. If, for instance, you translate prose poems from Dutch into English, you have to read as many published (and unpublished) prose poems as possible, in Dutch and in English. This will help you to grasp the styles, the subtleties, the contexts, and soul of prose poetry in order to deconstruct the Dutch and reconstruct the English. Remember to keep on top of your languages. Language is a fluid entity that constantly changes and evolves. Dialects change, semantics change, new words are coined, old words die and are reborn."

            "description": "Most literary translators, with very few exceptions, translate exclusively into their mother tongue, the language within best they express themselves and are most at home in. To translate a book, you have to write a book; to translate a play, you need to know how to write a play. The only way you can do this is write as much as possible in your language and continuously hone that skill. Most published translators are also published writers. A rare exception to the rule was Israel's Leah Goldberg (1911 - 1970). She was European raised and educated, yet translated exclusively into Modern Hebrew, her third language, from six other languages. She however adopted Hebrew as her home and vehicle of expression and was a prolific writer exclusively in Hebrew as well."

Consider getting at least one degree in comparative literature, linguistics, languages, or translation to give you a head start. Literary translation specifically is often offered through creative writing programs. Receiving academic training will also give you access to literary lectures, mentor ships with professors who translate, and libraries with well-established and worldly collections. If academia is out of your league, you can teach yourself through books. Check out your local book shops and libraries on what is published on the subject and read, read, read.

It is your job not to find an equivalent but rather reconstruct the original as though it was written in the target language. Cultural concepts, shades of colour, shades of meaning, and even history can and will be lost. Don't be afraid of that but instead embrace it. You can always use footnotes / end notes if necessary. Who is your audience? Proofread the translated finished parts one by one before the general read and review at the end. You might find a better word or an expression in the same language that gets the exact meaning of the other. Do not over process, but check to see where can you install your enhancements."
