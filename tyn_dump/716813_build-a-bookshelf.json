Measure the space where the bookshelf will sit. Decide how tall you want the finished shelf unit to be and how wide. Bookshelves are traditionally 12\" or 16\" deep; of course, you can customize to suit your needs. Decide if your bookshelf will have an open or a closed back. If you keep the back open, your books may lean on or touch the wall behind the bookshelf. Decide it you'll use it to house paperback, hardback or coffee table-sized books. For maximum versatility, this project uses adjustable shelving so any size book will fit. Standard bookshelves come in two-, three-, four- and five-shelf varieties, but you can make as many shelves as you want for your project."

        "Attach it with glue and 2\" wood screws.",
        "Put the center and bottom shelves in place.",
        "Once the top of the bookshelf is secure, attach the bottom shelf.",
        "Apply wood glue to the support blocks for the bottom shelf and set the shelf in position.",
        "Drill and countersink pilot holes in the side of the bookshelf and attach the shelf with 2\" wood screws.",
        "If you decided to use support blocks for the center shelf as well, install it now as you did the bottom shelf.",

        "Use a hand block and/or pad sander to cover 100% of the surface with even pressure.",
