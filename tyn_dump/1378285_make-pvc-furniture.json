Use a tape measure for correct measurements. Keeping the blade straight for an even cut, saw through the pipe with a hacksaw or an electric reciprocating saw.

PVC tables and chairs can then be introduced to your guests at an outdoor party or summer gathering. Cut notches in the corners of a water resistant portion of plywood to accommodate the pipes on the frames of the chairs. Woven fabric can be attached to the PVC by looping around the front and back of the chair frame and sewing the end of the fabric together. Your PVC table surface can be made of wood, as well. Teak or other rot-resistant wood should be used for outdoors. Simply cut to fit on top of frame. For more stability, bolt the table top down by drilling holes through wood and the PVC frame, using bolts, washers and nuts. Tighten firmly with adjustable wrench."
