While some suggest using a coarse grind, others recommend making a very fine, powder-like ground. Experiment and see what suits your taste. Crush the cardamom pods. You can use a mortar and pestle to do this, or the back of a spoon. Grind the cardamom seeds. Take the seeds from the pods and put them in a coffee grinder. Grind them into a fine powder. Preheat a thermos. If you plan to serve the coffee from a thermos, as is traditionally done in the Middle East, preheat it now by filling it with boiling water. Making the Coffee Heat the water in the dallah. Use all 3 cups of water and bring to a boil on medium heat. If you don't have a dallah, you can use a saucepan or Turkish cezve. Remove the dallah from the stove for 30 seconds. Let it stand and cool just slightly. Meanwhile, reduce the heat on the burner to low. Add the coffee to the water and return to the stove. You do not need to stir the coffee at this point, since the boiling itself mixes the grounds in the water. Let the coffee brew on low heat.

You can also add a few cloves at this point, if you're using them. Return the coffee to the stove and bring it nearly to a boil again. This process will create the same foam as shown in prior steps. Remove the coffee from the stove and let it stand for 5 minutes. The grounds will settle to the bottom. Prepare your thermos. Empty the boiling water used for preheating. If you are using saffron and/or rosewater, add them now to the empty thermos. Pour the coffee into the thermos until the grounds start coming out. Once you see grounds in the coffee, stop pouring. A small amount of coffee with grounds will remain at the bottom of the dallah. You can pour the coffee through a strainer if you wish.

Milk is not added to Arabic coffee. If you prefer adding milk to yours, keep in mind that light roasts in particular are best without milk. Drinking Arabic Coffee Use your right hand to pour, receive and drink the coffee. It is considered rude to drink with your left hand. Offer multiple servings. A guest should always accept at least one cup, and it is customary to drink at least three over the course of a visit. Swirl your cup to indicate that you've finished.
