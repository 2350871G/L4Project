A cheaper alternative is acid-free tissue paper which, while not preventing the spread of acid between pages, does reduce the risk of increasing the acidity of the newspaper."

Lists of available conservators can be found at the website of the American Institute of Conservation. Additionally, there are products available for de-acidifying old documents, such as Archival Mist spray.
