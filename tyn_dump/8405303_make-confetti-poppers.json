If you have some extra paper hanging off one end of your roll, use your scissors to cut it. Then fold the paper inside the tube and use tape to fasten it there.

Traditional confetti may be too light for this kind of popper. If this is the case for you, try using sequins instead. Producing a Push Action Popper Cut a straight line from end to end on a toilet paper roll. Use scissors to cut a straight line from end to end on one of your toilet paper rolls. Then use hot glue to attach a sturdy paper straw or wooden dowel to the center of your bottle cap. Allow the glue to dry. Check the size of the confetti pusher and assemble it. Open your slit toilet paper roll and position the lid so it is \u00be of the way to one end of the roll, with the straw/dowel exiting the other end of the roll.

Decorate your uncut roll. Cover the outside of your uncut roll with decorative paper to cover the plain cardboard. Attach the paper with either a glue stick or tape. Once the glue is dry, use your glue stick or tape to attach a taut layer of tissue paper at one end of the roll. Load your confetti into the uncut roll. Hold your uncut roll so the tissue paper covered end is upside down. Add confetti to this roll, then gently insert the confetti pusher into the open end of the uncut roll until it is \u00bc to \u00bd of the way inside. You may need to wiggle the pusher back and forth to position it properly inside the uncut roll. Be careful not to use too much force, as it could break your tissue paper seal and release the confetti. Launch your confetti. When the moment comes for you to launch the confetti, in a rapid motion, pull back on the straw/dowel of the confetti pusher slightly, then push it forward firmly. This should cause the tissue paper to break and confetti to fly out of the popper. Using a Push Pop for a Confetti Popper Remove the lid of your push pop container. These containers can be found at most craft stores, but can also be purchased online. After you remove the lid from your push pop container, slide the bottom all the way down so the body of the container is hollow. After you have removed the lid, this can be thrown away.

This can be done easily by wrapping the outside of the popper with decorative paper and taping or gluing this in place. However, you could also paint the outside of the popper, draw designs on it, or personalize it however you wish. Fire your confetti hand cannon. When you're ready to launch your confetti mixture into the air, push the stick end of the push pop container upward in a quick, firm motion. This should cause the tissue paper to pop, and the confetti to explode outwards. Finished. ",
