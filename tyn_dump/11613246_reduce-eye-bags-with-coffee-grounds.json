If the coffee isn\u2019t moist, then it won\u2019t adhere to your skin very well. Coffee powder can also work for this treatment! If you\u2019re using instant coffee packets, 1 sachet should do the trick.Tip: If you don\u2019t feel like adding any other ingredients to your coffee mask, consider setting your plain grounds in the refrigerator for 15 minutes! Cooler grounds are especially useful in reducing under eye puffiness."
