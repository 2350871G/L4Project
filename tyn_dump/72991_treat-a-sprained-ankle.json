                    "description": "Sprains come in 3 grades. A grade 1 sprain has slight tearing of the ligaments, and will result in mild tenderness and swelling. A grade 2 sprain has partial ligament tearing,and moderate tenderness and swelling. A grade 3 sprain is a complete tear of the ligament, and will have significant swelling and tenderness around the ankle. A grade 1 sprain usually does not require medical attention. A grade 3 sprain should almost always be seen by a doctor to make sure there is no other damage to the ankle. Home treatment and management for all 3 grades is the same, but the higher the grade the longer it will take for the ankle to heal."

If your sprain prevents you from comfortably putting weight on your ankle for more than a day, or if you experience severe pain and swelling, call your doctor to make an appointment as soon as possible."

Try not to put weight on the ankle either. If necessary, use crutches to help distribute your weight and keep your balance when you walk. You may consider using an elastic ankle brace as well. Braces add stability and can help control swelling while the ligaments are healing. Depending on the severity of the sprain, you may need the brace for 2-6 weeks."

                    "description": "Wrap a handful of ice, an ice pack, or a bag of frozen peas in a dish towel or a thin piece of cloth. Apply the ice compress to the injured ankle, and hold it there for 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat this every 2-3 hours for as long as swelling persists. Apply ice to your ankle even if you plan to go to the doctor. Ice limits inflammation, especially during the first 24 hours of the injury. Applying ice to any sprain will help reduce overall swelling and bruising. Alternatively, you can fill a bucket with ice water and immerse your foot and ankle. Leave the ice off at least 20-30 minutes between applications. Too much exposure to the ice could lead to frostbite. If you have diabetes or circulation issues, talk to your doctor before applying ice."

Wrap the bandage around the ankle and foot, and secure it with metal fasteners or medical tape. Be sure to keep the wrap dry by removing the bandage when you are icing your ankle, and reapplying it after you remove the ice. Wrap an elastic bandage from your toes to your mid-calf, using even pressure. Keep the bandage on until the swelling subsides. Loosen the wraps if your toes turn blue, feel cold or begin to feel numb. You don't want the wrap to be too loose, but you don't want it to be too tight, either. You can also get slip-up or pull-up style bandages and braces. These are often beneficial because they ensure the even application of pressure without cutting off circulation to your foot."
