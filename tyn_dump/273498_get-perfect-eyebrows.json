To figure out where your inner brows should start, use the following technique:\nAs a general starting point, take a pencil or other long, thin instrument and line it up with the inside corner of your eye. The place where the instrument overlaps your brow is where it should begin. Mark the spot by making a dot there with an eyeliner pencil. Repeat on the other side.
