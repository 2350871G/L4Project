Try:\nGet lots of sleep. You'll need to get the right amount of sleep for your body if you want your brain to work at its best. You should feel alert through most of the day. If you find yourself needing to shut your eyes by lunch, you're not sleeping enough. For most people, you'll need about 8 hours of sleep. Your body can't work right if all you eat is junk like chips, candy, and hamburgers. If you want to be the best student you can be, eat your vegetables (like broccoli), some fruit, and lean proteins (like chicken and fish). Drink plenty of water. Your brain needs water in order to work right. In fact, your whole body needs water in order to work right. Drink several glasses of water a day but keep in mind that some people need more water than others."

                    "description": "Everyone learns best in different ways; this is called a learning style. Find a way that works for you and try to learn that way as much as you can. You'll have more control over this when you study at home, but you can also talk to your teacher about adjusting how the lessons are taught to include more variety for different style learners. For example, have you noticed that it's really easy for you to remember charts or pictures? This means you might be a visual learner, which means you should use more images and pictures in order to learn. An example of this would be if you drew yourself a chart to memorize the parts of speech. Maybe you've noticed that you have an easier time studying when you listen to music quietly or that you can't remember what your teacher wrote on the board but you can \"hear\" what they said in your head as if they were in the room now. This means you might be an auditory learner, which means you learn better with sound. An example of this would be if you record your teacher when they're talking so that you can listen to it while you do your homework or study. Maybe you've noticed that, during a lesson, you feel like you still want to pay attention but you really need to stand up or move around. Maybe you pace around your room while you study. This might mean that you are a kinesthetic learner, which means you learn better when you're doing things with your body. Try playing with a piece of clay in your hand while your teacher talks."

If you get distracted you might miss important information and you'll have a harder time understanding what to do or when you have to study later. If you're having trouble staying focused when your teacher is talking, try sitting in the front and participating more in the class.

You should aim to make your homework marks the highest in the class or you're not really trying to be the best in your class. Beyond that, do as well on your homework as you can. When you don't understand it, ask someone for help! Your teacher might be able to set you up with a tutor or even help you themselves. Schedule enough time to actually get your homework done. This might mean watching less TV or spending less time with your friends but it will be worth it in the end. Getting a good environment to do homework will really help you to get it done. Go somewhere quiet where you don't have any distractions. If you can go to a library, that's a good spot. If you can't leave your house and the people you live with are noisy, try your bedroom."

Pursuing information in a way that follows your interests can also help you stay focused in class. Look for more ways to learn about all of the subjects you study and you'll find that all of the school is more interesting and that you're more and more successful. For example, if you're studying American history, you can watch documentaries online to learn even more about the era you're learning about. You can learn by studying books from your local library and you can also learn a lot online. While Wikipedia isn't always accurate, it's usually pretty good. You can also find documentaries and educational videos on YouTube, like the popular shows Crash Course and TedTalks. These have a lot of information that your teacher or professor didn't explain it well enough for you. Learn when school is out of session too. Keep learning during the summer, on the weekends, and start preparing for your next year of school as early as you can by finding out what kind of stuff you'll study. As for the summers, just reviewing the information you already learned for just two or three hours three or four times over the course of the whole summer can help make sure that you're ready when the school year starts."

One of the most effective ways to get better scores on tests is to start studying and preparing for the test as early as possible. Definitely don't leave it until the night before. Write down the possible questions that can come on the test and start jotting down key points. Try waking up a little early the morning of the test and skim through notes you made while you were studying. It can really help you grasp last-minute details, by review those notes one last time. The harder the test will be, the earlier you should start studying. Two or three weeks is usually a good starting point."

Everyone likes to feel smart and helpful. Ask questions when you have them and you'll find your teacher liking you more and more.

You don't want to ask a question just so you have a question to ask. Eventually, this will annoy your teacher and they'll think that you're doing it just for the attention. Do not ask personal questions or something that is important only to you. You can ask about homework, pop quiz dates or something that does not bother you alone or if you don't understand. \"What pages do we have to read for tomorrow?\" and \"Ma'am, is there a better method to memorize this?\" will be appropriate. \"Why did I get a D?\" and \" Ma'am, which boy band is the hottest according to you?\" are definite nos. \"Ma'am, do you have a boyfriend?\" type of questions that are related to personal relationships of teachers are not to be asked at any cost.

They'll be proud of you for taking the initiative to get the help you know you need. For example, if there's a math test coming up in a few weeks, and you know that you didn't fully understand how to divide fractions, then ask your teacher if they can go over the instructions with you one more time and do two or three problems with you until you understand it.

Teachers get ticked due to this and can get you suspended. Ask for help. You might think that asking your teacher for help will make them mad because it makes you look stupid. This couldn't be further from the truth. Asking for help actually makes you look smart and it will make your teacher happy. When you ask questions, your teacher knows that you'll work hard and understand what they're teaching much better. They'll be proud of you for taking the initiative to get the help you know you need. For example, if there's a math test coming up in a few weeks, and you know that you didn't fully understand how to divide fractions, then ask your teacher if they can go over the instructions with you one more time and do two or three problems with you until you understand it. Say something like, \"Mr. Green, I'm having a hard time with the homework. For some reason, the genitive case is just really hard for me to get. Can we maybe meet after school or during lunch, so you can try explaining it in a different way?\" Be a helpful student. Be a student that not only keeps out of trouble but also makes the classroom a kinder place. This is about more than just starting fights and arguments (although you shouldn't do those things either). This is also about being a person that helps solves problems when they come up. For instance: \nYou remind others (without being bossy or rude) to keep to classroom rules. If a fight breaks out, you immediately get the nearest teacher, or diffuse the fight, or whatever is appropriate to the situation. You help the teacher with tasks such as handing out papers, materials, making copies, helping a student with a question, or whatever is appropriate. You help classmates who are having problems. If a peer is clearly upset, you try to help him. You open the door for a teacher wheeling the AV cart. You do not pass on ugly rumors, even if it is juicy gossip. Stay on top of your work. Do your homework on time. Get study guides and ask for help at least two weeks before a test, and not two or three days before. Take notes. When your teacher sees you working hard, even if you're not the smartest and even if you don't get the best test scores, they'll still like you best.",
