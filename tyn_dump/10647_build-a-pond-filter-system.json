        "Seal the top of the container with the lid.",
        "The lid will prevent any debris from falling into the filter while also preventing overflow if the filter drains slowly.",
        "Once the lid is on the filter, move it to where you intend to set it up.",
        "Make sure to seal the lid once you put it on.",
        "Installing the Filter Attach a plastic screen to the end of the input hose on the pump.",
        "The water pump you put into your pond has an input hose that draws the water in.",
        "Use the same fish-friendly sealant you used to seal the hoses to the container to glue a metal screen to the end of the input hose to stop it from sucking up large debris.",
        "Wrap the screen around the end of the hose and then use the sealant to glue it in place.",
        "You can use any pliable screen material, including the screening commonly used for windows.",
        "Purchase the screen at your local hardware store.",
        "Connect the pump to the filter inlet.",
        "Attach the hose running from the lid of the filter to the outlet on your water pump.",
        "Place a hose clamp on the hose before you connect it, then use a Phillips head screwdriver to tighten the clamp over the hose and outlet nozzle to ensure it\u2019s secure.",
        "At this stage, the pump is not connected to power, so it won\u2019t function yet.",
        "Place both the pump and the filter at the pond\u2019s edge once they\u2019re connected.",
        "Place the water pump in or near the pond and position the filter next to it.",
        "If the pump is not designed to be submerged, position it in a covered spot near the water\u2019s edge and just submerge the inlet hose.",
        "Place the filter nearby on the water\u2019s edge.",
        "When you turn on the pump, water will flow through it and into the filter.",
        "Submerge the screened end of the inlet hose in the water.",
        "Read the package your pump came in.",
        "It will clearly specify if your pump is meant to be submerged in water.",
        "Run the filter return hose back into the pond.",
        "The lower hose on the filter will allow the filtered water to return back into the pond.",
        "Simply orient the filter so the hole points toward the pond and run the hose from the hole into the water.",
        "This hose returns the clean water to the pond after it's been filtered.",
        "Position this hose as far away from the pump\u2019s inlet hose as you can.",
        "Connect the pump to power and switch it on.",
        "Plug the pump into a power source like an outdoor wall outlet.",
        "With the pump running, water will move into the top of the filter, pass through the filter material and lava rocks, and back out the return hose.",
        "It may take a few minutes for the water to fill the container enough to begin pouring out the return hose.",
        "If water completely fills the container and does not exit from the return hose, the outlet is blocked by the lava rocks.",
        "Disassemble the filter, clear the outlet, and try again.",
        "Clean the filter media every month.",
        "Open the lid of the filter and remove the filter material.",
        "Rinse it thoroughly and then remove the lava rocks.",
        "Use a hose to rinse them off completely and then put both filters back into the container.",
        "If the pond is very dirty, clean the filter every two weeks instead of every month.",
        "Replace the filter material if it becomes too dirty to allow water to pass through."
