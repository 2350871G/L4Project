To avoid damage to your counter/table, you may want to place a piece of cloth between the ball winder and the counter. Find the end of your yarn. This can be tricky. Have patience. Attach the end of your yarn to the notch in your yarn winder. (Refer to your item's directions to see how to do this. Every ball winder is a little bit different!) Slowly begin winding. You will want to do this slowly at first to get used to how the yarn winds. Different fibers react different ways. Continue winding, always in the same direction, slowly. If you go too fast, the yarn may get caught in the gears below (on some models.) After you have wound all the yarn, you should decide if you want a center-pull ball or a outside-pull ball.  If you want a center-pull, hold the end of the yarn coming from the middle with one hand, and gently ease off the ball.  If you want an outer-pull, put your thumb on top of the yarn coming from the center, and gently ease off the ball.  Put your winder away.  If you are winding a skein Undo the skein of yarn.  Put it on your skein winder/the back of a chair/your friends hands.  Follow steps 1-9. ",
