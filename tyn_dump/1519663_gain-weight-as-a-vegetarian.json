A vegetarian diet cuts out all meat products \u2014 beef, poultry, sometimes fish, and so on \u2014 but a vegan diet eliminates all animal and animal-based food products. This means vegans do not eat dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, butter, cheese) and eggs. Vegans therefore base their diets around nutrient-rich plants. The diet of a vegan is more restrictive, and therefore more of a challenge to get complete nutrition (although of course, it is possible), and for underweight individuals, may make it a bit more difficult to gain weight."

                    "description": "A calorie is a unit of energy in food that, when consumed, is either used to fuel the body's activities or is stored as fat. When trying to lose weight, you want a calorie deficit, meaning you burn more calories through activity than you take in through food. To gain weight, you do the opposite: eat more calories than you burn in the course of a day. A vegetarian diet offers many calorie-rich options that will help you increase caloric intake without having to cut down on the exercise or activity that keeps you healthy. One pound of fat is equal to 3,500 calories. For every 3,500 calories you take in without burning them off, you will gain one pound of weight. Your calorie needs will depend on your age, sex, and height. Use an online calorie calculator to find out how many calories you should be consuming on a daily basis. Since you are trying to gain weight, eat slightly more than that amount every day \u2014 but don't go crazy! Eat about 500 extra calories per day to add up to 3,500 calories by the end of the week. At this rate, you will gain one pound per week."

They can also simply consume complete proteins such as garbanzo beans, spirulina, and flax seeds. An example of combined protein would be brown rice and beans. Beans are a go-to meatless protein, and also a great source for calories! Ideally, you should eat at least 3 cups of garbanzo beans every week, though you can eat more than that without fear of health repercussions. Nuts and seeds are protein-rich, but some varieties can add too much cholesterol to your diet. Look for pumpkin seeds, almonds, pistachios, and walnuts, but avoid macadamia nuts and Brazil nuts."
