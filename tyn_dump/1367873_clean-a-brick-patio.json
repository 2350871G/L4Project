Ask a store employee to recommend a model that will work best on your brick patio. If you have the money to invest, consider buying your own pressure washer. Opt for a gasoline-powered pressure washer over an electric model, which will mean dealing with electrical connections that need to be kept dry and out of the way during cleaning."
