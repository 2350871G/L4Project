Knowing the area you need your backsplash to cover will allow you to calculate the cost of materials, which could influence the kind of metal you use. To calculate the dimensions for your backsplash:\nDivide the wall where you plan on installing the backsplash evenly into rectangles to account for cabinets, windows, large appliances and so on. Measure the height and the width of each rectangle. Multiply these numbers together to find the area of each. If you have a diagonal angle to account for, extend the base of the diagonal horizontally until it is even with the top of the diagonal. Connect the horizontal extension and the top of the diagonal to make a right triangle. Calculate the area of triangles by multiplying the base and height of the triangle, then divide that number by 2 (triangle area = (base x height) / 2 ). Add together the area calculations to get the total area in units squared (for example, in\u00b2, ft\u00b2, cm\u00b2, m\u00b2). Multiply this number by 1.1 so you have extra backsplash material to fill in gaps or replace materials damaged during installation."

In many cases, once you choose a backsplash material, you only need to input the total area on the site to determine the cost.
