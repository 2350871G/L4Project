Place the tip of the scissors into the hair where you want to make the cut, then lightly snip the hair in a straight line across the back of the neck. This technique is called point-cutting, and will give the hair a softer look. If you hold the scissors sideways and cut straight across, the hair will look very blunt and it won\u2019t move naturally. To leave as much length as possible, just cut off about \u20442\u2013\u20444 in (1.27\u20130.64 cm) at the end of the hair. This will help remove any split ends. If you are cutting more than that, remember to take into consideration how much the hair will shrink when it dries, since hair stretches when it\u2019s wet and looks longer. Curly hair will be much shorter dry than it is wet, but even straight hair will be somewhat shorter once it dries. It\u2019s best to use a pair of shears intended for cutting hair. You can find these at any beauty supply store, as well as at many drugstores.Styling Tip: Pull the hair straight down and keep your fingers close to the neck so you don\u2019t undercut the hair."

        "This is the guide piece that will help you determine how long to cut the layers.",
        "Point-cut the hair straight up along the section you\u2019re holding.",
        "Once you see the guide piece fall from between your fingers, use the points of your scissors to cut vertically into the section you\u2019re holding.",
        "Cut all the way up the hair, continuing to hold the section straight out away from the head.",
        "This technique creates soft, subtle layers, removing weight from the bottom of the hair.",
        "Repeat with a new section, using a little of the hair you just cut as a guide.",
        "Drop the section you just cut, then pick up a new one right next to it.",
        "The new section should be about as wide as the previous one, no more than \u20442\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm).",
        "As you\u2019re sectioning out the new piece, pick up a little of the hair from the first section.",
        "Use that hair as your guide to help you determine how long to cut the new section.",
        "If you can\u2019t see the shorter hair, you probably picked up too much hair.",
        "Drop the section you\u2019re holding and try again with a little less hair this time.",
        "Continue around the back of the head to just behind each ear.",
        "Cut the hair in sections from the bottom to the top of the head, first around one side, then to the other.",
        "Stop when you get to each ear, though, because you\u2019ll need to use a slightly different technique for the sides and the top of the hair.",
        "Each time you pick up a new section, include a little of the previous section.",
        "This will ensure you create consistent layers all the way around the hair.",
        "When you use the length of the previous section to guide the length of your next cut, this is called a \u201ctraveling guide.\u201d Lift the hair at a 45\u00b0 angle as you cut the top and sides.",
        "When you reach the sides, instead of pulling the sections straight out from the head, lift them up to about a 45\u00b0 angle instead.",
        "Using the same technique as you did for the back, cut all the way up the section with the tips of your scissors.",
        "Holding the hair at an angle will account for the curve of the top of the head, allowing the layers to fall naturally.",
        "These new layers will also blend more subtly into the ones you cut in the back.",
        "Keep using the hair you\u2019ve already cut as a guide as you layer the front and the sides of the hair.",
        "The length of the layers should be consistent all the way from the back to the front.",
        "Check a few sections against each other as you finish layering the hair.",
        "Pull the sections straight up, angled slightly, and out to the side to compare the length to make sure there aren\u2019t any pieces that are longer than the rest.Styling Tip: To create more defined layers, pull the front of the hair straight up, rather than cutting it at a 45\u00b0 angle.",
        "Dry the guy\u2019s hair and check to make sure the cut looks even.",
        "Once the cut is dry, if there are any pieces of hair that look out of place, use your scissors to trim them up.",
        "Remember to use only the points of your scissors; otherwise, you could end up with obvious lines in the hair, and you\u2019ll have to cut the hair much shorter to fix it.",
        "At this point, you should only have to make minor adjustments.",
        "If there are any major sections that look too long or that seem to be very jagged, dampen the hair and start again."
