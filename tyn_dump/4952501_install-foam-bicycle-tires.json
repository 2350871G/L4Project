If you don't have a paddle, you can use another non-metal tool with a slender handle and no sharp edges. Some companies include an installation paddle with the tires, and you may also be able to buy one separately. Work the paddle around the lip, prying it out of the side nearest you. Then remove the tire from the rim. Pry out both the old tire and tube. Your foam tire will replace both of these components. Start seating the foam tire into the rim with your hands. Pick any point along the rim and do your best to squeeze the foam tire into it. It doesn't need to fit perfectly yet, but it should stay seated in the rim without having to hold it down.
