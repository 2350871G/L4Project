Since your new plant is an entirely new variety, it is hard to predict what kind of water, fertilizer, or soil the plant needs to thrive. In general, treat your new hybrid plant the same way you would treat the mother plant in terms of watering, fertilizer, and light. If the plant struggles to thrive, try cultivating it like the father plant. Some combination of the two methods will help you determine what works and what doesn\u2019t. There is always some risk that the hybrid plant will not grow. It\u2019s not always your fault, though. Some combinations will simply not work and it\u2019s impossible to know ahead of time."

Typically, grafting is most efficient in the early spring before either of the plants have had an opportunity to grow. Graft hardwood or asexual plants together in the early spring before the growing season begins. You may be able to graft some flowering plants together, but this process is generally less effective than cross pollination for flowering plants. So long as a plant has a firm stem though, it can be grafted to another plant. Apple, citrus, cherry, beech, and ash trees can all be grafted.

Sterilize your shears or gardening scissors by heating the blades under an open flame or soaking them in a sterilizing solution, like isopropyl alcohol. Use the garden shears or gardening scissors to trim off a 6\u201312 in (15\u201330 cm) length. Make sure that there are buds on the branch that you remove.Variation: Alternatively, you can cut the top half of the plant off from the trunk or main stem by cutting at a 45-degree angle. These larger grafts will be layered against the root plant, which is the half of the plant that is already planted, after making a 45-degree cut. Wrap the 2 cuts together and tie the branches tight. This process is harder to perform, but will generally yield strong results if done correctly. In grafting terms, this portion of the plant is known as the scion. The buds are the knotty, round bumps on the branch. It does not generally matter which plant you remove. If one of the plants grows much more quickly than the other, remove a branch from the plant that grows faster. You can make a scion out of the plant\u2019s skin, wood, or bark. So long as it is the exterior portion of the branch, it does not matter what the origin of the organic matter is."

You want to clip the bud off after new seeds have grown, but before the bud has a chance to develop juvenile traits. Collect the hybrid seeds and store them in the refrigerator. Set your bud down over a piece of paper or petri dish. Use a small utility knife to cut halfway into the bud and gently tear it open. Inside, there are seeds. Locate the seeds in the membrane of the plant and remove them by hand or with tweezers. Store them in an airtight container along with some moist potting soil. Since you\u2019re collecting your seeds after the plant has already started budding, you are unlikely to be successful if you plant the seeds right away. You have to wait for the next growing season to plant your hybrid plant. Plant the new seeds in the spring, a few weeks before the growing season. When you\u2019re ready to plant your seeds, remove them from the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature. Then, dig a 6\u201312 in (15\u201330 cm) hole in a fertile part of your garden, 1\u20134 feet (0.30\u20131.22 m) away from the mother plant. Plant your seeds the same way that you planted the mother plant. Since your new plant is an entirely new variety, it is hard to predict what kind of water, fertilizer, or soil the plant needs to thrive. In general, treat your new hybrid plant the same way you would treat the mother plant in terms of watering, fertilizer, and light. If the plant struggles to thrive, try cultivating it like the father plant. Some combination of the two methods will help you determine what works and what doesn\u2019t. There is always some risk that the hybrid plant will not grow. It\u2019s not always your fault, though. Some combinations will simply not work and it\u2019s impossible to know ahead of time. Grafting Plants Together Select 2 plants with branches or stems of a similar size. Grafting is most effective with asexual, hardwood plants, so you don\u2019t need to worry about finding mother and flower plants. Typically, grafting is most efficient in the early spring before either of the plants have had an opportunity to grow. Graft hardwood or asexual plants together in the early spring before the growing season begins. You may be able to graft some flowering plants together, but this process is generally less effective than cross pollination for flowering plants. So long as a plant has a firm stem though, it can be grafted to another plant. Apple, citrus, cherry, beech, and ash trees can all be grafted. Softer-stemmed plants that can be grafted include roses, tomatoes, eggplants, and boxwoods. Remove a strong, healthy branch from one of the plants to make a scion. First, select a strong, healthy branch to remove from one of the plants. Sterilize your shears or gardening scissors by heating the blades under an open flame or soaking them in a sterilizing solution, like isopropyl alcohol. Use the garden shears or gardening scissors to trim off a 6\u201312 in (15\u201330 cm) length. Make sure that there are buds on the branch that you remove.Variation: Alternatively, you can cut the top half of the plant off from the trunk or main stem by cutting at a 45-degree angle. These larger grafts will be layered against the root plant, which is the half of the plant that is already planted, after making a 45-degree cut. Wrap the 2 cuts together and tie the branches tight. This process is harder to perform, but will generally yield strong results if done correctly. In grafting terms, this portion of the plant is known as the scion. The buds are the knotty, round bumps on the branch. It does not generally matter which plant you remove. If one of the plants grows much more quickly than the other, remove a branch from the plant that grows faster. You can make a scion out of the plant\u2019s skin, wood, or bark. So long as it is the exterior portion of the branch, it does not matter what the origin of the organic matter is. Clean a grafting knife and cut a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) strip out of the scion. Sterilize your grafting knife by holding the blade under an open flame or washing it in a sterilizing agent. Insert the edge of your blade into the skin of the branch or stem where there is at least 1 bud and dig 0.25\u20130.5 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) into the skin. Rotate your blade all the way around the skin. Repeat this process 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) under the first cut and pry the skin off of the plant. Trim portions of the skin off to make a rectangular length of skin. A grafting knife is similar to a pocket knife, but it has a dull edge that makes prying the skin easier. You can do this with a pocket knife or utility knife if you\u2019re careful. You only need a small portion of skin to successfully graft the plant. This will not work if there isn\u2019t a bud on the skin that you remove. Hold the scion up to the target plant and cut around it. Take your scion bark or skin and hold it up against the trunk or stem of the plant, anywhere near the bottom third of the plant. Use a sterilized grafting knife to cut into the target plant by dragging the blade around the scion. Once you\u2019ve cut guidelines into the target plant, set your scion aside. You don\u2019t need to be precise. So long as the scion will fit in the opening that you make on the target plant, this will work. Peel off the skin on the surface of the target plant. Peel away the surface material of the target plant where you made your incisions. Dig the blade into the skin and carefully peel the surface off. Remove enough skin, wood, or bark so that your scion can sit flush against the target plant. Put the scion on the target plant and wrap it with vinyl tape and aluminum foil. Hold the scion over the area that you removed on the target plant. Press it into place and wrap the scion against the stem or trunk using vinyl tape. Pull the tape as tightly as possible to ensure that the scion doesn\u2019t move as it binds to the target plant. Cut the excess tape off and wrap the entire portion in aluminum foil. Add a few more layers of tape to protect the graft. The aluminum foil will prevent moisture from escaping while keeping sunlight out, which can cause the target plant to reject the graft. Remove the wrapping after 3-4 weeks. After 3-4 weeks have passed, the graft will have healed and the target plant will either have accepted or rejected the graft. Remove the aluminum foil. Carefully peel away the vinyl tape. Do this as gently as possible to ensure that you don\u2019t rip the scion off of the plant. If the graft falls off right way or it looks dead, the graft did not take and you will need to try again. Cut the top half of the plant off using shears or pruning saw. The graft will not grow if the leafy, healthy portion of the plant above it is hogging all of the resources. To ensure that the graft receives plenty of nutrients and begins growing, cut the top half of the plant off. Use garden shears for smaller plants and a pruning saw for juvenile trees and stronger plants. Prune any healthy leafy areas near the graft to remove them. Cut a few notches 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) above the graft to wound the plant. The plant will send more resources to this area to help it heal, which will increase the odds that the graft grows. A pruning saw is basically a large knife with a serrated edge. It is designed for pruning tougher vegetation. Wait for the graft to grow and tie it to the target plant. It may take several weeks for the graft to grow. In extreme cases, it may be an entire year before the buds on the graft grow. Care for the plant the same way you would care for the target plant in terms of water, pruning, and fertilizer. Once the graft grows 8\u201316 inches (20\u201341 cm) in length, use twine to tie it to the remaining portion of the trunk or stem. This will ensure that it grows evenly and straight as it develops. This new plant is an entirely new species! Over time, it will overtake the target plant\u2019s stem and completely incorporate the old root system into the new plant.",
