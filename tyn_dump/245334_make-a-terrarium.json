Get a selection of plants that grow in similar conditions in the wild, such as woodland, desert, or tropical plants. For instance, if you choose a woodland theme, you might grow moss, foam flowers, and hepatica. Many of these plants do best in cool, shady conditions. Desert plants, such as cacti and other succulents, do best with brighter light and low humidity levels. Tropical plants, like Tahitian bridal veil and Venus fly traps, like warm and humid conditions."

Instead, stick to small, low-growing plants, or those that can be easily pruned down to a manageable size. For example, starfish plants are ideal for terrariums since they only grow to be about 6 inches (15 cm) tall when they\u2019re fully mature. Some terrarium plants, like club moss, like to spread horizontally. You may need to trim them back to keep them from taking over the entire terrarium.

For example, a fish tank or an old punch bowl could make a great terrarium for some haworthia, hens and chicks, and mini-cacti.

        "This can easily cause your plants to overheat or get singed.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re growing succulents in a shallow dish, put your terrarium in a sunny window so they can get plenty of light throughout the day.",

        "Remove any unhealthy foliage.",
