        "Always use a plastic bottle when you are carbonating your own beverage rather than glass.",
        "This is because there is always the potential for the bottle to shatter if too much pressure is supplied and plastic is a much safer material in this scenario.",
        "Connect the CO2 tank to the CO2 pressure regulator.",
        "Use your hands to screw the CO2 pressure regulator onto the CO2 tank valve.",
        "Once you have tightened it as much as you can, use a wrench to tighten it further.",
        "The pressure regulator controls the pressure of CO2 that is transferred from the tank and into the plastic bottle.",
        "Attach the gas-in ball lock keg coupler to the CO2 pressure regulator.",
        "This is how the CO2 gas will travel at a reduced pressure into the plastic bottle.",
        "Screw the keg coupler onto the CO2 pressure regulator valve, which is found just below the reading meter.",
        "Refer to the instruction manual that came with your CO2 tank and pressure regulator if you have any issues setting up the system.",
        "Open the CO2 tank valve and adjust the pressure to 35-50 psi.",
        "Turn the CO2 tank valve anticlockwise to open it.",
        "Use the dial on the CO2 regulator to change the pressure.",
        "35-50 psi is a good place to start for any carbonated beverage, as it depends on what kind of beverage you are working with and how fizzy you want it to be.",
        "Make sure that the CO2 regulator valve remains closed while you are opening the CO2 tank valve and changing the pressure.",
        "Drinks that are made with mostly fruit are generally carbonated best at around 35 psi.",
        "Mixer drinks such as tonics require higher pressure, so try 40-45 psi for these.",
        "Use 50 psi for wine and cocktails, as alcoholic beverages require higher pressures to be carbonated properly.",
        "Fill up a plastic bottle 3/4 of the way with the cold beverage.",
        "You can carbonate any volume of beverage using a carbonation system.",
        "Make sure that you leave some space at the top of the bottle, as the beverage will expand when you add the CO2.",
        "It\u2019s important that the beverage is cold as CO2 dissolves more easily in cold liquid.",
        "Store the beverage in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours prior to carbonating it.",
        "For example, if you wanted to use a 1 L (34  fl oz) plastic bottle, the maximum volume of the beverage that you carbonate will be 750 ml (25  fl oz).",
        "Squeeze the bottle and insert the carbonation cap.",
        "Gently squeeze the bottle to force the beverage to rise to the very top.",
        "Then screw the carbonation cap onto the opening of the bottle.",
        "The bottle will remain slightly scrunched once you attach the carbonation cap.",
        "Squeezing the bottle removes the excess air, which creates room for the CO2.",
        "When you carbonate the beverage, the bottle will instantly inflate again.",
        "Attach the keg coupler to the carbonation cap.",
        "The gas-in ball lock keg coupler attaches the gas line to the carbonation cap, which means that CO2 will be able to enter the bottle.",
        "Simply push the keg coupler onto the top of the carbonation cap to attach it.",
        "Turn the valve on the CO2 regulator to open it.",
        "Twist the valve anticlockwise to open the gas line between the CO2 tank and the bottle.",
        "The bottle will instantly inflate to its regular size which indicates that the carbonation process is complete.",
        "Shake the bottle for 30 seconds.",
        "Keep the bottle connected to the keg coupler using the carbonation cap.",
        "Vigorously shake the bottle so that the CO2 distributes evenly.",
        "Otherwise, all of the CO2 will remain at the top of the bottle.",
        "Don\u2019t turn the bottle upside down as you are shaking it.",
        "This is because it may cause the liquid to backflow up into the gas line and regulator.",
        "Each time you shake the bottle, you will hear the CO2 regulator release slightly more gas.",
        "This means that you have correctly carbonated the beverage.",
        "Shut the gas valve and remove the carbonation cap.",
        "Turn the gas valve on the CO2 regulator to close the supply of gas.",
        "Pull the keg coupler off the carbonation cap.",
        "Unscrew the carbonation cap from the bottle.",
        "Drink the carbonated beverage or use the carbonation cap to keep it fizzy.",
        "Pour the beverage into glasses to serve it straight away.",
        "If you want to keep it for later, place the carbonation cap back on to keep the CO2 inside the bottle and store the bottle in the refrigerator.",
        "You can carbonate a beverage again that has gone flat using the same process."
