If dirt and debris from other surfaces gets caught in the cloth, it can scratch the computer screen. Vacuum the floor every day, if possible, so dirt and debris is less likely to gather around the computers. Dust all surfaces of the computer. If the fans in the Central Processing Unit (CPU) fill with dust, the computer can overheat. Use a thicker microfiber cloth to pull the dust from the surface. Some types of microfiber cloth have been shown to attract and trap dust. Use compressed air to clean out keyboards. You may also choose to use a disinfectant sprayed on a lint-free cloth on the keyboard and mouses, for sanitary purposes."
