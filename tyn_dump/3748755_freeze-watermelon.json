Split it in half first, then continue cutting it horizontally into slices about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. You can also remove the rind before cutting into the fruit.

It is kind of like an ice cream scoop. You can use it after slicing the whole watermelon in half. Watermelon slices and wedges can be frozen, but they tend to take up a lot of space. They will also lose their texture in the freezer, so they aren\u2019t good when eaten raw. Watermelon juice or puree can also be frozen in a container or as ice cubes.

        "Stir the bowl\u2019s contents together with your hands or a sturdy mixing spoon.",
        "This method works well with watermelon cubes and balls.",
        "The sugar preserves some of the sweetness lost during normal freezing.",
        "Pack the watermelon in freezer-safe containers.",
        "Once the watermelon pieces are well-coated in sugar, move them all into plastic bags or resealable containers.",
        "Leave \u20442 in (1.3 cm) of space at the top of the container so the watermelon has space to expand.",
        "Label containers with the current date before sticking them in the freezer.",
        "You do not need to freeze the watermelon fully before storing it this way.",
        "Freeze the watermelon for up to 12 months.",
        "Store the pieces in a freezer kept at 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) or below.",
        "The watermelon will last indefinitely but lose quality between 10 to 12 months.",
        "Thaw the watermelon pieces in the refrigerator before using them.",
        "Transfer the containers to the refrigerator and wait about 30 minutes for the pieces to soften.",
        "The pieces will be softer than fresh watermelon when they thaw.",
        "You can eat them as is, but they are best used in smoothies and other drinks.",
        "You can store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.",
        "Creating a Syrup Pack Boil sugar and water in a small saucepan.",
        "Combine 4 cups (950 mL) of water with 1 3/4 cups (150 g) of white sugar in a saucepan.",
        "Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat on the stove.",
        "Stir it occasionally until the sugar fully dissolves.",
        "You can also substitute about \u2156 of the sugar with equal parts corn syrup or honey.",
        "Another option is to use fruit juice.",
        "Try replacing the water with pineapple juice, orange juice, or ginger ale.",
        "You can also skip making the syrup and pour the juice directly into a container with the watermelon.",
        "Chill the syrup in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
        "Transfer the syrup to a plastic container you can leave in the refrigerator.",
        "Leave it there until it becomes cool to the touch.",
        "Avoid rushing it.",
        "If the syrup feels hot, let it rest until it cools at least to room temperature.",
        "Hot syrup can cook the fruit, so give it plenty of time to cool.",
        "If it feels warm on your fingers, it is too warm for the watermelon.",
        "Combine the watermelon and syrup gradually in a freezer-safe container.",
        "Choose a quality plastic bag or container you plan on using to keep the watermelon in the freezer.",
        "Pour \u20442 cup (120 mL) of syrup in first, followed by the watermelon.",
        "Then, add the remaining syrup to submerge the watermelon completely.",
        "Make sure you leave at least \u20442 in (1.3 cm) of empty space at the top of the container.",
        "This gives the container\u2019s contents room to expand as they freeze, preventing the container from popping open.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to make syrup, you can submerge the watermelon in fruit juice to create a juice pack.",
        "It will maintain the watermelon at a similar quality to a syrup pack.",
        "Cover the watermelon with a piece of wax paper.",
        "Keep the watermelon submerged in the syrup!",
        "To store it properly, use only water-resistant paper.",
        "Wrap the paper tightly over the top of the container before sealing it with a lid.",
        "It will hold the watermelon down in the syrup so it doesn\u2019t dry out.",
        "Label the container with the current date so you always know when you packed it.",
        "Freeze the fruit for up to 12 months.",
        "Keep the watermelon stored at or below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C).",
        "When you\u2019re ready to use it, you can let it thaw in the refrigerator or add it almost immediately to your dish.",
        "You can leave it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days before it spoils.",
        "Fruit packed this way is best for desserts and fruit cocktails.",
