        "Use tile nippers for small tiles.",
        "Tiles that are smaller than 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) may be difficult to cut on a score-and-snap tile cutter.",
        "Not only could you hurt yourself, but you could break the tile.",

        "A pair of safety goggles is highly recommended because it will protect your eyes against flying pieces of tile.",
        "A good respiratory mask is only needed if you will be cutting the tiles with a wet saw or grinder.",
        "If you will be using tile nippers, you won't need a mask.",

        "Install the tile sheet using your preferred tile cement.",
        "Spread the tile cement across the backsplash area, then press the tile sheet into place.",
        "If you cut your tile sheet smaller, arrange it so that the gaps caused by the size difference are along the top edge, where the cabinets are.",
        "If there is a gap along 1 of the side edges, position the sheet so that the gap is in a corner.",
        "Measure the excess tiles against the gaps.",
        "You should still have some tile sheeting left over from when you cut the tile sheet down.",
        "Take these excess tiles, and measure them against the gaps.",
        "If you need to, mark the back of each time with a pencil or marker to figure out how much you need to trim.",
        "If your tiles are staggered like bricks, the gaps won't be consistent.",

        "A wet saw should do the trick for most tiles.",
        "If the tiles are smaller than 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm), a pair of tile nippers may work better.",
        "The tiles should fall away from their mesh backing as you cut them.",
        "If they don't.",
        "cut them away with your box cutter.",
        "If the tiles are more than 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) across, you may be able to cut them with a score-and-snap tile cutter.",
        "Press the cut tiles into place.",
        "Make sure that you keep the grouting gaps between the tiles consistent so that they match up with the grouting gaps on the tiles that are already on the wall.",
        "Cutting Installed Tiles Cover your counter and put on a mask and safety goggles.",
        "Cover your counter with plastic sheeting to protect it and make cleaning up easier.",
        "Put on a pair of safety goggles to protect your eyes against dust.",
        "Finally, put on a mask suitable for working with fine particles.",
        "Most dust masks and respirator masks come with a description of what they are used for, such as sanding dust, aerosol, etc.",
        "Choose the one for dust.",
        "Make the tile where you wish to cut it.",
        "A pencil may work just fine on a slate or ceramic tile, but if the tile is glazed, you should switch to a marker.",
        "Try to be as precise as possible for this step.",

        "If you need to get inside the wall, then you should cut through the dry wall as well.",

        "Mounting a towel rack does not.",
        "Use an oscillating cutter to cut through tight corners.",
        "While a dremel rotary tool will work for most lines, it won't work on tight corners.",

        "You may have to experiment before you find the right one for your type of tile.",
        "A multi-surface blade seems to work better than a tile blade, however.",
        "Pull the tile away.",
        "Wedge a thin knife or spatula behind the tile and pop it out.",
