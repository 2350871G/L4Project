                    "description": "This is an easy way to stay warmer without having to do much. An under-layer is a layer of clothing which goes under your normal clothing. A common form of underwear are thermals. This under-layer can take many forms, but each can help you stay warm without adding a lot of bulk or extra steps. Common under-layer items include stockings, leggings, thermal shirts, and long underwear. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that having this under-layer can become uncomfortable if you are in a warm room. For example, if you bundle up to drive to work in a warm office, you may find the additional base layer too much. After skiing, you may have to strip down to your thermals when sitting in front of the fireplace in your alpine cabin. If opaque, this is generally considered appropriate apres-ski wear."

If the water penetrates through your clothing, your clothing will only make you colder. Examples of watery conditions you might encounter include rain, snow, and spray (such as if you will be out on a boat or if there are lots of puddles on the ground). You can throw a rain jacket on under a warm but less waterproof coat, for example. When you buy coats, look for materials that are very waterproof and warm, such as neoprene."

You\u2019ve probably heard about fleece but this fabric is not for everyone. Find out what other options are available to you and then go on a shopping trip. Wear wool, if you can. This is one of the best insulating materials, even though it can be expensive. You can also use wool clothes, instead of just wool coats, to cut down on how much you need to wear total. Many inexpensive wool items can be found at vintage stores. Other warm materials include down, lined leather, fur, and neoprene. Wool will continue to keep you warm, even if wet.

        "The most basic thing you can do to stay warm both inside and outside is to layer your clothing.",
        "Ask anyone who has lived in some of the colder parts of the world, like Alaska and Norway, and they\u2019ll all tell you: wear layers.",
        "This lets you have one outfit for the day that adjusts easily for snowy weather outside, as well as switching over naturally to your toasty warm office.",
        "An example of an outfit would include stockings, jeans, a long sleeve shirt, a button-up shirt, a sweater and a coat.",
        "With all or a combination of these things on, you can easily adjust to a roaring hot classroom, an icy office, a neutral grocery store, and the freezing temperatures outside without any problem.",
        "Insulate your home.",
        "Make sure your home is as insulated as it can be.",
        "You might want to switch out the insulation in your walls or ceiling.",
        "You can also do more basic things, like putting up thick curtains and blankets over windows.",
        "Cellular shades are actually pretty effective at keeping cold air from escaping from a window and they're often cheaper than other curtain options.",
        "You can also further insulate windows and any glass doors with an insulating film, a plastic material that is clear and adheres to all kinds of glass.",
        "Close off unused rooms and focus on heating a central room.",
        "It is often easier and cheaper to focus on keeping one room warm than on keeping an entire apartment or house warm.",
        "Figure out a single room that your family can stick to during waking hours and seal it off from the rest of the house.",
        "Close the doors and keep them covered in blankets.",
        "Centralize your heaters and other applications to warm the room.",
        "This saves you from having to put a lot of effort in keeping rooms warm that you won't use very often.",
        "Seal gaps that let in cold air.",
        "You'll want to keep an eye out for holes and gaps that will let cold air into your home or between rooms that have different levels of insulation.",
        "The most common example is the gap under doors, but you may also find that some windows let in a draft or that rooms above a basement have cold air coming up through the floor.",
        "Rolled up blankets and carpets can easily be used to plug these gaps.",
        "Prepare your bed.",
        "You'll probably want your bed to be warm before you crawl in to sleep.",
        "Those icy sheets are no one's friend.",
        "There are lots of ways that you can get your bed ready before it's time to sleep.",
        "Try:\nA hot water bottle, placed under the blanket at the lower center of the bed, or run your blanket through the dryer for 10-20 minutes on medium or high heat.",
        "Bake cookies.",
        "Or anything, really.",
        "Your oven, when it's turned on and heated up to the usual baking temperature of around 365 degrees, can work really well to make the room that it's in nice and warm.",
        "Make the kitchen your weekend base of operations and hang out while cookies or a dinner roast is prepared.",
        "Doing your laundry can similarly heat up nearby rooms.",
        "Make your chores count and be quick to do your laundry on really cold days.",
        "You can wear items fresh out of the dryer to get even warmer.",
        "Drink something hot.",
        "Whether it's a hot cup of lemon tea or a Mexican coffee, drinking a hot liquid can boost how warm you feel from the inside out.",
        "Turn the kettle on and break out the mugs because you're about to get nice and warm.",
        "You might think or have been told that adding alcohol to a hot drink will make you feel warmer, but that's not really the best advice.",
        "Alcohol actually lowers your body temperature, even though it gives you that \"burning\" feeling.",
        "If it's dangerously cold in your home, you should avoid alcohol.",
        "Take a hot shower or bath.",
        "A hot shower or bath can just be enough to get your body back to a reasonable level of warmth.",
        "Find yourself just getting cold again after five minutes?",
        "Make sure you're bundled up as soon as you get out, with warm clothes, a robe, and house shoes.",
        "This will help your body retain the heat of the bath."
