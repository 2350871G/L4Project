Stir in 2 cups (470 ml) of water, \u00bc cup (68 g) of salt, \u00bc cup (170 g) of packed ground sugar, and 1 tablespoon (7 g) of black pepper with a whisk. Continue mixing the beer brine until most of the salt and sugar dissolves. Add 2 sprigs of garlic and 3 cloves of garlic if you want to put additional herbs in your brine. Experiment with different spices to find new flavor combinations. It\u2019s okay is some of the salt and sugar doesn\u2019t dissolve yet. Beers to Try\nUse a lager if you want a light, caramelized flavor for white meats, such as chicken or turkey. Try a pale ale for hints of malt and hops when you make meats like pork or steak. Use a brown ale or stout if you want a rich, nutty taste for beef and whole turkey."
