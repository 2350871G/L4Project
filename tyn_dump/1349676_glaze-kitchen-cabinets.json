Apply the paint color of your choice and allow it to dry thoroughly. Oil-based paints work better for kitchen cabinets because it dries to a harder finish than water-based paint, making it more durable and easier to clean. If you want your cabinets to be a cream color, then choose a shade that has more of a white tint than a yellow. This will provide a nicer, cleaner look once the glaze is applied. If you are repainting make sure you cover all surfaces including the edges of the cabinets and the inside of the doors to provide a more polished look. Allow the doors to dry for 24 hours before applying paint to the other side. Make sure you cover all surfaces including the edges and crevices. You can use a small paintbrush to do these small areas."
