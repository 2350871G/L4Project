If you notice any residue from the cleaning solution once the rug is dry, use a clean, dry brush to brush it away. If you leave the rug outside, set it on grass or gravel so it can drain properly. Vacuuming Kilim Rugs Vacuum the rug weekly. You won't have to scrub your kilim rug too often if you keep it free of dirt and dust. Running a vacuum over it once a week is usually sufficient, though you may want to vacuum more if the rug is in a heavily trafficked area. Use low suction. You can use a vacuum cleaner to keep your kilim rug clean, but you shouldn\u2019t use a high suction setting or the revolving brush on your vacuum. Both can snag the fibers and cause damage. If your vacuum doesn't have a low suction setting, use the extension hose or crevice tool attachment to go over the fringe. Use a small handheld vacuum if you have one. They are not powerful enough to damage the fibers. Vacuum both sides of the rug. Because a kilim rug is hand-knotted, it doesn\u2019t have the backing that other rugs often have. To keep it clean, make sure to run the vacuum over both sides to remove all of the dirt and debris. Avoid vacuuming the fringe. The fringe definitely adds to a kilim rug\u2019s charm, so you want to keep it intact. Don\u2019t run your vacuum over the fringe because it may snag the fibers and unravel or tear them off. Treating Spills Remove any solids in the spill. If the food or another item that you\u2019ve spilled contains any solid pieces, use a spoon to carefully scoop them up. Avoid using too much pressure to remove them or you may wind up pressing the items into the fibers and making the stain worse. Blot away as much of the liquid as possible. Use a clean sponge or piece of paper towel to carefully press against the stain and remove the excess moisture. Start blotting at the outer edge of the spill and work in toward the center so you don\u2019t spread the stain. Be sure to lift the rug and blot the floor underneath the spill as well. Lift the rug and place a shallow container under the stain. Because you\u2019ll be rinsing the rug, you need a container to catch the water. A baking sheet or shallow Tupperware container works well.

If there is a stain left behind even after you rinse and blot the stain, you should consult a professional rug cleaner to handle the job. Trying to remove it yourself may damage the rug. Handling Pet Stains Cover the urine-stained area with baking soda. Pet urine can be difficult to remove if it has already dried. However, if the rug is still damp, sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda over the affected area. For dried pet stains, consult a professional rug cleaner. Set a clean cloth over the stain and press down. Choose a white towel or rag to avoid discoloring the rug. Once the cloth is in place, apply heavy pressure to the area for 2 to 3 minutes to drive the urine into the baking soda. Stepping on the cloth is usually the best way to press on it. Remove the baking soda and repeat the process as necessary. Use a spatula to carefully lift the baking soda off the rug, and discard it. If the rug is still damp, repeat the process. Place a container beneath the stained area. Lift the rug up and set a shallow container, such as baking pan or Tupperware container, beneath the affected spot.
