        "Most paper airplane folding instructions are given with 8.5\u201dx11\u201d (A4) paper in mind.",
        "Altering the height or width of the paper can drastically change how the airplane turns out, and if it\u2019s too wide or too narrow, it may not fly at all.",
        "If you\u2019re working with scrap paper, cut or tear it until it\u2019s roughly the proportions of letter paper, then reproduce the folds on a slightly larger or smaller scale.",
        "Use paper that accepts a fold.",
        "Another advantage of medium weight papers like letter paper and stationery is that any creases you make will stay secure.",
        "This is especially important if you want your airplane to fly far and fast, as sloppy, loose folds make the plane less aerodynamic.",
        "As a rule, the smoother the paper, the better it will take a fold.",
        "Avoid pulpy papers and those with large grains that get mushy when creased.",
        "Raw, foil, laminate and glossy papers do not take a fold well.",
        "Apply pressure to each crease you make and go over it a couple of times.",
        "The neater the fold, the better it will maintain its shape."
