Screw the lens into place on the front of your camera until it's secure. Most stock lenses that come with your camera are 16-24mm, so you don't need to buy any additional supplies."

Once the camera is secure, put the slide back onto your tripod until it clicks in place. Make sure your tripod legs are on level ground so your camera isn't tilted when you're taking photos."

Take a couple practice photos, and zoom into them on your camera's live-view to see how they look. If your pictures are blurry, adjust the focus until they appear clear. If you can zoom in on your camera's live-view, zoom in on one of the stars or the moon in frame and watch the screen while you adjust the focus ring. That way you don't have to take additional pictures to find your focus."

Turn up the exposure time on your camera to 20-30 seconds so you're more likely to catch a meteor in frame. If your exposure time runs too long, it will catch star movement as the Earth rotates. Never exceed more than 30 seconds of exposure time or else you may confuse star movement for meteors in your photo."

Hold the cable in your hand and press the button to take a picture. Shutter release cables can be purchased online or from specialty camera stores.

As you take your photos, watch the sky instead of your camera so you can see the meteors in person. For example, if your exposure time is 30 seconds, then try to take 2 pictures every minute. Make sure you have enough space on your memory card for your photos. Usually, a 64 GB memory card will work. Look up the peak times for the meteor shower so you know the best times to shoot."
