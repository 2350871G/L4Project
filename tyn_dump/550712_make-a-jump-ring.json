If you are using a wooden dowel, you can also use a jewelers saw with a 2/0 blade: move the wire up the dowel to the end, hold the dowel steady and saw a straight line through it. It is also handy to wrap a single layer of masking tape around the wire so that the rings don't fall everywhere. Slowly move the wrapped wire up the rod until you are done."
