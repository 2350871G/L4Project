Folding and Inserting the Tissues Open the side of a box of tissues with the top of the box facing upwards. Purchase a rectangle box of tissues from a local big box or grocery store. Position the box like you would if you were going to open the top to take out tissues, and instead open the side of the box so you can easily remove the tissues without having to fold or bend them. A brand name box of tissues is better because they tend to be higher quality, meaning they won\u2019t rip as easily when you take them out of the mason jar.

This will get rid of any lingering dust or dirt. Wipe down the inside of the jar first and then the outside so your tissues will be sitting in a clean container. Decorate the jar before you put the tissues in it. Paint the empty jar with acrylic paint to update the color, if desired.
