                    "description": "Bamboo needs a soil with light to moderate density: fast-draining, but able to hold moisture. You can use a standard potting mix, or make your own from \u2153 loam, \u2153 perlite (or washed sand), and \u2153 peat moss (or well-rotted compost). Most bamboo can tolerate a wide range of well-draining soils, so the exact composition won't make or break your plants. You can use decent quality soil from your garden instead of potting soil. Avoid heavy clay soil, which drains poorly and is difficult to improve. Bamboo tends to do best in slightly acidic soil, with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5, but most species tolerate a pH up to 7.5. Most soil falls into this range."

If your plant has been in the same place for a while, look into other possible causes:\nTemperate species often drop leaves during low-light conditions. A cool, low-light dormant period in winter is good for these plants, and reduces leaf drop. The fewer green leaves there are, the less water the plant needs. Many species drop leaves in spring (or less commonly, fall), gradually replacing them with new ones.
