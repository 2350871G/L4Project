Repeat this step with the other can. The smoother and rounder the baffles are, the further the ball will fly! Stack all 3 cans on top of each other, then duct tape them together. Place the can with the firing hole on it at the bottom on a table right-side-up. Then place 1 of the other 2 cans on the top of this can right side up. Position the baffle of the second can so it's over the top of the first can. Peel a piece of duct tape, approximately 3.5 in (8.9 cm) long, off a roll and wrap it around the top rim of the bottom can and the bottom rim of the top can to secure them together.

Cover the bottom of the mortar with 3 layers of duct tape as well, not just the sides. The more secure the cans are, the more reuse you'll get out of your mortar. Encase the cans in 3 in (7.6 cm) PVC tubing.
