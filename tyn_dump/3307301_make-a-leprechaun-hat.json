If you want a taller hat, you can skip this step and use the entire sheet of construction paper for the body of the hat. You can recycle the other half of the sheet--you won\u2019t need it anymore! Draw a belt onto the bottom of one construction paper half. Carefully draw a straight line along the bottom of one of the green halves, about 2 inches (51 mm) from the bottom.

Form a cylinder from the body rectangle. Fold the rectangular piece of fabric in half widthwise, with the wrong side facing out, and pin in place. Stitch a straight stitch along the open end of the fabric, roughly \u20442 inch (13 mm) in from the edge. You can also use fabric glue or iron-on seams for the hat!

Pin the inside of the ring to the remaining open edge of the hat and stitch in place. Cut out a yellow rectangle for a buckle. Use sturdy, ravel-resistant fabric like felt and cut out a rectangle that is 4 inches (100 mm) by 5.5 inches (140 mm). Cut out a second rectangle from the center of this rectangle, making an outline that is roughly 1 inch (25 mm) thick. Cut out a black rectangle for a band. The strip of black fabric should be about 3 inches (76 mm) wide and the same length as your original body rectangle. Felt is the best choice, but you can use any sturdy, ravel-resistant black fabric. Attach the buckle to the band. Sew or glue the yellow buckle piece onto the center of the black band. Fabric glue is best, but you can use school glue for felt and most other fabrics.

        "Fabric Leprechaun Hat Use iron-on interfacing to add stability to the hat (optional).",
        "If you are using a fabric that is somewhat flimsy, place iron-on interfacing on the back side of the fabric and iron in place until bonded.",
        "This will help your hat hold its shape, but it\u2019s not required.",
        "Cut out a large circle from sturdy green fabric.",
        "Craft felt is a good choice for this project--it\u2019s strong, comes in multiple colors, and is inexpensive.",
        "The circle should have a diameter of about 12 inches (300 mm).",
        "Avoid using soft, foldable fabric like jersey for this project.",
        "This hat is designed for children.",
        "For an adult-sized hat, you may need an initial circle that is roughly 18 inches (460 mm) in diameter.",
        "Divide the circle into a ring and a center circle.",
        "Cut a small circle out of your original circle.",
        "The diameter of this circle should roughly match to diameter of the wearer's head.",
        "Be sure to cut out the center of the circle instead of cutting through the outer ring!",
        "To find the correct head size, drape the fabric over the wearer\u2019s head and mark it with a pencil.",
        "Cut out a rectangle for the body of the hat.",
        "Use the same green fabric used for the circles.",
        "The length of the rectangle should roughly match the circumference of the smaller circle with 1 inch (25 mm) of extra material for a seam allowance.",

        "Form a cylinder from the body rectangle.",

        "Cut out a second rectangle from the center of this rectangle, making an outline that is roughly 1 inch (25 mm) thick.",
        "Cut out a black rectangle for a band.",
        "The strip of black fabric should be about 3 inches (76 mm) wide and the same length as your original body rectangle.",
        "Felt is the best choice, but you can use any sturdy, ravel-resistant black fabric.",
        "Attach the buckle to the band.",
        "Sew or glue the yellow buckle piece onto the center of the black band.",
        "Fabric glue is best, but you can use school glue for felt and most other fabrics.",
        "Glue or stitch the band to the hat.",
        "Sew or glue the black band around the bottom of the hat, just above the brim.",
        "The band should almost lie flush against the rim of the hat.",
        "Bring the back edges together at the back edge of the hat, allowing them to overlap.",
        "Using a Pre-Made Hat Buy a ready-made craft hat.",
        "Craft stores sell plastic or felt hats that are ready for crafting.",
        "Buy one in green if possible, but if you can only get them in white, try spray-painting the hat green before starting.",
        "Top hats or derby hats are great for this!",
        "You can also use a real hat for this method.",
        "Cut out a rectangle window out of yellow paper or fabric.",
        "Cut a 3 inches (76 mm) by 2 inches (51 mm) rectangle out of yellow construction paper or fabric.",
        "You should have a rectangular shape that looks like a window--a border with an empty space in the middle.",

        "Add glitter to the rectangle.",
        "Spread a layer of school glue or glue stick to the buckle.",

        "Cut a 2 inches (51 mm) black band.",
        "Use the same kind of material you did for the buckle.",
        "The band should be about 2 inches (51 mm) wide, and it should be long enough to wrap completely around the base of the hat\u2019s brim.",
        "Glue the buckle to the band.",
        "Glue the buckle to the center of the band.",
        "It should look like the buckle is holding the band in place, just like a real buckle.",
        "If you are using fabric, you can sew them together instead.",
        "Glue the band to the hat.",
        "Use craft glue to attach the band to the base of the hat\u2019s brim.",
