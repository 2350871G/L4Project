They pull hot air directly from within the engine compartment into the engine. Cold air intakes pull cool air from places outside the engine compartment such as around the wheel well or bumper. These are a bit more complicated to install since you may have to install part of the intake from underneath the car. The cooler air is denser than the air inside the engine compartment so it gives a better boost to performance and gas mileage than short-pipe designs. Ram-air intakes usually pull cool air from the bumper area. Because they are designed to be at the front of the car, they actually pressurize the cool air coming into the engine as the car moves faster. This provides maximum airflow and maximum benefits. It is also the most complicated to install since you will likely have to install part of the system from underneath the car. You may even have to remove your bumper."
