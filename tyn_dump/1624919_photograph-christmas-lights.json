Try to get to the location early, roughly 15-20 minutes before dusk, so you\u2019re sure not to miss the ideal photographing time. Check to see when the sun is going to set so you can make a plan to arrive before dusk. If you take the pictures earlier, the lights won\u2019t look lit in the photos, and if you take the pictures after the sun has set, then you won\u2019t be able to see the background. When the Christmas lights look like they\u2019re shining brighter against the darkening sky, it\u2019s time to start taking pictures. Continue taking pictures of the lights until you\u2019re satisfied with your collection or the sun completely sets."

A tripod is necessary to keep your photographs stable and not blurry. Set the tripod up on stable ground before dusk so that you have time to make any adjustments. If you don\u2019t have a tripod, try balancing your camera on the hood of a car or another stable surface. If you're using your phone, consider investing in a portable tripod made for your specific type of cellphone."

Decide exactly what you want to capture in your photo, such as the details of the ornaments on the tree, or a decorated house with lots and lots of lights that is best seen from far away. For example, a picture of a close-up of a Christmas tree will likely require less lighting than a picture of a house lit up when the sun has set."

Avoid backlighting to ensure your picture doesn't come out super dark and be aware of how the windows will impact the lighting. If you're taking the picture indoors at night, try to dim the lights in your house so that the Christmas tree stands out but can still be seen. Take pictures from several different angles with different levels of lighting to see which one looks best."
