    "text": " Preparing the Peaches for Canning Select your peaches. Freestone peaches are peaches where the flesh removes easily from the pit. These are the easiest peaches to can. Freestone peaches are the peaches most commonly found in grocery stores and markets. Keep in mind that it takes about 5 large peaches to fill 1 quart jar. Place the peaches in a bowl. Run the peaches and bowl under cold water. Blanch peaches in boiling hot water. Blanching peaches makes it easier to peel the peaches and stops the enzymes from degrading the flavor during storage. To do this, fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. Put the peaches in the boiling water and make sure that they are submerged. Leave the peaches in the water for 40 seconds.

Keep the syrup mixture hot after the sugar has dissolved. Do not keep boiling it. If you continue to boil it, the syrup may burn and they you will have to start all over. Sterilizing the Jars Place the jars in the dishwasher. Run the dishwasher for a full cycle. Sterilizing the jars ensures that no bacteria will grow in your canned peaches. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place the jar lids in the boiling water. Keep the lids in the boiling water until the jars are filled. Use a magnetic lid lifter to retrieve the lids when you are ready for them. Wear gloves to avoid any burns.Magnetic lid lifters can be bought on Amazon or at Target and some grocery stores. To make your own jar grabber, simply place rubbed bands at the end of a pair of tongs. Canning the Peaches Place the cut peaches into the simmering syrup mixture. Stir the pot for 5 minutes.Ladle the peaches into the jars directly from the mixture. Leave \u00bd to 1 full inch of space at the top of the jar. Pack the peaches tightly into the jar. Run a rubber spatula between the packed peaches and the jar. Doing this will remove any air bubbles trapped in the jar. Air bubbles could cause mold to grow inside the jar after it has been sealed. Tilt the jar slightly while running the spatula between the fruit and jar. Pour the syrup mixture into the jar. Leave \u00bd an inch of space from the top. The peaches should be entirely covered. Wipe off all spills and sugar from jar, especially the lid area. Place lids on jar and secure tightly. Using the Canner Place jars in a canner, leaving 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of water above the jars. If you do not have a canner, you can make your own. Find a pot or saucepan that is large enough to hold the jars. There should also be room for an inch of water above the jars.
