You can also add shredded paper towels to the bottom of the cage, as the guinea pig may use them to create a safe place to hide.

Corner it in its cage and get ahold of it as you would with a more docile guinea pig, but hold on a little tighter. Make sure the carrier is very close by, so you can quickly move the guinea pig straight into the carrier. Once the guinea pig is inside of the carrier, close it properly. Make sure the carrier is secure and your guinea pig is as comfortable as possible. You can put two guinea pigs in the same carrier. If you are traveling with more than one guinea pig, it is perfectly fine to put them both together in one carrier. However, you must keep checking on them both to see if they are getting along."

Also make sure that your guinea pig's cage will not be in the sun while you drive. This can quickly lead to the guinea pig getting overheated. You should also avoid putting your guinea pig's cage next to your stereo speakers if you are planning on playing your stereo.
