Hold a piece of solder to the tip of the wire, then touch the tip of a hot soldering iron so it touches the solder and the copper at the same time. Take the soldering iron away after 1-2 seconds, and repeat if needed. Continue until you have soldered each of the 4 ends of the speaker wire. Keep the soldering iron away from anything flammable, and do not touch it to your skin or any other part of your body. Only apply a small amount of solder on the very end of the wire. Don't cover up too much of the copper, since it's a better conductor than the solder. If you don't want to solder the wire, twisting it is fine. However, if you move your speaker components around a lot, the wire could start to unravel eventually."
