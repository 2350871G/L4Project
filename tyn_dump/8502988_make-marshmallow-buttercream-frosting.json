Warm the mixture over medium-high heat until a candy thermometer reads 240 degrees Fahrenheit (116 degrees Celsius), which should take 10 to 15 minutes. If you don\u2019t have a candy thermometer, fill a bowl with ice cold water. Drop some of the corn syrup mixture into the water. The mixture should easily form a soft, flexible ball in the water when it reaches the right temperature. If it forms thin threads instead, it isn\u2019t hot enough yet. If it forms a hard ball, you\u2019ve cooked it too long."
