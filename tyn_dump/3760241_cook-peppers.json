        "Generally, hot peppers are cut into rings, while sweet bell peppers are cut into strips or bite-sized pieces.",
        "Keep in mind that the size will determine how long the pieces will need to cook for.",
        "Strips, large bell pepper rings, and pieces that are over 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size may need a minute or two more than small pepper rings and small chunks under 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "Cook the peppers in the hot oil.",
        "Add the peppers to the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for about 4 to 7 minutes, or until the peppers are crisp-tender.",
        "Frequent stirring is very important in this method.",
        "You do not want to burn the pepper skins or the pepper flesh, but if you let the pieces stay still for too long, the sections touching the pan are more likely to become charred.",
        "Use as desired.",
        "Stir-fried peppers are usually prepared with other ingredients, but you can enjoy them on their own or use them in any recipe calling for some variety of cooked pepper.",
        "For a quick side dish or a light lunch, you could toss the peppers with cooked rice and a drizzle of your favorite dressing\u2014soy sauce, Italian dressing, and so on.",
        "Boiling Boil a small amount of water.",
        "Pour 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water into a large skillet with high sides.",
        "Heat this over medium-high on the stove.",
        "After the water begins to boil, add about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt.",
        "The salt helps to draw out the flavor of the pepper, but adding the salt before the water boils will increase the amount of time you have to wait before the water reaches a steady boil.",
        "Cut the peppers into rings or strips.",
        "If working with small hot peppers, cut them into rings.",
        "For larger bell peppers, cut them into rings or strips.",
        "Keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to cook than smaller pieces.",
        "No matter what size you use, you should at least try to keep the pieces consistent in size.",
        "Cook the peppers in the boiling water.",
        "Place the peppers in the boiling water and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they feel crisp-tender.",
        "The peppers will ideally still have a little \u201ccrunch\u201d to them, but the flesh should be notably softer than when the peppers were raw.",
        "Serve while warm.",
        "You can enjoy the peppers on their own or you could add them to any recipe calling for pre-cooked peppers.",
        "Steaming Boil water in a steamer.",
        "Fill the bottom of a steamer with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water.",
        "Sit the steaming basket on top, making sure that the bottom does not come into contact with the water, and boil the water over high heat.",
        "If you do not have a steamer, you could use a large stockpot and a metal/wire mesh colander.",
        "Just make sure that the colander fits onto the rim of the pot but that the bottom of the colander does not touch the bottom of the pot.",
        "Also make sure that the lid of the stockpot will still fit on the stockpot with the colander inside.",
        "Cut the peppers into smaller pieces.",
        "Cut small peppers into rings and large peppers into rings or strips.",
        "Keep the pieces consistent in size and shape to ensure even cooking.",
        "Steam the peppers until crisp-tender.",
        "Add the peppers to the steamer basket.",
        "Cover and cook for 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "The cover must stay on the pot during the cooking process so that the steam will remain trapped inside.",
        "If you lift the lid off too often, you will release too much steam, thereby increasing the amount of time the peppers will need to cook for.",
        "Serve warm.",
        "Remove the peppers from the steamer and enjoy them on their own or in any recipe calling for pre-cooked peppers.",
        "Microwaving Cut the peppers into smaller pieces.",
        "Cut the peppers into rings, slices, or bite-sized pieces.",
        "Small hot peppers are usually cut into rings, but larger sweet peppers can be cut into any of those three forms.",
        "Make sure that the pieces are even in size.",
        "Otherwise, if some pieces are larger than others, they may take longer to cook while other pieces will already be done or overcooked.",
        "Place the pieces in a microwave-safe dish with a little water.",
        "Transfer the pieces into a microwave-safe casserole dish and add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of water, just enough to cover the bottom without completely covering the peppers.",
        "Microwave until crisp-tender.",
        "Cover the dish and microwave on high power for 90 seconds to 2 minutes per 1 cup (250 ml) of peppers.",
        "Stir once in the middle of the process.",
        "Most of the cooking action taking place results from the steam building up inside of the dish, so keeping the lid on is important in order to keep that steam trapped.",
        "Serve warm.",
        "Drain out any remaining water and enjoy the peppers alone or serve them with another dish."
