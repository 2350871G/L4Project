Grilling Dry-Rubbed Country Style Ribs Combine the dry rub. Get out a small bowl and measure all of the dry rub ingredients into it. Stir the mixture until the spices are well mixed. You'll need:\n2 tablespoons (25 g) packed light brown sugar\n2 tablespoons (36 g) kosher salt\n2 teaspoons (4 g) ground ancho chile\n2 teaspoons (4 g) ground chipotle chile\n1/2 teaspoon (1 g) ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon (1 g) garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon (1 g) onion powder Coat the ribs with the dry rub.

Pour the hot, ashy briquettes directly in the center of the grill grate. The temperature of the grill should be between 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C).
