Use a shovel to dig your hole, being careful not to hit or damage the leach pipe with the blade. Expose the entire diameter of the pipe so you can easily feed a sewer jetter hose into it later on. Continue digging up the remaining pipes so you\u2019re able to clean them all out. If you aren\u2019t sure where the ends of the pipes are in your yard, contact a septic specialist to locate the system for you. You won\u2019t know exactly which leach field pipe has a clog unless you hire a septic specialist to check them with a camera. Otherwise, you need to expose the ends of all the leach field pipes.Tip: Hire specialists to drain your yard if the septic system backed up and leaked into the topsoil. Don\u2019t try to pump the wastewater yourself since it contains harmful bacteria and contaminants."

        "Otherwise, you need to expose the ends of all the leach field pipes.Tip: Hire specialists to drain your yard if the septic system backed up and leaked into the topsoil.",
        "Don\u2019t try to pump the wastewater yourself since it contains harmful bacteria and contaminants.",
        "Feed the end of a sewer jetter into the end of a leach pipe.",
        "A sewer jetter is a long, thin hose that shoots streams of pressurized water forward and backward through the pipe.",
        "Locate the end of the sewer jetter hose that has the nozzle attached to it and slide it into one of the leach field pipes.",
        "Push the sewer jetter about 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) into the pipe before stopping.",
        "You can buy sewer jetter hoses from your local hardware or yard care store.",
        "You will need to clean each leach field pipe with the sewer jetter in order for the system to work correctly again.",
        "It may be difficult to feed the sewer jetter into the pipe, but it will be easier once water flows through it when you start cleaning.",
        "Connect the other end of the sewer jetter hose to a pressure washer.",
        "Use a gas-powered pressure washer that has a flow of 2\u20134 gallons (7.6\u201315.1 L) per minute so it can cut through any stuck-on sludge or roots inside the pipes.",
        "Run the other end of your sewer jetter to the output valve on the pressure washer, which is usually located on the side of the machine.",

        "Look for the water intake valve on the side of the pressure washer, which is usually labeled or has a blue plastic piece around it.",
        "Screw the end of the hose into the valve until it\u2019s hand-tight so water flows through the machine.",
        "Most pressure washer intake valves are made for hoses with a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) diameter.",
        "Check the manual for your pressure washer to see if the valve size uses a different size hose.",
        "Turn on your hose and pressure washer.",
        "Start your hose before turning on the pressure washer, or else you could damage the machine.",
        "Wait for the water to flow out from the end of the leach pipe before you turn you start the pressure washer.",
        "Use the switch on the pressure washer to turn it on before pulling the ripcord to start the engine.",
        "Once the engine is running, the sewer jetter will shoot out high-pressure streams of water forward and backward.",
        "Wear safety glasses while working with a pressure washer so you don\u2019t accidentally spray your eyes.",
        "Push and twist the jetter hose to break apart the clog easier.",
        "As the pressurized water flows through the sewer jetter, it will pull itself further into the leach pipe.",
        "When you feel the hose stop moving, pull it back and twist the hose to direct the stream of water in a different direction.",
        "Push the sewer jetter back against the clog to try and break it apart.",
        "Continue twisting and pushing the jetter hose deeper into the leach pipe until you don\u2019t feel the clog anymore.",
        "If the sewer jetter doesn\u2019t push further into the pipe, then the clog may be too large to break apart.",
        "Either try using a mechanical auger or calling a septic specialist to replace the section of pipe.",
        "Turn off the pressure washer and hose before removing the sewer jetter.",
        "When you\u2019re finished breaking apart the clog, start by turning the switch on the pressure washer to the Off position.",
        "Shut off the water supply for your garden hose and let the remaining water flow out through the sewer jetter.",
        "Slowly pull the sewer jetter back out of the leach field pipe so you don\u2019t damage it or the pipe.",
        "Wear gloves when you remove the sewer jetter since it could be dirty and have bacteria on it.Warning: Don\u2019t pull the sewer jetter out of the leach pipe while it\u2019s running since it will whip around and could hurt you.",
        "Continue cleaning out the other leach field pipes.",
        "Put the nozzle of the sewer jetter into another one of your leach field pipes and repeat the process of cleaning it out.",
        "If you don\u2019t feel any resistance inside the pipe, it may not have a large clog but the pressurized water will still remove sludge or roots that got into the pipes.",
        "Make sure you insert the sewer jetter into the pipe completely before turning it on, and leave it in the pipe until you shut it off.",
        "Even if some of your leach field pipes don\u2019t have clogs, cleaning them will reduce the chance of a clog forming in the future.",
        "Removing Tree Roots Locate and uncover the distribution box for your leach field.",
        "The distribution box for your septic system is usually located past the main tank and connects to all of the leach field pipes.",
        "Check the blueprints for your property to see where the distribution box is in your yard.",
        "Use a shovel to uncover the distribution box before using a pry bar to lift the lid.",
        "If you aren\u2019t able to find the distribution box in your septic system, hire a professional service to locate it for you.Variation: Older septic systems may not have a distribution box.",
        "If that\u2019s the case, then dig holes at the end of each of your leach field\u2019s pipes so you can access them from the other end.",
        "Feed the end of a mechanical auger into one of the leach field pipes.",
        "A mechanical auger has a rotating bit attached to a long snaking cable to cut through overgrown roots and clogs.",

        "Continue feeding the auger snake into the pipe until you meet resistance.",
        "Push and pull the auger back and forth to break apart the roots inside your pipe and cut them loose.",
        "Keep guiding the end of the auger deeper to make sure there aren\u2019t other clogs further inside the pipe.",
        "Some of the roots may get stuck on the end of the auger.",
        "Pull out as many of the roots as you\u2019re able to so they don\u2019t come loose inside your pipe again.",
        "Turn off the auger before you pull out the pipe.",
        "Once you don\u2019t feel any more clogs in the leach field pipe, flip the switch on the auger to the Off position to shut it down.",
        "Wait for it to power down fully before pulling the snake out of the pipe.",
        "Work slowly so the end of the auger doesn\u2019t come out too quickly and hurt you.",
        "Don\u2019t pull the auger out of the pipe while it\u2019s still running since the end may whip around and hurt you.",
        "Flush the pipe with a sewer jetter to pull the roots out.",
        "Attach a sewer jetter to the output valve on a pressure washer and feed the nozzle into your pipe.",

        "Avoid putting chemical cleaners down the drain since they can kill the natural bacteria in your septic system that breaks down solid matter.Warning: Don\u2019t put oil or grease down your drain since they can solidify and cause clogs that are difficult to break apart and remove.",
        "Put copper sulfate into your toilet to kill any roots in the pipes.",
        "Cutting the roots inside your pipes won\u2019t prevent them from regrowing and clogging the system again.",
        "Pour about \u00bd cup (256 g) of copper sulfate into your toilet at a time and keep flushing until they all go down the drain.",
        "Continue adding copper sulfate into your toilet until you\u2019ve flushed about 2 pounds (0.91 kg) into your septic system.",
        "Avoid flushing or running water for 3\u20134 hours after treating the pipes so the compound has time to take effect.",
