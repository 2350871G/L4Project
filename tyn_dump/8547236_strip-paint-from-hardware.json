Remove all supplemental parts, like the spindle and knob of doorknobs, pieces connected by a hinge, and so on. In some cases, you might not be able to completely cut through the paint with your cutting tool. In this situation, score the paint deeply and, when removing the hardware, try to break/tear the paint along the scoring. Peeling is especially common when there is an unbroken layer of paint connecting the surface of your hardware to the surface where the hardware is installed."

Use your utility knife to carve out these slots or to peel away paint so you can remove the fasteners easily. With an appropriate tool, like a screwdriver or claw hammer, take out the fasteners. With screws, use the lightest pressure you can manage while uninstalling. Pressing too hard can cause your screwdriver to slip and result in gouged hardware."

Your hardware may still be hot when you go to remove it from the crock pot. Use tongs to prevent yourself from getting burned. After a night of soaking in hot, soapy water, the paint on your hardware should be soft and ready to fall off. Use an old crock pot or buy one secondhand at a thrift store for your paint removal.
