Position it at the back of the bed and center it. Then bolt it down. Wheel chocks are available at automotive stores or online. Some trailers have holes for attachments like wheel chocks already in place. Look for pre-made holes for the bolts. You can also install a wheel chock temporarily if you don\u2019t want to worry about attaching screws and bolts. Position it the same way, then tie it down with ratchet straps.

Roll the bike to the back of the trailer and rest the front wheel in the chock. On most chocks, the mechanism clicks when the front wheel fully enters it. When you hear this click, the bike is in the correct position. Do not lower the kickstand. You can put it out temporarily while you gather your equipment, but raise it before you tie the bike down. Securing the Front Wheel Hold the bike upright. If you\u2019re working with another person, this job is much easier. Have them hold the bike straight upright, without leaning towards one side.

Wrapping the Rear Tire Tie a strap parallel with the rear tire. When the front tire is done, move on to the rear tire. Line up the strap with the rear tire, on either side, and tie it to the trailer at this point. If the trailer has hooks or other tie-down attachments, secure the strap to this point. Wrap the strap around the rear tire. Pull the strap towards the tire and loop it through. Wrap the tire with one complete rotation, then pull the strap towards the other side of the trailer. Make sure you only wrap the strap around the tire, not around any spokes. Attach the strap to a ratchet strap on the opposite side of the trailer. Tie the ratchet strap to the opposite side of the trailer. Then loop the strap through the ratchet. Crank it to tighten the strap, and continue until it pulls taut. Tie down the loose strap ends so they don\u2019t flail. Flailing straps can damage your car and motorcycle if you drive at high speeds. Finish the job by securing all the ends. Either tie them to the trailer, or loop them around the tightened strap portion and tie a knot. Monitor the straps as you drive.
