However if you don't have a garden or this is impractical you can have an indoor altar. If your altar will be indoors, choose a room to have it in.

Another popular choice is North or North-East, and many Pagans instinctively pick it. Lots of rituals are said to start with the practitioner facing North. You can also have your altar in the direction of your element. So air for east, fire for south, water for west, north for earth and center for spirit."

Other places are drawers, bookcases (though this means you can't have candles under the wood), trays, tree stumps and windowsills. You can also have an altar box, so your objects are kept safe and private from others if you live in a busy household. You can take the items out and place them on top of the box when in use. Choose somewhere that feels right for you. Use your intuition."

You can also use totem animals of the goddess like a hare, cat, owl or other lunar animals. Something that may represent feminine elements. For example, water = chalice or bowl of water, seashell, cauldron, sea glass or mirror, earth = green/brown coloured objects, stones, plants (leaves, flowers, etc), salt, soil, bones or pentagram.
