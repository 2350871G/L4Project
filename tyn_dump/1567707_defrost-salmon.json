        "If you\u2019re defrosting 1 or a few pieces from a larger package, remove the ones you want, reseal the packaging, and return it to the freezer.",
        "Microwave defrosting is the quickest method, but it\u2019s not highly recommended.",
        "The salmon will certainly be safe to cook and eat, but it may end up tough and dry or unevenly heated.",
        "Place the frozen salmon on a dish between 2 pieces of paper towel.",
        "Use a microwave-safe dish that\u2019s large enough to fit all of the salmon pieces side-by-side.",
        "Line the bottom of the dish with a few pieces of paper towel to catch the melting ice crystals.",
        "Place the salmon directly onto the paper towel-lined dish, and cover it with another piece of paper towel.",
        "Position the thickest parts of the fish towards the outside edges of the dish and the thinnest parts toward the center so the whole piece defrosts evenly.",
        "Use the microwave\u2019s defrost setting to gradually heat the fish.",
        "Each microwave will be slightly different but start by hitting the defrost button.",
        "Then, if prompted, enter either the weight of your salmon or the amount of time you want the microwave to run.",
        "Aim to warm up the salmon for 4 to 5 minutes per 1 lb (0.45 kg) of fish you\u2019re defrosting.",
        "The defrost setting is usually 30% of the microwave's heating power, so if you don\u2019t have a defrost feature, set the controls to 30% or Power 3.",
        "Pause the microwave halfway through to flip over the salmon.",
        "If you\u2019re defrosting a 1 lb (0.45 kg) piece of salmon, open the microwave door about 2.5 minutes through the defrosting sequence.",
        "Carefully flip the salmon over so that the bottom side faces the top.",
        "This will help it thaw out more evenly.",
        "Then close the door and allow the microwave to continue the cycle.",
        "Wash your hands with soap after handling the raw, partially-thawed fish.",
        "Remove the salmon from the microwave before it\u2019s totally thawed.",
        "Stop defrosting the fish when it\u2019s mostly pliable but still contains a few frozen patches.",
        "Feel the fish to check on its progress.",
        "If needed, keep defrosting it for 30 seconds at a time until it reaches this stage.",
        "After handling the raw seafood, wash your hands thoroughly with soap.",
        "Avoid overdoing the microwave defrosting.",
        "If you keep it in for too long, it may start to cook unevenly or dry out.",
        "Let the salmon sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before cooking it.",
        "Instead of totally defrosting it in the microwave, take the salmon out of the microwave and allow the heat to work through the fish while it rests at room temperature.",
        "Wait about 5 minutes for the frozen patches to thaw out.",
        "Then immediately cook the salmon.",
        "Feel free to cook the salmon in the microwave or in the oven."
