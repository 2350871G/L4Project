If yours doesn't have an igniter, you'll need to use a striker to light the torch. If you need low heat, opt for a propane torch with a flame-spreading tip, which will allow you to diffuse the flame to lower its heat. When using a high heat for repairing chain-link fences and the like, consider using an oxygen-fuel torch. These torches have 2 separate tanks for gas (usually propane or MAPP) and oxygen."

        "When the flux sizzles and smokes slightly, the pipe is ready for solder.",
        "Be cautious when handling heated pipe.",
        "Touching this could result in accidental burn in the same way touching the flame of your torch would.",
        "Keep the flame of your torch set to a moderate or low setting when heating flux.",
        "You only need a relatively low temperature to melt it.",
        "Assemble the pipe components and heat them.",
        "Use caution when assembling pipe components so as to not burn yourself on the heated part.",
        "Slide the pipe into the fitting until it can go no further.",
        "Twist the pipe back and forth in the fitting to spread the flux on the inside of the joint.",
        "Then use your torch to reheat the assembled components.",
        "Pass the flame of your torch evenly back and forth over the pipe components.",
        "Failing to heat these evenly could cause your solder to melt unevenly, allowing water to leak.",
        "Apply solder to the pipe.",
        "Hold your solder to the heated pipe.",
        "If the solder runs, your pipe components are sufficiently hot enough to begin soldering.",
        "If your components glow or turn a blue color, you've applied too much heat.",
        "If you've applied too much heat to your pipe, wait for it to cool completely.",
        "When the pipe is cool, try again by repeating this process from the beginning.",
        "Clean the pipe after soldering.",
        "While the pipe is still warm but the solder solid, brush another thin layer of flux on the solder.",
        "After that, use a clean cloth to wipe the soldered joint clean.",
        "Do not try to cool the joint rapidly.",
        "Doing so could cause damage to it.",
        "Avoid tightening the fixture or moving the joint around until the solder has completely cooled.",
        "The solder will remain soft until it is cool.",
        "Troubleshooting Your Torch Avoid tipping the torch more than 60\u00b0 from upright.",
        "Tipping your torch in this fashion can cause the torch to flare.",
        "This can be especially dangerous on windy days.",
        "The wind could cause the flame to jump to the surrounding area and start a fire.",
        "Recognize the effect of temperature on your torch flame.",
        "If you use your torch in cold weather and if your torch is not pressure regulated, you may notice that the flame is smaller than usual.",
        "Cold temperatures reduce the amount of pressure in the tank, resulting in a smaller flame.",
        "Keep your tank in a warm, indoor area and use it quickly and efficiently when out in the cold to maintain a suitable flame.",
        "Using a pressure regulated torch will also prevent a small flame due to temperature.",
        "Check your torch for leaks.",
        "If you hear a hissing noise of gas escaping your torch even while the valve is off, it likely has a leak.",
        "You may also notice that your torch is losing fuel even when not in use, which is another sign of a leak.",
        "In a well ventilated, spark free area where there are no open flames, open the valve of your torch but do not ignite it.",
        "Use dish soap and water on all connections.",
        "If you see bubbles form, you have a leak.",
        "Send in your torch for repairs.",
        "Many torches are designed to absorb drop impact so as to prevent damage to the pressurized fuel cylinder.",
        "This can sometimes result in your torch breaking off at the airholes when dropped, or another component being damaged.",
        "A damaged torch can be severely dangerous; send your torch into the manufacturer for repairs.",
        "The customer service number for your torch can often be found in the user manual or on the manufacturer's website.",
        "Customer service should be able to inform you of the proper process for repair."
