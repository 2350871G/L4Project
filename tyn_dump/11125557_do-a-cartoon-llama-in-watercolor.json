To make a neck, stand the hot dog on end and draw it at the edge of the potato. For the head, turn a strawberry (minus the green husk) sideways, and place it atop the hot dog shape.

Complete the head by adding two pointed ears standing upright, eyes with long curly eyelashes, and,finally, a nose and mouth. If you wish, scribble a little tuft of hair between his ears. Adding the Background and Details Draw the flower baskets the llama is carrying, one completely visible and just a peek at the second one. Place two straps across the llama's back to hold them in place. Fill the basket with flowers. Any flower shape will work just fine. Little curly circles with dots for the center are simple and pretty and recognizable as a simple flower.
