They range in length from 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 6 inches (15.2 cm) and are meatier than spare ribs. Spare ribs are from the section of the rib cage under the back ribs. Spare-rib meat often is tenderer than back ribs because of its high fat content."

Gas or propane grill: Create an indirect heat source by lighting only about half of the burners. Put the wood chips in a smoking box and place the box between the flame and the grill surface. Charcoal grill: After ash forms, move the briquettes to one side of the grill. Place 2 or 3 wood chunks on the coals. Put a small baking pan with about 1 inch (2.54 cm) of water in it on the cool side of the grill. The steam from the water helps keep the rib meat moist and tender."

Recipes vary in the amount of time it takes to grill ribs, but spare ribs often take longer than back ribs. Ways to tell if you ribs are ready include:\nMeat thermometer: Rib meat should be about 180 degrees F (82.2 degrees C) when it's done. However, it can sometimes be difficult to get an accurate reading because the meat is so thin. Visual inspection: Ribs should be a rich brown color and slightly crusty. Tenderness test: Use tongs and pick up the ribs at the center of the slab. If the meat slumps and cracks from the bone, your ribs are ready."
