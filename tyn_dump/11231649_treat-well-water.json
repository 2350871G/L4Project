Then, pull the steel tape up so the bottom is even with the top of the water. Subtract the depth of the water level from the total depth so you know how much water your well\u2019s holding. Find the diameter of the well and check a table to determine how much water is in your well in gallons per foot of depth. You can find a table for measuring water volume in a well here: http://www.geotechenv.com/Reference_Pages/water_measure_tables.pdf. For example, if the depth of the water in your well is 20 feet (6.1 m) and the diameter is 6 inches (15 cm), then your well holds 1.469 gallons (5.56 L) of water for each foot. Multiply the volume of water you found by the number of feet in your well to get 29.38 gallons (111.2 L) total. If you can\u2019t find the volume of the well yourself, then you need to call a well specialist to determine it for you."

Follow the instructions for installing the water softener carefully since the ports may depend on the type of system you have. If you have a salt-free water softener, then you don\u2019t have to connect it to a brine tank. Water runs between the brine tank and the main softener to help circulate and store soft water. Run a waste water hose from the water softener to a drain. Water softeners need to drain waste water that contains contaminants so they don\u2019t cycle back into your pipes. Find the waste water port on top of the softener and run a hose from it to a floor drain or utility sink so the water can escape. Make sure the end of the hose is 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the drain so the water can\u2019t accidentally enter the hose again.",
