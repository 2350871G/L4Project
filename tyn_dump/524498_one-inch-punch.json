                    "description": "The one-inch punch is thusly named because the punch is thrown from an inch - actually, three to six inches, if you count the width of your fist. To execute the punch, it's necessary to be quite close to the person or object you're punching. Gauge the distance by stretching out your arm toward your target; your elbow should be slightly bent at a bit less than a 45-degree angle. If you can straighten your arm without touching it, you're too far away; you'll have to lunge forward to hit your target, which will take away from the force of your punch. Move a little closer. If your elbow is bent at a right angle, or close to it, you need to step back a bit. The term \"one-inch\" is actually an estimate here. The point is to punch from a very close distance, not from exactly one inch. After practicing the punch a few times, you should be able to figure out the right distance from your target without having to extend your arm beforehand.
