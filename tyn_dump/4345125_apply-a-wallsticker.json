Make sure the wall sticker goes onto a wall with the paint coating over it in fairly cured and strong form. One other thing is that getting a wall sticker onto a coarse textured wall surface is going to be tricky. The vinyl of the wall sticker wouldn\u2019t properly adhere to the wall surface. A proper bonding is always obtained on a smooth surface. Now that those are considered, and you\u2019ve finalized on your wall and you\u2019re bent on the transformation, keep in mind that a dust covered wall isn\u2019t one of those things you\u2019d want when you get a wall sticker on. The dust reduces the sticker adhesion."

Now, use a slightly blunt edged object such as a credit card to squeegee out all the air bubbles stuck between the wall and the application tape. Make sure you go over and over again as you smoothen out the application tape with the squeegee, removing as much air bubbles as you can. Now you\u2019re all ready for the last move."
