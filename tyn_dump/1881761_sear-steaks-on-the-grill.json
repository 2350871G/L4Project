Searing Steaks on the Grill Get the cooking grate as close to the coals as possible. Placing the grate 2 to 3 inches above the coals will create high direct heat for searing your steaks.

Coat the grate with nonstick cooking spray before you light the coals. Then, light the coals directly or light them using a charcoal starter. Allow the temperature to reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 C) before placing the steaks on the grill. Place the steaks on the grill rack. The number of steaks that you can sear at one time will depend on both the size of your grill and the size of your steaks. Make sure that you leave at least a 2\u201d (5 centimeter) clearance around the meat for even cooking. Cook the steak for 1-1/2 minutes before flipping it over using a pair of tongs.
