However, if you plan to do lots of freeze drying, you can buy a freeze dryer that\u2019s made for home use. Once you buy the machine, read the instructions to make sure you\u2019re using it properly."

To get your flowers to open up more, try recutting their stems and letting them drink warm water. Use a deep vase so that flowers have a lot of water to help them open. You can freeze dry most kinds of flowers that are found in bouquets."

It\u2019s okay if the flowers touch each other, but it\u2019s best to have them spaced out on the trays. Most freeze dryer machines can freeze about three trays at once, so there\u2019s no need to crowd all your flowers onto one tray.
