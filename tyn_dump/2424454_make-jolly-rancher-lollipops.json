You can create long, rectangular lollipops by lining up 5 pieces instead of 3. Consider alternating the colors, such as red and green, or pink and blue. You can turn these rectangles into lilies by rolling them into cones once the candy melts. To make daisies, arrange 5 to 6 Jolly Ranchers in a circle. You are creating something that looks like a star. There will be a gap in the middle of your star. You can leave the gap as is, or fill it with another hard candy, such as a Life Saver. When the candies melt, the candy will flatten out. The \"rays\" will look like petals."

This creates a secure bond.If you made rectangular lollipops with 5 pieces, then place the lollipop stick into one of the narrow ends of the rectangle. Because this is a bigger piece, you can put more of the lollipop stick into the candy. If you are making daisies, insert the lollipop stick between two petals. Try to make the top of the stick go all the way to the center of the flower. If you are making lilies, insert the lollipop stick into the wide end of the rectangle, then roll the rectangle into a cone. After you have inserted the lollipop sticks, but before the candy hardens, consider decorating it further with some sprinkles or other candies."

You can transfer the caramel into a clean bowl or you can leave it in the pot. Consider adding some water, milk, heavy whipping cream, or butter to your caramel. This will make it either thinner or thicker; it can also enrich the flavor. Remember, the more milk or water you add, the softer and thinner your caramel will be when it hardens again. Consider further enhancing your caramel by adding a few drops of vanilla extract. You can also melt your caramel in a melting pot, a double boiler, or in the microwave."

Do this quickly, before the caramel hardens. For a less nutty lollipop, you can lay the lollipops on a flat surface, and sprinkle some crumbled walnuts or pecans onto the caramel part before it hardens.

    "text": " Making Basic Jolly Rancher Lollipops Set your oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). In order to make Jolly Rancher lollipops, you will need to melt the Jolly Ranchers. Turn on your oven and set it to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). This will be hot enough for the Jolly Ranchers to melt once you put them inside. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and parchment paper. The aluminum foil will prevent your baking sheet from getting sticky or ruined, and the parchment paper will make it easier to remove the lollipops once they have cooled. Place the parchment paper on top of the aluminum, and lightly grease your parchment paper with shortening or cooking spray. This will help the lollipops from sticking. Unwrap some Jolly Ranchers and place them on the parchment paper in small groups. Arrange the groups in rows, and leave enough room for some lollipop sticks. Each group should have 2 to 3 candies. You can create long, rectangular lollipops by lining up 5 pieces instead of 3. Consider alternating the colors, such as red and green, or pink and blue. You can turn these rectangles into lilies by rolling them into cones once the candy melts. To make daisies, arrange 5 to 6 Jolly Ranchers in a circle. You are creating something that looks like a star. There will be a gap in the middle of your star. You can leave the gap as is, or fill it with another hard candy, such as a Life Saver. When the candies melt, the candy will flatten out. The \"rays\" will look like petals. Carefully place the baking sheet into the oven. Let the Jolly Ranchers bake for about 6 to 8 minutes or until melted. The Jolly Ranchers will spread and flatten out into rounded squares or circles. Keep an eye on the candy, however, as each oven is different, and your candy might melt sooner. Take the tray out of the oven. Once the candy has melted, take the tray out of the oven and set it down on a stable, heat-resistant surface. You may have to take the candy out in less than 6 minutes. Insert the lollipop sticks. Take the lollipop sticks and start laying them down into the melted Jolly Ranchers. You want just the first inch or two of the lollypop stick to be inside the melted Jolly Rancher. Twist the lollipop stick slightly as you are laying it into the melted candy. This creates a secure bond.If you made rectangular lollipops with 5 pieces, then place the lollipop stick into one of the narrow ends of the rectangle. Because this is a bigger piece, you can put more of the lollipop stick into the candy. If you are making daisies, insert the lollipop stick between two petals. Try to make the top of the stick go all the way to the center of the flower. If you are making lilies, insert the lollipop stick into the wide end of the rectangle, then roll the rectangle into a cone. After you have inserted the lollipop sticks, but before the candy hardens, consider decorating it further with some sprinkles or other candies. Wait for the candy to cool. Leave the lollipops undisturbed on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, or until they have cooled off and hardened. Remove the candy from the baking sheet. If there is any residue left behind from the shortening or cooking spray, then wipe it off with a cloth. Store your Jolly Rancher lollipops. Once you have finished making your lollipops, you will need to store them in a cool, dry place so that they don't get sticky. Keep them in a sealed container, or wrap them in cellophane bags and tie them off with string. If you made Jolly Rancher flowers, consider tying a short, green ribbon around the lollipop stick to resemble leaves, and place the lollipop in a small vase. You can use it as decorations or favors at a party. Making Caramel Apple Lollipops Preheat your oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Turn on your oven and set the temperature to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Prepare your baking sheet with aluminum foil and parchment paper. Select a large baking sheet and cover it with aluminum foil to protect it. Then, place a sheet of parchment paper on top. Lightly grease the parchment paper with shortening or cooking spray. Select the green Jolly Ranchers. Open your bag of Jolly Ranchers and find the green ones. These are apple-flavored, and you will need them to make your caramel apple lollipops. Unwrap the candy and discard the wrappers. Place the candy on the baking sheet. Arrange the candy in groups of 2 to 3 on your baking sheet. The candies should be placed side by side, and resemble squares or rectangles. Remember to leave space for lollipop sticks. Place the baking sheet in the oven. Let the candy bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the candy has melted. The melted Jolly Ranchers will be thin, and look like rounded squares or circles. Take the baking sheet out of the oven. Set the sheet down on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Leave the candy undisturbed while it cools. This will take about 5 minutes. Melt some caramel. Take a small, clean pot and drop some hard, caramel candy into it. You can also use caramel melting bits, found in the baking department of a supermarket, instead. Turn on the stove, and wait until the caramel melts. Once the caramel has melted, take the pot off the stove and set it down onto a stable, heat-resistant surface. You can transfer the caramel into a clean bowl or you can leave it in the pot. Consider adding some water, milk, heavy whipping cream, or butter to your caramel. This will make it either thinner or thicker; it can also enrich the flavor. Remember, the more milk or water you add, the softer and thinner your caramel will be when it hardens again. Consider further enhancing your caramel by adding a few drops of vanilla extract. You can also melt your caramel in a melting pot, a double boiler, or in the microwave. Dip the Jolly Rancher lollipops into the caramel. You can dip the entire candy into the caramel, or just the top half. Turn the lollipop stick between your fingers so that the caramel covers the entire candy, and wipe the excess caramel off on the side of the pot or bowl Work quickly, as the hot caramel may cause the candy to start melting again.For additional flavor, dip the caramel apple lollipops into a bowl of crumbled walnuts or pecans. Do this quickly, before the caramel hardens. For a less nutty lollipop, you can lay the lollipops on a flat surface, and sprinkle some crumbled walnuts or pecans onto the caramel part before it hardens. Consider drizzling some melted chocolate over the caramel. Lay the Jolly Rancher lollipops on a baking sheet and let the caramel harden. Once you have covered the candy with caramel, set the lollipop down on a baking sheet and leave it some place where it won't be disturbed until the caramel cools off and hardens. Store your lollipops some place cool and dry. Once the caramel has set, you will need to store your lollipops in a cool, dry location. You can store them in an air-tight container, or wrap them in cellophane. Making Tie-dye Jolly Rancher Lollipops Preheat your oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Before you start making your Jolly Rancher lollipops, turn on your oven and set the temperature to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Cover your baking sheet with aluminum foil and parchment paper. You will need to protect your baking sheet by covering it with some aluminum foil. Once you have covered your baking sheet, place a sheet of parchment paper on top of it. Lightly grease the parchment paper with shortening or cooking spray. Place the candy in a bag. Take some unwrapped Jolly Ranchers and place them in a plastic, resealable bag. You can protect the bag from breaking by placing a towel over it. Consider separating your candy by color, and put the individual colors into separate bags. Smash the candy into smaller pieces. Take a hammer, mallet, or rolling pin, and start crushing the candy. You want the break the candy up into chunks, and not a powder. Place the candy bits on the baking sheet in small groups. Take a few candy pieces and place them on the baking sheet. You want to make little patches of color. Make sure to leave enough room to insert some lollipop sticks later. Put the baking sheet into the oven. Let the candy bake until it is melted. This can take anywhere between 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the sizes of your candy bits. Watch your candy carefully, so that you don't over bake it. The different pieces will melt and fuse together, reacting a tie-dye or kaleidoscopic effect. Take the baking sheet out of the oven. Once the candy has melted into thin circles or patches, take the baking sheet out of the oven and set it down onto a stable, heat-resistant surface. Insert the lollipop sticks. Start laying the lollipop sticks down onto the candy. You want just the first inch or two of the lollipop stick to be inserted. When laying down the lollipop sticks, give them a slight twist. This helps create a better, more secure bond. Work quickly, before the candy hardens. Before the candy hardens, but after you have already inserted the lollipop sticks, consider decorating the lollipop further with some sugar sprinkles. Wait for the candy to harden. Leave your baking sheet some place where it won't be disturbed, and let the candy harden. This will take about 5 minutes. Take the candy off the baking sheet. Once the candy hardens, you can take the lollipop off the baking sheet. If there is grease residue on the candy, you can wipe it off with a cloth. Store the lollipops. Once you have finished making your candy, you will need to store it some place cool and dry. You can either wrap the lollipops in cellophane, or store them in an air-tight container. Making Shaped Jolly Rancher Lollipops Preheat your oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Before you start making your lollipops, turn on your oven and set the temperature to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Prepare your baking sheet for baking with some aluminum foil and parchment paper. Cover your baking sheet with some aluminum foil, and lay a piece of parchment paper over it. Lightly grease the parchment paper with shortening or cooking spray. Prepare your cookie cutters and place them on the tray. In order to make shaped Jolly Rancher lollipops, you will need some cookie cutters. Choose metal ones that can withstand high temperatures, and lightly grease the inside with shortening or cooking spray. Once you have greased your cookie cutters, place them onto the baking sheet. Many cookie cutters will have some sort of ledge or lip\u2014this part should be sticking up, and the sharper side should be touching the tray. Place the candy into the cookie cutters. Take 2 to 3 Jolly Ranchers and place them into the cookie cutters; you may need to use more or fewer candies depending on the size of the cookie cutter. You can use all one color, or multiple colors. Put the baking sheet into the oven. Let the candy bake until it melts. This can take between 6 to 8 minutes. Watch your oven carefully, so that you don't scorch your candy. Take the sheet out of the oven. Once the candy has melted, take the baking sheet out of the oven and set it down onto a stable, heat-resistant surface. Pop the candy out of the cookie cutters. Working quickly, but carefully, pop the candy out of the cookie cutters. If the candy is too runny and starts to lose its form, wait a moment or two. You may have to use a knife or spoon to help pop the candy out. When you have popped the candy out of the cookie cutter, place it onto the baking sheet. Insert the lollipop sticks. Start laying the lollipop sticks down onto the candy. You want just the first inch or two of the lollipop stick to be inserted. When laying down the lollipop sticks, give them a slight twist. This helps create a better, more secure bond. Work quickly, before the candy hardens. Wait for the candy to cool off. Leave your tray on a stable, heat-resistant surface, and let the candy cool until it hardens. This will take about 5 minutes. Take the candy off the baking sheet. Once the candy cools off, you can take the lollipop off the baking sheet. If there is grease residue on the candy, you can wipe it off with a cloth. Put your finished lollipops some place cool and dry. Once you have finished making your candy, you will need to store properly so that it doesn't become sticky and gooey. Choose a cool, dry location. You can either keep the lollipops in an air-tight container, or wrap them in cellophane. Making Molded Jolly Rancher Lollipops Prepare your supplies in advance. Once the candy melts, you will have to work quickly, so it is a good idea to have everything you need on hand, including: the candy, lollipop sticks, a spoon or spatula, and the mold. Select a mold for the candy. You can either use a plastic candy-making mold with grooves for lollipop sticks, or you can modify a silicon ice cube mold. If you wish to use a silicon ice cube mold, make shallow slits along the edges of each shape. Do not make the slits too deep; you still want the bottom portion of the mold left whole. Insert the lollipop sticks into the mold. Place the lollipop sticks into the slit of each mold. Only the first inch or two of the lollipop stick should be in the mold; the rest should be sticking out. You may see a slight gap between the mold and the candy. Don't worry if you do. This will not cause the candy to spill out; the melted candy is thick and it hardens quickly. Place some candies into a pot. Select several candies that are the same color/flavor, unwrap them, and place them into a small cooking pot. Place the pot on the burner and turn on the stove. Heat the candy and wait until it melts. Watch the pot carefully, so that you do not scorch the candy. Pour the candy into the molds. Once the candy has melted, take the pot off the stove, and pour the liquid into the molds. If necessary, use a spoon or spatula to help guide the melted candy into the mold. Wait for the candy to harden. Leave the mold undisturbed while the candy cools. This will take at least 15 to 20 minutes. After that, place the mold into the freezer for 10 minutes. Remove the mold from the freezer and pop the candy out. Once the candy has fully cooled and hardened, pull the mold out of the freezer and pop the candy out of the mold. Put the lollipops in a cool, dry location. You can either wrap the finished lollipops with cellophane, or you can place them into an air-tight container. Keep the lollipops some place cool and dry to prevent them from becoming sticky.",

        "Select a mold for the candy.",
        "You can either use a plastic candy-making mold with grooves for lollipop sticks, or you can modify a silicon ice cube mold.",
        "If you wish to use a silicon ice cube mold, make shallow slits along the edges of each shape.",
        "Do not make the slits too deep; you still want the bottom portion of the mold left whole.",
        "Insert the lollipop sticks into the mold.",
        "Place the lollipop sticks into the slit of each mold.",
        "Only the first inch or two of the lollipop stick should be in the mold; the rest should be sticking out.",
        "You may see a slight gap between the mold and the candy.",
        "Don't worry if you do.",
        "This will not cause the candy to spill out; the melted candy is thick and it hardens quickly.",
        "Place some candies into a pot.",
        "Select several candies that are the same color/flavor, unwrap them, and place them into a small cooking pot.",
        "Place the pot on the burner and turn on the stove.",
        "Heat the candy and wait until it melts.",
        "Watch the pot carefully, so that you do not scorch the candy.",
        "Pour the candy into the molds.",
        "Once the candy has melted, take the pot off the stove, and pour the liquid into the molds.",
        "If necessary, use a spoon or spatula to help guide the melted candy into the mold.",
        "Wait for the candy to harden.",
        "Leave the mold undisturbed while the candy cools.",
        "This will take at least 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "After that, place the mold into the freezer for 10 minutes.",
        "Remove the mold from the freezer and pop the candy out.",
        "Once the candy has fully cooled and hardened, pull the mold out of the freezer and pop the candy out of the mold.",
        "Put the lollipops in a cool, dry location.",
        "You can either wrap the finished lollipops with cellophane, or you can place them into an air-tight container.",
        "Keep the lollipops some place cool and dry to prevent them from becoming sticky."
