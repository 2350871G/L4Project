A bore for a .22 caliber handgun is going to be a different length and width than one meant for a 12 gauge shotgun. The caliber is the size of the bore in the gun. If the calibers don\u2019t match, then the snake won\u2019t clean the bore out enough and could possibly  get stuck in it. Boresnakes are available online and at many gun shops. The type of gun the boresnake is compatible with will be listed on the packaging. Many manufacturers also stamp the caliber rating on the snake itself. If you have multiple guns, you'll need a different snake for each one unless they are the same caliber."
