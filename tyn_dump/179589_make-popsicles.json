    "text": " Making Popsicles Using Molds Invest in molds. Popsicle trays create the best results, while ice cube trays make miniature ice pops. The molds should be freezer-safe, preferably hard plastic. Create your mixture. Popsicles don't have to be just juice. Experiment with different varieties of drinks, by making gatorade popsicles, pudding popsicles, smoothie popsicles, or ice cube popsicles. Fill each mold about 3/4 full. You don't want to overfill it because the mixture will expand while freezing. It also may make it harder for you to get it out of the mold if overfilled. Cover the molds/cups with wrap. Aluminum foil works best, but you can also use plastic wrap. Be sure that it's on tightly. Push a popsicle stick directly in the middle of the mold. Make sure it touches the bottom of it. The foil or wrap should hold the popsicle stick in its place. Place the pops in the freezer for a few hours overnight or until the popsicles are solid. Check on it at intervals if desired. Finished. Serve as needed. Making Popsicles Without Molds Get a cup or glass. Choose paper or plastic cups, or use yogurt containers or similar. Be sure to clean them out if they've been used before. Whatever you use must be able to handle being placed in the freezer. Fill the cup most of the way. Fill with a smoothie, flavored milk or a juice (or combination of juices) of your choice. Cover the top with aluminum foil.  Poke a hole in the foil with a popsicle stick. Leave the stick in the cup or glass. Repeat as many times as you like.  Put the popsicles in the freezer. Leave overnight. Take out your delicious treat, and enjoy!  Making Lazy Popsicle Yogurt or Pudding Popsicles Purchase a six-pack of flavored yogurt or dessert pudding.  Find six sticks. Use chopsticks, skewers, etc. Pierce a hole in the middle of each lid. Push the stick through and rest almost at the base of the container but not quite. Repeat for each container until all six have sticks poking out of them. Place in the freezer. Leave to freeze overnight. Serve.
