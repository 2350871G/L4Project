Cleaning Oil-Based Paints from Rollers Remove excess paint from the roller by rolling it back and forth on the paint pan or onto several layers of old newspapers.  Pour mineral spirits or turpentine (also called paint thinners) into a clean roller paint pan to clean your roller brushes. Add enough thinner for it to fill the pan about 3\" (7.62 cm) deep.
