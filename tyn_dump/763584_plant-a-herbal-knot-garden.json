Take into consideration the type of herbs that you wish to grow, their growing size and needs, their compatibility, etc. when you are designing the shape. Look at basic knot garden designs in a gardening book to get ideas for the possible shapes. It is a good idea to keep it simple; the more complicated designs are better suited to hedge plants."
