Trace around your hand, leaving a 1-inch (1.27-centimeter) space around it. Don't make the base too narrow, or you will have troubles slipping the mitten on and off. Cut the pattern out when you are done. Use regular scissors to cut the pattern, not your fabric scissors. You are adding the extra space for wiggle room and seam allowance. Keep your lines and curves smooth. You don't have to make the little bumps for the fingers. Think: basic mitten shape."
