Make it part of your beach visit to collect at least 5 minutes worth of rubbish off the beach before you leave. Always dispose of your rubbish bag in a proper place of disposal. If you cannot find a proper bin near the beach, take the rubbish home and dispose of it using your own waste disposal methods."

            "description": "While showing by example, also encourage them to do the same. Teach children how to safely pick up rubbish without harming themselves. If an area is known for drug use, don't have children picking up rubbish. For yourself, wear solid shoes to avoid getting an accidental needlestick injury. And wear proper gloves and carry mechanical litter pick-up devices. Teach children to never stick their fingers inside anything, be it a container, shell or whatever else that creates a possible hiding spot for an animal that might sting, bite or shoot barbs. Some animals, such as the blue ringed octopus, live inside human rubbish like drink cans and can deliver a fatal bite or sting if handled unawares."

You can often become part of the cleanup operations by joining groups that need and train volunteers in cleaning birds, cleaning the sand, and other helpful ways of cleaning up. Check the websites of local conservation organizations and local government environment sites for details specific to the event as it happens."
