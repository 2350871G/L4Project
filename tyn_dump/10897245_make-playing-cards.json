This works best for printing black and white cards. Color printing will wear off faster after frequent use and shuffling. You can get cardstock at an office supply or print shop. You can use this technique to create any kind of custom playing cards you want, from normal poker-style cards, to homemade card games.

Make sure to orient the cardstock so that the back design prints the way you want it to. You can run a regular piece of printing paper through the printer first to test how it prints. Cutting Out the Playing Cards Use a ruler and pencil to draw lines between the cards to cut along. Place the ruler horizontally between each row of cards and draw a line along it with a pencil. Do the same vertically between each column of cards. Alternatively, you can put some light-colored lines in between the cards in the design file on your computer before you print them. Cut along the lines with a paper cutter to separate the cards. It's easiest to separate the cardstock into 4 quadrants by making 1 vertical cut and 1 horizontal cut first.

If you don't have a paper cutter, you can use a ruler and a utility knife to cut along the lines. Round the corners with a corner rounding tool for a more professional look. Insert the corner of a card into the tool and press the button down to clip it. Repeat this for every corner. This will also help the cards shuffle better.
