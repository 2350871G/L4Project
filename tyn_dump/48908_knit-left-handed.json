Tug the tail of the yarn to tighten the base of the slip knot. This slip knot will count as your first cast on stitch. Loop the yarn over the end of the right hand-needle. Hold 1 knitting needle in each hand. Position your thumb and index finger about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the tips of the needles. Then, bring the working yarn over the end of the right-hand needle.
