For this method, you'll need:\na heat gun that heats to at least 200 degrees C\npaper towel and toilet paper tubes of the same diameter\naluminum foil\nan oven bag, also known as a turkey bag\na tea ball\ntwist ties\na funnel or coffee percolator small enough to nest in the paper towel tube"

Opinions vary among smokers regarding whether or not heated aluminum foil is actually safe, or whether it gives off harmful vapors of its own.
