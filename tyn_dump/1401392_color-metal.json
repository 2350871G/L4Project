Depending on the material, you can search for a patina recipe to create the color you are looking for or purchase one over the counter. For a green verdigris patina, add three parts apple cider vinegar to one part salt. For a black patina, add sulfur of liver (sulfurated potash) to warm water.

The voltage you use will depend on the surface area of the metal you are using. Check the power supply. Start with a low voltage of about 2 amps, then increase the voltage up to 10-12 amps after a few minutes. Anodize aluminum for 60 minutes. Negatively charged aluminum will attract positively charged sulfuric acid. You will notice a lot of bubbles around the piece of scrap metal, but very little bubbling around the metal you are anodizing. Remove the metal piece and rinse thoroughly with water. Be careful not to let any acid drip off the piece. You may want to the hold the container containing your neutralizing solution beneath the metal as you move it to the sink. Hold the metal beneath the water for several minutes while rotating to clean each side thoroughly. Prepare the dye. Prepare a solution of fiber dye and distilled water in portions to reach the color you want in a separate container. Follow any manufacturer instructions for the particular dye you have purchased. Place the metal object into dye bath for up to 20 minutes. Depending on the desired color, you may only need to leave the metal in the bath for a minute or two. You can also gently heat the dye bath to help speed up the process. At first, you may have difficulty getting the precise color, so plan on trying out the process on a few practice pieces made of the same material first. The dye can be reused several times, so if you want you can store the dye in a plastic container after you've finished this dyeing session. Boil the object in water for 30 minutes to seal the color. Heat the water in a pot. Then immerse the object into the boiling water. The process will seal the dyes, but it will also cause them to fade slightly. This is another reason why it's a good idea to do at least one test piece first. Allow the object to cool. Remove the object from the hot water. Set it on a towel to cool for several minutes. Once the object is completely cool, the metal will be at its permanent new color. Clean all tools and containers with baking soda neutralizing solution. Rinse everything and be sure that none of the acid remains on anything that was in contact with it throughout the process. Creating Patinas Create a patina mixture. There are many different recipes to create different patinas. Patinas change the color by creating a chemical reaction with the metal to create a colored film over the surface. You can use a patina on any copper or bronze metal to give the surface an aged color and appearance similar to the green coloring of the Statue of Liberty. Depending on the material, you can search for a patina recipe to create the color you are looking for or purchase one over the counter. For a green verdigris patina, add three parts apple cider vinegar to one part salt. For a black patina, add sulfur of liver (sulfurated potash) to warm water. Some patina recipes will require the metal to be heated before applying the patina, so you may need to purchase a torch to heat the metal. Fill a container with your patina mixture. You can use a regular paint bucket for cold mixtures, but you may want to use a large metal pot if the patina mixture needs to be heated. The bucket should be large enough to immerse your object in the solution. Patina mixtures may need to be heated or cooled, so use a container that will work for the temperature of your recipe. Some chemicals can give off hazardous fumes. Always use a workspace that is well-ventilated. If you are coloring an object that is too large to put in a container, you can put a patina solution into a spray bottle and spray it all over the metal. You can also wet a rag with the solution and rub it on the metal, or use a paint brush to apply it to the surface. Just be sure to wear rubber gloves when using harsh chemicals to avoid contact. Soak the piece in the mixture. Put on a pair of rubber gloves and place the metal object in the container filled with a patina mixture. Depending on your patina recipe, you may need to let the piece sit for anywhere from a few minutes up to several hours. Set a timer and wait. Remove the metal. Check on your piece after the allotted time. If you want a more intense color, let the metal soak longer. Put on a pair of rubber gloves and remove the metal once your metal has taken on its desired appearance. Let the metal dry completely. The patina will continue to change while the piece dries, so be patient. If you want to color the piece further, place it back into the mixture and repeat the process. Coat the metal with a varnish. Use a spray-on acrylic clear coat varnish to help protect the surface and coloration. Coloring Metals with Heat Clean the metal. Remove all dust, dirt and fingerprints from the metal before beginning. Wash the metal with soap and water. Let the metal soak in a degreaser. Place it on a clean surface to dry. Do not handle the metal with your hands after cleaning. Even the grease from your fingers can impact the formation of the colors. Heat adds color to metals in a fairly unpredictable way that varies based on temperature, humidity, time, and the composition of the metal. Turn on a heat source. You can use this method on any metals containing copper or iron, such as steel. A smaller, focused flame, such as a Bunsen burner or torch, will provide a more dramatic variation of colors. An open flame will create more of a subtle variation. Depending on the temperature that the metal reaches you can create a color from pale yellow to blue. Use some tongs or a wrench or similar tool to grip the metal to avoid contacting the heated metal after exposing it to the flame. If you have an oven you can also heat the metal that way to provide a more even coloration. Expose the metal to the flame. There is not much you can do to control the pattern or formation of the coloration. You can only somewhat control the color by how long you heat the metal. You will notice that the piece doesn't remain the same color as it cools from the heat. For example, reds may cool to bluish purples. Be sure to heat metal only in a well-ventilated area. Use caution not to burn yourself. Wear some work gloves. If your flame is fine and your metal piece large enough, you can trace patterns onto your metal. Allow the metal to cool. Turn off the torch or heat source. Set the metal down somewhere safe, like a concrete floor, to cool. You may want to have a bucket of cold water on hand to dip the hot metal in and cool it quickly. Coat the metal with a varnish or wax. If you are working a piece of jewelry or art, you may want to apply a sealant to protect and give the metal a glossy finish. After the metal cools, apply a coat of beeswax or an acrylic clear coat to protect the colors and the surface. Allow the finish to dry.",

        "Anodizing Metal Understand the anodizing process.",
        "Anodizing converts the surface of a metal object into its oxide form.",
        "Anodized aluminum oxide is incredibly tough and resistant to corrosion.",
        "It is also porous compared to unoxidized aluminum, allowing it to absorb a variety of metal dyes.",
        "The conversion process uses an electric current and a strong acid bath.",
        "The metal being anodized is connected to a circuit and placed in the acid bath where it acts as an anode (positive electrode).",
        "Negative hydroxide ions within the bath are attracted to the positive anode where they react with aluminum to form aluminum oxide.",
        "A scrap of aluminum is also placed in the bath, connected to the other wire.",
        "This serves as the cathode (negative electrode), completing the circuit.",
        "Aluminum is the typical metal of choice for this method, but other non-ferrous (non-iron) metals like magnesium and titanium can also be anodized.",
        "Gather your materials.",
        "You will want to start by finding a space that you can work without causing any potential damage.",
        "You can gather these items individually, or you can purchase a commercial anodizing kit that should include everything you need.",
        "Select your metal.",
        "Any aluminum or aluminum alloy can be anodized.",
        "Other types of metal, like steel, won't work.",
        "You will need three plastic tubs.",

        "One will be used for the cleaning process, one for the acid, and one for the dye bath.",
        "Large, plastic paint buckets will work well for most jobs.",
        "Get a plastic jug to hold your neutralizing solution.",
        "For reagents, you will need sulfuric acid, baking soda, lye, metal fiber dye, and distilled water.",
