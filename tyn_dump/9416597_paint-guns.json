Use clean gloves to handle the clean parts as oils from your fingers will mar the surface and prevent the paint from adhering properly."

Use modeling clay or foam ear plugs to plug holes in parts like the barrel so paint won\u2019t pool inside them. Changing the Color Choose metal paint designed for use on guns. Some products, like DuraCoat, air dry to a set finish. Other products, like DuraBake, need to be baked to set the finish. You can bake small metal parts in a toaster oven. However, if you plan to keep the gun intact or if the parts are too large to fit in the toaster oven, be sure to choose paint that sets while air drying and doesn\u2019t need to be baked. Suspend the parts or gun in the air. Use wire, like a coat hanger, to hang the parts or gun so you can access them from 360 degrees. Put a plastic dropcloth over your work area and wear a respirator, safety glasses, and gloves. Spray the parts with the desired paint. You can buy finishing kits that come with aerosol spray cans, or use a paint sprayer powered by compressed air. Hold the can or sprayer 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) away from the surface and spray each part or the whole gun with smooth, back-and-forth motions until all areas are evenly covered. Let the paint dry, then apply a second coat, if desired. Use sponges dipped in paint to dab on different colors if you want to camouflage the gun. Remove the tape and clay or plugs once the paint has air dried. Refer to the instructions on the paint to find out how long it takes to dry. Generally, paint will be dry to the touch in 30 minutes to 2 hours. Carefully remove the masking tape and any modeling clay or foam ear plugs from the holes. Bake metal parts if required.
