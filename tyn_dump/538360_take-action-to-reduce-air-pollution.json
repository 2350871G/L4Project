Get familiar with your city or town's bus or train routes, and start replacing your car commute with a bus trip at least once a week. Work up to using public transportation as often as possible, only using your car when you can't figure out a good alternative. Taking a bus or train to work, school or any other activity has a lot of advantages. Aside from doing your part to reduce air pollution, you'll have extra time to read, knit, do crosswords, or people watch. Taking public transportation is also safer than driving, and will probably help reduce your anxiety level since you won't have to deal with rush hour traffic."

Take a look around your house and figure out items you could make instead of buying. Here are a few ideas:\nFood, of course! If you tend to buy a lot of pre-packaged food, then making your meals from scratch is a good place to start. Eliminating convenience foods and creating dishes with raw ingredients is healthier and better for the environment. For example, if you love spaghetti,  make your sauce from raw tomatoes and garlic rather than buying a can of pre-made sauce. You can make your own pasta, too! Did you know you can make your own household cleaners? Instead of buying  dish soap,  laundry detergent and  bathtub cleaner, make your own using nontoxic ingredients. Store your concoctions in glass jars. The same goes for homemade  shampoo, toothpaste, deodorant and lip balm. Clothing is a bit trickier to make on your own, but if you're feeling ambitious and want to give it a try, start with basics like shirts and pants. If you're interested in becoming a full-time maker, look into the  art of homesteading. Soon you'll be growing the tomatoes and garlic you need to make that sauce."

Here are a few more ideas for cutting back on the energy your household uses on a daily basis:\nTake advantage of natural light. Set up your work or study space near a window that gets bright light all day, so you won't have to switch the lights on.
