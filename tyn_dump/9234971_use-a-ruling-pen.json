India ink is a strong, black ink commonly used with ruling pens, but feel free to try other colors as you please. At home, you can dip the pen directly into the ink bottle or pour out the ink into a container. Oil paint also can be used with ruling pens. You\u2019ll need to mix the paint with mineral spirits and a medium such as linseed oil to make it more fluid first."
