    "text": " Slicing and Stuffing the Turkey Cut the turkey meat away from the bone if it's not boneless. Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut as much of the breast meat away from the bone as possible. Try to keep the meat in one long piece, rather than cutting it into smaller pieces. You can save the bones from the breast to make a gravy or soup later. Slice boneless turkey breasts horizontally to make 2 long pieces. On the thicker side of the breast, cut the meat in a horizontal line until you're about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the other side of the meat. Leave the two halves connected to form one long pieces of meat. Be careful not to cut the breast in half. If you do, it may be more difficult to get your roll to stay together. Place the turkey on a cutting board and cover the meat with plastic wrap. Situate your turkey breast so that it is laying flat on the cutting board. Then, tear a piece of plastic wrap large enough to cover the meat, and put it over the top of the meat. This will protect the meat and keep it from breaking apart when you're flattening it. Use a mallet to flatten the turkey to 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. Pound the turkey breast flat with a mallet, focusing on thicker areas. When the meat is flat, it should be and even thickness. You can make the meat as thin as \u20442 inch (1.3 cm), but flattening it any more than that can cause the turkey to tear when you roll it. If you don't have a mallet, you can use a rolling pin to press and flatten the meat. Lay bacon strips vertically on a piece of wax paper with the turkey on top. Line up 10-12 strips of bacon so that they are in an \u201cup and down\u201d position. Organize them so they overlap slightly on each side, and lay the flattened turkey breast on top of the bacon. If your turkey breast is much longer than the bacon, add additional strips to either end until the row of bacon is as long as the turkey. Spoon the stuffing horizontally across the center of the turkey in a log shape. Layer the package of prepared stuffing on top of the turkey in a line across the length of the breast. Use your hands or a spoon to form it into a log shape, with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of uncovered turkey above and below the stuffing. You can use any kind of stuffing that you prefer. If you're using a homemade stuffing mix, only prepare about 2 cups (470 mL) of the stuffing to prevent the roll from becoming too thick. Creating the Roll Roll the turkey up and around the stuffing. Using your hands, lift the bottom part of the turkey that isn't covered by stuffing, and fold it across the top of the stuffing log. Then, lift and fold the top half of the turkey across the stuffing to create the beginning of the roll. If you left enough free turkey above and below the stuffing log, these pieces should overlap and stay folded. Fold the bacon strips across the turkey roll. Working from left to right, fold the bottom and top parts of the bacon around the turkey breast. The ends of the bacon should overlap on the top of the turkey roll, wrapping the meat completely. For extra support, you can position a piece of bacon horizontally on either side of the turkey log before you begin to wrap the log. Season the roll with salt and pepper. Put a pinch of salt and pepper along the seam of the bacon to season the underside of the turkey roll. This is the portion of the log that will be facing down as the roll bakes. You can add other spices as desired to get a different taste, like sage or rosemary for a more festive turkey roll. Tie the roll closed with baker's twine. Slide a piece of baker's twine under the roll and position it under the center of the roll, tying it to hold the roll in place.
