Most deer repellents will also be effective since squirrels and deers are driven off by many of the same scents. Look specifically for a repellent with large amounts of \"putrescent whole egg solids.\" This is, essentially, rotten eggs. Squirrels typically hate the smell of rotten eggs. Be aware that many repellents can have a strong odor, especially immediately after application. The smell tends to dissipate as the spray dries, but in the meantime, you may need to place the pumpkin away from the house."

Cat hair may have a similar effect on squirrels, since larger cats can pose a threat to squirrels. It is best to use pet hair rather than pet waste. Cat waste is especially dangerous to use since it is a source of toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that can cause serious health concerns for pregnant women and people with immune deficiencies."

Blend the hottest peppers you can find with enough water to form a liquid. Add a drop of dish soap and a drop of vegetable oil to help the solution stick and pour it into a spray bottle. Coat the pumpkin every few days with this solution to drive squirrels away. Rub a coat of commercial hot sauce over all sides of the pumpkin. You may need to reapply the sauce after a few days or after the rain, but the hot oils have a way of penetrating the skin and soaking into the flesh of the pumpkin. Create a scent barrier around your pumpkin by sprinkling powdered cayenne pepper around it. You can also sprinkle the pepper on top of the pumpkin for added effect. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling hot peppers. Otherwise, you may irritate your skin or eyes."
