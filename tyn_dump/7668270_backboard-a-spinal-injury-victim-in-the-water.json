Have a secondary lifeguard bring you a backboard. Approach the victim. After activating the EAP, carefully slide into the water and walk towards the victim. Avoid making a large splash and making waves in the water. They could jostle the victim and hurt them more. Splint the victim's head and neck. Carefully raise the victim's arms above his/her head, bringing them to a point.

It could cause paralysis of the victim. You can change the method of stabilization, but do not break it. Placing The Backboard Place victim onto the backboard. While you are holding the victims arms against his/her head, have your secondary lifeguard approach you with the backboard. Instruct them to come up to the side of your body in which you are holding the victim. Have them tilt the backboard all the way on its side and swiftly dunk it straight down into the water.

Once both of the restraints are in place, use the head restraint strap attached to the head restraint portion of the board to completely immobilize the victim's head. Place the strap so that it lies across the victim's forehead. Secure the strap on the opposite side of the board. Removing The Victim From The Water Position the backboard so it is ready for removal from the water. After finishing securing the victim to the board, grab one side of the board as you move from behind the head of the board to standing next to it. With the help of your secondary guard, place the top edge of the board on the gutter of the pool. Position yourself so that you can remove the backboard and victim.
