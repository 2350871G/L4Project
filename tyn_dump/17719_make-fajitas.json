Pour \u20444 cup (59 ml) of olive oil into a large bowl along with \u20444 cup (59 ml) of orange juice and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lime juice. Stir in 1 tablespoon (8 g) of minced garlic, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of cumin, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of chili powder, 1 teaspoon (2.5 g) of oregano, 1 teaspoon (2.5 g) of smoked paprika, \u00bc cup (5 g) of chopped cilantro, and 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of flank or skirt steak. Cover and refrigerate the meat for at least 2 hours. Ensure that the steak is coated with the marinade and then cover the bowl. Refrigerate the steak for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours. The meat will become tender and flavorful as it marinates. Remove and pat the meat dry with paper towels. When you're ready to cook the steak, take the bowl out of the refrigerator. Remove the meat and set it on a cutting board. Pat both sides of the steak dry using paper towels. Then sprinkle both sides of the meat with coarse sea salt and black pepper. The salt will also make the meat more tender. Cook the steak for 6 to 10 minutes over medium-high heat. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil into a large skillet and turn the burner to medium-high heat. Once the oil shimmers, lay the steak in the skillet. Cook the meat for 6 to 10 minutes and turn it half way through the cooking time. Cook the steak until it reaches at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) with an instant-read meat thermometer. Remove and rest the steak for 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the burner and move the steak to a clean cutting board. Cover it loosely with aluminum foil and let the steak rest for 3 to 5 minutes. The steak will continue to cook as it rests. Slice the steak into 1/2 in (1.3 cm) strips. Uncover the steak and use a sharp knife to slice the steak. Cut against the grain to get the most tender steak and make your slices thin. Chicken Mix the salt, cornstarch, pepper, garlic, cumin, and chili powder. Get out a small bowl and put in \u00bd tablespoon (8.5 g) of salt. Stir in 1 tablespoon (8 g) of cornstarch, \u00bc teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground black pepper, \u00bc teaspoon of (0.5 g) of garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon (0.3 g) of cumin, and \u00bc teaspoon (0.5 g) of ancho chili powder. Cook the chicken strips over medium-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil into a skillet and turn the burner to medium-high. Once the oil shimmers, place 1 pound (450 g) of sliced chicken breasts into the skillet. Cook the chicken until it's browned and reaches 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C) with an instant-read meat thermometer. Stir the chicken frequently as it cooks to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Stir in the seasoning, water, and lime juice. Add the seasoning mixture to the chicken and pour in \u20444 cup (180 ml) of water and the juice of 1 lime. Stir until the chicken is coated with the seasoning. Simmer the chicken for 3 minutes. Turn the burner down to low so the liquid begins to bubble gently. Simmer the chicken for 3 minutes and stir it occasionally. Some of the liquid will evaporate as the chicken cooks. Shrimp Thread 2 to 3 pounds (0.9 to 1.3 kg) of shrimp onto short skewers. Get out a package of skewers that are about 6 in (15 cm) long. Thread 4 to 5 shrimp onto each skewer. If you prefer, leave the shrimp separate and just cook them loose in the pan. The skewers make it easier to remove the shrimp from the marinade. Put the shrimp, sauce, seasoning, garlic, cilantro, and juice into a bag. Open a large sealable freezer bag and put \u20444 cup (180 ml) of red enchilada sauce into it. Add 2 tablespoons (5 g) of taco seasoning mix, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 handful of snipped fresh cilantro, and the juice of 1 lemon. Put the shrimp skewers in the bag and seal it shut. If you don't have a sealable plastic bag, mix the marinade in a long dish and lay the skewers in it. Refrigerate the shrimp for 15 to 30 minutes. Ensure that the shrimp are coated in both sides with the marinade. Put the bag in the refrigerator and chill it for 15 to 30 minutes. The shrimp will absorb the flavors as it marinates. Cook the shrimp over medium heat for 6 minutes. Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into a large skillet or griddle pan and turn the burner to medium. Once the oil shimmers, remove the shrimp from the refrigerator and take the skewers out of the bag. Lay the shrimp in the skillet and cook them for 3 minutes. Use tongs to turn the shrimp and cook them for 3 more minutes. The shrimp will become opaque and white once it's finished cooking. Avoid overcooking the shrimp or the texture will become rubbery. Cooking the Onions and Peppers Slice 2 onions, 1 poblano, and 3 bell peppers. Rinse the produce and use a large knife to slice the 2 onions into 1/2 in (1.3 cm) strips. Push them to the side of your cutting board and then trim the stems off of 3 bell peppers and 1 poblano. Rinse away the seeds and slice the peppers into 1/2 in (1.3 cm) strips. Use any color of bell pepper you like or use a mix of colors. Heat the oil and add the vegetable strips to the skillet. Pour 1 \u20442 tablespoons (22 ml) of vegetable oil into a skillet and turn the burner to medium. Once the oil heats and begins to shimmer, put the sliced onions, poblano, and bell peppers in the skillet. Add salt and cook the vegetables for 7 to 8 minutes. Add 1 generous pinch of salt and stir the vegetables occasionally as they cook. Cook the vegetables until the onions become clear and the peppers soften. Stirring frequently will prevent the vegetables from sticking to the skillet. Serving the Fajitas Place your choice of meat across the center of a tortilla. Get out flour or corn tortillas and place several pieces of shrimp, steak, or chicken in a line down the center of a tortilla. If you like, you can even combine the meats. If you like, warm the tortillas before filling them. For a low-carb fajita, substitute large lettuce leaves for the tortillas and fill them with the meat of your choice. Cover the meat with peppers and onions. Spread enough cooked peppers and onions over the meat to cover it. If you prefer, place even more meat on top of the peppers and onions. Serve the fajita with your favorite toppings. Offer your guests a variety of seasonings and sauces to eat with the fajitas. For example, set out:\nGuacamole\nSour cream\nChopped cilantro\nSalsa Store the leftover fajita components for up to 3 to 5 days. Put the leftover onions, peppers, and meat or shrimp in an airtight container. It's fine to put them all in the same container. Store the leftovers in the refrigerator and use them within 3 to 5 days. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for storing leftover tortillas. Some might call for storing them at room temperature while other brands recommend refrigerating them.",
