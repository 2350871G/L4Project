            "description": "When left exposed to air (either indoors or outdoors), wrought iron will rust readily. If there is any rust present on your piece, you should remove it instead of painting over it. This is best done with a stiff wire brush, although it can be done more efficiently with a sandblaster if you have the required space to use one. Scrub the entire piece with the brush until all visible rust is gone. You may want to do this in a garage where you can easily sweep up the metal and paint flakes afterwards. If the wrought iron is already painted, you will get the best results if you scrub away the old coat of paint with the wire brush."

            "description": "After sanding the piece smooth, you need to apply a coat of primer. This will help prevent the formation of rust and make your paint color appear as it should. Rust inhibiting primer is a product specifically designed for use on metals containing iron, and it can be purchased at any hardware store. It is best applied with a brush in a single thin coat."

Using ordinary exterior paint will lead to chipping. The paint should be applied with a brush in long, smooth strokes. A second coat can be applied if desired."
