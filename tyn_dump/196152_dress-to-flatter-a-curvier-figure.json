    "text": " Tips on Tops Opt for form-fitting tops over loose tops.  Consider a top with an empire waist. The empire waist nips in at the smallest part of your waist, naturally emphasizing your curves. Look for belted tops. Thick belts are another way to draw attention to your narrow waist, and some tops come with a belt included in the design. Add a belt to a non-belted top. Buy a basic top, such as a tube top, knit top, or long-sleeve blouse. Look for fitted cuts. Tie a thick belt or sash around the top at your natural waist. Consider a wrap-style top. Wrap tops also nip in at the waist, showing off your curves. Only wear fitted dress shirts, and avoid boxy styles. Look for shirts that have darted waists. Try a shirt that adds volume to your bust and shoulders, such as a snug empire waist or flowing blouse with a band at the waist. Always opt for a shirt that nips in at the waist, even for looser designs like these. Make sure you pair voluminous tops with bottoms that also add volume to keep your curves in proportion. Tips on Jackets Look for form-fitting jackets that nip in at the waist and flare out at the hips.  Select a length that works for your height. Shorter women should look for shorter jackets, while taller women can consider longer jackets. Stick with single breasted jackets, since double breasted jackets may end up adding unwanted bulk that can throw off your curves.  Avoid jackets with too many pockets or additional detailing that could add bulk to your curves or waist.  Tips on Pants Look for pants with wide waistbands that further emphasize the waist.  Choose a pair of straight-leg pants to wear with a form-fitting top.  Opt for cargo pants with side pockets to keep the balance of your curves when you wear a fuller top.  Stick with boot-cut jeans for the most versatility. Select a boot-cut with a slightly more noticeable flare to help balance out your curvy hips. Avoid pants with belts, pockets, or other detailing around the hips or rear. These details will just add bulk, throwing off the balance of your curves. Consider dark wash jeans that keep you looking slim.  Tips on Skirts Gravitate toward curve-hugging pencil skirts or other cuts that skim your figure. High-waisted skirts work especially well. Look for a curve-hugging skirt that flares or flounces out around the bottom if you plan on wearing it with a fuller top.  Pair full skirts, like A-lines, with a full top that adds volume to your shoulders and bust. Full skirts add slight volume to your hips, balancing out a fuller top. Tips on Dresses Look for snug fits that emphasize your waist and keep your top and bottom curves balanced.  Consider a bodice dress that naturally keeps the top and bottom sections looking separate.

Look for form-fitting dresses with a diagonal or bias cut to show off your legs and add a bit of visual interest to your style. Make sure you choose one that comes in at the waist, hugs the hips, and falls over your thighs loosely. Look at Necklines Try a scooped or boat-neck neckline that hangs low and accentuates your curvy bust.  Wear V-neck tops, since these also draw attention to your bust.
