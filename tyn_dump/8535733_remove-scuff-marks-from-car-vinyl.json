If you don\u2019t want to purchase a specially made degreaser or scuff remover, you can try making a homemade cleaner first. Combine equal parts of white vinegar and water.

You can find degreasers for car interiors at your local automotive or home improvement store. Since it\u2019s a concentrated product, you\u2019ll have to dilute the degreaser when you\u2019re ready to use it. Dilute your degreaser in four parts of water. If you\u2019re using a store-bought degreaser, you\u2019ll need to dilute it before using it on your car vinyl. Mix one part degreaser with four parts of water. Then pour your solution into a clean spray bottle. Spray the scuffed surface and scrub. Spray your diluted degreaser or homemade cleaner directly onto the scuffed vinyl.
