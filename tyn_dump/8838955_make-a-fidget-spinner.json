Get a toothpick and push it through the middle of the spinner base, so that the base is around halfway up the toothpick. Move it back and forth to get rid of any loose edges around the hole. You can find the exact center of a 2-prong spinner by measuring the length and width and dividing each by 2. On a spinner with an uneven number of prongs or an irregular shape, draw a straight line through each prong towards the center. The area where they meet is the middle.
