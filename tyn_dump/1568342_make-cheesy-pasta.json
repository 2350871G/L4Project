You might want to add in 1 to 2 teaspoons of some sort of cooking oil. This will help keep the pasta from sticking. Cook the pasta until it is al dente. Most packages will tell you how long this will take. It can be as little as 8 minutes, to as long as 12. Drain the pasta when it is done cooking. Take the pot off the stove, and carry it over the sink. Pour the water and pasta through a colander or strainer. Run the pasta under cold water, then set it aside. Once you have drained the pasta, keep it in the strainer, and run it under cold water for a few seconds. This will stop the pasta from cooking and turning mushy. Give the strainer a jiggle to get rid of any excess water, then set the pasta aside. Preparing the Sauce Heat 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk in a saucepan over medium heat. You will be adding the rest of the milk later. Mix \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of milk with 2 tablespoons of flour. In a separate cup, whisk together the remaining milk with the flour. Keep whisking until there are no clumps left. When the milk starts to steam, mix in the flour-milk. Wait until the heating milk starts to form tendrils of steam. When it does, pour in the flour-milk, and stir it with a whisk. Keep whisking until the milk starts to thicken. You are looking for a heavy, cream-like consistency.

Keep stirring until the cheese melts and the sauce is smooth and creamy. At this point, you can give your sauce a taste, and make any adjustments, if needed. Take the sauce off the heat. You are now ready to mix it into your pasta. Putting Everything Together Put the pasta into a large serving bowl. Choose a bowl that is a little bit larger than you think it needs to be. This will make mixing the pasta and sauce a lot easier. It will help prevent any bits of pasta from escaping. Add in half of the cheese sauce. You will be adding the rest of the sauce later. It is easier to mix in small amounts of sauce at a time. Stir the two together until the pasta is evenly coated. Use a large spoon or spatula.
