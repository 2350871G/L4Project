Take some time to find a perfume that you like so you can smell nice too. Don't apply too much at once - you don't want it to be overpowering.

You don't have to have pale skin to act like Bella, but if you do want to have pale skin, there are a few different ways to do so. Use sunscreen with a high SPF. When you're outside, especially in the summer, use sunscreen with a high SPF (45 or higher) to keep your skin pale. Avoid tanning or lying in the sun for a long time. Use a foundation that isn't any darker than your natural skin-tone\nOne night a week, take a bath with 2 cups of milk in it. Then put 1/3 cups of baking soda in the bath. Bathe for 30 minutes - 1 hour. It will make your skin paler. Use skin lightening cream."
