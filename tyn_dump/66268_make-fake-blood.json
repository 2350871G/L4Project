Keep in mind that you may need to add extra red food coloring, since it will be diluted. If you don't want to use corn syrup, you could substitute golden syrup. Creating Edible Fake Blood with Powdered Sugar Measure water and powdered sugar into a blender. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of water into a blender or food processor. Measure out 3 1/2 cups (16 ounces or 453 g) of powdered sugar and add it to the blender. Blitz the water and powdered sugar. Put the lid on the blender and blend the water and powdered sugar for about 30 seconds. The powdered sugar should completely dissolve in the water. You may need to pulse the mixture to break up any clumps of powdered sugar. Add red food coloring and cocoa to the blender. Pour 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of red food coloring into the blender. Put the lid on it and pulse the blender until the dye is blended into the mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder and blitz the fake blood again. The cocoa will help the fake blood thicken a little and will make it turn a more realistic shade of red. Adjust the color of the fake blood.

Add more red food coloring or cocoa powder to get the color you want. You can transfer the fake blood to a squeeze bottle and squirt it when you're ready to use it. Just store it in the refrigerator until you need it. Creating Edible Fake Blood with Flour Place the water and flour into a sauce pot. Get out a small sauce pot and pour 1 cup (240 ml) of water into it. Add 1 tablespoon of flour into the water and whisk the mixture to break up any lumps. Try to dissolve the flour in the water. If you don't have a whisk, you can use a fork to quickly combine the water and flour. Heat the mixture. Turn the heat on to high until it begins to boil. One it's bubbling, turn the heat down to medium-low. It should only bubble a little. Simmer the mixture for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it cool. Cooking the flour and water mixture will make your fake blood thick. Stir in the red food coloring. Pour 2 tablespoons of red food coloring into the cooled flour and water mixture. Whisk or stir the red food coloring until the color is completely mixed into the thick mixture. You can add more red food coloring for a brighter shade of fake blood.",
