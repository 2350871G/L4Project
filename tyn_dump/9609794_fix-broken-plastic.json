        "The more surface area it has, the faster the acetone will act on it.",
        "The slurry should have a smooth, creamy consistency and be free of lumps or chunks before you attempt to use it to weld other pieces together.",
        "Once the heavier plastic has dissolved entirely, it will separate from the acetone and sink to the bottom of the container.",
        "Do not dispose of the excess acetone in a sink or toilet bowl, it must be taken to a hazardous chemical disposal site.",
        "Put the excess acetone in a glass jar with a tightly sealing cap and dispose of it at an approved hazardous chemical disposal site.",
        "Drain the liquid into a glass jar so that only the plastic slurry remains.",
        "You\u2019ll use this as a filler to make your repairs.",
        "It\u2019s okay if there are traces amounts of acetone left in the container.",
        "It will quickly evaporate on its own.",
        "Brush the slurry into the damaged area.",
        "Dip a thin paintbrush or cotton swab into the liquefied plastic and dab it into the space between the two broken pieces.",
        "Try to work it as deep into the joint as possible.",
        "Continue dipping and brushing until you\u2019ve filled in all cracks and gaps.",
        "If possible, apply the slurry to the back or underside of the piece so it won\u2019t be as noticeable.",
        "Use as much of the plastic as you need to successfully seal up the damaged area (you\u2019ll probably end up with quite a bit left over).",
        "Give the plastic time to harden.",
        "Within minutes, the last traces of acetone will vaporize and the slurry will form a chemical bond with the surrounding plastic.",
        "Avoid disturbing the conjoined pieces in the meantime.",
        "Once the new plastic has had time to solidify, the item will be almost as good as new.",
        "The new joint will be about 95% as strong as the original plastic."
