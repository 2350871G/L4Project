Place your hands in the bowl or basin so that your glue-on nails are completely submerged in the water, and keep them there for about 15 minutes. The soap and water will soak into the nail glue and soften it, making it easier to remove the nails. You can also soak your nails in a little pure acetone to soften the glue, but be aware that acetone is much harsher on your skin, nails and cuticles than soap and water. Alternatively, soften up your nail glue by putting a few drops of cuticle oil on each false nail and letting it soak in for a few seconds."
