One ball will make up the actual smoke bomb, while the others will be cut up and placed inside of the first ping-pong ball to add more smoke when you set it off. Choose balls that are the same color, because the color you choose will end up being the color of the smoke. It\u2019s important that you use celluloid ping-pong balls instead of plastic ones. You can tell the difference between the two because the plastic balls are shiny and bend easily. The celluloid ping-pong balls are typically more durable and matte."

You can tell the difference between the two because the plastic balls are shiny and bend easily. The celluloid ping-pong balls are typically more durable and matte. Pierce a hole in one of the balls using a knife or screwdriver. Take one of your ping-pong balls and poke a hole in it. To do this, firmly hold the ball between your thumb and index finger on a flat surface. Take a small screwdriver or knife and apply pressure until it pokes through. The hole will be used to fit the other ping-pong balls. Cut the remaining ping-pong balls into small pieces and put them in the hole of the first ball. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut the remaining ping-pong balls into small pieces. You may need to pierce the balls with a knife or screwdriver first in order to make a starting point for cutting. The pieces should be small enough to fit into the hole of the first ping-pong ball. Fill the ball with the pieces until it is completely full.

Grab the pencil by the eraser and carefully pull it out of the foil. When you take it out, make sure the shape of the foil stays intact. This shape will leave a chimney for the smoke to travel up through the aluminum foil when you light the smoke bomb. Take the smoke bomb outside in an open area. Smoke bombs should never be used indoors due to the risk of fire and smoke inhalation. Nitrocellulose, the chemical inside of ping-pong balls, is mildly toxic when inhaled. Take your finished smoke bomb outdoors and put it in the grass in an open area away from other people and pets. Light a flame underneath the foil-wrapped ping-pong ball. Hold the smoke bomb at the top, and then use a lighter to light a flame right under the ping-pong ball. The smoke will start to pour out of the hole in the ball and out through the chimney left by the pencil. Toss the bomb and watch it smoke. Once it starts to smoke, toss or place the smoke bomb on the ground and quickly move away from it. Stand a few feet back to avoid breathing in the toxic smoke. If you start to smell something funny, stand back a little farther. Using Potassium Nitrate and Sugar Gather your supplies and put on your safety gear.

Contact with potassium nitrate can cause eye and skin irritation. Breathing it in can irritate your nose and cause sneezing and coughing. Cover one end of the toilet paper tube with duct tape. Before you make your potassium nitrate mixture, you\u2019ll need to prepare your cardboard tube. Put 2 pieces of tape on top of the hole so it\u2019s completely covered. Then secure those two pieces with a longer tape strip around the base. This will ensure that the smoke bomb mixture won\u2019t leak out when you pour it in the tube. Combine potassium nitrate and white sugar in a cast iron skillet. Measure out 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of potassium nitrate and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of sugar. Pour it in your cast iron skillet and mix it together with a spoon until they are completely combined. Heat the pan on the stove over medium-low heat for 15 minutes.

Move away quickly as soon as the fuse is lit to avoid smoke inhalation or injury. Your smoke bomb will produce a large cloud of dark smoke. Making Newspaper Smoke Bombs Open up an instant cold pack containing ammonium nitrate. You can purchase a cold pack at any drugstore. They contain ammonium nitrate, which is a common ingredient used in garden fertilizers. Similar to potassium nitrate, it can be combined with other ingredients to create explosives. Open the pack by cutting it with a pair of scissors, and remove the small water bag inside and discard it. Pour all of the potassium nitrate granules into a bucket. Once the cold pack is opened and you remove the water packet, pour all of the potassium nitrates into a large pan or bucket. Wear gloves when you handle the granules. Ammonium nitrate is not incredibly toxic, but if it gets on your skin, wipe it off, and rinse the skin immediately. Always wash your hands thoroughly with liquid soap when you are finished. Add water a little at a time until the granules are completely dissolved. You can add water from the sink or a hose. Make sure you add just a little at a time, and gently swirl the bucket until the ammonium nitrate dissolves. Stop adding water as soon as you notice all of the granules have dissolved so the solution is still concentrated. If you add too much water, you\u2019ll end up with bombs that don\u2019t smoke. Grab 10 individual sheets of old newspaper and fold them into squares. Fold the newspaper in half lengthwise, then fold it again by bringing the top down to the bottom. This will help the newspaper to fit in the bucket and make it easier to handle. Try to find an older newspaper. Brand new newspapers have a waxy film that prevents them from lighting properly. Dip each newspaper sheet one at a time into the ammonium nitrate solution. Put each newspaper one-by-one one into the solution, and then swish them around until they are completely soaked. Submerge each one in the liquid for at least 30 seconds. The wet newspaper will be fragile, so be careful not to rip it while handling. Unfold the newspaper sheets and lay them out in the sun to dry. You can use a driveway or any other concrete surface to dry your newspapers. Make sure you lay them out flat in a sunny spot so they can dry completely and evenly. If you are in a windy area, lay the newspaper sheets out and put rocks or other weights on the corners of each sheet to prevent them from flying away.

        "Cut the remaining ping-pong balls into small pieces and put them in the hole of the first ball.",
        "Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut the remaining ping-pong balls into small pieces.",
        "You may need to pierce the balls with a knife or screwdriver first in order to make a starting point for cutting.",
        "The pieces should be small enough to fit into the hole of the first ping-pong ball.",
        "Fill the ball with the pieces until it is completely full.",
        "Stick the sharp end of the pencil in the hole and wrap foil around it.",
        "Get your pencil and stick the sharpened side inside the hole of the ping-pong ball you just created.",
        "It may not fit all the way in because you just filled the hole, so just make sure the tip of the pencil is touching the outside of the ball.",
        "Then, get a piece of foil that is at least 6 by 6 inches (15 by 15 cm).",
        "Put the ping-pong ball in the center of the foil square, and wrap the foil tightly around the ball and pencil until it takes its shape.",
        "The only purpose of the pencil in this step is to create a mold for the foil, so do not completely cover it.",
        "Make sure there is a hole in the foil at the end of the pencil so you can take it out when you\u2019re finished.",
        "Take the pencil out of the foil wrap.",
        "Grab the pencil by the eraser and carefully pull it out of the foil.",
        "When you take it out, make sure the shape of the foil stays intact.",
        "This shape will leave a chimney for the smoke to travel up through the aluminum foil when you light the smoke bomb.",
        "Take the smoke bomb outside in an open area.",
        "Smoke bombs should never be used indoors due to the risk of fire and smoke inhalation.",
        "Nitrocellulose, the chemical inside of ping-pong balls, is mildly toxic when inhaled.",
        "Take your finished smoke bomb outdoors and put it in the grass in an open area away from other people and pets.",
        "Light a flame underneath the foil-wrapped ping-pong ball.",
        "Hold the smoke bomb at the top, and then use a lighter to light a flame right under the ping-pong ball.",
        "The smoke will start to pour out of the hole in the ball and out through the chimney left by the pencil.",
        "Toss the bomb and watch it smoke.",
        "Once it starts to smoke, toss or place the smoke bomb on the ground and quickly move away from it.",
        "Stand a few feet back to avoid breathing in the toxic smoke.",
        "If you start to smell something funny, stand back a little farther.",
        "Using Potassium Nitrate and Sugar Gather your supplies and put on your safety gear.",
        "Smoke bombs can be made with a simple concoction of potassium nitrate and sugar.",
        "By mixing these ingredients and melting them together, you create a flammable product that produces whirls of smoke when you light it on fire.",
        "You\u2019ll also need a cast iron skillet and some baking soda.",
        "Adding 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of baking soda will make the smoke burn a little bit longer.",
        "For safety gear, get a pair of latex gloves, goggles, and a filter mask to protect yourself from the smoke.",
        "Use an old cast iron skillet that you don\u2019t plan on cooking with in the future.",
        "The potassium nitrate mixture may ruin it.",
        "You can get potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter, at your local garden store or online.",
        "It\u2019s important to wear your safety gear.",
        "Contact with potassium nitrate can cause eye and skin irritation.",
        "Breathing it in can irritate your nose and cause sneezing and coughing.",
        "Cover one end of the toilet paper tube with duct tape.",
        "Before you make your potassium nitrate mixture, you\u2019ll need to prepare your cardboard tube.",
        "Put 2 pieces of tape on top of the hole so it\u2019s completely covered.",
        "Then secure those two pieces with a longer tape strip around the base.",
        "This will ensure that the smoke bomb mixture won\u2019t leak out when you pour it in the tube.",
        "Combine potassium nitrate and white sugar in a cast iron skillet.",
        "Measure out 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of potassium nitrate and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of sugar.",
        "Pour it in your cast iron skillet and mix it together with a spoon until they are completely combined.",
        "Heat the pan on the stove over medium-low heat for 15 minutes.",
        "While the mixture is heating up, stir it constantly until it\u2019s completely melted.",
        "As the sugar caramelizes, it should take on a brown or black color and form a thick, gooey texture like melted caramel.",
        "Do not overcook the mixture and take care not to set it on fire.",
        "If it starts to smoke in the pan, turn the heat down immediately.",
        "Add one spoonful of baking soda if you want the bomb to burn slowly.",
        "This step is optional, but you can add a spoonful of baking soda before you take it off the heat.",
        "The baking soda will moderate the reaction, making the smoke bomb burn a little bit slower.",
        "Pour the mixture into the cardboard tube.",
        "Turn off the heat on the stove and use a spoon to get as much of the mixture as you can into the tube.",
        "Work quickly because the mixture is going to harden.",
        "To make it easier to pour, you can use a funnel.",
        "Or you can place the mixture in a small plastic bag, cut off one corner, and squeeze it into the tube.",
        "When you\u2019re pouring the mixture in the cardboard tube, make sure to pack it tightly.",
        "If it\u2019s not, the smoke won\u2019t burn smoothly when you light the smoke bomb.",
        "Insert a visco fuse into the tube while the mixture is still soft.",
        "Visco is a type of fuse typically used for consumer fireworks.",
        "Cut at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the fuse and then stick one end into the middle of the tube through the mixture.",
        "Make sure at least 1 in (2.5 cm) of the fuse is sticking out of the mixture so you have enough room to light it.",
        "Let the mixture cool and harden.",
        "Let your mixture sit in a well-ventilated area so that it can cool down.",
        "It might take an hour or so to completely solidify.",
        "Place the bomb outside in an open area.",
        "Put your finished smoke bomb in an outdoor area clear of buildings, trees, other people, and pets.",
        "You should never light a smoke bomb indoors.",
        "Potassium nitrate smoke bombs burn very violently.",
        "So make sure you place it in a clear, open area away from anything that can catch fire.",
        "Light the fuse and enjoy your smoke bomb.",
        "Use a lighter to light the end of the fuse.",
        "Move away quickly as soon as the fuse is lit to avoid smoke inhalation or injury.",
        "Your smoke bomb will produce a large cloud of dark smoke.",
        "Making Newspaper Smoke Bombs Open up an instant cold pack containing ammonium nitrate.",
        "You can purchase a cold pack at any drugstore.",
        "They contain ammonium nitrate, which is a common ingredient used in garden fertilizers.",
        "Similar to potassium nitrate, it can be combined with other ingredients to create explosives.",
        "Open the pack by cutting it with a pair of scissors, and remove the small water bag inside and discard it.",
        "Pour all of the potassium nitrate granules into a bucket.",
        "Once the cold pack is opened and you remove the water packet, pour all of the potassium nitrates into a large pan or bucket.",
        "Wear gloves when you handle the granules.",
        "Ammonium nitrate is not incredibly toxic, but if it gets on your skin, wipe it off, and rinse the skin immediately.",
        "Always wash your hands thoroughly with liquid soap when you are finished.",
        "Add water a little at a time until the granules are completely dissolved.",
        "You can add water from the sink or a hose.",
        "Make sure you add just a little at a time, and gently swirl the bucket until the ammonium nitrate dissolves.",
        "Stop adding water as soon as you notice all of the granules have dissolved so the solution is still concentrated.",
        "If you add too much water, you\u2019ll end up with bombs that don\u2019t smoke.",
        "Grab 10 individual sheets of old newspaper and fold them into squares.",
        "Fold the newspaper in half lengthwise, then fold it again by bringing the top down to the bottom.",
        "This will help the newspaper to fit in the bucket and make it easier to handle.",
        "Try to find an older newspaper.",
        "Brand new newspapers have a waxy film that prevents them from lighting properly.",
        "Dip each newspaper sheet one at a time into the ammonium nitrate solution.",
        "Put each newspaper one-by-one one into the solution, and then swish them around until they are completely soaked.",
        "Submerge each one in the liquid for at least 30 seconds.",
        "The wet newspaper will be fragile, so be careful not to rip it while handling.",
        "Unfold the newspaper sheets and lay them out in the sun to dry.",
        "You can use a driveway or any other concrete surface to dry your newspapers.",
        "Make sure you lay them out flat in a sunny spot so they can dry completely and evenly.",
        "If you are in a windy area, lay the newspaper sheets out and put rocks or other weights on the corners of each sheet to prevent them from flying away.",
        "You can tell when they are ready when they can be lifted off of the pavement easily.",
        "Gather your dried newspapers and roll them all together.",
        "Once your newspapers are completely dry, put them all together in a stack.",
        "Then, starting from one end, roll them up.",
        "Secure the rolled newspaper by tying a string around them.",
        "Be careful not tie them too tight or too loose that they come apart.",
        "You may opt to experiment with different lengths and widths for your smoke bomb.",
        "If so, cut up the newspaper sheets, rip them in half, or leave them whole before rolling them up.",
        "Take your smoke bomb outside and light one end with a lighter.",
        "Now your smoke bomb is ready!",
        "Take it outside in an open area, and then use a lighter to light one end of the newspapers.",
        "You will notice clouds of smoke coming out of both ends of the newspaper."
