Typically, they are added to apple pies and they can also be added to other fruit pies that need a warm, spicy flavour. Relishes, chutneys, and pickles. Cloves make a spicy addition to many of these condiments. Poke them into a ham. Add crushed or ground cloves to cakes and desserts requiring a warm, spicy flavour. Use cloves in Indian cuisine. Cloves are a popular addition to many curry dishes and to biryani. Make coffee figs with cloves.
