Making an Extra-Poofy Ponytail Start with tangle-free hair. Even though you will be creating a voluminous ponytail, you still want it to look neat. Brush or comb through your hair to get rid of any knots or tangles. Gather your hair into a half-up, half-down bun. Begin making a half-up, half-down ponytail, at ear-level and up. Instead of wrapping a hair tie around it, twist it into a loose bun and secure it with a clip. Don't worry about making the bun perfect; you'll come back to it. Keep the horizontal part neat and clean. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb if you have to. Create a ponytail just below half-up, half-down bun. Gather all of the loose hair from the bottom layer. Pull it into a mid-high ponytail, as close to the horizontal part as you can. Secure the ponytail with a hair tie. Use a hair tie that matches your hair color, if possible. Split the ponytail in half horizontally. You can do this with your finger or with the handle of a rat-tail comb. Pull the upper layer away to reveal the bottom. Clamp a mini claw clip over the bottom layer. Open the claw clip up and clamp it over the lower layer of your split ponytail. Try to get it as close to your head as possible. You want the teeth part pointing down, and the handle part pointing up. For best results, use a claw clip that is close to your hair color and about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) long. This method works best if your hair is past shoulder-length. Let go of the top part of your ponytail. Allow the hair to fall naturally over the claw clip. Adjust it as needed to further hide the claw clip from view. Don't worry if a tiny bit peeks out, however; you still have the hair that's up in the bun! Undo the half-up, half-down bun and tease it. Undo the bun first, then gather hair at the top of your head. It should span from about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) behind your front hairline to the back of your crown, and eyebrow to eyebrow. Tease the hair a few sections as a time. You will have loose hair at your front and side hairlines. Do not tease this hair. Gather all of the loose hair and add it to the ponytail. Add all of the teased hair into the ponytail first. Next, smooth the un-teased hair at your hairline into the ponytail to hide the teasing. Secure everything with a hair tie.
