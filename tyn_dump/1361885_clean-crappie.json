Continue cutting until you reach the backbone, but be careful not to sever it. It\u2019s important to keep the backbone intact, as you\u2019ll use it as a guide when cutting. Carving along the backbone will enable you to fillet the fish without the need to first remove the head or tail."

If you do this correctly, there will be no need to make any other clumsy cuts. The first cut is intended to open up the fish and create an entry point that you can then use to strip the fillet.

Rather than attempting to saw through the skin, simply push the blade and let the meat come free. Stop when you reach the rear section of the fish near the tail. If you\u2019re cutting close enough to the backbone, you should be able to feel the contours of each individual rib as you push the knife through. Holding the loose flap with your opposite hand while you cut can give you a little extra leverage and stability."
