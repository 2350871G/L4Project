Next, compare your dog\u2019s stats to a general measuring guide for collar fitting. Note that many retailers sell collars based on general weight classes. Extra-extra-small and extra-small dogs weigh up to 10 pounds (4.5 kg), and need collars that are about 6 to 12 in (15 to 30 cm) long. Pomeranians, Yorkshire Terriers, Dachshunds, Chihuahuas, and Toy Poodles fit into this category. Small dogs weigh between 11 and 25 pounds (5.0 and 11.3 kg), and need collars that are between 10 and 14 in (25 and 36 cm) long. Miniature Schnauzers, Corgis, Shiba Inus, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel qualify for this group. Medium dogs weigh between 26 and 55 pounds (12 and 25 kg), and require collars that are between 14 to 20 in (36 to 51 cm) long. Springer Spaniels, English Bulldogs, and some Pit Bulls fall into this group. Large dogs weigh between 56 and 75 pounds (25 and 34 kg), and need a collar that\u2019s between 16 to 26 in (41 to 66 cm) long. Most Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers are in this category. Extra-large and extra-extra-large dogs weigh over 76 pounds (34 kg), and need a collar that\u2019s between 24 to 30 in (61 to 76 cm) long. Saint Bernards, Great Danes, and Bullmastiffs qualify for this category."
