Lightly push on the top of their shells to make sure there aren\u2019t any areas that feel soft to the touch. If you find crabs that have broken or soft shells, either put them back in the water or throw them away. Crabs with damaged or soft shells usually do not survive transport since they are weaker than the other crabs. Don\u2019t transport crabs that are already dead since they can contaminate the other crabs they\u2019re packed with."

Wear rubber gloves while you\u2019re cutting between the crabs\u2019 claws since they may try to pinch you.Tip: If you have trouble getting the blade between the pincers, use a wedge-shaped piece of metal, also known as a nicking bar, to pry and hold them open."
