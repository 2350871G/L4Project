                    "description": "Set the tire on a flat surface and locate the air valve. It will be a small metal or rubber spoke sticking out from the tire. Twist the cap counterclockwise to remove it. The core is a metal cylinder inside the valve, and to remove it, you need a valve core removal tool. Stick the end of the tool inside the valve, then twist it counterclockwise to remove the core. The core holds in air, so removing it deflates the tire. The valve core removal tool is a relatively inexpensive item that looks like a small screwdriver. It's available at most auto parts stores."

                    "description": "The bead is the braided edge of the tire that fits firmly against the rim. The simplest way to remove it without extra tools is to set it on the ground in front of a heavy vehicle. Carefully drive the vehicle onto the rubber part of the tire, not the metal rim. This will push the rubber down, forcing the bead out of its groove on the rim. You may need to drive over the rubber a few times to break it. The bead tends to be the most stubborn part, especially with older tires. Another way to loosen a bead is with a jack. Raise the vehicle on a jack, slide the tire underneath the jack, then lower the vehicle down onto the rubber part of the tire. If you have a hard time with the bead, you may be better off cutting through it with a sharp knife or saw. Be careful not to cut into the metal rim. This will destroy the tire, but if it is done correctly, it won't damage the rim."

        "The changer will have a separate metal tube that fits into the open end of the arm.",
        "Stick the rod's pointed end into the arm, then gradually push it down.",
        "This will push the wedge down onto the rubber, exposing the rim.",
        "To loosen the bead further, push down on the tire by hand or with your foot.",
        "Go around the entire wheel to free the rim.",
        "Flip the wheel over and separate the other side with the wedge.",
        "Turn the wheel over, hook it on the nub again, then press the wedge against the rubber.",
        "Push the arm down to easily separate the tire bead from the rim.",
        "Press against the rubber on all sides of the wheel to finish loosening the rim.",
        "To avoid scratching the rim, place a piece of paper, a rubber mat, or some other material on the changer's base.",
        "You only need to do this when you place the front side of the rim face down.",
        "Lay the tire on top of the changer and lock it in place.",
        "Set the tire on the changer's big spoke and position it so the smaller spoke passes through 1 of the lug nut holes.",
        "Wrap an old shirt around the center spoke, over the top of the rim.",
        "Then, set the bracket piece and top cap on the center spoke.",
        "Twist the cap counterclockwise to lock the tire in place.",
        "The bracket piece looks like a flat cylinder with 4 spokes.",
        "If you don't have an old shirt to use, try placing pieces of rubber between the bracket and the rim.",
        "Doing this protects the rim from scratches.",
        "Pour liquid dish soap around the lip of the rim.",
        "Pull the rim up slightly so you are able to reach under it.",
        "Spread generous amounts of soap around and underneath it.",
        "The soap lubricates the rim, making the tire easier to remove.",
        "A regular grease-cutting soap will do a lot of good for used tires.",
        "Other substances, including cooking oil and WD-40, may also help.",
        "For the best results, get tire lube from an auto parts store.",
        "Pry the tire over the lip of the rim with the changing rod.",
        "Detach the rod from the changer's arm you used earlier to break the tire bead.",
        "Slide the pointed end between the rim and the tire.",
        "Then, leverage the rubber over the rim.",
        "Work all the way around the wheel to do this on all sides.",
        "Using a pry bar or a similar tool also works well.",
        "The best tools to use are ones with wide, flat blades, since they are less likely to scratch the rim.",
        "Keep the shirt or other material in place for protection.",
        "Repeat prying the bottom side of the wheel until you can remove the rim.",
        "Leave the wheel in place on the tire changer.",
        "Pull the rubber back so you are able to slide the rod down to the rim's bottom lip.",
        "Pull the bar back to lift the tire over the rim.",
        "Continue doing this on all sides of the wheel until you are able to lift the tire off of the changer.",
        "The tire changer is a great way to fit a new tire onto the rim without much hassle.",
        "Basically, you do the steps in reverse.",
        "You use the arm to leverage the tire onto the rim, then replace the valve stem and add air."
