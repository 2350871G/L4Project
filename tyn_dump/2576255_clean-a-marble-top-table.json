If you don\u2019t have a dust mop, use a microfiber cloth or a feather duster to clean the tabletop. Avoid using a vacuum to clean dust and dirt off of marble, since the edge of the vacuum cleaner hose may scratch the sensitive marble surface. Even if you\u2019re not planning to use a liquid cleaner afterwards, you should still dust your marble tabletop at least once every 2-3 days just to keep it clean. Dirt can be abrasive and damaging to a marble tabletop, so it\u2019s best to do regular cleanings to protect your table."
