Clear out the flesh of the coconut, and place the side with the 3 holes upside down over your baking soda cup. If there is no groove, you can make one with a knife or other sharp object.

This will make enough lava solution for several eruptions. Since vinegar is an acid, it will react with the baking soda (which is a base) in what is known as a neutralization reaction. This releases carbon dioxide gas and ultimately causes fizzing and bubbling that these volcanoes are known for. The gas that\u2019s released also builds the pressure necessary to force the \u201clava\u201d out of the volcano."

As the vinegar and baking soda react, they release gases that must move through the soap to escape. This causes the soap to bubble up, much like when you blow bubbles outside. About 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of soap should work well, but you can experiment with more or less to change how your lava looks."

You should only need a few drops, but again, you can try adding more or less to see how it changes your lava. Just be careful not to get the food coloring on any easily stained surfaces or on clothes. Using washable paint is a good alternative to using food coloring. It is less likely to stain surfaces or hands, and still gives your lava a fun color!"

    "text": " Building Your Coconut Volcano Choose a space that is easy to clean. This is a messy project so find an area that can cope with getting a little messy, or work in an area that can be covered thoroughly with newspaper (such as the kitchen counter or table). You can skip the messy newspaper if you do the experiment outside on gravel. Another suggestion is to do it in the bathtub (during a bathtime is even better since the lava will start to change the color of the bath water). Put some baking soda in a small cup. You want to add about 1 cup (221 g) of baking soda inside your volcano. You can use an empty yogurt cup or other plastic container to hold the baking soda underneath the volcano shell. Just be sure that the cup is clean and dry. Prepare the coconut. Start by using a screwdriver to open up 1 or more of the holes on the top of the coconut.

Any steps involving a knife, screwdriver, or other potential safety hazard should be done or supervised by an adult. Add some toys and props. You can set some plants or toy trees around the volcano. Then add a few dinosaurs or forest animals to the scene. This will help kids stretch their imaginations and make the volcano even more fun. You can also make up a story to go along with the erupting volcano. Making a Lava Solution Pour some plain vinegar into another small cup. A plastic cup will be fine for this step, too.
