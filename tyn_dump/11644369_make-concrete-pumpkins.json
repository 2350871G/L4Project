However, it's even more important to protect yourself from breathing in concrete dust, so work in a ventilated area and wear a dust mask. You can typically buy a dust mask wherever you buy your concrete supplies.

Using a Plastic Pumpkin as a Mold Wear a dust mask and protective clothing and lay down a tarp.

        "Then, add about 6  c (1.4 l) of water a little at a time, mixing it thoroughly with a trowel or a sturdy, long-handled spoon.",
        "The concrete mixture should be about the consistency of a thick cake or brownie batter.",
        "This will be enough concrete to fill 2 pumpkin pails approximately 8 in (20 cm) in diameter.",
        "Variation: To make a lightweight version of concrete, known as hypertufa, mix 2 parts dry concrete mix, 1 part peat moss, and 1 part perlite.",
        "Add the same amount of water that you would for regular concrete mix.",
        "Fill a plastic pumpkin with the concrete to about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top.",
        "Use your large spoon or trowel to scoop concrete into a plastic jack-o-lantern style pumpkin.",
        "Fill it up almost all the way, leaving about 1 in (2.5 cm) of space at the top so you can insert your center form.",
        "If there's a plastic handle on your pumpkin mold, use scissors to cut it off before you add the concrete.",
        "If you want to use your pumpkin as a planter, place a square of Styrofoam in the bottom of the plastic mold before you add the concrete.",
        "Push a disposable cup or bottle into the center of the wet concrete.",
        "Take a plastic cup or bottle and press it down into the concrete mix.",
        "Push it down far enough that the lip of the cup or bottle is even with the top of the plastic pail.",
        "This will create a hollow recess in the center of the pumpkin, which you can use to hold candy, a candle, or even a plant.",
        "Make sure the cup you use is sturdy enough to hold its shape as you push it into the concrete, but thin enough that you'll be able to easily cut it away when the concrete is dry.",
        "A disposable drinking cup is a good option.",
        "If you put a Styrofoam block in the bottom of the mold, make sure your cup or bottle touches the Styrofoam.",
        "If the concrete overflows as you push down the cup, wipe away the excess with a paper towel.",
        "Tap the pumpkin firmly on the ground to remove air bubbles.",
        "Lift the pumpkin 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) off the ground, then firmly tap it on a solid surface.",
        "Do this at least 3-4 times to help push any air bubbles to the top.",
        "The more times you do this, the smoother your pumpkin will be when it's dry.",
        "You can also tap the sides of the pumpkin firmly with your trowel or spoon.",
        "Cover the top of the bucket with a brick or other heavy object.",
        "As the concrete dries, it may push the cup or bottle out of the plastic pail.",
        "To prevent that, add a heavy weight to the top to hold the cup in place.",
        "Make sure to use something that it's okay to stain, since it may get concrete on it.",
        "Let the concrete dry for at least 24-48 hours.",
        "Place the plastic pumpkin in a dry place where it can sit undisturbed for a day or 2.",
        "Don't rush the drying process, since if you unmold the pumpkin before it's ready, it will crumble.",
        "It can take up to a month for concrete to be fully cured, but after 1-2 days, it should be dry enough to hold its shape outside of the mold.",
        "Use a utility knife to carefully remove the pail and cup.",
        "Carefully score along the plastic pumpkin pail with a craft or utility knife.",
        "If you need to, peel the plastic away in sections.",
        "Then, make a cut on the inside of the cup or bottle in the center of the pumpkin and pull it away, as well.",
        "If you placed Styrofoam in the bottom of the pumpkin, use your craft knife to cut it away, as well.",
        "Let the pumpkin finish drying for another 1-2 days.",
        "Even though the pumpkin will hold its shape at this point, it's best to wait another few days before you paint the concrete or add any decorations.",
        "After that, though, you'll have a durable, unique jack-o-lantern that you can use again and again!"
