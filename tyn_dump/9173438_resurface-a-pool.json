        "The smallest traces of dirt or debris could potentially ruin your new surface material\u2019s ability to set up correctly.",
        "Strip the existing materials.",
        "Plaster, fiberglass and composite finishes will have to be sandblasted or otherwise chiseled away to the underlying concrete in order to provide a better hold for the new material.",
        "Focus on one small area of the pool's surface at a time and move the nozzle of the sandblaster up and down to eat away at the liner.",
        "The stripping process will typically take 1-3 days, depending on the size of your pool and crew.",
        "Wear the proper safety equipment\u2014at the minimum, you\u2019ll need a respirator or filtration mask, eye protection and a pair rugged work gloves.",
        "It can cost thousands of dollars to have a pool sandblasted professionally and hundreds to rent and operate a sandblaster yourself.",
        "Keep this in mind when coming up with your projected budget.",
        "Dispose of the stripped materials.",
        "Use a wet/dry vacuum to suction up as much dust and debris as you can from in and around the pool area.",
        "Then, gather up your tarps or drop cloths and transport them somewhere where they can be sprayed off with a hose without making a mess.",
        "Cleanup can be very involved, and may require you to tack on an extra day or two to your project timeline.",
        "One of the perks of having your pool professionally resurfaced is that the contractor's team is responsible for getting your pool area put back in order.",
        "Applying Various Finishes Schedule your project for the right time.",
        "Settle on a stretch where weather conditions will be most favorable for the materials you're working with.",
        "For instance, epoxy paints, fiberglass and materials like concrete and grouting set fastest in warm, dry weather, while little rain or humidity may not hurt fresh plaster, since the moisture in the atmosphere will keep it from drying too quickly.",
        "Stay on top of your local forecast in the days before you begin resurfacing.",
        "It's possible for precipitation and extremes in temperature to interfere with the resurfaced pool\u2019s dry time.",
        "Similarly, gusty winds could blow dirt, leaves and other debris into wet paint or plaster before it's had time to dry.",
        "Choose a basic surfacing material.",
        "Nowadays, pool owners have a wide range of options available to pick from.",
        "For most small or standard pools, a simple plaster or fiberglass finish is a practical choice, as they're readily available and aren't overly difficult to install.",
        "They also tend to be the most affordable, which is a plus if you happen to be working under budget constraints.",
        "Plaster doesn\u2019t tend to last as long as synthetic or composite materials, so it will likely need to be replaced more frequently.",
        "Go with a long-lasting finish.",
        "High-end pools cut a very impressive appearance when surfaced with materials like pebble concrete, quartz or ceramic tile.",
        "These types of materials offer a durable lining that resists algae, stains and chemical-related damage.",
        "Read up on the benefits and drawbacks of different surfacing materials and take them into consideration when making your final selection.",
        "Brush on an epoxy paint.",
        "Roll on a pool specific epoxy primer from one end of the pool to the other.",
        "Once the primer is dry to the touch, roll on 3-4 coats of topcoat epoxy, using a handheld brush to touch up hard-to-reach spot.",
        "Sand the epoxy lightly between coats to ensure that the subsequent coat will stick properly.",
        "Each coat will require 2-3 hours of drying time, but may take longer depending on the climate in your area.",
        "Use only pool specific types of epoxy.",
        "These are available at most home improvement centers and pool and spa stores, and often come in kits that include detailed instructions for DIY application.",
        "More and more pool owners are going with epoxy finishes because they\u2019re cheap, durable, offer a strong seal and are easy to reapply later.",
        "Spread fresh plaster by hand.",
        "Combine the dry plaster components with water in a large drum or tub until it reaches a thick, smooth consistency.",
        "Spread the plaster over the entire surface of the pool with a trowel, being careful to avoid gaps or inconsistencies in thickness.",
        "For the most durable and attractive surface, aim for a finish that\u2019s between \u00bc\u201d and \u215c\u201d (.64-.95cm)\nWhen mixing your own plaster, it\u2019s best to use a ratio of two parts fine white silica sand to one part extra fine cement powder.",
        "A power trowel may come in handy for smoothing pool floors with large surface areas.",
        "Apply fiberglass in multiple coats.",
        "Starting with a thin seal coat, user a paint roller or sprayer to cover the walls and floor of the pool with the flexible liquid.",
        "Spray a coat of resin over the top, then roll and sand the layers to smooth them before leaving them to cure.",
        "The completed finish should be roughly 3/16\u201d thick.",
        "Fiberglass clings to whatever it touches, so be sure to wear a change of old clothes that you don\u2019t mind ruining.",
        "Allow the new surface to dry.",
        "No matter what material you decide on, it will need plenty of time to set up once it\u2019s in place.",
        "A basic epoxy paint will usually dry in a matter of hours or overnight, while more temperamental materials like plaster and fiberglass may require days to cure completely.",
        "Plaster cures best underwater, so there\u2019s no need to hold off on refilling your pool once the initial set is complete.",
        "Inspect the pool inside and out.",
        "Double check that the plumbing fixtures and lighting elements are properly sealed and functional before you begin adding water to the pool.",
        "This will also be your last chance to take care of any last minute details like sanding or touching up bare spots you may have missed.",
        "Never fill a swimming pool with visible holes, cracks or exposed concrete.",
        "This can easily lead to leaks, which are very expensive to repair and will force you to drain the pool all over again.",
        "Bad wiring in underwater lights could become a safety hazard when swimming.",
        "Refill the pool.",
        "Once the new surface materials have dried, the only thing left to do is fill the pool up with fresh water.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to add the right proportions of chlorine or salt to balance the water\u2019s pH levels and keep unwanted flora and fauna from moving in.",
        "You\u2019ll now be able to enjoy a dip in your newly renovated pool!",
        "A water truck or hydrant will allow you to refill your pool much faster than a standard garden hose."
