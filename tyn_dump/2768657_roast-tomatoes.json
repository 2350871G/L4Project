        "At a high temperature like this, tomatoes roast in half an hour or less.",

        "Your cooking time may vary depending on your oven and the settings you use.",
        "Place the tomatoes on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.",
        "Since this recipe doesn\u2019t use oil, you need the parchment paper to prevent the tomatoes from sticking and burning.",
        "Arrange the tomatoes in a single layer on the sheets.",
        "For larger batches of tomatoes, you will need multiple sheets.",
        "Mix balsamic vinegar with herbs and spices.",
        "For a basic vinegar mixture, pour about 1 \u20442 tablespoons (22 mL) of a quality balsamic vinegar into a separate bowl.",

        "For an easy way to season the tomatoes, try using your favorite balsamic vinaigrette.",
        "Be aware of the ingredients, since vinaigrettes already contain oil, sugar, salt, and pepper.",
        "Customize the vinegar mix to your liking.",
        "For example, try using less black pepper or sprinkling the tomatoes with grated Parmesan cheese after basting them.",
        "Baste the tomatoes with the mixture.",
        "If you have a basting brush, use it to spread the balsamic seasoning around.",
        "Otherwise, scoop up some of the mixture with a spoon.",
        "Slowly drizzle the balsamic over the tomatoes, coating them all as evenly as possible.",
        "Use a small spoon to avoid adding too much of the mixture to each tomato.",

        "That way, they don\u2019t burn despite being exposed to heat over a long period of time.",
        "Slow-roasting removes more moisture from the tomatoes, leading to more intense flavors.",
        "Place the tomatoes on a clean metal baking rack over a baking sheet.",
        "Fit the baking rack over a baking tray or a dish of a similar size.",
        "Spread the tomatoes out in a single layer across the rack, keeping the cut sides face up.",
        "The tray helps drain the tomatoes so they dry out more efficiently.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a baking rack, line the sheet with parchment paper or put the tomatoes directly on the sheet.",
        "Any juice in the pan will steam the tomatoes, so make sure they\u2019re well-cleaned before putting them in the oven.",
        "Drizzle olive oil over the tomatoes.",
        "Coat the tomatoes with about 5 tablespoons (74 mL) of oil.",
        "If you have a basting brush, brush the tomatoes with generous amounts of the oil.",

        "All of these extras are optional, as the critical part is the oil and salt.",
        "Sprinkle on about 1 tablespoon (12.50 g) of sugar to reduce the acidity from the tomatoes if desired.",
        "Roast the tomatoes for 4 to 6 hours.",
        "The tomatoes will retain their shape despite shrinking and looking wrinkled.",
        "Make sure the tomatoes have a dark red color and look a little browned around the edges.",
        "To increase their flavor, roast the tomatoes for longer.",
        "They can be safely left in the oven for up to 8 hours.",
        "Cool the tomatoes before using or storing them.",
