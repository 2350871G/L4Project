    "text": " Locating and Loosening the Membrane Unwrap your ribs. Remove your ribs from their butcher paper and pat them dry with paper towels. Discard the soiled paper towels in the trash. Resist the urge to rinse the meat, which can cause cross-contamination in your kitchen and prevent browning. Turn the rack of ribs so it is curved side down. Place your ribs on a clean surface, such as a cutting board or baking sheet. Orient the ribs so the concave side is facing up and the curved side of the ribs is flat against the board or baking sheet. You\u2019ll know the ribs are the right way up when the side with the thick white membrane is facing you. Use a sharp knife to get beneath the membrane. Locate a rib near the middle of the rack by feeling for a firm bone with your fingertips. At the base of that rib on the side closest to you, hold your knife horizontally and push the sharp tip of a paring knife between the rib and the membrane covering it. Press the knife between the rib and membrane until the entire blade is covered by membrane. Take care not to press the sharp tip of the knife through the membrane. Lift the membrane with the dull edge of the knife. Turn your paring knife vertically against the rib so the flat, unsharpened edge of the knife lifts the membrane slightly. The sharp edge of the knife will be against the rib bone. A small space of air should open up between the bone and membrane. If you\u2019re not confident in your knife skills, slide a dull butter knife into the gap created by your sharp knife to loosen the membrane. This lessens the chances you accidentally cut through the silver skin. Tilt the knife up at a 30-degree angle. Press the sharp side of your knife against the rib bone and lift upward with the handle of the knife. Keep the sharp side of the knife in contact with the rib. This hinge motion will help lift the membrane further. Remove your knife from the ribs and set it aside. Pulling the Membrane off Your Ribs Work your finger into the gap between the bone and membrane. Press your index finger into the space the knife has opened up under the membrane. Wiggle your finger from side to side to separate the membrane further and enlarge the gap. Try to lift enough of the membrane with your finger so that there is a grip-able flap of membrane tissue. Use a paper towel to grip the membrane. Place a clean paper towel on top of your dominant palm so it covers your index finger and thumb. Grasp the paper towel in your hand, and use it to grip the loose edge of the membrane between your thumb and index finger. The paper towel will give you extra traction while holding the strong and slippery membrane. Work your fingers beneath the membrane to the other side of the ribs. Hold the ribs steady with your non-dominant hand, and pull up on the membrane flap using the paper towel in your dominant hand. As you lift, press the fingers of your non-dominant hand through to the other side of the rib. Your fingers will emerge on the other side, creating a small loop of membrane. If the membrane starts to tear as you lift up, use your knife to separate the rib and membrane on the opposite side of the ribs to meet the side you\u2019ve been working on. Pull the membrane up and away from the ribs. Slip two fingers of your dominant hand into the membrane \u201chandle\u201d that\u2019s been formed by the space between the rib and the membrane. Press down on the ribs with your other hand, and pull the membrane straight up and off the ribs. It should come off in one piece. If your rack of ribs is very long, readjust your grip on the membrane as needed, moving closer to the edge to lift the membrane all the way off. If your grip slips as you pull up on the membrane, grab a paper towel and grip through that for more traction. Discard the membrane. Throw the thick, silvery membrane that comes away from the ribs into the trash. Your ribs are now clean and ready to be seasoned and cooked to suit your taste.",
