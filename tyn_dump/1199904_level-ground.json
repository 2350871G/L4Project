This area does not need to be perfectly square or rectangular unless you are planning on using sod instead of simply replanting your grass. Drive wooden or plastic stakes around the area to be leveled. Use a string level. Attach strings to stretch between the stakes, a few inches above the ground. Attach a string level to the strings to determine the high point. This will usually be your starting point and the rest of the ground will be brought to here, but you can also lower some ground if that makes more sense for your project. Adjust the strings.

Keep in mind that you may want to adjust the grade of your land to help combat drainage problems. Your land should be graded 1\" for every 4', leading away from your home.

Get your seed, as well as a hand spreader or other tool to spread the seed evenly. Lightly cover with more soil. Lightly cover the seeds with a sprinkling of topsoil and lightly tamp it down. Water lightly. Mist the area with water 4 times a day for at least 2 days to encourage the seeds to germinate. Reseed as necessary. Give the grass time to grow in and then reseed areas where the grass does not grow in to your satisfaction. Alternatively, buy sod.
