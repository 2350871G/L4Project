        "In most cases, grease and dirt will be built up inside it.",
        "Dip a rag into paint thinner and wipe around the exterior of the hub.",
        "Then poke the rag through the hub opening to clean the interior.If the hub is dented or out of shape, the wheel may need total replacement.",
        "Bring it to a bike shop for an assessment.",
        "Dry all of the parts with a clean rag.",
        "If any of the parts have paint thinner on them, it\u2019ll dissolve the new grease and prevent it from lubricating the hub.",
        "Take a dry rag that you haven\u2019t used for any paint thinner and wipe down all the parts, including the inside of the hub.",
        "Rebuilding the Hub Reinstall the freehub body with a 10mm Allen key.",
        "Slide the freehub body through the hub opening.",
        "Then insert a 10mm Allen key into the slot and turn it clockwise to tighten the freehub.",
        "Apply grease to each side of the hub to house the bearings.",
        "Use a grease injector and squeeze dabs of grease around the hub opening.",
        "Make sure the grease doesn\u2019t go above the hub border.",
        "Then, flip the wheel over and apply grease to the other side.There are several types of bicycle grease available, but lithium-based grease is best to prevent water intrusion and rusting.",
        "Drop one bearing at a time into the grease.",
        "Take one bearing at a time and press it into the grease.",
        "Continue pressing down bearings until you fill all the space around the hub.",
        "Then do the same on the other side.Remember to place the same number of bearings on each side as you removed.",
        "That\u2019s why counting them is important.",
        "Dropping the bearings in with a pair of tweezers helps you place them more precisely and avoids getting grease on your hands.",
        "Rebuild one side of the axle with the cone, spacer, and nut.",
        "Take the axle and first replace the cone.",
        "Screw the cone down to the bottom of the threaded part of the axle.",
        "Then drop the spacer on.",
        "Finish by screwing the nut onto the end.If you have trouble tightening the pieces by hand, use 2 wrenches.",
        "Lock one wrench around the cone and another around the nut, then turn the one around the nut clockwise.",
        "This tightens the whole section.",
        "Insert the axle into the wheel.",
        "Hold the axle by the end nut and drop it through the hub.",
        "Press it into the grease lining the hub so it sticks.",
        "Replace the parts on the other side of the axle.",
        "Flip the wheel around to expose the other side of the axle.",
        "Then replace the cone, spacer, and nut the same way on this side.",
        "Tighten up the pieces with a wrench.Spin the axle after you\u2019ve replaced all the pieces.",
        "It should turn smoothly, without any resistance.",
        "If the action seems jerky or tight, loosen the nut a bit.",
        "Reinstall the freewheel if you were working on a back wheel.",
        "Take the freewheel you removed and spin it onto the wheel clockwise.",
        "Then place the freewheel remover back onto the freewheel nut and turn it clockwise this time to tighten the part.",
        "Slide the skewer back through the axle.",
        "Take the skewer and remove the same nut and spring that you took off at the beginning.",
        "Slide the skewer through the axle until it stops.",
        "Then, put the spring back on and screw the nut onto the end.",
        "Tighten it up with a wrench so it won't fall off.Be careful taking the nut off the skewer or the spring could fly out.",
        "Put the wheel back on the bike.",
        "Once all the pieces are reattached, press the wheel back into its socket on the bike.",
        "Make sure you have a tight fit, then press the quick-release lever down to lock the wheel in place.If you were working on a rear wheel, loop the chain back around the freewheel.",
        "If your bike doesn't have quick-release levers, then press the wheel into the socket and attach a nut to the end of the axle.",
        "Tighten it up so the wheel is secure."
