Sand firstly with the rough one then the soft one. Don't sand too hard and friction causes heat! You will do a  far nicer job if you use an electric sander. Sanding all through is a very hard and frustrating job as the Sandpaper gets clogged up with the paint in no time.The most sensible thing to do is soft sanding once you're done with the old paint.

Make sure the surface is really smooth. If it is a small object, just simply dust it with a brush or blow it away. If there is wood dust on the floor, sweep it away. Heat Gun Method Now you may use a very dangerous but easier method. You will need a heat gun. Make sure you are wearing gloves to do this, goggles and a face mask and make sure water is close so the wood you're working on doesn't catch fire. Position the heat gun 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) above the painted wooden surface after you switch the heat gun on.

Pass the heat gun over the surface of the section of wood you are currently working on. Continue passing it side-to-side and up-and-down without ceasing. While the old paint is tender because of the heat - scrape the paint up as it wrinkles. Once the paint begins to bubble and wrinkle, immediately scrape the paint up with a broad paint scraper. Work on and on likewise on the next small areas until you do the whole object. Now you may pack everything up and turn off the Heat Gun so that nothing gets in your way. Now this is the hard part: The above mentioned final sanding and polishing. Stay calm if a fire starts. They are usually small flames. If a fire does start, turn off the plugs first then move out the heat gun and sprinkle the water onto the fire. Now you can make it smooth - scrape the object with  Sandpaper and your choice of grain. You use sandpaper because it makes the object smooth and it get rids of the paint you couldn't scrape off with the heat and the spatula. Chemical Stripper Method Now if it gets too bumpy, you may use a chemical stripper. Choose the right type of stripper as some vary from the purpose you are using it for. Read the instructions thoroughly before use. While the application procedure is the same for most chemical paint strippers, the exact details may vary. Always follow the instructions that come with the paint stripper. Liquid chemicals are often applied in spray form and are usually used to clean coatings or a couple of layers. Shake the can with the liquid and then you may pour all the content onto an open type of container.  Coat your paintbrush with enough liquid to cover a medium-sized area in a number of strokes. You can also use a spray but spray 4 inches (10 cm) away from the wood. Cover the object with the liquid using your coated paint brush. Brush the paint stripper on in one direction. Do not brush over areas that have already been covered by paint stripper. Leave it for a while (about 30 minutes to one hour/varies on how much you put) and you may realize that the paint is 'softening'.  Test if the paint worked.

Scraping Method If the situation is where the paint is thick or in large amounts such as a blob, you could use a scraper.

Refinishing Wood If you would like to varnish the wood; Simply coat the wood with Clear Timber Varnish and or any polisher.  Don't apply too much coat. Remember to apply three coats in this order: Apply the polishing coat.  Sand the wood.  Apply another layer of the polishing coat.  Sand the wood with really fine grains.  Apply the last coat. Don't sand after that coat! If you would like to paint the wood, paint in one direction only. Also, apply coats on top of each other when each one dries.
