Tropical punch creates a brighter red while cherry produces a deeper red. In the cooler spectrum, blue raspberry results in blue and lime creates a bright green. Mixed berry can result in a light blue. Note that the colors can appear differently on different hair types and base colors. For instance, grape Kool-Aid will leave a light pinkish violet on light blonde hair when left on for just 30 minutes. However, grape Kool-Aid will show up as a deep reddish purple on dark brown hair after 1 hour. If you have brown hair, vibrant reds usually show up the best. You can also try deep purple and dark blue! You won\u2019t be able to get a lighter color than your natural shade without first bleaching your hair, though."

To avoid this, slip on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves or disposable latex gloves to keep the dye from soaking into your skin.

Consider wrapping a large garbage bag around your shoulders and clipping it in place to keep any moisture from getting through. Also protect your workspace with another towel or garbage bag in case any dye drips onto your chair, the table, or the floor. Dyeing All of Your Hair Divide your hair into 3 to 6 sections.

Start with 1 section and massage or paint the dye into your roots. Then spread the dye down the strands, all the way to the tips, until the first section is completely coated.

If you\u2019ve used more Kool-Aid packets, it\u2019s ok to leave the dye on for a shorter amount of time. Rinse the Kool-Aid dye paste out of your hair with cold running water.

Adding Streaks of Color Lay a piece of saran wrap or aluminum foil behind 1 section of hair.

Place the wrap or foil right at the root of your hair and use your hand to support it from behind.

If you\u2019re creating narrow highlights, try picking up and painting a few thin strands on the same piece of saran wrap or foil.

Depending on the natural color and thickness of your hair and the deepness of the color you want to achieve, leave the dye on for as long as you want. If you want a really saturated hue, leave the dye on for 5 hours. If you have light hair and you just want a light tint, don\u2019t leave the dye on for longer than 1 hour. Rinse the dye out of your hair under cold running water. When you\u2019re ready to rinse out the dye, unwrap each strand with gloved hands and discard the pieces of saran wrap or foil. Then use cool running water to rinse out your strands until the water runs clear. Dip-Dyeing the Ends in a Dye Bath Add 3 to 4 unsweetened Kool-Aid packets to 2  c (470 mL) of hot water. Instead of making a creamy paste that you\u2019ll paint onto your hair, you\u2019ll create a dye bath in which you\u2019ll dip the ends of your hair. Empty the Kool-Aid packets into a bowl of hot water and stir to dissolve the powder. Allow the water to cool slightly, for around 3 to 5 minutes. Choose whichever Kool-Aid color you want, or mix 2 together for a custom shade. Use more packets for more saturated color, especially if you have dark hair. Part your hair down the middle to create 2 pigtail sections. Make sure your hair is clean and dry before you dye it. As you\u2019re waiting for the water to cool, divide your hair into 2 sections, a right and a left section. Put 1 section in front of each shoulder, and use a hair tie to secure each section into pigtails. Dip the ends of each pigtail into the dye bath. Keep your strands submerged in the bowl of Kool-Aid dye for about 15 to 30 minutes. If you have darker hair or want a deeper color, leave your hair in the dye bath longer. But if you have light or fine hair, 15 minutes might be enough to give your ends a bright pop of color. Try dipping your hair into the dye bath a few times for a deeper color. This also helps if you want to create a softer division between your dip-dyed ends and the rest of your hair. Scrunch your damp strands with a paper towel to remove the excess liquid. Once the time is up, pull your pigtails out of the dye bath and squeeze the excess liquid back into the bowl. Use a paper towel to squeeze the remaining moisture from your hair. Make sure you\u2019re still wearing gloves during this process, as the Kool-Aid can stain your hands. Wrap the strands in a plastic bag if you want to let the dye soak in longer. For a richer color, or for darker hair, let the dye seep into your strands for a while longer. Use a hair tie to secure the plastic bag or a long strand of saran wrap around your dip-dyed ends. This will hold in some of the moisture while the dye permeates your hair. Keep this in place for up to 2 hours, or until your strands start to get dry. If you want to leave the dye on for up to 5 hours, the method of painting on a dye paste containing hair conditioner would be a better choice. Conditioner keeps the dye from drying out, whereas the dye bath liquid will evaporate after a short while. Rinse out your hair until the cool water runs clear. Without using any shampoo, rinse your hair thoroughly under cool water to remove all of the dye. Keep rinsing for about 10 or 20 minutes until the water runs clear, or very close to clear. Once the dye is rinsed off, air-dry or blow-dry your hair to see the final results.",
