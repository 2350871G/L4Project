                    "description": "If you\u2019re going to use a straightening or curling iron on your hair daily, it\u2019s important that to select one that\u2019s made with a material that will do the least damage to your hair. Inexpensive irons are usually made with metal that doesn\u2019t heat evenly so it can easily burn your hair. You'll pay more for an iron made with a higher quality material, but it will help minimize damage. Ceramic irons heat quickly and evenly, so they\u2019re not as likely to burn your hair. They also produce negative ions that help smooth cuticle and boost shine. Be sure to choose an iron that\u2019s made of ceramic and not just coated with it. A ceramic coating will eventually wear off over time. Tourmaline irons can produce 6 times the amount of negative ions that ceramic models do. As a result, you\u2019re left with smooth, shiny, healthy looking hair. Titanium irons are usually the most expensive, but they heat quickly and evenly. They\u2019re a particularly good option for thick or coarse hair."

To keep your hair from getting damaged, you want to use the lowest heat possible to give you your desired style.

In general, an iron that allows you to set the temperature between 175 degrees to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees to 200 degrees Celsius) is sufficient for all hair types.

Start at 175 degrees (80 degrees Celsius), and only raise the temperature if your hair isn\u2019t curling or straightening properly.
