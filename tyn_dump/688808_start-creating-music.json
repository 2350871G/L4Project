Many DAWs also have built-in software instruments that you can play using your computer\u2019s keyboard and use in your music. Search for DAWs that work with your computer\u2019s operating system and compare the features and prices to see which one fits best for your needs. If you want the easiest experience, try using Garageband or Logic Pro on Mac, or Reaper on Mac and PC. For more advanced software, try using FL Studio, Pro Tools, or Cubase. All of the DAWs are available for Mac or PC. If you want to focus only on electronic music, opt for Ableton, Bitwig Studio, or Reason. Many DAWs offer free trial periods so you can try them before you purchase them. DAWs can be complex at first, so look up tutorials on how to use the interface and program so you learn all of the settings you can access."
