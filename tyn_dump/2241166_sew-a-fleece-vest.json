Measure the front of your vest, starting at the collar and finishing 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom hem. Purchase a separating zipper that matches your measurement and open it up. If you cannot find the right length, buy a longer zipper. Pin a separating zipper face-down to the right side of the vest. The bottom of the zipper should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the vest. The side of the zipper tape should be \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) away from the edge of the fabric.
