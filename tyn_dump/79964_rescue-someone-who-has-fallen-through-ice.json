        "If you want to prevent future falls through the ice, you should always know the thickness of the ice where you'll be fishing, walking, snowboarding, or doing whatever it is you do on the ice.",
        "You can check the thickness of the ice by using an ice chisel, ice auger, cordless drill, or tape measure, and by calling the local bait shop or lakeside resort to ask about the ice conditions in the area.",
        "Here are the appropriate thicknesses for each activity:\n2\"  (5 cm) or less: Stay off the ice.",
        "The ice is too thin and won't support your weight.",
        "4\" (10 cm): appropriate for ice fishing or other on-foot activities.",
        "5\" (12.5 cm): okay for a snowmobile or ATV.",
        "8\" - 12\" (20.5 - 30.5 cm): okay for a car or a small pickup.",
        "12\" - 15\": (20.5 - 38 cm) appropriate for a medium-sized truck."
