Different spices have different strengths, so feel free to experiment. The range given is a good starting point, from 2 tsp (10 mL) for a touch of flavor, up to 10 tsp (50 mL) for a strong flavor. Cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and nutmeg are all commonly used in desserts, making them an obvious option to pair with sugar. These work well alone or in any combination with each other. Cayenne sugar is a flavor for the fearless, adding a bold garnish to a plate or cocktail. Unsweetened cocoa powder, instant coffee, or other flavorful powders can also be added using this method.
