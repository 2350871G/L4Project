This is very important because if you are shooting a 30-06 and you have a .22 scope mounted on it, very bad things will happen! For example, your scope will probably fly off your rifle and could injure you or those around you. Make sure the mounts are tight, and if necessary, use lock-tite on the screws."

Secure the rifle in a bipod, on sandbags, or just any other method to hold the rifle steady while you sight it. Make sure no part of the rifle is resting on a hard surface. If you have a bolt-action rifle, remove the bolt and look down the bore, aligning the bore with the target. If you have a single-shot rifle, open the action. Note: auto-loader rifles and pumps cannot be bore sighted this way. Adjust the rifle stand so that when looking through the breech end, the 100-yard target is centered in your view. Without moving the rifle, adjust your scope so that the cross-hairs are aligned on the same object. Your rifle is now bore-sighted to 100 yards (91.4 m)."
