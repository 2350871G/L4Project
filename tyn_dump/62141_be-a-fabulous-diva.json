            "description": "Hair is one thing that everyone looks at; wear it naturally, however, you wish to, but make sure it looks as if you walked out of the salon. The nicer it is the more compliments, but the tackier it is, the more gossip. Wash your hair every day or every other day. If you are African-American wash once a week or whatever works for you. Educate yourself on what works best for your hair. If you need to, use products that add shine, volume, and most of all can stay. Always comb and brush your hair. Work with your natural hair texture. For example, if you have waves or curls, invest in a curl-defining mousse or cream to keep them pretty and to prevent the frizz. Or if your hair is naturally straight, use a straightener in the morning and a shine spray to keep it from becoming limp and lifeless."

Wash you face with a mild wash, tone it, and moisturize it. If you have acne try seeing a doctor if results do not show within 3 months. Don't forget to drink at least 8 glasses of water (64oz.) a day to help your skin glow and to get rid of toxins. Exfoliate at least twice a week."
