You can use the same color for both pieces of fleece, or contrasting colors. You can even choose a pattern for one piece, and a solid color for the other. Cut the fabric down to the length you need. Make sure that both pieces match up perfectly. You can make the blanket as large or as small as you like, but keep in mind that fleece rarely comes wider than 60 inches (152.4 centimeters). Consider cutting the fabric about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) longer and wider than you want it to be. You will be cutting strips into the fabric, and then tying the strips into knots. This will cause the blanket to \"shrink\" slightly. Consider adding a cotton or polyester quilt batting. Trim it down so that it is 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) smaller than all four sides of your fleece pieces. Sandwich the batting between the fleece pieces.

You will end up with a fringe all around your blanket. Use a ruler to make the measurements exact. If you need to draw some guidelines, use a fabric marker. The ink will either disappear over time or when you wash the blanket. Tie all the strips together into a double knot. Take the bottom piece and the top piece and tie them in any knot you like.

Using Iron-On Seam Tape Choose two large pieces of fabric. It does not matter what type of fabric you use, as you will be using seam tape to fuse them together.

If you can't find any iron-on seam tape, you can try using fabric glue instead. Keep in mind, however, that the glue will make your fabric stiffer. Set aside one of the \"width\" pieces of iron-on seam tape. You will be using it later. Fold down the top 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of each piece of fabric, and iron it. Make sure that you are folding inward, towards the wrong side. Also, make sure that you are folding one of the narrow ends, not the wide. These folded parts will make the \"opening\" to your blanket, so that you can later \"hem\" it shut. Place one of the fabric pieces down, right-side up. Make sure that the folded part is facing upwards, away from you. Align the three pieces of iron-on seam tape along the bottom and side edges of the fabric. Do not place any iron-on seam tape on the top, folded edge. If you need to, pin the iron-on seam tape in place. Stick the pins vertically into the fabric, with the ball/head part sticking out beyond the edge of the fabric. This way, you can pull them out. Place the second piece of fabric, right-side down, on top. Make sure that the folded top edge is facing away from you. It should be aligned with the folded top edge of the bottom fabric. If you need to, pin the two pieces of fabric together. Iron the edges of the fabric. Set your iron to the temperature specified by packaging from the iron-on seam tape. Run it over the bottom and side edges of your blanket. If you don't have the packaging anymore, then set your iron to the appropriate setting for the fabric you are using. Remove the pins, and flip the blanket inside out. Remember the hole you left along the top edge of the fabric? Pull your blanket through that hole. The seams should now be on the inside.
