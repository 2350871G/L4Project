Wearing it Long and Curled Cut strips out of flannel for wrapping your hair. Flannel has an appropriate thickness and is easy to tie together securely. You will want strips about 3 times the length of your hair and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide. Curling your hair with a flannel rag instead of heat is a great way to maintain the health of your hair and prevent damage to your long locks.

Separate your hair into sections. Once you decide how many curls you would like to put in your hair, separate your hair into even sections to ensure the curls will match.

Rub some lotion between your palms, then pull it through your section of hair until it is slightly damp, but not wet. Wrap your hair around the flannel strip. Place the flannel strip at the top of this section of hair, leaving about six inches of excess flannel at the top.

Once you have wrapped the rag all the way back to the top, tie it securely in a knot with the 6 inches (15.2 cm) of flannel you left at the top when you began. Wrap the rest of your hair around the flannel strips. Repeat this process with each section of hair, wrapping the hair around the rag, then the rag around the hair and tying it off.

Tying a Half Ponytail Separate the top half of your hair from the bottom half. Using your fingers, gather the top half of your hair. Place both index fingers at your temples, then run them upward, toward the crown of your head until they meet at the top. Gather this hair together in one hand. Avoid running your fingers directly across the back of your head from the temples. This will create an uneven split, putting most of your hair in the ponytail and only leaving a small portion on the bottom. Create a loop using a half ponytail. Wrap a rubber band around the hair you have gathered near the crown of your head. Wrap the rubber band until you feel it is secure. On the final wrap, pull most of the ponytail through, but leave the end in the rubber band, holding it in a large loop. Pull the sides of the loop to secure your half pony tail and give it a nice shape. Grab the hair closest to the rubber band between your thumb and forefinger. Using equal pressure on both sides, gently pull outward, putting pressure on the rubber band and forcing it closer to your scalp. You should feel the gathered hair tightening toward your scalp. Pull the hair in your half ponytail outward to give it more volume and shape. If some of your hair falls out of the rubber band, you will need to take the ponytail out and wrap it all again with the rubber band. Try two half ponytails for variety. Wrapping the top half of your hair into a loop leaves the bottom half free and long. Get the rest of your hair out of the way or mix up the style by repeating the half ponytail with the bottom half of your hair giving you two loops in the back, one above the other. Start the bottom ponytail underneath the top loop to hide the rubber band and create a stacked effect. Consider decorating with stylish hair pins between the two loops. Rolling Hair into a Loose, Folded Bun Gather your hair into a ponytail at the nape of your neck. Brush your hair well and secure it with a rubber band at the nape of your neck. Leave this pony tail loose and have some slack between your scalp and the rubber band. Pull your ponytail through the center of your hair between your scalp and the rubber band. Run both hands down the back of your head to find the center of your hair where it meets the rubber band. Separate the hair here with your fingers, creating a hole large enough to fit your pony tail. Fold your ponytail underneath the rubber band and through the hole. Grab the ponytail with the thumb and forefinger of you other hand to pull the entire ponytail up through the hole.

Repeat this two or three times, making a hole and pulling the ponytail through until you have rolls running down both sides of your head. Tuck the ends underneath the rolls to finish off the look. After you have created several inches of rolls on the sides of your head, fold your remaining hair under and tuck the ends into the center near your rubber band. Pin the ends securely to the scalp, creating a loosely folded bun in the back. Getting Creative with Chopsticks and Braids Put the top half of your hair in a ponytail. Run your fingers from your temple to the crown of your head to gather the top half of your hair. Wrap a rubber band around this portion of hair to create a ponytail to work with. Twist your ponytail into a bun. Start at the base of your ponytail and twist the hair in one direction. Take this rolled section around the rubber band in a circle. Continue layering circles around the outside of the last roll until you have reached the end of your ponytail and created a nice bun. Tuck the end of the ponytail under the the bun to hide the loose ends. Hold your bun in place with chopsticks. Hold the bun with one hand. With the other hand, push a chopstick into the side of he bun at the center. Angle the chopstick down toward the scalp, then back up into the bun to gather more hair and back down toward the scalp as you push the chopstick horizontally through the bun. Continue weaving the chopstick through the bun until it comes out the other side and holds the bun securely in place. Decorate with a second chopstick. One chopstick is enough to hold the bun securely in place, but you can use a second chopstick for the look. Insert the other chopstick at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal one, pushing it from the top corner of the bun and out the other side. Now that the top half is done, you can leave your hair like that if you like, or move on to braiding the loose section. Separate the rest of your hair into quarters. Run your fingers through the center of your loose hair to separate it into halves. Secure one half with a rubber band to get it out of the way, then split the other half into two even sections.
