They produce plenty of small or medium fruits and their maintenance level is more friendly for beginners. Pink variegated lemon trees also grow well indoors and are beginner-friendly. Buy a lemon tree at least 2-3 years old, as young trees may not grow as well indoors. Although you can grow lemon trees from seed, they are less likely to adapt to indoor climates and will not produce the same as their parent tree."

        "Rub the paintbrush against the plant's stamen and anthers, the pollen-covered buds around the middle of the plant's flowers.",
        "Transfer the pollen to the pistil, the bulb located deep in the center of the flower.",
        "Repeat this process once a day to ensure pollination.",
        "Most lemon trees take 6-9 months to harvest after being successfully pollinated.",
        "Your lemon tree may produce fruit even if you don't pollinate it, but the fruit will be larger if it is pollinated.",
        "Thin out any heavy lemon clusters that grow.",
        "Once a cluster of small lemons appears on your tree, remove 2/3 of them to allow the remaining 1/3 a chance to grow large.",
        "Snip away the extra lemons with pruning shears, cutting carefully at the stalk.",
        "Too many lemon clusters can drain your tree of energy and stunt all of the fruits' growth.",
        "Many trees will drop fruit on their own.",
        "Wait a few months before removing any fruit.",
        "Test the fruits for ripeness with your thumb.",
        "As your lemons grow, apply pressure with your thumb to the rind.",
        "If the inside feels soft and plump instead of hard, the plant is ready for you to harvest.",
        "The fruits can be left on the tree for awhile without becoming overripe.",
        "The fruits will usually stop growing once they're ready to harvest.",
        "They should also be a rich yellow color.",
        "Cut your lemons from the tree with pruning shears.",
        "Take the pruning shears and clip them off of the tree at the fruit stalk.",
        "If you don't have pruning shears, you can also carefully pull the lemon from the tree.",
        "Pull or cut gently to prevent damaging your plant.",
        "Store your lemons for 1-2 months on your kitchen counter or in your fridge.",
        "After harvesting your lemons, you can store them for 2-4 weeks on a counter and 1-2 months in a refrigerator.",
        "Avoid cutting your lemons until you're ready to use them, as cut lemons only last for 2-3 days in a fridge.",
        "If you want to store your lemons for longer, squeeze the juice and store it in an airtight container for 4-6 months in a fridge or freezer.",
        "Prune your plant's roots if it stops producing lemons.",
        "Your tree should remain root-bound in order to keep its size in check, but some potted lemon trees will stop producing fruit if their roots get too pot bound.",
        "Remove your tree from its pot and use a sharp knife to shave 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.5 centimeters) of the roots around the exterior of the root ball.",
        "Keep the roots moist while you walk by spritzing them with water from a spray bottle.",
        "Repot the tree and prune approximately 1/3 of its foliage to balance out the pruned roots."
