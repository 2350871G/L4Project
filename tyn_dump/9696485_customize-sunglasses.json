Be sure not to glue any on the hinge or you won\u2019t be able to close the arms. Glue small matching artificial flowers like daisies or sunflowers across the top rim of the glasses.

Brush a light coat of Mod Podge onto each arm and stick the paper down, trimming any excess paper. Coat the papered arms one at a time in Dimensional Magic, a very thick glue which will appear cloudy at first then dry thick and crystal clear, adding dimension to your decorated glasses.
