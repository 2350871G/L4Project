For the character\u2019s thoughts, you could choose a multitude of topics, related or unrelated. This could include people, events, dreams, emotions, activities, items, or anything else. It\u2019s sometimes easier to start with a broader topic if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve written stream-of-consciousness. Literally any topic will do, as long as you have something to say about it \u2013 even if it doesn't seem like much at first. Using this method, you can connect topics that seem unrelated. For example, you could begin discussing a certain character who loves roses and then immediately switch to a childhood memory of your mother\u2019s rose bushes. This is the way thoughts often work in our heads \u2013 so it is also a great way to show how a character thinks and connects ideas in their mind."

Remember that the point of this style of writing is to mirror how thoughts naturally flow through our heads, and people don\u2019t typically think in complete sentences with perfect grammar.
