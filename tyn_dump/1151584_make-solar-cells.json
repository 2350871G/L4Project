Clean the titanium dioxide off the conductive-side-down plate and place it where it won't collect dirt. Prepare a shallow dish filled with dye. The dye can be made from raspberry, blackberry or pomegranate juice or by brewing a tea from red hibiscus petals. Soak the titanium-dioxide-coated plate, coated side down, in the dye for 10 minutes.  Clean the other plate with alcohol. Do this while the titanium dioxide-coated plate is soaking. Retest the cleaned plate to find its conductive side. Mark the side that doesn't conduct with a plus sign (+). Apply a thin carbon coating to the conductive side of the cleaned plate. You can do this by going over the conductive side with a pencil or by applying a graphite lubricant. Cover the entire surface. Take the titanium-dioxide-coated plate out of the dye. Rinse it twice, first with de-ionized water and then with alcohol. Blot dry after rinsing with a clean tissue. Assembling the Solar Cell Place the carbon-coated plate onto the titanium-dioxide plate so the coatings touch. The plates should be slightly offset, about 5 millimeters (1/5 inch). Use binder clips on the long edges to hold them in place. Apply 2 drops of an iodide solution to the exposed coating. Let the solution soak through the plate coatings so they're covered completely.

Such a solution is called an electrolyte. Wipe excess solution off the exposed portions of the plates.  Activating and Testing the Solar Cell Attach an alligator clip to the exposed coated sections on either side of the solar cell.  Connect the black wire of the multimeter to the clip connected to the exposed titanium dioxide coating. This plate is the solar cell's negative electrode, or cathode. Connect the red wire of the multimeter to the clip connected to the exposed carbon coating. This plate is the solar cell's positive electrode, or anode. (In a previous step, you marked it with a plus sign on its non-conductive side.) Place the solar cell next to a light source, with the negative electrode facing the source. In a school classroom, this can be done by laying the cell on top of the lens of an overhead projector. In a home setting, another light source, such as a spotlight or the sun itself, can be substituted. Measure the current and voltage generated by the solar cell with the multimeter.
