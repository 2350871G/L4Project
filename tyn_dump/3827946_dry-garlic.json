                    "description": "After your garlic has grown for 5-6 months, begin inspecting the plants every week. Look to see if the leaves near the base of the plant have started to brown and wilt. Once these leaves are wilted, brush the dirt away around the garlic cloves. If the bulb is large and the cloves are fully formed, use a trowel to dig around the base of the plant. Once the soil is loose, physically pull the plant out of the ground to harvest your garlic. If the garlic won\u2019t come up easily, use your trowel to dig 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) underneath the bulb. This will tear up the root system and make the garlic easier to pull up. It\u2019s typically pretty easy to pull garlic out, though. This method applies to every variety of garlic, although some species will dry out a little faster than others. Typically, the larger the bulb, the more time it will take to dry out."
