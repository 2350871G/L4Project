You could also stack pallets and secure them together and to the deck. Usually, each tier, or stage, will have its skirt or wall of sorts around it."

You may want to ask the parade organizers if they have a qualified electrician to ask questions or take a look at your work. All cord and cables should be secured to prevent pinching, dragging and disconnection. The generator should be well-ventilated, far away from the passenger compartment, as quiet as possible, and operated where there is no risk of fire or fumes accumulating from it."
