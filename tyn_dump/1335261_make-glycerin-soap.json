If you're feeling ambitious, you can  make your own glycerin, but it's easier to buy blocks of clear glycerin, white glycerin, or a different color. Clear glycerin soap always looks a little transparent, no matter what color you choose. In addition to glycerin, you'll need the following supplies:\nEssential oils. Craft stores sell essential oils meant for use in glycerin soap. You'll only need a few drops to scent an entire batch of soap, so you can buy a small bottle. Choose  lemon verbena oil, rose oil, lavender oil, peppermint oil, or another oil you'd like to use to scent your soap. Soap molds. Craft stores sell many different types of molds, ranging from very small to very large in size. Be sure to get a type of mold that is usable for glycerin soap, which will pop right out of the mold as soon as it has set. Rubbing alcohol. If you don't already have some in your medicine cabinet, pick up a bottle at the drugstore. Pour some into a clean spray bottle; you'll need it to remove bubbles from the glycerin before it sets."

Place the glycerin pieces in a double boiler, fill the boiler with water, and place it over medium heat. Continue heating the glycerin until it is completely melted. If you don't have a double boiler, you can make one. Find two pots, a large one and a smaller one that fits inside. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water. Set the smaller pot inside the larger pot so that it floats on the water. Place the pots on a burner over medium heat. Put the glycerin chunks into the dry, smaller pot and allow them to melt. You can also melt the glycerin in the microwave. Place the chunks in a microwave safe bowl and heat them in 30 second increments until they are entirely melted. You can melt the entire block of glycerin or just cut off a little at a time until you've melted an amount that seems suitable for your soap-making project. The finished soaps will have the same mass and volume as the glycerin chunks, they'll just be reformed into pretty shapes."

Be careful not to let it overflow, or the soap will come out misshapen. If the soap is tricky to pour using your double boiler, use a funnel to pour it into a bottle or pitcher with a spout, then transfer the liquid to the soap molds. You'll have to do this quickly, though, so the soap doesn't get too cool before it makes it to the molds. If necessary, reheat the soap before you pour it. Heat it back up in the double boiler or place it in the microwave for a few more short bursts of heat to make it easier to pour."

Dip it again to add a second coating, then remove it from the liquid and let the second layer cool and harden. Continue dipping the soap in this manner until the soap has reached your desired thickness. Get creative with the material you use for your rope. Rather than dipping a straight length of rope into the glycerin, try tying it into a loop or a knot to create soap in different shapes.
