After determining what adjustments need to be made, you will need to consider the style of glasses you wear, as correcting the problem differs from plastic to wire frames. For wire frames, gently bend the arms with small pliers until they are straight. Put the glasses on and observe in the mirror to see if they are correct. Do not use wire cutters. You must use padded pliers or the frames will likely be damaged. For plastic frames, the plastic on the lower arm must be heated by a warm air source, such as a hair dryer, to make the plastic pliable. Slowly move the plastic upward with your hands until it is in the desired position. Be careful using the hair dryer as you could melt the plastic. Another way to bend plastic frames is to run them under hot water for 15 to 25 seconds before trying to make adjustments. The arm should become pliable enough to adjust, but be careful. The plastic can snap even when heated."
