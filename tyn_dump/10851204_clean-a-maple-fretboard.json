Removing the neck will prevent cleaners from getting trapped inside. If the neck is set, cover it with painter\u2019s tape or cloth to protect it. If you are cleaning an acoustic guitar fretboard, cover the soundhole. Cleaning the Fretboard Spread a thin layer of vegetable oil soap from the nut to the 22nd fret. Use about 1 cap of the vegetable oil soap. Start at the nut and spread it evenly to the 22nd fret. Shredders should spread it to the 24th fret. Spreading it with a cloth or paper towel will help to avoid using too much soap. Scrub in small, tight circles with the steel wool. Do this immediately after you put the soap on because vegetable oil soap can get sticky fast. Don\u2019t scrub directly with the grain because it can push the dirt further into the fretboard.

Use a clean, dry paper towel to wipe away the soap and remove as much of the residue as possible. Use additional paper towels as needed, rather than using the same towel over and over. Do not use water to remove the soap. Use a fretboard guard and steel wool to clean each fret\u2019s surface. The guards are easy to use. Just place the fretboard guard over a fret and lay it on top. The fret will slip through the slot. Scrub the surface of each fret with the steel wool to clean it. Remember to clean just the surface of the fret and not the board around the fret.

Restringing the Guitar Bend the ball-end of the string. Start with the thickest bass string. This small bend will help keep the string in place once it has been placed in the bridge hole. Push the ball through the 6E bridge hole and slide in the pin. You can use any bridge pin with any string. Make sure the string pin\u2019s notch is facing the guitar\u2019s neck, then push it securely in place. Do not exert unnecessary pressure on the pin. Insert the remaining strings at the bridge. Start with the thick bass strings and work your way to the thinner treble strings. Giving each string a gentle tug ensures that it is securely in place. It also tells you whether each ball is in the correct place at the bottom of the bridge pin. Pull the thickest string to its tuning peg and thread it. Pull it over the saddle and across the nut to its tuning peg. Thread the string through center of the tuning peg and pull it tight. Thread it from the inside to the outside. Wrap the string behind the tuning peg and secure. After you wrap it behind the peg, bring it under itself then over. It should sit securely around the peg now. Turn the string\u2019s tuning key counterclockwise. Only tighten it a little. Finish stringing the guitar before tightening the strings all the way. You'll tune your guitar once it\u2019s restrung. Trim the excess string close to the tuning peg. You can use wire cutters, or a specialty tool made for re-stringing guitars. Cutting the extra string close to the peg keeps sharp ends from snagging fabric and bags. String the rest of the guitar. As stated, work from the thickest string to the thinnest, making sure each string is securely in place before you trim it. If you need to start over, it will be easier to work with a string that hasn't been cut yet.",
