Being overly controlling through behavior modification can do lasting harm. Recognize that behavior can be communication. If you squash communication, then the child learns that they must suffer through their problems in silence. A child who acts out may be dealing with a serious problem. Always allow a child to reinforce personal boundaries. Children have the right to refuse hugs, kisses, eye contact, or any form of touch. If they are trained to comply whenever adults want to touch them, this makes it easy for pedophiles to take advantage of their compliance. Never deny a child access to items that meet physical or emotional needs. Children should be able to access food, water, restrooms, comfort items, and time to calm down when needed. Nor should they be physically restrained, or locked in \"calm down\" rooms against their will. Never do any form of punishment that causes pain or fear. For example, it is always unacceptable to hit a child or make them taste something disgusting as a punishment. Children should be allowed to be themselves. Quirky-but-harmless behavior (like fidgeting or lack of eye contact) should not be modified."
