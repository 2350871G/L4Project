This system collects information from the sensors in your engine. If the sensor detects something wrong, it reports it as an error code to the OBD-II. A scan tool allows you to read this code. The scan tool plugs into OBD-II data link connector, which is usually located under the dash. Locate the OBD-II data connector. The most common location for the OBD-II connector is under the dash by the steering wheel. The owner's manual should have the exact location if you have trouble finding it. Turn the ignition to the on position. Place your key in the ignition and turn it to on, but do not start the engine. You only want the electrical systems running. Connect the scan tool to the OBD-II data link connector. The scan tool will prompt you to fill in some information about your vehicle. It usually requires information about the make, model, engine, and year of the vehicle. Most scan tools draw power from the vehicle\u2019s battery and do not require a separate power source. Read the results. The scan tool will display any error codes the OBD-II reports. If the result is in the P0400 to PR409 range, then the EGR valve may be faulty.

Consult your owner\u2019s manual to find the exact location of the valve as it varies depending on the make and model of your vehicle. Once you have located the valve, look for an electrical connector on top of it. This connector will have the circuits you need to test. Clip the multimeter\u2019s read lead onto the \u201cC\u201d circuit. Each circuit on the EGR is labeled from \"A\" to \"E.\" Clip the multimeter's negative lead to a ground in the engine. The easiest and closest ground is the negative post on the vehicle\u2019s battery. Look the readings.

If the multimeter shows little or no voltage, then the EGR valve is most likely faulty. If the reading is between .6 and .9 Volts, then this means the EGR valve is working properly. Replacing The EGR Purchase the correct EGR valve for the make and model of your vehicle. Check with your owner\u2019s manual to find the right one. If you cannot find the correct EGR there, check a parts manual or with an associate at an auto parts stores. Let your engine cool. Wait for several hours before you begin working on your vehicle.

Use lubricant spray on the bolts because they are usually very tight. Take out the old EGR valve. Now that you removed the bolts, use your hands to remove the valve from its mount. Inspect the valve for signs of carbon buildup. Sometimes this buildup causes the valve to malfunction. If you find buildup, clean it off and reinstall the valve. Test the valve again to see if it works after cleaning it. Clean the valve base and passages. Use a scratch awl or something similar to remove any carbon buildup. Clean any debris or building in the gasket case. Use carburetor or intake cleaner to help remove the carbon. Install the new EGR valve. Thread the bolts through the EGR and gasket onto the mount with your hands first.
