            "description": "2006-2009 Priuses use D4R HID bulbs. The stock bulbs are made by Phillips and have a color temperature of 3400K. These can be found on eBay for $35 per bulb rather than the $150 charged by Toyota. Other brands can be found for $50 per pair. Other color temperatures are also available. The higher the color temperature, the more blue the lights will be (example: 8000K is much bluer than the stock 4300K (bright yellowish)).While it may be a good idea to replace both bulbs at the same time, if you choose not to do this, make sure to get the same color temperature bulb as the existing one or your headlights will appear different. In some places, it may be illegal to use higher kelvin (more blue or purple) bulbs. Some users note that the standard 4300K bulbs provide the best visible light for nighttime driving, and do not recommend going above 5000K."
