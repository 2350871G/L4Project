    "text": " Making a Traditional Pew Bow Gather your materials. Get a role of ribbon approximately six inches thick. You'll also need some scissors and invisible tape. Make the first loop. Take three yards (2.74 m) of your ribbon and make a loop by holding one end of the ribbon steady and folding the ribbon over on itself to create a loop. Hold the loop steady with the index finger and the thumb. Create the next loop. The next loop must be at an angle to the first loop, not lined up and on top of it. To do this, twist the remaining ribbon to the right and fold another loop in the ribbon. Make sure it's the same size of the first loop, and lies with its center lined up with the first loop's. Make sure to grab the second loop with the same index finger and thumb. Make the remaining loops. Continue making loops in the ribbon by twisting the remaining ribbon back and forth to the right and left while holding the center of each loop every time you form a loop. Make about 12 loops. Hold the 12 loops steady with one hand in the center. Take another strip of the shimmering sheer ribbon or wired ribbon that measures 12 inches (30 cm) and wrap it around the middle of the bow where all the loops meet. Tie the bow. Tie a knot or bow in the middle of the pew bow with the ribbon. Make sure it's tied tight enough to keep the loops steady. Allow the remaining ribbon to fall down the middle of the bow. Optionally add detail to the bow. Take the scissors, fold the end of each loop in half vertically, and cut a 3-inch (7.6 cm) line in the middle of the bow. Unfold the bow and you will notice an added detail on the ends of the bow. Improve the look of the loops. Adjust the loops of the ribbon by pulling on them and fanning them out with your hands. Pull some of the loops forward and some backward to give the bows even more dimension. Attach the bow. Use invisible tape to stick the pew bows on the pews. You can also use crafting wire to tie around the pew and keep the pew bows in place. Making a Tulle Pew Bow Gather your materials. You'll need some wired ribbon, some tulle, scissors, and twist ties. Cut the tails for the bow. Use your scissors to cut two to three feet lengths of both the wired ribbon and the tulle. Set these bow tails aside. Make the wired ribbon bow loops. Follow the loop making process to make 8 to 12 loops out of the wired ribbon. Make sure to hold the bow in the center while you do this, and try to keep the loops about the same length. Tie the ribbon bow. Wrap a twist tie around the center of the ribbon bow and twist it tight so that the bow keeps its shape. Attach the tail. Fold the length of ribbon to be used for a tail in half, and place the center against the center of the bow. Then undo the twist tie and redo it with the tail attached to the center of the bow. Make the tulle bow loops. Follow the loop making process to make 8 to 12 loops out of the tulle. Make sure to hold the bow in the center while you do this, and try to keep the loops about the same length. Make these loops larger than the loops on the wired ribbon bow. Tie the tulle bow. Wrap a twist tie around the center of the tulle bow and twist it tight so that the bow keeps its shape. Attach the tail. Fold the length of ribbon to be used for a tail in half, and place the center against the center of the bow. Then undo the twist tie and redo it with the tail attached to the center of the bow. Attach the two bows. Place the wired ribbon bow on top of the tulle bow and tie the two twist ties together so that the bows become one bow.",
