Quail eggs require a lot of attention if they're going to develop properly. The parents will need to keep the eggs very warm at all times. Unfortunately, it's common for quail to abandon their nest for periods of time, so their eggs don't thrive. It's best to use an incubator to hatch your eggs, as you'll get more healthy chicks.

Most breeds of quail hatch in 23-24 days, but Japanese quail usually hatch in 17-18 days. Using an Incubator to Hatch the Eggs Wash your hands frequently to avoid contaminating your eggs. If you're going to collect and handle the eggs, you need to have clean hands. Scrub your hands with a mild soap under warm, running water for at least 20 seconds. Then, rinse your hands clean. Dry them with a clean towel. Collect the eggs every day, as the hen will lay about 1 egg a day.

However, this may also damage the protective coating. In most cases, it\u2019s better to not hatch a dirty egg. Let the eggs rest for 3-7 days after collecting them. For the first 3 to 7 days after you collect the eggs, let them rest in a location with a temperature of 55 to 65 \u00b0F (13 to 18 \u00b0C). Letting them rest for a few days will help prepare them for incubation. Don\u2019t place fresh and stored eggs together. The longest you can safely leave the eggs to rest is 10 days, but it\u2019s better to place them in the incubator before a week has past. If the eggs sit for longer than a week, make sure you turn them at least once a day. Place the eggs in an incubator for up to 24 days. Set the incubator at a temperature between 99.5 to 100 \u00b0F (37.5 to 37.8 \u00b0C). Mist the eggs as needed to maintain a humidity level of about 58 percent. Leave the eggs in the incubator for 24 days or until they hatch. Attach a hygrometer to the incubator, which measures the humidity. You can find incubators that spray the eggs for you, or you can maintain the humidity by keeping a dish of water in the incubator. Keep the small end of the egg below the large end. The air pocket will be on the large end of the egg. It\u2019s important that the chick develop with its head toward the large end. If the large end is on the bottom, the chick may develop with its head on the wrong end, making it difficult for the chick to survive. Turn the eggs 90 degrees at least 3 times a day while they\u2019re incubating. Check on the eggs every 4 to 5 hours so you can turn them. Turn the egg often to ensure the chick develops properly. You can purchase an egg turner to turn them for you, if you like. Some incubators include an egg turner that does this automatically. Caring for the Chicks Expect the chicks to take 10 to 20 hours to fully hatch. After about 24 days of incubating, the chicks will start to hatch. Don\u2019t help them, as chicks who cannot hatch by themselves are unlikely to thrive. The chicks will rest frequently as they hatch, so expect it to take about 10 to 20 hours for them to fully hatch. Give eggs that don\u2019t hatch up to 1 day after their expected hatch day. At this point, you should throw out the eggs, as they\u2019re unlikely to hatch. If they do hatch, the chicks likely won\u2019t be healthy. Although most quail breeds take between 23-24 days to incubate, Japanese Quail usually take 17-18 days to hatch. If you're raising Japanese Quail, expect them to hatch sooner. Place hatched chicks in a small box, called a brooder. The brooder is where the chicks will spend their first few weeks safely. Fill the box with wood chips to keep them comfortable and safe. Never use paper or cardboard in the brooder, as the chicks can slip and hurt themselves. If you allowed your adult quail to incubate their own eggs, you can leave the chicks with them. However, they may not survive as well as they would in a brooder because their environment is harder to control. Heat the brooder to between 95 to 97 \u00b0F (35 to 36 \u00b0C) in the first 2 weeks. The chicks need to be kept warm so they can continue developing. As they grow, you can lower the temperature. Starting at week 3, lower the temperature by 5 degrees F (3 degrees C) every week until you reach a temperature of 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C). This will help the chicks grow healthily. Use a heat lamp to warm the brooder. Keep a 100-watt light on in the brooder for the first 3 days. Don\u2019t turn it off at all, even for nighttime. The chicks need the light to help them find feed and water, as their eyes aren\u2019t well developed. It will also help keep them from pecking at each other. After the first 3 days, you can switch to a dimmer light. However, keep the light on as much as possible to discourage the chicks from pecking at each other. Give the chicks starter feed and water. Provide a constant supply of starter feed and fresh water. The chicks will graze throughout the day. Check on the feed twice a day to remove soiled food and refill the feeder. Dump and replace the water twice a day, as well. Choose a very shallow dish for water so that the chicks don\u2019t drown.",

        "However, you will likely have more live chicks if you breed the male with 2 or 3 females.",
        "If you want to eat the eggs, don't put a male into the cage.",
        "Female quail will lay eggs whether or not the male is present.",
        "However, they must mate with a male to produce fertile eggs that will have chicks.",
        "You can keep as many as 5 females together at one time.",
        "Provide your quail with 14 to 16 hours of light daily.",
        "Sunlight is best for your quail, but you can also use an artificial UV lamp.",
        "This encourages the quail to breed because they typically mate during spring and summer when the days are long.",

        "If you're using an incubator, you want to incubate the eggs on your schedule.",
        "If the eggs start and stop incubating, the chick likely won't develop properly.",
        "If the egg hatches at all, the chick will likely be unhealthy.",
        "Throw out eggs that are cracked, misshapen, or very large or small.",
        "These eggs will not produce healthy chicks, if they hatch at all.",
        "Very large eggs often hatch unhealthy chicks, while small eggs typically produce tiny chicks that won\u2019t thrive.",
        "It\u2019s best to remove the eggs and throw them in your garbage.",
