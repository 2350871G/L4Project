        "Fine-Grained Shimmer with Gum-Tex or Tylose Powder Preheat the oven to 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.",
        "You can also use a silicone baking mat if you have one, but do not use plastic wrap since it\u2019s not oven safe.",
        "Measure out 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of gum-Tex or tylose powder.",
        "Gum-Tex and tylose powder are fine white powders used to strengthen fondants and gum pastes.",
        "You can purchase them at bakery specialty stores, craft shops, or online.",
        "Mix the powder with luster dust food coloring powder in a small bowl.",
        "Start with about \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of luster dust food coloring and slowly add more until you achieve your desired intensity of color.",
        "You can also use airbrush food coloring instead of luster dust if you have it available.",
        "Stir 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of boiling water into the ingredients in the bowl.",
        "The mixture will get chunky, so try to smooth out as many clumps as you can.",
        "Mix until all the water is incorporated.",
        "Eventually, the gum-tex or tylose will thicken the water into a paste-like texture.",
        "Try adding the water 1 tablespoon (15 mL) at a time to help minimize clumpiness.",
        "Spread the mixture onto the lined baking tray.",
        "The thinner you spread the gum mixture, the quicker it will bake, but be careful to make an even layer so everything cooks at the same rate.",
        "A pastry or food brush can help.",
        "Bake the gum mixture in the oven until it is fully dry.",
        "The exact timing will depend on how thick you spread the glitter, but should be around 30 minutes.",
        "Once it\u2019s done, the mixture should be fully hardened and will peel away from the tray.",
        "Let the glitter cool and break it into smaller pieces.",
        "Once the glitter has fully cooled, use your hands or a pair of scissors to break the large sheet into pieces small enough to fit into your coffee grinder or food processor.",
        "Use a coffee grinder or food processor to further crumble the glitter.",
        "Place the larger pieces of glitter into the bowl of the grinder or processor.",
        "Put on the lid and grind until your glitter has fine grains.",
        "Try using the spice grinder attachment for your coffee grinder if you have one.",
        "Pour your glitter through a sieve to separate out larger pieces.",
        "Re-grind these larger pieces for a more uniformly fine-grained glitter.",
        "However, if you're okay with more variety in glitter sizes, you can skip this step altogether.",
        "Store the edible glitter in an airtight container or jar.",
        "Your edible glitter should last for months, but may lose some sparkle over time.",
        "Be sure to store it away from water and sunlight to prolong its shelf life.",
        "Richly Colored Sparkles with Gum Arabic Preheat the oven to 280 \u00b0F (138 \u00b0C) and line a baking tray.",
        "You can use parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to line your tray, but skip plastic wrap since it's not oven-safe.",
        "Measure \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of gum arabic into a small bowl.",
        "Gum arabic is a thickening agent used frequently in icings and fillings when baking.",
        "It has the properties of a glue or binder and can be found at bakery specialty stores, well-stocked craft shops, and online.",
        "Mix in hot water and a few drops of airbrush food coloring.",
        "Start with \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of hot water and add more a drop at a time if needed.",
        "Gum arabic picks up color well, so add your color in slowly: a little will go a long way.",
        "Whisk until the color and water are fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.",
        "Don\u2019t have airbrush food color?",
        "You can use luster dust instead.",
        "Start with \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) and add more if needed.",
        "Spread the mixture onto the lined baking sheet with a small brush.",
        "The mixture will not be a solid sheet, but try to spread it evenly over the tray to ensure even baking times.",
        "Bake the glitter for 10 minutes.",
        "When it\u2019s fully baked, the glitter should be dry and will start to peel away from the baking tray.",
        "Let the glitter cool and break the pieces apart.",
        "Once everything has fully cooled, use a wooden spoon or simply your hands to create smaller pieces of glitter.",
        "For a finer grain, you can run the glitter through a mesh sieve or tea strainer.",
        "Store the edible glitter in an airtight container or jar.",
        "Your edible glitter should last for months, but may lose some sparkle over time.",
        "Be sure to keep away from water and sunlight to prolong its shelf life.",
        "Extra Shiny Gelatin-Based Glitter Measure 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of unflavored gelatin powder into a small bowl.",
        "Avoid flavored gelatin powder, which is usually colored.",
        "This can mix unfavorably with your dye and dampen the sparkle needed to create glitter.",
        "Mix in 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of water.",
        "Using a spoon or small spatula, stir well the mixture until it thickens up.",
        "This could take up to 5 minutes.",
        "If any white foam appears, skim off with a spoon and discard.",
        "Add luster dust or airbrush food color.",
        "Start with a small amount (roughly \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 mL)) and mix in more until you achieve the color you want.",
        "For an extra shiny glitter, look for airbrush food coloring with a pearl sheen.",
        "For a more intense hue, add a few drops of gel paste food coloring in a matching shade.",
        "Pour the gelatin mixture onto a large sheet of plastic or acetate.",
        "A plastic cutting board or baking sheet lined with plastic wrap would also work perfectly.",
        "Aim to pour the gelatin onto the center of the plastic so it doesn\u2019t spill off the sides.",
        "If the mixture doesn\u2019t naturally spread across the plastic, use an offset spatula to even it out.",
        "Allow the glitter solidify overnight.",
        "If you\u2019re in a hurry, you can speed things along by placing it in front of a dehumidifier or fan on a low setting.",
        "Once the gelatin is fully dried, it will curl up and peel away from the plastic sheet.",
        "Use a coffee grinder or food processor to break up the glitter.",
        "You may need to break up the sheet into smaller pieces so that it fits in the bowl of the grinder or processor.",
        "Put on the lid and grind until your glitter has fine grains.",
        "Try using the spice grinder attachment for your coffee grinder if you have one.",
        "Sift your glitter through a sieve to separate out larger pieces.",
        "Re-grind these larger pieces for a more uniformly fine-grained glitter.",
        "However, if you're okay with more variety in glitter sizes, you can skip this step altogether.",
        "Store in an airtight container or jar.",
        "Your edible glitter should last for months, but may lose some sparkle over time.",
