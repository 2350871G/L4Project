Place 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar into a small, fine mesh sieve. Dust enough of the powdered sugar to completely coat the pan. Tap out the powdered sugar that doesn't stick to the oil. You won't need to use all of the powdered sugar. Just set the sieve aside since you'll need to dust more powdered sugar later. You could also spray the pan with cooking spray instead of spreading it with vegetable oil."
