        "Make sure to place the cookies so they are 1-inch apart to prevent them spreading into one another during baking.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a non-stick baking sheet, line yours with a baking mat or parchment paper to make it easier to get the cookies off once they\u2019ve baked.",
        "Baking the Cookies Bake the cookies for 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Place the cookie sheet in the oven and allow them to bake until the edges are set and crisp.",
        "That usually takes between 10 and 15 minutes, depending on the thickness that you rolled the dough to and the size of cookie cutters that you used.",
        "The cookies should be firm but still soft when they\u2019re baked through.",
        "Remove from the oven and cool on sheets.",
        "Once the cookies are done, remove the baking sheet from the oven.",
        "Allow the cookies to cool on the sheets for 1 to 2 minutes to ensure that they\u2019re fully set before you move them.",
        "Cool completely on wire racks.",
        "After cooling the cookies for a couple of minutes on the baking sheet, use a spatula to transfer them to wire racks.",
        "Allow the cookies to cool completely, which should take approximately 20 to 30 minutes.",
        "If you plan on decorating your cookies, it\u2019s especially important to allow them to cool fully.",
        "Otherwise, the royal icing may melt when you apply it to the cookies.",
        "Making the Royal Icing Combine the powdered sugar, milk, and egg whites.",
        "In a large bowl, mix 2 pounds (970 g) of sifted powdered sugar, \u2153 cup (80 mL) of whole milk, and 2 large egg whites.",
        "Use an electric mixer on low to beat them together until they form a thick icing that\u2019s you\u2019re still able to pipe with a pastry bag.",
        "You may need to add a little extra milk to the icing to make it thin enough for piping.",
        "Add a couple of drops at a time and stir, so you don\u2019t accidentally make it too thin.",
        "You can refrigerate the icing for up to two days if you store it in an airtight container.",
        "You may want to make it ahead of time, so it\u2019s ready when it\u2019s time to decorate the cookies.",
        "If you\u2019re short on time, you can substitute canned vanilla frosting from the grocery store for the royal icing.",
        "Add food coloring if desired.",
        "Royal icing is naturally white, but depending on how you plan to decorate your cookies, you may want to color it.",
        "Use food coloring drops or paste to color the icing before putting it in a piping bag.",
        "When you add the food coloring, start gradually so you don\u2019t make the icing too dark.",
        "You may want to divide the icing, and color it in multiple shades to fit the occasion.",
        "Put the icing into a piping/pastry bag.",
        "Once the icing is the right consistency, place it in a piping or pastry bag.",
        "Make sure that the bag has a fine tip attached to make decorating easier.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a piping or pastry bag, you can use a squirt bottle to dispense the icing on the cookies.",
        "Decorating the Cookies Pipe some lines on cookies with icing.",
        "Once your pastry bag is ready, you can pipe the icing on as an accent for the cookies.",
        "You can use it simply to outline the shape of the cookie, or to add fine details, such as a face for a gingerbread man cookie.",
        "You can also use the icing to pipe patterns on the cookies, such as an all-over polka dot or stripe design.",
        "Use icing to serve as glue for candies.",
        "Royal icing works extremely well as a glue to hold decorative candies and other embellishments on the cookies.",
        "Just add a dot of the frosting onto the cookie where you want to place the decoration and press the candy into place.",
        "When the icing dries, it won\u2019t move.",
        "You can use candies specifically meant for cookies decorating, such as sugar pearls or dragees, or you can use regular candies, such as M&M\u2019s.",
        "Allow the icing to dry completely before you place the decorated cookies in storage containers.",
        "Spread icing across the entire surface.",
        "If you want an easy way to decorate the cookies, use a knife to spread the icing over the entire cookie.",
        "While the icing is still wet, sprinkle colored sugar over it for a colorful, sparkling look.",
        "You can use a single colored sugar for the entire cookie, or use a piece of paper towel or a paper plate to block off sections of the cookie as you sprinkle to use multiple colors for a striped effect."
