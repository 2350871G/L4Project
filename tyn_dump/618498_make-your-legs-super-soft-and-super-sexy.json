If your shaving cream isn\u2019t doing both of those things, try a different kind. If you like being more natural or adventurous, there are alternatives to shaving cream. You can also use conditioner, baby oil, sweet almond oil, and cocoa butter or a similar moisturizing lotion. Just make sure that whatever you use is sufficiently thick and moisturizing. For example, coconut oil is often touted as a skin oil, but it might be too light to prevent razor burn if you use it while shaving."

They\u2019re great because they work out most or all of your major leg muscles and they can be easily customized to target specific areas. You can search for exercises that work a particular area, or you can just look for leg toning exercises and test them out to see where you feel your legs working the most. For example, to give your inner thighs an extra workout, you can squeeze a medicine ball between your legs while squatting. Or to work your calves, you can bring your heels together with toes facing slightly outward, rise up on the balls of your feet, and go into a half squat. Even if you hate squats and lunges, there are other options. For example, bridge position is a good workout for your thighs and butt. Lie on your back on the floor with your hands down by your sides. Bring your knees up and place your feet flat on the floor. Keeping your arms flat for support, use your abs and glutes to slowly peel your butt and lower back off the floor, raising them until your torso creates a straight diagonal line. Hold for a few moments, then slowly lower back down with control. Repeat two more times. You can also make this a little more intense. From the raised position, lift your right leg straight up in the air with your foot flexed. Pulse up and down 10-15 times in this position, then lower your foot and slowly lower down. Repeat on the other side. You can also do this from crab position if you want to get a little arm toning in too, but make sure you pulse from your knee and elbows instead of your waist."
