Get a heat cable that matches the length of your hose and secure the sensor with electrical tape so it's pressed against the hose. Run the cable parallel with the hose and wrap electrical tape around it every 1 foot (30 cm) so it stays in place. You can buy heat cables from hardware stores or specialty camping stores. Use heat cables whenever you stay in an area that is colder than 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C). Most RV sites in colder climates already have insulation around the supply lines. If the water supply line at your campsite doesn't already have insulation, you may need to wrap heat cable around it as well.Warning: Avoid coiling the heat cable around the hose since it could make areas too hot and cause damage to the hose."
