Aging Brass with Saltwater and Ammonia Take off any parts not made of brass. Disassemble the hardware and remove the brass pieces. This method should only be applied to brass hardware; using it on materials made of plastic or glass may leave those pieces discolored. Remove any dust or dirt from the brass. Use a clean, dry rag to remove any dust or foreign materials from the hardware. If your hardware is new or uninstalled, you might be able to skip this step.

After the salt has dissolved, use the hook end of your lid-hook configuration to dip your brass hardware into the liquid and hold it there for 30 seconds. Pour 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of household ammonia into a metal coffee can. Avoid overdoing it on the ammonia; you only need to pour enough in the coffee can to produce fumes and don\u2019t want it to actually be touching the brass hardware.

Apply heat to the can's bottom area with a hair dryer for 2 minutes. This will release ammonia fumes onto the brass hardware and age it. Remove the lid from the can after 2 minutes of heat application and rinse. Be sure you don\u2019t inhale the ammonia fumes when you remove the lid, as it will burn and may cause lung damage.

        "Pour enough ager into the container so that you can fully submerge your brass hardware in the liquid.",
        "You can also use a plastic container to hold the ager.",
        "Brass ager is a type of antiquing solution specifically used for brass.",
        "You can typically find brass ager at any department store and some online retailers.",
        "Be sure to wear protective gloves when handling or working with brass ager.",
        "Dip the brass hardware in the ager for at least 30 seconds.",
        "Use latex or rubber gloves and submerge the hardware completely in the ager.",
        "Leave it submerged for at least 30 seconds before removing it.",
        "You can leave the hardware in the brass ager for longer than 30 seconds if you want to achieve a darker, more aged look.",
        "However, don\u2019t leave your hardware in the brass ager for more than 10 minutes.",
        "Rub the brass piece with steel wool to remove unwanted discoloration.",
        "The brass ager will significantly age and darken whatever hardware you\u2019ve submerged in it.",
        "Use steel wool to remove this discoloration on parts of the hardware where you would normally see wear.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re aging a brass doorknob, you may want the places where people\u2019s fingers normally touch the knob to have more of a worn look instead of an aged look.",
        "Dip the hardware in cold water and then dry it with a soft rag.",
        "Dipping the brass hardware in cold water will stop the aging process.",
        "After it\u2019s dried, it\u2019s ready to be reattached.",
        "Be careful not to use an abrasive scrubbing cloth, as this might damage the brass.",
        "Polish the hardware and repeat this process if you don\u2019t like it.",
        "If you don\u2019t like how the aging turned out, it\u2019s no problem!",
        "Simply polish the hardware completely and start the process over from the beginning.",
        "To polish the brass, simply use brass cleaner and a microfiber cloth.",
        "Put the hardware back together then reinstall it.",
        "Once the brass hardware has been cleaned and dried and you\u2019re satisfied with how the aging turned out, reattach the brass to the fixture or area you originally removed it from.",
        "Aging Brass with Saltwater and Ammonia Take off any parts not made of brass.",
        "Disassemble the hardware and remove the brass pieces.",
        "This method should only be applied to brass hardware; using it on materials made of plastic or glass may leave those pieces discolored.",
        "Remove any dust or dirt from the brass.",
        "Use a clean, dry rag to remove any dust or foreign materials from the hardware.",
        "If your hardware is new or uninstalled, you might be able to skip this step.",
        "Whether you need to clean your hardware and how you should go about it will ultimately depend on how dirty it is.",
        "Use soapy water and a washcloth if your hardware is particularly dirty.",
        "If it\u2019s only a little dusty, just using a dry rag should suffice.",
        "Be careful not to use an abrasive scrubbing cloth, as this might damage the brass.",
        "Punch a hole through the center of a coffee can lid.",
        "Use a hammer and nail to punch a small hole in the center of the coffee can lid that is big enough for the coat hanger wire to pass through.",
        "Run the hanger wire through the hole and secure it to the lid.",
        "Once you\u2019ve made a hole in the coffee can lid, poke your hanger\u2019s unhooked end through the hole and bend it into a right angle so it can hold itself in place.",
        "Once the wire hanger is secured to the lid, make sure it\u2019s able to hold the weight of your brass hardware before you actually use it.",
        "Hook your hardware onto the wire and hold the lid up to make sure the wire doesn\u2019t fall through the hole in the lid.",
        "Mix saltwater in a plastic bucket and dip your brass piece in the liquid.",
        "Combine 1 cup (240 mL) of water and 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of salt in a clean plastic bucket.",
        "After the salt has dissolved, use the hook end of your lid-hook configuration to dip your brass hardware into the liquid and hold it there for 30 seconds.",
        "Pour 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of household ammonia into a metal coffee can.",
        "Avoid overdoing it on the ammonia; you only need to pour enough in the coffee can to produce fumes and don\u2019t want it to actually be touching the brass hardware.",
        "Note that the coffee can you use needs to be metallic; cans made of plastic or other materials can\u2019t be used to safely hold and heat ammonia.",
        "You can buy household ammonia at most mass retailers and certain grocery stores.",
        "Use your lid-hook configuration to hang the hardware piece in the can.",
        "Replace the lid on the coffee can so the hardware piece dangles inside the can.",
        "Make sure that the brass piece doesn\u2019t touch the ammonia during this process.",
        "Apply heat to the can's bottom area with a hair dryer for 2 minutes.",
        "This will release ammonia fumes onto the brass hardware and age it.",
        "Remove the lid from the can after 2 minutes of heat application and rinse.",
        "Be sure you don\u2019t inhale the ammonia fumes when you remove the lid, as it will burn and may cause lung damage.",
        "After you\u2019re safely removed the lid, take the hardware off the wire hook and rinse it thoroughly with cold water.",
        "Repeat as necessary.",
        "If you\u2019re not happy with your results, repeat the process to further age the brass hardware.",
        "Simply re-dip it in the salt solution, place the lid-hook configuration back on the coffee can, and apply heat for another 2 minutes.",
        "Reattach the hardware when you're done.",
        "Once the brass hardware has been cleaned and dried and you\u2019re satisfied with how the aging turned out, reattach the brass to the fixture or area you originally removed it from."
