        "A ceiling fan or box fan will work best.",
        "Buffing Your Floor by Hand Start in the far corner of the room.",
        "Then, work your way backward toward the entrance to the room.",
        "Don't pass back over areas you've already buffed, as they need time to dry.",
        "Work in 3 ft (0.91 m) by 3 ft (0.91 m) sections until you finish buffing.",
        "Focusing on small sections will help you achieve better results.",
        "Plus, it will keep you from getting overwhelmed during the process.",
        "If you don't like the results of your first few sections, you might decide to stop hand buffing the floor and switch to a machine.",
        "Some floors won't show much improvement from hand buffing.",
        "Depending on the size of your room, it can take a while to finish buffing.",
        "It's a good idea to take regular breaks, if necessary.",
        "Spray a buffing solution onto your floor for extra shine.",
        "When you're buffing by hand, spray the solution onto just the area where you're working so the solution won't be dry by the time you get across the room.",
        "It's best to use a bottle with a spray nozzle to evenly distribute the solution.",
        "If your solution doesn't have a spray nozzle, use a clean cloth to wipe it onto the floor.",
        "Make sure you choose a buffing solution that's formulated for your type of flooring material.",
        "If you prefer a natural option, create a white vinegar solution by adding 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.",
        "Put the solution into a spray bottle, then spritz it onto your floor.",
        "Use a microfiber cloth to buff the floor using tight, circular motions.",
        "Move your cloth slowly from side to side as you work each section.",
        "When you complete each pass, start the next one with some overlap with the previous pass.",
        "As you buff, apply as much pressure to the cloth as you can.",
        "The microfiber cloth shouldn't damage your floor, no matter what material it is.",
        "Keep in mind that buffing a floor typically requires a lot of pressure, so you may not see much difference if you don't press down very hard.",
        "Using a Spray Buffer Spray the buffing solution onto your floor, if you\u2019re using it.",
        "For best results, use a professional sprayer or a product that comes with a spray nozzle.",
        "Start in the far corner of the room and work your way toward the other side.",
        "Aim the spray 2\u20134 ft (61\u2013122 cm) in front of the buffer in an area that\u2019s about 6\u20138 in (15\u201320 cm) wide.",
        "Use a buffing solution formulated for the type of floor material you have, such as wood, tile, or vinyl.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a sprayer, you can use a mop to apply the solution.",
        "However, it won\u2019t be as effective at distributing it.",
        "You can buy or rent a sprayer from most home improvement stores.",
        "Additionally, some buffing solutions come in a spray bottle.",
        "Attach a red buffing pad if you're spray buffing your floor.",
        "This pad is intended for use on a wet floor, so it will soak up some of the buffing solution.",
        "Follow the instructions for your buffer to attach it correctly.",
        "Be sure to read all of the instructions that come with your buffer.",
        "It\u2019s best to have an extra pad handy if you\u2019re going to be buffing a large surface area.",
        "Although you\u2019ll be able to use both sides of the pad, it can get clogged up or dirty as you work.",
        "If you\u2019re spray buffing your floor, you\u2019ll need both a red pad and a gray or beige pad, for best results.",
        "Your floor will look better if you do a dry buffing after your spray buffing.",
        "Work in 3 ft (0.91 m) by 3 ft (0.91 m) sections.",
        "Start in the far corner of the room and work your way back toward the entrance.",
        "As you buff the floor, mentally separate it into small sections to make it easier to buff the entire surface area of the floor.",
        "Overlap your passes to ensure every bit of flooring gets buffed.",
        "Rotate your machine back and forth as you move across each section.",
        "Although the buffer is doing most of the work for you, rotating it will help you achieve a better result.",
        "Not only does it ensure the buffer covers all of the surface area, but it will also help you really work areas where there are scratches or scuffs.",
        "Your motion should swing back and forth like a pendulum.",
        "Move backward as you work so you don\u2019t step on the buffed sections.",
        "This helps you avoid stepping on the parts of the floor you\u2019ve already buffed.",
        "You don\u2019t want to step on the buffed areas because they will be very slippery.",
        "Also, you don\u2019t want to mess up the finish.",
        "Walk slowly so you don\u2019t accidentally trip over your own feet.",
        "Hold the buffer over scratches and scuffs for a few extra seconds.",
        "As you work, look for visible scratches and buffs.",
        "It\u2019s okay to give these areas special attention by holding the buffer over them for a few extra seconds.",
        "Additionally, you can make several passes over them.",
        "If you still notice a scratch or scuff after you finish, you can try hand rubbing it with a soft cloth soaked in buffing solution.",
        "Flip or change the buffing pad if it gets clogged or dirty.",
        "Stop and check the buffing pad every few minutes to see if it looks dirty or clogged.",
        "Additionally, you\u2019ll know the pad needs to be changed if the floor isn\u2019t getting as shiny as it was previously.",
        "Most buffing pads can be flipped once during cleaning.",
        "If your pad looks soaked through, just switch to a new one.",
        "Follow spray buffing with a pass of dry buffing, for best results.",
        "Switch out your red buffing pad for a gray or beige one.",
        "Then, start buffing your floor in the far corner.",
        "Slowly work your way toward the other side of the room.",
        "Your buffing pad likely won\u2019t need changing on this pass.",
        "However, continue to check on it regularly to make sure it\u2019s not clogged or dirty.",
        "It\u2019s best to wait until your floor is dry before you start your dry buffing.",
        "You may want to apply a finish to the floor to reduce slipperiness and increase the shine.",
        "Use a clean dust mop to remove any dust created by the buffing process.",
        "Once your floor is dry, return to the corner of the room and begin making short, even passes with your dust mop.",
        "Continue working your way over the entire surface of the floor until you reach the other side of the room.",
        "This helps get your floor as clean and shiny as possible.",
        "Using a floor buffer can stir dust up into the air, which will then fall back down onto your freshly buffed floor.",
        "A clean dust mop can remove this debris."
