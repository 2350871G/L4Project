Gently push the lens forward so the lens slides out from the frame. Pop out the other lens the same way.Tip: Put a microfiber cloth between your thumb and the lenses so you don\u2019t get fingerprints on them. Heating Plastic Frames in Water Fill a shallow bowl with hot water from your sink. Use the hottest water you can handle from your sink for soaking your frames. Fill a bowl that's deep enough to completely submerge your frames so they can heat evenly. Place a towel under your bowl to help prevent spills and to protect your lenses if you drop them. Set the glasses in the bowl so the lenses are face down. Either fold up the arms of your glasses or remove the screws holding them in. Set the glasses in the water so the concave sides of the lenses are face-up. Leave the frames in the water for 1 minute to heat the plastic and make it easier to bend. Dry the lenses off with a microfiber cloth after 1 minute. Take the glasses out of the water and shake off any excess liquid. Use a dry microfiber towel to wipe any water droplets off the lenses and frames so they don\u2019t slip around. Cover both sides of the lenses with the microfiber cloth to get a better grip of them.Warning: Don\u2019t use a paper towel to dry your glasses or lenses since the towel could leave scratches. Push gently on the concave side of the lenses to pop them out of place. Grip the nose bridge with your nondominant hand and place your dominant thumb on the concave side of the lens. Carefully push the corner of the lens until it pops out of place and comes out of the frame. Remove 1 lens completely before you remove the other so you don\u2019t accidentally drop them. If the lenses don\u2019t come out right away, then try putting the frames in hot water again for another minute. Using a Hair Dryer on Plastic Frames Heat the frames around your lenses on the medium setting for 5 minutes. Hold the hair dryer about 6 inches (15 cm) from your glasses frames. Turn your hair dryer onto a medium heat and speed setting to warm up the plastic. Move the dryer around the frames near the lenses so they\u2019re more flexible and you\u2019re able to remove the lenses. Don\u2019t use a high heat setting since you may melt or deform your frames.
