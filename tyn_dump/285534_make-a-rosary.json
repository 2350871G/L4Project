    "text": " Starting the Rosary Pick out supplies. A rosary is composed of a crucifix, 53 beads of one color to represent Hail Mary prayers, and 6 beads of another color to represent Our Father prayers. The crucifix and beads are strung in a pattern on sturdy string or thread. Religious supply stores sell small crucifixes that are suitable for making rosaries. They also commonly sell beads you can use to represent the Hail Mary and Our Father prayers. Waxed nylon cord is commonly used for making rosaries. Be sure to pick out cord that fits through the centers of the beads you have chosen. The beads should fit the cord easily, but they should not be loose. You'll need about 3 feet (1 meter). Sort the beads. Rosaries are divided into five \"decades,\" sections that contain ten beads each, as well as a smaller section with three more beads. Divide the Hail Mary beads into five groups of ten and one group of three. Place the Our Father beads in a separate pile. Prepare the cord. Use a ruler and an ink pen to mark the cord with a dot about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the end. Tie a knot over the dot to begin the rosary. The knot should be large enough to prevent beads from slipping over it to the other side of the cord. Stringing the Rosary String 10 Hail Mary beads on the long end of the cord. Make sure they stack up on the long end of the knot, and that there's no chance they'll be able to slip over to the other side. Tie a second knot at the end of the string of beads. Leave a little space for the beads to slide, but not too much. When the rosary is used, the person using it should be able to slide the beads down slightly once each prayer is complete. If you need help tying a knot in a certain place, try this trick: make a loose knot over the spot where you want to tighten it. Place a toothpick on the cord in the spot where the knot should go, then pull it tight and remove the toothpick. String an Our Father bead after the second knot. This bead should be a different color from the ten Hail Mary beads you have already strung. Tie another knot directly after the Our Father bead. Continue stringing 4 more decades. After tying a knot after the first Our Father bead, string 10 more Hail Mary beads. Tie a knot, string an our Father bead, tie another knot, and string 10 more Hail Mary beads. Continue until you've strung all 5 decades with the exception of the final Our Father bead. Finish with a knot after the last set of 10 Hail Mary beads. Finishing the Rosary Tie the ends together. Form a circle of beads by tying the two ends together after the first and last knot. You now have a circle of five decades with two string tails hanging loose. If your beads are large enough to slip over both tails, you may keep both strings intact. If your beads are too small to slip over both tails, trim the shorter tail with a pair of scissors. Use a dab of clear nail polish or glue to keep the last knot secure as you continue. String the last Our Father bead. Tie a knot directly after it. String the last three Hail Mary beads. Tie another knot to keep these beads in place. Add the crucifix. Secure it tightly by adding a double knot after you've strung it on the rosary. Use more clear nail polish or adhesive to make sure the knot stays in place. Clip the loose thread hanging off the knot. Have the rosary blessed. It is customary to have a priest bless the rosary before you use it to pray. Take the rosary to your parish and ask the priest to say a blessing, then use the rosary or give it away.",
