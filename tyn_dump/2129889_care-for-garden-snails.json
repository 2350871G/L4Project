Only baby snails or the smallest adult varieties can be kept long term in a plastic container. Most require a larger tank to stay clean and healthy. You can purchase a terrarium at a pet store made for this purpose. Use a 5 gallon (19 L) tank or larger so the snail has room to move around. If you have several snails or intend to take care of young snails if the adult ones reproduce, get a larger tank."

Never use rocks in your terrarium as snails could fall off the sides of the glass and break their shell. Bark and sticks usually fall apart after a few weeks, so you will need to replace them.
