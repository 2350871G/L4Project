This will ensure the area is clear and safe for cutting. Small chunks of asphalt or rocks that the blade of your saw runs into could fly up dangerously to the side or back at you and cause injury, so it\u2019s important to make sure the area is totally clear. A circular saw equipped with a diamond blade is ideal for making long straight cuts in asphalt."

                    "description": "Use a chalk line to make long straight lines, such as for the entire length of an asphalt driveway. Use a piece of chalk and a straight edge if you want to make shorter lines, such as around a piece of damaged asphalt that you want to cut out. A chalk line is a retractable string line covered in chalk that you stretch out in a straight line just above the ground, then lift up and let it snap back down against the ground to leave a chalk line."

Make sure your circular saw is powered off and unplugged, then use a wrench to loosen the nut that holds the blade in place and swap it out for a diamond blade. You can get a diamond blade at a home improvement center or power tool supply shop.

For anything deeper, you can use the same process with a walk-behind circular saw. You can rent these types of saws at power tool supply stores.
