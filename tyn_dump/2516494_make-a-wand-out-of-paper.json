    "text": " Making a Harry Potter Wand Lay a strip of double-sided tape diagonally across a sheet of paper. The tape needs to go from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. If you need to, cut the tape into smaller pieces first so that it is easier to work with. Regular 8\u00bd by 11-inch (21.59 by 27.94-centimeter) paper will work the best for this. Roll the paper into a tight, tapering tube. Begin rolling the paper from the bottom right corner, and finish rolling at the top left corner. When you reach the taped part, simply roll right over it. Try to roll the paper so that one end is slightly wider than the other. The wider end will be the bottom of your wand. Plan on having one end come to a sharp point and the other end to a \u00bc to \u00bd-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) opening. Glue the end of the paper down. Coat the inside of top left corner with liquid glue. Smooth it back down onto the wand. Secure it with a piece of tape or a clip until the glue dries. Once the glue dries, remove the tape or clip. You can also secure the corner with a piece of double-sided tape instead of gluing it. Trim both ends of the wand to make them straight. You can do this with a sharp pair of scissors. If the ends get crushed, you can fill them back out with a skinny skewer or knitting needle. Fill the holes in with hot glue. Squeeze some hot glue into the tip of your wand.
