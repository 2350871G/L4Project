The pinecones can be any shape or size, but tall pinecones will look more like Christmas trees than short ones. How many pinecones you get depends on how many trees you want to make. You will need 1 pinecone for each tree that you will be making. Pinecones sold in stores are typically scented. Be aware of this if you have allergies."
