        "Make sure the weatherstripping on the hinge plate faces the inside of the door so it makes a tight seal.",
        "Use an electric screwdriver and the provided screws to attach the hinges along the side of the door.",
        "Sometimes, the storm door will have a screw already in it or have predrilled holes so you can line up the hinge plate easier.Tip: If it\u2019s difficult to attach the screws, try drilling into the door with a bit that\u2019s slightly smaller than the screws.",
        "For example, if the screws have a diameter of \u20444 inch (0.64 cm), then drill a hole that\u2019s \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) wide.",

        "Screw the top piece in place using the guide holes and the screws provided with the storm door.",
        "The top piece guides water away from the door so it doesn\u2019t drip inside or cause any internal damage.",
        "If there\u2019s more than a 1 in (2.5 cm) gap between the top of your door frame and the top of your storm door, then you need to screw a header board into the top of the frame to close the gap.",

        "Test closing the door to see if there is a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) gap between it and the side piece.",
        "If not, then readjust the frame piece or add shims to close the gap.",

        "Close your door to make sure the sweep extends completely down to the threshold so it forms a tight seal.",

        "Position the closer mount on the side of the door frame and screw it in.",
        "Find the mounts for the pneumatic closer and find the one labeled \u201cFrame.\u201d Hold the mount against your door frame where you want to install the closer, and mark where the holes are so you know where to drill.",
        "Use a drill bit that\u2019s \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) smaller than your screws for the holes.",

        "Pull the rod out about \u20442\u2013\u20444 inch (1.3\u20131.9 cm) so it has a slight amount of tension and secure it in place with the square metal tab.",
        "Attach the other mount to the tube with the locking pin and hold it against your storm door.",
