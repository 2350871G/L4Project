Don't put unripe plums in the refrigerator. They won't be able to continue the ripening process in the cold climate, and you'll end up with chill-damaged plums, which are tasteless and mealy. If you aren't in a hurry for the plums to ripen, you can put them in a bowl on the counter instead of in a paper bag. They'll take an extra day or so to ripen."
