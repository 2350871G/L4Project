        "Put your overlay in place over the template.",
        "Once you\u2019ve created an outline for your template, add your overlay stencil.",
        "You may wish to tape or pin it to the edges of your work surface.",
        "Did you know?",
        "Some complex stencil designs involve using 2 or more overlays that work together to create a single image.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re making a tree design, you might have one overlay for the branch elements, another for the leaves, and a third one for flowers.",
        "The overlay will create an interesting background for the negative template image.",
        "Use your airbrush to fill in the area around the template.",
        "With your overlay and template in place, sweep your airbrush across the work surface with a back-and-forth motion.",
        "Fill in as much of the surface as you like, but focus on the borders of your template.",
        "The larger the area you cover with your paint, the more of the overlay design will be visible in your final piece.",

        "Use a negative stencil to add more decorations.",
        "Now that the outline of your main design is established, you can have some fun adding more details.",
        "Take a negative stencil and fill in a few shapes around the design.",
        "For example, you might take a star stencil and scatter a few stars around your image.",

        "Remove your template from the work surface.",
        "Once you\u2019re satisfied with your design, carefully peel off the template.",
        "Make sure not to rip the template or your work surface.",
