Finer lines and more complicated designs could be more likely to smudge and become unrecognizable. Stick with clear shapes. Decide how large you want it to be. A bigger tattoo may be more likely to appear to be hand drawn, whereas a smaller tattoo may look more \"authentic.\" Design your tattoo according to the effect you want to achieve."

Pick one that isn't meant to be shiny or oily; a pencil that makes smooth, dry marks will make a longer-lasting smudge-free tattoo. Jet black eyeliner makes for a striking temporary tattoo, but there's no reason not to choose more than one color. Try emerald, purple, and sapphire to create your design or add a small accent. Avoid liquid eyeliner. It's more difficult to keep this type of eyeliner in place on parts of your body other than your eyelids. Practice drawing your design with your chosen eyeliner pencils on paper. Get used to the pressure you need to exert to create smooth strokes."

Draw the tattoo onto your body. Use whatever design you like and place it wherever you want, somewhere easily reachable. Rub the tattoo with baby powder.  Apply the hairspray lightly onto the tattoo. Don't use too much, or your skin will feel extremely dry. If you spray too much by accident, get a cotton swab and dab the area around the tattoo with water. Enjoy your new tattoo.
