Fastening the Metal Studs and Finishing Up To trim to correct length, cut both side flanges of a steel stud. Use straight-cut aviation snips for this. Bend one flange up, clear of the snips\u2019 jaws, and cut across the stud\u2019s web. For easier electrical and plumbing installations later on, keep all the keyhole knockouts aligned by cutting all studs to length from the same end. Protect your hands with heavy-duty gloves.

This should be done at medium speed. Choose a clutch setting strong enough to drive the screw home, but not so strong that it strips the screw hole and weakens the joint. Fabricate metal headers by cutting the track 2 inches (5 cm) longer than the rough opening width. Cut each flange of the track  (on both ends) 1 inch (2.5 cm) lengthwise. Bend the web down 90 degrees using sheet metal locking pliers. Secure electrical cable along the center line of each stud with plastic ties screwed to the studs. Pop a plastic bushing into each knockout in order to keep the cable from rubbing against the sharp edges. Add wood blocking as needed for doors, windows and cabinets. If your steel stud wall seems flimsy, keep in mind that it gains full rigidity once drywall or sheathing is applied. Hang drywall or sheathing using 1-1/4 inch (3.1 cm), self-tapping drywall screws. They should be spaced every 8 inches (20.3 cm) along edges (where two sheets meet on a stud) and 12 inches (30.5 cm) on centers located elsewhere.
