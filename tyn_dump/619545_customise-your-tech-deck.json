Well, you can keep it if you want, but popular opinion is, it'll look heaps better without it. Get rid of the logo by dotting over it with a black sharpie. Let it dry before you start finger skating again."

Then, either keep it like that, or use a different coloured sharpie (orange, blue, red, anything! even black, for an emo deck!) and colour the brown rim of the Tech-Deck. Trust me. It looks way cooler. Even black."

Keep doing this until the nut and the wheel come out. Then, put the nut in the tool, grab a different coloured wheel, and twist that in, but turn the tool to the RIGHT. Do this until the wheel feels secure. Try to experiment! You could always change them back. Try putting a black wheel, a green wheel, a red wheel and a blue wheel. This gives your Tech-Deck the \"Hard\" look."
