If you don\u2019t mind the feeling, walk around barefoot to get an even better feel of the firmness of the ground. If the ground feels firm under the grass, then the thatch is probably about the right thickness and doesn\u2019t need to be dethatched."

Your hand is more sensitive to the spongy feeling than your feet are, so judge whether it feels too thick.
