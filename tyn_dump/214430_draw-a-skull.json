You'll use this outline to make the top portion of the skull. If you're struggling to draw a circle, use a compass or trace a round object that's as large as you want the skull to be. Draw a straight horizontal and vertical line through the center of the circle. To make guidelines for placing features, lay a ruler on your paper so it passes through the middle of the circle. Make a straight horizontal line and then turn the ruler to make a vertical line. Make the vertical line extend below the circle so you can use it to draw the jaw. Create 2 hexagons along the bottom of the horizontal line. Draw an eye socket in both of the bottom quarters of the circle. Make the top line of each hexagon along the horizontal guideline and sketch each hexagon large enough to fill half of each quarter. Leave a space that's 1/5 the width of the circle between the hexagons. Sketch the nose cavity along the vertical guideline. Make a short horizontal line on the vertical guideline so it's halfway down the eye sockets. Draw a straight line that comes down from each end and away from the center of the circle. When your pencil is close to the bottom of the circle, bring the 2 lines together in a point at the very bottom of the circle on the vertical line. The nose cavity is diamond-shaped near the bottom, but boxier near the top. Draw the angular outline of the sides and middle of the skull. Lightly sketch from the temples towards the eye socket so the skull bulges out a little. Curve the line back towards the center of the skull before making it curve away at the level of the nose cavity. Then, draw a straight line down at an angle below the nose cavity. Make this line go across horizontally to connect to the opposite side of the skull. Repeat this on the opposite side so it connects with the line you just drew. Draw the horizontal line of the middle of the skull so it's about twice the width of the nose cavity. Make the upper teeth along the horizontal line in the middle of the skull. Draw vertical ovals that extend below the line to make the teeth. Each tooth should be about 1/2 the size of the distance between the bottom of the nasal cavity and line for teeth. Sketch 3 full-size teeth to the right and the left of the vertical guideline. Then, draw 2 smaller ovals that at both ends to show teeth that are receding.

Other areas to shade include:\nThe top sides of the skull\nAlong the jawline\nTo the sides of the nasal cavity Drawing the Side View of a Skull Draw a circle that's slightly longer at the ends. Instead of making an oval with narrow ends, sketch a circle that's as big as you want the skull to be. Make the circle a little longer than it is wide, but don't make the ends taper. Sketch a concentric circle and make guidelines through the skull. Lightly draw another circle inside the one you just drew. Make this circle 1/4 the distance from the larger circle.

To help you draw the jaw, put your pencil on the vertical line where it touches the bottom of the smaller circle. Draw a straight horizontal line to 1 side of the skull.

Place your pencil on the top of the jawline where it sticks away from the skull. As you draw up towards where the nose would be, make the line curve in towards where the bottom horizontal guideline meets the vertical guideline of the jaw. Then, draw the line back up at an angle and make it bump out a little. The top bump is the brow before it reconnects to the skull. Sketch the eyesocket and shade it in. Draw a vertical crescent shape just behind and below the brow. Extend the crescent until it's halfway down the length of the nose cavity. Then, shade in the eye socket so it looks empty and deep. Draw a jagged line at the bottom of the skull where it meets the jawline. Sketch a line coming down below the eye socket and bring it up towards the center of the skull. Keep drawing the line in a horizontal direction that zigs and zags a little until it reaches the center jawline. Then, make the jagged line bend down so it connects to the curve of the skull. This creates the bottom of the skull itself. Make the upper and lower rows of teeth. Draw an elongated S-shape down the middle of the jaw and make 2 faint horizontal lines that go from the side of the jaw to the shape. Leave a gap between the lines that's big enough to fit the teeth. Then, draw 6 or 7 teeth along each horizontal line. Make the teeth that are closest to the S-shape about the same width as the eye socket.

        "Place your pencil on the top of the jawline where it sticks away from the skull.",
        "As you draw up towards where the nose would be, make the line curve in towards where the bottom horizontal guideline meets the vertical guideline of the jaw.",
        "Then, draw the line back up at an angle and make it bump out a little.",
        "The top bump is the brow before it reconnects to the skull.",
        "Sketch the eyesocket and shade it in.",
        "Draw a vertical crescent shape just behind and below the brow.",
        "Extend the crescent until it's halfway down the length of the nose cavity.",
        "Then, shade in the eye socket so it looks empty and deep.",
        "Draw a jagged line at the bottom of the skull where it meets the jawline.",
        "Sketch a line coming down below the eye socket and bring it up towards the center of the skull.",
        "Keep drawing the line in a horizontal direction that zigs and zags a little until it reaches the center jawline.",
        "Then, make the jagged line bend down so it connects to the curve of the skull.",
        "This creates the bottom of the skull itself.",
        "Make the upper and lower rows of teeth.",
        "Draw an elongated S-shape down the middle of the jaw and make 2 faint horizontal lines that go from the side of the jaw to the shape.",
        "Leave a gap between the lines that's big enough to fit the teeth.",
        "Then, draw 6 or 7 teeth along each horizontal line.",
        "Make the teeth that are closest to the S-shape about the same width as the eye socket.",
        "Sketch the teeth at the other end of the row progressively smaller until they're only slivers at the end.Tip: Leave out a few teeth if you don't want your skull to have a full set.",
        "Erase visible guidelines.",
        "To make your drawing look finished, use a small eraser and remove the horizontal and vertical guidelines that you can still see.",
        "If you've already drawn over them, leave them.",
        "Just erase the ones that stand out.",
        "Instead of using a large eraser, try working with the eraser on the end of a pencil.",
        "Shade in parts of the skull where you want to show depth.",
        "Press firmly as you sketch along the back of the skull to show its curve.",
        "Then, shade in the center of the skull behind the eye socket.",
        "Make this a large crescent shape and use cross-hatching to make the skull appear bumpy.",
        "Make the jaw look distinctive by shading the top of it where it meets the bottom of the skull."
