Play with a friend who already knows the solution. The aim of the game is to determine how many petals around the rose there are each time multiple dice are rolled. Get someone to facilitate the game for you. They will roll the dice and tell you the number of petals around the rose. The facilitator should not disclose the reasoning behind this number. That's for you to work out! Eventually, when you solve the puzzle, you will be able guess the number of petals on a particular roll of the dice on your own. Roll the dice. Your friend (who already knows the solution) will reveal how many petals around the rose there are for this roll. At first, it will be unclear how they got this number. Get them to roll the dice several times and tell you how many petals there are each time. Can you see a pattern emerging that determines the number of petals around the rose each turn? Take your time. It may take several rolls to figure out the solution. Solving the Puzzle Pay attention to the name of the game. Solving this puzzle requires you to exercise your problem-solving skills. Think 'outside the box' or laterally to assess the information you have in front of you. This will help you see the hidden rules of the game determining the number of petals around the rose. For example, the game is called \"Petals Around the Rose\" and this name is significant. Why might it be called petals around the rose? How might this name relate to the faces of the dice you are seeing? Look at the dice with dots in the middle. Dice showing 3 or 5 have dots in the center of their face. These dice represent the roses. The petals are the dots surrounding this center dot. For example, a die with a 5 on it has 4 petals around the rose. A die with a 3 on it has 2 petals around the rose. A die with 1 only has one dot on its face. It is a rose without petals. Disregard the dice showing even numbers. Dice showing 2, 4 or 6 do not have a dot in the middle of their face. They are not roses and you can disregard them. They don't count when you are adding up the total number of petals around the rose for a particular roll. Add up the total amount of petals and get the answer for each roll. If there are no petals or roses, the answer is zero. For example, if you get a roll with 5, 4, 6, 1, there are 4 petals around the rose. 4 and 6 are even numbers so the dice showing these numbers do not count as roses. The die with 1 represents a rose without a petal. The die showing a 5 has 4 petals around the rose. Therefore, the total number of petals around the rose is 4. If you get 2, 4, 6, 1, then the total number of petals will be zero. There are no dice with dots in the center and therefore no roses. Sharing the Game with Others Get 4 - 5 dice and a willing friend. Challenge a friend to play the game and solve the puzzle for themselves. Roll the dice. Ask your friend, \"How many petals around the rose are there?\" Be prepared to roll the dice as many times as necessary. Remember that different people will take different lengths of time to work out the solution. Some even say that the smarter you are the longer it takes you to work it out!
