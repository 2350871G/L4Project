Hold your hands on your hips and look in the mirror for any obvious changes to the shape of your breasts. Raise your arms and look again for any swelling, redness, or bulging. Lie down and hold one arm behind your head. Use your other hand to firmly rub the opposite breast in circles so you can feel any lumps. Repeat this by putting the opposite arm behind your head and feeling the other breast. Ensure that you check the entire breast, from your collarbone to the top of your abdomen. If you do the self-exam a few days after your period has stopped, your breasts will be less tender and swollen which makes the exam easier."
