        "Drying and Buffing Your Boots Support the shape of the boot with paper.",
        "If the boot appears misshapen after cleaning, you should reshape it before it dries.",
        "Typically, the toe of the boot is the part that gets most out of shape from cleaning.",
        "To fix it, crumple up paper and stuff it down into the boot to push misshapen areas into place.",
        "You can use newspaper, scrap paper, extra paper bags, or any other type of paper to shape your boot.",
        "Let your boots air dry for 24 hours.",
        "Once the cleaning agent has been applied and any stains treated, let the boots air dry in warm air.",
        "They should take around 24 hours to dry completely, depending on how wet they got during cleaning.",
        "Do not place the boots near high heat, such as a fire.",
        "High heat could potentially melt any glue holding the boot together, or destroy the leather parts of your boots.",
        "Buff your boots.",
        "Once the boots are dry, they may still look a little funny.",
        "This is because the surface of the nubuck is likely matted and needs some care.",
        "Use a clean, dry brush to lightly brush the surface of the boot in 1 direction.",
        "This will make the boots look like normal again.",
        "If the boot is really matted, so much so that brushing it doesn\u2019t do much, hold the boot close to the steam from a kettle and then scrub it with a toothbrush.",
        "The steam should untangle the matted nap, allowing you to scrub it straight and make it stand up again.",
        "Condition or seal your boots.",
        "Pick a conditioner or sealer to protect the newly clean surface of your boots.",
        "Follow the directions on the packaging when applying it.",
        "In general, these products are applied by putting a small amount of them on a clean rag and wiping it over the entire surface of the boot.",
        "Conditioner is made just to keep the leather supple and not dried out.",
        "A water-proofing product is meant to help keep water from soaking into the leather.",
        "Both products can be great for your boots but they should not be used at the same time."
