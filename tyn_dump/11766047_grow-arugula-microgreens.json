Fill your chosen container up to the brim with an organic potting soil mix, then level it out and pat it down lightly.Any commercial organic potting soil mix from a garden supply center is good for growing microgreens in. However, if you want to make your own organic potting soil, you can combine about 3 parts peat moss, 1 part sand, 1 part perlite, and 1 part compost. You could also make microgreen growing containers out of plastic deli tubs. Just be sure to drill or poke holes in the bottom for drainage."
