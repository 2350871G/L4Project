Don\u2019t try to force a feeler gauge into a gap that\u2019s too small since you could damage the parts or bend the gauge. Your feeler gauge will either have a consistent thickness or a tapered end that gets thinner. If you have a tapered feeler gauge, the thinnest section is the actual measurement. If the feeler gauge gets stuck in the gap, spray a lubricant like WD-40 onto it so it can slide out easily.Tip: To get an idea of how much friction you should feel, put a sheet of paper between 2 magazines and pull it out. You should feel the same amount of friction when you slide the feeler gauge in the gap."
