Make sure there are no holes in the sides of the packets where steam might escape. If the foil tears while you\u2019re folding the packet, simply wrap another piece of foil around the torn packet. Baking and Serving the Trout Arrange the packets to lay flat on a baking sheet. Leave about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space in between each packet on the baking sheet. Make sure each packet is placed on the sheet with the folded part of the foil facing up. Spread the packets across the sheet as evenly as possible. Piling all of the packets on one side can lead to uneven cooking temperatures. Bake the fish on a baking sheet for 10-15 minutes. After the fish have been in the oven for 10 minutes, remove them and carefully open one of the packets. Flake off a small piece of the flesh to make sure that it\u2019s properly cooked. If the flesh doesn\u2019t flake, place the fish back into the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes. Cut open the foil packets to release the steam. Once the packets have cooled for 1-2 minutes, use scissors to cut the packets carefully across the top. Keep your fingers away from the openings to avoid getting burned by the steam! After the steam rises from the packets, you can use your hands to carefully pull the sides of the foil away from the fish. Broil the opened packets for 3 minutes if you want a browned top. If you like a crispy, browned top on your fish, turn your oven to its broil setting. Then, slide the trout in open packets back into the oven to cook for an additional 3 minutes. This method will also make the parsley and lemon on the fish slightly crispy. Add more herbs, fresh lemon slices, salt, and pepper to taste. The herbs and lemon slices inside of the packet will likely be slightly wilted once the fish is ready to serve. Replace them with fresh sprigs of parsley and lemon slices, and sprinkle salt and pepper over the skin to taste. If you want extra flavor, pour the juices left in the foil packet over the flesh of the trout before adding the seasons.
