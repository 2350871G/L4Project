While wearing oven mitts, bend the spoon near where the handle meets the bowl. Bend the bowl, which is the flat scoop on the spoon, up so it is at an angle. The bowl should point upwards towards the ceiling. Set the spoons to cool down in a safe spot, such as on a rack or plate, after you bend them.

Another way to hang the spoons is by drilling through the bowl instead of the handle. Make a hole about \u2153 and \u2154 of the way down the bowl.

Place the screws in the holes and attach the rack directly to your wall. To hang the rack securely, consider using a stud finder to locate the wooden supports in your wall. Attach the rack to these supports. Hanging racks work well as coat hangers near outside doors. You can also place them in the kitchen to hang tools or in a bedroom to hang clothing.

You usually can sprinkle a bunch of seeds into the planter to end up with luscious, green growth. Many different plants can grow in your bottle. Decorative plants like flowers or cactuses are fine, but also consider growing herbs and vegetables. Make multiple planters! Typically, several planters can fit on a single, vertical column. Building a Spoon Hanging Rack Wear safety glasses and a respirator mask. Constructing a rack requires some cutting and drilling. To protect yourself from dust and fragments, wear the safety gear at all times. This is especially important when working with metal, since loose shards may fly off the spoons as you drill them. Select your clothing carefully as well. Avoid anything that can get caught in your tools. Gloves can get caught in saw blades, but you may want them while working with the metal components. Saw an 18 in \u00d7 5 in (46 cm \u00d7 13 cm) board. This is an average board size meant to hold 5 spoons. The board should be approximately \u20442 in (1.3 cm) deep so it doesn't protrude from your wall too much. You can recycle a piece of pine or another variety of sturdy wood for your project. You can cut the board into different shapes and sizes. Your rack may also hold more or less spoons. Use a jig saw, circular saw, or another tool to easily cut large boards down to size. Mark every 3 in (7.6 cm) across the center of the board. First, measure  1 in (2.5 cm) from each side of the board. Mark these points out with a pencil, then begin measuring and marking every 3 in (7.6 cm) span between them. The middle marks are where you will hang the spoons. The 1 in (2.5 cm) marks serve as margins. Avoid hanging any spoons before these points. They will be too close to the sides of the board. You can space your spoons out differently than this. Hang less spoons and leave wider gaps between each one, for example. Adjust the measurements to suit your project's design! Drill 4 holes near the board's ends. To keep your rack looking neat, make sure these holes are aligned before you drill them. Place them on the 1 in (2.5 cm) margin marks you made earlier. Measure up 1 in (2.5 cm) from the board's bottom and top edge on each side. Then, use a drill bit about 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) thick to create 2 holes on each side. Always keep the holes at least 1 in (2.5 cm) from the board's sides to avoid damaging it. Make the holes with a drill 1 size less than the screws you plan on using to attach the board to the wall. Boil the spoons in a pot on the stove to bend them. The easiest way to work the spoons into hangers is to soften them up. Fill a pot with water and boil it on your stove. Drop 5 spoons into the bubbling water and leave them alone for 15 minutes. Carefully take them out of the pot using a pair of tongs. While wearing oven mitts, bend the spoon near where the handle meets the bowl. Bend the bowl, which is the flat scoop on the spoon, up so it is at an angle. The bowl should point upwards towards the ceiling. Set the spoons to cool down in a safe spot, such as on a rack or plate, after you bend them. Another way to bend the spoons is to set them on the edge of a flat surface. Hold them in place with a pair of pliers, then bend the spoons against the surface using a second pair of pliers. Drill 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) holes through the handle of each spoon. To protect whatever surface you drill over, slide a piece of scrap wood underneath the spoon before drilling it. Position the drill about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the end of the handle. Drilling through the metal takes a dose of patient. Stop and blow the metal fragments away on occasion to keep the hole clear. Another way to hang the spoons is by drilling through the bowl instead of the handle. Make a hole about \u2153 and \u2154 of the way down the bowl. The spoon will hang by the bowl, leaving the handle to hold your coat. Secure the spoons to the board using the lines you marked earlier. Position 1 spoon on each of the marks you made along the center of the board. Put a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) wood screw through the hole in each spoon's handle. Then, use a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) drill bit to fasten the spoons in place. If you hang the spoons by the bowl, you will need double the amount of screws. Attaching the spoons to the board is done the same way, though. Fasten the board to the wall using wood screws. Pick out a good location to display your work. All that is left are the 4 holes on the board. These need to be filled with 3 in (7.6 cm) wood screws. Place the screws in the holes and attach the rack directly to your wall. To hang the rack securely, consider using a stud finder to locate the wooden supports in your wall. Attach the rack to these supports. Hanging racks work well as coat hangers near outside doors. You can also place them in the kitchen to hang tools or in a bedroom to hang clothing. Decorate the rack however you want. Consider painting the wood or trying ribbons over the screws. If you're feeling extra radical, you may even use forks instead of spoons. Repurposing Recycled Furniture Check your own trash and ask around to find items to recycle. Plenty of items are thrown away every day, so you aren't at a loss for things to recycle. To start, pay close attention to what you are throwing out. For more options, visit trash dumps in your area. These places are typically accessible and brimming with all sorts of old clothing, furniture, and other items you can turn into decorations. Ask others for items they want to get rid of. Flea markets, antique stores, and attics are all god places to find unusual items. Items placed on lawns or in dumpsters for disposal are usually fair game. However, you may want to ask if you can take the item to avoid any trouble. Refinish and polish surfaces on recycled items. A lot of old furniture may be worth its weight in gold underneath that ugly exterior. Objects like damaged dresser knobs are easy to replace. Broader wood and metal surfaces can't be replaced. Try refinishing a surface by [Use Sandpaper|sanding]], painting, or polishing it until it looks as good as new! For example, you can refurbish an old chair. If you don't have a good fabric, try covering the chair in old jeans. Transform old items by giving them new uses. Items like wooden vegetable boxes and retro curtains may seem like trash, but they can easily be turned into working furniture components. Use that old box to store magazines and turn the curtains into pillows, for instance. These items will be completely unique to your room! Even throwaway items like soda bottles and paper waste can be turned into furniture. Cut the bottles apart to turn them into storage containers or decorations. Fold paper into origami decorations.",
