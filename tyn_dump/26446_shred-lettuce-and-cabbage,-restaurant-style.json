    "text": " Shredding Lettuce and Cabbage by Hand Begin with a head of lettuce or cabbage. Iceberg lettuce is usually served alongside dishes like enchiladas and on tostadas, while green cabbage is the base of many slaw salads. Peel off visibly bad leaves from the outside. The exterior leaves on lettuce and cabbage tend to get damaged. The head should get fresher as you go inward. Locate the thick stalk and have the flat side towards the cutting board.  Slam the head of the lettuce stalk straight down against the cutting board. Pretend there is a nail on the cutting board and you are using the stalk as a hammer. Hit it with about that much force. This will break the stalk, and now the stalk will pull right out. Pull it out and throw it away in the compost. Cabbage doesn't do so well with this method, so it will be much easier if you cut the head in half through the stalk to the top. Then cut the stalk out by cut along the outline of the shape of the thick wedges. Chop it in half. Flip the head over so the hole from the stalk is facing the ceiling and chop the head in half vertically. Turn the head at a very slight angle (about 5 degrees) to the left.  Shred the lettuce. Chop vertically only and slowly turn the half-head until you have chopped it all. If you don't want long strips, simply cut the pile in half horizontally. You can also lay the flat side down on your cutting surface and cut strips to desired thickness. Repeat with the other half of the head.  Finished.  Shredding Lettuce and Cabbage with a Grater Remove the exterior leaves from a fresh head of lettuce or cabbage. Make sure there are no visible bruised or damaged parts left. Chop the lettuce or cabbage into quarters.  Stand a cheese grater or vegetable grater in a large bowl. This way the shredded lettuce or cabbage will land directly in the bowl. Run the lettuce or cabbage across the grater. Fine pieces of lettuce or cabbage will begin to fall. Continue until the lettuce or cabbage is shredded. Move on to the next piece and keep going until you have a nice big pile. Shredding Lettuce and Cabbage with a Blender Remove the exterior leaves from a fresh head of lettuce or cabbage. Make sure there are no visible bruised or damaged parts left. Chop the lettuce or cabbage into quarters.  Place a quarter in the blender.  Pulse the blender for a few seconds at a time. Check to see how finely the lettuce or cabbage has been chopped. Keep pulsing until it reaches the right texture. Some restaurants serve it very finely shredded; keep blending until your lettuce or cabbage looks right. Don't blend too much, though, or it will turn to pulp. Remove the shredded lettuce or cabbage from the blender. Place it in a bowl. Finish shredding the lettuce or cabbage one quarter at a time. ",
