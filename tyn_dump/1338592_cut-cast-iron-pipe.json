Ensure that there are as many cutting wheels as possible against the pipe. Apply pressure onto the handles of the cutter so the wheels cut into the pipe. You may need to score the pipe several times before you can make the final cut. You may need to rotate the pipe slightly before making the final cut if you are cutting replacement pipe on the ground. Repeat these steps at all other chalk lines.  Using a Reciprocating Saw Fit your saw with a long metal cutting blade.
