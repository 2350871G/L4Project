Put two tablespoons of white flour into a bowl and add about lukewarm water slowly. Begin with just under one cup of water, stirring with a fork, whisk, or kitchen mixer to get the lumps out and ensure an even texture. Keep adding water little by little until you reach the consistency you desire. It should have a smooth texture: not runny, but not thick like dough."

You\u2019ll need to layer the mask about three times, so make a lot of newspaper strips. The length of the strips doesn\u2019t matter as much as the width, but extremely long strips the length of an actual newspaper page will be unwieldy and messy when soaked in paper mach\u00e9 paste."
