        "Wipe away the dust from sanding using a tack cloth.",
        "Use a clean tack cloth to wipe down the whole canoe again before you apply a second coat.",

        "You could even use multiple colors to make a more complex camouflage design.",
        "You can repeat the process for a third coat if you aren\u2019t happy with how it looks yet, but 2 coats is generally enough.",
        "Wait at least 48 hours before putting your canoe in the water.",
        "The paint will be dry after 24 hours, but wait 48 hours before using the canoe to be extra sure that the paint is fully cured.",
