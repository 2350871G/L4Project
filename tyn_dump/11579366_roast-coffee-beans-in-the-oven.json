        "You will need to roast your green coffee beans in batches unless you only purchased a small amount.",
        "Place the perforated metal pan on a baking sheet and put both in the oven.",
        "Place the baking sheet on the middle rack in your oven.",
        "Take note of the oven temperature from the thermometer.",
        "Turn on the oven light so you can see the beans through the oven\u2019s window.",
        "Close the oven door, but be prepared to open it often.",
        "Stir the coffee beans every 1-4 minutes.",
        "Watch the clock, or set a timer, and open the oven every few minutes to stir the beans with the wooden spoon.",
        "Take note of the oven\u2019s temperature and the colour of the beans.",
        "The beans will turn from green to yellow within the first few minutes of roasting.",
        "Over the next several minutes, the beans will then start to turn brown.",
        "Listen carefully to the sounds made by the beans as they roast, especially when you have the oven closed and the sound might not be as obvious.",
        "Reduce the oven temperature to 220 \u00b0C (428 \u00b0F) when the beans turn light brown.",
        "Keep a careful eye on your beans as they turn from a yellowish colour to light brown.",
        "Once you see the beans start to turn into a brown colour, reduce the temperature of the oven to 220 \u00b0C (428 \u00b0F).",
        "Do not stop paying attention to the beans after you\u2019ve reduced the oven\u2019s temperature.",
        "Individual ovens operate differently and temperatures on an oven\u2019s controls may not always equal the temperatures inside an oven.",
        "You will need to learn your oven specifically as you experiment with roasting coffee beans.",
        "Watch and listen for the first crack of the coffee beans.",
        "The first crack should occur when the beans reach an internal temperature of approximately 205 \u00b0C (401 \u00b0F).",
        "The first crack will sound similar to popping corn, but the coffee beans do not expand in the same way corn does.",
        "Take note of the oven\u2019s temperature and the amount of time the beans have been in the oven when first crack occurs.",
        "Stir the beans.",
        "Coffee roasted up until the first crack is equivalent to a very light roast.",
        "If this is the type of coffee you prefer, remove the beans from the oven.",
        "If you prefer at least a medium-light roast, or darker, keep the beans in the oven past first crack.",
        "Stop roasting 1-2 minutes after the first crack for a medium-light roast.",
        "Start a timer for 2 minutes immediately after the first crack occurs.",
        "Beans roasted to a temperature of 220 \u00b0C (428 \u00b0F) are typically considered a medium-light roast and should appear light brown in colour.",
        "This temperature can occur quickly after the first crack, therefore you have to pay attention.",
        "Anytime between the 1 and 2-minute mark after the first crack, take the beans out of the oven.",
        "Take note of the oven\u2019s temperature and the time when you take the beans out of the oven.",
        "You can use this info for future reference when roasting more coffee beans.",
        "Your first time roasting coffee beans may produce a roast that\u2019s lighter or darker than you prefer.",
        "It may take several tries before you get the exact roast you prefer.",
        "Continue roasting 2 minutes after the first crack for a darker roast.",
        "If you keep the beans in the over longer than 2 minutes after the first crack, they\u2019ll start to turn from light brown to dark brown.",
        "They will also appear smooth and shiny.",
        "At this stage, the beans have been roasted to a level that is typically used for espresso.",
        "A second crack will then occur, which won\u2019t sound as obvious, which will make the taste of the beans more intense.",
        "At this stage, the beans have been roasted to a level typically used to make lattes and cappuccinos.",
        "You may need to experiment with the timing of removing the beans until you\u2019ve learned exactly what the beans will look like when they\u2019re at your perfect roast.",
        "Pour the roasted beans into a colander to cool for 2 hours.",
        "Take the baking sheet out of the oven using oven mitts.",
        "Do not touch the hot beans as you transfer them to the colander.",
        "Let the beans cool for at least 2 hours in the colander before moving them.",
        "A colander or strainer will allow the cool air to reach the beans on all sides, but you can also use another baking sheet if you prefer.",
        "Shake the colander or strainer to help cool the beans faster.",
        "This will also help remove the chaff from the beans.",
        "Let the beans sit uncovered at room temperature for 2 days.",
        "After the beans have been roasted in your oven, they will continue to release carbon dioxide gases for up to 48 hours, as they cool.",
        "During this time, do not seal the beans in an air-tight container or attempt to ground them.",
        "You can, however, put the beans into a container for short-term storage, but do not seal the lid.",
        "Once the beans can be used, you\u2019ll get the best tasting coffee within 5 days.",
        "Storing Roasted Coffee Beans Locate an airtight storage container for your roasted beans.",
        "Feel free to use a glass or plastic storage container or a ziploc-type bag.",
        "The only requirement for the container is that it be airtight either from a lid or a zipper.",
        "You can put your newly roasted coffee beans in this container after they\u2019ve cooled for a couple of hours.",
        "Do not seal the container until the beans have de-gassed over 48 hours.",
        "You can also purchase special containers that are designed to release CO2, similar to the bags used for commercially sold coffee.",
        "Store your roasted coffee beans at room temperature in a low humidity area.",
        "Place your sealed storage container, with your roasted coffee beans, where they\u2019ll stay a consistent temperature and where there isn\u2019t an excessive amount of humidity.",
        "Coffee beans prefer the same condition as bread.",
        "Do not store your roasted coffee beans in the fridge or the freezer for the short-term.",
        "Only store your beans in the freezer if you aren\u2019t going to use them right away.",
        "Choose a dark storage location or opaque container to protect the beans.",
        "As with the temperature and humidity, roasted coffee beans prefer a storage location where they do not get a lot of light.",
        "The sealed container will ensure your roasted beans are not exposed to too much oxygen.",
        "A cupboard or opaque container will ensure your beans are not exposed to too much light.",
        "Store your coffee as beans and only grind your beans when you\u2019re ready to make coffee.",
        "Use your roasted coffee beans within 7 days for the best flavour.",
        "After 7 days, the coffee will still taste okay, but the beans start to lose their flavour and quality.",
        "Ideally, only roast the quantity of coffee beans that you can use in a week so you have the best tasting coffee at all times.",
        "Grind your beans immediately before you make your coffee.",
        "Your coffee beans can keep for weeks or months after being roasted, as long as they\u2019re kept in the proper conditions.",
        "Freeze your roasted coffee beans if you can\u2019t use them immediately.",
        "Ensure your roasted coffee beans are in a container or bag that is as airtight as possible.",
        "Store the bag or container in the freezer for as long as is needed.",
        "Allow the beans to defrost once you\u2019ve removed them from the freezer; do not use the beans until they\u2019re at room temperature.",
        "Once defrosted, store the beans out of the freezer.",
        "Freezing coffee beans will dehydrate them and potentially cause condensation inside the bag or container.",
        "Finding the Perfect Green Coffee Find a store or roastery from which to purchase your green coffee.",
        "Conduct some research about roasteries or coffee-related stores in your general area.",
        "Look for small roasteries that operate in your area and ask them if they\u2019d sell you a small amount of green coffee.",
        "You could also ask those roasteries where they purchase their green coffee from.",
        "Also, search for online stores that sell green coffee and who will ship to your location.",
        "You may get a larger selection of coffee beans at an online store than a physical store.",
        "You will likely get more personal advice and the chance to smell the coffee beans if you purchase at a physical store.",
        "Buy a small amount or a sample pack of green coffee for experimenting.",
        "Coffee roasted at home needs to be done in small batches, around 50\u2013100 grams (1.8\u20133.5 oz) per batch.",
        "However, it may take several batches of experimenting before you\u2019ve perfected your roasting times and temperatures.",
        "Buy a small amount of green coffee to start and experiment with, such as 500 grams (18 oz).",
        "Or, purchase a sample pack of green coffee so you can try different types of coffee beans in your experiments.",
        "Coffee beans get larger, but lighter, as they\u2019re roasted.",
        "If you roast 100 grams (3.5 oz) of green coffee, you\u2019ll end up with approximately 50 grams (1.8 oz) of roasted coffee.",
        "Remember to buy decaf green coffee beans if you want decaf coffee.",
        "Decaf coffee is not made during the roasting process, therefore, remember to purchase the correct green coffee ahead of time.",
        "Some decaf coffee beans start off a darker colour than non-decaf beans, which may be confusing as you start to roast them.",
        "The first crack of decaf beans may also not be as noticeable, therefore more attention is required while roasting.",
        "Green coffee beans are decaffeinated as part of the agricultural process where they\u2019re grown, not by the roastery.",
        "Green coffee beans are typically steamed, then rinsed with a solvent to remove the caffeine.",
        "This process is usually repeated until sufficient caffeine has been removed.",
        "Purchase larger batches of green coffee once you\u2019ve perfected your technique.",
        "Green coffee beans can last for several years in storage.",
        "Feel free to stock up on green coffee beans, especially if there\u2019s a sale or discount available.",
        "Green coffee beans, unlike roasted beans, do not lose any of their flavour or quality while in storage.",
        "Store your green coffee beans in a fabric (or burlap) bag in a location of your house where the temperature and humidity remain fairly constant."
