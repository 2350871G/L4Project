Steel brushes are more aggressive and can wear on the barrel, but may be useful in situations with old, caked-on, and hard deposits. Stick with bronze unless you have a reason to use steel. Nylon brushes are also available, but bronze is a good compromise in most cases. If you are shooting jacketed bullets, you will have some copper-colored gilding metal in the bore. To remove copper (gilding metal), you will need to use a solvent designed to remove copper. Your gun dealer can guide you in selecting this. Copper solvent will eventually dissolve the bronze bristles on your brush. In that case, you can use a steel brush (sparingly) or a nylon brush while you are using copper solvents. If you are shooting non-jacketed bullets, you may have lead in the bore. Your gun dealer can guide you in selecting a product to help remove lead."
