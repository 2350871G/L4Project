Position the long side of the box parallel to the cut end of the wrapping paper, making sure the paper extends past either side of the gift box in this orientation. For a standard shirt box, you should leave about 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) of paper on either short side. Deeper boxes will require more paper on either side. If the box is too long for this orientation, turn it 45 degrees so that the short end of the box is perpendicular to the cut end of the paper. Make sure the gift inside is carefully padded with tissue paper (especially if it\u2019s fragile) so that it doesn\u2019t get jostled around.

Mark a small pen or pencil line at this point. Alternatively, you can use a ruler or tape measure to calculate the perimeter of the box and measure it out on the wrong side of the wrapping paper."

You may use double-sided tape right along the inside edge of the paper or place matte gift wrap tape on the top edge, overlapping the paper and box.

        "Position the ribbon so that it\u2019s aligned with the \u201cwaistline\u201d of the box.",
        "Draw them together so that they meet in the horizontal and vertical center of the base of the box (which is facing upwards).",
        "Cross the ribbon ends and wrap them around the box in the other direction.",
        "Crisscross the ribbon ends at the center of the box.",

        "Then wrap the ribbon around the box cross-wise, flipping the box right-side up as you do so.",
        "If you\u2019ve already wrapped the ribbon around the box the long way, you\u2019ll now wrap it around the short way.",

        "Knot the ribbon ends at the center and create a simple bow.",
        "Hold the loose ribbon ends upwards and tie them together, around the taut length of ribbon, with a single overhand knot.",
        "You can then create a simple bow.",
        "Follow the same process as you would when tying your shoelaces.",
        "If you\u2019re using a wider ribbon, you can either trim the ends to a neat 45-degree angle or cut out a decorative V-shaped notch.",
        "If you plan to include a hanging gift tag in your wrapping, thread one of the ribbon ends through the hanging gift tag\u2019s loop before you complete the overhand knot and bow.",
        "Tuck a sprig of berries or branches into the bow for a fresh festive touch."
