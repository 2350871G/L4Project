        "Discard any slime you remove.",
        "If the slime is really stuck on, then you can chill it with an ice cube or ice pack, and then try to pull off the slime bits.",
        "Don't use the serrated part of a knife or even a sharp, flat-edged knife on your furniture or you may damage it.",
        "Pour some distilled water onto a clean cloth.",
        "Distilled water is less likely to discolor furniture because it does not have the same minerals that tap water does.",
        "Pour enough distilled water onto a clean washcloth to get it wet, and then wring out the excess water.",
        "If water alone is not strong enough to remove the stain, you can try blotting with a 50/50 solution of water and vinegar.",
        "However, make sure to test this on a discreet place on the furniture first since the vinegar may discolor certain types of fabric.",
        "Blot any visible stains with the damp cloth.",
        "Place the damp cloth onto the stained area and press on it with your hand.",
        "After pressing it once, pick it up.",
        "Then, turn it over or find a clean section of the cloth on the same side, and press the clean section of the cloth onto the stain again.",
        "Keep doing this until you have removed the stain completely.",
        "Cleaning Slime Stains on Walls Remove any remaining slime with your fingers or a credit card.",
        "If there is still a blob of slime sticking to your wall, make sure to remove it before attempting to clean the slime stain.",
        "Otherwise, you may end up spreading the stain to other parts of the wall when you are trying to clean it.",
        "If you cannot pull the slime off with your fingers, use an old credit card to scrape the slime off of the wall.",
        "Push the credit card against the wall just above the slime and move the card downwards while still pressing the card against the wall.",
        "Make a paste of baking soda, water, and vinegar.",
        "Since slime stains on a wall can be especially stubborn, it is best to create a paste of baking soda, water, and vinegar to remove it.",
        "Mix together 4 tbs of baking soda, 1 tbs of water, and 1 tbs of vinegar.",
        "This should form a thick paste that you can apply to the stain on the wall.",
        "If the paste is too thick to spread, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of water to thin it.",
        "If the paste is too thin, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of baking soda to thicken it.",
        "Place a paper towel on the floor below the stain on the wall.",
        "Place a paper towel under the spot on the wall where you will be placing the paste.",
        "This will help to protect the floor below the stain in case any of the paste drips down.",
        "You can also use old newspapers to protect the floor.",
        "Put on rubber gloves and use your fingers to apply the paste.",
        "Don\u2019t handle the paste with your bare hands since it may irritate your skin.",
        "Put on a pair of rubber gloves and then begin caking the paste onto the stain with your fingers\nMake sure to coat the stain evenly to ensure that the paste will have the maximum effect.",
        "Let the paste dry for 2 hours and brush it off with a paper towel.",
        "The paste should be dry after about 2 hours, but it might take more or less time depending on the amount of paste you apply.",
        "Once the paste is dry, you can use a dry paper towel to gently brush the paste off onto the paper towel that you placed on the ground.",
        "Throw away the paper towel with the baking soda paste when you are done.",
        "Repeat this as many times as needed to remove the stain on the wall."
