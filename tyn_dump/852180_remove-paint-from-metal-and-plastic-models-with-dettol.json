            "description": "You will need the following:\nAn original bottle of Dettol solution, which is a liquid disinfectant available from most supermarkets, pharmacists or general stores. Do not get any variation of the Dettol solution or your results may vary from those intended. Two old toothbrushes, preferably hard or medium in strength, as soft toothbrushes fail to remove as much paint. Some sort of fine object, such as toothpick, pin or paper clip. These will come in handy later on in the process. A large container, about the size of a gherkin jar or larger. Glass or plastic will suffice, but make sure it is one you can do without as it will not be usable after the process. Several rags or cloths, preferably thin so you can feel models through them. Again, make sure they are old and unwanted. Two rubber gloves. Dettol, while not dangerous, does dehydrate skin and can cause peeling and discomfort on areas exposed to it for too long. Wearing thin surgeon's gloves, or similar, will help you avoid this problem. Access to running water, preferably where you are working with the process. Newspapers or covers for the area you will be working with, as it can get quite messy and the paint that you remove will be hard to get off any surfaces should it fall onto them. A well ventilated room. The mixture can give off a lot of fumes, which although harmless, can be a bit overwhelming in a confined space. An open door or a few open windows should allow sufficient airflow."

            "description": "You can create as much of the solution as you require, and to varying degrees of concentration too, so there are no hard and fast rules. Generally, a 1:1 ratio of Dettol to cold tap water in the container you have brought will give you the best result in 24 hours. You can make the mixture with more water, for example a 1:2 ratio, but the models will need to rest in the solution for longer. So if you have bought a whole bottle of Dettol, the easiest thing to do is simply pour the bottle in and then mix in an equal amount of water, and add more if you wish. Nothing else needs to be done to the solution."
