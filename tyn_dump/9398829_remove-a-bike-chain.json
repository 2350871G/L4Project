Stop rotating the handle when the rivet is almost all the way out of the link, as reinstalling the pin after it falls out is nearly impossible. Be very careful that your pin doesn't come all of the way out because it's very unlikely that you'll be able to get it back into the link. If you do accidentally push your pin all of the way out, you can try taking that link out and shortening your chain to the next undamaged link. However, this can make it hard for you to shift into certain gears. Another option is to visit a bike shop to ask about getting a new pin for your chain or to replace the chain. Sometimes your chain tool will slide so that it's not directly over the pin. Not only will you have a difficult time getting the chain tool to push out the pin, it can also damage the chain by deforming the outer link."

You can find a chain tool online or at your local bike shop. Insert the pin on one of the links on your bike chain into the chain tool. The chain tool should have 2 prongs on it (next to the small metal pin) that will fit around one of the links on your bike chain.

When you\u2019re ready to put your chain back on, use the chain tool to push the rivet back into the link you separated. Taking off a Master Link Chain Find the master link on your bike chain. Master links usually look different than the other links on the chain. Look for a link with different coloring on the side, or a link that has pins (the round metal pins in the center of the links) that are different from all the rest. Your master link may also have an arrow on it. Master link chains are the most common chain used on modern, multi-speed bikes. Use master link pliers to squeeze the master link together.

Carefully pull the chain up and off the sprockets on your bike. It should come off easily now that the master link is separated. To put your chain back on, reattach the rivets at the ends of the chain and use the master link pliers to lock the master link in place. Removing a Split Link Chain Locate the split link on your chain. The split link will look different than the rest of the links on your chain. Look for the link with a metal side plate that\u2019s cut out in the middle. Split link chains are normally used on single-speed bikes, such as children's bikes and beach cruisers. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to release the metal plate on the split link. Place one jaw of the pliers on the right side of the split link\u2019s left rivet.
