    "text": " Making a Fancy Zelo Mask Create the base for your template. Start with a rectangle that reaches from your nose to the back of your jaw, and from the bridge of your nose down to your chin. You are only making one side for right now. You'll be cutting two identical shapes, then sewing them together. Refine your template. Cut the left side edge an outward curve. Next, cut from the top-left corner at a downward angle towards the right for about \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters), then cut straight across towards the right side edge. Use the template to cut two identical shapes out of light blue felt. Trace the template twice first, then cut the shapes out with sharp scissors. Use stiff felt, if possible, about 3 millimeters thick. You can also use light blue vinyl instead. You can also use light blue jersey fabric, but be aware that it won't hold its shape as well. Sew the front, curved edges together. Place the two pieces together so that the right sides are facing in. Sew along the left side edge (the one with the bigger curve) from top to bottom. You can do this by hand or on a sewing machine. Use a matching thread color and a 1/4-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Consider adding some embroidery down the front seam. Turn the mask so that the front is facing you. Load an embroidery needle with black embroider thread, then sew a series of X's down the front seam, from top to bottom. This will give your mask a rustic, hand-sewn feel. Even though you are going for a rustic feel, try to be as neat as possible. Bind the top and bottom edges with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) black ribbon. Cut the ribbon down so that it is the same length as the entire top edge. Fold it over the top edge, sandwiching it inside, then sew the sides of the ribbon down. It's best if you do this by hand; this way, you can be sure that you sew through both sides of the ribbon. Repeat this for the bottom edge. Alternatively, you can topstitch the top and bottom edges instead. Use black thread and a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Sew down the left and right side edges. Turn the mask so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both the left and right side edges down by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters). Secure them with sewing pins. If you made your mask from vinyl, do not use sewing pins, or they will leave marks. Use clips instead. Sew down the folded left and right edges. Try to use the same color of thread as your felt. Sew about \u215b inch (0.32 centimeters) from the inside folded edge, and remember to backstitch at the stat and end of your sewing. This will create the channels for your elastic. Cut two pieces of black elastic. They need to be about three times the height of your folded edge. Make sure that the elastic is thin enough to fit through the channels you made. Thread the elastic through the channels, then knot it. Take your first piece of elastic, and thread it through the left channel. Tie the ends of the elastic into a knot, then slide the knot into the channel, out of sight. Repeat this step for the other elastic and the right side of the mask. The elastics need to be long enough to hook over your ears. Cut Totomato's symbol out of black felt. It looks like black circle with a line going through it, sort of like the non-smoking sign.

Cut straight down from the top-center mark to the side-left mark. Repeat this step for the right side. You will have something that looks like a house. Cut notches into the side edges. Fold the mask in half so that the narrow side edges match up again. Cut a > shaped notch into the side edge. Start at the bottom corner and finish at the top, right before it goes into the diagonal angle. Unfold the mask when you are done. Draw Totomato's symbol in the center with a black marker. Totomato's symbol is a large circle with a diagonal line going through it, like a non-smoking sign. The symbol should be almost the same height as the mask, with a 1/4 to 1/2-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border at the top and bottom. Thread some elastic onto a yarn or tapestry needle. Cut a piece of thin elastic so that it is long enough to loop over your ear. Thread it onto a needle with a large opening, such as a yarn needle or tapestry needle.
