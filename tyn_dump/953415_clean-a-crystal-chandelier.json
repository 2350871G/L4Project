Wipe down each crystal with the damp cloth, then immediately dry with a separate dry cloth. Try wearing an apron with pockets while you work, so that you can keep the cleaner, cloths, and any other supplies easily on hand. Instead of two cloths, you can wear two soft cotton gloves for better control and dexterity. Spray one glove with the cleaner to wipe crystals down, and keep the other glove clean to dry them. If you have a lot of crystals, you may want several pairs of gloves."
