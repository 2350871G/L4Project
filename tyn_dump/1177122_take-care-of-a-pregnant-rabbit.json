This will allow her and her kits to move around, stretch out, and exercise without difficulty. If your rabbit doesn\u2019t already have a living space that\u2019s at least 25\u201330 in (64\u201376 cm) x 15 in (38 cm), now is a good time to build or invest in a new one. Ideally, your doe\u2019s maternity lodging should be at least somewhat private, with as few bright light sources, noisy appliances, or other potentially nerve-wracking distractions in the surrounding area as possible."

Cover the bottom with 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) of soft grass hay. Make sure the structure you use is spacious and low enough for your doe to come and go easily. She\u2019ll use this space to lounge around until she\u2019s ready to kindle, or give birth. You can also offer your doe other comfortable nest-making materials, such as a layer of old rags or paper towels and scraps of shredded newspaper. The nesting materials you put down will also help keep the newborn kits warm, which is critical for their survival. If you aren\u2019t sure what size box to use for your pregnant doe, provide multiple boxes of various sizes so it can choose whichever one it wants. Rabbits that don\u2019t have a dark shelter will feel more distressed since they won\u2019t be able to hide their young.Tip: A cheap plastic cat litter box can make a perfect nesting box if you don\u2019t want to go to the trouble of making your own."

        "Not allowing your male and female rabbits to remain close could be stressful for both of them.",
        "In the worst-case scenario, it could even lead to anxiety, depression, loss of appetite and other factors that could negatively impact their ability to raise their kits.",
        "Feeding and Handling Your Rabbit Feed your rabbit a high-quality diet.",
        "Give your doe lots of grass hay and fresh greens to munch on daily.",
        "You can also use timothy pellets to supplement her diet.",

        "Rabbits love romaine lettuce, bok choy, carrot tops, kohlrabi, cilantro, basil, watercress, and mustard and beet greens.",
        "A good rule of thumb is to give your rabbit 1/4-1/8 cup (16-32 g) of pellets for every 5 pounds (2,300 g) of bodyweight.",
        "Avoid excessive feeding since overweight and obese rabbits can have more complications with pregnancy and giving birth.",
        "Providing proper nutrition is always a key part of rabbit ownership, but it\u2019s especially important where pregnant females are concerned, as she\u2019ll be eating for up to 12!",

        "Refill the receptacle with fresh water at least once a day.",
        "Female rabbits who are expecting need to stay hydrated in order to produce enough milk to nurse their young.",
        "You\u2019ll probably notice an increase in the amount of water your doe drinks every day as she begins to lactate.",
        "Pick up your doe carefully when you want to hold or move her.",
        "Nestle the lower part of her chest just above her front legs in the crook of your arm and use your hand to support her hindquarters from beneath as you gently elevate her.",
        "Hold her close to your body to ensure that she stays warm and secure.",
        "If she\u2019s feeling shy or anxious, allow her to burrow her head into your underarm until she relaxes a bit.",

        "Once or twice a day for half an hour or so at a time, take your doe out of her cage and allow her to roam freely.",
        "She can use this time to play, exercise, or leisurely explore an exciting new environment.",
        "Be sure to watch her closely to make sure she doesn\u2019t accidentally hurt herself or end up somewhere she\u2019s not supposed to be.",
        "If you\u2019re planning on letting your doe play indoors, take a moment to make sure that any and all items that could pose a danger to her are off limits before you turn her loose.",
        "This includes things like electrical cords, sharp objects, and anything small enough for her to get choked on.",

        "Caring for Your Rabbit and Her Litter After Kindling Remove any dead kits from the cage.",
        "Sadly, not every kit in the litter may survive kindling.",
        "If you come across a kit that doesn\u2019t appear to be breathing, take it out of the cage and bury or dispose of it somewhere outdoors away from your rabbit\u2019s living quarters.",
        "Otherwise, it could become a health risk to the remaining rabbits.",
        "Examine each kit closely before removing it.",
        "A motionless newborn could just be \u201cchilled,\u201d or suffering from abnormally low body temperature.",
        "The doe will be familiar with your scent, so don\u2019t worry about reaching into the cage to retrieve the unfortunate kits who didn\u2019t make it.",
        "Add a heat source to your rabbit\u2019s cage to keep the newborn kits warm.",

        "That way, the kits will be able to move back and forth from one side of the box to the other if they get too cold or too warm.",
        "You may want to pile on some additional bedding the keep the kits from coming into direct contact with the water bottle, which will likely be too hot for them.",
        "Always keep some type of gentle heat source on standby, even if it\u2019s just a warm towel.",
        "This will be especially important if your rabbit gives birth during the winter months.",

        "Fill a sterile syringe with 4-5 cc (about 4-5 mL) of lightly-warmed formula.",
        "Turn each kit over on its back and slowly release a small amount of formula into its mouth, allowing it to suckle at its own pace until it's had its fill or the liquid is gone.",
        "Repeat this process twice a day for every kit in the litter until the doe begins them herself.",
        "Keep an eye on the kits for the first few days after they\u2019re born.",

        "Wait 8 weeks to remove the kits from their mother.",

        "Once the mother starts to grow resistant to nursing, you can relocate the kits to their own separate cage or allow them to begin exploring their surroundings on their own.",
        "You should also sex and separate the male and female offspring after 8 weeks to prevent them from mating.",
        "Once the kits have been weaned and are strong enough to move around on their own, you can begin thinking about finding new homes for them."
