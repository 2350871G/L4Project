Then, take the power cord from the back of your combination amp and plug it into a wall socket. Once it's plugged in, flip the power switch to test if its power is on. On many amps, there will be a red or green light designating that there is power running to your amp. If your power cable isn't attached to the back of your amp, you may need to plug it into your amp before plugging it into the wall. If your amp doesn't turn on, switch sockets to see if it is a faulty electrical outlet. If you don't have a faulty electrical outlet and your amp still doesn't turn on, consider taking it to an instrument repair shop to get it examined."
