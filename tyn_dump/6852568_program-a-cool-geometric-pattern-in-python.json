Using the pen you created earlier you will set its color. You do this by writing \u201cpen.color(randcol)\u201d. This will now give your pen a random color when it draws out the pattern. Give the pen instructions. To get the desired effect you will need to type \u201cpen.circle(size,steps = 4)\u201d. In step 7 you created a variable \u201csize\u201d which is used here. Then the \u201csteps = 4\u201d part is what creates the square. Turn the pen. The cool pattern comes from turning the pen in every iteration of the loop. You turn the pen by writing on the next line of code \u201cpen.right(55)\u201d. This makes the pen turn right at 55 degrees every time through the loop. Increase the size of the square. Part of the cool pattern is that the square keeps getting bigger. You do this by writing the last line of code \u201csize = size +3\u201d. So every time through the loop it increases the size of the square by 3. Run the program. Your program should look like it does here.
