Divide the remaining space below in half and make a line there. This will be for the base of the average-length nose. Divide the space below that into thirds. The mouth will be at the top of those thirds; the rest will be the chin."

Starting from the left, the eyes we want are the second and fourth. The inner corner of most eyes tilts down; the outer corner can tilt up or down, depending. For our purposes, that outside corner should tilt up a bit, so that the line that describes the bottom lid looks like a very slight \"s\" shape on its side."

Join that smile line with a wide, soft \"M\" shape\u2014the top of the upper lip. Draw a very soft \"m\" shape between the two, which defines the separation of the lips, and the lip ratio. Moving the mouth up or down, and making the top and bottom lips with different proportions will help vary the look of the face you're drawing."
