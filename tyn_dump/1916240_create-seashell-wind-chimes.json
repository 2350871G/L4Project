        "You'll need 24 seashells, string or fishing line, a piece of driftwood, a power drill with 1/32 in (0.8 mm)  drill bit, and scissors.",
        "Wash your seashells.",
        "Unless you purchased sanitized or fake seashells, they need to be cleaned.",
        "Soak your seashells in a large bowl or bucket for several hours in a mixture of 1 part bleach and 3 parts water.",
        "If dirt and calcium remain on the shells, scrub them with an old toothbrush.",
        "Soak or rinse your shells in warm water and allow them to dry completely.",
        "Drill holes in the shells.",
        "Use the power drill with 1/16 in (1.6 mm) drill bit to drill one hole in each shell.",
        "You can place masking tape over the spot before drilling to prevent the shells from breaking.",
        "The hole can be placed anywhere on the shell, just keep in mind it will affect the orientation of the hanging shell.",
        "Cut your string.",
        "Cut your fishing line or thread into pieces.",
        "The number of pieces depends on the size of the driftwood.",
        "You can cut all the pieces of thread at the same length, or vary the lengths for a more eclectic look.",
        "Tie the string to the driftwood.",
        "Wrap the thread around the driftwood and tie a double knot to keep it from coming off.",
        "Keep in mind you want each piece close enough to its neighbor that the shells will bump into each other.",
        "You can hide the string and knots by decorating the top of the driftwood with shells that you hot-glue on.",
        "Add shells to the string.",
        "Thread a seashell up the string and tie a knot under it to prevent it from slipping down.",
        "Continue until all the strings are filled with seashells.",
        "Hang your driftwood.",
        "Tie string to each end of the wood and anchor it to the ceiling or hang the strings from a tree branch.",
        "Enjoy your seashell creation."
