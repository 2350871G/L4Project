Rectal thermometers will provide the most accurate results. When it comes to these thermometers, you have your choice between digital or mercury thermometers. Digital thermometers will take less time to yield results, making the experience less unpleasant for both you and your cat. Mercury thermometers are made of glass. They require a lot of precaution if you choose to use this type of thermometer when taking the temperature of a cat more likely to squirm. Regardless of the thermometer type you choose, you should label the thermometer as for use on your cat only to ensure no one else in the house mistakenly uses it."
