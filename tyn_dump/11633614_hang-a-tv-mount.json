Don't worry about making marks on the wall because the TV will cover them. Marking Studs and Holes Mark the studs on the wall where you want your TV. You need 2 studs to attach the mount to. Find 2 studs in the area you\u2019re installing the mount. Then mark the center of each one. A stud finder is the easiest way to find studs. If you don\u2019t have one, tap on the wall with a solid object. If you hear a hollow noise, there is no stud there. If you hear a solid sound, you found a stud.

If you have to, slide the mount until the screw holes are over the center of the studs. Mounts usually have multiple holes that you can drill the screws through. Choose holes that rest in the center of the studs. Drill pilot holes into each mark. Take a power drill and attach a drill bit the same size as the body of the bolts you\u2019re using (not including the width of the threads). Then drill a hole into each mark you made for the bolts. If you drill through the drywall and don\u2019t feel anything behind it, then you missed the stud. Recheck the stud location and try again. Some mounting kits have fasteners that go onto the wall before you hang the mount. Always check the instructions on your mounting kit to confirm the correct process. Attaching the Mount Line up the holes in the mount with the pilot holes. Hold the mount up and press it against the wall. Slide it so the screw holes line up with the pilot holes. Check that the mount is level one more time before attaching it. If you have a partner, let them hold the mount while you drill, or vice versa. This will make the job much easier. Drill a lag bolt into each pilot hole. Keep the mount pressed onto the wall and place a lag bolt into each hole. Press each one in slightly with your hand before drilling. Then use the power drill and drill each bolt into the wall. The mounting kit will probably come with lag bolts, but if not, you can buy them from hardware stores. Confirm that the mount is level. Before continuing with mounting the TV, do one final check. Hold the level on top and make sure the mount is completely level. If so, then go on mounting the TV. If the mount is not level, then pull the bolts out by running the drill in reverse. Readjust the mount and reattach it when it\u2019s level.",
