Set out glasses. You can provide old-fashioned glasses or any other type of cylindrical glass. Add additional fruit. You can provide a dish of strawberries that people can muddle with their mint leaves to make strawberry mojitos. You can also place mango puree or watermelon puree on your table to allow your guests to create other variations on the traditional mojito. Print out the mojito recipe on a large piece of paper.  Laminate the paper or place it inside a plastic sleeve and display it on your mojito table.  Print out supplemental mojito recipes if guests want to add additional fruit to their mojitos. For instance, let guests know how many strawberries to muddle if they want to make strawberry mojitos. Restock the table. Throughout the party, you will need to ensure that your guests have the ingredients that they need to continue making mojitos. Be sure that you purchase enough ingredients before the party. Estimate about 1 mojito per person for each hour of your party and multiply the ingredients accordingly. Making Mojito Punch Pour the mint, margarita mix and 1 cup of soda water into a blender.
