Scroll speed will depend on it; for example, a BPM200 song at 1x scroll speed and a BPM100 song at 2x scroll speed will have arrows moving at the same speed. Some songs change scroll speed in the middle. They are typically marked with two BPMs if the song actually changes tempo, but if the chart has gimmicks where it speeds up, slows down, or stutters, it may not be shown in the BPM display in the song selection."
