There are many products that can achieve these ends, some of which you probably already have at home. Some great options include:\nCastor oil -- Castor oil contains proteins that encourage growth, but may irritate skin. Olive oil or Coconut oil -- Either of these oils seal in moisture to encourage growth. They are natural and inexpensive. Petroleum jelly -- Petroleum jelly will help seal in moisture. Avoid using petroleum jelly if you have oily or acne-prone skin or you might break out. Eyebrow growth serum -- Growth serums contain vitamins and peptides to encourage growth. These work very well, but it can cost anywhere from $20-80 per bottle."

Put a bit of the product on the back of your wrist or the side of your neck. Wait 4-6 hours. Check to see if there is any redness, irritation, or rash. If there is, discontinue your use of this product. It is best to test each product one at a time, to avoid confusion. Growth serum, castor oil, and petroleum jelly more commonly cause skin irritation than oil or coconut oil, but you could have an allergic reaction to any of them."
