The mixture should be on the thicker side so it doesn\u2019t run. However, feel free to add either more sugar or water as desired to make the paint as thick or thin as you\u2019d like it."

Once combined, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk, plus 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and stir until the paint is evenly mixed. Again, the paint\u2019s consistency is up to you.

For instance, for a holiday-themed picture, you could use red, green, and white glitter and/or food coloring for Christmas, or blue and white for Hannukah.
