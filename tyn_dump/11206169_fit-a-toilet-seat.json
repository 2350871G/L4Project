In this case, use a tape measure to determine the maximum length and width of the seat. Also measure the spacing between the bolts that hold the seat in place (located in the hinges at the back of the seat), and record the distance between the bolts and the toilet tank. Use these measurements when shopping for attachments. Some accessories may instead attach to the mounting bolts, in which case the bolt spacing measurement is of particular importance."

Do the following to remove the seat:\nLift the plastic caps at the back of the seat to expose the heads of the bolts. This is unnecessary if the heads are already visible. Use pliers to loosen the nuts that secure the bolts to the underside of the bowl. If the head of the bolt spins when you do this, insert a screwdriver into the bolt head with your other hand to hold it still. Lift away the seat once you've removed the nuts.
