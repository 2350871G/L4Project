Use a hand mixer to beat the ingredients together until they\u2019re fully combined, which should take 30 seconds to 1 minute. You can use a stand mixer to make the dough if you prefer. You can also stir the dough together by hand, but it will require more time and effort. You can purchase vanilla sugar or make your own by combining 2 cups (400 g) of white sugar with 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract in a sealable plastic bag. Mix until the vanilla is evenly distributed throughout the sugar, and spread the sugar out on a cookie sheet. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes or until it\u2019s dry."
