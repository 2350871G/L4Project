You will need 4 pieces that measure 3 feet (0.91 m) in length, 4 that measure 2 feet (0.61 m), and 4 that measure 6 feet (1.8 m). You will also need one piece of plywood that measures 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2 feet (0.61 m). You can either cut that yourself or purchase a piece of that size from your local hardware store. Always wear eye protection when sawing wood."

Then position a 3 ft (0.91 m) piece perpendicular to it on one side, so the two pieces create the shape of an L. Use screws and a power drill or electric screwdriver to bind the two pieces together in this position. Use screws that are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long to ensure they penetrate through both pieces of wood. You can purchase wood screws at your local hardware store.

        "Once those first 4 screws are in, you and your other friend can let go of the frame.",
        "Then add an additional 3 in (7.6 cm) screw to each corner to ensure it\u2019s secure and stable.",
        "You may be able to use just 1 screw per corner, but 2 will be sturdier.",
        "With the screws in place, the basic frame of the cage is complete.",
        "Lay the plywood down onto the lower frame and secure it with screws.",
        "A rabbit cage should include an area that\u2019s elevated from the ground and offers the rabbits shelter.",
        "Lay a piece of plywood that measures 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2 feet (0.61 m) across the bottom frame on one side.",
        "Then use wood screws to secure it into place.",
        "This step will create a small portion of the cage with an elevated floor.",
        "The remainder of the cage floor will be open to the ground.",
        "Place a rabbit shelter on the plywood.",
        "You can purchase pre-made rabbit shelters from your local pet store, but there are a number of inexpensive alternatives.",
        "Any overturned plastic container with a hole cut for a door can serve as a rabbit shelter for inside your cage.",
        "The shelter will give the rabbits a place to hide from rain or intense sunlight.",
        "It is easier to put the shelter in place before enclosing the cage, but you\u2019ll still be able to access it from the bottom when the cage is complete.",
        "Enclosing the Cage Unroll your screen over the top of the box.",
        "Just about any metal screen or wire chicken fence will do for the sides of your enclosure.",
        "Purchase a roll of your choice in screen material from your local hardware store and then unroll it across the top of your rabbit cage to cover the entire opening.",
        "Choose a screen or mesh material with openings that are smaller than a rabbit will be.",
        "You will need at least 24 feet (7.3 m) of screen material, but you\u2019ll want to purchase a bit more than that to ensure you have slack to work with.",
        "Use a staple gun to secure the screen to the top of the box.",
        "Lay staples across the wire of the screen and into the wooden frame.",
        "Secure the screen to the entire top of the cage by placing a staple every 4 inches (10 cm) or so, while keeping the screen taught across the top.",
        "Be sure to keep the screen pulled tight over the frame as you stable it in place to avoid creating any loose portions a rabbit could escape through.",
        "You can purchase a staple gun and staples at your local hardware store.",
        "Snip away any excess screen material with shears.",
        "Use wire cutters or metal shears to cut the screen that hangs over the sides of the frame away.",
        "Cut the screen so no metal extends beyond the wood; otherwise, it may snag your clothes or scratch you as you walk past the cage.",
        "You can also use pliers to fold any bits of metal extending out from the frame back onto itself so no sharp points are sticking out.",
        "Cut the screen you secured to the top away from the roll so you can use the roll to cover the rest of the cage as well.",
        "Wrap screen around the sides of the box and secure it with staples.",
        "The easiest way to secure the screen to the sides of the cage is to lay the cage frame on its side and roll the screen out over it just as you did with the top.",
        "Staple the screen in place, using one staple every 4 inches (10 cm) or so, then rotate the cage and do the same for the next side.",
        "Repeat this process for all four sides until the cage now has a screen secured over everything but the very bottom.",
        "Cut away any excess material after the screen is secured.",
        "Use your shears or wire cutters to remove all the excess screen material hanging off of the sides you covered.",
        "The cage will not be completely enclosed except for the bottom.",
        "This open bottom is by design, so you can lift the cage up to get to the rabbits rather than installing a door.",
        "If you choose to screen in the bottom of the cage because you\u2019re worried about animals digging their way in or out of the cage, consider zip tying the screen in place so you can remove it and gain access to the interior of the cage when necessary.",
        "Place your rabbits in their new home.",
        "With the cage flat on the ground or floor, lift up the opposite side from the rabbit shelter.",
        "Have a friend hold the cage up while you place your rabbits inside, then carefully lower the cage back down to enclose them in.",
        "To clean the cage, have a friend lift up the end opposite from the rabbit shelter and remove the rabbit.",
        "Then you can turn the cage onto its side or even upside down for easy cleaning.",
        "To give the rabbit food or water in the cage, lift up the same end to slide the bowl in."
