                    "description": "One main aspect about a hipster's style is her ability to look like she stylishly rolled out of bed and threw on the first ensemble she found. Though you shouldn't actually try to do this, you should try to go for a look that makes it look like you didn't spend hours trying to pick the perfect outfit but that you just threw it together at the last minute -- even if that's far from true. Here are some ways to make it look like you just rolled out of bed:\nDon't spend hours styling your hair or it will be too obvious that you put care into your looks. Don't spend hours doing your makeup, either, or it'll look like you put too much effort into your looks again. Don't spend too much time making sure your outfit is \"matchy matchy\" -- the colors can go together, but it shouldn't look too neat or perfect. Don't wear too many articles of clothing that are obviously new."

But if you really want to look like a female hipster, try raiding your mother's (or your grandmother's!) old wardrobe, finding gems at garage sales, or shopping at thrift stores to get that perfect hipster look. Many female hipsters have a more quirky sense of style, looking more tomboyish than super girly. You can also go to stores like Walmart or Target and find plain items that don't look cool, but which are so uncool as to be cool all over again. You can also rip, tear, or add patches to previously un-hip items to dress them up. Do you have a pile of clothes you haven't worn in years collecting dust in the back of your closet? If so, see if you can rescue any of them and make them cool all over again in a retro way."

For shoes, try TOMS, lace-up Vans or Keds, Converse, or ballet flats. Accessories like assorted friendship bracelets, long, chunky necklaces or shorter, \"dainty\" ones.

Don't cake on the foundation and try a little blush to make your cheeks rosy. Stick with earth tones on the eyes and don't go overboard. Definitely stay away from glitters and flashy makeup. A nude lip is great! And if you're going to paint your nails, go with a pale pink, a navy blue, a basic black, or just a layer of clear polish."

Even if you secretly love Beyonce, Lady Gaga, or Britney Spears (gasp! ), you can't talk about them in public.

You don't have to be unfriendly, but you should avoid waving wildly, giving loud hugs, or openly falling into a crying jag in public. To a hipster, everything is \"pretty cool\" or \"just okay\" -- your emotional spectrum shouldn't be too wide. Rolling your eyes, looking at the floor, or languidly checking your phone is a great way to look like you don't care. And try not to crack up, no matter how funny something is -- go for a quick laugh, a chuckle, or even just say \"that's funny\" without cracking a smile."

Be sarcastic to your girlfriend as well as to any guys who come your way, even if they try to ask you out. If you manage your sarcasm the right way, people will be charmed and amused by you. Just don't overdo it, or people will feel like you don't take anything seriously."
