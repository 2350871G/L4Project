Make sure the brush size and shape fit your mouth, which can help reach all areas of your mouth. Buy a proxabrush, or \u201cChristmas tree\u201d brush, if you like.

Setting up specific sections can help you make sure that every surface is properly cleaned. Brush whichever section you want or what makes you most comfortable. Make sure to brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth as well. Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle using gentle pressure. Make sure the brush stays in contact with the surface of your teeth and gum line. Brush from outer to inner tooth surfaces with short strokes and repeat the process for each section of your mouth. Brush the inside surfaces of your front teeth by angling the brush vertically and making several up and down strokes. Pay attention to the surfaces around and in-between your braces, which is where plaque can build up. Brush chewing surfaces, your tongue, and soft palate using a scrubbing motion that gently goes back and forth. Wearing braces means that your gums will always be slightly inflamed, so expect small amounts of bleeding. This is normal."

Use a gentle sawing motion on the side of each tooth. Ask your orthodontist if there is a specific type of floss you should use.
