If you want to make a temporary bolster that can be taken apart at will, use a pillow case and string or safety pins. If you want a permanent bolster, you can use 3/4 yard of the fabric of your choosing and sew it shut. You can also use old towels instead of blankets, if you prefer. No matter which materials you choose to use, make sure that the final product will give you sufficient lift and support as you practice your yoga positions. Blankets may be bulkier than towels, but ultimately either material should work well in a bolster."

However, these may be uncomfortable during certain yoga poses. Another alternative is rubber bands, which can be stretched around the width of the bolster to hold everything in place. Yet another option is to use yarn or string to bind the bolster. Use whichever materials you prefer, or whatever you have on hand."

Lay the filling out flat and roll it up tightly, like a yoga mat. Consider using rubber bands or string to bind the rolled-up filling. This will make it easier to stuff the filling inside your pillow case or cloth, and will also help keep the bolster tight during use. Once the filling is rolled, you'll need to insert it into the sheath. If you're using a pillow case, this should be fairly easy. All you'll need to do is slide the filling inside the pillow case, while retaining the tight wrap of the filling."

If it's too large, you can scale back on your filling. Ultimately, though, the size of the finished product should be determined by your body and your needs. A common size for cylindrical bolsters is 24 inches long by eight inches high. Some yoga practitioners find this height ideal for well-supported forward bends and a deep chest opening. Some yoga practitioners prefer a smaller bolster for supporting the neck, knees, and spine. If you want a smaller bolster, try aiming for 16 inches long and five to six inches high."
