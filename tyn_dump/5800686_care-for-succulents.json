If your variety grows large and top-heavy, aim for a sturdy pot that won't tip over. Terra cotta is a good choice. Make sure the pot has drainage holes at or near the bottom. If you're repurposing a container, avoid glass or other materials that you can't add holes to. Varieties with roots that remain close to the soil surface will thrive in a shallow pot. Those with taproots that penetrate deeply into the soil require a taller pot. Read the care instructions that come with your plant (usually on a plastic tab that sticks in the soil) for details."
