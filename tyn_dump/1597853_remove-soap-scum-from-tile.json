Apply a generous coat of the cleaner to the dirty tile according to the bottle\u2019s instructions. Tile or bathroom cleanser typically comes in two formulas: a liquid or foam spray. A liquid spray is effective on horizontal tile surfaces where you don\u2019t have to worry about it dripping.The foam is often easier to use on tile walls because it stays in place without dripping off. Always read the instructions on a commercial tile or bathroom cleaner before using it on any tile. Before applying the cleaner all over the tile, test it in a small, inconspicuous area to ensure that it won\u2019t damage the tile."
