If your hair isn\u2019t particularly dry, you don\u2019t necessarily need to condition every time you wash your hair.

To remove any film that may be leaving your hair flat, wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo 1 to 2 times a month. It will remove the residue so your hair has more body.

Use the brush to pull up at the roots of your hair and run the dryer along the sections to lock in extra height and body as you\u2019re drying. If you have fine hair, use a round brush with a metal or ceramic core to create the most volume. Keep your dryer on a low to medium setting, and keep moving the dryer around so that your hair doesn\u2019t overheat in any 1 spot. If your hair is fragile, use a brush with a ceramic coating over the core. The ceramic will help distribute the heat more evenly and minimize damage to your hair. You can also substitute velcro rollers for a round brush. Place them at the roots of your hair all around the crown, and blow dry your hair to add volume."
