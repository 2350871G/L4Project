Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds, as the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns. Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. If some of the plums aren\u2019t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them. Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip.

Place the plum on a chopping board and cut around the circumference of the plum. Use a teaspoon to pop the stone out of the plum. Chop both pieces of plum in half. Cut each plum half lengthways to create a wedge. This makes the plum easier to peel.If your plum is particularly large, consider chopping each piece of plum into thirds. Trim the skin off each plum wedge. Press the skin side of the plum firmly down against the chopping board.
