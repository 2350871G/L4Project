When the leather is dry on the bottom side, peel it off the plastic wrap and put it with the opposite side down on the fan of the dehydrator. Dry for 1 to 2 more hours, until it is at your desired consistency. Drying Vegetables Clean and dry your vegetables. Vegetable dehydration is common with gardeners who like to preserve the excesses of their harvest for the winter months. Cut vegetables into uniform slices. Use a mandoline or a meat slicer to achieve this easily. It is important to have uniform slices so that they take the same amount of time to dry. Many vegetables need to be pre-processed in order to avoid a change of color. Steam broccoli, eggplant and carrots for a short time. Blanche summer squash, cauliflower, potatoes, sweet potatoes or carrots until they are soft but still crisp.

Dehydrate using temperatures between 54 and 63 degrees Celsius (130 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit). To create roasted flavors in your peppers, cut them in half, broil them until they start to blister, cool and then dehydrate them skin side down. Dehydrate garlic and onions separately. Other vegetables will absorb the flavor if you dry them together. Drying Meat Cut meat into thin strips to make jerky.  Choose a meat marinade. Most recipes have a high salt content combined with combination black pepper, brown sugar and sauces. Mix the marinade ingredients separately. Spread the marinade generously, on all surfaces of the meat. Store in a covered glass dish for 12 hours. Place strips on the dehydrator racks, without overlapping. Dry for 4 hours at 60 to 70 degrees Celsius (140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit). Check jerky. Dry for the remainder of the time at 54 degrees Celsius (130 degrees Fahrenheit). Jerky is done when it cracks, not breaks, when you bend it. Jerky will last between 1 and 2 months, but can be frozen to last longer. Drying Herbs Wash and dry your herbs. Remove thick stems. Place your herbs on the drying rack without overlapping. If you are drying seeds, place them on cheesecloth in the dehydrator. Dry for 4 hours or less. Check the herbs often, as they are delicate. When they are crisp and dry, remove them. Store in an airtight container for use up to a year after they are dry.",
