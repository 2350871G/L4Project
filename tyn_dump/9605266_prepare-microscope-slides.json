Dry mounts are the simplest to prepare, since they do not use any liquid between the slide and the specimen. A dry mount is ideal for inspecting samples that are not at risk of drying out. Materials that are commonly dry mounted include:\nCork or balsa wood. Flower petals or leaves. Insect legs or wings. Hair, fur, or feathers."

If you are using a concave slide (in which one side dips down), place the specimen in the center of the concave area. Mount the specimen on a concave slide if you\u2019re concerned that the specimen will roll or slide off the flat slide. For example, use a concave slide if you\u2019re preparing a curled flower petal that rolls to one side or the other. For all other types of specimens, a flat slide will work fine."

Cover slips are very thin, transparent pieces of glass or, more commonly, plastic. Each slip is about \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) in both width and length.
