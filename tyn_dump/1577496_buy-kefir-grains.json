            "description": "Fresh kefir grains are the preferred choice for people who prepare kefir regularly. These grains can be continually propagated with minimal effort, so you only ever need to buy them once. Powdered cultures, consisting of dormant yeast and bacteria, are a more convenient option that can be stored easily and do not have to be monitored. However, the powdered form does expire and needs to be repurchased periodically."

            "description": "If you know anyone living in your area that makes kefir, he or she will almost certainly be willing to give you some kefir grains at no cost. Kefir cultures grow aggressively, so anyone maintaining one will be constantly sloughing off excess. Asking a friend to give you this excess is the easiest way to obtain fresh kefir grains."
