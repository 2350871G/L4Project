            "description": "These are prevalent, because the majority of the wholesale electronics market has moved online. Watch out for these common scams as you look for bulk laptops. Don't use any website that charges a membership fee, monthly fee or annual fee to buy electronics in bulk. Setup or other superfluous fees are likely to be a sign that the company is trying to get your financial information. You should not be paying them unless you directly purchase goods. One caveat is that if a wholesale distribution center is finding bulk laptops for you, they may ask for a deposit, which will later be used to pay part of your balance. Sending a check or PayPal payment will ensure they don't have your bank account details. Beware of drop shipping scams. In this practice, you believe you are communicating with a wholesaler, but you are actually talking with a middleman who plans to use you to get clients, and arrange payment with themselves directly. Many people are fooled with \"work from home opportunities\" that leave them paying service fees and not making any money. Sites that claim to be independent review sites are rarely independent. Companies pay to put up these sites that rate the products that earn them the highest commission as the best. Do not base your purchase on these sites."

In an escrow transaction, the money or bond is kept by a third party until the transaction is successfully completed. This is usually kept by banks or lending agencies who hold a bond for the wholesaler. DHGate is another wholesaler that connects worldwide laptop suppliers. Although they don't advertise escrow transactions, some products come with a 7-day return or exchange guarantee. Look for this guarantee before purchasing in bulk."
