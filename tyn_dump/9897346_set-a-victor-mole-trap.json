If you have multiple mounds around your lawn, put a hole in each of them to discover all the active tunnels. Dig a hole in the top of an active tunnel. Pick a tunnel that's been covered by a mole, and dig a hole in the top of the tunnel with a spade. The hole should be about 6 inches (15 cm) wide and penetrate down into the mole tunnel.
