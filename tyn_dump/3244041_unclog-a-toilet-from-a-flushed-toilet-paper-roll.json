Plunging the Toilet to Dislodge the Toilet Paper Roll Make sure there\u2019s enough water in the toilet bowl.

Submerge the bell end of the plunger into the toilet bowl until it reaches the hole at the bottom. The plunger should fit securely directly over the opening. Make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps between the sides of the plunger and the drain opening. Press the plunger gently to release the trapped air. At the bell end of the plunger is a small pocket of air that needs to be released to create a good suction seal. Once you fit the plunger over the drain opening, gently press on the plunger to collapse the bell end of the plunger and push out the trapped air. This will also prevent water from splashing back at you when you plunge the toilet. Push and pull on the handle of the plunger 15 to 20 times. Press the plunger in and out vigorously while keeping the seal with the drain opening. The suction from the plunger will dislodge the toilet paper roll.
