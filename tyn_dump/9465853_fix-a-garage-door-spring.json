Use locking pliers or a C-clamp to secure the door to the track to keep it from opening when you release the tension on the springs. Loosen the set screws while holding each spring with a winding bar. Position a sturdy ladder to the side of the springs, rather than working directly in front of them, for safety reasons.

Position the second winding bar into a hole on the winding cone at a perpendicular angle to the first. Unwind the spring \u00bc turn at a time, moving 1 winding bar to the next open perpendicular position after each \u00bc turn. Repeat on the other spring. Remove the nuts and bolts, then slide the springs to the end bracket. Using a wrench, remove the 2 nuts and bolts that secure each spring cone to the center bracket. Then, slide each spring toward the end bracket. Secure the tube and remove the springs, cables, and cable drums. Use locking pliers or a C-clamp to secure the torsion tube to the center bracket to keep it from moving. Then, use a wrench to loosen the set screws on both lift cable drums. Disconnect the lift cables, then slide the cable drums and springs off the torsion tube. Securing the tube is an essential step that will prevent the tube from moving around and potentially injuring you, so be sure to fully lock the tube in place.

For instance, if you spot a frayed cable, replace it now to avoid taking the door apart again later. Installing the New Springs Slide the left spring onto the tube and add the cable drum. When your new springs arrive, put the new left spring (the 1 with the end facing up and to the left) on the torsion tube, making sure that the stationary cone on the end of the spring faces the center bracket. After sliding the new spring into place, replace the cable drum and insert the torsion bar into the left bearing bracket. Install the center bearing and the right spring, then secure the cones. Slide the torsion bar to the left then add the center bearing. Slide the right spring onto the bar and press the bearing into the stationary cone. Connect both of the stationary cones to the center bracket with the nuts and bolts you removed previously. Remove the locking pliers or clamp from the center bracket. Thread the cables and tighten the drums. Run the lift cable between the roller and the doorjamb. Slip the lift cable stop through the cable slot on the drum. Then, attach locking pliers to the torsion tube to secure it in place. Spin the drum to wind the cable into the grooves, then tighten the set screws. Repeat on the other side, leaving the locking pliers in place. For the door to operate properly, you need the same amount of tension on both sides, so take care to tighten each side evenly.

Tightening the screws more than this could distort or puncture the torsion tube, so be sure to make less than 1 full rotation once the screws touch the torsion tube. Lubricate the springs. Slide a grocery bag or piece of cardboard behind the spring to protect the garage door. Spray each spring with garage door lubricant. Wipe off any excess, then repeat the process on the other side. Remove the clamps or pliers. It is now safe to remove the clamps or pliers you used to hold both the torsion bar and the garage door itself in place. Test the door and reconnect the opener. Lift the door up about 3 feet (0.91 m) high and let it go. If it stays in place, you did the job correctly. If it doesn\u2019t, add a \u00bc turn to each spring.

        "Stretch the springs out \u20444 inch (0.64 cm).",
        "When the spring is fully wound, leave 1 winding bar in a slot of the cone that is perpendicular to the floor.",
        "Tap the winding bar with a hammer to stretch the spring \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) out from the center.",
        "Repeat on the other side.",
        "Tighten the set screws.",
        "Use your fingers to tighten each set screw until it contacts the torsion tube.",
        "Then, tighten each screw \u00bd to \u00be turn more.",
        "Tightening the screws more than this could distort or puncture the torsion tube, so be sure to make less than 1 full rotation once the screws touch the torsion tube.",
        "Lubricate the springs.",
        "Slide a grocery bag or piece of cardboard behind the spring to protect the garage door.",

        "Test the door and reconnect the opener.",
        "Lift the door up about 3 feet (0.91 m) high and let it go.",
        "If it stays in place, you did the job correctly.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t, add a \u00bc turn to each spring.",
        "Test the door again and add another \u00bc turn if necessary.",
