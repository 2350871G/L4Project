In addition to seasoning the meat, the oil and salt make it easier for the fat to render out, resulting in crispier skin. Apply the seasonings by hand, and work the salt and pepper into the slits across the skin. Note that salt and pepper should withstand the roasting process without deteriorating, but other spices and herbs might burn.
