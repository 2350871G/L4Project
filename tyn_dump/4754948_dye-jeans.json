        "This is for just 1 pound (500 g) of jeans.",
        "For jeans weighing more than that, double the amount of salt and water.",
        "While not absolutely necessary, it would be a good idea to add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap.",
        "This will help the dye adhere better.",
        "Soak your jeans in the dye for 30 to 60 minutes, stirring often.",
        "Place the jeans into the water, then push down on them with the wooden stick to ensure that they're submerged.",
        "Let them soak for 30 to 60 minutes.",
        "Every 10 minutes or so, give the dye bath a good stir.",
        "If you\u2019re using the stove-top method, make sure that the water is still just under a boil.",
        "Don't turn the stove off.",
        "Stirring the jeans is important; otherwise, the dye will come out splotchy.",
        "Take the jeans out of the bucket and squeeze out the dye.",
        "If the color still isn't dark enough, put the jeans back into the dye bath and let them soak for another 30 minutes or so.",
        "Keep in mind that the jeans will appear lighter after they dry.",
        "If you\u2019re dyeing the jeans longer, remember to stir them every 10 minutes or so.",
        "Take them out of the dye bath and squeeze out the excess dye.",
        "Rinse the jeans until the water runs clear.",
        "Start with warm water, then lower the temperature as the dye rinses out.",
        "Once the water runs clear, rinse the jeans one last time using cool water.",
        "It would be easier to do this in a tub, but you can use a bucket too.",
        "If you choose to use the bucket, change the water time after you dunk the jeans, take them out, and squeeze them.",
        "Wash the jeans with a gentle detergent.",
        "Read the instructions on the care tag inside your jeans to find out how you should wash them.",
        "Most jeans are machine-washable, but some must be hand-washed.",
        "In most cases, expect to use cool water and a gentle cycle.",
        "Wash the jeans separately or with similar colors.",
        "Even though you rinsed the jeans until the water ran clear, there might still be some dye left.",
        "The dye may fade a little in the wash.",
        "If you're worried about this, turn the jeans inside-out first.",
        "Allow the jeans to hang dry.",
        "You can speed the process up in the dryer, but this is not recommended because it can damage the jeans.",
        "Alternatively, dry the jeans part-way in the dryer, then hang them up to finish air-drying.",
        "Don't leave the jeans in the dryer for a full cycle.",
        "Use a half cycle instead.",
        "This could be anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Dyeing Jeans in a Washing Machine Fill the washing machine with hot water.",
        "Set the washing machine to the hottest water cycle available.",
        "Turn the machine on and allow it to fill up.",
        "You don't have to wait for it to finish filling before moving on to the next step.",
        "This method is not recommended if you are using a public laundry room.",
        "The residue might ruin the next person's laundry.",
        "A top-loading water will work the best, but you can use a front-loading washer too.",
        "In this case, don't let it fill with water yet.",
        "Pour the dye into the barrel of the washing machine.",
        "Start with half a bottle of dye, which amounts to about \u20442 cup (120 mL).",
        "If you're dyeing the jeans a dark color, then use a full bottle of dye instead.",
        "If your jeans weigh more than 1 pound (500 g), double the amount of dye.",
        "For a front-loading machine, pour the dye into the detergent dispenser, then add 1 cup (240 mL) of water to flush it.",
        "Stir 1 cup (273 g) of salt into the water.",
        "Read the instructions on the back of the dye first.",
        "Most brands of dye require 1 cup (273 g) of salt for every 1 pound (55 g) of fabric.",
        "Some brands, however, don't require any salt.",
        "Agitate the dye and salt with a wooden stick or run the washer for a few minutes.",
        "Some people like to add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap into the dye bath as well.",
        "This helps the dye adhere more evenly.",
        "For a front-loading machine, let it run for 10 minutes first, then add 1 cup (273 g) of salt dissolved in 4 cups (950 mL) of hot water into the detergent dispenser.",
        "Flush it with 4 cups (950 mL) of hot water.",
        "Place the jeans into the washer and let it run through 1 cycle.",
        "Set the jeans into the washer, making sure that they are completely submerged.",
        "Close the washer, and run a cycle.",
        "Depending on the care tag's instructions, use either a normal or delicate cycle.",
        "Don't change the water temperature, even if the care tag inside the jeans tells you to wash them with cold water.",
        "A single wash with hot water won't ruin your jeans.",
        "It's only when you wash them every time with hot water that they start to wear down.",
        "Run a second rinse cycle using cold water, then take the jeans out.",
        "As soon as the cycle is complete, run a second cycle.",
        "This time, use the cold water and rinse-only setting to remove the excess dye.",
        "Once you take the jeans out, run a third cycle in the empty washing machine.",
        "This will get rid of residue and keep your next load of laundry clean.",
        "Spread the jeans out flat to dry or hang them up instead.",
        "This is the safest way to dry your jeans as the dryer can damage them.",
        "If you're in a hurry, however, you could toss them into a dry and let them dry halfway, then hang them up to allow them to finish drying.",
        "How long it takes for the jeans to dry halfway depends on the strength of your dryer.",
        "This shouldn't be more than 15 to 20 minutes, or so, however."
