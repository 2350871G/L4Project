Wear red, lavender, turquoise and pale pink with beige and tan clothes and accessories. Wear bright green, red, yellow and pink with navy tops and shoes. Try a long, open cardigan. A neutral or patterned cardigan will be comfortable and professional. Try pairing a navy or black polka dot cardigan with bright red pants. Buy a peplum top. The skirted top fans out over skinny or straight-legged pants, showing off curves. Choose a top in a neutral shade or a complimentary shade. Wear with a button down. A simply white button down shirt is a classic look with colored pants. For an extra preppy look, throw on a form fitting crew neck sweater in a coordinating color and let the tails and collar pop out. Casual Colored Pants Pick your favorite color when you choose colored pants. They may rest in the back of the closet if it\u2019s an on-trend color that you don\u2019t wear often. You will have more options if you can coordinate some matching hues with your current wardrobe. Choose the neon colored pants and denim for casual outfits, rather than work clothes. They may not earn you the right kind of attention at work, but they are ideal for sunny days and barhopping. Try a monochromatic look. Pair pastel jeans with a brighter top in the same color. For example a pale pink with a strawberry top. Finish the look with neutral or metallic shoes. Alternatively, pair bright jeans with a pastel top in the same color. Color block your outfit. Combining bright colored pants with bright colored tops is the latest style. Try green with red, blue with orange or purple with yellow to take advantage of complimentary colors. This look can be as daring as you want to make it, which is why it is ideal for after work or weekends. Wear colored pants with denim shirts. Chambray shirts are gaining in popularity, and they are ideally paired with black or colored jeans. Take full advantage of this trend by wearing a cropped denim jacket over your outfit. Cut your colored denim into cutoffs. If you bought the wrong length of pants for your body type, turn it into a summer outfit by cutting at or above the mid-thigh. Pair with tank tops, t-shirts and peplum tops. Accessorizing Colored Pants Wear heels with straight or skinny colored pants. Ankle jeans are especially suited to a neutral heel. The heels will also make you look taller and more svelte. Men can combine colored pants with neutral oxfords, loafers and low boots to dress up their colored pants. Consider patterned ballet shoes or heels for an extra burst of color. Stripes, chevrons, animal prints and floral patterns look splashy next to a bright color. Choose a pattern that has the pants color in them or opt for a black and white pattern. Pick gold or silver accessories. Pair warm colors, like pink, yellow, red and orange with gold. Pair cooler colors, like cobalt, green, purple and grey with silver belts, earrings, bracelets and necklaces. Use a bag in a similar shade. If you have teal jeans, try an aqua bag.
