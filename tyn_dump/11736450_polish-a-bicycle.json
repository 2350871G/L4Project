This makes the bike easier to polish, but you can definitely get your bike frame looking great without disassembling it.Tip: Taking a bike apart and reassembling it later is pretty time consuming, and it can be hard to put it back together perfectly if you don\u2019t know how to piece it back together. If you aren\u2019t comfortable disassembling a bike, don\u2019t worry about it! If you want to clean the metal components, wipe them down with a degreaser and clean them separately. Once you reinstall the chain, use an oil lubricant designed for bikes to re-oil the chain."
