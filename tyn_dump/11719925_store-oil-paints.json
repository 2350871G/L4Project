                    "description": "A wood palette will absorb oil paint and remove the moisture that keeps the pigment activated. This will dry your oil paint out quickly. A plastic palette is better than wood, but it is still more porous than glass and your paint won\u2019t last as long. Stick with a glass palette when using oil paints to ensure that the moisture stays in your paint for as long as possible. They also have the added benefit of looking much cooler than regular palettes! If you sit down while painting, you can use a regular pane of glass instead of a palette. Be sure to put a towel underneath your palette or glass to ensure that you don\u2019t scratch your table, though. Oil paint will dry on a glass palette in roughly 12 hours. On a plastic palette, it may last for 16-18 hours. A glass palette should keep your paint wet for at least 24 hours. These drying times depend on the temperature, light, and humidity in your workspace, though."

                    "description": "To store your colors individually, tear off a 6 in (15 cm) rectangle of aluminum foil for each color you\u2019re storing. Use a palette knife to scoop your paint up and scrape the knife into the middle of the aluminum foil. Fold the foil around the glob of paint by wrapping the edges over the center of the foil. Do not apply pressure to the package of foil or flatten it out. Your oil paints will stay wet for 4-5 days in the aluminum foil.To keep track of your colors, scrape a little bit of the paint on top of each package of aluminum foil. This is a great option if you work on multiple paintings at one time and want to store specific colors next to the painting they belong with. It\u2019s also the best way to preserve that perfect shade you spent time mixing up since there\u2019s no risk of your paint mixing with other colors nearby."

                    "description": "Clove oil is an essential oil that comes from clove plants, and it\u2019s often used for toothaches and aromatherapy. Use a palette knife or brush to mix 5-10 drops of clove oil into each color on your easel. The clove oil will keep your paint nice and soft while you aren\u2019t using it, and your paint will stay wet if you leave it uncovered for 4-5 days.Variation: You can soak a sponge in clove oil and place it in an airtight case with your easel if you don\u2019t want to mix anything directly into the paint. This will keep your paint wet for 3-5 days depending on how much air is in the container. Some artists are suspicious of clove oil and avoid using it because they think it changes the shades of their colors over time. If you don\u2019t want the colors to change, clove oil may not be the best option for you. You can buy clove oil online or at your local pharmacy."

Use additional lengths as needed to cover any gaps and keep air out. Then, put your palette in the refrigerator. Your paint will stay wet in the fridge for 3-5 days.When you take your paint out of the refrigerator to get back to work, let the palette sit out for 30-45 minutes to give the paints time to reach room temperature.

These tubes are typically pretty large and you can store several ounces of paint in them. For an easier alternative, you can scoop the paint into any airtight glass or metal container.
