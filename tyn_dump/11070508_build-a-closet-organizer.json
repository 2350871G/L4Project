        "Building the Shelves Cut the shelves and sides of your organizer out of plywood or MDF.",
        "Transfer the measurements from the layout you chose and draw them on a sheet of plywood or MDF using a straightedge.",
        "Cut along the lines you drew with a circular saw until you have all of the pieces you need for your shelves.",
        "You can cut the sides as tall as they need to be, but aim for about 12\u201314 inches (30\u201336 cm) deep if you want to store folded clothes on them.",
        "Wear safety glasses whenever you work with power tools.",
        "You can make your shelves as wide or narrow as you want as long as they store the items you need.",
        "Ask the employees where you bought the plywood or MDF to see if they can cut it to size for you.",
        "Mark where you want to put shelves along the length of the side pieces.",
        "Lay one of the sides of your organizer down on your work surface and measure where you want to place shelves based on the layout you drew.",
        "Aim to leave at least 12\u201315 inches (30\u201338 cm) between the shelves so you can easily store piles of clothes or stacks of items inside.",
        "Draw a straight line on the side with a pencil.",
        "Make sure your lines are the same on each side of the organizer so your shelves hang level.",
        "Check that all your lines are straight and level when you\u2019re building your organizer, or else the shelves could hang crooked.",
        "Adjust the distance between the shelves based on how much space you have in your closet and what items you\u2019re storing on them.",
        "If you have specific items that you want to store on your shelves, measure them to see how tall they are so you can space your shelves accordingly.",
        "Predrill holes through the sides of the organizer.",
        "Use a drill bit that\u2019s about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) smaller than the screws you plan on using to hold your organizer together.",
        "Make holes every 5 inches (13 cm) along the lines you drew on the sides.",
        "Drill through the sides completely so the wood doesn\u2019t chip or break when you screw it together.",
        "If you don\u2019t predrill the side pieces, the screws are more likely to go crooked or chip the surface of the organizer.",
        "If you don\u2019t want your screws visible when your organizer is built, you can use pocket holes instead.",
        "Otherwise, you can use wood filler to hide the screws.Tip: Clamp the 2 side pieces together and drill through them both at the same time to ensure your holes are in the same place on each piece.",
        "Attach the shelves into the sides of the organizer with building screws.",
        "Hold the side of the organizer so the long edge rests on your work surface, and line up a shelf piece along one of the marks you drew.",
        "Put a building screw in one of the holes you drilled and use an electric screwdriver to tighten it.",
        "Hold the shelf piece securely while you\u2019re drilling so it doesn\u2019t move around.",
        "Continue screwing in all the shelves on one side of the organizer before attaching the second side in the same way.",
        "Check the shelves with a level before screwing them into the second side piece to ensure they aren\u2019t crooked.",
        "Go slow while you\u2019re attaching the screws so you don\u2019t accidentally chip or break the shelves.",
        "Use metal brackets to hold the organizer against the closet walls.",
        "Screw in at least 2 metal brackets on the bottoms of the top and middle shelves.",
        "Find the studs on the back of your closet wall and use screws to mount the brackets onto the walls.",
        "That way, your organizer won\u2019t fall forward if it gets too heavy.",
        "You can either have your closet organizer rest on the floor or you can mount it off the ground.",
        "If you mount it off the ground, make sure the brackets are rated to support the weight of the organizer and the items you\u2019re putting on it.",
        "You may need more brackets depending on how heavy the items in your organizer are.",
        "Installing a Clothes Rod Space your rod far enough from your walls so you can fit hangers on it.",
        "Hold the corner of a hanger against the back of your closet to determine how much space you need.",
        "Aim to have a 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) gap between the corner of the hanger and the wall.",
        "Mark your wall or organizer where the hook of the hanger is so you know where to install your rod.",
        "Make sure your marks are level with one another so the rod doesn\u2019t hang crooked.",
        "You don\u2019t need to install a clothes rod if you don\u2019t want one.Tip: You can either hang a rod between the sides of the organizer, or you can attach it to the outside of your organizer so the rod runs toward the wall.",
        "Cut or adjust the clothes rod so it\u2019s \u20448 in (0.32 cm) shorter than the space.",
        "Measure the distance of the space you want your curtain rod to span.",
        "If you\u2019re using a wooden rod, use a handsaw or circular saw to cut the rod.",
        "Many store-bought clothes rods are adjustable, so follow the directions to change the length.",
        "Keep the rod \u20448 in (0.32 cm) smaller than the distance you measured so you have room to install the brackets.",
        "I\nReuse the old rod from your closet if it had one and you don\u2019t plan on using it again.",
        "Install a rod mounting bracket on one side of the organizer.",
        "A rod mounting bracket usually has a hook or slot where you can easily set in the clothes rod.",

        "Use a level to make sure your mounting brackets are in line with one another a final time before securing it in place.",
        "Use an electric screwdriver to secure the second bracket in place.",
        "Put your rod in the mounting brackets and secure them if you need to.",
        "Lift up the rod and set one end of the rod into one of the brackets.",
        "Then guide the other side of the rod into the second bracket.",
        "Some brackets hold the rod loosely while others may have you screw the rod in.",
        "Check your mounting brackets and screw the rod in if you need to.",
        "Once your rod is in place, it\u2019s ready to use.",
        "Use multiple clothes rods if you want to further organize your hanging clothes.",
        "For example, you could use one of the rods for formal shirts or dresses and the other for casual sweatshirts.",
        "Adding Additional Features Build drawers if you want to easily pull out items.",
        "Mark out which shelves you want to install drawers on and measure the insides of their compartments.",
        "Install drawer slides on the sides of your shelves so you can pull your drawers out.",
        "Build the frames for the drawers and attach the other sides of the slides to them.",
        "Push the drawers into the shelves so the slides catch onto one another.",
        "Drawers work great for storing things that could easily fall off of shelves, such as socks.",
        "You can also use drawer slides to make open racks for shoes or pants.Tip: Use collapsible storage cubes if you don't want to build your own drawers.",
        "Put cabinet doors on your organizer to hide your belongings.",
        "You can either use prebuilt cabinet doors or you can make them yourself.",
        "Cut the doors to the size of your shelves so they cover the entire opening.",
        "Install hinges on the sides of your shelves so you can easily hang the doors.",
        "Make sure the doors are level when you attach them to the shelves or else they may be crooked.",
        "You can install any handles you want on your cabinet doors to match the rest of your room\u2019s decorations.",
        "Add hooks to the side of your organizer if you want to easily hang hats or ties.",

        "Screw the hooks into the outsides of your organizer so you can grab your items easily.",
        "Use adhesive-backed mounting hooks if you want a cheap and removable option.",
        "Install a pull-out ironing board so you can smooth out wrinkled clothes.",
        "Look at your local home goods store or online for wall-mounted folding ironing boards and see if one will fit inside your closet.",
