    "text": " Creating Rippling, Horizontal Waves Apply a heat protectant to dry, brushed hair. Comb your hair first to remove any knots or tangles. Apply a heat protectant and comb through your hair once more to distribute the product. Pull your hair into a half-up bun, if needed. If you have very thick hair, you might find it easier to curl it if it is divided into 2 layers. To do this, simply gather the upper half of your hair, just like you would for a half-up ponytail. Twist the hair into a loose bun, then secure it with a hair clip. Clamp a flat iron over a 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) section of hair. Gather a 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide section of hair from next to your face. Clamp a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide flat iron over the section, close to your roots. Rotate the iron upwards and pull the rest of your hair downward. Hold the iron clamped shut as you rotate it upwards towards your roots. Use your other hand to gather the end of the section, and pull it straight down. Hold the iron there for a few seconds. Move the iron down, clamp it, and rotate it downward. Unclamp the iron and move it down a few inches/centimeters until you reach the next, un-straightened section of hair. Clamp it over that section and rotate the iron downwards, towards your jaw. Pull the rest of your hair upwards, and hold it like that for a few seconds. Repeat this process until you reach the end of your hair. Try to keep the motion fluid and rotating back and forth, creating a ripple or wave with your hand. You can also leave the bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) untouched for a more natural look. Repeat the process for the rest of your hair. Continue to work in 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) sections of hair, from 1 side of your face to the other. If you split your hair into 2 layers, finish the bottom layer first, then do the upper layer. Work 1 section of hair at a time, rippling the iron through each section.. Let your hair cool before combing it. You can use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb for this. Do not use a hairbrush, or it will smooth out the curls too much and make your hair turn frizzy. Add some texture with dry shampoo, from roots to ends. This will also help give you a little extra volume while absorbing the excess oils. If you want a more authentic, beachy look, you can mist some sea salt spray or beach spray as well. This will give you that natural, dirty look your hair gets after a day at the beach. Be careful when using sea salt or beach spray, as these products are wet and can flatten your waves. Creating Corkscrew Curls with a Flat Iron Apply a heat protectant to clean, dry, combed hair. Wash your hair, if needed, then blow dry it. Brush out any knots or tangles, then apply a good heat protectant. Comb through your hair once more to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair. Clip the top section of your hair out of the way. Part your hair in half at ear-level, like doing a half-up ponytail. Twist the upper section of your hair into a loose bun and secure it with a clip or hair tie. Take a 1 in (2.5 cm) section of hair from next to your face. Instead of grabbing a horizontal section that is parallel to the floor, grab a vertical section instead. If you have thin hair, or if you want looser waves, you could try a 2 in (5.1 cm) section instead. Clamp a flat iron over the section. Make sure that the flat iron is oriented vertically so that it is perpendicular to the floor, not parallel. The hair will end up draped diagonally across the metal plate instead of straight down the middle. You can have the handle pointing up or down, whichever is more comfortable for you. Twist the flat iron away from your face while pulling it down. This should be a single, fluid motion. Twist the iron away from your face by about 180 degrees. While you are twisting it, pull it towards the end of your hair. Your hair should pass over the center of the iron and around one of the plates. For a more authentic beachy look, pull the iron only three-quarters of the way down. This will leave the ends of your hair their natural texture. This motion is similar to straightening your hair, except that you are twisting the iron instead of holding it straight and parallel to the floor. Repeat the process for the rest of your hair. Continue grabbing and curling 1 in (2.5 cm) sections of hair. Alternate between twisting the iron towards and away from your face. When you reach the other side of your head, twist the iron away from your face. Finish the bottom layer of hair first, then do the upper layer. For a final touch, consider straightening just the ends of your hair. This will help give your beach waves that natural, authentic look. Let your hair cool, then comb it. You can use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to do this, but don't use a hairbrush, or you'll end up with frizz! This will help break up the waves and make them look more natural.

Run your fingers or a wide-toothed comb through your hair to loosen the waves. Using Twists or Braids Brush your hair and apply heat protectant. Comb your hair until it is free of knots and tangles, then apply a good heat protectant. Comb through your hair once more to evenly distribute the product throughout your hair. This method will give you waves that are either vertical (twists) or horizontal (braids). Pull the upper half of your hair into a bun, if desired. If you have very thick hair, it may be easier to curl it in layers. Simply part your hair at about ear level, like creating a half-up ponytail, then pull the upper layer into a loose bun. Secure the bun with a clip or hair tie. Take a thick chunk of hair from next to your face. Mentally divide your hair into thirds, like starting a braid. Take 1 of the outer sections from next to your face; leave the other 2 sections alone. If you have thin hair, part your hair down the middle like doing pigtails. Part the section in half again, and choose 1 of those sections to start with. If you plan to braid your hair instead of twisting it, it is better to do 2 sections instead of 3. If you do too many, your hair will look crimped instead. Twist the chunk away from your face into a tight rope. Twirl the section around your finger until it twists into a rope. Alternatively, you can split the section into 3 strands, then braid them together. Hold the rope or braid tightly at the end. Leave the bottom 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of your hair untwisted/unbraided. Clamp a flat iron over the rope and straighten it. Turn your flat iron to a setting suitable for your hair. Clamp it over the rope or braid, close to the roots. Slowly move the flat iron down the length of the rope or braid towards the end. Do this a few times until the rope or braid feels warm. Clip the rope or braid out of the way. Pull the end of your rope or braid towards your head to make a loop. Secure it to the start of the rope or braid, right at the roots, with a hair clip. A duckbill clip will work especially well here because it won't leave creases in your hair. Keep the rope or braid intact. Don't let it come untwisted or unbraided. Repeat the process with the rest of your hair. Work your way from 1 side of your head to the other. If you gathered the upper half of your hair into a bun, finish the lower layer first, then undo the bun and repeat the process with the upper layer. If you are twisting your hair into ropes, alternate the directions you twist them in. When you reach the other side of your head, twist the hair away from your face. Allow your hair to set until it is completely cool. How long this takes depends on your hair and how hot your flat iron was. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 15 minutes. Take advantage of the wait time and continue to get ready for the day, such as putting on jewelry or make up. Remove the clips and undo the ropes or braids. Starting from the bottommost layer, remove the clips 1 by 1. Use your fingers to undo the ropes or braids, then do the upper layer. Mist your hair with dry shampoo and sea salt spray. Apply the dry shampoo to your hair first, then gently comb it through your hair with your fingers. This will help soak up any excess oils and give your hair some texture. Apply some sea salt or beach spray next to give it that final, beachy texture.",
