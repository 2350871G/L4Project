If you live in the USA, you must make an 811 \u201cDigline\u201d call and set up a time to have your property inspected to determine the location of underground utility pipes and cables before starting any digging project.

Understand that curved retaining walls with tongues may not benefit from the interlocking grooves. These grooves will need to be cut off with a hammer and chisel if the layout of the pattern does not fit the direction of the grooves. Use coarse sand and a rubber mallet to level off the first layer of blocks. This will complete the entire foundation. If you took the time to level off the bed, laying the first row should be easy. Use coarse sand where necessary to get a level finish on your foundation. Hammer the blocks down with your rubber mallet. Cut individual blocks to complete the first layer, if necessary. Simply mark them at the appropriate length and cut with a mason's saw. Always use proper protection when cutting. Use crushed stone or gravel for backfill on your first layer of blocks. This will provide excellent support, keeping your bottom layer from slipping back with time and erosion. Place a filter fabric over the backfill. This will prevent frost heave and keeps the soil from mixing with the backfill. Depending on how tall your retaining wall is, you may want to drape the filler along the back side of the trench or house, fill the trench with backfill until it's anchored the filter fabric down, and then drape the fabric flat out, on top of the backfill. Sweep the first layer with a broom. This will free up any dirt or dust. Completing the Wall Start your second layer with a staggered pattern. This is so that the top layer seams are offset with the bottom layer. You want each layer of blocks to be different from the one below it. For example, if the wall has straight edges on the ends, the next layer should start with a block that has been cut in half. Place the blocks onto the foundation before applying the adhesive. See how they look; ask yourself whether you need to make any significant cuts before gluing . Lay out one whole row before moving on to the next step. If you're working with blocks that have flanged tongues, simply line up the female groove of the top block with the male groove of the bottom block. Apply the recommended adhesive to the bottom blocks, once a layer has been provisionally laid out. Next, fit the top block overhead. Press down to make sure that each layer is secured tightly against the layer beneath it. Continue until retaining wall is its preferred height. If your wall is over 3 ft (.91 m) in height, you should offset each new row slightly back from the row below it, like very shallow stair steps. This will make your wall more stable and help create a better hold with the soil once you backfill. Add drainage pipes to your retaining wall, if the wall is 2 feet (60 cm) or taller. Look for a perforated pipe and lay it down the length of the retaining wall, covering it up with breathable backfill. Make sure water can drain out of your pipe, either at the ends or through an outlet in the middle of the wall. Add topper stones, if desired. Topper stones usually come in rectangular shapes, making them more difficult to install in curved retaining walls. If you need to cut topper stones to fit the curve in your retaining wall, follow this trick:\nLay stones #1 and #3 out in their pattern. Lay stone #2 on top of #1 and #3, drawing lines on #1 and #3 where stone #2 overlaps them. Cut stones #1 and #3 along those lines. Line up #1 and #3 into place, snugging #2 in between.
