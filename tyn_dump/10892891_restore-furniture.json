If your furniture is very grimy, try wiping it down with mineral spirits, but make sure you work in a well-ventilated area. Otherwise, a simple combination of dish soap and water is a perfectly good cleaning solution. To use dish detergent, mix a healthy amount into a large bucket of water. Dip in a sponge, then lightly rub down your piece of furniture. Take care not to soak the wood, and dry it thoroughly. For a more aggressive approach, soak a cloth with mineral spirits so it\u2019s wet, but not dripping. Wipe the furniture down in a well-ventilated area, taking care not to touch your mouth or eyes. Wipe off any remaining mineral spirits with a wet cloth to finish."

Brush on a thick coat with an old paintbrush before allowing it to sit for as long as the label instructs. Then, wipe it down with a cloth soaked in neutralizer, which will stop the paint stripper from continuing to corrode the existing finish. Scrape the congealed paint stripper off with a putty knife or stripping tool, pushing it away from you while prying the residue up from underneath. If you\u2019re working with a large piece of furniture, apply the paint stripper to one portion of it at a time and scrape it off before applying it to another area. If you coat the entirety of a large piece of furniture, parts of it may become too dry before you get around to scraping them. Use a metal wire brush to scrape congealed paint stripper from detailed nooks and crannies. When stripping fine detail work, it may also help to apply several coats of paint stripper before removing it. This will loosen the paint more effectively and make it easier to remove from hard-to-reach places. Make sure to use the kind of neutralizer specified on the label of your paint stripper, or it may not work.Warnings: Make sure to use paint stripper outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. It\u2019s a powerful, corrosive chemical, and the fumes can be very harmful if inhaled. Wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask when working with paint stripper."
