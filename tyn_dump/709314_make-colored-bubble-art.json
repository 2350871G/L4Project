        "Set the paper down on a flat surface and wait for it to dry.",
        "If there are any bubbles stuck to the paper, you can pop them with your finger or wait for them to pop on their own.",
        "The paper should be dry after about 10 minutes, but it could take longer if you used lots of bubbles or if it is cold outside.",
        "Using a Bubble Snake Find a place that can get messy.",
        "Outside would be a great idea.",
        "If you can't play outside, find a spot inside and cover the floor with newspaper.",
        "Keep your clothes clean by putting on an old shirt or an art smock.",
        "Cut a water bottle in half and keep the top part with the cap.",
        "Punch a hole in the middle of a plastic water bottle with a craft blade.",
        "Use the knife to saw around it the bottle to cut it in half.",
        "Throw away or recycle the bottom half and keep the top half with the cap.",
        "You do not need to remove the label.",
        "If the water bottle has grooves on it, use those as a cutting guide.",
        "Adult supervision is required for this step.",
        "Pull a sock over the cut end of the bottle and secure it with a rubber band.",
        "Scrunch a sock over the cut end of the bottle so that it is taut, like a drum.",
        "Slip a rubber band over the sock to hold it in place.",
        "If you don't have any rubber bands, you can twist a pipe cleaner around the sock and bottle instead.",
        "You can also wrap it with duct tape.",
        "Place 1 to 2 drops of food coloring onto the drum part of the sock.",
        "You can use the same color for both drops, or you can use different colors.",
        "If you decide to use different colors, think about how they will mix.",
        "For example, purple and orange will make brown, but blue and pink will make purple!",
        "If you use 2 different colors, you may get a tie dye effect or a solid color.",
        "This depends on how the bubbles come out of the bubble blower.",
        "Dip the sock-covered end into a bowl of plain bubble solution.",
        "You can use a homemade bubble solution, or you can use a store-bought one.",
        "Make sure that the bubble solution is plain and clear; you already added color to the sock.",
        "Remove the bottle cap and blow into it to produce a long, bubble snake.",
        "Unscrew the bottle cap first.",
        "Take a deep breath and exhale into the bubble blower like into a trumpet.",
        "When you blow, a long \"snake\" made from foamy bubbles will come out of the sock end of the bubble blower.",
        "Drape your snake onto a sheet of paper.",
        "The snake should stick to the bubble blower until you knock it off onto the paper.",
        "If it starts to fall off before that, just catch it with the paper instead.",
        "You can use any type of paper for this, but thicker paper, such as cardstock or watercolor paper, will work the best.",
        "Scrape or blow the bubble snake off, then let the bubble art dry.",
        "You can scrape the snake off with a thin piece of cardboard, or you can just blow on it until it falls off.",
        "You can also leave the snake on the paper until the bubbles pop or evaporate on their own.",
        "Don't scrape it off with your hand, however, or you may ruin your print!",
        "How long it takes for the bubble art to dry depends on how warm and sunny it is.",
        "Bubble art will take longer to dry in cold weather."
