    "text": " Accessing the Breaker Panel Turn off the main power to the breaker box. Locate the metal breaker box in your home, which is usually in a basement, kitchen, or hallway. Open the main door on the breaker box and look for a single switch on the top or side labeled \u201cMain\u201d or \u201cPower.\u201d Flip the switch into the Off position to shut off all of the electricity in your home. Once you turn off the power off, the breaker box will be safe to work in. You won\u2019t be able to use any electricity or outlets while you\u2019re installing the breaker. Use a flashlight or a battery-powered light while you\u2019re working so you can still see. Unscrew the panel cover to access the breakers. Locate the 6\u20138 screws along the edges of the breaker box\u2019s front panel. Turn the screws counterclockwise with a screwdriver to loosen them. Support the bottom of the panel cover as you remove the screws so it doesn\u2019t fall off. Carefully lower the panel cover and set it on the ground once you remove all of the screws.

Do not touch the main lugs, or else you could suffer from severe electrocution or death. Run wire conduit from the receptacle to the circuit box. The type of wire conduit depends on the receptacle you\u2019re installing. If you\u2019re using a single-pole circuit breaker, then you can use a 14/2 conduit, which has 3 wires that are a 14-gauge diameter. Use a 12/2 wire conduit for a double-pole breaker for appliances or a GFCI breaker, which has 3 wires that are a 12-gauge diameter. Fish the wires through your walls so they end next to your breaker box. You can buy wire conduits from your local hardware store. Remove a circular knockout out from the side of the box closest to the conduit. Look along the side or top of your breaker box to find perforated circles, also known as knockouts. Choose an empty knockout that\u2019s closest to the wire conduit running to the receptacle. Place the edge of your screwdriver against one of the knockouts and lightly tap on the handle with a hammer. Continue hitting the screwdriver until the knockout breaks off of the side. Place a layer of cardboard behind the knockout if you don\u2019t want to risk damaging any of the other breakers. Don\u2019t use the same knockout for multiple sources since you could easily confuse what the wires attach to. If there aren\u2019t any knockouts left on your breaker box, you can drill a hole through the side of the box where you want to feed the wires. Run the wire conduit into the circuit box through the hole and secure it in place. Feed the end of the wire conduit through the knockout hole so you have about 8\u201310 inches (20\u201325 cm) inside of the breaker box. Secure the wire inside of the box by wrapping a wire clamp around the knockout hole so it can\u2019t pull out on its own. You can buy wire clamps from your local hardware store. Strip 6 in (15 cm) the insulation off the wire. Grip the outside of the wire conduit with a pair of wire strippers so they\u2019re 6 inches (15 cm) from the end. Squeeze the handles of the wire strippers together as tightly as you can co clamp onto the insulation. Pull the strippers toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation. Depending on the conduit, you will either see 3 or 4 wires that were hidden inside. If you don\u2019t have a pair of wire strippers, you can also slice through the insulation with a utility knife. Be careful not to cut through any of the wires inside the conduit. Remove \u20448 in (1.6 cm) of the internal wires\u2019 insulation. The wires inside the conduit will each have a layer of insulation around them. Grip the wire between the jaws of your wire strippers so it\u2019s \u20448 inch (1.6 cm) from the end and squeeze the handles together. Pull the strippers toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation. Press the circuit breaker onto the bus bar to secure it. Make sure the new breaker you buy matches the current and voltage of what you need for the receptacle. Look for an empty place for the new breaker along the bus bars, which are the metal clips on the back of the box that the breakers attach to.

Make sure the breaker switch is in the Off position before you click it into place. Connecting a Single-Pole Circuit Push the end of the black wire into the \u201chot\u201d port on the breaker. Locate the black wire that\u2019s running into your breaker box from the hole you knocked out. Take the end of the black wire and feed it into the port on the breaker labeled \u201chot\u201d or \u201cpower\u201d as far as you\u2019re able to. Use a screwdriver to tighten the screw over the port to secure the wire to the breaker. A single-pole circuit will only have 1 port and 1 screw. The black wire will have full current and voltage running through it when you turn the power on. Secure the end of the white wire to a screw on the neutral bar. The neutral bar is a metal terminal inside your breaker box with multiple screws attached to other white wires. Turn one of the empty screws counterclockwise on the neutral bar to loosen it and slide the end of the white wire underneath it. Tighten the screw again to secure the wire in place so it doesn\u2019t move around. The neutral bar helps keep the current balanced so it\u2019s less likely to overload. Attach the green wire to an empty screw on the ground bar. Locate the ground bar, which is usually painted green and has multiple screws with other green or bare wires attached to them. Loosen one of the empty screws on the ground bar and slide the end of the green wire under the screw head. Turn the screw clockwise to tighten it and connect the ground wire. The ground wire may not have any insulation on it. The ground wire helps protect your electronics in case of a power surge by directing the current to a grounded point.Warning: Don\u2019t attach the ground wire to a terminal screw that already has another wire attached to it since you could damage the other wires. Wiring a Double-Pole Appliance Breaker Run the green wire to a terminal screw on the ground bar. Locate the bar on the side or bottom of the breaker box that has multiple screws with green and bare wires attached to them. Loosen an empty screw along the ground bar so you can slide the end of the green wire underneath it. Tighten the screw by turning it clockwise so the wire doesn\u2019t pull out of place. The ground wire inside the conduit may not have insulation. Attach the black wire to either port on the breaker. A double-pole breaker has 2 hot ports that supply power to an appliance or heavy-duty receptacle. Feed the end of the black wire into one of the ports on the breaker so it goes underneath the screw. Turn the screw clockwise to secure the wire in the port so it doesn\u2019t fall out. Lightly tug the wire to make sure it doesn\u2019t come undone. If the wire doesn\u2019t push into the port on the breaker, you may need to loosen the screw above the port first. Connect the white wire to the second port. Unlike a single-pole breaker, the white wire carries full power back to the receptacle rather than being neutral. Locate the second port on the breaker, which is usually right next to the first one, and feed the white wire into the port. Tighten the screw over the port so the wire stays in place. The wire conduit may instead contain a red wire instead of a white one. Use the red wire in the second port if that\u2019s the case. Put electrical tape around the white wire to mark it as hot. Since white wires are normally neutral, you need to mark it so you know that it\u2019s hot on the breaker. Wrap a piece of electrical tape about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from where it attaches to the breaker so you can easily tell that it\u2019s hot. Press the tape firmly onto the wire so it doesn\u2019t fall off. If the wire was red, you don\u2019t need to mark it with tape.Tip: Mark the white wire inside the receptacle or outlet with tape as well so you can easily tell which wires are hot on either end. Installing a GFCI Breaker Attach the white wire to the breaker port labeled \u201cNeutral.\u201d The neutral port on a GFCI breaker usually has a silver screw above it and is clearly labeled. Feed the end of the white wire from the conduit so the exposed end is completely in the port. Turn the screw clockwise to secure it so it can\u2019t get pulled out. You don\u2019t need to attach the white wire from the conduit to the neutral bar. You do not have to label or mark the white wire since it\u2019s still plugged into a neutral port on the breaker. Secure the black wire in the port labeled \u201cHot\u201d or \u201cPower.\u201d Look for a black screw on the breaker and find the port that\u2019s directly underneath it. Place the exposed end of the black wire in the port and tighten the screw to make a firm connection. Give the wire a light tug to make sure it doesn\u2019t slip out from the port.

        "Remove a circular knockout out from the side of the box closest to the conduit.",
        "Look along the side or top of your breaker box to find perforated circles, also known as knockouts.",
        "Choose an empty knockout that\u2019s closest to the wire conduit running to the receptacle.",
        "Place the edge of your screwdriver against one of the knockouts and lightly tap on the handle with a hammer.",
        "Continue hitting the screwdriver until the knockout breaks off of the side.",
        "Place a layer of cardboard behind the knockout if you don\u2019t want to risk damaging any of the other breakers.",
        "Don\u2019t use the same knockout for multiple sources since you could easily confuse what the wires attach to.",
        "If there aren\u2019t any knockouts left on your breaker box, you can drill a hole through the side of the box where you want to feed the wires.",
        "Run the wire conduit into the circuit box through the hole and secure it in place.",
        "Feed the end of the wire conduit through the knockout hole so you have about 8\u201310 inches (20\u201325 cm) inside of the breaker box.",
        "Secure the wire inside of the box by wrapping a wire clamp around the knockout hole so it can\u2019t pull out on its own.",

        "Strip 6 in (15 cm) the insulation off the wire.",
        "Grip the outside of the wire conduit with a pair of wire strippers so they\u2019re 6 inches (15 cm) from the end.",
        "Squeeze the handles of the wire strippers together as tightly as you can co clamp onto the insulation.",
        "Pull the strippers toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation.",
        "Depending on the conduit, you will either see 3 or 4 wires that were hidden inside.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a pair of wire strippers, you can also slice through the insulation with a utility knife.",
        "Be careful not to cut through any of the wires inside the conduit.",
        "Remove \u20448 in (1.6 cm) of the internal wires\u2019 insulation.",
        "The wires inside the conduit will each have a layer of insulation around them.",
        "Grip the wire between the jaws of your wire strippers so it\u2019s \u20448 inch (1.6 cm) from the end and squeeze the handles together.",
        "Pull the strippers toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation.",
        "Press the circuit breaker onto the bus bar to secure it.",
        "Make sure the new breaker you buy matches the current and voltage of what you need for the receptacle.",
        "Look for an empty place for the new breaker along the bus bars, which are the metal clips on the back of the box that the breakers attach to.",
        "Line up the hook on the breaker with the metal tab on the bus bar and firmly press the breaker until you hear it click into place.",
        "You can buy new circuit breakers from your local hardware store.",
        "The breaker will only stay secured if it\u2019s installed the right way.",
        "If the breaker doesn\u2019t click or it falls out, then try repositioning it along the bus bar.",
        "Make sure the breaker switch is in the Off position before you click it into place.",
        "Connecting a Single-Pole Circuit Push the end of the black wire into the \u201chot\u201d port on the breaker.",
        "Locate the black wire that\u2019s running into your breaker box from the hole you knocked out.",
        "Take the end of the black wire and feed it into the port on the breaker labeled \u201chot\u201d or \u201cpower\u201d as far as you\u2019re able to.",
        "Use a screwdriver to tighten the screw over the port to secure the wire to the breaker.",
        "A single-pole circuit will only have 1 port and 1 screw.",
        "The black wire will have full current and voltage running through it when you turn the power on.",
        "Secure the end of the white wire to a screw on the neutral bar.",
        "The neutral bar is a metal terminal inside your breaker box with multiple screws attached to other white wires.",
        "Turn one of the empty screws counterclockwise on the neutral bar to loosen it and slide the end of the white wire underneath it.",
        "Tighten the screw again to secure the wire in place so it doesn\u2019t move around.",
        "The neutral bar helps keep the current balanced so it\u2019s less likely to overload.",
        "Attach the green wire to an empty screw on the ground bar.",
        "Locate the ground bar, which is usually painted green and has multiple screws with other green or bare wires attached to them.",
        "Loosen one of the empty screws on the ground bar and slide the end of the green wire under the screw head.",
        "Turn the screw clockwise to tighten it and connect the ground wire.",
        "The ground wire may not have any insulation on it.",
        "The ground wire helps protect your electronics in case of a power surge by directing the current to a grounded point.Warning: Don\u2019t attach the ground wire to a terminal screw that already has another wire attached to it since you could damage the other wires.",
        "Wiring a Double-Pole Appliance Breaker Run the green wire to a terminal screw on the ground bar.",
        "Locate the bar on the side or bottom of the breaker box that has multiple screws with green and bare wires attached to them.",

        "The ground wire inside the conduit may not have insulation.",
        "Attach the black wire to either port on the breaker.",
        "A double-pole breaker has 2 hot ports that supply power to an appliance or heavy-duty receptacle.",
        "Feed the end of the black wire into one of the ports on the breaker so it goes underneath the screw.",
        "Turn the screw clockwise to secure the wire in the port so it doesn\u2019t fall out.",
        "Lightly tug the wire to make sure it doesn\u2019t come undone.",
        "If the wire doesn\u2019t push into the port on the breaker, you may need to loosen the screw above the port first.",
        "Connect the white wire to the second port.",
        "Unlike a single-pole breaker, the white wire carries full power back to the receptacle rather than being neutral.",
        "Locate the second port on the breaker, which is usually right next to the first one, and feed the white wire into the port.",
        "Tighten the screw over the port so the wire stays in place.",
        "The wire conduit may instead contain a red wire instead of a white one.",
        "Use the red wire in the second port if that\u2019s the case.",
        "Put electrical tape around the white wire to mark it as hot.",
        "Since white wires are normally neutral, you need to mark it so you know that it\u2019s hot on the breaker.",
        "Wrap a piece of electrical tape about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from where it attaches to the breaker so you can easily tell that it\u2019s hot.",
        "Press the tape firmly onto the wire so it doesn\u2019t fall off.",
        "If the wire was red, you don\u2019t need to mark it with tape.Tip: Mark the white wire inside the receptacle or outlet with tape as well so you can easily tell which wires are hot on either end.",
        "Installing a GFCI Breaker Attach the white wire to the breaker port labeled \u201cNeutral.\u201d The neutral port on a GFCI breaker usually has a silver screw above it and is clearly labeled.",
        "Feed the end of the white wire from the conduit so the exposed end is completely in the port.",
        "Turn the screw clockwise to secure it so it can\u2019t get pulled out.",
        "You don\u2019t need to attach the white wire from the conduit to the neutral bar.",
        "You do not have to label or mark the white wire since it\u2019s still plugged into a neutral port on the breaker.",
        "Secure the black wire in the port labeled \u201cHot\u201d or \u201cPower.\u201d Look for a black screw on the breaker and find the port that\u2019s directly underneath it.",
        "Place the exposed end of the black wire in the port and tighten the screw to make a firm connection.",
        "Give the wire a light tug to make sure it doesn\u2019t slip out from the port.",
