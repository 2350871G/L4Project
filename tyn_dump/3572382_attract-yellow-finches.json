        "This also discourages hungry squirrels from toppling the feeder.",
        "Keep the feeder about the same level as nearby tree branches so the finches have plenty of cover.",
        "Metal feeder poles are are a great resource since they allow to place a feeder almost anywhere, even if you don't have long tree branches nearby.",
        "If you decide the feeder is in a bad spot, pull the pole out of the ground and plant it elsewhere.",
        "Position feeders about 10 ft (3.0 m) away from tree trunks.",
        "Naughty cats and squirrels may climb trees and reach the feeders.",
        "For finches, feeders don't need to be underneath the tree branches.",
        "As long as the trees are close by, you have a good chance of attracting yellow finches.",
        "Finches make their nests in thick shrubs near open fields and rivers.",
        "Put your feeders close to these sorts of areas to have the best chance of attracting them.",
        "They don't go deep into forests to feed, so spacing feeders apart from trees is fine.",
        "Place the feeder away from other feeders.",
        "Yellow finches are somewhat shy and tend to stay away from busy areas.",
        "Keep finch feeders about 15 ft (4.6 m) away from any other bird feeders in the area.",
        "Watch the feeders as birds go to them.",
        "If you see larger or more aggressive birds and predators, reposition the feeder.",
        "Also, be aware of climbable surfaces like walls and buildings.",
        "Feeders near these areas are often vulnerable to clever predators, so finches will avoid them.",
        "Place the feeder in a location that is visible from a distance so you are able to watch the finches without disturbing them.",
        "Maintaining the Feeding Environment Empty half-filled feeders to remove old and compacted seed.",
        "Seed at the bottom of a feeder accumulates moisture and compacts over time.",
        "Yellow finches are a little picky, and if you see them avoiding a good feeder, this could be why.",
        "Pour out the old seed and refill the feeder to keep the finches coming.",
        "Check the old seed at least once a month, preferably when you deep-clean the feeder.",
        "If it looks healthy, mix it in with the new seed.",
        "Fresh thistle seeds, for instance, look black and oily.",
        "Plan on checking the feeder as often as possible to keep it clean and well-stocked.",
        "Deep-clean feeders twice a month with water and bleach.",
        "Dilute 1 part liquid bleach in 9 parts clean water.",
        "Then, remove the seeds from the feeder and rinse it out.",
        "Soak the feeder in the mixture and scrub off any debris with a nylon bottle brush.",
        "Rinse the feeder out with clean water, wipe it off with a paper towel, and let it finish drying in sunlight to eliminate all bacteria.",
        "Clean feeders every 2 weeks or more to prevent mold and bacteria.",
        "Feeders need to be cleaned more often during rainy periods or when you hear reports about salmonella outbreaks in your area.",
        "Liquid dish soap also helps when cleaning feeders, but it doesn't eliminate mold.",
        "Bleach is more effective at sterilizing feeders.",
        "Wash and refill birdbaths 2 to 3 times a week.",
        "Drain the water, then wipe the birdbath clean with a paper towel or sponge.",
        "To give it a more thorough cleaning, mix 1 part white vinegar with 9 parts water.",
        "Scrub the bath and put more clean water in it for the finches.",
        "Birdbaths are prone to the same bacteria that wet feeders are, so clean them as often as possible to prevent yellow finches from getting sick.",
        "You may need to refill a birdbath more often, especially during dry weather.",
        "Tie bright ribbons near feeders away from colorful wildflowers.",
        "Colorful ribbons are a shortcut for times when you can't grow flowers around a feeder.",
        "Knot the ribbon around branches or poles close to the feeder.",
        "Let the ends of the ribbon hang so they blow about in the breeze.",
        "Finches notice the color and movement of the ribbon when they're flying by the feeder.",
        "If they see the ribbon moving without other birds or predators nearby, they may stop by the feeder.",
        "Set out more food during the winter to attract traveling finches.",
        "Yellow finches head towards warmer weather in search of food.",
        "They travel in large flocks during these months.",
        "If you are able to provide plenty of food in your feeders, you will most likely see a few stop by or even end up with repeat visitors.",
        "Finches normally range from the northern part of Canada to part of the southern U.S.",
        "In winter, they range from the southern end of Canada to as far as Mexico.",
        "Finches nest and lay eggs in the summer.",
        "They then molt in autumn.",
        "If the birds look a little dull-colored, it's because of their new feathers."
