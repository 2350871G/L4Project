Dry fitting means that you won't use any adhesives or fasteners at this time, because you're just checking to make sure everything fits. Be sure the pan fits snugly within the space, but not too tight or the pan may buckle. If the fit is too sloppy, you are likely to have movement issues that can cause seams to separate and create serious water seepage. A fit that is too loose will require additional stabilization of the pan. Check to see if the drain cut-out in the pan lines up and fits properly over the drain pipe. Never force it to line up, as this can cause damage to the pan and to the drain pipe. A little movement (about a half-inch or so in each direction) of the pipe is fine, and will help when lining up the drain components. Since drain components vary by manufacturer, follow the illustrations that come with your shower pan for test fitting. Once you are satisfied that everything fits properly, you are ready to complete the permanent installation."
