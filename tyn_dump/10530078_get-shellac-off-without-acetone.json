        "Re-soak your nail if there's any polish that seems too hard.",
        "Don\u2019t scrape too hard if the polish doesn\u2019t come away easily, or you could damage your nail bed.",
        "Instead, replace the cotton ball on your nail (using a new one if necessary), re-wrap your nail in foil, and wait another 5 minutes or so.",
        "Acetone-free nail polish remover isn't as powerful as a version with acetone, so you'll sometimes have to soak your nails longer if the polish is especially stubborn.",
        "Repeat the same process for each of your nails.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished taking the polish off of one nail, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what to expect as you continue.",
        "Unwrap the foil from each nail one-by-one, then wipe away the polish with a cotton ball and scrape away the residue with the orange stick.",
        "When you're finished, move on to the next nail until you've removed all of the polish.",
        "Apply moisturizer to your nails when you\u2019re finished.",
        "Non-acetone nail polish can be drying to your skin, and the process of scraping your nails can leave them feeling rough.",
        "Smooth a thin coat of moisturizer, like cuticle oil or hand cream, over the surface of your nails.",
        "You can also moisturize the skin around your nails, if you want."
