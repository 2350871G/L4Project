The infeed table is at the front that you set your depth with, and the outfeed table is under the handle, that you hold firmly to the freshly cut timber. The outfeed table is fixed.  The blades should be set fractionally above the outfeed table.  This method will allow you to set them both to the same height and  parallel to the table.  When the blades are a lot too high they will leave a scoop in the end of the timber. If they are too low, the planer won't work very well, it won't feel positive. Set the blades a touch higher than the outfeed table and you will get a positive feel to the cut and this also allows for the blades to wear a bit.
