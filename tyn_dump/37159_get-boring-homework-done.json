        "Sometimes boring homework is actually homework that you find difficult.",
        "Take the time to ask for help.",
        "Help is available all around you.",
        "You can ask your teachers for help at school, your parents or siblings for help when you get home, or a classmate who might be able to explain the homework to you.",
        "Talk to your family and friends about your homework.",
        "Talking about your homework can help you figure out problems and motivate you to complete it.",
        "Your family and friends may also have suggestions for when you're struggling or they may cheer you on when you're feeling unmotivated.",
        "If you're writing a paper, talk to someone about the topic.",
        "Talking out your ideas can help you figure out what you want to write.",
        "For math, try to tell someone what you struggle with.",
        "Just by identifying the problem, you may be able to work out a solution.",
        "Ask your family about their opinions on the topic you're learning.",
        "Start a discussion about the assignment.",
        "This can make the subject more exciting and help you complete the project.",
        "Get someone to check your work.",
        "It always helps to have a second pair of eyes go over your work and help check for any mistakes.",
        "Ask your parents or an older sibling to look over your homework before you put it away for the night.",
        "Your checker can also help keep you on track to getting your homework done.",
        "For example, if you ask your mom to check your homework at 8:00 PM, you are committing to having your homework finished by that time.",
        "Find a homework buddy.",
        "Sometimes the best way to get through boring homework is to do it with a friend.",
        "Find a classmate you can do your homework with to help keep each other motivated and on task.",
        "For extra motivation, you could start a challenge with your homework buddy.",
        "For example, you could compete to see who can get the highest grade on the next test.",
        "Be cautious when picking a homework buddy.",
        "You want to find someone who helps you focus and not someone who distracts you.",
        "Announce that you\u2019re doing homework.",
        "When you finish making your homework plan, share it with your family at home.",
        "By sharing your plan with the people around you, you\u2019re making a commitment to finish the work and you\u2019re asking those people to hold you accountable.",
        "Be specific with your plan.",
        "Tell your family exactly when, where and what homework you\u2019ll be doing.",
        "For example, instead of saying, \u201cI\u2019m doing homework!\u201d you can say, \u201cI\u2019m studying for my math test in my room for the next hour.",
        "Can someone check on me when the hour is up?\u201d"
