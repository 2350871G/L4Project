Recent growth indicates that the plant has not grown dormant, so you should be able to spur new growth from a cutting. Snip several 2 1/2-inch (6 1/3-centimeter) stems from the rosemary. Choose the most recently grown stems, since these have the greatest growing potential. Remove the bottom set of leaves from your cuttings. Use scissors or shears to cut them off. Yanking the leaves off by hand could cause damage. Dip the bottom of each cutting in a little water. The cuttings do not need to soak. They just need to be a little moist. Encourage rooting with a hormone rooting powder. Dip the bottom of each cutting into the powder, immersing it by about 1/4 inch (2/3 centimeter). Doing so will increase the cutting's odds of taking root. Mix equal amounts of peat moss and perlite in a plastic seedling tray. Other small containers, ranging from pots to plastic cups, can also be used. Fix each cutting into its own container. If using a seedling tray, place one cutting in each separate compartment.
