        "Make it into a fun afternoon with friends or a bonding experience with your partner.",
        "Serve some finger foods and coffee or wine to create a party atmosphere and make the experience fun.",
        "You should also have decaf coffee and juice on hand for anyone unable to drink.",
        "Be sure that you handle any thank-note notes yourself for the friends that help you make the rest.",
        "Proofread the cards and erase any pencil marks you made.",
        "First, wait for your ink to dry so you don't smudge it as you finalize your cards.",
        "Look over the cards for skipped words, missing commas, or spelling mistakes.",
        "Then, erase away any pencil marks you made, leaving behind only your inked messages.",
        "If you make a really noticeable mistake, start over on one of your extra cards.",
        "If it's just a small mistake, sometimes you can cover it up by creatively making a letter out of the unintended mark or drawing a heart or something like like that over it.",
        "Sending the Thank-You Notes Include a picture with the thank-you notes.",
        "If you have copies available, you can send an ultrasound picture or a picture of the new baby.",
        "Alternatively, if you took a nice group photo at the shower, sending along a memory of the day is a nice, personal touch.",
        "Adding a photo is an extra touch that you can skip if you don't want to include it or don't have the extra money to print the photos.",
        "Address the envelopes with the recipients' names and addresses.",
        "The envelopes are the first thing people will see, so take your time and put as much care and effort into addressing them as neatly as you did the cards.",
        "Don't forget to put your return address on the envelope.",
        "You can also use a ruler on the envelopes to make guides for straight lines.",
        "On each envelope, just line up the left edge of the ruler with the left edge of the envelope and very lightly draw your pencil along top of the ruler to make straight lines.",
        "After you\u2019ve written the address in ink, simply erase the pencil marks.",
        "You can also print address labels with your home printer, but that is less personal.",
        "Seal, stamp, and mail the cards without delay.",
        "The last thing you want after you\u2019ve spent all the time and effort into making beautiful baby shower thank-you notes is to forget to mail them or spill something on them and ruin them.",
        "The best way to avoid these situations is to stamp and mail the cards immediately after they're completed.",
        "A fun added touch on the envelope is to \u201cseal\u201d the back with the baby\u2019s handprint.",
        "To avoid actually using the baby\u2019s hand to stamp all the cards, you can make one print, copy it, carefully cut it out and glue it to the envelope.",
        "For a cute touch, ask the post office for specialty stamps.",
        "They change all the time, but there are usually sweet options like hearts or stamps that feature the themes of love or new life.",
        "To save time, you can order postage stamps online directly from the U.S.",
        "Postal Service.",
        "It only takes a day or two to receive them in the mail."
