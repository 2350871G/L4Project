    "text": " Removing Your Existing Tub Cut a panel behind your tub to access the drain pipes. Most times, the water supply valve for your tub is located in the walls behind the faucet. Go into the room adjacent to your bathroom to cut a hole in the wall where the drain and faucets are for your tub. Use a stud finder so you don\u2019t accidentally cut into one of the studs. Cut an 8 in \u00d7 8 in (20 cm \u00d7 20 cm) square in the drywall with a reciprocating saw to expose the pipes. If you can\u2019t access the room adjacent to the drain, cut a hole in the floor beneath the bathroom using a reciprocating saw. Make sure you\u2019re underneath where the tub drains. Wear safety glasses while working with your saw. Turn off the water supply to your bathroom. The water supply for your tub is either controlled by a valve in the wall behind your faucet or by the main water pump. Turn the valve so it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipes to turn it off. If your valve shut-off is circular, look for the directions printed on the valve head to figure out which way to turn it. If you cannot turn off the water for your tub or bathroom, you may need to turn it off for the entire home or building. Remove the tub spout. Locate the screw on the underside of the faucet or where it connects to the wall. Use a flathead or Phillips screwdriver to remove the screw. If it doesn\u2019t have a screw, tighten the jaws of a pipe wrench around  the back of the faucet and twist it counterclockwise until it\u2019s loose. Then, pull it out. If you want to save the faucet, put a rag in between it and the wrench so you don\u2019t leave any scratches. Take out the main and overflow drains. A drain removal tool is a cylinder that fits into the drain to loosen its connection to the pipes. Put the end of a drain remover tool in the drain hole and turn it counterclockwise. Keep turning the tool until the drain is loose and you can pull it out by hand. Unscrew the overflow drain, located on the front wall of your tub, and pull it off of the surface. Drain removers can be bought from your local hardware store. Some tub drains have screens that you need to remove with a screwdriver before you can use the remover tool. Take out the drain shoe from the access panel you cut. The drain shoe is made up of the pipes that connect the overflow and the main drain to your tub. Look for the T-shaped connector holding the pipes together, and use a pipe wrench to twist the drain shoe off of the main pipes. If the joint is stuck or won\u2019t come out with a pipe wrench, cut through the pipes with a reciprocating saw or hacksaw. Remove the tub surround and drywall around your tub. The surround is the tile or fiberglass on the walls around your tub. Use a pry bar or the back of a claw hammer to rip the surround away from your tub. When you reach the drywall, use a razor knife to cut out the area around that extends 6 inches (15 cm) from the top of your tub until the studs are exposed. Wear safety glasses, work gloves, and a respirator to keep yourself protected. If your tub has a surround panel made from fiberglass, you need to take out the entire piece in order to install a new bathtub. Pull out the nails or screws connecting the tub flange to the studs. The flange around your tub is the raised edge that keeps water from draining into your walls. Use an electric screwdriver or the back of your claw hammer to remove the screws or nails from the flange. Make sure to check each stud around your bath for any nails. Some older tubs may not be nailed or screwed into the wall. Cut any caulk holding the tub the to floor. Run a razor knife through the caulk or sealant surrounding your tub. Cut through the line of sealant that connects the apron, or front of your tub, to the floor. Lift the tub out of place with a partner\u2019s help. Grab the tub from the side opposite of the drain and lift it out from its place. Have a partner help slide the tub backward away from the drain pipes. Stand the tub upright and work together to carry it out from your bathroom. Check with your city\u2019s waste department to find out how to properly dispose of the old bathtub. Don\u2019t attempt to lift a cast-iron or steel tub out by yourself since they can be extremely heavy. Leveling and Prepping Your Work Area Purchase a tub that matches the size and layout of your old one. Measure the size of the alcove and note the drain direction. Use a tape measure to find the maximum length and width of the alcove. Note whether your drain is on the left, right, or center of the tub Find a tub from your local home store that fits in the alcove and has a drain in the same place. Most standard tubs are about 5 feet (1.5 m) long and 2 \u20442 feet (0.76 m) wide. Common Types of Bathtubs\nAcrylic and fiberglass tubs are the cheapest and the easiest to maneuver due to their light weight. Cast-iron tubs are durable and hold heat longer, but they are heavier and difficult to maneuver. Level the floor with an underlayment if it\u2019s not already flat. Underlayment is a thin layer of concrete that smooths the surface of your floor. Check your floor with a level to see if it sits flat.

Applying a layer of underlayment allows you to remove the tub easier if you need to fix any plumbing issues. Underlayment can be purchased from your local hardware store. Fit the new tub into the alcove and mark the height of the flanges. Set your new tub into the opening where the old one used to be. Make sure your tub sits level on the floor. Use a pencil or marker to trace a line on your studs at the same height as the flanges on your tub. Once you have each stud marked, take the tub out from the alcove again. If the tub isn\u2019t level, place hardwood shims underneath it until it sits flat. Attach ledger boards to the studs below your flange marks. Nail or screw 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards so the top edge is even with the marks you drew on the studs. Use flat, straight boards that are the same length as the sides of your tub. Ledger boards help support your tub, but they cannot hold its full weight.

Installing the New Tub Slide the new tub in place so the flanges rest on the ledger boards. Have a partner help you slide your new tub into place. Feed the drain shoe into the hole in the floor, and set the rest of the tub down. Make sure the tub is level one more time before securing it to the wall. Make sure the tub is in full contact with the floor so the ledger boards aren\u2019t supporting the full weight. Screw or nail the tub into the studs. Use screws or nails that are 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) long to secure the tub flange to the the studs. Work slowly so you don\u2019t accidentally crack your tub. Put 1 nail or screw into each stud to keep it in place.Tip: If there are any gaps between the studs and the tub flange that are \u20448 in (0.32 cm) or larger, put wooden shims in before you put in nails or screws.

Use a pipe wrench to tighten the drain shoe to the P-trap until it\u2019s completely secure. Squeeze a ring of silicone sealant around the pipe and P-trap for another layer of protection from leaks. Reattach the faucet. If the faucet had a screw, put the faucet back on with a screwdriver and turn it clockwise. If the faucet screwed off by itself, twist it back on by hand and use a pipe wrench to secure the faucet in place completely. Fill the tub and test for leaks the day after it\u2019s installed. Let the sealant on your tub dry for 1 day so it\u2019s completely set. Turn the water valve back on and let it fill the tub. Listen for any dripping noises and watch for any noticeable leaks near your drain or on your pipes. If you find any leaks, use more sealant around the leaking area. Check the drain shoe from the access panel you cut earlier so see if any water is leaking underneath your tub. Cover the exposed studs and flange with drywall or cement backerboard. Cut the pieces of drywall to the sizes of your gaps with a reciprocating saw. Hold the piece of drywall or backerboard against the studs so it covers the flange and there\u2019s a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) gap between the board and the tub. Use nails to secure the boards in place. Drywall or backerboard can be purchased from your local hardware store. Don\u2019t forget to install new drywall on the access panel you cut out from the other room. Replace the surround. If you\u2019re using tiles, mix tile mortar in a bucket based on the instructions on the packaging. Stir the mortar with a flat trowel and spread it on the drywall. Press the tiles onto the backerboard and hold it in place for 30 seconds. Use tiles that match the existing ones in your bathroom. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to retile the entire wall. For a fiberglass surround, set the entire piece in place so it covers the tub flange.
