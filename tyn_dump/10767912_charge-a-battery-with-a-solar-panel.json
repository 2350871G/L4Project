For example, you might see 300W listed on the back of your panel, which means the array produces 300 watts of energy. If you don\u2019t have one of those or you built your own solar array, use a multimeter to measure the wattage output of your solar panel when it\u2019s in the full sun. Solar panels are designed to produce more power than the voltage they're rated for. For instance, a solar power designed for a 12V output might actually produce 17V of power. That's because they'll only produce their max voltage under ideal conditions. If the solar panel produces more power than the battery can handle, the battery can overcharge and be damaged. A charge controller helps prevent this from occurring."

This will give you the amps that your charge controller needs to be able to handle in order to safely charge the battery. Often, charge controllers will be rated in multiples of 30 amps, so when you get your number, round up to the next highest rating. For example, if your solar panel is 300W and you want to charge a 12V battery, you\u2019d divide 300 by 12 to get 25 amps. In that case, you\u2019d get a charge controller rated for 30 amps."
