Do not use the watery portion of the coconut milk sitting at the bottom of the can. Using it would result in very thin yogurt. If using probiotic capsules, open the capsules and use the powder inside. You could also use 2 tsp (10 ml) probiotic powder, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) store-bought coconut yogurt, or 2 Tbsp (30 ml) fermented coconut water probiotic kefir. Raw sugar works well as a sweetener, but you could easily use the same amount of maple sugar, raw honey, or agave. If you prefer less-sweet yogurt, you can omit the sweetener altogether."

A closed oven with the light on will maintain a stable temperature between 105 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (40 to 43 degrees Celsius), which is ideal for the fermentation process. Do not turn the oven on since doing so will make the interior too hot, which will likely kill the probiotics. The yogurt will become thicker with a longer incubation period.

        "Place the cans of coconut milk in your refrigerator and allow them to sit overnight, or for at least 8 hours.",
        "Refrigeration will help separate the coconut cream from the water.",
        "If you prefer working with fresher ingredients, you can use fresh coconut meat instead of canned coconut milk.",
        "Combine 2 cups (500 ml) fresh coconut meat with 1/2 cup (125 ml) coconut water or filtered water, blending until smooth.",
        "You can use this blend immediately; no refrigeration is required.",
        "Scoop out the solidified cream.",
        "Open the cans of coconut milk and scoop out the solidified cream sitting on top.",
        "Discard the watery portion sitting in the bottom of the can.",
        "Do not shake the cans before opening them since doing so will combine the cream and water, resulting in watery yogurt.",
        "Blend the ingredients together.",
        "Place the solidified coconut milk in your blender or food processor.",
        "Add the lemon juice, probiotic, and salt.",
        "Blend the ingredients together until well-combined and very smooth.",
        "Open and empty the probiotic capsules; do not add whole capsules to the blender.",
        "If you don't have probiotic capsules, you could use 1 tsp (5 ml) probiotic powder or 1/4 cup (60 ml) coconut water probiotic kefir.",
        "Adjust as desired.",
        "Taste the yogurt.",
        "Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid sweetener, if desired, and blend the yogurt again until the sweetener is evenly distributed.",
        "Maple syrup, agave, coconut nectar, and natural liquid cane sugar are all good choices.",
        "If the yogurt is too thick for your preferences, you could also add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of coconut water or purified water to thin it out.",
        "Chill until cool.",
        "Transfer the yogurt to an airtight plastic container and place it in your refrigerator.",
        "Allow the yogurt to chill for approximately 2 or 3 hours.",
        "This step isn't strictly necessary, but if you eat the yogurt immediately, it will be lukewarm and may seem less palatable.",
        "Enjoy.",
        "Remove the yogurt from the refrigerator and serve it while it's still cool.",
        "Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container and use them within two weeks."
