        "Toasting Walnuts in the Oven Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).",
        "Since toasting walnuts doesn\u2019t take very long, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure your oven is all the way up to temperature before you begin.",
        "Furthermore, since walnuts are delicate, a gentle baking temp of about 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) is essential to make sure they don\u2019t burn while you\u2019re toasting them.",
        "Toss the shelled walnuts in oil and seasoning if you like.",
        "Although it\u2019s not necessary, you can add a little olive oil or clarified butter to the walnuts before you toast them to add flavor.",

        "Try tossing the walnuts in a little salt, then add either cinnamon for a smoky sweet flavor, or cayenne pepper for savory and spicy nuts.",
        "Spread the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer.",
        "If you crowd the walnuts too much in the pan, they won\u2019t brown evenly, so make sure that none are sitting on top of each other.",
        "If you need to, use more than one baking sheet.",
        "For quick and easy cleanup, line your baking sheet with parchment paper before you add the walnuts.",
        "Toast the walnuts in the oven for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "Your walnuts will burn quickly if you\u2019re not watching them, so stay close while they\u2019re in the oven.",
        "Several times during the cooking process, shake the pan or stir the walnuts with a long-handled spoon.",
        "This will help the walnuts brown evenly.",
        "The walnuts should be about 1 shade darker than they started when they\u2019re finished toasting.",
        "Let the walnuts cool and enjoy!",
        "You can serve your toasted walnuts plain, add them to your favorite savory dish or salad, or incorporate them in a delicious dessert!",

        "Toasting Walnuts on the Stovetop Toss the walnuts in butter and seasonings if you prefer.",
        "You don\u2019t need any oil to toast your walnuts on the stovetop, but you can toss them in 1\u20132 teaspoons (4.9\u20139.9 mL) clarified butter to add a little extra flavor.",
        "In addition, you can sprinkle them with salt or other seasonings if you like, although this is also up to you.",
        "For a sweet-and-spicy combo, toss the walnuts in butter and a pinch of cayenne pepper before you toast them, then toss them in a little sugar after you\u2019re done.",
        "Add walnuts to a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat.",
        "A heavy skillet helps distribute heat more evenly, so you won\u2019t have hot spots where some walnuts cook faster than others.",
        "Let the skillet get hot first, then add the nuts to the pan.",
        "A cast-iron skillet is great for toasting walnuts, but any heavy skillet will work.",
        "Toast the walnuts for 2-5 minutes.",
        "Toasting walnuts\u2013or any nuts\u2013on the stovetop can be difficult because they go from almost-done to burnt with little warning.",
        "Watch the walnuts carefully while they\u2019re cooking, and stir frequently.",
        "Take them off the heat immediately when they are done.",

        "If you don\u2019t use them all right away, place them into an airtight container, where they\u2019ll keep for about a week.",
        "If you need to store the walnuts longer, you can place the airtight container into the freezer, where they\u2019ll stay good for 1-2 years.",
        "Making Candied Walnuts Heat sugar, cinnamon, salt, and milk in a medium saucepan.",
        "This will be the basis for the caramel that candies your walnuts.",
        "Heat the mixture over medium-high heat for 8 minutes.",
        "The mixture should be at soft-ball stage, or about 236 \u00b0F (113 \u00b0C).",
        "In soft-ball stage, if you drop a small amount of syrup into cold water, then roll the syrup with your fingers, you\u2019ll find that it forms a ball that is soft and easily flattened under pressure.",
        "Add a generous pinch of cayenne if you want a spicy-sweet candied walnut.",
        "Remove your saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla.",
        "The mixture will start to harden as soon as it cools, so stir in your vanilla right away.",
        "This should leave you with a sweet-smelling caramel syrup that you can still stir around.",
        "If you like, you can experiment with other flavorings, like orange or peppermint extract.",
        "Stir the walnuts into the syrup.",
        "Keep mixing until you\u2019re sure all of the walnuts are fully coated.",
        "Remember, the mixture will be cooling, so you\u2019ll need to do this step quickly or the nuts will get stuck to the saucepan.",
        "Spoon the nuts onto waxed paper and separate with a fork right away.",
        "If you leave the walnuts piled together, they\u2019ll harden that way, leaving you with a sticky clump that\u2019s hard to eat.",
        "As soon as you move the walnuts to the waxed paper, spread them out so none of the nuts are touching each other.",
        "Waxed paper will keep the caramel from sticking to the surface when it cools, and it will also make cleanup easier.",
        "Let cool, then serve them or store them in airtight containers.",
        "Candied walnuts, like their toasted counterparts, will stay good in airtight containers for about a week, but these are so good that they probably won\u2019t last that long!",
        "Candied walnuts are a delicious addition to salads and desserts, or you can enjoy them by themselves as a snack.",
        "If you\u2019re making candied walnuts near the holidays, place some in a decorative bag and tie it with a pretty ribbon for an easy last-minute hostess gift.",
        "Removing the Shells from Whole Walnuts Soak whole walnuts in water for about 1-2 hours to soften them.",
        "Place the whole walnuts in a large bowl or bucket, then fill it up with water so the walnuts are completely covered.",
        "Soaking the walnuts will make them easier to crack, and you\u2019ll have better luck getting the meat out whole.",
        "For best results, start with hot water.",
        "Dry the nuts off with a clean towel after soaking them.",
        "You won't get all of the water out of the shells, but drying off the surface of the walnuts will help keep them from slipping while you're trying to open the nuts.",
        "Use a clean towel so you don't deposit any germs onto the walnut shells.",
        "Place the walnut in a nutcracker if you have one.",
        "Walnuts are one of the toughest nuts to crack, so you\u2019ll need some kind of a tool to help you.",
        "If you have a nutcracker, place the whole walnut inside and pull the lever or turn the knob that operates the nutcracker\u2019s mechanisms.",
        "If using the nutcracker doesn\u2019t work at first, try again with a little more force.",
        "You can also place the walnut into a vice grip and turn the vice until the walnut shell splits.",
        "Hit the walnut with a hammer if you don\u2019t have a nutcracker or a vice grip.",
        "Place the walnut on a flat surface with the pointed end facing up, and strike the top of the nut with the hammer until it cracks along its outside edge.",
        "Opening walnuts with a hammer frequently leads to smashed fingers, so if you have another way of opening the nut, you might want to try that first.",
        "If you do use this approach, do so with caution.",
        "Pull the walnut shell apart with your fingers.",
        "Once the shell splits, use your hands to open the nut the rest of the way.",
        "This will help prevent the fragile walnut meat inside from breaking into smaller pieces.",
        "Slide a nutpick under the meat to remove it.",
        "A nutpick is a thin, sharp tool used for removing the insides of nuts from the shells.",
        "Carefully slide it under the walnut meat, working it around the shell until the meat comes free.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a nutpick, use a small knife or an icepick instead.",
        "Once you've shelled the walnuts, you can enjoy them raw, cook with them, place them in an airtight container.",
        "Walnuts will keep in the pantry for 2-4 weeks, the refrigerator for up to a year, and the freezer for up to 2 years."
