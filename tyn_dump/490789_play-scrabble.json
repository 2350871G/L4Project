You will need a game board, 100 letter tiles, one letter rack for each player, and a cloth bag to hold the letter tiles. You will also need 1-3 other people to play with. Choose a dictionary to use for challenges. It is possible that during the course of your game, someone will play a word that another player believes is invalid. In a situation like this, you will need to look up the word in a dictionary. Make sure that you have a dictionary or a mobile device with a Scrabble checker app on hand to deal with challenges. Put the tiles in the bag and shake them. To make sure that the letters are distributed fairly, put them into the bag, close it, and shake them around a bit. Determine who goes first. Pass the bag around the table and allow each player to draw one tile. Then, place your tiles face up on the table. The player with the letter that is closest to the letter \u201cA\u201d gets to go first. Put these letters back into the bag and shuffle them again before drawing tiles. If any player draws a blank tile, he or she will start the game. Draw your tiles. Beginning with the person who drew the tile closest to \"A\", allow the players to take seven tiles. Hold the bag above eye level so that you can't see the tiles. Do not show these tiles to your fellow players. Just put them onto your tile rack and pass the bag to the next player until everyone has drawn their letters. Playing the Game Play the first word. The player who chose the letter closest to \u201cA\u201d gets to play the first word. The word must use at least two tiles and it must be placed across the star square in the center of the board. The word can be laid out in a vertical or horizontal fashion, but it cannot be diagonal. When calculating the first word score, keep in mind that the player who places the first word gets to double his or her total score because the star counts as a Premium Square with a double word bonus. For example, if the total value of the first word played was 8, then the player would receive a score of 16. Count up your points. After you have put down a word, make sure that you count up your points. Add up the points on the lower right corner of each of the tiles you laid down. If you placed a tile on a Premium Square, adjust your score as indicated by the Premium Square. For example, if you place a word over a square that says \u201cDouble Word\u201d on it, then you should double the total value of your word. If you place a tile over a square that says \u201cDouble Letter\u201d, then you should double the value of that letter tile only when you calculate your score. Draw new tiles. After each of your turns, you will need to draw as many new tiles as you just played. For example, if you played three of your tiles to form a word during your turn, then you need to draw three new tiles at the end of your turn. Place these new tiles on your rack and pass the bag to the next player. Build on other players\u2019 words. On your next turn, you will have to add onto the words that your opponents have just played. That means that you cannot just create a freestanding word on the board, all of the tiles must be connected. As you build onto the words that your opponents have played, make sure that you consider all of the connected tiles. Your addition to the board must create at least one new word, but if you connect to other tiles, from other directions, then you need to make sure that you are creating valid words with these connections. Use your tiles to get the highest score possible per turn. It is a good idea to consider multiple plays during each of your turns and to go with the play that will gain you the most points. Look for opportunities to incorporate Premium Squares and high value letters like \u201cZ\u201d and \u201cQ\u201d into your plays. Available Premium Squares include:\n\nDouble Letter Score: This means that a letter placed on this square receives double the number of points that are shown on the letter. Double Word Score: This means that a word that is made that includes the letter that is placed on this square receives double the number of points that it otherwise would. Triple Letter Score: This means that a letter placed on this square receives three times the number of points that are shown on the letter. Triple Word Score: This means that a word that is made that includes the letter that is placed on this square receives triple the number of points that it otherwise would. Challenge other players to dispute a word. If you think that a player has played a word that does not exist or that another player has misspelled a word, then you can challenge that player. When you challenge a player, you look up the word in the dictionary. If the word is in the dictionary and the player has spelled it correctly, then the word stays and the player gets the points. The challenger loses his or her turn. If the word is not in the dictionary or the player has spelled it incorrectly, then the player must remove the word from the board. The player gains no points and loses that turn. Exchange tiles you don\u2019t want. At some point during the game, you may decide that you want to exchange some or all of your tiles for new ones. You can use a turn to get new tiles. Just discard the tiles that you no longer want into the bag, shuffle the bag and draw the number of tiles that you discarded. Just keep in mind that you cannot play a word in addition to drawing new tiles, this will count as your turn. Scoring Keep score as you go. It is important to keep a careful tally of each player\u2019s scores as you play. Each player should announce his or her score after adding it up and then the score keeper should write it down right away. Watch for Premium Score squares. Premium Squares will alter your word scores, so pay attention to these when you play words. You can only use the bonus from a Premium Square if you laid the tile over that square during the current turn. You cannot incorporate bonuses from Premium Squares that you already counted in a different turn or that were counted by a different player. When adding the bonuses for plays with multiple Premium Squares, add the letter bonuses in before the word bonuses. For example, if you spell a word that has a double letter bonus and a triple word bonus, add the double letter bonus to your total before multiplying the total by three. Get 50 points added to your word score if you get a bingo, also known as a bonus. A bingo is when you use all seven of your tiles to play a word. When this happens, you should add up the total value of your word plus any bonuses gained from Premium Squares and then add 50 points. Add up each player\u2019s scores at the end of the game. After all of the players have exhausted their tiles or cannot play any more words, add up each player\u2019s points total. As the score keeper adds the totals, each player should let him or her know the points value (if any) of the tiles he or she has left over. Deduct this value from each player\u2019s points total to determine each player\u2019s final score. Announce the winner. After the score keeper has added each player\u2019s scores and deducted the values of any unused tiles, he or she may announce the winner. The person who has the highest score wins the game. Second place goes to the person with the second-highest score, and so on. Finding People to Play With Invite friends over for a friendly game. Scrabble is a fun game that is easy to learn, so it\u2019s a great way to spend time with friends. Invite a few of your friends over for a Scrabble night. You will get lots of practice and it will make for a fun evening. Join a Scrabble club. Perhaps you want to play Scrabble on a weekly basis.
