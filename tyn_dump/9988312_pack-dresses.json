Ashley Moon, MA\t\t\tOrganizational Coach & Consultant, Creatively Neat\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: The best way to keep a dress wrinkle-free is to place it on a hanger. If your dress doesn't have straps or extra hanging ribbons attached, you can neatly fold the dress and slide it through a suit hanger. The only dresses you can try folding or rolling are thick-fabric dresses without sleeves."
