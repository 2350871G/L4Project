The more you can maneuver your cube, the faster you can solve it. Experiment with algorithms to help you solve your cube faster.

Algorithms are codes made up of different movement combinations, and many different algorithms can be used to speed up the time it takes to solve. Master the CFOP Method. CFOP (also known as the Advanced Fridrich method) is the most popular method for speedsolving. There are four steps to this method: White cross, first two layers (F2L), orient last layer (OLL), and permute last layer (PLL). Reducing Delays Between Moves Plan ahead to reduce delays between your moves. Scramble the cube, and then take a second to notice the details before you start trying to solve. Think about your first few moves before you solve it. A little planning can help increase your speed by cutting down on the seconds spend deciding where to move next. For example, if you're using the Fridrich Method, practice your first two layers. While you're solving one pair, look ahead to find your next pair. This eliminates any pauses in between your moves. Practice as much as possible to master your cube. To be a speed solver, you must practice and practice some more. The more familiar you are with the cube and your moves, the easier it will be to speed up your solving time. Aim to solve your cube in under 10 seconds, but have patience. If you get to be this speedy, you might be a contender for some world records! However, learn at your own pace to begin with. Understand that it takes time to master the moves and solve the cube super fast. Using Finger Tricks Learn finger tricks and shortcuts to perform faster moves. Finger tricks are extremely fast moves performed with only one finger. These shortcuts can reduce your solving time by up to 10 moves per second. Try U, R, L, and B moves. Finger tricks are easier to complete if your Rubik\u2019s cube is lubricated Perform U moves by using the index finger of both hands. Push the top layer in your desired direction while keeping your other fingers away from the top layer. Complete R moves by holding the right face with your right hand. Keep your thumb on the bottom edge and your first three fingers on the top three pieces. Hold the cube with your left hand. Rotate your right wrist to perform the R and R2 move. Do L moves with the same method as R, just inverted. Instead, use your left hand and hold the left face. Perform B moves by rotating the puzzle so the B face is on top.
