Use your hands to bend the pin above the pearl at approximately an 80 degree angle. Hold with round nose pliers. Grip the bent wire with round nose pliers directly above the pearl. Make a loop. Start making a loop by bending the headpin clockwise around the tip of the round nose pliers. Adjust your pliers if you need to. Bend the wire until you have a complete loop. The loop should not be very large. It should wrap nicely around the round nose pliers so that it\u2019s just the circumference of the end of the pliers. Cut off the excess wire. Use wire cutters to cut off the extra wire that does not form part of the loop. Cut above the loop so that just the loop is remaining. Always protect your eyes with safety goggles when cutting wire. Open the loop slightly. Using your round nose pliers, open the loop just enough to slide the French hooks onto the loop. Close the loop.
