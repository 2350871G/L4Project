Trace the outline of the blade on the Kydex with a pencil, adding 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the perimeter. This does not need to be an exact measurement, but it is always better to err on the side of caution and make the sheath bigger than it needs to be. Making the sheath bigger than it needs to be allows you to trim it down when the time comes. If you make the sheath too small, you won\u2019t be able to add Kydex to make it bigger. You don\u2019t want your Kydex sheath to cover the hilt because that will prevent you from taking the knife out of the sheath easily."
