If you can\u2019t find the exact color of wax you need, get the closest colors. Get a lighter brown and a darker brown, for instance, to mix to the shade you need. Wax sticks are the best way to fill in deeper scratches and gouges, especially if you can\u2019t find a putty in the right shade you need.

If you need to color match the wax to your floor, start with the lightest color and work up to the darkest. Apply the wax a little bit at a time to get it to the color you desire.

        "Take some of the wrapping off of each bar you plan on using to fill in the scratch.",
        "Then, turn on the burn-in knife if you have one.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a melter, find an alternative way to melt the wax, such as by warming up a knife or by holding a butane lighter or torch close to it.",
        "Another way to fill in gaps in the floor is by using a crayon.",
        "Remove the wrapper, then melt it in the microwave.",
        "Rub the melted wax over the gaps for an easier but slightly less effective way of repairing scratches.",
        "Rub the melted wax into the scratch using the knife.",
        "Press the burn-in knife against the wax bar to melt a little bit of it, just enough to cover the tip.",
        "After you have some wax, press the knife\u2019s tip down on the scratch.",
        "Smear the wax across the scratch to fill it.",
        "Keep applying more wax as needed to fill in the damaged area.",
        "If you need to color match the wax to your floor, start with the lightest color and work up to the darkest.",
        "Apply the wax a little bit at a time to get it to the color you desire.",
        "You can mix different colors of wax directly in the crack.",
        "If you wish to do a test run first, mix the wax in a small container or on a scrap piece of paper, then move it into the scratch.",
        "Level out the filler with a credit card or another tool.",
        "Most kits come with a special tool you can rub over the scratch without scraping your floor.",
        "If you don\u2019t have this, get something solid, such as a stiff card or a putty knife.",
        "After waiting about 30 seconds for the wax to cool, hold your scraper on its side and brush it across the wax to remove the excess.",
        "Try to flatten out the scratched area as much as possible.",
        "Leaving a little overflow is okay, since you can always remove the excess wax before it dries.",
        "Buff the area with a paper towel to remove excess wax.",
        "Take your cloth and work carefully around the filled-in area.",
        "Wipe along the edges of the scratch and the applied filler.",
        "Doing this removes any excess wax left over while also blending the scratch in with the rest of the floor.",
        "Check your work by standing up and looking at the repair from a few different angles.",
        "If you repaired it well enough, you won\u2019t be able to spot it very easily.",
        "Make sure you got all of the wax outside of the scratch."
