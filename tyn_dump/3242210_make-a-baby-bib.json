As easy as bib patterns are to make yourself, you may want to use one already tested out. Find a free pattern download at http://www.lifewithmylittles.com/2015/07/best-and-easiest-bibs/. Choose fabric that is good for a baby. Pick something soft and absorbent, like terrycloth or one called minky fabric. Minky is extra soft for wiping around babies' mouth. Look for cotton fabric, since it won't irritate your babies skin and is hypoallergenic. Cutting Out the Pieces Pin the pattern to your first piece of fabric. You will need two pieces of fabric total, one for each side of the bib. Pin your pattern parallel to the perimeter of the fabric with sewing pins that are spaced about four inches apart. Cut the fabric around your pattern. It\u2019s best to use scissors designed for and used solely on fabric. Simply cut the fabric around your pinned pattern with sharp scissors, so it doesn\u2019t fray. Repeat step two and three with your second piece of fabric. Use a complementary pattern for the fabric on the back of your bib. You can also use the same fabric you decided to use for the front. Pin both fabric pieces together. Take both pieces of cut fabric and lay them together so the right sides are facing each other. Place your pins parallel to the edges and about an inch from the perimeter. Place as many pins as you think is necessary to keep the fabric pieces securely together. Sewing the Bib Together Sew around your bib, but leave a gap at the bottom. Use a sewing machine to stitch around the pinned pieces of fabric. Place your stitch as close to the edges as possible. Do not sew all the way around the bib. Leave two inches of space open at the bottom. Turn the bib right side out. Grab ahold of the two inches you left open at the bottom, and turn the fabric right side out.
