Plums should be frozen when they are at the peak of their ripeness, deliciously sweet and flavorful. Don't freeze plums that are a little green or overripe, because they won't have good flavor or texture when you thaw them out. Do a taste test before freezing a batch of plums. Bite into one of the plums. If purply-red juice drips down your chin, and the plum is sweet and flavorful, the rest are probably good to freeze. If it's too tart, or too grainy, you might not want to freeze this batch of plums. If the plums are a little hard, you can leave them at room temperature for a few days to ripen. Freeze them when they are just ripe."
