It tends to be sold at varying stages of ripeness, which impacts the strength of its taste but its texture usually remains the same, hard and grainy. Pecorino: this is a sharp, salty-flavoured cheese. Pecorino tends to be most widely available after considerable aging or ripening. Pecorino is hard like Parmesan and grates well. It is also possible to get a softer Pecorino, however, and this is where it can differ from Parmesan in texture. If you purchase fresher, younger Pecorino, you will discover that it is softer, with a lighter colouring and a texture similar to a firm Brie. It also tastes less strong."
