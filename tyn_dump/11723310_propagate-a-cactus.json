Press the plastic wrap tightly against the tray so it stays in place. The plastic wrap helps keep the growing medium humid so the seeds are more likely to germinate. Set the tray inside a container filled halfway with water. Choose a waterproof container that\u2019s about 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer on each side than the planting tray and has the same depth. Put the tray in the middle of the container, and begin adding water to the container. When the water reaches halfway up the sides of the tray, stop filling it. The water will absorb through the drainage holes in the bottom of the tray to provide the seeds with moisture. Don\u2019t overfill the container, or else the seeds could get waterlogged or wash out of the growing medium. Keep the tray in an area with 6 hours of indirect sunlight that stays over 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C). Carefully carry the tray and set it in a spot that gets sunlight throughout the day, such as a patio or south-facing window sill. Make sure the temperatures stay over 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C), or else the seeds may not grow properly. Leave the tray alone while the seeds germinate. You do not need to add more water to the container while the seeds germinate. Water droplets may form on the plastic wrap, but they will not negatively affect the seeds. Remove the plastic wrap when you see seedlings. Check the tray weekly to see if cactus seedlings sprout from the growing medium, which usually takes about 2\u20133 weeks. Once you notice the seedlings form, take off the plastic wrap to reduce the humidity so they don\u2019t develop rot. Keep the seedlings in the tray while they grow. If the growing medium feels dry to the touch and the container is out of water, lightly mist the medium with water. Grafting Cacti Remove the top off of a potted cactus so the stalk is 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) tall. Choose a healthy cactus that doesn\u2019t have any diseases or blemishes. Hold the cactus with a pair of tongs and carefully slice horizontally through the stalk with a serrated knife. Be sure to leave at least 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of the stalk, or else you may stunt its growth later on. You can also hold the cactus with a pair of gardening gloves for better control. Cut a 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) off the top of a different cactus to use as a scion. Select the cactus you want to propagate and find a healthy section that doesn\u2019t have any disease or damage. Hold the blade of a serrated knife horizontally at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) down from the top of the cactus and slice through the stalk. The piece you just cut will be the scion, or the part of the cactus that you\u2019re grafting onto another stalk. You can graft any type of cacti to another. If you\u2019re grafting multiple cacti, disinfect the knife blade with a 10% bleach solution when you switch plants so you don\u2019t spread any diseases. Set the scion on top of the cut stalk so the rings on the inside line up. Look at the cut portion of the scion to find a light green ring in the center. Locate the ring on the cut stalk in the pot as well. Place the cut scion on the stalk and position the interior rings so they overlap. Press the scion down with light pressure so it firmly sticks to the stalk. The rings inside the cacti are called the vascular cambium and allow water and nutrients to travel throughout the plants. If you don\u2019t line up the rings on the cacti, the graft will not successfully grow. Secure the scion to the stalk and pot with pieces of twine. Cut 2 pieces of twine that are long enough to wrap around the top of the scion and underneath the bottom of the pot. Tie one of the pieces of twine around the scion so it presses tightly against the stalk, but not so tight that it cuts through it. Then position the second piece of twine perpendicular to the first one so the scion doesn\u2019t slide around. Be careful that the scion doesn\u2019t move or shift while you\u2019re tying it, or else the rings may not line up anymore. Keep the grafted cactus in a south-facing window with 6 hours of sun. Place the cactus pot on a window sill so it gets indirect sunlight throughout the day. If you don\u2019t have a south-facing window, you can also keep the cactus in a shady area in your yard or on a patio. Be careful not to disturb the cactus after grafting the pieces together since it could affect how well it heals. Keep the cactus indoors if there\u2019s any risk for frost or snow since it could cause the cactus to die. Water the cactus when the soil feels dry. Stick your finger in the soil to see if it feels dry 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) below the surface. If it still feels damp, leave the pot alone. If it\u2019s dry, fill a watering can with fresh, clean water and pour it directly into the soil. Avoid letting the water pool on the surface since you could cause the cactus to rot. Cacti are prone to overwatering and may not survive if the soil stays damp. Remove the twine after 1 month. Be careful as you untie the twine since the cactus may still be fragile and could easily get damaged. Take off both pieces and continue caring for the cactus as normal now that the pieces have joined together.",
