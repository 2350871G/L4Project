Expert Answer\t\t\t\t\t\tQ\t\t\t\tWhen asked, \"How often should you clean your dishwasher?\" Chris Willatt\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCleaning Guru\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willatt is the owner and founder of Alpine Maids, a cleaning agency in Denver, Colorado started in 2015.

EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tChris Willatt, the owner of Alpine Maids, says: \"About once a month, take out your filter and clean it regularly to remove the deposits that detergent and hard water can leave behind. Then, every 6 months or so, you should deep clean the inside of the dishwasher as well.\""

        "Most filter systems consist of several interlocking parts.",
        "Check your owner\u2019s manual for precise instructions on how to remove them.",
        "The filter grinds up larger food scraps so they don\u2019t get caught in the drain.",
        "This means the filter can easily get clogged and start to stink, so check it often to keep it in working order.",
        "Scrub the filter parts with a brush under warm water.",
        "Rinse each part off individually in the sink to remove as much solid matter as possible.",
        "Wipe the components down with a paper towel or sponge, then check them over for remaining debris.",
        "You may still notice clogs from smaller particles like dirt and coffee grounds.",
        "Use a kitchen brush or old toothbrush to knock this debris off the filter.",
        "If you have a faucet or hose with a strong spray setting, make use of it to eliminate debris in tough to reach areas.",
        "Remove the spray arm from the dishwasher and rinse it.",
        "Even if your dishwasher doesn\u2019t have a separate filter, it will have a spray arm.",
        "Look in the center of the floor.",
        "The sprayer looks like a plastic propeller blade.",
        "All you have to do is lift it up to pop it off of its moorings.",
        "Then, clean it off under warm water in the sink.",
        "Wipe away any food particles you see so they cannot clog the sprayer\u2019s holes.",
        "Clear the spray arm\u2019s holes with a toothpick.",
        "The series of holes on top of the spray arm disperse water into the dishwasher\u2019s compartment.",
        "You may also see another hole on the underside that shoots water into the filter.",
        "These holes can get clogged sometimes, so you will need to pick out the food particles before reinstalling the sprayer and filter.",
        "You can also use hanging wire or wood skewers to clear the holes.",
        "If your dishes don\u2019t seem to get very wet or clean when you operate the dishwasher, a clogged spray arm may be the cause.",
        "Removing Tough Stains and Odors Place a cup of white vinegar on the top rack.",
        "Put the dish racks and other components back in the dishwasher if you took them out for cleaning.",
        "Then, choose a dishwasher-safe container such as a bowl or measuring cup.",
        "Fill it with up to 2 cups (470 mL) of vinegar for a safe and efficient way to give your dishwasher a deep cleaning.",
        "Vinegar is effective at removing stubborn grease and grime as well as bad odors.",
        "Try using it if you can\u2019t get your dishwasher pristine with soap and water alone.",
        "You can also use store-bought cleaners.",
        "Many liquid additives are stronger than vinegar and more effectively treat mineral discolorations.",
        "Run a rinse cycle using the hottest water setting possible.",
        "Close the dishwasher door and set it for a normal cycle.",
        "The hot water will dilute and disperse the vinegar, giving your dishwasher more of a shine.",
        "When the cycle ends, let the water drain, then check to see how clean your dishwasher looks.",
        "You may need to run the dishwasher through multiple cycles before it is completely clean and odorless.",
        "Add more vinegar as necessary.",
        "Sprinkle baking soda on the dishwasher floor for additional cleaning.",
        "Baking soda is an effective way to remove tough stains and odors left over after a vinegar wash.",
        "Distribute 1 cup (180 g) of baking soda evenly over the bottom of the dishwasher.",
        "Pull the dishwashing racks and caddies out so you can spread the baking soda, but don\u2019t remove them.",
        "Baking soda is slightly abrasive, so it will clear up any food particles remaining in the dishwasher.",
        "Set the dishwasher for a short cycle with hot water.",
        "Since baking soda is abrasive, avoid using it in longer rinse cycles.",
        "For a thorough cleaning, use the hottest water setting possible.",
        "When the cycle ends, the dishwasher may be spotless and odorless.",
        "If the dishwasher still isn\u2019t clean, you may need to use a stronger cleaner.",
        "More vinegar, lemon juice, or a commercial cleaner can help.",
        "Avoid using more baking soda.",
        "Spread bleach on the dishwasher\u2019s floor to get rid of  moldy stains.",
        "Ugly green, brown, or black spots are signs of mold.",
        "Vinegar and baking soda may not be enough to cleanse them.",
        "Instead, pull out the dish racks so you can access the dishwasher\u2019s interior.",
        "Distribute \u20442 cup (120 mL) of bleach evenly across the floor, then put the racks back into position.",
        "If your dishwasher is stainless steel, avoid using bleach!",
        "Bleach will cause serious damage.",
        "Instead, scrub the spots off with plenty of warm water, soap, and commercial cleansers.",
        "Use no more than 1 cup (240 mL) of bleach at a time.",
        "Be careful, since bleach is caustic and the fumes are unpleasant to breathe in.",
        "Run the dishwasher on a normal, full cycle to finish cleaning it.",
        "Close the door and turn on the dishwasher.",
        "Set it for a medium-length wash cycle using hot water.",
        "The water will dilute the bleach so it doesn\u2019t damage your dishwasher\u2019s interior.",
        "Bleach is the most effective way of eliminating mold and mildew spores.",
        "Have some available in case vinegar and baking soda do not work.",
        "Never mix bleach with vinegar.",
        "Combined, the products create toxic chlorine gas.",
        "Use each cleaner separately, rinsing out the dishwasher each time."
