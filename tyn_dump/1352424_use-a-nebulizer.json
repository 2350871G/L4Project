Many types of respiratory medications for nebulizer treatments come in pre-measured doses. If yours is not pre-measured, measure out the exact amount prescribed for one dose. Secure the top tightly  to prevent the medication from spilling out. Don't forget to plug the air compressor into an electrical outlet if it is not battery operated. Medications that can be put in the nebulizer include inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergics, inhaled glucocorticoids, and inhaled antibiotics. Other inhaled medications are available for the treatment of non-respiratory diseases. Not all drugs can be aerosolized. The jet, or pneumatic, nebulizer is the most common type. Newer nebulizers are designed to deliver the entire mediation during inhalation. Nebulizer performance can be affected by nebulizer method, mechanism of aerosol formation, and drug formation. If you need instructions about how to use your nebulizer, talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist."
