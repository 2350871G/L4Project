Take note of different types of buildings while you\u2019re out and about to get inspiration and refine your mental image, or use your imagination to come up with your own one-of-a-kind structure. If you can envision it, you can build it. If you plan on modeling a real building, take plenty of photographs so you\u2019ll have something to refer to throughout the design phase. A simple house, barn, or other traditional structure will be the easiest to create on your first attempt. As your skills improve, you might try your hand at elaborate mansions, skyscrapers, castles, and other types of buildings.Tip: Feel free to modify the design of an existing structure in any way you see fit to make it more manageable for your skill level and the materials you\u2019re working with."

        "If you\u2019re using styrene, wood, or gel foam, make a shallow cut down your roof point line and bend the sections of material on either side away from one another to create a hinge.",
        "This technique works best for basic gable, gambrel, and skillion roofs made up of only a couple planes.",
        "If you\u2019ve chosen a more complex roof style for your model, you may have no choice but to cut and paste.",
        "Change out the blade on your utility knife as soon as it gets dull.",
        "The friction of cutting and scoring will begin to dull your cutting tool after a while.",
        "When you begin encountering resistance or notice that your cuts feel rough, stop what you\u2019re doing and very carefully remove the blade you\u2019re currently working with.",
        "Replace the dull blade with a fresh one and get back to it\u2014you\u2019ll feel the difference right away.",
        "If you\u2019re using a retractable utility knife, open up the casing and lift out the old blade by its rear edge to avoid cutting yourself accidentally.",
        "Some newer blades come loaded with pre-notched blades, which make it possible to snap off the dull section and extend a brand new, ultra-sharp tip.",
        "Cutting with a dull blade can tire you out quickly, and is much more likely to damage your work materials.",
        "Assembling and Finishing Your Model Glue your model together where its various planes meet.",
        "Apply a thin strip of high-hold craft glue or a similar adhesive to the edges of your first piece.",
        "Line up the glued edge with the corresponding edge of the neighboring piece and press and hold the two edges together.",
        "Allow the glue to dry for 15-20 seconds before letting go and moving on to the next piece.",
        "You can also use a hot glue gun, super glue, or ordinary white glue on wood and most types of cardstock and board.",
        "To streamline the gluing process, start by putting the outer walls in place around the floor piece, then attach any interior walls you wish to include, saving the roof for last.Tip: Gluing is one of the most time-consuming parts of model-building, but also one of the most important.",
        "Take your time and make sure each seam and connection is as clean and precise as possible.",
        "Apply a thin layer of clay to the outer surface of your model (optional).",
        "Press small lumps of soft modeling clay onto the skeleton of your structure, working in 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) patches.",
        "Once you\u2019ve covered the entire structure, spread and flatten the clay with the pads of your fingers until it\u2019s an even thickness all over.",
        "Be careful not to crush, bend, or otherwise damage the underlying material.",
        "Pinch the clay gently where the separate planes of your model come together to create sharper corners and edges.",
        "Any type of standard modeling or air dry clay will work just fine for most projects.",
        "Be sure to select a neutral color if you intend to paint your finished model.",
        "Carve textures and fine details into the clay with your utility knife.",
        "Hold the knife the way you would a pen or pencil and use the point of the blade to etch masonry stones, staggered board lines, or tiny brickwork patterns.",
        "Study photos of the type of the surfaces and materials you\u2019re replicating to make sure they look authentic.",
        "You can also use your utility knife to \u201cdraw\u201d on roof tiles, window sills, roof flashing, and other realistic features.",
        "If you\u2019d rather not go to the trouble of carving everything by hand, consider purchasing a sheet of embossed vinyl or plastic printed in the exterior finish of your choice.",
        "These basically work like stickers\u2014just cut them to fit the shape of your building\u2019s walls, floor, or roof and smooth them on.",
        "Paint your finished model for added realism.",
        "A detailed paint job will give your model a more lifelike quality.",
        "Pick up as many shades as you need to lend a splash of color to your building\u2019s many features.",
        "You\u2019ll need gray for raw stone, dark red for brick, brown or tan for wood, black for roofing tiles, silver for metal, bright colors for siding, shutters, and other painted portions, and so on.",
        "If you used air dry clay to cover your model, you\u2019ll need to heat-cure the clay before you apply paint.",
        "To do this, place the model in the oven on its lowest setting for 15-20 minutes at a time, allowing the oven to cool completely between rounds to prevent the clay from burning.",
        "Continue in this way until it feels dry and solid to the touch.",
        "Acrylic, tempera, or poster paint is usually the best choice for applying to clay."
