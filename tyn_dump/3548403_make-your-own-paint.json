Since you will be working with paint pigments and a medium, protect yourself by wearing a mask or respirator. You may also want to cover your arms by wearing long-sleeved clothing. The paints are non-toxic unless you use metal-based pigments like \u201ccadmium red.\u201d However, these paints are not meant for use on skin. Pour raw color pigment onto a flat mixing surface. You will need dry paint pigment in the color you wish to make. Pour about 1 tablespoon, or \u20442 ounce (14 g), of pigment onto a mixing surface such as a paint palette or slab. You can find dry paint pigment at art supply stores. Each pigment has a visible color and is labeled appropriately, such as Titanium White or Red Iron. Many artists use glass or stone slabs. You may be able to find plexiglass at a home improvement store and use that to mix your paint. Pour 2 drops of water if you want to smooth out the pigment. Adding a little bit of water can help you get the paint to the proper consistency. Spread the paint to create space in the center of the pigment pile. Using a pipette or eye dropper, squeeze 2 or 3 drops of water into the space. If the pigment isn\u2019t completely smooth, the paint may look grainy once you use it later. Mix the paint and water with a palette knife. Use a palette knife or spatula to spread the water throughout the pigment. Mix the paint until it has a smooth, sauce-like consistency. Try to eliminate any clumps of raw pigment you see. You might not be able to remove all the lumps right away. This is okay, since you will get another chance to thin the paint. If you make your own paint often, consider purchasing a paint muller online or from an art supply store. A paint muller grinds and disperses raw pigment. Add your paint medium to the pigment. Start with approximately 2 tablespoons, or  1 fl. oz., of your liquid paint medium. The medium you choose depends on what type of paint you want to make. Art supply stores sell different mediums for acrylics, or you can get a plant-based oil to make oil paint. For example, you can use a gloss medium to make thin, transparent acrylic paint. For oil paint, use linseed, walnut, or poppy oil. Mix the paint and add more of the medium for consistency. Use your palette knife or spatula to combine the pigment and medium. When the paint is at the proper consistency, it will appear smooth, firm, and a little glossy. Adjust the paint by adding more of the medium as necessary until it reaches the consistency you desire. Add the medium gradually while mixing it into the paint. Check the consistency frequently so you don't add too much. Excess paint may be spread onto tin foil, wrapped up tightly, and preserved in a freezer for at least 2 or 3 months. Creating Chalk Paint for Furniture Mix water and baking soda together in a bowl. Pour 1.5 fluid ounces (44 ml) of cool water into a mixing bowl. Make sure you use tap water below room temperature. Next, add about 4 ounces (110 g) of baking soda. This paint is an inexpensive way to give furniture an aged, distressed look. The paint is non-toxic, but swallowing it can make you feel temporarily sick. The paint can also be made with Plaster of Paris or unsanded grout instead of baking soda. Use 4 ounces (110 g) of either substance. Stir the mixture until it looks smooth. Swirl the mixture in the bowl with a mixing spoon or another utensil. Continue mixing until all of the baking soda disperses. The liquid should look completely smooth. Pour the mixture into a cup of latex paint. Pour about 8 fluid ounces (240 ml) of a latex paint into a paint bowl. The paint can be any color you want. Then, add the baking soda and water mixture into the paint, stirring it with a paint mixing stick. You can get latex paint at a home improvement store. Make sure it is latex-based. Oil paints are different and dry slower. Spread the paint onto furniture with a paint brush. The chalk paint will come out smooth like any regular latex paint. It needs to be applied right away to any furniture you wish to color. Coat the furniture with the paint to give it a chalky, distressed appearance. The paint will begin drying within a few hours. Wait about a day to ensure it dries completely. After the paint dries, you can sand it even with 180 to 220-grit sandpaper. To dispose of excess paint, leave it out in the open. Since it is made with latex paint, it will dry. Then you can throw it in the trash. Making Flour-Based Wall Paint Mix cold water and flour into a mixing bowl. Make the mixture with cold water. Pour 16 fluid ounces (470 ml) of water into a bowl. Combine it with about 16 ounces (450 g) of flour, stirring until the mixture is smooth. This mixture will create an inexpensive, non-toxic paint that can be used to give walls and other surfaces a matte finish. This paint is similar to store-bought paints, so it will last for many years. Boil 12 fluid ounces (350 ml) of water on the stove. Pour about 1 \u00bd cups of water into a pot safe to be heated on a stove. Turn the heat on the stove up to high and wait for the water to boil. Turn the heat down and stir the mixture into a paste. Lower the heat, stirring the mixture continually with a whisk or another mixing tool. The mixture should turn into a thick paste within 3 to 5 minutes. Once it becomes a paste, remove it from the heat. Check the paste\u2019s consistency to ensure that it is thick. If it seems runny, give it more cooking time. Stir 16 fluid ounces (470 ml) of cold water into the paste. Use only cold water so the paste doesn\u2019t thin out too much. Slowly pour it onto the paste, mixing the entire time. The water will thin the paste to a paint-like consistency as you stir.. Adding the water too quickly can thin the paste out more than you want, so it won\u2019t be thick enough to cover your walls. Mix screened clay and powder filler in a separate bowl. In a mixing bowl, combine about 8 ounces (230 g) of screened clay filler with 4 ounces (110 g) of a powder filler such as mica or iron sulfate. These ingredients give the paint color and stability, preventing unsightly peeling and cracking on your walls. Screened clay can be ordered online or from landscaping companies. Powder fillers are often available at home improvements stores and can also be purchased online. Add the filler material to the paste. Slowly add the clay mixture to the paste, stirring it the entire time. Mix the ingredients together until the paste reaches the consistency you desire. You can then spread it over your paint surface with brushes like you would with any regular latex or oil paint. You can thin the paint further by boiling it for up to 30 minutes, then mixing in about 32 fluid ounces (950 ml) of linseed oil. Let it cool to the touch before using it. Use the paint and store the excess in a sealed container. Brush the paint over your painting surface, then wait for the paint to set. The paint will dry out in about 1 hour and cure within 24 hours. You may then wish to give your painting surface a second coating to make it look great. Move the excess to a sealed container, such as a paint can, in a closet, garage, or similar area. Properly-stored paint should last 5 to 10 years. You can also leave the excess paint out in the open to dry, then dispose of it in the trash.",
