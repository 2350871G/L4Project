Be careful in how you share the gospel. People might think that you are imposing your beliefs on them--and even scarier, in some cases you just might be. As Saint Francis of Assisi said, \"Preach the Gospel at all times, and when necessary, use words.\" The best way to spread the Word is by acting as a Christian. Be kind to others when they are mean to you etc. You'll be less likely to run into difficult situations this way."
