Check the \"Tips\" section for information on making slip knots and chain stitches. You can vary the length of this foundation chain, but make sure that your chains equal a number divisible by your intended groupings plus one. A standard grouping will be five stitches, so your chain count should be a multiple of five plus one extra: 21, 26, 31, 36, etc. The extra chain will be your turning chain. You won't work into it, so in essence, it only exists to make the edge of  the lace look smoother. Crochet thread will give your lace a light, delicate appearance. If you want to crochet thicker lace, though, you can use a lightweight or worsted weight yarn instead of thread. Keep in mind that a heavier yarn will require a larger crochet hook, as well."
