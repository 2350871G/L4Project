Remove the shade, bulb, and the wire that holds the shade in place. At this point, the socket at the top of the lamp should be exposed. On most lamps, this is where the switch is located. Squeeze and pull the socket shell to remove it from the lamp. The socket shell is the actual assembly where the switch is located and the light bulb screws in.

If the lamp doesn't come on, check the connection in your switch and try again. If this doesn't help, you may need to replace the plug. Replacing a Cord Switch Look for printing on the lamp cord to determine the size switch you need. Look for printing which says either SPT-1 or SPT-2. The printing is small, so you might have to look carefully. The difference between SPT-1 and SPT-2 involves the thickness of the lamp cord. Examine your new switch to see which wires you have to cut. Some switches only require you to connect the hot wire. If this is the case, there will be a channel along one side of the switch for the neutral wire. Remove the existing cord switch. You may be able to open the casing of the existing switch and remove the wires without cutting them, but if not, use wire cutters to cut as close to the switch as you can. Try to avoid cutting the neutral wire. If you have to cut it in order to remove the old switch, strip the insulation and connect the cut ends of the neutral wire together.
