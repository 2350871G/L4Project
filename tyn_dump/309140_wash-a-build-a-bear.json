The cold water will help preserve your bear\u2019s color. You can also use warm, but never hot, water. Do not use any harsh detergents, as they can damage the bear\u2019s fur. Baby detergents work well. Place the bear into the soapy water and agitate. Simply swish the bear around in the soap and water mixture until it is completely covered. Scrub the bear gently with the soapy water using your hands. Take care around the stitches so they don\u2019t come loose. Hand-washing is the gentlest method for cleaning the bear. Washing too roughly may cause the stuffing to come out of the stitching. Remove the bear from the dirty water and rinse. Use cold running water to rinse the suds off of your bear. Lay the bear on a clean towel, dabbing it with another towel to get rid of excess moisture. Follow by brushing your bear with a soft brush.

Make sure the bear is completely dry before boxing it up or letting a child play with it. Washing in Washing Machine Secure your bear in a cotton pillowcase. A pillowcase is porous and won\u2019t do any damage to your bear\u2019s fur. Make sure that the case is tied securely so the bear doesn\u2019t fall out in the wash cycle. Wash the bear in a gentle cycle. Use a mild detergent and cold water. Treat the bear carefully, as using a rough cycle can cause damages.

You may also use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process. It is not advisable to dry your bear in the dryer. Refreshing with a Spot Clean Mix a quarter capful of oxygen stain remover into a bowl of warm water. Make sure that the stain remover and water are thoroughly mixed. This method is best used on bears with a voice box. The oxygen stain remover will help get rid of any difficult spots, but a mild detergent will also work. Saturate the dirty spot with the mixture. Completely cover the spot with the water and stain remover liquid. Rub the mixture into the bear with a clean towel. Wait 5-10 minutes for the mixture to absorb, but don\u2019t let it dry completely. Use small, circular motions to rub the mixture into the spot. Blot the spot with a clean towel. If it is still visible, repeat the first four steps. You can also use a paper towel for blotting. Depending on the nature of each spot and how much the stain has soaked in, you may need to repeat the process. Rinse the spot with cold water and blot again with a clean towel. You may blot the bear until it is dry, or you can leave it to air dry.",
