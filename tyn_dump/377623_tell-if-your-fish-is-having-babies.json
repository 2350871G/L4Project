The males and females of these species mate, after which the females form eggs within their bodies. Over the course of a month or two (for most aquarium species), the eggs hatch into fish, and the mother gives birth.

Females tend to be more drab, with a triangular or fan-shaped anal fin. If you can identify their sex, you'll have an easier time telling whether two fish are fighting (typically two males or two females), or whether they are mating or preparing to mate (one male and one female). Some species are more difficult to tell apart, and may require an expert from an aquarium store."
