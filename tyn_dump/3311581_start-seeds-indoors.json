Plan to start most seeds 8 weeks before that frost date, with the expectation to plant them 2 weeks later.  Buy your seeds. Read the packets carefully. Seed starting times and germination rates vary greatly. Create a seed starting agenda. Plan to plant seeds with similar growing schedules near each other. For example, corn and beans can be planted earlier than flowers. Squash do not take transplantation well, so they can be started later and planted before root systems begin to develop. Containers and Soil Buy seed trays, if you want to plant a lot of seeds at once. These small plastic trays hold a few inches of dirt. They are easy to care for, but dry out quickly.

Warmth Place plastic forks on the edges of the seed tray and in the middle.  Wrap plastic wrap over the top of the fork tips. You are creating a greenhouse environment.
