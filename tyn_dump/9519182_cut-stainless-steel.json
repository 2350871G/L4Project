    "text": " Cutting Stainless Steel Sheets Use a circular saw. A circular saw is a handheld power saw with a circular blade. You can quickly cut through stainless steel with a circular saw if you use the right blade. Make sure you get a circular saw that can cut through sheet metal that\u2019s as thick as yours is. Get a diamond saw blade. Diamond saw blades are stronger than other saw blades you can use with a circular saw. Stainless steel is tougher to cut through than other metals, so you\u2019ll want something strong like a diamond saw blade for your saw. Once you get the blade, swap it out with the blade that\u2019s currently in your circular saw. Clamp your sheet metal down to a work table. Don\u2019t try to cut your stainless steel without clamping it down or it could shift when you\u2019re cutting it. Use clamps you can tighten, like F clamps, to secure the sheet metal to the table. The clamps should be tight enough that the sheet metal doesn't shift at all. Line up the saw blade with the section you want to cut and turn on the saw. Rest the flat base of the saw on the top of the sheet metal. Once the saw is on, slowly bring it across the top of the sheet metal, following the line you want to cut with the blade. It may help if you mark the line you want to cut beforehand. Wear protective eyewear and gloves while you\u2019re operating the circular saw. If you're trying to cut a perfectly straight line, lay a framing square on the sheet metal and press it against the flat base on the circular saw. As you're cutting, keep the base of the saw pressed against the edge of the framing square so the line you cut is straight. Turn off the saw when you\u2019re done making your cut. Be careful handling the cut edges of your stainless steel. If they're sharp, use a deburring tool to file them down. Cutting Stainless Steel Tubes Buy a stainless steel tube cutter. A stainless steel tube cutter is a handheld device that clamps around a tube of stainless steel and cuts it with a small rotating wheel. Make sure you get a tube cutter designed specifically for stainless steel. Some stainless steel tube cutters can cut through thicker tubes than others, so know the measurement of your tube before you buy one. Insert your stainless steel tube into the tube cutter. Line up the section you want to cut with the wheel on the cutter. Once your tube is in position, tighten it into place by rotating the knob at the end of the device. Keep rotating the knob until the tube is secure. Rotate the tube cutter around the tube until it cuts through it. Hold the exposed end of the tube in one hand and rotate the tube cutter with your other hand. As you rotate the tube cutter around the tube, the small wheel on the cutter will gradually cut through the tube. Eventually, the wheel will cut all the way through the tube and the piece of tube you cut will fall off. Remove the tube from the tube cutter. Rotate the knob at the end of the tube cutter if the tube is stuck. Be careful handling the cut edges of the tube. If the edges are sharp, file them down with a deburring tool. Cutting Stainless Steel Tiles Buy or rent a wet saw. A wet saw is a table saw that pumps out water onto the saw blade as you\u2019re using it. A wet saw is good for cutting stainless steel tiles because the water it pumps out cools off the stainless steel (which is prone to heating up quickly), making the tiles easier to cut. If you don\u2019t own a wet saw and you don\u2019t want to buy one, rent one from your local home improvement store instead. Use a diamond wet saw blade. Diamond wet saw blades are stronger than other metal cutting blades. Because stainless steel is an exceptionally strong and durable metal, a regular wet saw blade won\u2019t be as effective. Once you get the diamond blade, swap it out with the blade currently in the wet saw. Place your stainless steel tile face up on the wet saw table. Make sure the table is pulled back toward you and away from the blade. Line up the section of the tile you want to cut with the blade on the wet saw. Don't worry about clamping the tile down on the saw table. Turn on the wet saw and slowly push the table toward the blade. Use both of your hands to push the table, but make sure to keep them away from the blade. Don\u2019t rush and push the tile through the blade too quickly or it may not cut properly. Continue to slowly push the table toward the blade until the blade has cut all the way through the stainless steel tile. Make sure you\u2019re wearing protective eyewear while you\u2019re operating the wet saw. Turn off the wet saw and remove the cut tile. Be careful handling the edges of the cut tile as they may be sharp. If you\u2019re cutting multiple tiles, place another tile face up on the wet saw table and repeat the process. If any edges of the tiles are going to be exposed, use a deburring tool to file them down so they're not sharp.",
