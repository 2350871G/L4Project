It's fine if you need to leave the solution in the fridge for longer. Soaking the flaxseeds first isn't absolutely necessary, but it will increase how much gel you get. Distilled or filtered water has fewer additives, meaning your hair gel will likely last longer if you use one of these types of water. However, tap water will also work."

Styling Your Hair with Flaxseed Gel Add flaxseed gel to damp hair for soft curls with bounce. Squeeze a cherry-sized amount of gel into your hands and use your fingers to work it through your damp hair. Let your hair dry naturally for light and natural curls. You may need to use a touch more gel then you would with a commercial product, as flaxseed may not have quite as much hold. Use flaxseed gel in combination with other products for more definition.

This gel has good, natural hold, but if you need a bit more definition, you may want to add a pomade or another product. Flip your head upside down to add volume, scrunching the ends for curls. Get a cherry-sized amount in your hands and rub it into your palms. With damp hair, turn your head upside-down and run your hands through your hair from the roots. When you get to the ends, use your hands to squish them a bit to apply the gel and encourage curls. Flip your head back up and adjust your hair as needed.",
