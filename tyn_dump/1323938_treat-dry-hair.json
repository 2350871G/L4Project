                    "description": "When you have dry hair, washing too often can strip the moisture from your hair, causing your locks to become even more dehydrated. If you currently wash everyday, switch to every other day. If you wash every other day, switch to every third day. Wash as infrequently as possible to keep the moisture in your hair. If your roots start to look greasy or your hair is flat in between washes, use a dry shampoo to soak up excess oil and add texture to your locks.

Working with a person's hair gives you a really good feel for what they need on an individual level.

                    "description": "Traditional shampoos contain sulfates and other chemicals that dry out your hair. Instead of washing with shampoo, use a cleansing conditioner, which uses natural oils to cleanse and condition at the same time. They leave your hair feeling clean and moisturized. Make sure that your hair is completely saturated with water before you apply the cleansing conditioner. When you\u2019re using a cleansing conditioner, apply it from the roots to the ends. While a cleansing conditioner can keep your hair clean, you can still get buildup from styling products, deep conditioning treatments, and sweat. To get rid of it, use a clarifying shampoo every two to four weeks instead of the cleansing conditioner. If you don't want to use a cleansing conditioner, opt for a sulfate-free, natural shampoo. Look for a formula that contains ingredients such as argan oil, almond oil, coconut milk, honey, aloe vera, shea butter, and other organic naturals that won't strip your hair of moisture."
