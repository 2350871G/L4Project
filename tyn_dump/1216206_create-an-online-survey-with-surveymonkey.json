The real work comes in designing an effective survey that elicits the information you're really after. This means that you need to know, without a doubt, what it is that you're seeking. Creating a survey without having a clue as to what you want from it will simply waste the time of all involved. Moreover, if it's clear to survey takers that the survey is random, they're much more likely to avoid taking it, especially if it appears as spam. When designing your surveys content, bear the following in mind:\nWhen creating a survey, keep the questions relevant above all. Do not try to seek tangential information or those answering it will be surprised and possibly less candid.

Avoid using questions that are loaded (assumption-filled) or leading (directs the answer). Put sensitive or demographic questions at the end of the survey\u2013\u2013a survey taker is more likely to opt out early if these appear at the front.
