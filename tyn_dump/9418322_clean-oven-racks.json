    "text": " Using Ammonia Place the oven racks in a new trash bag with 2 cups (0.50  qt) of ammonia. It\u2019s best to choose a heavy-duty bag, to prevent rips and leaks, that\u2019s large enough to hold the racks. It\u2019s actually the fumes from the ammonia, not the liquid itself, that clean the racks, so you don\u2019t need more than 2 cups (0.50  qt). Seal the bag and let it sit outside overnight. Use tape or rubber bands to seal it securely and keep the fumes contained. Place the bag outside or in a garage or shed overnight, rather than keeping it in your home. If you absolutely cannot leave the bag outside, place it in the bathtub with the bathroom window open or ventilation fan on. Open the bag in the morning and remove the racks. Put on gloves and make sure you open the bag outside or in a well-ventilated area. Remove the racks and place them in the sink or tub. Flush the ammonia down the toilet or pour it down the drain with plenty of water and dispose of the bag in the garbage can. Rinse the racks thoroughly, then dry and replace them. Use hot water to rinse the gunk and ammonia off the racks. Dry them with a clean towel, then put them back in your oven. Soaking Racks in the Tub Set the racks on top of 6-8 dryer sheets in the tub. Spread 6-8 dryer sheets out along the bottom of your bathtub, then place the oven racks on top of them. The anti-static properties in dryer sheets help remove the baked-on gunk from the metal racks. You can do this one at a time or do all the racks at once. Cover the racks with hot water and add \u20444 cup (59 ml) of dish soap. Plug the tub and let the hot water run. Squirt in \u20444 cup (59 ml) of your everyday dish soap and agitate the water. Turn off the water when the racks are covered by several inches of water. Let the racks soak overnight.

Rinse and dry the racks before replacing them. Let the water out of the tub while scrubbing the racks, then rinse them with hot water. Dry the racks with a clean towel and then put them back in your oven. Spraying with a Commercial Cleaner Lay the racks outside on a sheet of plastic. It\u2019s important that you do this outside to let the fumes from the commercial cleaner dissipate. If you don\u2019t have a sheet of plastic, you could use newspaper or old towels instead. Lay the racks in a single layer rather than stacking them. Spray the racks with a commercial cleaner and let them soak for an hour. Put on gloves before spraying the cleaner. Flip each rack over and spray the other side as well. For best results, let the cleaner soak for an hour.
