Wear your safety glasses and gloves when you mix the bleach so you don\u2019t get any irritation. If you\u2019re using oxalic acid, mix the crystals in water following the directions on the package. If you\u2019re using 2-part bleach, then pour equal amounts of both parts of the bleach in a small bowl and stir them together. Oxalic acid lightens the stain slightly and works best on naturally light woods. A 2-part bleach solution removes most of the color, and it also can lighten the natural color of dark wood. Both types of bleach will work on either oil-based or water-based stain. You can buy wood bleach and oxalic acid from hardware or home improvement stores."
