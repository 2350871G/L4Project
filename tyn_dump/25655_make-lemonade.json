Twist the lemon halves over the press to get as much juice out as possible. Microwave your lemons for 10-20 seconds to soften the pulp and get more juice. If you don't have a lemon press, squeeze the lemon to get most of the juice out. Then, press a fork or mixer beater into the lemon pulp and twist it to release the rest of the juice.
