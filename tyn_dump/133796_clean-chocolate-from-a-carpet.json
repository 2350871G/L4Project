As with most stains, the longer you leave it, the tougher it will be to remove. Remove excess chocolate. You can use a paper towel to blot excess chocolate, or scrape it gently with a dull knife. If you choose to use a knife, place the removed chocolate onto a paper towel. Wipe the knife frequently to avoid smearing or grinding in the chocolate. If the chocolate is soft, chill it with an ice cube or frozen package to make it easier to chip out with the knife. Check the carpet type.

Stop and call a professional. Put on a pair of rubber gloves. These will protect your hands from the chemicals in the cleaning solutions. You may also want to put on an old t-shirt just in case any other cleaning solutions splashes onto your clothing. Cleaning a Synthetic Fiber Carpet with Detergent Make a detergent solution. Combine 0.25  tsp (1.2 mL) translucent liquid dishwashing detergent, like Joy or Dawn, with 8  fl oz (240 mL) of lukewarm water. Apply the detergent solution. Dip a white cloth or paper towel into the detergent solution and blot the stain. Then, press the cloth or paper towel into the stain for several seconds. Wait for 15 minutes as the detergent dissolves the stain, then use a clean, dry white cloth or paper towel to remove excess liquid. Remember to perform a patch test before applying the detergent.

Dampen a sponge with cool water and gently blot the stain several times. Make and apply a diluted carpet shampoo solution. To make your carpet shampoo solution, mix 1 part liquid carpet shampoo with 4 parts water. Apply the solution to the stain with a brush or a towel. Again, remember to do a quick patch test to ensure the solution won\u2019t damage your rug. Vacuum. Allow the area to dry completely, then vacuum to remove the stain. If the stain persists, repeat steps 1-3. If you cannot remove the stain, consider calling a carpet cleaning company. Cleaning a Natural Fiber Carpet with Detergent Make and apply a detergent solution. Combine 1  tsp (4.9 mL) translucent liquid dishwashing detergent with one cup of lukewarm water. Spray the solution on the stain with spray bottle and blot with a white paper towel or cloth. Follow up with ammonia solution. Combine one tablespoon of clear, white ammonia with 4  fl oz (120 mL) of lukewarm water. Spray the solution on the stain and blot with a white paper towel or cloth. Before starting, make sure that the room is well ventilated, so that you don't breathe in too much ammonia. Follow up with vinegar solution. Make a vinegar solution by combining 2  fl oz (59 mL) of white vinegar with 2  fl oz (59 mL) of water. Spray the solution on the stain and blot with a dry, white paper towel or cloth. Re-apply the detergent solution. Spray the solution on the stain and blot with a dry, white paper towel or cloth. Rinse the area. Spray lukewarm water on the stain and blot with a dry, white paper towel or cloth. Repeat. Continue steps 1-4 until the stain has disappeared.",
