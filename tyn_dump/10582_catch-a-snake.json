                    "description": "You can catch a snake using a long slender object like a badminton or tennis racket, or a long broom handle attached to a mosquito net. When you see the snake, you'll want to get quickly to the scene. Place your net in front the snake's head and coax the snake into the net. The long slender object you attach to the net should be long enough to keep your body a safe distance from the snake, while attempting to net it. Once the snake enters the net, lift up the net immediately to prevent the snake from getting out. Make sure your net is large enough for the snake you're aiming to catch. The net in front of the snake's head is effective because the snake will interpret it as a place of safety and willingly enter it. Approach the snake carefully and quietly. If you run over to the snake loudly you will provoke it to move away quickly, or worse, bite."

Use an old shirt or bath towel, and a pillow case. Toss the rumpled up tee shirt or towel over the snakes head and upper body. The snake will generally be afraid and coil up under the cloth. Without delay, place the pillowcase down over the shirt. Slide the edge firmly along the floor, scooping up the shirt and snake together. This can be done with a lingerie bag if it is large enough and you are not squeamish and know the snake is not venomous. Even if the snake is inside or outside coiled up, you can toss a heavy large towel over it and immediately grab it and place it in an empty box large enough to carry it in. Remove the towel. Close the box quickly and wait for it to settle down before opening it again. Make sure the bottom of the box is well sealed with tape and have someone hold the box closed until you can release it at least 5 miles from your home. If you need to transport the snake in the box yourself, make sure it is well sealed and can't get out inside the car or trunk. Make sure the location is away from other homes and in a good wild life environment where it can make a new home."
