Then, you reward the dog with a treat. Your pet will learn to associate that behavior with rewards. Pressing the clicker when the dog performs a behavior is much more effective than saying \"Good dog.\" This is because a clicker has a distinctive and unchanging sound and the dog hears the sound at the exact moment a behavior occurs."
