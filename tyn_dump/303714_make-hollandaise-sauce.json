    "text": " Three Egg Yolk Hollandaise Sauce Cut the butter into small chunks with a sharp knife.  Whisk the egg yolks with the tablespoon of water in a heavy-based saucepan.  Put the saucepan over a double boiler base that is simmering over low heat.  Add the chunks of butter gradually, without ceasing to stir, until the sauce is well mixed.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Pour in the lemon juice whilst still adding the remaining butter chunks.  Remove the sauce from the heat once the sauce has a smooth and creamy consistency.  Serve. Hollandaise sauce goes well with poached fish, eggs and steamed vegetables. Five Egg Yolk Hollandaise Sauce Pour 4 tablespoons of water in the saucepan. Add the salt and freshly ground pepper. Put the saucepan base into the bain marie (double boiler). The bain marie should already contain hot water but not boiling at any time. Melt the butter in a separate saucepan. Do not let it get hot, just melt gently. Crack the eggs and separate the yolks into a bowl. You can use the whites for something else. Beat the egg yolks to combine, then add 1 tablespoon of water. Transfer the egg yolks to the saucepan with warmed water and seasonings. Whisk the ingredients as they sit in the saucepan within the bain marie. Continue to whisk until the egg yolks take on the consistency of thickened cream. Pour the melted butter in slowly, whisking constantly. Add 2 tablespoons of water gradually in drops, once the butter has been completely added. Taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed. Once happy with the flavor, add the lemon juice and stir through quickly. Transfer to a serving container, as desired. If needed, the sauce can be strained. Serve warm. Two Egg Yolk Hollandaise sauce Set up the double boiler or bain marie. Add water and gently simmer. Add the egg yolks to the top portion of the double boiler. Also add the water and 1 teaspoon only of the lemon juice. Whisk the egg yolks and other ingredients together. Whisk until they begin to slightly thicken. Add around a teaspoon of butter at a time to the egg mixture. Whisk well after each addition. As you do so, the Hollandaise sauce will start to thicken and turn smooth. Pour in the remaining lemon juice. Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving container, as desired. Serve warm. Piquant Blender Hollandaise Sauce Place the butter into a small heavy-based saucepan. Melt over gentle heat but do not overheat or boil. Pour the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt and cayenne into the blender.  Blend together at a medium to medium-high speed. When it lightens in color, it's done (about 20 to 30 seconds). Switch to the lowest setting on the blender. Gradually tip in the butter, leaving the blender turning at its lowest speed. Allow it to blend a little longer after all the butter has been added. Turn off the blender. Do a taste test. You can adjust the lemon or salt flavors as needed. If it's too thick, add a little water but not too much. If you add anything, do a very quick blend to combine the additional ingredients. Transfer to a serving container or keep warm until needed. Serve warm.",
