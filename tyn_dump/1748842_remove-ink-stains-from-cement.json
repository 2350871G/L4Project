    "text": " Sodium Percarbonate Method Combine 2 tablespoons of sodium perborate and 1 cup of very hot water in a large bowl to make a sodium perborate hot bleach solution.  Add whiting to the solution until the mixture forms into a thick paste. Whiting can be bought in some paint stores. If whiting is not available, you can use kitchen flour. Thoroughly wet the surface to be treated with clean, clear water. Saturate the affected area with water. Apply the paste to the stained area in a \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) thick layer using a wood or plastic spatula. Make sure you spread the poultice evenly on the stained area. Let it sit until it's dry. Brush or scrape off the dried poultice using a wooden scraper.  Pour scouring powder on the affected area.  Use a stiff bristle brush to scrub the surface.  Thoroughly clean and rinse the area with clean water to remove any residual staining.  Dry the area with clean towels. Repeat the treatment if the ink stain is still visible on your cement. Ammonia Water Method Mix 1 tablespoonful of ammonia with 1 cup of water in a large bowl to make ammonia water.  Thoroughly wet the surface to be treated with clean, clear water. Saturate the affected area with water. Saturate a piece of cotton batting in the ammonia water.  Apply the cotton batting to the stained area. Let it sit until it's dry. Pour scouring powder on the affected area.  Use a stiff bristle brush to scrub the surface.  Thoroughly clean and rinse the area with clean water to remove any residual staining.  Dry the area with clean towels. Repeat the treatment if the ink stain is still visible on your concrete. Javelle Water Method Put 1 pound of washing soda in an agate pan.  Add 1 quart of boiling water to the washing soda.  Mix 1 1/2 pound of chloride of lime with 2 quarts of cold water in another container.  Let the lime-water mixture settle. Pour the clear liquid into the soda and water mixture to make Javelle water. Store this solution in colored bottles; light affects its strength. Pour 1 cup of Javelle water into a large bowl.  Add whiting to the Javelle water until the mixture forms into a thick paste. Whiting can be bought in some paint stores. If whiting is not available, you can use kitchen flour.
