Heat your pan till you feel warmth coming off of the pan when you hold your hand about 4 inches above it. Choose a non-stick skillet or cast iron skillet. These can prevent the salmon skin from sticking to the pan."

If you bought a long fillet of salmon, carefully use a sharp knife to cut the salmon into individual fillets. For this recipe, you'll need two fillets that weigh about 6 ounces each. Remove any pin bones from the salmon fillets before you cook them. To remove the bones, feel the sides of the fillets for any sharp or prickly bones sticking out. Use needle-nosed pliers to pull the thin bones out of the fillets."

Try to drizzle the oil evenly so both fillets are lightly covered with the oil. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt over the fillets and grind a few twists of black pepper over them. The oil will help the flesh of the salmon brown as it cooks and prevent sticking."

If you don't want much additional flavoring (beyond the salt and pepper), but want extra color in your salmon fillets, sprinkle paprika over them. This will help make a reddish-brown color as they cook. For unique seasonings, try:\nA dry barbecue rub\nChinese 5-spice\nGaram Masala\nRas el Hanout"

You should leave the salmon on while cooking since it's easier to remove after it's cooked and it can help prevent overcooking the salmon.

To keep the fillet flat as it cooks, press down evenly using a fish spatula. A fish spatula is a narrow metal spatula that gets wider at the end. It's flexible but strong enough to lift up a delicate fillet in one piece."

If your fillets are pretty thick on one end and taper to thin on the other end, consider pan frying the large wide sides for 1 1/2 minutes each and 30 seconds on each narrow small side. It's a good idea to use a timer to cook your fillets. Thermometers can be inaccurate since the shape and size of the fillets varies and cooks at different speeds.

This gives the fish a chance to finish cooking and the juices will redistribute within the fillets. Serve the salmon while it's still warm. You can cook the salmon ahead of time and refrigerate it. Use this in recipes that call for cooked, flaked salmon. Be aware that the skin will lose its crispness, so you should probably remove it before serving it."
