Scrub with a dilute, mild detergent from the top down to remove mildew, stains, and dirt. Rinse thoroughly from the top down, then let dry completely. Heavily discolored bricks may require chemical brick cleaners, but these can damage the brick or mortar, or interfere with the stain. Look for gentle options, and avoid unbuffered muriatic acid in particular. If you are treating a large surface, hire a trained operator to pressure wash the surface. Unskilled pressure washing can permanently scar bricks. Make sure you mix a cleaner into the water before pressure washing."
