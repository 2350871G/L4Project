This warning is set off when you ride too fast backward or you push the Segway beyond its limits, such as going over rough terrain, down a slope, or speeding up or slowing down too rapidly. Slow down. If it doesn't stop after slowing down, stop and get off as it could be telling you that your battery packs are low or that there are maintenance issues with the Segway. Indoors, keep to a slow walking pace, stay in the center of corridors as much as possible, give way to every person, and don't take the Segway where it's not permitted. Outdoors, aim to keep to a fast walking pace, again giving way to pedestrians and being very careful when going around corners."

Avoid holes, curbs, and steps when using the Segway. A Segway can easily trip up on such obstacles. Don't take your Segway down a steep slope. Doing so will cause it to unbalance, and it's very likely that you'll be thrown out. Don't ride a Segway on any surface that is slippery, such as ice (including black ice, be aware! ), snow, wet grass, oily or greasy areas, or wet floors. Don't ride over loose items such as branches, pebbles, rocks, broken glass, etc. These can cause the Segway to lose traction and tip you out."
