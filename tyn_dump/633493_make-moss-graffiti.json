Look to fences, pavement, damp brick walls, and cement walkways to harvest your moss. If you choose to buy moss, opt for the species called entodon or baby tooth because they grow best on concrete and other vertical surfaces. Moss from the woods doesn't work as well and should be left in the wild. You can buy moss from nurseries or online sources who grow it commercially. Avoid hypnum, moss, peat moss, and dried moss because these varieties either can\u2019t be made into a paint or won\u2019t grow well on vertical surfaces. If you don\u2019t see moss growing anywhere in your area, the moss paint probably won't work in your climate."
