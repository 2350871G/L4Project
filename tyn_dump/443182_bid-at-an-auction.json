This bidding number is usually written on a card that the bidder can hold into the air, signifying to the auctioneer of the intent to bid. The registration is on-site. If you do not register and receive a bidder number you will not be allowed to bid. While allowing a bit of privacy for bidders, it enables being recognized as a bidder by the auctioneer.

If the auctioneer misses you, repeat your action until he or she sees you. The fall of the hammer constitutes the sale. A bidder can withdraw a bid prior to the fall of the hammer but not after; after, a contract of sale has been formed. If the hammer falls and you made a bid but the auctioneer did not see you, dispute the sale and ask for the bidding to be reopened. The auctioneer does not have to comply but if others saw you bidding and back you up, you might succeed. This is why it is important to be clear about bidding."
