    "text": " Making Mini Tamale Pies Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Make sure that the baking rack is positioned in the center of the oven. Mix together the masa, baking powder, salt and cumin. Pour 2 cups (250 grams) of ground masa into a large bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of ground cumin. Stir everything together until evenly combined. Pour in the beef stock. Stir it in using a spoon. Keep stirring until it is evenly mixed in and the dough is crumbly. Add in the vegetable shortening. Melt the vegetable shortening first, then pour it in. Stir everything together with a spoon until combined, then knead the dough with your hands until everything is smooth. Scoop the masa dough into a greased mini muffin tin. Spray a mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Fill each well with 2 teaspoons of the masa mixture. Make an indent in each well using a pestle or teaspoon. You want the masa dough to coat the bottom and sides of the muffin tin's wells, sort of like a mini pie crust. If you have any dough left over, fill a second mini muffin tin, or set it aside to make a second batch. Set the mini muffin tin aside. You are now ready to prepare the filling. Saut\u00e9 the chopped onion and garlic over medium-high heat for 2 to 4 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat first. Once it gets hot, add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of butter, the onions, and the garlic. Saut\u00e9 for 2 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the meat, masa, tomato paste, herbs, and peppers. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Make sure that the meat you are using is already cooked. You can use beef, chicken, or pork. Note that you are only using 1 or 2 canned peppers and not 1 to 2 cans. That would be way too much! Add 1 cup of water and cook for 10 minutes. Pour the water into the skillet. Let the water come to a boil. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat to low. Allow the mixture to simmer until all liquid is gone. This will take about 10 minutes. Stir in the sour cream and lime juice. Make sure that the sour cream is completely mixed in, and there are no streaks or swirls. Add some salt and pepper to your taste. Fill the masa shells with the meat filling. Use a tablespoon to ladle the filling into the shells. Make sure that each filling gets the same amount. Bake the mini tamale pies for 20 minutes. Once they are done baking, take the mini muffin tin out of the oven and set it down on a wire cooling rack. Allow the mini tamale pies to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Pop the tamales out of the mini muffin tin, then garnish them. Use a butter knife or a spoon to pop the tamale bites out of the muffin tin. Arrange them on a serving platter. Sprinkle them with crumbled queso fresco cheese and some thyme. Making Mini Tamales Soak the cornhusks. Arrange the cornhusks in a pan. Cover them with hot water. Let the cornhusks sit in the water until they are soft and pliable. This will take about 1 hour. Remove the husks, drain them, then pat them dry. Set the corn husks aside on a paper towel so that they can continue to dry. Beat the butter until it is light and fluffy. Cut the butter into cube and put it into an electric mixer or food processor. Beat the butter until it is light and fluffy. Add the dry ingredients. Measure out 2 cups (250 grams) of masa (corn flour), 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and \u00bd teaspoon of salt. Add them into the bowl and stir them in with a rubber spatula. Mix in the chicken broth, then set the dough aside. Stir everything together one last time until evenly combined. At the very end, you may have to use your hand to knead the dough. Set the dough aside when you are done. Stir together the filling ingredients in a separate bowl. Put the shredded chicken, cubed Pepper Jack cheese, and enchilada sauce into a mixing bowl. Add the thinly sliced green onions. Stir everything together with a rubber spatula. Add 2 tablespoons of the masa filling into the center of each corn husk. Arrange your corn husks on a flat surface. Scoop two tablespoons of the masa filling onto each corn husk. Flatten the masa filling. Use your fingers or a spoon to flatten the masa filling slightly. You should have a 1\u00bd-inch (3.81-centimeter) border of corn husk all around the filling. Spread 1 tablespoon of the chicken filling down the center. Use a spoon to help nudge the chicken filling into place. Wrap the corn husk like a candy bar. Fold one of the long edges of the corn husk over the masa filling. Roll the husk around the masa and meat filling until you reach the other end. Tie the ends off like a candy bar. Position the ties to either side of the filling. This will keep the filling inside dry and prevent it from turning soggy. You can use thin strips of soaked corn husk  or baker's twine. Assemble your steamer. Fill your pot with 1\u00bd inches (3.81 centimeters) of water. Insert a steamer basket. Add the tamales. Arrange them in a single layer laying down. If you are using a smaller pot, stand them up vertically. Be careful not to pack them too tightly, or they won't cook right. Cook the tamales for about 30 minutes. Bring the water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pot with a lid, and allow the tamales to cook.
