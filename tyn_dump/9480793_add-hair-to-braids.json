        "Flip the latch over the hair caught on the hook first.",
        "Pull the hook back through the cornrow until you have about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the looped Marley hair sticking out from under it.",
        "Remove the latch hook and pull the tails through the loop.",
        "Flip the latch hook open and slide it off of the looped Marley hair.",
        "Gather the 2 loose ends of the Marley hair, and feed them through the looped end.",
        "Do not pull on the ends of the Marley hair to tighten the loop just yet, however.",
        "Twist the loop and pull the tails through it.",
        "Slip your fingers through the loop, so that the tails are under them.",
        "Twist the loop, then remove your fingers.",
        "Feed the tails through the twisted loop.",
        "Do this step twice for good measure.",
        "Pull on the tails to tighten the loop.",
        "Tug on the tails first to tighten the loop.",
        "Next, pull the 2 tails apart and away from each other to further tighten the knot.",
        "Let go of the tails and allow them to drape against your hair.",
        "You have just added your first strand of Marley hair to your cornrow!",
        "Repeat the process until you have filled every cornrow.",
        "Work your way back-to-front (or front-to-back if you prefer).",
        "Fill up the entire cornrow with strands of Marley hair before moving onto the next cornrow.",
        "When you are done, your entire head should be covered with Marley hair.",
        "The cornrows should not be visible.",
        "Plan on leaving about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space between the strands in the back of your head, and even less space in the front.",
        "Use thicker strands in the back, and thinner strands in the front.",
        "This will help your hair look fuller while still staying natural in appearance.",
        "Go over your head with your fingers when you are done, then fill in any areas that feel too thin.",
        "Trim, moisturize, and brush the Marley hair.",
        "Look in the mirror and take note of any strands that appear too long.",
        "Trim them with scissors until they are the same length as the other strands.",
        "Next, work in small sections to brush the hair out and apply a moisturizing hair cream to it.",
        "Brush the hair like you would your own hair: gently and starting from the ends.",
        "Applying product is optional and not always necessary.",
        "You want the hair to be moisturized, but not so much that it looks shiny or becomes matted because you used too much product.",
        "Curl the strands using bantu knots and hot water.",
        "Marley strands are made from synthetic hair, so using a curling iron will damage them.",
        "Instead, wrap and twist the strands into loose bantu knots.",
        "Dip the knots individually into a cup of boiling water.",
        "Let the hair dry completely before unraveling it.",
        "You can try curling the strands using a no-heat method, such as foam rollers, but they may still end up frizzy.",
        "Refill the cup with hot water periodically.",
        "If the water cools down too much, it won't curl the hair.",
        "Blow dry the strands straight if you want a sleeker the look.",
        "Clip the upper layers of your hair out of the way, then pull it straight and run the nozzle of a hairdryer along the top and underside of the strand.",
        "Hold the nozzle as close as possible to the hair.",
        "Work your way around your hair in layers, working in thin strands.",
        "Depending on the quality of your Marley hair, the highest setting on your hair dryer should be safe.",
        "If you need to, hold the nozzle further away from the strands.",
        "The sections you are working in should be just a little narrower than the width of your hairdryer's nozzle.",
        "Remove the extensions after your cornrows start to loosen.",
        "This will take about 2 to 8 weeks, depending on how fast your hair grows.",
        "Once your cornrows feel loose, cut the Marley hair as close as possible to your cornrows.",
        "Undo the braids, and comb out the rest of the Marley hair."
