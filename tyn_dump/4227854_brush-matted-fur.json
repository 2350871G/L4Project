Typically, the earlier you can catch a mat, the easier it will be to detangle. That\u2019s why you should examine your pet\u2019s coat daily, especially if the animal has long hair that\u2019s prone to tangling.

Folds of skin can even become trapped in the mat, which can lead to a severe laceration if you try to cut it away. You should also call a professional groomer if the mat is somewhere very sensitive, like on the abdomen, under the neck, or around the genitals, or if the animal is scared or aggressive. Cats in particular can be very skittish when you're working around their abdomen, even if they're normally very tame. A scared cat might curl around your hand, kicking with its back feet and gripping you with its front claws as it tries to bite you. A professional will know how to avoid these dangerous situations."

However, if you wash the animal before you detangle its fur, the mats will tighten up as they dry, which will make them even harder to remove. In addition, the mats might prevent the soapy water from penetrating the fur all the way to the skin, making the bath ineffective. If you're detangling dog hair, you may want to bathe the dog after you detangle its fur. However, avoid bathing a cat unless its fur is greasy or smelly. They typically groom themselves, and you'll just stress it out. If the mat is in a horse\u2019s mane,  you can use a special horse shampoo to wash its mane after you finish detangling it."

Separate loose hairs from the mats and gently work out any knots you can, but don\u2019t pull or tear at the animal\u2019s fur. Detangling mats can be a long process, and it can be stressful on the animal, especially if you\u2019re yanking with a comb the whole time. Using your fingers can help soothe the animal, and will decrease the amount of time you spend pulling on the mat. Try petting the animal as you detangle its fur to help calm it down. For instance, if you're detangling a mat on a cat's side, reach up every so often and stroke the cat's cheeks or chin. That way, it will associate the grooming with positive attention."

A brush is not as effective at removing mats, because it won\u2019t penetrate the fur as deeply. Grip the mat securely with one hand, as close to the skin as you can get. Then, try to pick apart the mat with the widest end of your comb, using short, gentle strokes. Start at the end of the mat furthest from the animal\u2019s skin and work your way inward. Do not yank on the mat, as this is likely to upset the animal. Also, avoid raking the comb directly across the animal\u2019s skin, as this could cause irritation over time. This part of the process takes time and patience. Work in small sections, and if the animal starts getting frustrated, take a break. If it creates a negative association with the grooming process, you\u2019ll have a harder time keeping the mats from coming back. If you're detangling the fur on a treat-motivated animal like a dog, cat, or horse, offer it treats and plenty of soft, soothing praise if it's acting calm and relaxed."

If a mat is too tangled to comb out, soak it with a detangler and let it soak in for about 30 minutes. Then, come back and try to break the mat apart with your fingers or comb it apart. Because animals have different skin pHs, you should never use products intended for another animal. For example, you shouldn't use a conditioner for a horse's mane on a dog. However, you may find some detanglers that are intended for both cats and dogs. If that's the case, it should clearly say so on the label. Also, never use human skin or hair care products on an animal.Tip: If you\u2019d prefer a natural remedy, dust the mat with cornstarch or baby powder, or apply coconut oil to the mat and let it soak in."

This will help you catch any smaller tangles that might be left behind. If your comb is only one width, use a smaller, fine-tooth metal comb, or go over the area with the animal\u2019s normal brush.

Press your hand against the animal's skin to help reduce pulling. Then, work the teeth of the razor comb under the mat and gently pull down in the direction the hair grows. Don\u2019t yank; just allow the tool to gently slice through the matted fur as far as it will go. It may take several passes to cut through the hair holding the mat in place. Doing this will remove smaller mats, but it may also help loosen the tension on larger mats, helping the animal be more comfortable as you continue. You can find these tools at most pet supply stores. Choose a size that's best for your animal. For instance, you would want a smaller razor comb for cats and small dogs, and a larger tool for larger dogs. This tool is very sharp, so always use caution when you\u2019re using it. Also, be sure to always have the sharp ends pointing upward, away from the animal\u2019s skin. Similarly, don't apply too much pressure on the tool, as it's easy to accidentally rake the skin and cause injury. Take special care around angled areas like the legs and tail. Warning: Never use scissors to cut away mats. It\u2019s very easy to cut the animal if it moves suddenly."

Then, turn on the clippers and lightly run them over the very surface of the mat, moving in the direction that the fur is growing.

However, don\u2019t clip all the way to the animal\u2019s skin\u2014just stop once you\u2019ve removed the bulk of the mat. Before you try to use clippers, make sure the animal is stable and calm, and have someone else hold it still, if you can. Speak to the animal in a soothing voice to reassure it throughout the process, and stop if it gets agitated. If you're grooming a cat, it may help to have someone gently hold it by the scruff of its neck. This can actually help calm a cat, since it's the way mother cats carry kittens when they're young. If the animal is so matted that it needs to be completely shaved, take it to a professional groomer. If your cat typically experiences a lot of stress during grooming, it may be best to take your cat to the vet, who can sedate your cat and remove all of the mats. Not only will this make your cat more comfortable and stress-free, it will also prevent your cat from becoming more fearful of grooming in the future."

        "Run your fingers over the animal\u2019s fur, breaking up as many mats and tangles as you can by hand.",
        "Separate loose hairs from the mats and gently work out any knots you can, but don\u2019t pull or tear at the animal\u2019s fur.",
        "Detangling mats can be a long process, and it can be stressful on the animal, especially if you\u2019re yanking with a comb the whole time.",
        "Using your fingers can help soothe the animal, and will decrease the amount of time you spend pulling on the mat.",
        "Try petting the animal as you detangle its fur to help calm it down.",
        "For instance, if you're detangling a mat on a cat's side, reach up every so often and stroke the cat's cheeks or chin.",
        "That way, it will associate the grooming with positive attention.",
        "Break apart larger mats with a comb, working from the outside in.",
        "If you come across a mat that you can\u2019t detangle by hand, you\u2019ll likely need to break it up with a wide-toothed metal comb.",
        "A brush is not as effective at removing mats, because it won\u2019t penetrate the fur as deeply.",
        "Grip the mat securely with one hand, as close to the skin as you can get.",
        "Then, try to pick apart the mat with the widest end of your comb, using short, gentle strokes.",
        "Start at the end of the mat furthest from the animal\u2019s skin and work your way inward.",
        "Do not yank on the mat, as this is likely to upset the animal.",
        "Also, avoid raking the comb directly across the animal\u2019s skin, as this could cause irritation over time.",
        "This part of the process takes time and patience.",
        "Work in small sections, and if the animal starts getting frustrated, take a break.",
        "If it creates a negative association with the grooming process, you\u2019ll have a harder time keeping the mats from coming back.",
        "If you're detangling the fur on a treat-motivated animal like a dog, cat, or horse, offer it treats and plenty of soft, soothing praise if it's acting calm and relaxed.",
        "Saturate a stubborn mat with a detangling product for that specific animal.",
        "Deep conditioning products contain oils that can help the animal\u2019s fur slip out of the mat.",
        "If a mat is too tangled to comb out, soak it with a detangler and let it soak in for about 30 minutes.",
        "Then, come back and try to break the mat apart with your fingers or comb it apart.",
        "Because animals have different skin pHs, you should never use products intended for another animal.",
        "For example, you shouldn't use a conditioner for a horse's mane on a dog.",
        "However, you may find some detanglers that are intended for both cats and dogs.",
        "If that's the case, it should clearly say so on the label.",
        "Also, never use human skin or hair care products on an animal.Tip: If you\u2019d prefer a natural remedy, dust the mat with cornstarch or baby powder, or apply coconut oil to the mat and let it soak in.",
        "Go back over the area with a fine comb or brush once you remove the mat.",
        "Many combs for animal grooming have a wider side and a fine-tooth side.",
        "If that\u2019s the case, comb back through the animal\u2019s fur with the finer side once you\u2019ve gotten most of the mat free.",
        "This will help you catch any smaller tangles that might be left behind.",
        "If your comb is only one width, use a smaller, fine-tooth metal comb, or go over the area with the animal\u2019s normal brush.",
        "For example, you might use a small slicker brush on a long-haired cat or a bristle brush for a dog with a medium coat.",
        "Cutting out Mats Safely Use a razor comb to try to cut out the mat first.",
        "A razor comb, which may also be called a rake tool or a mat splitting tool, looks like a wide comb with long, sharp teeth.",
        "Press your hand against the animal's skin to help reduce pulling.",
        "Then, work the teeth of the razor comb under the mat and gently pull down in the direction the hair grows.",
        "Don\u2019t yank; just allow the tool to gently slice through the matted fur as far as it will go.",
        "It may take several passes to cut through the hair holding the mat in place.",
        "Doing this will remove smaller mats, but it may also help loosen the tension on larger mats, helping the animal be more comfortable as you continue.",
        "You can find these tools at most pet supply stores.",
        "Choose a size that's best for your animal.",
        "For instance, you would want a smaller razor comb for cats and small dogs, and a larger tool for larger dogs.",
        "This tool is very sharp, so always use caution when you\u2019re using it.",
        "Also, be sure to always have the sharp ends pointing upward, away from the animal\u2019s skin.",
        "Similarly, don't apply too much pressure on the tool, as it's easy to accidentally rake the skin and cause injury.",
        "Take special care around angled areas like the legs and tail.",
        "Warning: Never use scissors to cut away mats.",
        "It\u2019s very easy to cut the animal if it moves suddenly.",
        "Cut out large, stubborn mats with hair clippers.",
        "Use your hand to pull the animal's skin as flat and tight as you can around the mat.",
        "Then, turn on the clippers and lightly run them over the very surface of the mat, moving in the direction that the fur is growing.",
        "If you need to, you can make several passes, gently running the clippers over the surface of the mat each time.",
        "However, don\u2019t clip all the way to the animal\u2019s skin\u2014just stop once you\u2019ve removed the bulk of the mat.",
        "Before you try to use clippers, make sure the animal is stable and calm, and have someone else hold it still, if you can.",
        "Speak to the animal in a soothing voice to reassure it throughout the process, and stop if it gets agitated.",
        "If you're grooming a cat, it may help to have someone gently hold it by the scruff of its neck.",
        "This can actually help calm a cat, since it's the way mother cats carry kittens when they're young.",
        "If the animal is so matted that it needs to be completely shaved, take it to a professional groomer.",
        "If your cat typically experiences a lot of stress during grooming, it may be best to take your cat to the vet, who can sedate your cat and remove all of the mats.",
        "Not only will this make your cat more comfortable and stress-free, it will also prevent your cat from becoming more fearful of grooming in the future.",
        "Check the clippers every minute or so to make sure they aren\u2019t too hot.",
        "Clippers can get really hot, which can burn the animal if you\u2019re not careful.",
        "About every 60 seconds, turn off the clippers and lightly touch your hand to the blade.",
        "If it\u2019s uncomfortably hot to the touch, it\u2019s too hot for the animal.",
        "Wait a few minutes for the clippers to cool down before you turn them on again.",
        "You can also use a cooling spray designed for clippers to help keep the blade from overheating.",
        "Try to detangle the fur with a comb once you\u2019ve removed most of the mat.",
        "Often, removing the outer surface of a mat will help loosen it enough that you can finish the detangling process with your fingers or a wide-tooth comb.",
        "If you still can\u2019t loosen the mat, clip away a little more fur, or call a professional if you\u2019re concerned you need to clip too close to the skin.",
        "A detangling spray may also be useful after you\u2019ve removed the bulk of the mat.",
        "Saturate the animal\u2019s fur with the spray and let it sit for about 30 minutes, or the amount of time recommended on the product label.",
        "Then, gently comb the animal\u2019s fur to loosen any remaining tangles."
