If you're writing down a recipe you've made so many times you could cook it in the dark, take a step back and think about the best way to present it to other people. Who will your readers be, and what is their cooking style? Your intended audience should influence the way you write your recipe. If you're writing down a family recipe to make sure it's never forgotten, authenticity will be important to you and your readers. You'll need exact ingredients and measurements so that people in future generations will be able to recreate Grandma's biscuits or Uncle Benny's chili and taste a piece of family history. If your recipe will have a public readership, tradition is less important than taste and accessibility. Make sure your readers will be able to find the ingredients you list, and ensure the final outcome will be tasty enough to make it worthwhile for your readers. Consider the skill level of your readers, too. Decide if there are ways you can make the recipe easier to follow for beginner cooks. If there's no getting around complicated cooking techniques, write the steps out as clearly as possible."

        "Even if you don't include step-by-step photos, you may want to have at least one picture of the finished dish.",
        "Listing the Ingredients Provide exact measurements and volumes.",
        "For each ingredient, write exactly how much you used.",
        "List all the measurements in a consistent format - either imperial or metric (or both, if you'd like).",
        "Use consistent abbreviations for measurements.",
        "For example, tsp.",
        "or tbs for teaspoon or tablespoon.",
        "If an ingredient doesn't have a numerical measurement, capitalize it.",
        "For example, Olive oil.",
        "List the ingredients in the order you use them.",
        "It's standard to list ingredients in order of use so that it's easy for the reader to keep track of which ingredients have been used.",
        "List ingredients used together in order of volume.",
        "For example, if you're writing a recipe on baking a cake, all the dry ingredients will probably be sifted together at once.",
        "Since you can't list them in order of usage, list them in order of volume: 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and so on.",
        "Write \"divided\" after ingredients to be used in several parts.",
        "In many cases, you may need to use one ingredient in several different steps in the recipe.",
        "For example, you may cream butter with sugar to make a coffee cake batter, then use butter again later to make a crumb topping.",
        "For instances like these, list the total amount of butter followed by the word \"divided\" - as in, 6 tablespoons butter, divided.",
        "Break the list into more than one part, if necessary.",
        "If the recipe has two or more separate components, like pie crust and pie filling, divide the ingredient list into two or more sections.",
        "Title each section appropriately.",
        "Write For the filling, For the crust, and so on.",
        "List generic items instead of name brands.",
        "Unless a specific product is absolutely necessary to make your recipe turn out correctly, try to list generic, raw ingredients instead of name brand products.",
        "For example, instead of writing 2 cups Angelsoft flour write 2 cups cake flour.",
        "Include simple techniques in the ingredient list.",
        "In order to make the method section of your recipe less wordy, you can include simple techniques like chopping, mincing, and melting as part of the ingredient list.",
        "List the ingredient measurement first, followed by the technique.",
        "Here are a few examples:\n1 cup butter, melted\n2 tablespoons shallots, minced\n1 1/2 cups bell pepper, finely chopped\n2 apples, peeled and sliced Writing the Method Describe the equipment needed.",
        "Equipment can make or break a recipe, so be very specific about the size, shape, and composition of the supplies needed to cook a dish.",
        "For example, write Use a 9-inch pie pan or In a large cast iron skillet or frying pan, to direct your readers as carefully as possible.",
        "Let readers know if one type of equipment can be substituted for another.",
        "For example, a blender might do in the absence of a food processor.",
        "You may want to include a list of special equipment needed - a double boiler, kitchen twine, a baking stone, and so on.",
        "Write clear, easy-to-read descriptions of the process.",
        "Break it down into simple steps and describe each technique using common cooking or baking terminology.",
        "Long, complicated steps should be separated into their own paragraphs to make the method easier to follow.",
        "Don't use too many adjectives or provide too much information - just the minimum needed for the recipe to turn out right.",
        "Here are a few examples:\nMelt the butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.",
        "Add the shallots and onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute longer.",
        "Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.",
        "Beat in the eggs one at a time.",
        "In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.",
        "Write exact temperatures and cooking times.",
        "If the recipe calls for the use of an oven, be sure to write exactly what temperature to preheat it to.",
        "For stovetop cooking instructions, use common terms like \"medium-high\" and \"medium-low\" to indicate how hot the pan should be.",
        "Temperatures can also be described through techniques.",
        "For example, write simmer on medium-low to indicate that the soup shouldn't be at a rolling boil.",
        "Indicate how long the food should cook.",
        "Write Bake for 20 - 25 minutes or Cover and let simmer for 1 1/2 hours.",
        "Add hints to help the cook stay on track.",
        "Since everyone's oven and stove are a little different, it's helpful to add hints about how the food should look, feel and smell at various steps.",
        "Here are a few examples:\nBake until the cheese is bubbly, about 15 minutes.",
        "Bake until the top is brown and crisp.",
        "Simmer until the flavors have melded.",
        "Cook until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.",
        "Cook until the quiche filling is just set.",
        "Cook until the salmon's flesh is opaque and firm.",
        "Separate complicated steps into paragraphs.",
        "Recipes with multiple complicated techniques need a method section that is broken down into separate paragraphs.",
        "Each paragraph should encompass a complete part of the recipe.",
        "In a pie recipe, for example, separate the method for making the crust from the method for making the filling.",
        "Describe how to finish the dish.",
        "The last part of the method should indicate how to complete the dish, whether that means letting it cool for 10 minutes before slicing or garnishing with chopped cilantro.",
        "Describe how the final dish should look and taste so your readers will know what to expect.",
        "Making Final Touches Title the recipe.",
        "A descriptive title will help attract people to your recipe and set it apart from the thousands of variations out there.",
        "There's no need to get too descriptive - your recipe will speak for itself once it's cooked!",
        "Just come up with a title that sounds appetizing and appealing, with a personal twist if you're so inclined.",
        "A few examples:\nTricia's Cocoa Brownies\nSweet and Sour Chicken Soup\nCrunchy Salty Oatmeal Cookies\nUncle Pete's Famous Clam Chowder Consider writing a short introduction.",
        "If your recipe has a special history, consider including a short introduction so readers will know how much heart and soul has gone into its creation.",
        "Write about who first cooked the recipe, tweaks that have been made over the years, or anecdotes about times people in your family have enjoyed it.",
        "Provide helpful information.",
        "Add any extra information that readers should know when they're cooking the recipe.",
        "Here are a few things you might want to include:\nList how many servings the recipe provides.",
        "Write how long the recipe takes to make, including prep and cooking time.",
        "Include serving suggestions, such as optional garnishes or other dishes that pair well with the recipe (e.g.",
        "\"Top with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream\" or \"Serve with slices of crusty baguette.\"",
        "Include ingredient substitutions to account for dietary restrictions (e.g.",
        "\"Cashews may be substituted for walnuts\" or \"Use tofu instead of chicken to make the dish vegetarian\").",
        "Give sufficient warnings about any problems which may occur during the cooking.",
        "An example of this might be Do not open the oven door while baking, or your cake may fall, or Do not let the oil get too hot on the stove.",
        "Make the recipe clear and easy to read.",
        "When you're writing your recipe, compose it in a way that makes it easy to read.",
        "If you wish, sprinkle photos throughout to make instructions even easier to follow.",
        "The standard information order in recipes is as follows:\nTitle\nIntroduction (optional)\nIngredient list\nMethod\nNumber of servings\nCooking/prep time Test your recipe.",
        "Once your recipe is complete, cook it again to test it.",
        "You might also want to share it with someone else who has never made it before.",
        "See if the recipe as you wrote it turns out \"just right.\"",
        "If it is too sour, sweet, salty, spicy, or otherwise fails the taste test, consider what you might do to correct the problem, then begin the process over again.",
        "Guessing an adjustment, either in ingredients, cooking times, or temperatures does not always yield success.",
        "This is the reason \"Test kitchens\" are operated like laboratories, and results are carefully documented and repeated."
