Hold the scraper against the surface at a 45-degree angle and apply pressure as you scrape away the burnt material. Remove the debris as you go. Take care to keep the razor blade flat and angled down, and avoid using the two sharp corners of the blade, as they could damage your cooktop. You can find a razor blade scraper at any hardware store. Always be extra careful when using razor blades, as they are incredibly sharp.

Heather\u2019s business The Tidy Maiden and Heather\u2019s book The Automatic Bosslady were recently featured on CBS. Heather Isenberg\t\t\tHome Cleaning Expert & Entrepreneur\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Once you've cleaned the glass surface with a cleaner like a cream designed for glass stovetops, use a razor blade to remove any leftover food. Hold the razor blade at an angle to protect the glass and scrape any remaining food from the surface. Spray the cooktop surface with water and wipe down with a clean cloth. Once you\u2019ve removed all of the stubborn debris from your cooktop, spray down the surface with a light dusting of warm water, and give it one final wipe to clean off the cooktop cleaner and remove any leftover debris. At this point your glass cooktop should look so shiny you might even be able to see your reflection peering back at you. Cleaning an Electric Coil Cooktop Heat the electric coils on high for 3 minutes to burn off residue. The electric coils of your electric cooktop can get dirty fast. Luckily, they are super easy to clean. Start by powering all of your burners to high. Heating the coils on high for 3 minutes will help burn off grease and food stains. If the coils are especially dirty, you\u2019ll want to open up a window and turn on your kitchen fan, so you don\u2019t smoke out your kitchen. Wait for your burners to completely cool, then slide them off the cooktop. You\u2019ll want to make sure that the coils have cooled completely before continuing, so take a break (20 minutes or more) and let them cool to the touch. Once they\u2019ve cooled, they should easily slide off the cooktop surface. Give them a gentle tug to lift them from the electric connection point (where they are attached to the stove). If they don\u2019t slide right off, consult your stove\u2019s manual to find out how to remove them. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have the manual on hand; you should be able to find it easily online by searching for the stove model. Wipe the coils with a soapy cloth or sponge. Set up a workspace on your kitchen counter to clean off the coils. You don\u2019t want to submerge the coils in water, because you could damage the electric connection point. Instead, use a damp cloth (or sponge) and a bit of dish soap to wipe off leftover grease and residue. Scrub the front and back of the coil, taking extra time to work through grease and buildup. Work carefully around the electric connection point to avoid damaging it. Cover the coils in a paste made of baking soda and water; let sit for 20 minutes. If the coils still have residue that didn\u2019t come off with a simple wipe down, try mixing baking soda with enough water to form a paste (try roughly 2:1 baking soda to water). Use your fingers to spread the paste over the coils, as though coating them in frosting. Letting them sit in the paste for 20 minutes will allow the baking soda to break down stains, grease, and food. Scrub the coils and wipe completely with a damp cloth. After the baking soda paste has done its magic, use the abrasive side of a sponge to scrub the paste deeper into the coils. You don\u2019t have to press too hard, but scrub hard enough to remove the remaining residue. Then, take a damp cloth to wipe off all the baking soda. Set the coils to the side while you continue cleaning the other parts of your electric cooktop. Remove the drip pans and scrub with a sponge and warm soapy water. Your electric cooktop likely has drip pans resting beneath the coils. Most of the food residue on your stove will have fallen into the drip pans, so taking the time to clean them out will take care a lot of the mess. Start by wiping out loose crumbs, then use a sponge covered in warm soapy water to scrub the drip pans until they look clean. If the soapy water isn\u2019t doing the trick, try mixing 1 part white vinegar, 2 parts baking soda and a few drops of dish soap to make a cleaning paste. Spread this cleaning mixture over the drip pans and let them sit in your sink for 10 to 15 minutes. Scrub the mixture with a sponge to completely remove the residue, then rinse them completely. Set the cleaned drip pans aside to dry while you continue working on the surface of your cooktop. Lift the top off your electric stove just like you would lift a car hood. Most electric stoves have an underside where spills and crumbs tend to hide. Because this area is hidden, it can develop bad smells and hard-to-remove stains. Lift the surface of the stove until the underside is exposed in order to evaluate the mess. Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the underside of the cooktop. Once you have access to the underside of the stove, you will be able to evaluate how much cleaning is required. Start by wiping the area with a damp cloth or sponge to get rid of crumbs and obvious messes. Dust the area with baking soda and spray with vinegar to break up residue. If the underside of your stove was properly cleaned with a simple wipe down, you can skip this step. Otherwise, take a handful of baking soda and dust it over the entire surface. Then, spray white vinegar over the baking soda (or take a few capfuls of vinegar and carefully drizzle it over the baking soda). Adding vinegar will make the baking soda fizz like crazy. Let this mixture sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Vinegar will activate the baking soda and help break down residue that your sponge couldn\u2019t get through. Scrub the baking soda mixture, then wipe with a damp cloth and dry it completely. After 10 minutes have passed, use your sponge to scrub the baking soda and vinegar mixture into the surface. Scrub dirty areas more aggressively. Then, wipe down the entire surface with a damp cloth until the underside of your stove looks and smells nice and clean. Dry the surface with a dry cloth or paper towel and close the stovetop. Wipe your cooktop surface with a damp cloth to remove crumbs. Start this final part of the cleaning process by wiping down the top of your stove to remove crumbs. Use a damp cloth or a sponge to scoop all the crumbs into a pile and discard them. Work carefully around the electric connection point in the center of each burner. Scrub the surface with a soapy sponge to clean off grease. Use the abrasive side of your soapy sponge to scrub all the remaining residue off the surface of your cooktop. Work through stubborn messes with the vinegar and baking soda mixture. Sprinkle the messy areas with baking soda and spray with vinegar. Let sit this fizzy mixture sit for a few minutes. Then, scrub the area with your sponge and use a damp cloth to wipe the mixture completely. Wipe down the surface of your cooktop with a damp towel. Once your cooktop is free of stains and residue, wipe down the entire surface with a damp towel. Make sure to remove any leftover baking soda, soap, and residue. Place the drip pans, followed by the electric coils, back onto the cooktop. Once the top of your cooktop looks completely clean, it is time to add all the components back to the stove. First, place in the clean drip pans. Then, gently return the coils by placing them gently back onto the electric connector. Enjoy your clean stove and celebrate by ordering some takeout. Cleaning a Gas Cooktop Remove the cooktop grates and place into a sink filled with soapy water. Gas burners have easily removable metal grates that sit right on top of the flame. They should lift right off, so take them off and place them into your sink. Let them soak in warm soapy water while you continue cleaning the stove. The longer they soak, the easier they will be to clean later. Don\u2019t forget to use a stopper to make sure your sink stays filled with water. Remove burner covers and knobs and place them in a bowl of soapy water. The burner covers are the disk-like plates that sit where the gas flame comes out of your stove. These should just lift right off. Place them into a bowl filled with warm soapy water. They tend to be coated in grease, especially if you haven\u2019t cleaned your stove in a while, so it is best to let them sit in the water for at least 10 minutes. If you can, remove the knobs that control your gas flame. Add them to the soapy water and let them sit while you continue cleaning your stove. Some cooktops have different sized burners. If this is the case, try to remember which burner cover corresponds to each burner. In general, the power burner will be a large plate, while the simmer burner is a small plate. Wipe down the surface of your cooktop with a damp cloth. Now that you\u2019ve removed the metal plates and the cooktop is exposed, you will have access to all the crumbs and spills that have fallen through the grates. It can be surprising how many crumbs accumulate beneath the grate. Use a damp cloth to scoop and discard any crumbs. Soak a sponge in a bowl filled with warm, soapy water. Fill a large bowl with warm water and add a squirt of dish soap. Soak a sponge in the bowl of water to get it nice and soapy. Choose a sponge that has a soft side and an abrasive side. The abrasive side will be helpful when scrubbing off messes, and the soft side will help you wipe off material you\u2019ve removed. Use the sponge to clean the cooktop surface by scrubbing dirty areas. Use the abrasive side of your soapy sponge to apply pressure to grimy spills. Scrub down stubborn areas more aggressively, then wipe the sponge over the cooktop to remove the material you\u2019ve dislodged. You will probably have to do this repeatedly, alternating between scrubbing messes and wiping off the cooktop to remove whatever has come off. Throw away all the material that is removed. If you feel like you need to use something a bit stronger than your sponge, try using a scouring pad. You may want to test this on a corner of your cooktop surface before using it over the entire cooktop. Some cooktop surfaces are more delicate than others, and scouring pads can leave scratch marks. Test out a little corner that sits under one of the metal grates. If it didn\u2019t scratch the surface, you are good to go. Add baking soda and a capful of hydrogen peroxide to clean grease. Hard to scrub messes can be dealt with by mixing baking soda and hydrogen peroxide. Cover the messy spots with a handful of baking soda. Then, drizzle a capful of hydrogen peroxide on top of the baking soda. It will get really fizzy as the combination breaks up buildup, helping to remove caked-on spills. Try gently scrubbing this mixture in with your sponge, then wipe it off and remove any material that was released. Spray glass cleaner on the control board and wipe it with a towel. Glass cleaner will help cut through grease buildup and splatter that has accumulated on the control board of your cooktop. Spray a light dusting of glass cleaner over the control board, then wipe it down with a damp towel or paper towel. If it still looks messy at this point, spray another round of glass cleaner and wipe it down again. Spray the cooktop surface with clean water and wipe it dry. When your cooktop looks completely clean, spray the surface with a dusting of warm water and wipe it dry with a microfiber cloth or paper towel. Take extra time to make sure you\u2019ve removed all the soap and cleaner you have applied so that it doesn\u2019t heat up and smell when you start cooking again. Scrub the cooktop grates with an abrasive sponge, then rinse them. Now that your grates have been soaking in warm water for at least 10 minutes, it is time to give them a thorough scrubbing. The abrasive side of your sponge will help remove spills that have caked onto the grates. Rinse them with warm water to remove excess soap. Metal grates are generally quite durable, so you can be aggressive as you scrub them free of dirt and grime. Scrub the burner covers and knobs until they are clean, then rinse them. Use the abrasive side of your sponge to scrub the burner covers until they are completely clean. Try using the soft side of your sponge when you clean the knobs. Once the covers and knobs are cleaned, rinse them with warm water until you have removed all the soap. Lay the cooktop grates, burner covers, and knobs on a towel to dry. In order to keep your newly cleaned cooktop in great shape, make sure that the grates, burner covers, and knobs have completely dried before you put them back on. Dry them off with a towel, or lay them on a towel on your kitchen counter until they are fully dry. Place the grates, burner covers, and knobs back onto the cooktop. Now that your cooktop looks sparkly and clean, it is time to place the burner covers back onto their corresponding burner. Then, add the metal grates back on top of the burners, and push the knobs back on. Your stovetop will look shiny and new. Burner covers generally fit right onto the burner, but you may have to wiggle them a bit for them to fall into place.",
