It can be time consuming, but you won't spend as much time coiling later on. You can skip doubling the rope and still follow these steps, but in the end you will have only one strap and will need to improvise when securing it to your body."

Grab the long end with the opposite hand (without letting go of the rope you're already holding). Measure out your arm's length and put that length behind your neck, never letting go of the rope you grabbed. Repeat this process, alternating hands because every time you coil the rope, you'll be bringing the long end to the opposite side. You'll find more and more rope accumulating in each hand, which could make this task difficult if you have small hands and a long length of thick rope."
