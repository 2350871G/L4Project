Mark where you want to apply the border. Remember to take into account the width of the border. Wallpaper borders are usually about 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 cm), but you should check the specific measurements on your roll. Mark the desired height with a pencil. Use a ruler and a level to make sure your line is straight and even. Try to avoid outlets and light switches. Fill in holes in the section where the border goes with  spackle.

The extra inches will help you when you need to trim and overhang the paper later. Cut using a razor blade and a ruler to make sure your cut is straight. Soak prepasted paper according to the instructions. Usually, this involves soaking the border in lukewarm water for 2-3 minutes. When you remove it from the water, pull it out slowly to let the water drip off. You can also use a clear paste activator instead of water. Spread the border pattern-side down on a table if it\u2019s unpasted. Apply the kind of adhesive specified on the directions.
