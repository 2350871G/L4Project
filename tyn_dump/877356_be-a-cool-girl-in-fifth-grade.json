            "headline": "Wear creative clothes.",
            "description": "Be the trend setter. Wear casual clothes that look cute, including brand-name clothes. Buy clothes from stores that are considered popular in your school, wear stylish items, but stay on dress code if your school has one. Make sure you wear matching clothes and don't try mixing crazy colors. If you think the colors match, go ahead! Make all your outfits cute and comfy. Your day will be better if your clothes are comfortable. If you cannot afford to buy a bunch of new clothes before school starts, getting a couple of new T-shirts or accessories can bring life back into older clothes. Plus it can give them a whole new look."

            "description": "Play sports, take up a hobby, or join a club you like. This will get you involved in things outside of school and at home. You have to care about school, but you also have to allow yourself to have some fun, participating in extracurricular or hobbies, too. Do a sport that involves your interests, like swimming, gymnastics or soccer."

Shower with gel soap or just any ordinary bar soap (showers at school are good too!) Try brushing your teeth twice a day. Nobody likes yellow teeth or bad breath. Use quality deodorant, if necessary. Always carry a tissue in your pocket, or somewhere nearby. You definitely do not want to be in a situation where you have a runny nose and don't have anything to stop it except your fingers."

When you get to the milk accounts you slip on a wet floor, and pizza gets all over your shirt. Do not ever get up, throw away the pizza, and rush to the bathroom. Just laugh about it. It will make all embarrassing things go away. Always look like your life is perfect just the way it is. Don't laugh too much, however, or people will think you are weird."

Tattling just shows you are a little baby who tells on people! Cool girls do not tattle. If there really is a situation where you need to tell an adult that something is wrong, do so. There is a difference between tattling and doing the right thing by reporting something. Don't try to downgrade other people, or you will appear mean."

            "description": "Always be a great hostess. Popcorn, movies, Truth or Dare, and dancing are some of the things you can do, have, or watch at a sleep over. Don't throw too many parties, and don't send out invites if only two people can make it. It'll make you look socially inept. Try finding a great game you can play, and be the center of attention! Not a desperate center, but a cool relaxed center."

Be too serious, and people will think you're boring and nobody will come to anything you host. Come from somewhere in the middle."

            "description": "Have a cool phone case and make sure to have a passcode so nobody can see your personal stuff, like text messages. Have a variety of cool music, including whoever is most popular at your school (also have more than one singer). Have a lot of songs! Add everyone you know and have cool apps that people use (Instagram, Minecraft, etc.). Also have an app where you can send people stuff (like online cards or something). In addition have a cute, sophisticated up-to-date picture of yourself. Do not reveal too much or try to look older than you are in these photos, as there are creeps online who search for that. You can be cool without attention-seeking through makeup or revealing clothes. Also, only add friends. Don't make your password obvious like your name, last name, or best friend's name. If someone sends you a mean email, IM, or text, just brush it off. Even if it bothers you, tell them that you don't care and block them from contacting you online."

If you're mad at that person, even though you had a good dis, have a party. That'll cheer you up and if you're really feeling up to it, have sleepovers and cool activities once every week. If your feeling down, don\u2019t let it break your day. Brush it off and keep moving."
