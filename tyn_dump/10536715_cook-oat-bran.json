    "text": " Cooking Oat Bran on the Stovetop Bring 2 cups (470 ml) of water to a boil. Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of water into a pot and add a pinch of salt. Place the pot on your stovetop and turn the heat to high. Wait 5-10 minutes for the water to start boiling. If you want a creamier oat bran, you can use milk or soy milk instead of water. Wait for the liquid to come to a boil before adding the oat bran. Add 1 cup (94 g) of oat bran to the pot. Measure out 1 cup (94 g), of oat bran in a measuring cup.

Place the skillet on the stovetop and turn the heat to medium-low. Use a wooden spoon to stir the coconut for a few minutes until it turns golden brown. Set the coconut to the side for later after you\u2019re done browning it. Heat 14  fl oz (410 ml) of coconut milk and 1.5 cups (350 ml) of water. Pour the coconut milk and the water into a pot and place it on your stovetop. Stir the liquids together so they are well incorporated.
