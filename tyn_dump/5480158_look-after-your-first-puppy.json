            "description": "Puppies are naturally curious animals, who like to chew up everything and always want to have a full stomach. Make sure to meet the requirements for a puppy-proof home. Clean up any chemicals, and then put them in a cupboard. To puppies, chemicals like antifreeze can smell like candy, and they will lap it up eagerly, so make sure everything is put away properly. Pick up any objects littering the floor. This includes kids' toys, tissues, slippers, clothing, pencils, etc. Until your puppy learns not to pick stuff up off of the floor, you don't want to risk having to take your puppy in for surgery to remove the object. Close the doors to other rooms. Having to clean and puppy-proof the entire house can be a daunting task, so limit the dog to only a few rooms at first (it's easier on the dog, too - an entire house can be intimidating). For example, the kitchen and the living room for the puppy, and then let the puppy go into other times throughout the time that passes."

            "description": "Be sure to pick the one that fits your puppy's needs. Consider getting dry kibble. Make sure it isn't tested on animals except for taste testing, and make sure it doesn't have any ingredients such as poultry or meat by-product, which contain things that are unhealthy for your dog. Also, make sure that you get dog food intended for your dog's age - puppy, adult, or senior. Be sure to have good water as well. Either from the sink, tap, or bottled water, it will be okay for your puppy. However, rainwater isn't recommended even if it's filtered."
