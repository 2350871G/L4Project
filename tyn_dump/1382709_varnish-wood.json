Oil-based varnishes, including some polyurethane varnishes, are very durable. They usually have to be mixed with a paint thinner, such as turpentine. They also have strong fumes and must be used in a well-ventilated area. The brushes you use must also be cleaned well in order to preserve them and make them last longer. Acrylic and water-based vanishes have low-odor and can be mixed with just water. They tend to dry quicker than oil-based varnishes, but they are not as durable as oil-based varnishes. The brushes you use can be cleaned with just soap and water. Spray on varnishes are easy to use. They do not require brushes and they do not need to be thinned. They must be used in a well-ventilated area, however, as they have strong fumes, which might make you feel lightheaded or nauseous. Varnishes are also available in both clear and tinted forms. Clear varnishes will allow the wood's natural color to show through while colored varnishes can act as a stain and tint the piece a specific color."
