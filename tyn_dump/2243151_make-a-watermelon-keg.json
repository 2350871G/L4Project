A hole approximately two to three inches (5 to 7.5cm) from the base of the watermelon is appropriate.

You will want to fit the spigot snugly into the hole created by the corer, but not so large that a gap is created. If the spigot line has a sharp edge and the watermelon skin is not overly tough, try puncturing the skin using the spigot and bypass using the apple corer. You may find that you get a tighter fit this way."
