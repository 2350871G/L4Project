For example, if you want to make the waist 2 inches (5.1 cm) narrower, pin 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the fabric from the center seam.

Tip: If you take in a lot of fabric, this will cause the back of the pants to pucker. To fix this, stitch the excess fabric from the waist down to the crotch. Sew in a curve that matches the original curve of the pants. Turn the pants right side out before you're ready to wear them."

For example, if you need a small adjustment, you might only need to remove 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric. For a larger alteration, you could remove 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Remove the belt loop from the back of the pants. Take off the pants and use a seam ripper to pull out all of the stitches that are securing the back belt loop to the waist of the pants. Then, remove the loop and set it aside. Keep the back loop so you can reattach it to the pants after you've adjusted the waist. Seam rip along the back of the waist near the middle. Use the seam ripper to remove the stitches from the middle of the waist on the back of the pants. Remember to start in the center and remove an equal length of stitches along both sides of the waist.

You can fold the pant leg as you sew or fold it all first and pin it in place. If you use pins, ensure that you don't accidentally sew over them or you could damage your sewing machine. Repeat this for the other pant leg. Iron the new hemline. Fold the pair of pants in half so the legs are stacked on top of each other. The seams for each pant leg should be stacked in the center. Then, move the pants to an ironing board and press the hemline with a hot iron. This will remove wrinkles and the markings you made with the tailor's chalk. Use high heat with steam for cotton fabric, such as jeans or scrubs. If you're altering rayon or polyester, use medium heat. Altering the Crotch on a Pattern Try on a muslin mock-up of the pant legs. Instead of wasting high-quality fabric on pants that need a lot of alteration, make a muslin mock-up of the pants. Sew it according to the pattern and put it on. Then, wrap an elastic band around the waist to hold it up. The mock-up will show you exactly how the fabric will fit in the crotch area. You'll be able to see if it's hanging too low or puckering in spots. Take in the crotch if there's excess fabric along the seam. If the crotch is hanging too low, use your fingers to pinch the excess fabric. While you're pinching the fabric, insert sewing pins to make the crotch shorter. Walk around a little and try to sit in the mock-up pants. Adjust the pins until the crotch feels comfortable. Keep in mind that you'll probably only need to make a small adjustment, no more than about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Add an extra strip of fabric if the crotch needs to be longer. You might notice that the crotch is too tight or difficult to move in, which means it's too short. To fix this, use scissors to cut the front seam that runs from the waist down to the bottom of your crotch. Then, slide a piece of muslin into the slit you just made. This will give you more fabric to work with and you can now pin the adjusted crotch where it feels comfortable. It doesn't matter size what the fabric piece is as long as you can easily expand the crotch and pin it in place. Remove the mock-up pants and measure the new crotch. Lay the mock-up pants on a flat work surface and fold them in half so the crotch line that you pinned is on 1 end. The legs should be stacked on top of each other. Now take a ruler and measure the distance from the pins that you inserted to the fold of the fabric. This measurement will show you how much you need to take in or extend the crotch. Cut the lengthen/shorten line to leave an \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) hinge. You should see this horizontal line on your pattern. It moves from the outer hip side to the crotch. Cut along the line starting at the crotch and stopping when you're about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) from the other end. Move the hinged pattern piece to lengthen or shorten the crotch. If you need to make the crotch longer, open the hinge you just cut by the measurement you took. Then, tape pattern paper underneath it to fill in the gap. To shorten the crotch, adjust the hinge until the top and bottom pattern pieces are overlapping by the amount you measured. For example, your hinged pattern piece might overlap by \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) or there may be a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) gap that you've filled with pattern paper. Sew another mock-up with the new crotch measurement. Lay your adjusted pattern on muslin and cut out the pieces. Sew the muslin mock-up and try it on again so you can see if the crotch now fits the way you want. If you're happy with how it fits, you can use the adjusted pattern pieces to cut out the actual fabric you'll use for the pants. Don't be afraid to make more adjustments to the crotch. You might find that you need another alteration in order to get the perfect fit.",
