Place all shoes and chewable items out of reach, install locks on cabinets containing harmful household chemicals, and bundle up and remove any exposed cords which could look like tempting chew toys. Also, ask that everyone in the house keep closet and outer doors closed when your new dog arrives so that it can\u2019t get into any mischief or accidentally escape your home. You might know to keep bags of dog kibble tucked into locked cabinets or bins, but don\u2019t forget that dogs\u2014and especially puppies\u2014are attracted to people foods as well! Don\u2019t leave half-eaten bags of chips or candy out, and make sure that all kitchen items are stored out of reach from your canine companion.

First of all, it will present them with a warm, safe \u201cden\u201d which they can retreat to when feeling tired, overwhelmed, or anxious. Secondly, it will help you to potty-train a breed known for being somewhat difficult when it comes to housebreaking. Make the crate an appealing place before your puppy\u2019s arrival by installing a comfortable bed, chew toys, and a few treats inside. You should select a well-ventilated crate big enough to allow your dog to stand up, turn around, and lay down when it reaches full adult size. For an average Shih Tzu, expect an adult height of eight to eleven inches to the shoulder and weight of 9-16 pounds. Never leave a puppy younger than six months old in the crate for more than three to four hours at a time, and don\u2019t ever use the crate as punishment. If you do, the puppy will associate the crate with negative emotions and will no longer perceive it as a restful, secure space."

        "Most plans such as that offered by the ASPCA will cover illness and injury, but you can purchase additional coverage which can address genetic disorders, routine health care, or behavioral problems.",
        "Start potty-training immediately.",
        "Shih Tzus can be difficult to housebreak, so you should start teaching proper potty procedures as soon as you bring your puppy into your home.",
        "Do this by covering specific areas in a newspaper or disposable \u201cpiddle-pads\u201d and praising the puppy when it pees or poops in these prescribed areas.",
        "Stay close when you go outside in order to praise the puppy when it does its business outdoors.",
        "When it\u2019s time for bed or you need to leave the puppy unsupervised for a short amount of time, put the puppy in its crate.",
        "If your crate is too large, you\u2019ll have a harder time crate training and housebreaking your puppy.",
        "A puppy is unlikely to soil its sleeping area, but, if it can get up and walk away from the bed, it won\u2019t be so particular about making a mistake.",
        "Stay active with plenty of play time.",
        "Shih Tzus don\u2019t need much outdoor exercise a day, as they\u2019re small enough to get most of their daily exercise quota running around the house and furniture.",
        "That being said, you should play fetch, tug-of-war, and other fun games with your puppy in order to keep them engaged and healthy.",
        "You should also take your puppy on at least one brief walk per day.",
        "This lets your puppy sniff around and see the exciting world outside of your apartment or home, as well as get them used to diverse sounds and smells to which they wouldn\u2019t normally be exposed.",
        "Train and socialize by the twelve-week mark.",
        "Shih Tzus can be stubborn and slow learners if you wait too long to start training and socializing them, so get them into doggy kindergarten classes by ten- to twelve-weeks old.",
        "Take them to dog parks as soon as they can walk comfortably on the leash so that they'll tolerate other canine and human company without displaying troublesome behaviors like barking, jumping, and nipping.",
        "Make sure you do this only after your puppy has received all the necessary vaccinations in order to avoid catching any bugs from other dogs.",
        "Feeding and Grooming Your Puppy Pick a premium brand of dog food.",
        "Once your puppy has become acclimated to its new home, you should select a premium brand of dog kibble with multiple sources of protein for its daily diet.",
        "Look for good ingredients like fresh chicken, duck, egg, pea flour, oats, and rice, and avoid problematic ones like cereals, propylene glycol, corn, and animal fat.",
        "Due to their household status as a family member and lapdog, Shih Tzus are particularly prone to fussy eating habits.",
        "If you give your puppy even a little bit of food from the table, it will quickly become accustomed to people food and reject its kibble.",
        "You can avoid these bad habits by never giving your puppy scraps and discouraging begging behaviors.",
        "Feed your puppy three times a day.",
        "Even if your puppy doesn\u2019t seem to overeat or have a developing weight problem, you should feed at prescribed times during the day rather than leaving the food bowl down.",
        "This will help to establish a healthy routine as well as prevent fussy eating habits.",
        "You can\u2014and should!\u2014give your puppy treats in order to reward good behavior, but make sure these treats are small.",
        "This way they won\u2019t interfere with your puppy\u2019s meals and feeding schedule.",
        "Consider using individual kernels of your dog\u2019s ordinary kibble and your puppy will be less likely to develop problematic preferences.",
        "Brush your puppy daily and take it for professional grooming monthly.",
        "Brushing and cleaning a puppy will only take a few minutes, but it\u2019s important not to skip as it gets them accustomed to the sensations and routine of grooming.",
        "Use a mixed bristle and nylon brush to thoroughly comb through its coat and a small pair of scissors to trim long outgrowths or facial fur that impedes vision.",
        "If you keep up with this brushing regimen, you can wait for intervals of four to six weeks between trips to the professional groomer.",
        "Unless you\u2019re trying to raise a show dog, you\u2019ll probably want to give your dog what\u2019s called a puppy cut; that is, a short, all-over style that trims your dog\u2019s coat to one to two inches.",
        "You can choose to grow your Shih Tzu\u2019s coat long like show dogs, but be prepared for more demanding grooming commitments."
