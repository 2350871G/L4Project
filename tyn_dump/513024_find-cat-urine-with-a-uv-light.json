For example, if your male cat sprayed to mark his territory on the wall, it may look like a splatter, with a few drips running down the wall. If the cat peed on the floor, you might just see a large round-ish spot. Some cleaning products and other household materials, including wallpaper glue, may glow under a blacklight, so don't panic if your whole room lights up when you turn on the UV light. Other substances, including some bodily fluids and tonic water, may also glow. Use the location, size, shape, and smell of the spots to determine if it's cat urine."

Directions may vary, but typically these sprays don\u2019t need to be wiped away. You can find enzymatic cleaners at pet supply or home improvement stores, or you can even make your own if you want to. Be sure to read the directions on the product you\u2019re using to make sure it's safe for the surface you need to clean. You may also want to spray a little of the cleaner on an inconspicuous area to make sure it won\u2019t damage the finish of whatever you\u2019re cleaning. Enzyme cleaners are typically gentle compared to other cleaning products. You can find powdered enzyme cleaners if the item you're cleaning can't get wet. Tip: If you\u2019re cleaning a material like wood or leather, read the label to make sure you choose a product that\u2019s safe for those surfaces."
