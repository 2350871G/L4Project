                    "description": "Baking soda is a classic organic fungicidal ingredient. For it to be effective on plants, it needs an oil and a detergent to help it stick to leaves. Mix 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of vegetable oil and 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of dish soap into 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. Stir the ingredients so they are mixed, and transfer the solution into a clean, empty spray bottle. You can also use an oil-based soap, such as Murphy\u2019s oil soap, instead of separate oil and soap ingredients. Simply use 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of oil soap with 4 tablespoons (56 g) of baking soda in 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. Try substituting potassium bicarbonate for baking soda. Potassium bicarbonate can be less harsh and just as effective as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) on plants."
