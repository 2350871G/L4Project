Do not try to grab your phone, valuables, or your other important possessions. Your only concern is to get out of there as fast as possible. Nothing else is as important as this. You should be getting yourself and your family members out safely. If it's nighttime, yell loudly to get everyone up. You may only have less than a minute to escape safely, so ignore all secondary concerns that have nothing to do with staying alive.

If your door is open and there is a fire preventing you from exiting the room, close the door to protect yourself from the fire. If the door is hot or there's smoke under it and there are no other doors to pass through, you will have to try to escape through a window. Be careful!"

Though you may think that running is faster, encourage your family members to crouch or crawl, too. Smoke inhalation causes people to become disoriented and can even render a person unconscious. Knowing this, you should cover your nose and mouth if you have to walk by or through a heavily smoke-filled room. You can also place a shirt or a wet rag over your nose and mouth, but only if you have time. This will only buy you a minute or so, which is not a lot of time, but it does help to filter those products of combustion which lead to smoke inhalation."
