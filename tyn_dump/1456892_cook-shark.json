                    "description": "Set the shark meat in a refrigerator-safe dish and submerge it in milk. Allowing it to soak eliminates the smell of ammonia and gamey flavor that a lot of fresh catches have. If you buy the shark from a quality source, it may have already been treated. If you don\u2019t smell any ammonia, you may not need to soak the meat, although you can still do so to make sure the meat is at its best. Fresh-caught shark needs to be soaked right after it is cleaned, or else the meat can become inedible. It doesn\u2019t really matter what type of milk you use. Most people use any type of cow\u2019s milk or buttermilk, but alternatives like soy milk or even lemon juice do well in a pinch. Plain milk is less acidic than buttermilk and lemon juice, so it can be a good option if you aren't making a ceviche."

Most recipes don\u2019t call for shark skin, so you can remove it as well. If you\u2019re buying shark from a store, chances are someone took care of this ahead of time, so you don\u2019t need to worry about it. You can remove the skin after you cook the meat. Leaving the skin on may help the meat retain more moisture."

                    "description": "Slice the shark horizontally with a sharp knife to divide it up into smaller pieces. Avoid cutting the shark too thick or too thin. Shark meat is lean, so it can easily dry out when you cook it. Marinating the shark after you slice it can help prevent it from drying out. Although steaks are a common way to cook and eat shark, you can also chop the steaks up into smaller pieces, such as when making kebabs or a ceviche."

Then, use your knife to break the steaks down into smaller pieces. Make them into cubes about the same general size. The pieces don\u2019t have to be exactly the same size, but keep them small and thin so they cure properly. Toss the shark cubes with citrus juice and other seasonings. Add the shark pieces to a glass or ceramic casserole dish. For a basic ceviche, try using \u20442  c (120 mL) of both lime and lemon juice. Also add \u00bd a cup (75 g) of diced red onions and 1 cup (200 g) of chopped tomatoes. For seasonings, mix in 1 chopped serrano chili, 2 teaspoons (11.38 g) of salt, 1 teaspoon (1.0 g) of oregano, and 1 teaspoon (1.80 g) of cayenne pepper.
