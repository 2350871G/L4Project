These are available online or at large crafting stores. You will need an oil based clay to sculpt the mask. You will also need a form to sculpt your mask on top of such as a Styrofoam mannequin head. You will need a material called industrial gypsum in order to make a mold of the sculpture. You will need some burlap to make your mold 3-D. Select a good quality brand of liquid latex for your mask. You will need a casting latex specifically formulated for mask making, called RD-407. You can also purchase paints or decorations such as fake fur, sequins, or feathers to put on the mask. This will depend on what final look you are hoping to achieve."

In order to transfer the clay sculpture to a latex mask, you need a two-piece mold made out of industrial gypsum, which is porous so that the latex can soak into it as you make the mask in the next step.

After the first coat of plaster is set, mix a new batch, and apply the burlap and plaster mixture to strengthen the mold. After the plaster is set, remove the clay wall.

Use a butter knife, working very carefully along the visible seam made by the acrylic paint so you do not crack your mold. Once the two halves are separated, remove the clay and the Styrofoam head. Applying the Latex and Finishing the Mask Pour latex into the mold. Using a good amount of latex, pour it into the mold making sure to rotate the mold in your hands to get the liquid latex into all the recesses and work out air bubbles. A small brush may help you work the latex into deeper parts of your mold. Turn the mold right side up to allow the excess latex to drain from the mold.

The talcum will fall into place as you peel the mold from the plaster keeping it from sticking to itself. After you have removed your mask, trim away excess latex to clean up the edges.
