Pat the turkey breast with paper towels until it is dry. Cover the turkey breast with the seasoning rub. Use your hands or a pastry brush to spread it along the sides and top of the turkey. Warning: According to the USDA, you should not rinse the turkey breast before you season or cook it. Rinsing raw turkey can actually spread dangerous bacteria around your sink and work space. Most turkey breasts will come with the bones, but you can also cook a boneless turkey breast."
