While the glue is drying, you can work on making the covers. This will save you some time. Making the Covers Cut two 4 \u20442 in (11 cm) squares out of thin cardboard. This is large enough to make a set of covers for 4 in (10 cm) pages. If your pages were a different size, make the cardboard squares \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) larger instead. For example, if you made 6 in (15 cm) pages, then make the cardboard squares 6 \u20442 inches (17 cm). Use a metal straight-edge and a craft blade for the most precise finish.

Set the scrapbooking paper down so that the blank side is facing up. Coat the back of each cardboard piece with glue, then press it down onto the scrapbooking paper, making sure that it is centered. A glue stick will work the best for this. You can also apply a thin coat of white school glue with a brush. Clip the corners off of the paper to reduce bulk. Use scissors or a craft blade to slice the scrapbooking paper corners off until they are flush with the cardboard. This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help reduce bulk when you go to fold and glue the paper. Make sure that you do this for all 4 corners on each piece of cardboard. Secure the edges of the scrapbook paper to the front of the cardboard. Coat the edges of the scrapbook paper with more glue. Next, fold them over, then press them down onto the cardboard. Alternatively, you can secure the edges with strips of double-sided tape. Assembling the Scrapbook Glue the cardboard to the front and back of your accordion. Coat the first page of your accordion with glue, then press the first cover cardboard-side-down onto it. Flip the accordion over, and do the same thing with the other cover. Make sure that you are pressing the cardboard side into the glue. The scrapbook side should be visible. Let the glue dry before moving on. Decorate the covers, if desired.
