Before you start working, make sure the area has good airflow. Open up doors and windows and turn on a fan if necessary to increase air circulation. Areas such as attics and basements can often have poor circulation. Be sure to aim a fan and open up whatever doors or windows you can to improve the flow of air. Wear a facemask if necessary to avoid breathing in the fumes."

        "Don\u2019t overfill it or cover the textured section of the tray so you can run your paint roller over it to remove the excess.",
        "If you used your paint tray to prime your plywood floor, make sure you clean it well so the primer doesn\u2019t mix with your paint and alter its appearance.",
        "Use a 3 in (7.6 cm) paintbrush to paint the corners of the floor.",
        "Take a smaller paintbrush and dip it into the paint in the reservoir.",
        "Lightly brush it against the textured section so it won\u2019t drip and apply a thin coat of paint to the corners of the room, where the paint roller won\u2019t be able to reach.",
        "Use smooth, back-and-forth strokes to apply the paint evenly.",
        "Use the smaller paintbrush to apply paint to any section the roller can\u2019t reach.Tip: Be sure the apply only a thin layer with the small paintbrush so the finish is consistent over all of the plywood floor.",
        "Apply an even layer of paint to the floor with a 12 in (30 cm) paint roller.",

        "Start in a far corner and work in sections to apply an even layer of the paint to the plywood floor using smooth, broad strokes.",
        "Add additional paint to the roller as needed.",
        "Allow each coat to dry completely before you add additional layers.",
        "Check the paint can for specific drying times and make sure you allow the paint to dry completely so it forms a consistent layer.",
        "Apply as many layers of paint as you like, but make sure you allow the paint to dry completely after each application.",
        "Use at least 2 layers to completely cover the primer.",
        "Be sure to apply another thin layer in the corners with a smaller paintbrush before you roll on an additional layer over the rest of the floor.",
        "Let the paint cure for 3 days before you place furniture on the floor.",
        "Once you\u2019re finished painting the plywood floor, you\u2019ll be able to walk around on it after a few hours.",
        "But you need to wait a few days before you start moving in chairs, tables, and other furniture or it could peel up or damage the paint."
