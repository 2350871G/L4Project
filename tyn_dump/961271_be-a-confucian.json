However, different sects have varying numbers of commandments,  usually 5,6,7,8. Most Confucian teachings have these basic precepts or tenets (all Confucians must follow these precepts):\n\nLi - Ritual propriety and etiquette\n\nHsiao - Love within the family, love of parents and love of children\n\nYi - Righteousness\n\nXin - Honesty and trustworthiness\n\nJen or Ren - Benevolence, humaneness towards others (this is the highest Confucian virtue)\n\nChung - Loyalty to the state."

Xin is a major feature of the Chun-Tzu and the ruler should also have Xin, if he has Xin you must be loyal to him as part of Chung and Hsiao, though Confucius allows Citizens to overthrow rulers without Xin.
