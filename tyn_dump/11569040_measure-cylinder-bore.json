        "Insert the dial bore gauge into the first cylinder in the block.",
        "Arrange the instrument so that the head points straight across the cylinder from front to back (perpendicular with the cylinder block).",
        "Lower it into the opening until it\u2019s sitting about \u20442\u20131 inch (1.3\u20132.5 cm) below the rim.",
        "This will be the starting position for your first measurement.",
        "Double-check that the head of the instrument is more or less level before you begin measuring.",
        "The measurement you take with the head of the gauge running perpendicularly to the cylinder block will be known as the \u201cvertical\u201d measurement; the one you take with the head configured parallel with the block will be known as the \u201chorizontal\u201d measurement.",
        "Rock the gauge back and forth until the indicator needle reverses its direction.",
        "Just like when you calibrated the dial bore gauge to the micrometer, the position at which the needle begins to fluctuate will serve as your measuring point.",
        "This occurs when the head is perfectly level inside the cylinder.",
        "Hold the gauge still at this \u201csticking\u201d point and make a note of where the indicator needle falls on the dial.",
        "If your discover that the head you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t fit inside the cylinder, take it off and fit the instrument with the next smallest size in the kit.",
        "If the needle stops somewhere to the left of the \u201c0,\u201d the measurement is in the negative range, which means that the cylinder\u2019s bore is greater than its clearance specification.",
        "No cylinder should ever have a diameter smaller than its listed dimensions, which would cause the needle to fall to the right of the \"0.\"",
        "Translate and record the measurement you get in the first position.",
        "Each whole number on the dial represents 1 one-thousandth of an inch, while each of the tiny notches in between is 1 ten-thousandth of an inch.",
        "Write down this measurement on your chart as \u201cTop 1,\u201d \u201c1-A,\u201d or something similar.",
        "If the needle stops between the 7 and 8 positions on the dial, for example, it means that the inside of the cylinder is 2.5 thousandths of an inch larger than its clearance specification at your measuring point.",
        "Always convert your measurements into decimal form to maintain consistency between the values on your chart and those printed in the engine\u2019s service manual.",
        "Using the example above, you would record \u201c2.5 thousandths of an inch\u201d as \u201c0.0025.\u201d Turn the head of the gauge 90 degrees and measure a second time.",
        "Now that you\u2019ve found the diameter of cylinder on its vertical axis, repeat the process on the horizontal axis.",
        "Put this measurement down as \u201cTop 2,\u201d \u201c1-B,\u201d or similar, being sure to stick with the same format throughout the entire chart.",
        "Performing 2 separate measurements at each point will help account for areas with excessive wear and paint a more complete picture of the cylinder\u2019s dimensions all the way around.Tip: If you\u2019ve opted to measure 3 separate axes along each point of the cylinder\u2019s depth for maximum precision, start with your vertical measurement, then rotate the head of the gauge 45 degrees to both the left and right for your next 2 measurements.",
        "Reset the gauge vertically and lower it by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "Turn the instrument once again so that its head is running across the cylinder from front to back, then guide it down to its next point along the inside of the cylinder.",
        "Proceed to take your second pair of measurements, one vertical and one horizontal, exactly the same way you did the first set.",
        "Stop after each position to record the indicated dimension clearly.",
        "Don\u2019t attempt to memorize your measurements\u2014there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll have forgotten the previous number by the time you figure out the next one.",
        "Continue measuring and lowering the gauge in 1 in (2.5 cm) increments.",
        "Keep on in this fashion until you\u2019ve filled out all 8 measurement slots for the first cylinder in the block.",
        "When you\u2019ve found the overall bore of this cylinder, move your gauge over to the next one and repeat the process.",
        "Do this for each cylinder you want to measure.",
        "By the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll be able to visualize the many small variations in width along the inside of each cylinder, which will help you decide what needs to be done to it.",
        "Compare the measurements of each of your cylinders to the dimensions listed in the engine\u2019s service manual.",
        "If any part of a cylinder\u2019s internal surface exceeds the minimum or maximum amount of clearance recommended for the piston, you may need to have it rebored."
