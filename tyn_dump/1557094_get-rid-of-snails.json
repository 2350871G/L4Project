Bury the container in you garden or near the place where you saw the snails, but leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the soil. The smell of the beer will attract the snails, which will drown in the container. Adding yeast will make the traps more enticing to the snails. You may need to put out multiple traps, as they will only be effective for snails that are close by. Other great options for your beer container include a plastic cup, yogurt cup, bowl, or pie dish.
