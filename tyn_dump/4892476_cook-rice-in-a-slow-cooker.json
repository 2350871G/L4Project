Plan on using \u00bd-1 cup (95-190 g) extra for each additional person you\u2019re feeding. Remember, rice can as much as double in size as it cooks. This means that 1 cup (190 g) of uncooked rice will puff up into about 2-2.5 cups (380-475 g) of rice once cooked.Tip: You can use a slow cooker to fix any type of rice, including white, brown, wild, or long-grain jasmine or basmati."

Continue rinsing your rice until the water runs clean, then shake the sieve a few times to get rid of excess water. Alternatively, you can swish your rice in a shallow bowl full of water, draining and replacing the water when it becomes cloudy.

While any type of slow cooker will get the job done, a large, oblong variety that holds at least 6 quarts (5.7 L) will work provide the most even and consistent heating. One of the best things about using a slow cooker is that everything is done in a single piece of cookware, which means less prep work and faster cleanup!"
