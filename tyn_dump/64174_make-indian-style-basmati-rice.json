        "Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil.",
        "A splash of oil will give your basmati rice that sheen you see in restaurants.",
        "It won't change the flavor too much, unless you use a flavored oil.",
        "Vegetable oil is the most common, but you can use whatever type you like.",
        "Olive oil is a common substitute if vegetable oil isn't in your cupboard.",
        "Add the washed rice and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.",
        "Once the rice is in, reduce the heat to low.",
        "Stir only once, maybe twice while cooking.",
        "Opening up the pot may result in the rice hardening and losing its flavor.",
        "A large part of making rice is trusting it'll all work out.",
        "Make sure the heat is on low, not medium-low.",
        "If the stove is on any higher than that, you risk the rice burning.",
        "Turning it on higher will not reduce the amount of time needed; it will just fry your rice and boil out the flavor.",
        "Once cooked, let the rice sit for 5 or so minutes.",
        "Take the rice off the heat and let it sit, covered.",
        "This allows the grains to soften and steam.",
        "Any additional liquid will be soaked up, too.",
        "After this time is up, check the rice is cooked by squeezing a grain between your forefinger and thumb.",
        "The rice should break into pieces.",
        "Finished!",
        "Fluff with a fork and serve.",
        "If you've done it right, you'll see that each grain stands on its own and is a little longer than it was when raw.",
        "Now that's how you make rice!",
        "Restaurant-Style Stovetop Rice Soak the basmati rice for 20-30 minutes.",
        "You'd be surprised how much of a difference this seemingly insignificant step makes.",
        "Soaking the rice prior to cooking allows the grains to separate from each other and bloom.",
        "This makes a huge difference in taste and texture!",
        "Get as close to the 30-minute mark as possible.",
        "A little soaking is good, but a half an hour of soaking is better.",
        "The more you soak, the fluffier your rice will be.",
        "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat.",
        "Even though you're only heating 2 tablespoons of oil right now, this pot is where everything is going to go, rice and water included.",
        "Grab a pot that has a lid \u2013 you'll need it for covering later.",
        "Add in your seasonings.",
        "After oil has heated for a minute or so, it's time to add in your seasonings.",
        "They'll need to be cooked and stirred for another minute.",
        "In no particular order, add:\n1 cinnamon stick (about 2 inches long, preferably)\n2 pods of green cardamom (or 1 teaspoon if you don't have pods)\n2 whole gloves (or 1 teaspoon if ground)\n1 tablespoon of cumin seed Then add your sliced onion to the pot.",
        "After the seasonings have had a minute or so to cook and absorb some oil, add your sliced onion.",
        "Saut\u00e9 the onion and seasonings until the onion starts to turn a rich, golden brown.",
        "You'll see it turning colors and growing softer and softer.",
        "This will probably take around 10 minutes, depending on the heat radiating through the pot and the size of your onion.",
        "Drain the rice and add it to your pot.",
        "With a colander, drain your soaking rice.",
        "Try to get as much water out as possible.",
        "Then, throw it into your pot with the spices and the onion.",
        "Cook and stir the rice for 2-3 minutes; you want the outsides to be just lightly toasted.",
        "After that time is up, add in your teaspoon of salt.",
        "If you're on a low-salt diet, you may skip this part, though!",
        "Add 2 1/2 cups of water to the pot.",
        "Give the rice a stir to separate the grains and to fully immerse it in with the oil and seasonings.",
        "Give it a couple of minutes to come to a boil, and then immediately move onto the next step.",
        "Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer the rice for 15 minutes.",
        "Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover it with a lid.",
        "Make sure it's on low!",
        "Any higher and the water will evaporate too quickly and your rice will burn.",
        "Don't be tempted to keep checking on the rice in this 15 minute period.",
        "The more you uncover the pot, the more steam can escape, and the harder your rice will be.",
        "Just trust that 15 minutes is around the right time.",
        "Remove the rice from the stove and let it stand for 5 minutes.",
        "Check and see what your rice looks like \u2013 if it seems just a teeny bit moist, that's great.",
        "In these next 5 minutes, it will finish steaming and cooking (covered, of course).",
        "Fluff with a fork before serving.",
        "That is some tasty looking rice, eh?",
        "Fluff it with a fork to watch the grains come to life.",
        "Then remove the cinnamon stick, cardamom, and cloves (if you used the whole kinds, of course).",
        "All you have to do from here is enjoy!",
        "Keep the pot covered as much as possible to keep the heat in.",
        "The rice tastes best fresh and warm, though it will keep for a few days covered and in the refrigerator."
