There is not a set position your feet must be in to do the twist, but if your legs are too close together, the movements might seem too stiff. Similarly, if your legs are too far apart, you might be able to balance yourself better but ultimately have difficulty keeping the beat. Use the shoulder-width rule as a guideline but experiment with different stances until you find one that feels natural and comfortable."

The lower part of your arms should be held diagonally out and upward. Keep your wrists and hands loose. As you twist, your arms will follow the movement of your hips.

You should alternate from foot to foot, placing your weight over one foot as you twist to that side and over to the other foot as you twist back. The important thing to remember as you twist is to keep your body down. By shifting your weight from side to side, your body will usually have a natural tendency to stay low. This is further supported by keeping your legs gently bent at the knees. Staying low is important if you want to do the dance correctly, but it also helps you to maintain your balance more effectively."
