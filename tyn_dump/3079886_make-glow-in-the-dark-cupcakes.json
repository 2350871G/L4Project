Mix up your favorite cake or cupcake recipe, then spoon the batter into 12 cups lined with paper and bake them according to the recipe. Remove the cupcakes and let them cool. If you're not familiar with making cupcakes, a simple vanilla cupcake is a great place to start. You can even make cupcakes from cake mix or buy pre-baked cupcakes from the bakery section if baking from scratch isn't your thing! Avoid cupcakes with fillings, as these may not be sturdy enough to stay intact through the dipping process.

        "Instead of pouring in 1 cup (240 mL) of cold water, however, substitute chilled tonic water.",
        "The tonic water will react to the UV light, which is what causes the cupcakes to glow.",
        "Let the gelatin cool for 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.",
        "You want your gelatin to be cooled, but not to set up.",
        "Let the saucepan sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes.",
        "Every so often, shake the pan gently so the gelatin doesn't harden as it cools.",
        "If the gelatin sets up, you'll have to make a new batch, as it will be impossible to coat the cupcakes.",
        "Dipping and Serving the Cupcakes Remove the cupcakes from the freezer and dip the frosting in the gelatin.",
        "Once the gelatin is cool, take your cupcakes out of the freezer.",
        "Make sure the frosting is hard to the touch.",
        "If it is, hold the cupcake by the base, then dip the frosting into the lime gelatin mixture.",
        "If you're worried about the cupcakes getting warm while you're dipping them, just take them out of the freezer 2-3 at a time.",
        "It's fine if a little of the gelatin drips onto the bottom of the cupcake, but try not to saturate the cake or it might fall apart.",
        "Return the cupcakes to the freezer for 5 minutes, then repeat 3-5 times.",
        "After you finish dipping the cupcakes in the gelatin, return them to the freezer for about 5 minutes.",
        "This will allow the frosting time to harden again after getting wet.",
        "After about 5 minutes, take the cupcakes out of the freezer and dip them again.",
        "Keep repeating this until you've dipped each cupcake a total of 4-6 times.",
        "Stir the jello after each batch.",
        "If the gelatin starts to get too thick, you can dip each one 4 times.",
        "However, dipping them 6 times will produce a better glow.",
        "Keep the cupcakes in the fridge or freezer until you're ready to serve them.",
        "Keeping the cupcakes chilled will help them hold their shape until you're ready to show them off.",
        "If it will be a day or more before you serve the cupcakes, keep them in the freezer, then transfer them into the fridge about an hour before you're ready to put them under the black light.",
        "This will allow the cake to soften before you eat it.",
        "If you have any leftovers, you can keep them in the fridge for several days.",
        "Turn off the lights and place the cupcakes under a blacklight to serve them.",
        "In order to get the glowing effect, you'll need to turn off all of the lights.",
        "Arrange your cupcakes under or near your blacklight, then flip it on to see them glow!",
        "Your guests will be wowed by this simple science trick!",
        "The glowing effect will be more obvious at night."
