    "text": " Cutting Fabric Sew your fabric's seam before you cut. Fabrics can only be pinked after the seam has been sewn. Depending on the fabric, you might use one of several seaming methods. You can use a sewing machine or hand-stitch the seam yourself. Begin your cut along the edge of the seam. Don't take off too much of the fabric. Your fabric will fray least if it is as far from the seam itself as possible. While you can always cut off more if you're unsatisfied with the edge, you cannot put fabric back on after you've cut it. Cut the seam in a straight line. Pinked hems look neat and tidy when cut in a straight line. If you have trouble keeping your scissors steady, use a ruler to measure your cut as you go. Make your way carefully through the fabric's edge to avoid wavering lines. Metal rulers are ideal for cutting in a straight line because they are harder to bend. You don't need to cut in a rush. Pink your fabric at your own pace. Practice on a fabric swatch first. If this is your first time using pinking shears, buy extra fabric to experiment with before you make the actual cuts. Try cutting in straight lines and at different paces to find what works best with you. Choosing the Right Material Use pinking shears on fabrics only. Some specialized pinking shears are made for use on fabric as well as leather, paper, and other materials. In most cases, however, anything except fabric will dull your shears. To avoid having to sharpen your shears often, primarily cut fabric. Pick pinking shears for fabrics with solid colors.

Your finished piece will look much more professional. Striped fabric looks especially poor when cut by pinking shears. Try pinking shears on smooth fabrics. Crisp fabrics (like taffeta or chiffon) look clean when cut by pinking shears. This is because the ridge left over by the shears is less thick and because the shears don't have to cut through too many layers. Bulky fabrics are usually harder to cut in a straight line. Cut primarily woven fabrics with pinking shears. Woven fabrics are those made by weaving threads over and under each other (hence the name). Tightly woven fabrics fray less and are best for pinking. Non-stretchy woven fabrics work particularly well if you want the cleanest cut. Examples of woven fabrics include: chiffon, denim, flannel, taffeta, crepe, kashmir silk, and chintz. Cleaning Pinking Shears Sharpen your pinking shears periodically. Dull pinking shears will make frayed cuts. When your shears are dull, use a sharpening wheel or sandpaper to maintain your shears.
