    "text": " Tying Fabric around Bar Soap Protect homemade soap from germs and damage with shrink wrap. Wrap the soap in plastic shrink wrap material and use a heat gun to shrink the plastic around the bar of soap. If you\u2019re selling your homemade soap, customers might find it more hygienic and professional-looking if you cover the soap in shrink wrap before wrapping it in fabric. You don't have to do this if you're giving away homemade soaps as gifts. Cut a piece of fabric that is roughly 4 times the size of your soap. You can eyeball the dimensions, but it\u2019s best to measure the soap first and cut fabric that is 4 times larger than the soap's dimensions to ensure full coverage.

Pull it toward the soap and place the flat, folded edge on top of the soap. Pinch 1 of the unfolded fabric sides with your thumb and index finger. Grab 1 of the unfolded fabric sides in the middle and pinch it with your thumb and index finger. Pinching it creates a triangle shape close to the soap bar with a tail of extra fabric sticking out on the other side of your fingers.

Use your free hand to repeat the same thing you just did\u2014gather the unfolded edge together in the center so that there\u2019s a triangle of fabric near the box and a loose tail of fabric that extends beyond the triangle. Tie the 2 gathered edges in a double knot on top of the soap. Bring in each gathered edge so that the points of the triangles meet in the middle directly in the center of the soap. Tie the corners in a standard double knot at the top center of the soap to secure the fabric. Be sure to pull the triangles of fabric close to the soap so that the wrap is tight around it. Arrange the 2 loose tails in a decorative way to look like a bow. After tying the double knot, you will have 2 tails of leftover fabric on each side. Spread out the fabric and arrange it however you like, just like you would after tying a regular double knot with a ribbon.
