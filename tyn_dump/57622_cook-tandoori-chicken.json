Then, use a small paring knife to cut 2 to 3 diagonal slashes into each piece.Variation: If you don't want bones in the tandoori chicken, you can use boneless skinless pieces. Try to use thighs since breasts can dry out easily. Make the slashes at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) deep so the seasoning can penetrate the meat."

Put the plain yogurt into the filter and leave it for 20 to 30 minutes so excess liquid drips into the bowl. If you prefer, use plain Greek yogurt since it's so thick there's no need to strain it.
