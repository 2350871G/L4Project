You should find the water pump, then look at how much equipment must be removed to access it. Here are some things to look at to help you identify your water pump. Many water pumps have the cooling fan mounted on the front. They may also have a fan clutch attached to the fan itself. Most water pumps are mounted on the drive belt end of the engine. For conventional engines, this would be the front most area, for transverse engines, it would be the left side, facing the engine compartment from the from of the vehicle. The water pump will have at least two coolant hoses attached to it, usually between 1- 1/2 inch and 2 inch (5.1 cm) diameter, and may also have the heater core supply hoses (about 3/4 inch) attached as well."
