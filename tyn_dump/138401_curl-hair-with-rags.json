Take the end of your comb and create a part down the middle from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Comb the sections out again. Then create 2 more parts from the crown of your head to behind your ears. If you like, you can clip the sections of hair you\u2019re not using right away to keep them out of your way while you curl 1 of the sections at a time. Take a 1 in (2.5 cm) thick section of hair between your fingers. Starting with 1 of the front sections, take a section of hair in your fingers.
