The oven will preheat as you are preparing and forming the bread so that it will be hot enough by the time you are ready to bake it. De-stem the cauliflower. Rinse the head of cauliflower, then place it on a cutting board. Cut away the central stem of the cauliflower as well as any other stems so that you are left with the florets, or the bushy tops, of the cauliflower. If you don't cut away the stems, the bread will have a tougher and less fluffy consistency. You don't have to cut away every last bit of stem; just do your best to cut most of it away. Grind half the cauliflower in the food processor. Once you cut away the stems from the cauliflower, place half of the cauliflower florets in a food processor. Pulse the cauliflower on high until it is about the same texture as rice. After grinding, pour the ground cauliflower into a microwaveable bowl. Grind the rest of the cauliflower. Place the rest of the cauliflower florets in the food processor and grind until they reach the same texture as cauliflower you just ground. Then pour the rest of the cauliflower into the microwaveable bowl as well. Heating and Combining the Cauliflower With the Other Ingredients Microwave the cauliflower for 7 minutes. Even though you will bake the cauliflower into bread, you first need to cook the cauliflower in the microwave to get it soft. Place the bowl of ground cauliflower in the microwave, then microwave on high for 7 minutes. Squeeze cauliflower in cheesecloth.

Baking the Cauliflower Bread Prepare a baking sheet. Tear off a piece of parchment paper and use it to line a large baking sheet. Then spray the parchment paper lightly with non-stick cooking spray. Form the cauliflower mixture into squares. Scoop out the cauliflower mixture onto the baking sheet in four equally sized portions. Use your hands to form the mixture into four square that are about \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) thick. Make sure that the cauliflower squares are spaced out so that they don't overlap when baked. Bake the bread for 15-17 minutes. Once you form the cauliflower mixture into squares, place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake the bread for 15 minutes, then check on its progress. If the bread is golden, remove it from the oven. If not, let it cook for 2 more minutes and then take it out.
