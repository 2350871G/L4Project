                    "description": "About 20 minutes before you get the grill going, take your steaks out of the refrigerator and set them on the countertop. It\u2019s best to let tougher cuts of meat like flat iron steak warm up a few degrees before plopping them onto a hot grill to ensure that they cook evenly. Leave the steaks in the butcher paper or cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap while they warm up to keep bugs and bacteria out. If your steaks have been stored in the freezer, you'll need to thaw them out well ahead of time. The simplest way to do this is to just stick them in the refrigerator the night before you plan on cooking them. You can also place them in a cold water bath, adding fresh water every half hour. Make sure you don\u2019t leave the meat out for more than about an hour. The longer it remains at room temperature, the more likely it is to spoil."

Alternately, you can set the steaks in a shallow dish or on a large serving plate and pour your marinade over the top, using just enough to cover the bottom half. Marinating your steaks while they sit out is a good way to kill two birds with one stone. If you\u2019re marinating your steaks on a plate, be sure to turn them over at the halfway point so that both sides soak up the liquid. Get creative with your marinades. Flavors like soy, citrus, and garlic will compliment the meat especially well."

Add a few shakes to one or both sides of the steaks. The spices will coat the outside, giving it just enough kick to make things interesting. Try mixing up your own spice blends for steaks using ingredients like cayenne pepper, onion powder, ground ancho chiles, and cumin. Keep the hot spices conservative so they don't overpower the more versatile savory seasonings. Since flat iron steak is so lean, it has a tendency to be less flavorful than other, fattier cuts.
