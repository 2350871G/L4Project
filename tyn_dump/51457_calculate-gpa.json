You might also be able to figure out what grades you've received by going back over old report cards or transcripts. You want to collect the final grades for each of your classes. Individual class grades, midterm grades, or grades on mid-semester report cards do not count. Only final grades for the semester, term, or quarter factor into your GPA. Record the point value for each grade. Write down the correct point value next to each grade using the four-point scale. So, if you have an A- in a class, record a 3.7; if you have a C+, record a 2.3. For easy reference, use this chart from the College Board to help assign the correct 4.0-scale value. Add up all the values of your grades. After recording the scores for your grades, add the values up. So, let's say you received an A- in Biology, a B+ in English, and an B- in Economics. You'd add up the totals in the following way: 3.7 + 3.3 +  2.7 = 9.7. Take this final number and divide it by the number of classes you are taking. If you have a value of 9.7 on a 4-point scale for three classes, you will calculate the GPA using the following equation: 9.7 / 3 = 3.2. You have a GPA of 3.2. Calculating a GPA with Weighted Credit Hours Determine the number of credits. For some schools, especially college courses, each course has a number of credit hours. Credit hours are units schools use to measure the work load. Generally, credit hours are based on mode of instruction, number of hours spent inside the classroom, and number of hours spent studying outside the class.

You can also look on your report card or final grade sheets. Add .3 for each plus value or subtract .3 for each minus value. For example, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7. Type an equals sign (=) into the first cell of column D. All excel equations begin with an equals sign, so you should use one every time you do a new calculation.  Type the letters SUM. This will indicate to the program that it will be calculating a sum (adding) equation. Fill in your equation. The equation you will use to calculate your GPA will be determined by how many grades you have, but the basic format is =SUM(C1:C6)/6. C1 is the cell number (C- column, 1-row) of the first grade in your column. The number on the right side of the colon should be the cell number of the final grade on your list.
