As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10\u201311 inch (25.4\u201327.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove. Before playing regularly with your glove, it\u2019s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch."

The athletic position takes the following into effect:\nBend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused.
