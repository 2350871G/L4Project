Apply more hairspray to keep them in place for a longer period of time. Curling with Elastic Bands Mix water and hair gel together. Four or five drops of each will do. Wet a section of your hair. Separate your hair into four to nine sections. Dampen your palm with the water/gel mixture and gently pull a section three or four times to wet the hair. The more sections you use, the curlier your hair. Wrap the hair around an elastic band. Pull the section of hair through a large elastic band. Wrap the hair around the edge of the band, in and out.

Follow the same process with new elastic bands until all of your hair is wrapped. For best results, apply hairspray to keep your curls in place. Let your hair down in the morning. Go to sleep with this hair style and let it loose in the morning. Curling with the Cocoon Method Grab a small lock of hair. It's usually easiest to start at the back of your head, but you can start anywhere you find comfortable. If you have afro-textured hair, twist the hair for more exaggerated curls. The cocoon method can be more difficult than the methods above. Give yourself plenty of time to learn it. Place two fingers against the hair.

Check out this article for instructions on \"plopping.\" All you need is a towel and a T-shirt for overnight curls. Wear rollers. Wrap small sections of hair around each roller to make a tight curl. Leave in overnight and remove in the morning. Tie socks into your hair. Section your hair into four to eight sections, depending on its thickness.
