                    "description": "This is generally the most common method credit card companies use to calculate a finance charge. It is also the most expensive, as new purchases and balances are accounted for immediately with no grace period to avoid accruing interest. Some credit card companies allow a grace period between the purchase date and the date the bill is due, so that if you pay your bill completely on time, there is no interest charged. Add up the outstanding balance for each day in your billing period. Include any new purchases made to this balance. For example, if your balance was $180 for 10 days, you get $1,800. Then, say your balance was $110 for 5 days. You get $550. Then, for 15 days, your balance was $90. You get $1,350. Once you have a range of numbers spanning the complete billing cycle, add all these numbers together. For example, $1,800 plus $550 plus $1,350 comes to $3,700. Divide this number by the total number of days in your billing cycle. Most billing cycles are 30 to 31 days. The number you get is the average daily balance that is then used to calculate the interest owed. For the above example, the average daily balance would be 3,700 divided by 30, coming to approximately $124. The finance charge is the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) adjusted for the number of billing cycles in a year times the average daily balance. For example, if the APR is 18% with 12 billing cycles, the monthly rate would be 1.5%. The finance charge would be the 1.5% of the average daily balance."
