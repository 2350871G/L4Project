Rub the inside and bottom of the dish with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. You should also coat one side of the parchment paper with butter or oil. Set the dish and paper aside. Season the chicken and place it in the dish. Take a paper towel and pat two boneless, skinless chicken breasts dry. Spread a little of the butter or oil over the chicken, if you like. Sprinkle some salt and pepper over the chicken breasts and set them into the prepared dish. The chicken shouldn't touch. You can use your favorite seasoning to add extra flavor. For example, set sprigs of fresh rosemary or sliced lemon around the chicken. You can bake as many chicken breasts as you need with this method. Ensure that they'll fit in the pan without touching. Press the buttered parchment on the chicken. Place the buttered side of the parchment paper directly onto the seasoned chicken breasts. Push the sides of the paper down into the pan and around the meat. You should try to completely cover the chicken so it doesn't dry out as it bakes. Bake the chicken for 20 minutes. Put the dish of chicken in the preheated oven. Set it on the middle rack so it cooks evenly. Check the temperature and bake the chicken for 10 to 20 more minutes. Insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of a chicken breast to check the temperature. If it reads at least 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), you can take it out of the oven. If it hasn't, cook the chicken for 10 to 20 more minutes until it reaches temperature. Serve or store the chicken. Remove the chicken from the oven and peel off the parchment paper. You can serve the cooked chicken breasts, slice them to use in a recipe, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator. You can store the cooked chicken breasts for up to one week. Grilling Turn on or heat a grill. If you're using a gas grill, turn the heat to high. If you're using a charcoal grill, heat a chimney full of briquettes (about 100) until they're slightly ashy. Pour the coals over half of the grate so you have two zones of heat. Set the grilling grate over the coals and open the vents on the grill. Oil the grate. Dip a paper towel in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil. Grip the paper towel with tongs and rub the oil over the grill grate to prevent the chicken from sticking as it cooks. Season the chicken breasts. Sprinkle four boneless, skinless chicken breasts with salt and pepper. You can also brine, marinate, or coat the chicken breasts with your favorite seasonings and flavors. Sear the chicken breast for three to four minutes. Place the chicken breasts on the preheated grill. If you're using a charcoal grill, lay the chicken breasts on the grill grate directly over the coals. Grill the chicken for three to four minutes so they brown a little. You can keep the lid off of the grill while you're searing the outside of the meat. Turn and sear the chicken for another three to four minutes. Use long tongs to carefully flip the chicken breasts over. Grill them for three to four more minutes directly over the heat. Grill the chicken breasts until they reach 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). Move the chicken breasts to the cooler half of the grill or lower the heat on your gas grill to medium-high. Put the lid on the grill and cook the meat until an instant-read thermometer reads 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). The amount of grilling time will vary greatly depending on how thick your chicken breasts are, especially if you've cut large breasts in half. Rest the chicken breasts for five minutes. Transfer the cooked, boneless, skinless chicken breasts to a serving platter or a cutting board. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil loosely over the meat and let the breasts rest for five minutes. Serve or store the chicken breasts. Serve the grilled chicken breasts with your favorite sauces or sides after the resting period. For example, consider coating the cooked chicken breasts with barbecue sauce. Or slice the breasts into strips and serve them with a peanut dipping sauce. Store the leftover grilled chicken breasts in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to five days. Saut\u00e9ing Pound and season the chicken breasts. Get out one to four boneless, skinless chicken breasts and set them on a cutting board. Use a rolling pin or the bottom of a heavy bottle to pound the chicken breasts until they're an even thickness. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and freshly ground pepper. You can flatten the chicken breasts as thin as you like. Keep in mind that they'll cook faster if they're thinner. Heat the oil and cook the chicken breasts for one minute. Place 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil or unsalted butter into a wide saut\u00e9 pan that's at least 10 inches (25 cm) in size. Turn the heat to medium-high and add the chicken breasts to the pan. Cook the chicken for one minute without moving it. Turn the chicken breasts and reduce the heat. Use tongs or a spatula to flip the chicken breasts over. Turn the heat down to low and continue to cook the chicken breasts. Cover and cook the chicken for 10 minutes. Put a tight-fitting lid on the pan and cook the chicken breasts for 10 minutes without lifting the lid at all. The chicken breasts should steam a little in the pan during this time. Turn off the heat and rest the chicken for 10 minutes. Leave the lid on the pan and don't open it while the chicken rests. It should finish cooking as it rests for 10 minutes. If you have an electric stove, move the pan to a cold burner so the chicken won't overcook. Check the temperature and serve the chicken breasts. Take the lid off of the pan and insert an instant-read thermometer into one of the breasts. The temperature should reach 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) once the chicken has finished cooking. If the chicken hasn't finished cooking, turn the heat on to medium and saut\u00e9 the chicken breasts for a few more minutes. Check the temperature again. Serve or store the chicken breasts. Once the chicken has come to temperature, lift the breasts out of the pan and serve or slice them. You can store the leftover chicken breasts in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to five days. Slow Cooking Grease the slow cooker and season the chicken breasts. Spray the inside of a slow cooker with cooking spray to prevent the chicken from sticking. Sprinkle two to four boneless, skinless chicken breasts with salt and pepper. You can also season the chicken with fresh herbs or your favorite spices. If you're only cooking one or two breasts, you can use a smaller slow cooker.

Cook the chicken breasts for three hours. Turn the slow cooker on to LOW and let the meat cook for about three hours. It should become completely cooked through. Check the temperature and remove the breasts. Insert an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature. The chicken should reach 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) once it's finished cooking.
