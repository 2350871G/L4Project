Many black teas can have light, fruity flavors, while others are stronger and tend towards malt or citrus flavors. There are even dessert teas that include flavors such as mint, chocolate, or vanilla. A few popular varieties of black tea include:\nOrange Pekoe: A very common black tea that has a sweet aftertaste\nIrish Breakfast: A blend of different black teas that often has a strong, sometimes malty flavor\nCeylon: A light-colored black tea that smells like citrus\nEnglish Breakfast: A strong blend of black teas that pairs well with milk and sugar\nDarjeeling: A light, fruity black tea that is only grown in the Darjeeling region of West Bengal, India. Be sure to check the label when purchasing, as there are green Darjeeling teas as well. Earl Grey: A popular blend of black tea that is flavored with bergamot, giving it a crisp, citrusy flavor"
