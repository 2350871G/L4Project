    "text": " Making French Sorrel Soup Melt butter in a pot. Set your stove for medium heat. Measure out about three tablespoons (45 mL) of butter. Wait for the butter to melt. Add vegetables to the butter. Chop up about \u00bd cup (120 mL) green onion. Wild onion, another spring harvest plant, can be used instead of store-bought onion. The soup can be made with only onion and sorrel, but you may also add celery, carrot, and lentils. Simmer for ten minutes. Turn the stove\u2019s heat down to a medium-low setting. Cover the pot and let the onion cook for about ten minutes. You may also stir the vegetables from time to time to make sure they get a little soft but don\u2019t change color. Simmer stock in a separate pot. Pour a quart (950 mL) of chicken or vegetable stock into a pot. Turn the heat setting on another burner to low and bring the stock to a simmer. Add sorrel to the stock. Turn up the heat. Use about four to six cups (950-1900 mL) of chopped sorrel leaves. Add a pinch of salt along with the sorrel and stir the stock. Watch the sorrel, since it wilts quickly. Cook the sorrel with low heat. Once you notice that the sorrel has wilted, lower the heat on the stock to medium-low. Cover the pot and cook the sorrel for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix in flour. After ten minutes, add three tablespoons (45 mL) of flour. Stir it into the stock. Raise the heat to medium and let the stock cook for three minutes. Combine the stock with the vegetables. Pour the stock into the pot with the onions and other vegetables you used. Use a whisk to stir the pot as you do this. Keep this pot at a simmer. Whisk egg yolk and cream. Combine two egg yolks with \u00bd cup (120 mL) cream in a separate bowl. To prevent the eggs from scrambling, ladle in three spoonfuls of soup as you whisk the egg and cream with the other hand. Afterwards, whisk the mixture into the remaining soup. Cook the soup for five minutes. Add a tablespoon (15 mL) of butter to the soup. Turn the heat down low so the soup does not simmer. After five minutes, the soup will be ready to serve. Cooking Salmon with Sorrel Sauce Slice up the sorrel. After rinsing and drying sorrel leaves, pack the leaves tightly together, layering a couple at a time on top of one another. Roll the leaves from the side until they are in the shape of a cigar. With a sharp knife, cut the roll into thin ribbons. \u00bc pound (.11 kg) of leaves should give you about two cups (475 mL) of sorrel. Begin cooking the salmon. Slice up 1 \u00bd lb (.68 kg) salmon. Combine it with one tablespoon (15 mL) of shallots, dry white wine, and \u00bd cup (120 mL) chopped tomatoes in a saucepan. One way to make the sauce is to add cream to the wine after simmering, then combine it with wilted sorrel. Simmer your cream. Add \u2154 cup (160 mL) of heavy cream to a cooking pot. Heat the cream and then turn down the heat to keep it at a simmer. This prevents it from curdling under the sorrel\u2019s acidic properties. Heat the butter and sorrel. In a separate pot, combine three tablespoons (700 mL) of butter and along with the sorrel. Use medium heat to melt the butter and begin cooking the sorrel. Stir often until the ingredients melt into a strong green color. Stir in the cream and stock. Remove the simmering cream from its pot and pour it into the sorrel mixture. Stir the ingredients together and turn down the heat to keep them at a low simmer. Add two tablespoons (30 mL) of chicken stock, vegetable stock, or vermouth. Add salt and white pepper. Taste the sauce and add as much salt and pepper as you\u2019d like for flavoring. You may also add more stock or vermouth to further thin the sauce. Baking a Sorrel Tart Cook onions until soft. Slice up one medium sweet onion and add it to a heavy pot. Add \u00bc teaspoon (1.25 mL) salt and two tablespoons (30 mL) of butter. Turn the heat to medium-low.

Add one tablespoon (15 mL) of flour to the onions. Stir the pot to mix the flour and onions evenly. Allow the mixture to cook for two minutes. Wilt the sorrel. Add five oz. (141.7 g) of sorrel leaves to the onions and stir to distribute them. Cover the pot and allow it to cook for one minute. The sorrel will quickly wilt. Move the pot away from the heat. You may wish to shred the sorrel to spread out the tart flavor. Combine the filling. In a separate bowl, crack open two eggs.

Dump the whisked egg into the pot with the sorrel and onions. Also, add in 2.5 oz (70.9 g) grated Gruyere cheese. Sprinkle cheese into the tart shell.
