Lastly, write down rising agents and alcohol in the last column. Write \u201cTimes 2\u201d above the main ingredients column and above the liquids column.

Finish the calculations below, then double check your ingredients list on the original recipe to make sure you\u2019ve included everything. Rewrite your ingredients in list form according to the \u201cdouble\u201d measure you have calculated. Doubling Main Ingredients Multiply the amount of all the vegetables and fruits by 2. This will provide the bulk of your recipe. Write down the new amount in your first column. Increase the flour in a recipe by 2. You will change your rising agent later on, according to the amount of flour you are using. Write down the new amount of flour you need. Double the amount of meat you must purchase. Remember that cooking larger chunks of meat may require increased cooking time. Write down the new lb. or g measurement. Double the amount of eggs you will use exactly.  Doubling Liquids Increase the amount of water you use by a multiple of 2. Write this down in the liquids column. If you need 2 cups of water, you now need 4. Use twice as much stock. Write this number down in the liquids column. Leave alcohol-based ingredients, such as sherry, wine, beer and spirits to the special ingredients section. Alcohol has a stronger flavor and will become too concentrated if doubled. Consider ingredients like soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and other concentrated sauces to be seasonings.

However, don\u2019t double the amount of olive oil or butter you use in the pan with saut\u00e9ing. The aim should be to use enough to cover the pan you are using, so if you use a bigger pan, you use as much as you need to cover the pan. Increasing Seasonings Multiply your spices, like salt, pepper and cinnamon, by 1.5 times the original recipe. If your recipe calls for 2 tsp. (12.2 g) of salt, you now need 3 tsp. (18.3 g) of salt. You may need to use a calculator to write down an accurate measurement. Increase chili peppers and other hot spices by 1.25 times the original recipe. This includes curry powders, garlic powders and fresh hot peppers. Increase salty, peppery and concentrated sauces by 1.5 times the original amount. If a sauce has alcohol in it, you may want to only increase it by 1.25 times. Increasing Special Ingredients (The Exceptions) Use 1.5 times the amount of alcohol in the recipe. Try to avoid \u201ceyeing it\u201d and pouring based on instinct, if you are doubling the recipe for the first time. Recalculate your baking soda quantity. To rise properly, you need 1/4 tsp.
