For a standard vertical envelope, try making the cardstock 7.5 by 10.5 inches (19.05 by 26.67 cm). You may also make a horizontal one using a measurement such as 9.5 by 10 inches (24.13 by 25.4 cm). These measurements are meant to include a one inch (2.54 cm) flap at the top. Cardstock, along with all other supplies, can be found at craft stores."
