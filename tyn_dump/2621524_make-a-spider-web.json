Use store-bought plastic or furry spider toys, or make your own from pipe cleaners or similar items. Using Pipe Cleaners (Chenille) Gather three white or black pipe cleaners for each web. Pipe cleaners are pliable wires that are covered in fluffy fabric. You can try other colors if you're feeling adventurous. Pipe cleaners can be found at local arts and crafts stores like Michael's or Hobby Lobby. Form the frame of your web. Twist two pipe cleaners together at the exact center of each stick to form an \"X\". Twist the third pipe cleaner down the center of the \"X\", creating what looks like a snowflake shape. The sticks should be spread out in a circle, leaving even gaps between each stick. This forms the web framework.

Don't overdo this--just a few strands here and there will give the effect of loose webs. Hang the curtain. Use some of the embroidery thread to hold the curtain in place as if spiders have tied up the curtain while they were weaving. Hang over a good light source, like a window or anyplace like a skylight or a screen with a light behind it. Using Cheesecloth Obtain cheesecloth. Cheesecloth is a very loose cotton that resembles gauze. You can find it in craft stores like Jo-Ann Fabric or Bed Bath and Beyond. Measure and secure the cheesecloth. Measure the area where you will be hanging the web and measure and cut the cheesecloth accordingly. Secure the cheesecloth in place with pins or glue. Cut vertical strips in the cloth. Remember, the web is meant to look old and unfinished so vary the lengths and spacing of the vertical strips. Cut from the bottom up. Tear the fabric.
