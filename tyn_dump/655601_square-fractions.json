To square a whole number, you multiply it by itself. For example:\n5 = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 Realize that squaring fractions works the same way. To square a fraction, you multiply the fraction by itself. Another way to think about it is to multiply the numerator by itself and then the denominator by itself. For example:\n(/2) = /2 \u00d7 /2 or (/2). Squaring each number yields (/4). Multiply the numerator by itself and the denominator by itself. The actual order that you multiply these numbers by themselves doesn\u2019t matter as long as you have squared both numbers. To keep things simple, start with the numerator: simply multiply it by itself. Then, multiply the denominator by itself. The numerator will stay on top of the fraction and the denominator will stay at the bottom of the fraction. For example: (/2) = (/2 x 2) = (/4). Simplify the fraction to finish. When working with fractions, the last step is always to reduce the fraction to its most simple form or turn the improper fraction into a mixed number. For our example, /4 is an improper fraction because the numerator is larger than the denominator. To convert to a mixed number, divide 4 into 25. It goes in 6 times (6 x 4 = 24) with 1 leftover. Therefore, the mixed number is 6 /4. Squaring Fractions with Negative Numbers Recognize the negative sign in front of the fraction. If you are working with a negative fraction, it will have a minus sign in front of it. It is good practice to always put parentheses around a negative number so you know that the \u201c\u2013\u201c sign is referring to the number and not telling you to subtract two numbers. For example: (\u2013/4) Multiply the fraction by itself. Square the fraction as you would normally by multiplying the numerator by itself and then multiplying the denominator by itself. Alternatively, you can simply multiply the fraction by itself. For example: (\u2013/4) = (\u2013/4) x (\u2013/4) Understand that two negative numbers multiply to make a positive number. When a minus sign is present, the entire fraction is negative. When you square the fraction, you are multiplying two negative numbers together. Whenever two negative numbers are multiplied together, they make a positive number. For example: (-2) x (-8) = (+16) Remove the negative sign after squaring. After you have squared the fraction, you will have multiplied two negative numbers together. This means that the squared fraction will be positive. Be sure to write your final answer without the negative sign. Continuing the example, the resulting fraction will be a positive number.
