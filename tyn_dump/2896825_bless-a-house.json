The blessing may be performed by an ordained priest or pastor, or by the owner of the house themselves. If you would prefer to have your house blessed by an ordained priest, invite him to your house to perform the blessing, and he will be happy to oblige. Normally, the priest will walk from room to room, sprinkling each with holy water. As he walks, he may recite one or more passages from the holy gospel. If you prefer to bless the house yourself, use anointing oil (which can simply be cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil, blessed by a minister) to mark a cross on each of the windows and doors inside the house. As you mark the sign of the cross, utter a simple prayer asking God to bless the room. For example \"In the name of Jesus Christ I ask for Your peace and joy to inhabit this room,\" or \"May Your Holy Spirit flow through and fill this home up with Your Spirit.\""

When moving into a new home, Jewish families are required to affix a mezuzah (parchment inscribed with Hebrew phrases from the Torah) to each of the doorways in the house. As the mezuzah is installed, the following prayer is recited \"Blessed are You, L-rd our G-d, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix a mezuzah\". It is also believed that Tuesday is the best day for moving into a new home, that bread and salt should be the first items to enter the house, and that shortly after moving in a Chanukat Habayit or housewarming party should be held, where friends and family gather and words of the Torah are spoken. During the housewarming party, it's tradition to eat the first fruit of the new season while reciting the shehecheyanu blessing, as follows: \"Blessed are You, L-rd our G\u2011d, King of the Universe, who has granted us life, sustained us and enabled us to reach this occasion.\""
