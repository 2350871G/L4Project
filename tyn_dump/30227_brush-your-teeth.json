                    "description": "Choose a toothbrush with soft nylon bristles. This must effectively remove plaque and debris from your teeth, without irritating the gums or eroding tooth enamel like hard-bristled brushes can do when used with sideways action. The toothbrush should also fit comfortably in your hand, and have a head small enough to easily reach all of your teeth, especially the ones at the back. If you have difficulty fitting the toothbrush into your mouth, it is probably too big. Electric toothbrushes are a great choice if you are a lazy brusher and think that the electric toothbrush might encourage you to spend more time on your teeth; however, you can do just as good of a job with a manual toothbrush \u2014 it's all in the technique. One good method is to brush with a manual toothbrush in the morning and use an electric toothbrush at night. You should avoid toothbrushes with \"natural\" bristles made from animal hair as these can harbor bacteria and must be replaced more frequently."

You should purchase a new toothbrush every three to four months, or as soon as the bristles start to splay and lose their shape. Visual inspection of the toothbrush is more important than the actual timeline. You can also buy toothbrushes whose handles will change color when it's time to purchase a new toothbrush. Research has found that thousands of microbes call toothbrush bristles and handles \"home,\" and can cause infections. At about three months, bristles become sharp due to friction and can cause your gums to bleed. Always rinse your brush after using it, and store it upright and uncovered so that it can dry before your next use. Otherwise bacteria will grow."

You should always floss before brushing your teeth so that any food or bacteria that comes loose during flossing doesn't remain in your mouth. Remember to floss gently. Don't \"snap\" the floss between the teeth as this can  irritate sensitive gums. Ease it down gently, following the curve of each tooth. If you find dental floss awkward to use, or you have braces, look for dental picks instead. These are small wooden or plastic sticks that you can insert between teeth, achieving the same results as flossing if spaces are large enough. Alternatively, you can use flossers, which are small pieces of floss strung between 2 supports, generally with a pick at the opposite end."
