        "You can look in your owner\u2019s manual or service manual if you are unsure which spark plug is number one on your vehicle.",
        "It is not necessarily the first one on either end of the block.",
        "Set your park brake.",
        "Make sure that your car is parked safely and that it will not move while you are working.",
        "Turn on your engine.",
        "You should let the engine warm up before checking the timing.",
        "This will yield the most accurate results.",
        "Connect your timing light to your number one spark plug wire.",
        "Clip the lead over the plug wire and turn on the light.",
        "Be sure that you are using the number one plug, otherwise your readings will be incorrect.",
        "Aim the timing light at the timing mark.",
        "When the spark plug fires, it will cause the strobe on the light to flash.",
        "This will show you what number the timing mark is on at the time the piston fires.",
        "Record these numbers.",
        "Interpret the results of your timing test.",
        "The numbers represent degrees from top dead center (TDC) of the piston in the number one cylinder.",
        "What this means, is that the mark indicates how far from the top the piston is when the spark ignites the fuel.",
        "If your numbers are in the range specified in your owner\u2019s manual or service manual, your timing does not need adjusted.",
        "If not, you will need to adjust your timing to fix the knocking."
