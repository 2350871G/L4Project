The combination of heat and gentle abrasion will go to work on the worst of the caked-on crud in the pan before you ever lift a finger. When cleaning particularly large pans, you can use as many as 8-10 drops, or drizzle a thin line of soap along the walls and bottom surface."

Be sure to rinse away all traces of the soap solution. If you allow it to dry on the pan, it may leave behind a waxy film, which could affect the taste of future confections. If you'd prefer to let your pan air-dry, place it upside down on a drying rack or mat to prevent water from collecting at the bottom. A good soak should be enough to deal with most light messes.
