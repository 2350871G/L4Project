Oil repels water, which means that pouring H20 on an oil stain could permanently set the stain making it almost impossible to remove it later. Do not launder your jeans before treating the stain. This is a common mistake that should be avoided. Once the stain on your jeans comes in contact with water, it might actually become more difficult to remove it if the laundering doesn't get rid of it, that is. Lay out your jeans on an area that you don't mind staining. It's important to find a surface on which to place your stained garment. Make sure that it's okay if that surface gets dirty or otherwise compromised. Sometimes, while removing stains, the garment's color can fade through, and get onto whatever is beneath. The bathtub might be a place to consider. Get an old, but clean, rag or cloth. Depending on the stain, you'll be doing a fair amount of blotting. Old socks, T-shirts, and/or kitchen rags will do just fine as long as they're clean and preferably of light color. There's always a chance that the rag's color could seep onto your stained jeans, which would defy our present objective. Get a medium-sized plastic tub.

Use just enough baking soda and water to make a paste-like texture. Then, get an clean toothbrush and firmly apply the paste to the area. Gently scrub back and forth, then let the stain sit for a few hours. Finally, rinse the stain. Crush three Aspirin pills. Put them in a cup. Then, add about two tablespoons of water until the mixture becomes paste-like. Apply it onto the stain, and let it sit for an hour. Rinse the stained part of the garment. Get some lemon juice. Lightly sprinkle salt onto the stain. Then squeeze some lemon juice onto the stain until it's saturated. Rub the stain until it's gone, and then launder your jeans. This is a great preventative measure as well. You could use the mixture on shirts you know you'll sweat in (like gym shirts). Keep in mind that lemon juice might lighten your jeans' color. Removing Wine And Food Get a hold of white wine. It might seem counter intuitive, but white wine actually works great on red wine spots (they neutralize one another). Simply pour white wine over the red wine spot right before doing laundry. Then, toss your jeans in and wash normally. If this didn't work for you, try one of the steps below. Use table salt. Pour a little bit of salt onto the stain and let it sit for about five minutes. Rub the stain with a rag/cloth while rinsing it out with cold water, or club soda. Repeat this action until the stain vanishes. Then, wash your jeans. Get some eggs out. Egg yolks work particularly well on coffee stains. Mix one egg yolk with a couple of drops of rubbing alcohol and warm water. Take a sponge and apply the mixture to the coffee spot. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, then rinse. Wash your jeans as usual. Use club soda. Mix club soda and a teaspoon of salt in a cup, then apply it directly to the stain. Let it soak in overnight for best results. As previously mentioned, avoid all types of water on greasy stains. Club soda and salt work especially well on coffee stains. Removing Dirt Stains Keep it very simple for plain dirt stains. Turn your jeans inside out, and just flush out the spot from behind. Simply apply tepid water to the stain with a clean rag/cloth until the stain disappears. If this step wasn't enough to make your stain disappear, try one or more of the following steps below. Use shampoo. For old and deep-set stains, put your jeans in a plastic tub filled with warm water. Put some shampoo on a sponge, and scrub the stain vigorously while it's soaking in water. Repeat until the spot is gone. Add vinegar to your regular laundry cycle. Pour a cup of white vinegar to your laundry cycle, and run your wash. Adding white vinegar to your laundry acts similarly to bleach, but it's less aggressive. Note: this trick is only meant for white jeans. Brush the dirt stain lightly with a toothbrush. If the stain is fresh, and most importantly, not from completely liquid dirt you might be able to lightly brush the dirt of your jeans fabric. But be careful as rough brushing might help the dirt penetrate into the jeans.",

        " Getting Started Resist the instinct to immediately rub the stain with water.",
        "This is particularly important if you think the stain might be oil-based or grease.",
        "Oil repels water, which means that pouring H20 on an oil stain could permanently set the stain making it almost impossible to remove it later.",
        "Do not launder your jeans before treating the stain.",
        "This is a common mistake that should be avoided.",
        "Once the stain on your jeans comes in contact with water, it might actually become more difficult to remove it if the laundering doesn't get rid of it, that is.",
        "Lay out your jeans on an area that you don't mind staining.",
        "It's important to find a surface on which to place your stained garment.",
        "Make sure that it's okay if that surface gets dirty or otherwise compromised.",
        "Sometimes, while removing stains, the garment's color can fade through, and get onto whatever is beneath.",
        "The bathtub might be a place to consider.",
        "Get an old, but clean, rag or cloth.",
        "Depending on the stain, you'll be doing a fair amount of blotting.",

        "The longer a stain is left untreated, the tougher it'll be to get rid of it.",

        "Use a quarter teaspoon of the meat tenderizer, add a little cold water, and mix it into a paste.",
        "Work the paste into the blood stain.",
        "Let it set in for about fifteen minutes, then rinse out your jeans.",

        "Removing Makeup Stay away from water.",
        "Most makeup, like lip-stick or mascara, is oil-based which means that water will help the stain set, and make it harder to remove it.",
        "Brush the stain off gently.",
        "Some makeup isn't liquid, which means that it's sometimes possible to lightly brush a lip-stick or mascara stain off before it seeps into the fabric.",
