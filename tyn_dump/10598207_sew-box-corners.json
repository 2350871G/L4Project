Use safety pins to secure the corners before you sew! If you like the way it looks, then add box corners to the item. Adding Box Corners to Raw Fabric Measure the length, height, and width of the surface. Use a measuring tape to find the dimensions of the item you want to cover. Write down these dimensions. This will allow you to create a custom sized cover for the item, such a for a tablecloth or fitted sheet. Add the length to the height and 2x the desired seam allowance. Use a calculator to ensure that you get an accurate result. This will give you the length you need to cut out of your fabric. Label your result as the fabric length.

Insert a pin every 2 in (5.1 cm) along the raw edges of the fabric. Arrange the pins so that they are perpendicular to the raw edges to make it easier to pull them out as you sew.
