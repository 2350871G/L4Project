        "Young children may need and adult's help for this step.",
        "If you made a \"very hungry\" caterpillar, use a red cup and a green cup for this step.",
        "Make sure that the holes match up.",
        "They should be in the center of the edge.",
        "Poke two holes in the next four cups.",
        "This time, poke the holes straight across from each other.",
        "You will need one hole on the left side edge, and another hole for the right side edge.",
        "These will make the body pf the caterpillar.",
        "Make sure that the holes are aligned.",
        "Thread your first cup onto a piece of string or yarn.",
        "Cut a piece of string that's longer than all six cups put together.",
        "Tie a knot at one end, then thread it through a yarn needle.",
        "Take one of your single-hole cups, and push the needle through it.",
        "Make sure that the needle comes out on the outside.",
        "If the knot falls out of the hole, tie a bead around the end of the string instead.",
        "Add the rest of the cups, then tie the string off.",
        "Thread the two-hole cups onto the string.",
        "Finish off with the other single-hole cup.",
        "Tie another knot at the end of the string.",
        "If you have any string left over, cut it off.",
        "Poke two holes in the head for the antenna.",
        "Flip the caterpillar over so that you can see the bottoms of the cups.",
        "Choose an end to be the head.",
        "Use a pair of sharp scissors or a pencil to poke two holes in the top of the head.",
        "If you made a \"very hungry\" caterpillar, the red end is the head.",
        "Cut a pipe cleaner in half, then feed it through the holes.",
        "Flip the caterpillar over so that you can see the inside.",
        "Poke each end of the cut pipe cleaner through a hole.",
        "Flip the caterpillar back over, then twist the ends of the pipe cleaner together.",
        "Spread open the pipe cleaner to make a V. Save the other half of the pipe cleaner for another project.",
        "If the antenna are still too long, cut them down with scissors.",
        "Decorate the caterpillar.",
        "Draw a face onto the head, just below the antenna.",
        "Use a pencil to curl the antenna, or glue pompoms to the tips.",
        "Here are some more ways to decorate the caterpillar:\nGlue a pompom to the top of each cup.",
        "Glue on googly eyes instead of drawing them.",
        "Paint spots or stripes onto the caterpillar.",
        "Draw on some eyelashes, eyebrows, or a silly tongue.",
        "Making a Planter Caterpillar Cut apart an egg carton.",
        "Choose an egg carton with deep cups that are all connected.",
        "Avoid the ones with \"prongs\" in the middle.",
        "Cut the lid and side flaps off of the egg carton.",
        "Next, cut the carton down the middle so that you have two strips.",
        "A 12-cup egg carton will work the best, but you can use a smaller one too.",
        "This method will turn your caterpillar into a flower pot for small seeds, such as grass.",
        "Trim the excess cardboard away from each cup so that the edges are nice and smooth.",
        "Paint the outside of the cups.",
        "Flip the strip over so that you can see the bottom and outside of the cups.",
        "Paint the cups a bright color.",
        "Acrylic paint will work the best, but you can use poster and tempera paint too.",
        "Paint the inside of the cups with clear, waterproof, acrylic sealer to keep the caterpillar from getting soggy.",
        "Poke two holes into the edge of the strip for the antenna.",
        "Turn the strip so that the inside is facing you.",
        "Punch two holes into one of the narrow ends of the strip, close to the top.",
        "You can do this with scissors or a pencil.",
        "Cut a pipe cleaner in half, then feed it through the holes to make the antenna.",
        "Feed the pipe cleaner through the inside of the cup, so that it comes out the front.",
        "Twist the ends together, then bend them upwards.",
        "Spread the pipe cleaner apart to make a V shape.",
        "Glue a small pompom to the tips, or curl them with a pencil.",
        "If the antenna are still too long for you, cut them shorter.",
        "Give the caterpillar a face.",
        "Glue two googly eyes to the front of the strip, just below the pipe cleaner antenna.",
        "Use a marker to draw a small face beneath the eyes.",
        "If you don't have googly eyes, you can draw the eyes instead.",
        "Add lashes to make the caterpillar a girl.",
        "Fill the cups with damp dirt.",
        "Get some soil from the garden or a flower nursery.",
        "Add enough water to make it damp.",
        "Use a spoon to fill each cup with soil, about \u00bc-inch (0.5 centimeter) from the rim.",
        "Sprinkle grass seeds over the dirt.",
        "You want to use a pinch of seeds for each cup in case they don't all grow.",
        "You can also try herbs, like basil or chives.",
        "Cover the seeds with more dirt, then let them grow!",
        "Remember to water the seeds often.",
        "If you planted grass, you need to water them every day.",
        "Do not water them too much, or the caterpillar will get soggy and fall apart.",
        "The caterpillar will eventually fall apart.",
        "When that happens, cut the cups apart and plant them in your garden.",
        "If you used grass, use scissors to give the caterpillar a haircut!",
        "If you have a cat, be aware that he or she may try to eat the grass."
