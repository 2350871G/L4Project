While your stove will run on lower-grade material, better pellets are more efficient and produce less ash. In the long run, good fuel saves you money since it does less damage to your stove over time. An example of premium fuel is softwood pellets with less than .5% ash in them. When burning pellets, buy a small bag of pellets and try them out before you purchase more. Watch them go through your stove to make sure they don\u2019t crumble and clog it."
