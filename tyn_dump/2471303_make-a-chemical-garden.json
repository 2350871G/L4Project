A beaker between 200 milliliters (6.8  fl oz) and 500mL should work well. This will allow you to make the silica solution and assemble the chemical garden all in the same container. A chemistry beaker works well because it can be heated and because it may have measurements on the side that allow you to measure the correct amount of water to start your solution."

This will help protect you from the potential chemical burns or contact with known carcinogens that can come from skin contact with certain metal. You may also want to wear something to cover your clothes. This could be either an apron or a lab coat. You will also need a pair of forceps or tweezers that you can use to handle the metal salts.

This consists of 32 grams (1.1 oz) of sodium hydroxide and 48 grams (1.7 oz) of crushed silica gel beads. You will also need metal salts to add to the solution. These can vary widely, depending on what you want to use and what is available to you. Metals salts to use include copper sulphate (produces blue), nickel nitrate (produces green), iron chloride (produces orange), manganese chloride (produces purple), cobalt chloride (produces red), and magnesium sulfate (produces pink). Each one will produce a different color and will grow at a different rate. You can purchase all of these chemicals online.

You also want to assure that the area is clear of clutter and can be cleaned if you happen to accidentally drop any of the metal salts outside of the beaker. If are doing this project on a table that you don't want accidentally damaged, consider covering it with newspaper. This paper should be taped down, so that it doesn't move and cause your beaker to move as well. When doing a chemistry project, it's a good idea to do it in an area that has good ventilation. This will allow you to avoid the dangers of chemicals mixing and producing fumes. However, this project, as described, should not produce any toxic fumes or gases."
