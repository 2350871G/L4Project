Stir in 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of salt and 1 1/2 tablespoons (21 g) of butter or margarine. Bring the water to a boil. Turn the heat on to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil. The butter should melt and combine with the water. Turn off the heat and stir in the milk. If you don't want to use the 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk, you could stir in chicken stock, vegetable stock, or water. Stir in the instant potato flakes and let them stand for 30 seconds. Measure 1 cup (60 g) of instant potato flakes into the pot. Stir the instant potatoes well so they absorb the liquid. Rest the instant potatoes for about 30 seconds to fully hydrate and expand. Fluff the instant mashed potatoes and serve them. Take a fork and gently fluff or whip the mashed potatoes. Divide the mashed potatoes into three portions and serve them immediately. You can store leftover instant mashed potatoes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to five days. Using the Microwave Measure the water, salt, butter, and milk into a bowl.

Stir in 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of salt and 1 1/2 tablespoons (21 g) of butter or margarine. If you don't want to use milk, you could substitute chicken stock, vegetable stock, or extra water.
