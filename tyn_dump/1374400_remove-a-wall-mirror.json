To cut through the adhesive on the back, get a wire saw, which is a length of sharp wire with two handles on the ends. You can purchase a wire saw at your local construction or auto parts store.Warning: Removing a glass mirror is dangerous. If the glass cracks, you run the risk of cutting yourself. The cleanup process will also be a nightmare, since glass shards are going to get everywhere. Remove a wall mirror at your own discretion. Wire saws are sometimes referred to as cutout wire or razor wire. They\u2019re used to cut through tough angles and rely on friction to slice through thicker materials. This method is preferable for mirrors larger than 2 by 2 ft (0.61 by 0.61 m). The wire saw must be at least 1 ft (30 cm) longer than the width of the mirror."

The blow dryer will take longer to heat the adhesive than the heat gun, so wait at least 30 minutes if you\u2019re using a hair dryer instead. If you see the mirror move or slide down the wall a little, the glue is already melted. Simply turn the heat off and wait 1 minute for the glue to cool a little.

        "If it falls to the floor, you will end up with shards of glass everywhere that will be very hard to clean up.",
        "Work carefully and slowly to ensure that you don\u2019t break the mirror.",
        "This method is better for wall mirrors that are 2 by 2 ft (0.61 by 0.61 m) or smaller.",
        "The drop cloth will catch any shards of glass that fall if you break your mirror.",
        "Apply packing tape to your mirror to keep it from shattering.",
        "When you\u2019re prying your mirror off of the wall, you may accidentally break the glass.",
        "To keep it from falling everywhere, lay strips of packing tape from each corner to the opposite corner.",
        "Place a horizontal strip bisecting the 2 pieces, and add rows of vertical strips, spaced 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) apart, over the 3 original pieces to provide an additional layer of protection.",
        "If you\u2019re removing tile mirrors, tape each individual tile separately.",
        "Use a heat gun or blow dryer to heat the center of the mirror for 15-30 minutes.",
        "Plug in a heat gun and set it on the lowest setting.",
        "You can use a blow dryer on the highest setting if you don\u2019t have a heat gun.",
        "Hold the blow dryer or heat gun 6\u201312 in (15\u201330 cm) away from the center of your mirror.",
        "Leave it pointed at the mirror for at least 15 minutes to melt the adhesive in the back of the mirror.",
        "If the mirror is bigger than 1 foot (30 cm), you can move your blow dryer or heat gun back and forth to heat the entire mirror, but you should consider using a wire saw if the mirror is big enough that you need to move the heat source.",
        "The blow dryer will take longer to heat the adhesive than the heat gun, so wait at least 30 minutes if you\u2019re using a hair dryer instead.",
        "If you see the mirror move or slide down the wall a little, the glue is already melted.",
        "Simply turn the heat off and wait 1 minute for the glue to cool a little.",
        "Then, pull the mirror right off of the wall.",
        "For these weaker adhesives, you won\u2019t need a putty knife to remove the mirror.",
        "Use a putty knife to pry a corner up and pull the mirror off.",
        "After at least 15 minutes of heat, take a putty knife and place your nondominant hand under the mirror.",
        "Slide the putty knife\u2019s blade in between your mirror and the drywall at one of the corners at the bottom.",
        "Once the blade is in between the wall and the mirror, pull the handle lightly towards you to pressure the mirror off of the wall.",
        "Catch it from falling with your nondominant hand.",
        "If the mirror isn\u2019t sliding off of the wall, the adhesive is likely pretty strong.",
        "You\u2019ll need to use a putty knife to pry these mirrors off.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t need to pull very hard to get the mirror to lift up.",
        "If you feel a lot of resistance, put the putty knife away and keep heating the mirror until the adhesive melts.",
        "If the mirror doesn\u2019t move when you try prying it, do not apply more force.",
        "You\u2019ll just end up cracking the mirror in half.",
        "Either grab or a wire saw or heat it for an additional 15 minutes before trying again."
