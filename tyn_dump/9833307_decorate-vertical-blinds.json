If you want to add a subtle touch to the blinds, consider using a color that is either a few shades lighter or darker than the wall color. For a dash of style, opt for a fun pattern to spice up the window. Choose a polished or natural wood cornice to create a neutral feel. Opt for an outside mount wood cornice as these styles have enough space between the window frame and cornice board. Measure and cut the boards for the cornice. Use a measuring tape to measure the width of the window for the front board and two side board pieces. For the front board, measure from one outside edge of the trim to the other and add 4 in (10 cm). Measure and cut 2 side pieces 5 in (13 cm) each. Measure and cut 2 wood blocks. Each block should be 5 in (13 cm) by 3.5 in (8.9 cm) each. These blocks will be used to hang the board on the wall. Attach the two side pieces to the front board using a screwdriver and screws. Align the 5 in (13 cm) side of one of the side pieces under the end of the front board. Drill a pilot hole through the corner of the front board into the top of the side piece. Repeat this with the other side piece on the opposite side of the front board. Drill pilot holes in each corner of the front board into the side pieces.

Measure the batting and fabric so there is extra left over on either side of both of the side pieces. Iron the fabric before attaching it to the board. Place the fabric face down on a flat surface. Lay the batting on top aligning the edges to the fabric. Place the board front side down on the batting and fabric, keeping in mind the pattern on the front side of the fabric is centered. Wrap the front of the board using a staple gun. Fold the fabric over the top of the board and staple in the middle, pulling the fabric taught. Keep pulling the fabric over the top and stapling every 1 in (2.5 cm) until the top of board is all stapled. Fold the fabric over the bottom of the board, staple in the middle, and then every 1 in (2.5 cm). Make sure the fabric is taught on the front of the board and the pattern is aligned. Wrap the sides pieces with the batting and fabric. Fold the end of the fabric around the corner of the right side of the right side piece and staple to the back of piece, pulling taught. Repeat this step with the left side piece. Fold the top and bottom of the fabric over the top and bottom of the side pieces and staple. Cut away extra fabric around the edges. Use the extra fabric to cover the inside of the side pieces. Use a hot glue gun to attach the extra fabric to the inside of both side pieces so the wood is not showing. If you have enough extra fabric, you can choose to cover the inside of the front board. However, this is not necessary because you won\u2019t be able to see this side once it\u2019s hung.
