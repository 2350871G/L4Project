For example, if you have peeling paint in the bathroom, the extreme temperatures and humidity can cause peeling. Consider using a dehumidifier in that room. If the exterior paint is peeling, check around your gutters or roof to see if they're leaking onto the painted walls. If the walls near the kitchen or bathroom are peeling, you may need to see if the pipes are leaking."

You might even see areas that have extreme cracking that looks like alligator skin. These signs of damage can be caused by moisture getting under the paint or by painting on a surface that wasn't cleaned or primed well. Using cheap paint or painting second coats before letting the first coat dry can also cause damage."

If the peeled paint is on the main part of a wall, apply painter's tape to the trim. To protect yourself from ingesting old paint, put on a safety mask, glasses, and gloves. The old towel or tarp will catch the old paint and debris that you scrape off of the wall."

You can use a stiff-blade putty knife, wire brush, or paint scraper. Scrape until you don't see any peeling paint on the wall.
