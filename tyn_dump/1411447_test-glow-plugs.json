                    "description": "A multimeter is a black box of electronic circuitry used to test electrical wiring or devices. There is a large dial in the center of the multimeter where you can adjust the settings. The multimeter uses black (negative) and red (positive) leads to test electrical currency and resistance. These leads usually have metal clamps at the end of them. While the multimeter can seem daunting because of its many numbers and dials, you only need to use one setting for this test. Analog meters may apply higher voltage to the circuit than the digital meter, so use them with care. The first reading you get from a digital multimeter may not be accurate, since the current can fluctuate. Digital multimeters have a difficult time measuring current that is constantly changing. Because analog multimeters have a changing display, they can show you the current fluctuations. However, analog multimeters are less accurate overall. It is best to use a digital multimeter for this test. A digital multimeter shows the exact number result of the test. An analog multimeter is harder to read because every possible result is listed at the top. If you are using an analog multimeter, make sure to choose one with at least 20k ohm/V sensitivity."
