This will add some comfort to your shelter when you lie down. Avoid using fresh green leaves since you may crush the moisture out of them and get your clothes damp. Building an A-Frame Shelter Set up 2 sturdy branches to form an \u201cA\u201d shape. Use branches that are at least 1 \u20442\u20132 feet (0.46\u20130.61 m) in length. Stand them on end and lean them together so their tops meet. Use grass, rope, or your shoelaces to tie them together so the tops form a small \"V.\"\nYou could also find tall logs to use.

Avoid using any fresh green leaves since these could easily transfer moisture to your body. Lean solid branches on each side of the long stick to form a ribcage. Lay the branches on each side of the shelter so they are at a 45-degree angle to the main branch. Break or cut any branches that extend past the long branch so your shelter is compact. Fill in all the cracks between the branches as best as you can. Use smaller branches to cover any holes or cracks and to prevent debris from falling through. Place dead branches and leaves on top of the ribcage. Start from the bottom of the structure and layer the debris onto the framework you made. The thicker you make your insulation, the warmer you\u2019ll stay and the more camouflaged you\u2019ll be. Aim to layer the leaves at least 2 ft (0.61 m) thick. Cover the opening of your A-frame with more sticks if you want to completely close your shelter when you\u2019re sleeping or away. Making a Teepee Prop 3 long branches against each other to form a tripod frame. Use branches that are the same length so they\u2019re easier to manage. Tie one end of the branches together with plant fiber, rope, shoelaces, or a belt before standing them upright. Set the branches so they are equal distances apart. The size of the branches depends on how many people you want to fit inside. At the very least, spread the 3 branches far enough apart for you to comfortably lay down. Lean the branches in a circle against a tree trunk if you want extra support. Lean more branches of the same length against the tripod frame. Find more branches that are similar in length to surround the rest of the teepee. When you place one branch, go to the opposite side of the teepee and place another branch so your teepee stays balanced. Remember to leave a gap on one side so you can get in and out of your shelter. Fill in cracks with smaller branches. Once you have the main structure built, look for any cracks or holes in the frame of your teepee. Use smaller and thinner sticks to fill them in so wind and rain doesn\u2019t get inside of your shelter. Try to cover as many of the cracks as you can. Cover the outside with leafy branches for insulation. Use sturdy branches that have leaves on them to add extra insulation to your teepee. Lean them evenly across the teepee so it is insulated as much as possible. Dead leaves and debris will blow away in strong winds unless you use more branches to hold them in place.",
