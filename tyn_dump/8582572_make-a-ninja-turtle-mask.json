What color you pick depends on what turtle you want to be:\nDonatello = purple\nLeonardo = blue\nMichelangelo = orange\nRaphael = red Cut a long strip out of the fabric.

If this is for an adult, start with a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide strip. If this is for a child. start with a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strip. Figure out the eye placement. There are two ways you can do this. You can measure the distance between your eyes, and make marks on the mask. You can also drape the mask across your face, and make marks over your eyes with a pen.
