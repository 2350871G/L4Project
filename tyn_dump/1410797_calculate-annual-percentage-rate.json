        "If you spend $500 on your credit card but pay off the entire balance by the due date, APR is not calculated on your money.",
        "To avoid paying interest and to better your overall FICO credit score, make monthly payments on time and in full.",
        "Calculating APR for Credit Cards Divide your finance charges by the total balance, then multiply by 1200 to get your APR.",
        "APR, or annual percentage rate, is the amount of money your bank charges you when it lends you money.",
        "Unless your APR is 0%, you're actually paying extra money every time you leave a balance on your credit card.",
        "Finding out your APR is simple if you follow this formula:\nFinanceChargesCurrentBalance\u221712months\u2217100=APR%{\\displaystyle {\\frac {FinanceCharges}{CurrentBalance}}*12months*100=APR\\%}\nYou should end up with a decimal before multiplying by 100.",
        "This final step converts the decimal into a percentage, making it easier to read.",
        "Find the current balance on your card using the most recent statement.",
        "If your card statement does not tell you your APR, you can calculate it right off your statement sheet.",
        "For an example, assume your current balance is $2,500.",
        "This does not have be the current month's charges only.",
        "APR is calculated on your entire balance, so just use that number.",
        "Find the finance charge on your card using the most recent statement.",
        "For this example, assume that your hypothetical credit statement says that your finance charge is $25 on the $2,500 debt.",
        "This charge will change from month to month.",
        "Divide your finance charge by the amount owed.",
        "The finance charge is leveraged against you depending on your total debt.",
        "$25$2,500=0.01{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\$25}{\\$2,500}}=0.01} Multiply the answer by 100 to get a percent.",
        "This is your finance charge, or interest charged monthly.",
        "0.01\u2217100=1%{\\displaystyle 0.01*100=1\\%} Multiply the monthly charge by 12.",
        "The answer is your annual interest (percentage) rate, also known as \"APR.\"",
        "You can do this with every single bill if you have a variable APR, meaning your bank has the ability to change your interest rates on the fly.",
        "1%\u221712={\\displaystyle 1\\%*12=}12%{\\displaystyle 12\\%} Calculating APR for Mortgage Loans Locate an APR calculator online.",
        "Type is \"APR mortgage calculator\" in a search engine and click on a result.",
        "This is a very complicated equation, and it is difficult to find by hand.",
        "You are much better off using a specialized computer algorithm, and there are plenty of free ones available.",
        "You should see boxes for the following:\nPrincipal, or Loan\nTerm or Length\nInterest\nFees (Optional) Enter the loan amount where indicated on the calculator.",
        "For this example, assume you are taking out a $300,000 mortgage loan.",
        "Mortgages are simply specific loans on houses.",
        "Enter the extra costs of securing the loan (fees) where indicated on the calculator.",
        "For this example, assume it costs $750 extra in fees.",
        "If you're just planning potential mortgages, you might not have fee information yet.",
        "This is fine to leave out -- it won't make an enormous difference on the final calculation.",
        "Enter the given interest rate, which represents the interest rate per year without the additional fees.",
        "For this example, calculate based on a 6.25% interest rate.",
        "Enter the life, or term, of the loan.",
        "Most mortgages are based on the 30-year fixed.",
        "You may have to convert this to months, however.",
        "This is easily done by multiplying the number of years by twelve.",
        "Hit the \"calculate\" button to get the APR.",
        "This is different from the interest rate, as APR represents the real cost of the loan based on the total amount borrowed, not just the current interest rate.",
        "For the hypothetical mortgage provided ($300,000, $750 in fees, 6.25% interest, 360-month term), you should get:\nThe APR of our hypothetical mortgage would be 6.37%.",
        "The monthly principal and interest payment would be $1,847.",
        "The total cost of the interest on the mortgage would add up to $364,975, making the total cost of the mortgage a whopping $664,920."
