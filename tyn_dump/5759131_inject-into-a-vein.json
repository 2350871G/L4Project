It\u2019s harder to locate a vein on a person who is dehydrated. If you suspect that the person is dehydrated, ask them to drink 2 to 3 glasses of water before you deliver the injection. Juice, tea, or decaf coffee can also help to rehydrate the person. If the person is severely dehydrated, they may require intravenous fluids. Continue to look for a vein if they\u2019re unable to drink fluids."

Ask the person if they have a preference about which arm you inject into. Then, look at the person\u2019s arm to see if you can spot a vein. If not, you may need to bring it to the surface. When delivering frequent injections, alternate arms every other day to prevent the veins from collapsing. Use extreme caution if you're injecting into the hands or feet. The veins here are often easier to find, but they are also more fragile and can collapse easily. Injecting into these areas can also be quite painful. If the person is diabetic, don't inject into their feet because it's too risky.Warning: Never inject into the neck, head, groin, or wrist! There are major arteries in the neck and groin, which can increase the risk of overdosing, losing a limb, and even dying from an injection."

For injections delivered to the inner elbow, make sure that the tourniquet is tied above the mound of the bicep and not over the bicep itself. The tourniquet must be easy to remove.
