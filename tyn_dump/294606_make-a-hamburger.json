Here are the different methods you can use:\n\nBroiler/grill: Preheat the broiler (upper level grill) to medium heat. Line a broiler pan with foil, for easier cleanup after cooking. Place the burgers in the broiler pan. Broil them for 6-7 minutes on each side or until thoroughly cooked. Frying pan or skillet: Add oil or butter to the pan and fry the burgers well. Be sure to use low heat and a long cook to properly cook the burgers the whole way through. Place the burgers on the barbecue grill. Cook as usual for hamburgers on the barbecue. Bake: Place in the oven on 350\u00baF/180\u00baC for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness. You may like to flip them over halfway, testing doneness regularly."
