Then, lay your stencils over top of the clay, and cut out the pieces using a knife or blade. To assemble the mug, place the bottom of the mug on a flat surface, and stand the body of the mug up along a long side. Wrap the body around the bottom, and use your fingers to smooth out the clay. Scratch the edges with a fork, and wet your clay to fuse together both sides. Do this to attach your handle as well. Finally, bake your mug at  325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes.
