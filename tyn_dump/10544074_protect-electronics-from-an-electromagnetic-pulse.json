While you can use other kinds of boxes, it\u2019s important to have a lid; so shoe boxes are often your best option.

First measure the length of the box, then measure the height. Multiply the height times 2 and then add it to the length. Then add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to determine how long a piece of foil you\u2019ll need to lay down for your first layer. You can measure the box using inches or centimeters, just make sure you use the same unit of measurement consistently throughout the project. As an example, a box that is 10 inches (25 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) high would look like this: 4 inches (10 cm) x 2 = 8 inches (20 cm). 8 inches (20 cm) + 10 inches (25 cm) = 18 inches (46 cm). Then add the extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) for a total of 19 inches (48 cm). The extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) of foil will allow you to fold it over the top edges of the box."

        "Repeat that process on the other side with the last remaining sheet of foil.",
        "The box itself is now completely covered in aluminum foil.",
        "Use long strips of tape to ensure all three sheets of foil are in constant and direct contact with one another.",
        "There should be no gaps in the foil.",
        "Use the shoe box lid to measure out another sheet of foil.",
        "You\u2019ll be able to wrap the box lid with one sheet of aluminum foil.",
        "Stretch the foil out on the table and place the box lid on top of it.",
        "With enough foil rolled out to cover the full lid, use a razor blade or the box teeth to cut that sheet of foil off.",
        "Be careful not to tear the foil as it won\u2019t have overlapping layers like the rest of the box.",
        "Secure the foil to the lid using tape.",
        "Fold the foil around the shape of the lid so it covers the top and sides completely, then use scotch tape to hold it in place.",
        "Fold the foil under the lid so the insides of the lid\u2019s sidewalls are covered in foil as well.",
        "You can add more layers of foil if you tear it or the box lid is too large to be covered in a single sheet.",
        "Place your electronics inside the box and close the lid.",
        "The foil from the lid coming into direct contact with the foil from the box will create a barrier that can redirect the energy released by an EMP around the electronics stored inside the box.",
        "Make sure the foil on the interior sidewalls of the lid is making contact with the exterior of the box\u2019s walls.",
        "You can seal the box closed with aluminum tape for extra protection.",
        "Remember, if you seal the box, you\u2019ll tear the foil when you unseal it.",
        "Using a Bucket Purchase a galvanized metal bucket.",
        "The bucket will serve as the body of the Faraday cage.",
        "Look on the bucket\u2019s label to ensure it is made of galvanized metal.",
        "Base the size of the bucket on what you intend to protect inside your Faraday cage.",
        "This project is commonly done using a 6 US gal (23 L) bucket.",
        "The bucket must be made of galvanized metal for the Faraday cage to work.",
        "Plastic buckets will not redirect the flow of an EMP.",
        "Choose a bucket that has a metal lid.",
        "You can purchase a galvanized metal bucket at your local hardware store.",
        "Line the seams of the bucket with aluminum tape.",
        "Although a galvanized metal bucket is watertight, the seam created in the bucket\u2019s construction could provide enough of a gap to allow energy to flow through in the event of an EMP.",
        "Mitigate this by applying aluminum tape to the interior of the bucket along the seam where the metal was joined together.",
        "Your Faraday cage may work without lining the seam with aluminum tape.",
        "Doing so is an additional precaution to ensure there are no gaps in the protection created by the bucket.",
        "You can find aluminum tape at your local hardware store.",
        "Add aluminum tape to anywhere handles attach to the bucket or lid.",
        "Even a tiny gap in the metal of the bucket or lid could allow for an EMP to damage electronics stored inside your Faraday cage.",
        "Mitigate that by adding strips of aluminum tape to the inside of the bucket where the handle passes through, as well as on the underside of the lid where its handle attaches.",
        "The holes where a handle passes through into the bucket are the most likely areas for a gap that could compromise your Faraday cage.",
        "These holes may already be covered by the aluminum tape you used on the bucket\u2019s seam.",
        "Line the inside of the bucket with cardboard.",
        "Your electronics need to be separated from the exterior metal by an insulating layer.",
        "You can purchase a smaller rubber or plastic bucket and simply set it inside the galvanized metal bucket, or you can line the interior of the bucket with cardboard.",
        "Use masking tape, rather than aluminum tape, to secure the cardboard in place.",
        "Cut a circle of cardboard out and place it on the bottom of the bucket.",
        "Slide cardboard into the bucket, so it is standing upright, and wrap it around the interior.",
        "When you\u2019re done, the inside walls and the floor of the bucket should be lined in cardboard.",
        "Insert your electronics.",
        "Place your electronics inside the cardboard or bucket you\u2019ve lined the interior of your Faraday cage with.",
        "Then place the lid over the top of the bucket.",
        "The direct metal on metal contact from the lid to the bucket should be enough to make the cage functional, but you can use aluminum tape to seal the bucket shut for added protection.",
        "Test your Faraday cage using radios or your cell phone to ensure it works.",
        "Testing Your Faraday Cage with a Cell Phone Get one cellular phone and a second phone to call it with.",
        "You\u2019ll need two phones to conduct this experiment.",
        "If you have a house phone, you can do it on your own.",
        "Otherwise, you\u2019ll need a friend with a cell phone to assist you with the test.",
        "You\u2019ll need a way to call your cell phone once it\u2019s inside the Faraday cage.",
        "Make sure both cell phones have good service.",
        "Find a location to conduct your test where both phones are receiving a strong cell phone signal so you can be certain that it\u2019s the Faraday cage preventing your phone from receiving a cellular signal, rather than other environmental factors.",
        "It\u2019s best to conduct this experiment somewhere that you have the best possible service your phone is capable of receiving.",
        "Have your friend call your phone as a control.",
        "Set the ringer on your phone to its loudest setting and wait for it to start ringing.",
        "There may be a slight delay, but your phone should start ringing very shortly after your friend calls it.",
        "If your phone doesn\u2019t receive the call, there\u2019s a problem with it and you won\u2019t be able to use it to test the Faraday cage.",
        "If the phone rings, hang up the call.",
        "Place your phone inside the Faraday cage.",
        "Open the lid on the Faraday cage you constructed and set the phone down inside.",
        "Replace the lid and make sure it\u2019s coming in direct contact with the box or bucket all the way around.",
        "The phone should not be coming into contact with any metal or foil inside the Faraday cage.",
        "Ask your friend to dial your number again.",
        "This time, you should not hear your phone ringing from inside the Faraday cage.",
        "If the phone does not ring, your Faraday cage has successfully redirected the signal around its exterior and prevented it from reaching your phone.",
        "If your phone does ring, it means there\u2019s a gap somewhere in the Faraday cage that is allowing the signal to pass through.",
        "Test your cage more than once to ensure it works.",
        "Look for gaps in your Faraday cage if the call gets through.",
        "Any gap in the exterior metal of your Faraday cage could potentially allow an electronic pulse to pass through.",
        "Look your Faraday cage over and cover any gaps you spot with aluminum foil or tape.",
        "Then test the Faraday cage again.",
        "This test does not guarantee that your Faraday cage will work, but it offers the easiest way to assess any potential signal leaks.",
        "Repeat the test and keep covering gaps until the signal no longer passes through the Faraday cage."
