    "text": " Attaching D-Rings to a Frame Put the frame face down on a flat work surface with the bottom nearest to you. Lay the frame face up in front of you first so you are sure the bottom of the frame is closest to you. Carefully flip it over so you are looking at the back side. This will ensure the picture frame is oriented correctly as you install the D-rings. Put a sticky felt bump in each of the bottom corners of the picture frame.

You can get sticky felt bumps at a craft supply shop, hardware store, or online. They are just small circular pieces of felt with an adhesive on the back that you peel off a sheet like stickers. Measure and mark 1/3 of the way down from the top of the frame. Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure 1/3 of the way down from the top on 1 side and make a mark with a pencil. Repeat this on the other side. For example, if the picture frame is 30 cm (12 in) long, make a mark on each side 10 cm (3.9 in) down from the top of the frame. Screw a D-ring into each side where you made the marks. Lay the D-rings so the screw holes line up with your marks and the D shapes face inwards towards the center of the frame.

Note that this will only work for wooden frames or frames made out of other pliable materials that you can screw into. It will not work for metal frames. Tying on the Wire and Hanging the Frame Select the correct weight of wire for the size of frame you want to hang. Picture frame wire comes in different sizes that can support different weights. Choose a gauge of wire that can support at least the weight of the frame you want to hang. For example, if the frame you want to hang weighs 13 lb (5.9 kg), you could use 15 lb (6.8 kg) picture frame wire. Cut a piece of wire to 10 cm (3.9 in) longer than the width of the frame. Measure the width of the picture frame with a ruler or measuring tape and add 10 cm (3.9 in) to the width. Measure out the wire to this length and clip it with pliers. This will allow you to tie and secure the wire in place while still leaving a little slack for hanging the frame. Tie the ends of the wires to the D-rings using slipknots. Insert the end of 1 wire up through the D-ring on 1 side, fold about 2\u20133 cm (0.79\u20131.18 in) of the wire back and loop it around the long part of the wire once, then slip it back down through the D-ring to create a slipknot.
