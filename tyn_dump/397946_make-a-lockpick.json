Paperclip Pick and Tension Wrench Straighten out the outermost bend of the paperclip. Use your fingers to flatten out the outside curve of the paperclip.

Use metal paperclips that are at least 4 cm (1.6 in) long (before altering them) to make both the pick and the tension wrench. Shorter clips won\u2019t be able to access the lock\u2019s inner workings, and plastic paperclips will simply break. Twist the inner end of the clip around the section next to it, using pliers.
