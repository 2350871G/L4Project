The pan flute, or pan pipe, is a type of flute consisting of a group of small pipes of graduated length to produce a melody. Pan flutes are usually made of wood, but many other materials can be used. A very basic pan flute can be built out of drinking straws. Gather eight straws (you can use more or fewer as convenient).  Leave one straw uncut, then use a scissors to cut an inch off the second straw, so that each straw is an inch shorter than the previous one.  Tear or cut a length of tape sufficient to wrap around the straws.  Lay the straws side by side on the tape and fold the tape around the straws. If you wish, you can decorate the tape with markers or crayons either before or after you secure the straws. Play the pan flute by blowing across the top of the straws.  Creating a Pan Flute With Bottles Gather and wash the bottles you want to use. You can use as many bottles as you want, and any material, but at least six are recommended. Blow a note on each bottle to determine their pitch. You can raise the pitch by adding water to the bottle. Arrange the bottles according to pitch.  Start playing.  Creating a Cardboard Tube Flute Try cardboard for a simple tube flute. You can create a simple flute using a small-diameter cardboard such as a paper towel or empty wrapping paper roll. Since making a cardboard flute requires the use of sharp objects like craft knives and scissors, young children should be supervised by an adult if they will be handling these tools. Cut the tube to the desired length. The Music Revitalization Project, an organization dedicated to keep concert band music alive, recommends a length of no more than two feet. Using scissors or a craft knife, cut an oval hole approximately two inches from the end of the tube about one-half to one inch to create a sound hole (embouchure).  Plug the end closest to the sound hole using modeling clay or any other medium that closes the end completely.  Cut six holes down the length of the tube at even intervals. Make sure the holes are not bigger than your fingertips. Decorate the flute with crayons, markers, or any other medium. If you use paint, allow it to dry at least overnight.
