The nails are usually a brown-white marble colour, and for beginners, you'll usually need 3 of them, including the special one for the thumb. Get the tape. The tape comes in many colours and is used to stick the nails to the fingers. You'll need about 6\u20138 centimeter (2\u20133 in) of tape for each nail. Stick one end of the tape to the nail. Put the nail before your first joint on your finger and wrap the tape around the finger. Test the nail on the guzheng to see if it works. Simply pluck a string. Use the above steps for the middle and index fingers. For the thumb, follow the same steps, except you should turn the nail at a 45-degree angle to the right."

                    "description": "When plucking the strings, you shouldn't use your wrist to give you strength, but instead, you should use your fingers to give you the strength to pluck the strings. Practice moving your fingers into a curve, then back up. These are the basic techniques for plucking:\nTo pluck the string with your thumb, position your thumb at a place where it will be able to make a sound out of the string. If you put on your nail correctly, the thumb should be able to pluck the string. The name for the thumb's plucking is \"tuo\". In music, its symbol is a shape of a right angle. To pluck the string with your index finger, tuck all the other fingers in your palm. Use your index finger to pluck the string, and during that, quickly move it so it aligns with the other fingers in the palm. The name for the index finger's plucking is \"mo\". Its symbol is a slash. Pluck the string with your middle finger. Do the same as you would with the index finger, except use the middle finger. The name for the middle finger is \"gou\". Its symbol is a rainbow-like shape. Try using your ring finger to pluck. Only do this when you have mastered the other 3. Pluck it the same way as your index finger. This is called \"da\". It is represented by a mountain-like structure. During, before, and after plucking, your other fingers should be curved in your hand.Tip: When plucking and playing songs, make sure you position your hand to the right of the guzheng. This will create the best sound."

If the machine flashes a green light, you can move onto the next note. If it flashes a red light, figure out what to do.

Since it requires more technique to play F on the guzheng, it's best if you don't try as a beginner. Learning plucking and getting basic knowledge of the strings are the top priorities. Learning More Advanced Techniques Try doing a glissando. A glissando is when you simply start at one string then move the hand to pluck every single string until you stop at another string. It is similar to the piano glissando. When doing a glissando with your thumb, shift the other parts of your hand forward. Try plucking away from your palm. This is the opposite of basic plucking. This takes practice, but the result is worth it! Start by doing this with your thumb, then move on to other fingers. This can be done by any finger, though it is almost never done by the pinky.
