Work to push out any air bubbles that may be trapped beneath the film and create a tight seal over the crack.Make sure there aren\u2019t any creases or bubbles in the film. Filling the Crack with Resin Fill the syringe with the epoxy resin adhesive. The epoxy resin adhesive comes with a plastic syringe.
