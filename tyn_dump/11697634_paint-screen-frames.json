But if the frames are too high to reach safely, place a ladder up against the wall of your home and have someone stand at the bottom to keep it steady. You may need a small stepladder to reach the top of some screen frames on the ground floor. Use a ladder with an attachable tray to prop your supplies on so you\u2019re not carrying everything at once. If you\u2019re painting screen frames indoors, set down a drop cloth beneath them so you don\u2019t get paint or primer on the floor."

Press up on the upper section of the screen frame and lift the bottom portion out to the front or back to remove it. Most screen frames can easily pop out, but if they don't, it might be best to leave them installed.

Rinse the sponge or rag in the water every few swipes to clean it so you're not spreading around dirty water. It\u2019s okay to just use a damp rag and skip the soap, if desired.

It's not necessary to remove all of the paint if your frame is made of metal, but sanding off as much old paint as possible on a wooden frame is a good idea.
