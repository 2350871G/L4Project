Set the bag on a white or black tabletop and place a white or black background behind it. For example, if the bag is white, choose a plain black background so the bag will really pop. If you do want a creative background, choose a single color with texture. You could place the bag in front of wood, stone, or brick."

Secure the wire or line to your background to prevent the handles from falling down. Keep the handles level when you straighten them up."

The stuffing will also prevent the bag from slumping over which will make it tricky to photograph. Avoid overstuffing the bag or it will look rigid and unnatural."

Use a can of compressed air to spray away any debris that could show up on the photograph. Compressed air is great for leather handbags since it won't scratch the material."

Tighten the legs of the tripod so they're secure and attach your camera to the top of the tripod. If you're using a phone camera, secure the phone to a small adjustable tripod.
