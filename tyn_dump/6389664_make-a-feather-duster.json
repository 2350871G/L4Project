If you choose 2 to 3 thin sticks, hold them together in one hand and squeeze some glue between them and leave to cool down and dry which will take about 10 - 15 minutes. Cut a long piece of yarn and tie it onto one end of the bamboo handle and add a bit of glue to secure the knot.  Wrap the yarn tightly around the bamboo handle until you reach the other end.  Secure the end of the yarn with a knot and a bit of the glue.  Create a padded base for the handle by wrapping either foam padding or sheep fleece around the bamboo.  Cut a long piece of yarn and tie it to one end of the bamboo and add a bit of glue to secure the knot.  Wrap the yarn around the padding or fleece. Tie with a knot at the other end and secure with a bit of glue. The padded base of the handle will provide more surface area to attach the quills and will help to protect the walls and furniture from scratches. Gather the feathers. Take dyed feathers of either ostrich or turkey or in a single shade or in different colours to give an eye-catching look to the duster. Choose which end of the bamboo handle you would like to put the feathers.  Put the glue along the quill of the feather and attach around the base of the padded handle.  Build up as many layers of feathers around the base of the handle as you wish. Leave it to dry for about 10-15 minutes to ensure that the glue has cooled down. Take a long piece of yarn and tie to the part of the handle that meets the tip of the quills. Secure it with a bit of glue. Wrap the yarn around the quill tips ending at the part of the handle where you began to glue the quills.  Tie in a knot and secure with a bit of glue. By wrapping the thread around the base of the handle and quills you be able to hide all the quill ends and it will give the duster a more professional look.",
