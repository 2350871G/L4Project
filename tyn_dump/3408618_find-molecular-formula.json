The empirical formula provides the simplest, most reduced ratio of elements within a molecule, for example, two oxygens for every carbon. The molecular formula tells you how many of each of those atoms is present in the molecule. For example, one carbon and two oxygens (carbon dioxide). The two formulae are related by a whole number ratio such that if the empirical formula is multiplied by the ratio, it will yield the molecular formula. Calculate the number of moles of gas. This means utilizing the ideal gas law. You can determine the number of moles based on the pressure, volume, and temperature provided by the experimental data. The number of moles can be calculated using the following formula: n = PV/RT. In this formula, n is the number of moles, P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and R is the gas constant. Example: n = PV/RT = (0.984 atm * 1 L) / (0.08206 L atm mol-1 K-1 *  318.15 K) = 0.0377 mol Calculate the molecular weight of the gas. This can only be done after finding the moles of gas present using the ideal gas law. You will also need to know how many grams of gas were present. Then divide the grams of gas by the moles of gas present to yield molecular weight. Example: 14.42 g / 0.0377 mol = 382.49 g/mol Add together the atomic weight of all atoms in the empirical formula. Each atom in the empirical formula has its own atomic weight. This value can be found at the bottom of the atom\u2019s square on the periodic table.

In doing this, you can determine how many times the empirical weight is repeated within the actual molecule. Knowing how many times the empirical weight is repeated will let you find the number of times that the empirical formula repeats itself in the molecular formula. This should be a whole number. If the ratio is not a whole number, you will have to round it. Example: 382.49 / 190.366 = 2.009 Multiply the empirical formula by the ratio. Multiply the subscripts of the empirical formula by the ratio. This will yield the molecular formula. Note that for any compound with a ratio of \u201c1,\u201d the empirical formula and molecular formula will be the same. Example: C12OH30 * 2 = C24O2H60 Finding the Empirical Formula Find the mass of each atom present. Sometimes the mass of each atom will be given. Other times, it will be given as a percent mass. If this is the case, assume a 100 g sample of the compound. This will allow you to write the percent mass as an actual mass in grams. Example: 75.46 g C, 8.43 g O, 16.11 g H Convert the masses to moles. You need to convert the molecular masses of each element to moles. In order to do this, you need to divide the molecular masses by the atomic masses of each respective element.

You need to divide the number of moles for each separate element by the smallest molar amount from all the elements present in the compound. In doing so, you can find the simplest mole ratios.
