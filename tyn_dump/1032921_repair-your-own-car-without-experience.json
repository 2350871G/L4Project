Replace the cap on the distributor assembly. Put the cap back in the engine compartment, making sure it is in the same position the old cap was in before you removed it. The spark plug cords need to be tucked neatly into the compartment, inspect them to ensure they aren\u2019t coiled or bunched up at all. When you\u2019re ready, secure the cap with any clips or screws you undid earlier. If the spark plugs are bent or otherwise obstructed, your car\u2019s systems may not get adequate power. Start the vehicle to see if it runs smoothly. Misfires or backfires are a sign that the cap and rotor aren\u2019t positioned correctly. Shut down the car so you can take another look at them. Installing a New Fuel Filter Locate the fuel filter near the fuel tank. There are 2 different places the fuel filter can be, so you may need to do a little searching. The most common location is underneath the car, right next to the fuel tank. In some vehicles, the fuel filter is in the engine compartment. Open the hood and see if you can spot it underneath the dashboard. The fuel filter is a round canister with 2 spokes sticking out the sides. The car\u2019s fuel line hoses connect to the spokes. The canister itself is often black, gray, or orange. Refer to your owner\u2019s manual! With it, you can pinpoint the filter\u2019s location right away. A slow or stalled car may indicate a dirty fuel filter. Replace it to see if this brings your car back up to speed. Remove the fuel pump fuse from the fuse box. Turn the car off and locate the fuse box underneath the engine\u2019s hood. It looks like a big, rectangular case and is usually labeled. Pull off the top, then look at the diagram printed on it. It will tell you the location of the fuse you need, which you can remove simply by pulling it out of the box with pliers. Your car needs to be turned off to do this. The fuses conduct electricity, so never touch the box while your car is live. Start the car\u2019s engine to relieve pressure in the fuel line. Set the car in park to ensure it can\u2019t move while you work on it. Then, loosen the gas cap and start the car. Let it run for about a minute to drive out the air in the line. Afterwards, turn off the car and replace the fuse. You only need to let the car run for 1 or 2 minutes. You should be able to hear the air hissing out from the gas cap near the back of the car. Lift the car with a jack if the filter is underneath it. Use the owner\u2019s manual to find the jack points, which are usually right behind the wheels. Pump the jack to raise the car, then slide jack stands underneath it for additional security. For safety, park the car on a hard, flat surface before lifting it. The jack stands catch the car in case something happens to the jack. Always place a stand next to a jack to reduce the risk of accidents. Place a container underneath the filter to catch leaking fluid. Any fuel left in the line will leak out as soon as you detach it from the filter. Keep a bowl, bucket, or another container on hand. You may also benefit from wearing gloves to keep the gasoline off of your hands. The fuel needs to be kept in a separate container from other fluids like oil. When you\u2019re done with it, drop it off at a recycling location. Most mechanic shops accept fuel for recycling. Unscrew the fuel line bolts from the fuel filter. The bolts hold the fuel lines secure to the filter. If your filter has them, they will be right where the lines connect to the filter\u2019s spokes. Turn the bolts counterclockwise to remove them. Then, pull the lines until they pop off the filter. Some fuel filters use clips instead of bolts, which you can undo by pulling on them with your fingers. If the fuel lines are hard to remove, try twisting them off with a wrench. Replace the filter and connect it to the fuel lines. Take off the old filter, then slide the other one into the bracket hanging from the car. Make sure you position the new filter the same way the old one was. Then, push the fuel lines onto the filter\u2019s spokes and replace any bolts or clips used to hold them in place. To help you install them correctly, most filters have flow lines printed on them. Use the lines to orient the old and new filter before swapping them. The flow line should point towards the car\u2019s engine. Start the car\u2019s engine and check for leaks. Lower the car down off the jacks, also remembering to return the fuel pump fuse to the fuse box if you haven\u2019t already. Let the car run for a minute, then check underneath it. If you see leaking fuel, stop the car. Check the fuel lines and filter to make sure they are correctly positioned and tightly connected. Replacing an Air Filter Locate the air filter case beneath the hood. The air filter will be a large black case in the engine compartment. It\u2019s usually on the left side of the compartment, right behind the car\u2019s lights. The case will be labeled with an emblem that resembles an arrow passing through a screen. The filter is typically pretty easy to find, but refer to the owner\u2019s manual if you need help tracking it down. Unscrew the case to access the air filter. Look around the rim of the case to find out what holds it in place. Depending on your car, expect to see about 3 screws or clips. If your filter case has screws on it, get a hex-head screwdriver and twist the screws counterclockwise to remove them. For clips, simply pull them back to release the cover. Lift the filter out of the casing. The filter is the only thing in the casing, so you can\u2019t miss it. It\u2019s the plastic rectangle with the strips of typically white filter material inside it. Depending on your filter, it may be red or orange. All you have to do is grasp the plastic edge and lift it to pop it out of the vehicle. An old filter will look dirty. If you try to shine a light through the filter material, you won\u2019t be able to see it on the other side. Replace the filter when this happens to keep harmful debris out of your car. Install the new filter after wiping down the chamber. Get a clean rag and carefully wipe up any dirt left underneath the filter. Try to prevent it from falling further down into the filter compartment. Then, lay the new filter in place. The end with the exposed filter material should hang down into the compartment. Use your old filter as reference for the new one. Check how it was placed in the compartment so you know exactly how to fit the new one. Replace the case cover and screws. Fit the case cover back together, then begin securing it in place. If your case has clips, snap them back in place. For screws, place the screws back in the holes on the case\u2019s edges, then turn them clockwise to tighten them. You won\u2019t need to test the filter to see if it is working. As long as it fits securely in the chamber, it will work.",
