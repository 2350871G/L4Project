For example, use your right hand if you are left-handed. Hold a pen or pencil in your dominant hand and use it to trace around your other hand. Keep the pen or pencil close to your skin as you trace. Go around every finger as well as the sides of your hand. If you want to create fingerless gloves, trace only to the point on your fingers that you want the gloves to go. Then, add an extra \u20442 in (1.3 cm) to the end of each finger for seam allowance."
