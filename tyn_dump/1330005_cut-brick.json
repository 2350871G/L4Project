Just be aware that you're more likely to create a messy or jagged break using this method. Use a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide cold chisel and hammer to remove jagged edges. Another alternative is a stone carving file. When using a file, stroke outward along the brick away from you. Afterward, lift the file, bring it back toward you, and repeat the process until the jagged edges are smooth."
