Garnet is a natural abrasive used for sanding any kind of bare wood. Garnet is versatile, but it dulls faster than other sandpapers. Silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is best used for sanding down joint compound (the thick mix used to plaster over seams in drywall) and getting out specks of dust that get trapped under your wood finish. Aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide can be used to sand down wood, metal, and paint. It\u2019s duller than silicon carbide, but it lasts longer. Ceramic.

Fine-grade sandpaper has a grit of 180 to 220. A 220-grit sandpaper should be fine enough for your project, but there are higher grits if you want a smoother finish."
