You may want to avoid polyester or nylon thread if your finished item will require high-heat pressing. These types of thread will melt under higher temperatures. Mid-weight polyester or nylon thread works best for knit garments since it will stretch with the fabric. This type of thread is also great for winding a bobbin since it glides easily. Polyester thread is also available in cones for use with sergers, which are heavy-duty sewing machines that create overlock (made up of 3-4 stitches) stitches to bind fabric together.Tip: Match the thread material with the item\u2019s fabric whenever possible. For example, if you\u2019re sewing a wool item, use wool thread. If you\u2019re sewing cotton, use cotton thread. If you\u2019re sewing silk, go with cotton thread."
