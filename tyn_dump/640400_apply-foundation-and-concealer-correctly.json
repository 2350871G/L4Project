        "Moisturize your face.",
        "This will protect your skin and make the makeup appear more natural.",
        "If the moisturizer doesn't include sun protection, apply sunscreen as well.",
        "Optionally, apply foundation primer over the moisturizer.",
        "This is most helpful for people with oily skin, to create a smooth base for the foundation and it will also help your makeup to last longer.",
        "Apply color-correcting concealer if needed.",
        "If you're covering dark eye circles, port wine birthmarks, or other colorful areas, apply the color-correcting concealer of the opposite color on the color wheel.",
        "Blend this in, but don't expect it to disappear; the foundation and the skin tone concealer will hide it.",
        "When applying to the eye, tap the concealer on, working from the outside of the eye inward to the nose.",
        "You only need to apply it to the darkest area, then dab upward in a sweeping motion to thinly cover the rest.",
        "This is the most difficult type of concealer to use.",
        "Practice with different amounts and shades until it works out.",
        "Sweep the foundation across your face.",
        "Use a makeup sponge, your fingertips, or (for liquid foundation only) a foundation brush.",
        "Brush across your entire face and blend until the foundation is evenly applied, taking care not to wipe away too much of the color-correcting concealer.",
        "A stippling brush works well for blending.",
        "If using liquid foundation, warm the container in your hand before applying.",
        "Although many makeup users apply concealer first, this wastes time and product when the foundation sweeps away some of the concealer.",
        "The exception is powder foundation, which should be applied over the concealer.",
        "Make adjustments.",
        "Check your jawline, where poor blending is most visible.",
        "If you see a line, extend your foundation a bit below the jawline and blend it into your neckline.",
        "This will help to give your makeup a more unified look.",
        "If the foundation looks too thick or caked on in any location, tap it with a bare powder puff.",
        "All you need is a thin layer.",
        "Conceal other blemishes or dark spots.",
        "You may apply concealer to your entire face if desired, but in most cases all you need to do is cover areas of uneven tone, acne, and other blemishes.",
        "Dab gently with a finger, concealer brush, or sponge until you cannot see the break between concealer and the surrounding skin.",
        "Dust your face lightly with a translucent powder.",
        "Do this immediately after applying your concealer to provide a nice matte finish and hold the makeup in place.",
        "You may want to skip this step if your face is feeling extra dry, as powders can absorb moisture.",
        "Apply other makeup if desired.",
        "Once the concealer and foundation are as blended as possible, you're ready to rock a natural look, or use it as a base for highlighting, contouring, and so forth.",
        "Whichever you choose, enjoy your even, blemish-free look."
