If you plan on painting several bobby pins the same color, consider separating them into small groups based on the color you will be painting them. If you want to create a \"color blocked\" look, get some black bobby pins, and lay down strips of tape over them at various angles. Paint the top of your bobby pins using a single stroke. Don't worry if the nail polish looks see-though in places; you can always add another coat or two. You can paint either the flat side or the bumpy side\u2014whichever one you plan on wearing on top!

You may notice bits of paper or excess nail polish sticking to the bobby pins. If this happens, simply scratch the paper/nail polish off with your fingernail. Using Coat Buttons Get a coat button that you find pretty or interesting. The loop or shank on the back of the button needs to be big enough for one of the prongs on the bobby pin to slide through. Turn the bobby pin over so that the side you plan on wearing outward is facing you. Wearing the bumpy side against your head will give you a better grip, but you can wear the bobby pin with the bumpy side facing out. Slip the button over the tip of the bobby pin.

If you used hot glue, your bobby pin will be ready to wear as soon as the glue sets; this usually only takes a few minutes. If you used super glue, this may take a little bit longer. Using Gemstones and Other Findings Slid your bobby pin(s) partway onto an index card. Leave about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) sticking out over the edge. This way, you won't risk accidentally gluing your bobby pin to the paper. The paper will help keep the bobby pin from rolling around while the glue dries. If you can't find and index card, a piece of cardstock or even ordinary printer paper will do. Make sure that the side you want to decorate is facing up. The flat side of the bobby pin is technically the top, but many people like to wear bobby pins with the bumpy side facing out. Choose a side to work on, then set your sheet of paper with the bobby pin on it down. Choose something to glue to your bobby pin.

Whatever you choose to use, make sure that it is small or lightweight. A large, fabric flower should not be a problem, but if you are going to use something heavy (like an earring or cabochon), choose something that is \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) or smaller. If you are using a vintage earring, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the  post off. Create your own design! Glue a cabochon to a filigree button, or glue a few beads together to make a flower. Place a drop of glue onto the back of the gem. The best glue to use for this would be an industrial-strength glue, super glue, or epoxy glue. Ordinary craft glue is not recommended, because it is not strong enough. Hot glue may work in a pinch, but your gemstone may break off. Press the gemstone onto the bobby pin. It would be best if you pres it against the flat/bumpy side, and not the curved/looped part of the bobby pin. This way, your gemstone will be less likely to fall off. If you really want to, however, you can glue your decoration to the very tip, but be aware that it may break off. Wait for the glue to dry.

If the gemstone you added is still loose, consider cutting a small scrap of fabric, and then gluing it to the back of the gemstone. This will help anchor the gemstone to the bobby pin. Using Beads and Wire Cut a 10-inch (cc-centimeter) long piece of thin beading wire. Make sure that the wire is thin enough to go through your bead. Slip the wire part-way through the bend in your bobby pin. Bring the wire 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of the way through the looped part of the bobby pin. Twist the wire shut, then snip off the shorter piece of wire. Twist the wire only 2 to 3 times. Next, use a pair of wire cutters to snip the stub off as close to the twists as possible. Thread the wire through your first bead. Move the bead to the bumpy side of the bobby pin.

        "The paper will help keep the bobby pin from rolling around while the glue dries.",
        "If you can't find and index card, a piece of cardstock or even ordinary printer paper will do.",
        "Make sure that the side you want to decorate is facing up.",
        "The flat side of the bobby pin is technically the top, but many people like to wear bobby pins with the bumpy side facing out.",
        "Choose a side to work on, then set your sheet of paper with the bobby pin on it down.",
        "Choose something to glue to your bobby pin.",
        "Gemstones and rhinestones are popular, but you can also use other small items, such as: cabochons, vintage earrings, flat buttons, fabric flowers, and so forth.",
        "Whatever you choose to use, make sure that it is small or lightweight.",
        "A large, fabric flower should not be a problem, but if you are going to use something heavy (like an earring or cabochon), choose something that is \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) or smaller.",
        "If you are using a vintage earring, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the  post off.",
        "Create your own design!",
        "Glue a cabochon to a filigree button, or glue a few beads together to make a flower.",
        "Place a drop of glue onto the back of the gem.",
        "The best glue to use for this would be an industrial-strength glue, super glue, or epoxy glue.",
        "Ordinary craft glue is not recommended, because it is not strong enough.",
        "Hot glue may work in a pinch, but your gemstone may break off.",
        "Press the gemstone onto the bobby pin.",
        "It would be best if you pres it against the flat/bumpy side, and not the curved/looped part of the bobby pin.",
        "This way, your gemstone will be less likely to fall off.",
        "If you really want to, however, you can glue your decoration to the very tip, but be aware that it may break off.",
        "Wait for the glue to dry.",
        "How long you wait will depend on the type of glue you are using.",
        "Super glue may dry in just a few minutes, while an industrial-strength glue may take up to several hours.",
        "Read the label on your glue for specific drying times.",
        "Take the bobby pin off the paper.",
        "At this point, your bobby pin is now ready to wear!",
        "If the gemstone you added is still loose, consider cutting a small scrap of fabric, and then gluing it to the back of the gemstone.",
        "This will help anchor the gemstone to the bobby pin.",
        "Using Beads and Wire Cut a 10-inch (cc-centimeter) long piece of thin beading wire.",
        "Make sure that the wire is thin enough to go through your bead.",
        "Slip the wire part-way through the bend in your bobby pin.",
        "Bring the wire 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of the way through the looped part of the bobby pin.",
        "Twist the wire shut, then snip off the shorter piece of wire.",
        "Twist the wire only 2 to 3 times.",
        "Next, use a pair of wire cutters to snip the stub off as close to the twists as possible.",
        "Thread the wire through your first bead.",
        "Move the bead to the bumpy side of the bobby pin.",
        "This is technically the underside of the bobby pin, but the grooves will give the beads and the wires something to hold on to.",
        "Wrap the wire around the bumpy part of the bobby pin.",
        "You may have to push the bobby pin open so that you can get the wire between the two prongs.",
        "Do not wrap the wire around both prongs, or you won't be able to use the bobby pin.",
        "The bead may start to shift as you wrap the wire.",
        "If this starts to happen, use your fingers to hold the bead in place.",
        "Thread another bead onto the wire, and wrap it through the bobby pin again.",
        "Give the wire a gentle tug first, then thread the bead onto it.",
        "Hold the bead in place as you wrap the bead through the bobby pin once more.",
        "Keep adding beads and wrapping the wire until you are one bead's width from the end of the bobby in.",
        "How many beads you use will depend on the side of your bobby pin as well as the size of the beads.",
        "The smaller the beads are, the more beads you will need.",
        "The beads can be different colors, but they should all be the same shape and size.",
        "Wrap the wire a few times around the tip of the bobby pin without adding any beads.",
        "Wrap the wire about three times, as tightly as you can.",
        "This will seal your beadwork shut.",
        "Pass the wire back through or under 2 to 3 beads, then snip it off.",
        "If the beads have large enough holes, you can wrap the wire back through the beads and under the bobby pin prong.",
        "If the holes are too small, simply pull the wire under three beads (keep it between the beads and the top of the bobby pin).",
        "Snip the excess wire off with a pair of wire cutters.",
        "For added security, add a drop of glue under the wrapped wire at the tip of your bobby pin.",
        "Use jewelry glue; it dries clear and is suitable for metal."
