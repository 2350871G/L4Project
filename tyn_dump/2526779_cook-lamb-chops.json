Let the onions cook on low heat until they begin to caramelize and wilt. They should turn a nice golden-brown color around the edges. Add \u20442  c (120 mL) of lamb or beef broth to the pan. Stir as you pour in the broth, scraping the bottom of the pan as you go. Heat to a boil and allow the juices to thicken slightly. Additionally, pour in any juices that have accumulated on the plate that the lamb chops are resting on for added flavor. If you would prefer thicker gravy, add a slurry of 1 tbsp (7.5 g) of cornstarch and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of cold water. Heat to a boil and continue stirring until the gravy thickens more. Remove the chops from the oven and ladle the gravy over them. Transfer the chops to serving plates before adding the gravy. Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs, if desired. This dish pairs well with potatoes and vegetables! Roasting Lamb Chops in the Oven Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and prepare a baking tray. While the oven is warming, line a baking tray with parchment paper or spray it with a thin coating of nonstick cooking spray. This prevents the bottom of the chops from sticking to the pan. Place the chops on the baking pan. Lay the chops in the center of the pan. Do not cover the meat, however. You can layer some chopped onion on top of the lamb chops to provide extra flavor. The onions will not caramelize completely in the oven, but they will wilt enough to help flavor the lamb chops. Cook the lamb chops in the oven for 20 minutes, turning once. Use tongs to turn the chops at the 10 minute mark so that both sides are able to brown. The chops are finished once the juices run clear and a meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 155 degrees Fahrenheit (68 degrees Celsius). Allow the chops to rest in the pan for 5 minutes before serving. Letting the meat stand after cooking gives the meat\u2019s juices a chance to redistribute outward from the center of the meat. This makes it much more tender and enjoyable to eat. Making Lamb Chops in a Slow Cooker Slice an onion into long strips and place it in the slow cooker. Once you\u2019ve cut the onion, cover the bottom of a 3 qt (2.84 L) slow cooker with it. The chopped onion should cover the entire bottom of the slow cooker in an even layer. If you want to make clean-up easier later on, you can apply a thin coating of nonstick cooking spray to the inside of the slow cooker. There are also specially designed slow cooker liners you can place in the bottom of the cooker. Place the chops over the onion. Lay as many chops as possible directly on top of the onion layer. You may not be able to fit the chops in a single layer, but a single layer is not necessary for the slow cooker. If desired, you can also add the lamb broth or beef broth, as well. It is not necessary for this particular recipe, but adding a little liquid to slow cooker recipes results in juicier meat. Cook on low for 4 to 6 hours. Cover the slow cooker and cook the chops until the meat is tender enough to pull apart with a fork. If a meat thermometer inserted into the center of one of the chops reads at least 155 \u00b0F (68 \u00b0C), they are ready! Resist the urge to uncover the slow cooker and peek in before the minimum amount of time elapses. Uncovering the slow cooker prematurely can cause the cooker to lose heat and may result in the meat needing up to an additional 30 minutes to cook. Transfer the lamb chops to a serving platter. Layer the onions on top of the chops if you want. Then, enjoy this low-effort dish! Grilling Lamb Chops Remove any stuck-on food from your grill with a brush. If there are remnants of your last meal sticking to your grill grates, use a nylon grill brush to scrub away any burned food bits. This stops any food particles from tainting the flavor of your lamb chops. Treat the grill with nonstick cooking spray and preheat it. Spray the grill grate with nonstick cooking spray and allow the grill to get hot. It\u2019s best to cook lamb chops on an uncovered grill on high heat. For gas grills, heat the grill on high heat with the lid closed for 10 to 15 minutes. For charcoal grills, create three distinct zones. One area should have no coals, one area should have a single layer of coals, and the final area should have two layers of coals. Heat the coals until a layer of ash begins to form on the top. Trim the fat off of the edges of the chops with a knife. Use a sharp knife to cut away the fat along the outside of the chops. The marbled fat throughout the chops adds flavor, not the fat on the end. Moreover, leaving the fat on the ends increases the risk of fiery flare-ups during the cooking process. Oil the grates of the grill using tongs and a rag. Roll an old rag into a cylinder-shape and pour 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of canola oil on one side of it. Once the grill is hot, grip the rolled rag using tongs and rub the surface over the grates to apply the oil. If you don\u2019t want to use a rag, use a paper towel instead. If you do use a rag, store it in a plastic bag for the next time you need to oil your grill. Don\u2019t try to use it for other purposes. Grill the chops on 1 side for 4 minutes. Place the chops directly above the hottest part of the grill and cook over high heat with the lid open. The hottest area of a gas grill is above the primary heating element. The hottest area of a charcoal grill will be above the largest pile of coals. If the flames threaten to flare up, move the chops to a cooler part of the grill until the fire dies down. Flip the chops and continue cooking for 4-5 minutes. After 4-5 minutes have passed, check the internal temperature of the meat with a meat thermometer. At minimum, you should look for an internal temperature of 155 \u00b0F (68 \u00b0C). Remove the lamb chops from the grill and cover them. Loosely cover the chops on a serving dish with a piece of aluminum foil. Let them rest for 5 minutes before serving.",
