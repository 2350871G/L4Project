The goal is to clean the hole up enough that the wall repair patch will sit flat on top of it with no loose debris or ragged paper edges pushing against it or interfering with the adhesive. This method works for holes that are up to about 6 in (15 cm) in diameter. Wall patches come in sizes up to 7\u20138 in (18\u201320 cm) in diameter, and the patch needs to be slightly bigger than the hole to adhere to the wall around it."
