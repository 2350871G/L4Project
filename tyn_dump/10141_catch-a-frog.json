Frogs love water, so areas near ponds, rivers, lakes, and streams are good places to try to catch them. Frogs mostly live on land but will frequently visit wet, shady areas and shallow water. Use a hammer and nail to poke 3-4 holes in 2 medium-sized buckets. You don\u2019t want your buckets to fill with water when you\u2019re trying to catch frogs with them, so take a hammer and a nail to puncture a few holes through the bottom of them. Be careful not to crack the bottom. Smaller frogs may be able to escape through cracks or breaks in the buckets. Cut a slot in both buckets large enough to fit a plywood board.

Make sure the slot is as wide as the thickness of the board so it can fit into it.Tip: Check that the slot is large enough by sliding the board into it.

Make a trench 4 inches (10 cm) deep and as wide as your board. Start the trench at the slot that you cut into the bucket. Make the length of the trench 4 inches (10 cm) shorter than the total length of the plywood board. Make sure the walls of the trench are even and consistent. Dig another hole at the end of the trench for the second bucket. Start right where the trench ends and make sure the hole is deep and wide enough to fit the bucket into it.
