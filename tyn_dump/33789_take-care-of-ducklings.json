A plastic storage container, sturdy cardboard box, or large glass aquarium can all work for this purpose. The box should be well-insulated, since the ducklings need to stay warm. Don't choose a box with too many holes in the sides or the bottom. Line the bottom of the box with wood shavings or old towels. Avoid using newspaper or other slippery material. Ducklings are still wobbly on their legs for the first few weeks after they hatch, and they can slip easily and hurt themselves on surfaces like plastic or newspaper."

Buy a brooding lamp at a feed store or hardware store and affix it to the top of the brooder. Use a 100-watt bulb to start. For very young ducklings, this should create the right amount of heat. Make sure part of the brooder is located away from the heat, so they have a place to cool off if they need to. Make sure the bulb isn't too close to the ducklings. This may cause them to overheat, or if they touch the bulb, they could get burned. If you're using a shallow brooder, prop the lamp up higher using blocks of wood or another sturdy prop"

If the ducklings tend to huddle close together under the lamp, they may be too cold and you should move the lamp closer or get a higher wattage bulb. If the ducklings are scattered out and breathing heavily, they're most likely getting overheated, and you need to move the lamp further away or use a lower wattage bulb.
