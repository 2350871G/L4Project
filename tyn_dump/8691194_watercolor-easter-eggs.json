You can also use liquid watercolor, but keep in mind that it is not suitable for consumption and best for hallow or blown-out eggs. If you are using liquid watercolor, you can make it lighter by adding some water to it. If you don't have any watercolor paint, mix together a few drops of food coloring, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of water. This makes it food safe too. Most kids' watercolor paints are non-toxic and should be food safe. Check the label to be sure, however."
