Your manual will most likely recommend covering the other intake with heavy tape. Purchase motor muffs at a boating store or online.

Wet the muffs to get a better seal. Many boat owners like to splash the insides of the muffs with water before attaching them to the motor. A better seal can help prevent the muffs from sliding off while the engine\u2019s running. Clamp the muffs to the motor and stay clear of the propeller.
