Trim some of the leaves off of the stem before you throw it away if you want to use them as decoration in your boutonniere later on. Wrapping the Stem Stick an 8 in (20 cm) piece of floral wire through the base of the flower. Push one end of the wire right underneath the flower\u2019s base. Make sure your wire is in the middle of the stem so your boutonniere stays balanced. Feed the wire through the other side of the stem until you have 4 inches (10 cm) on each side.
