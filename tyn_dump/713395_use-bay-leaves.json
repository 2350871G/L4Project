                    "description": "This is one case where the majority of chefs recommend using a dried seasoning rather than one that's been freshly-picked. The reason for this is that fresh bay leaves actually come from a different plant altogether (Umbellularia californica, to be exact). Though they're similar in most respects, these leaves have more of a minty, astringent taste that doesn\u2019t work well with many ingredients.Fresh bay leaves have a deeper green color and more supple texture compared to dried ones. The bay leaves sold in the spice aisle of most supermarkets are pre-dried, so you shouldn't have to worry about buying the wrong kind by accident."
