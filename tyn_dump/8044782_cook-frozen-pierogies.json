Pour the water into a large pot and place it over high heat on the stove. Add a heavy pinch of salt to the water as it comes to a boil. Use 2 US qt (1.9 l) of water for every 8-10 pierogies\u2014roughly 12\u201316 oz (340\u2013450 g). Add the frozen pierogies, stir them, and adjust the heat.

Dry the boiled pierogies with paper towels it you\u2019re going to saute them. After you boil the pierogies in water until they float (around 5 minutes), remove them with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with a paper towel. Pat the tops of the pierogies with another paper towel to remove any excess water. If you don\u2019t remove the excess water from the pierogies, the oil will \u201cspit\u201d and splatter when you place them in the skillet to saute them.

When the pierogies are browned to your liking on the bottom, flip them over with a spatula and cook them for another 3-4 minutes. When the other sides are nicely browned as well, remove them from the pan and serve. Recipe: Sauteed Pierogies with Onions and Mushrooms Melt 4 tbsp (60 g) of butter in a large skillet. Place the skillet over medium heat. It will take around 2-3 minutes for the butter to melt. If desired, you can use 2 tbsp (30 g) of butter and 0.125  c (30 ml) of olive oil. Add 12 frozen, pre-cooked pierogies to the pan. Carefully place the frozen pierogies in the pan one at a time so they don\u2019t cause the melted butter to splatter. You\u2019ll get about 12 pierogies in a standard 16 oz (450 g) package of frozen pierogies. If you are using uncooked frozen pierogies, you should boil them on the stove (until they float) or in the microwave (for 5 minutes), then pat them dry before adding them to the skillet. Put 0.75 c (180 g) each of sliced onions and mushrooms into the skillet. Simply dump the sliced onions and mushrooms on top of the pierogies, then nestle them down in between the pierogies with a spatula. If you don\u2019t care for mushrooms, you can use 1.5 c (360 g) of onions instead and omit the mushrooms. Cover the skillet for 2 minutes, then turn the pierogies. Place the lid on the skillet and allow the pierogies, onions, and mushrooms to cook for 2 minutes over medium heat. Then, lift off the lid, flip over all of the pierogies, and stir the onions and mushrooms a bit with your spatula. You should notice some slight browning on the pierogies at this point. Cook the pierogies for 2 more minutes in the covered skillet. Put the lid back on the skillet and let everything cook for another 2 minutes. Then take the lid off, flip the pierogies over, and stir the veggies once more. Cover the skillet and keep checking the pierogies every minute. Keep uncovering the skillet, flipping the pierogies, and stirring the onions and mushrooms until everything is browned to your liking. It will likely take 14-16 minutes total for the pierogies to heat through and become nicely browned on the outside. If the pierogies have browned in 12 minutes or less, turn down the heat to medium-low and cook them for a total of at least 14 minutes. Press down on a pierogi to make sure they are soft and heated through in the middle. Once they\u2019re nicely browned, the pierogies are ready to serve and enjoy!",

        "Add 12 frozen, pre-cooked pierogies to the pan.",
        "Carefully place the frozen pierogies in the pan one at a time so they don\u2019t cause the melted butter to splatter.",
        "You\u2019ll get about 12 pierogies in a standard 16 oz (450 g) package of frozen pierogies.",
        "If you are using uncooked frozen pierogies, you should boil them on the stove (until they float) or in the microwave (for 5 minutes), then pat them dry before adding them to the skillet.",
        "Put 0.75 c (180 g) each of sliced onions and mushrooms into the skillet.",
        "Simply dump the sliced onions and mushrooms on top of the pierogies, then nestle them down in between the pierogies with a spatula.",

        "Place the lid on the skillet and allow the pierogies, onions, and mushrooms to cook for 2 minutes over medium heat.",
        "Then, lift off the lid, flip over all of the pierogies, and stir the onions and mushrooms a bit with your spatula.",

        "It will likely take 14-16 minutes total for the pierogies to heat through and become nicely browned on the outside.",
        "If the pierogies have browned in 12 minutes or less, turn down the heat to medium-low and cook them for a total of at least 14 minutes.",
