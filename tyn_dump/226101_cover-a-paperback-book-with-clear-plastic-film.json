        "Plastic wrapping is available from office supply or craft stores, or online.",
        "Leave 2 inches (5.1 cm) of plastic wrap on the top and bottom of the book.",
        "Lay the book in the center of the plastic sheet.",
        "Then measure 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the top and bottom.",
        "Cut the plastic wrapping at this point so you have enough to wrap the book.",
        "Wrap the plastic on the sides underneath the front and back covers.",
        "Press the plastic down so it fits tightly over both covers.",
        "Use a small strip of clear tape and secure the plastic to the front cover.",
        "This is only supposed to hold the plastic down while you work, so no need to use a lot of tape.",
        "Don't fold the corners of the plastic down yet.",
        "Leave the plastic arranged so 2 inches (5.1 cm) of wrapping are on the top and bottom of the book.",
        "Only use tape on the front cover.",
        "Do not place any tape on the back cover yet.",
        "Cut the plastic at the spine straight down towards the book.",
        "Line up your scissors so they're parallel with the book spine.",
        "Then snip the plastic on the top and bottom of the book straight down.",
        "Get as close to the cover as you can without cutting it.",
        "This gives you 2 tabs at the book spine, 1 on the top and 1 on the bottom.",
        "Snip both tabs off.",
        "If your scissors are long enough, you can snip both layers (front and back) of the plastic at the same time.",
        "If they aren't then cut each one individually.",
        "Snip the remaining corners off the plastic at 45-degree angles.",
        "Again, get as close to the book as you can without cutting the cover.",
        "Do this for the 2 corners on the front and back of the book.",
        "Fold the top and bottom flaps under the cover and tape the plastic down.",
        "Start on the front cover.",
        "Fold the top and bottom flaps down underneath the cover.",
        "Then tape the side flaps to the front flap so no tape touches the book cover.",
        "Then do the same for the back cover.",
        "Keeping tape off the cover makes it easier to replace the cover in the future.",
        "You can just undo the tape holding the plastic together rather than peeling the tape off the cover.",
        "This could damage your book."
