If you prefer, use pork shoulder or another combination of meats, such as turkey or chicken breast. Cut the meat into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes and spread them on a plate or baking sheet. Transfer the plate or baking sheet to the freezer and chill the meat until it becomes crunchy on the surface. Avoid freezing the meat until it's solid. This would make it difficult to grind. To save time, ask your butcher to grind the beef chuck for you. Then you can skip freezing and grinding the meat the first time. Verify that the meat is ground chuck when you purchase it."
