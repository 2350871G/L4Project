            "description": "It is quite straightforward to convert between dried and fresh herb measurements. The rule is: 1 part dried herb is equal to 3 parts fresh herbs. For example, a recipe that calls for a tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh oregano could be prepared using only a teaspoon (5 ml) of dried oregano. A recipe calling for 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of dried basil could be prepared using 1.5 teaspoons (7.5 ml) of fresh basil. The reason for this conversion is that dried herbs have a much lower water content, and therefore have a much higher concentration of essential oils. These oils lead to a more pronounced flavor in a smaller volume of herbs. This conversion works for volume measurements only. Weight conversions will differ from herb to herb; herbs are rarely measured by weight, however."

            "description": "The rule above is not immutable; it should be used only as a general guideline. As dried herbs age in your pantry, they gradually lose their flavor (and color). If your herbs have just been purchased and still have a vibrant color and strong scent, then you should use a little less of them than dictated by the conversion rule. If the herbs have become a bit stale, use a little more to compensate."
