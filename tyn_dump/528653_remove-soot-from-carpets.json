Mixing hydrogen peroxide with warm water dilutes the chemical and prevents further damage to your carpet. Hydrogen peroxide has a bleaching effect, so only use this solution on light-colored carpeting. Test an inconspicuous area of your carpet, like a part of it that is underneath furniture, to determine if it's safe to use on the rest of your carpet. If you have darker-colored carpeting, use rubbing alcohol instead of hydrogen peroxide because it does not have the same bleaching effect. Both hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol are available at supermarkets and most convenience stores."
