Styrofoam Mannequin Head Buy a Styrofoam mannequin head. These heads are white, with features, and they are available at most arts and crafts stores. Many of them are already sized to fit hats or headbands. Miniature versions are also available. Choose a paper that you would like to use to decoupage your foam mannequin head. Decoupage is the art of decorating something by gluing small pieces of paper to it. It is commonly used on small objects, boxes and furniture. Decoupage your mannequin head using strips of paper, such as specialty craft papers, musical scores or magazine pages.  Rip your paper into strips of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less, until you have a large pile.  Use a foam brush to wet the top of the mannequin head with decoupage glue. Place pieces of paper on to of the wet portions, making sure they overlap and there isn't any white space. Place another layer of decoupage glue over the top of the paper pieces, flattening all edges with the brush to ensure a smooth coating of paper. Once the glue and paper dry, you will be unable to flatten any edges, so it is important to take time to smooth it with the glue and brush now. Continue to wet the Styrofoam, attach the paper and glue over the top, using the smaller pieces of paper to fit over the nose, eyes and mouth.  Stop and allow the top of your mannequin head to dry according to the directions on the decoupage glue. When it is dry, balance the top of the mannequin head in a large sturdy cup, so you can glue pieces of paper around the edges, and leave it to dry. Choose a base. You can use an antique plate, a wooden base from an arts and crafts shop, or any sturdy object that will hold your mannequin head steady when you place hats or accessories on it. Foam mannequin heads are very light and unsteady, so it is important to have a base if you intend to use it in a store. Connect the base to your newly decorated mannequin head with hot glue. Allow to dry and then use for decoration or accessories.",
