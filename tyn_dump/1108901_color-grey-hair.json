However, since most permanent dyes can be harsh on your hair, look for a gentle formula with as little ammonia as possible. For example, Clairol Nice 'N Easy is a great permanent dye with low ammonia."

                    "description": "These types of dye won't cover the gray as effectively as a permanent dye will, but they can temporarily blend your grey color a bit. Semi- and demi-permanent dye will usually last anywhere between 4-12 washes, depending on how fine and porous your hair is. This is a good option if your hair is less than 25% grey."

                    "description": "If you're feeling washed out by fully (or almost fully) grey hair, add in some lighter pieces on top or a darker base to kick up the contrast. This is a great way to transform your look without having to dye all of your hair, plus it requires less commitment since you don't need touch-ups as often. Black lowlights can look quite stark against grey hair, so stick to colors around 1-2 shades darker than your natural pre-grey color. For highlights, choose tones ranging between pearl to medium blonde. Use a few ash-blonde streaks to blend the highlights into your natural grey. For the best results, you should always have your highlights done by a professional stylist."

If you're only touching up your roots, choose a dye that matches your original color exactly or looks a shade or 2 darker. The roots are the most translucent part of grey hair, so they may need a slightly darker shade to match your original color."
