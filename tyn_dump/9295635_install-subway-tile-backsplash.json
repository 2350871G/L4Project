Place a cloth or plastic cover over your countertops and appliances. Use a cloth or plastic to cover anything you want to protect from adhesive, grout, and caulk. Most importantly, place cloth or plastic over your countertops, on appliances, and on any furniture in the immediate area. Secure drop clothes to countertops and appliances with painter\u2019s tape.
