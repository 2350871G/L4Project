A good go-to size for an ice block is 10.16 x 43.18 x 43.18 cm (4 x 17 x 17 in). Try to find a box with similar dimensions. At the very least, your block should have a surface area of 30 x 40 cm (11.81 x 15.75 in). Keep in mind that the water will be heavy when it freezes, so you don\u2019t want to pick a box that\u2019s going to be too large and thus too heavy to pick up once it\u2019s frozen. Cardboard boxes are best because they tend to be able to handle the expansion of the water when it freezes into ice. In contrast, plastic boxes might crack."

Cut open a trash bag along one side and along the bottom seam. Pull the two sides of the trash bag apart so you have a single layer of plastic. You should now have one big piece of plastic.

This will prevent your countertops from getting wet, and will also provide you with an easy surface to cut your ice on. If your cutting board won\u2019t fit in your sink, flip the cooler upside-down in the sink, but be prepared to transfer your ice block to a cutting board elsewhere.

If your ice didn\u2019t freeze all the way, you\u2019ll be left with some shell-like pieces that formed at the bottom. Gently hit these pieces with the blade of your knife to loosen them and break them away. Run the ice block under warm water to smooth it out. Your ice block may have some rough, unsightly edges, so running it under a bit of warm water can make the surface look smooth.
