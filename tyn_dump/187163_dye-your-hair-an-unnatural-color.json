You can always go for a darker shade, but the color may not be as vibrant than if your hair was a lighter hue. Lighter hues can also affect the outcome of a dye job. For example, if you are yellowish-blonde and try for a shade of red, your hair may come out orange. Go for blue, and you may end up with green instead. White or grey hair can also make dye much brighter than it actually is. A blue-black shade, for example, could become bright blue. To prevent these mishaps, it would be best to do a test strand before coloring your entire head because it will give you an idea about how the color will turn out."

You can always go darker later if you want. Some shades may not work with your skin tone. If you have a tendency to blush, for example, you may want to avoid going with any pink or red tones. If you have pale skin, bright greens, and yellows could make you appear to be glowing. To see how shades look on you, visit a Halloween store and try on a few wigs to see how the colors look."

They'll also protect your skin from taking on the same color as your hair. Vaseline: Spread a thin layer on your hairline and on your ears. Put it anywhere the dye might come in contact with your skin. Vaseline prevents the dye from staining your skin. Old clothes and towels: Dyeing hair gets messy.
