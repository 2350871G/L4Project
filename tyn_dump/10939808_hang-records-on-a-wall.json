        "Slide the records in gently\u2014it's never a good idea to put additional pressure on the screw hooks, which can be ripped out of the wall.",
        "Repeat this process for each additional row in your layout.",
        "Measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top edge of the records that you\u2019re already displayed on the wall and use a spirit level to draw another straight horizontal line.",
        "Use this as the basis for your next set of screw hooks.",
        "The screws should line up vertically with the screws in the row below.",
        "Showcasing Record Sleeves in Frames Buy play-and-display frames for accessibility.",
        "There are several types of specialty record frames with different pros and cons.",
        "Play-and-display frames feature a front that pops open and latches shut for easy access to the records.",
        "This is one of the more expensive frame options and is best for a collector who plans to play their displayed records frequently.",
        "Frames may be a better option for displaying a small number of records, since they are typically more expensive than other display options.",
        "Go with plain plastic frames for a purely decorative option.",
        "These are typically the most economical choice and often come in packs of 10 or 20.",
        "However, they make it difficult to access your albums and can occasionally be too thin to hold the sleeve with the record inside of it.",
        "You could display either a record sleeve or the actual LP in one of these square frames.",
        "If you plan to display the record itself, don\u2019t use one that you plan to play again, since it will almost certainly get scratched by the frame.",
        "Slide your gatefold albums into a grooved wall hanger.",
        "This type of specialty frame features just a top and bottom rail, which allows you to slide albums in and out.",
        "These are a great option for displaying thicker or gatefold albums, since there\u2019s no glass front.",
        "These are also a more economical option.",
        "Plan your layout for arranging the records on the wall.",
        "Records can be hung in a single, straight row or in a rectangle or square configuration.",
        "Think about the size of your record collection when choosing a layout.",
        "The display will look best if all the rows have the same number of records.",
        "Measure and mark where you want the records to hang.",
        "If you\u2019re hanging multiple records, consider using parchment paper to map out their positioning on the wall.",
        "A good rule of thumb is to leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) between frames, but you could space them out further.",
        "Just make sure they are evenly spaced.",
        "Attach the frame to the wall with indoor mounting tape to prevent permanent marks.",
        "Generally you should to clean and then dry the area wall where you\u2019re applying the tape, but check the instructions on your particular brand of tape to make sure.",
        "Pull off the backing on one side and press it firmly to the frame.",
        "Then, remove the other backing and press the tape firmly into the wall for several seconds.",
        "Double check that the tape you\u2019ve chosen is strong enough to support the weight of the frame.",
        "Most mounting tapes include their weight limit on the packaging.",
        "This is a great option if you're renting and don't want to leave permanent marks on the walls.",
        "Hang the frame with a nail and wire for a more adjustable option.",
        "Hammer a nail into the wall at a slight upwards angle, then slide the frame down over the nail into position.",
        "Use a level to adjust the frame to make sure it\u2019s straight.",
        "Certain frames, such as those featuring top and bottom rails, may come with drywall mounting screws.",
        "Position the frame in place using a level, then use a screwdriver to screw it into the drywall.",
        "Decorating with Sleeveless Records Plan out how you want to arrange the records.",
        "First, determine the shape of your layout.",
        "You could arrange your records in a single straight line, or go with a square or rectangular configuration.",
        "Decide if you want to space the records out with several inches in between, or if you want to line them up so their edges touch.",
        "This display option will scratch up the records, so make sure you\u2019re using records that you don\u2019t plan to play.",
        "If you\u2019ve selected records with brightly colored labels, consider laying them out in a rainbow pattern.",
        "Or, arrange them so the colors are distributed evenly.",
        "If you have enough records, consider lining them up edge to edge so they cover the entire wall\u2014or even the ceiling.",
        "Test your layout by attaching records to the wall with painter\u2019s tape.",
        "Tear off two pieces of painter\u2019s tape and roll them up, then attach them to the back of one of the records.",
        "Stick the record to the wall, and repeat with the rest of your records to test out the layout you\u2019ve settled on.",
        "If you want to make sure that your records are hung straight across, use a spirit level to draw a straight horizontal line.",
        "Then, align the bottom edge of your records with this line.",
        "Use strips of indoor mounting tape to permanently display your records.",
        "Cut 2 2 inches (5.1 cm) strips of tape and stick them on the back of a record.",
        "Peel off the tape backing and press the record firmly against the wall to attach it permanently.",
        "Repeat with the rest of your records until you\u2019ve completed your layout.",
        "You can also use thumbtacks and stick one through the middle of the LP to attach it to the wall.",
        "This will leave a hole in your wall, however."
