Foamcore is a sturdy option if you want to use mixed media or incorporate any three dimensional elements into your design. Foamcore is a little more expensive than poster board. Corrugated plastic sign blanks are very sturdy and can be obtained at most hardware stores, since they are also used for real estate signs.

Easel backs are a self-sticking attachment. You can attach one on either side of the sign and fold out the tabs to use as handles. They are self-sticking so you don\u2019t need extra adhesive. These are great for both poster board and foamcore. Single pieces of 3\u2019\u2019 by 1\u2019\u2019 wood are often used, since you can easily staple or nail the base to a single piece of wood. You will need staples or nails to attach this type of handle to your poster boards. If you are using a heavier base like corrugated plastic, this can be a good option. However, wood is not permitted at many protests. Dowel is sometimes used, which is a little easier to hold for long periods in comparison to 3\u2019\u2019 by 1\u2019\u2019 wood.

        "Paint markers work great for writing text on protest signs.",
        "You can get paint markers at art supply stores.",
        "Repeat this process on the other side of the poster board.",
        "If you are expecting your protest to receive any form of media attention, you should design a double sided sign.",
        "Design the font color.",
        "Some of the best protest signs use font colors that reinforce the message they are trying to convey.",
        "Dark colors are often used to emphasize the gravity of a message.",
        "A rainbow of colors can be used to represent diversity, such as the use of a full rainbow of colors to represent the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community and pride parades.",
        "Use a strong contrast between font color and the background design.",
        "Consider your font or text color in relation to the background design of your poster.",
        "For instance, you may want to use black text against a white background or blue text against an orange background, as opposed to yellow text against an orange background.",
        "Make a connection between the text and the image.",
        "The writing should be reinforced by the image or symbol used on the sign and vice versa.",
        "Some of the best protest signs use imagery that supports the text written on the sign, such as the use of the symbol for female alongside a text saying \u2018Women\u2019s Day March.\u2019 Designing Your Sign Limit your color palete.",
        "Consider using two or three colors instead of incorporating every color you can imagine.",
        "Some of the most successful protest signs use a very limited color palete, so think about which two or three colors will work best for your message and keep it simple.",
        "Artist Lorraine Schneider designed a protest sign with only yellow, orange and black.",
        "The sign included an image of a fragile flower and read \u2018War is not healthy for children and other living things.\u2019 It became famous during the Vietnam War protests.",
        "Try mixed media.",
        "If you are feeling ambitious or are more artistically inclined, you could try mixed media or even three dimensional designs.",
        "Foamcore tends to work better for attaching three dimensional objects to the surface of a protest sign.",
        "For instance, you could attach a three dimensional globe to a foamcore poster at a climate justice protest.",
        "Download an existing poster design.",
        "If you are in a rush, you could always download an existing poster design.",
        "Some organizations involved in the protest you are attending may have some preexisting poster designs available on their websites.",
        "You could also alter an existing poster design with your own text.",
        "Look at the sign from a distance to check readability.",
        "Lean your sign against a wall.",
        "Walk back ten or twenty feet and see if you can read it.",
        "If you can\u2019t read it from a distance, the text may be too small.",
        "If you can\u2019t discern the symbols on your sign, you may want to make them larger.",
        "You could also ask a friend to hold your sign up when testing for legibility.",
        "Add decorations.",
        "Depending on the message you are trying to convey, you may want to add some decorations.",
        "Glitter, sparkles and other eye catching decorations can help to make your protest sign more attractive.",
        "Building Your Sign Choose the material for your poster boards.",
        "The material for the poster board is important to consider, especially if you have to travel to the protest.",
        "The main options are foamcore, corrugated plastic and poster board.",
        "Regardless of the material chosen, you will need two boards to make the sign.",
        "Poster board is a popular and cheap option.",
        "The disadvantage is that it is easily damaged and bent, which can make your sign hard to read.",
        "Foamcore is a sturdy option if you want to use mixed media or incorporate any three dimensional elements into your design.",
        "Foamcore is a little more expensive than poster board.",
        "Corrugated plastic sign blanks are very sturdy and can be obtained at most hardware stores, since they are also used for real estate signs.",
        "If you use this material, you will have to attach the sides together with tape.",
        "Choose the material for your handle.",
        "In order to hold your sign at the protest, you will need to attach some type of handle.",
        "The main options are 3\u2019\u2019 by 1\u2019\u2019 lumber, dowel, paint sticks and easel backs.",
        "You will be securing it to the poster boards with tape, staples, nails or self-sticking glue.",
        "Easel backs are a self-sticking attachment.",
        "You can attach one on either side of the sign and fold out the tabs to use as handles.",
        "They are self-sticking so you don\u2019t need extra adhesive.",
        "These are great for both poster board and foamcore.",
        "Single pieces of 3\u2019\u2019 by 1\u2019\u2019 wood are often used, since you can easily staple or nail the base to a single piece of wood.",
        "You will need staples or nails to attach this type of handle to your poster boards.",
        "If you are using a heavier base like corrugated plastic, this can be a good option.",
        "However, wood is not permitted at many protests.",
        "Dowel is sometimes used, which is a little easier to hold for long periods in comparison to 3\u2019\u2019 by 1\u2019\u2019 wood.",
        "This is a good option for corrugated plastic sign blanks.",
        "You will need staples or nails.",
        "However, wood is not permitted at many protests.",
        "Attach the handle to the poster boards.",
        "Place one of the two poster boards on the ground.",
        "Then, place your handle in the middle of the sign.",
        "Attach the handle to the base of the sign using tape, staples or nails.",
        "Then, place the second poster board on top.",
        "Alternately, you could just attach one poster board to the handle.",
        "You will have a one-sided protest sign.",
        "Normally, protest signs have things written on both sides.",
        "If you are on a budget, or one of the boards is torn up, it is very simple to make a sign with only one side.",
        "Make the handle comfortable.",
        "You may want to wrap the handle with some tape to make it easier to hold for long periods of time.",
        "Wrap hockey tape or electrical tape around the handle to make it easier to hold.",
        "If you have a hard time making the handle comfortable to hold, you may benefit from a plan B.",
        "For instance, you could attach a string to the top of the sign.",
        "When you get tired of holding the handle, you can put the string around your neck."
