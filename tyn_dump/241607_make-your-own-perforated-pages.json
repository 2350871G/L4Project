Make a Tool - Method #1 Obtain a rotary pizza cutter.  Mark 5 degree increments along the outer edge with permanent marker.  File or grind away the edge between the marks using a Dremel bit or a hand file.  Leave small, sharp edges/points every 5 degrees.  Roll your tool along the line to be perforated.
