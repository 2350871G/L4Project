    "text": " Sew a Pillow Cut 2 pieces of fabric that each measure about 15 -20 inches square. You can make the squares smaller or larger if you'd prefer. For a more interesting decorative throw pillow, use 2 different fabrics. You can opt for 1 piece of silk and 1 piece of velvet or 2 pieces of cotton fabric in contrasting colors. Place 1 piece of fabric on a table, right-side up. Set the other piece of fabric on top of the first, right-side down. Pin the fabrics together on all 4 sides. Stitch the fabrics together along the 4 edges, .5 inch (1.27 cm) from the edge. Leave a 5-inch (12.7 cm) gap on 1 side of the decorative throw pillow for turning it right-side out and stuffing it. Clip the corners of the pillow before turning it right-side out. Make sure you don't cut through the seam. Trimming the corners will make them sharp instead of rounded when the pillow is right-side out. Turn the decorative throw pillow right-side out, and stuff it with the polyester batting. Use enough batting to make the pillow slightly firm but still soft. Thread the hand sewing needle, and use a slip stitch to sew the gap on the pillow closed.  Sew a Throw Pillow with Fringe Cut 2 squares of fabric that each measure between 18 to 25 inches (45.72 to 63.5 cm). Cut a length of fringe that measures 4 times the width of the fabric. Set 1 piece of fabric on a work surface, right-side up. Lay the fringe along the edges of the fabric square. The fringe should face into the center of fabric. Pin the fringe in place, and sew it to the fabric of the decorative throw pillow with a long basting stitch. Set the second piece of fabric on top of the first, right-side facing down, and pin together. Stitch along the 4 edges of the fabric, .5 inch (1.27 cm) from the edge. Leave a 5-inch (12.7 cm) gap so you can stuff the pillow. Clip the corners of the throw pillow, then turn it right-side out. Stuff the decorative throw pillow with the batting, and hand sew the gap closed. Sew a Pillow with a Zipper Cut 2 square pieces of fabric that measure 20 inches (50.8 cm) on each side. Set the 2 pieces of fabric on top of each other, right-sides facing in. Pin the fabrics together only along 1 side. Sew the fabric for the decorative throw pillow together along the pinned edge with a long basting stitch. Remove the pins, and press the basted seam open and flat. Place the zipper on the wrong side of the seam, and center the zipper's teeth over the sewn portion of the seam.  Put the zipper foot on your sewing machine. Stitch the zipper to the seam on each side of the fabric. Remove the basting stitches from the seam, and open the zipper. The zipper needs to be open so that you can stuff the pillow when you're finished sewing. Place the fabrics on top of each other, right-sides facing in again, and pin on the 3 remaining sides.  Stitch along the 3 sides of the decorative throw pillow, .25 inch (.64 cm) from the edge.  Turn the pillow right-side out, and slide the pillow form in through the zippered opening. Close the zipper.",
