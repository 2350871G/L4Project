It should be tender and spring back to the touch. Make sure it has a fresh, clean smell. Try to ensure the brisket you buy has not been frozen. Frozen brisket makes for a less tender finished product. Lift the brisket. If it feels stiff or flops over, either it has been frozen or it is no longer fresh."

Choose a piece of meat with a good \"fat cap\" - the white layer of fat at the tip of the brisket - and plenty of marbling all over the meat. The only part of the meat without much fat is the flat section. The fat should be bright white. If it looks yellow, the meat has likely been frozen or is not fresh."

Smoking the Brisket Get the smoker or grill ready. Smokers cook meat slowly with indirect heat, allowing the fat from the meat to soften and distribute through the tissue, making it tender and delicious.

Serving the Brisket Slice the brisket against the grain. This ensures the meat stays tender and does not fall apart. Slice the meat as thin or as thick as you like it. Serve the brisket. It is wonderful on its own with barbecue sauce, but you can also serve it on sandwich buns.",
