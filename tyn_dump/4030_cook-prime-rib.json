But, rest assured, Beef Bone-In Rib Roast is what you want. If you are really thinking ahead, you can special order a prime-quality bone-in rib roast. Ask your butcher when he can have you one ready by. Odds are one won't be readily available because the cost incurred is much higher than other grades. You're looking for ribs 6 through 12. If your butcher knows his meat, he'll get you one from the small end toward the back of the rib section. It's generally leaner and gives you more bang for your buck. This is usually called the first cut on the loin, or small, end, because the ribs get larger as they get closer to the shoulder. If you prefer more fat, you may want to go a different route. To help you decide, the small end is where the Ribeye steaks are produced and the large end is used for Delmonico steaks. Does that help?"
