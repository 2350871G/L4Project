Use all the resources you have available to you to finish the review and study. Refer to your notes, textbook, previous homework assignments, and online help if necessary. Show all of your work. Partial credit is a great way to gain points on quizzes and tests. If you don\u2019t show the work of how you arrived at an answer, you are at risk of getting the whole question wrong even if you just added the last two numbers at the end incorrectly. Showing your work lets the professor know that you understand the concept, you may have just made a small arithmetic error. Answer the easy questions first. When taking the exam, work on the easiest questions first. If you come across a problem that you are unsure of, skip it and move on. You can always go back to those problems at the end of the test and focus on them once you\u2019ve answered everything else. Don\u2019t forget that you can also ask questions during the exam. Your professor may not be able to answer it, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. Get enough sleep the night before the exam. Cramming late into the night is not going to help you during the exam as much as a good night\u2019s sleep will. If you have stayed on a consistent study schedule, you won\u2019t need to cram because you will have been reviewing everything all along. Make sure you aren\u2019t hungry during the test, either.",
