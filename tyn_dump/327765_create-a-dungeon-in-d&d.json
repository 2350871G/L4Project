I'd suggest the dungeon crawl for beginners because it requires little story or role-playing on your part (assuming that handling NPCs will be challenging for you in the beginning stages of DMdom). Anyway, a dungeon crawl is basically just your average dungeon with random monsters plaguing its caverns, a few random traps, and some random treasure. It may sound difficult with all of this \"random\" stuff, but it is actually very simple."

Here are some things that all dungeon crawls have: at least 1 encounter with 3 or more weak monsters. At least 1 encounter with a not-too-tough-and-not-to-easy monster. At least 1 encounter with a \"boss monster\" that will be the final challenge in the dungeon. At least one trap or locked door that the rogue or bard can disable or pick. At least a total treasure of 100 GP per party level per party player (i.e. for a group of 5 4th-level characters, reward each of them 400 GP). At least a total treasure of one magic item per party member (if they are above first level. If they are first level, just give them non-magical items, such as masterwork weapons, precious stones, and perhaps some platinum pieces. These 6 \"musts\" are essential to any dungeon.
