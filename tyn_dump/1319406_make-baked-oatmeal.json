Try to get something that is around 8 by 12 inches (20.32 by 30.48 centimeters) or 9 by 13 inches (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters). Mix together the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Measure out the old fashioned oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and brown sugar. For extra flavor, add some ground nutmeg. Put everything into a large bowl, and mix together until evenly combined. In a separate container, whisk together the milk, eggs, and vanilla. You can use another bowl, or a large, glass measuring cup. Beat everything together until the yolks break, and you get an even color. There should be no streaks or swirls. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, then sir in the melted butter. Keep stirring with a whisk or spatula until everything is evenly combined. Pour half of the oatmeal mixture into the baking dish, then top with your desired filling. Popular choices include berries or apples. You can also use 2 cups (200 grams) worth of other ingredients as well, such as chopped nuts or bananas. Pour the rest of the oatmeal mixture over your filling. Gently sway the baking dish from side to side. This will help spread your mixture evenly across the baking dish, and help everything settle. Bake, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the top turns golden brown. The oats should be set; they should not jiggle much when you move them. Let cool for a few minutes, then cut and serve.
