Women who identify as lesbian or bisexual are likely to be more open to dating crossdressers. Make sure your photo is clear, well-lit, and shows you looking your best! Sites like AdultFriendFinder, Crossdresser Dating Site, and FriendFinder-x are good places to start. Some sites (like Crossdresser Hookup) are particularly geared toward no-strings-attached hookups (not relationships), so know what you\u2019re looking for before you sign up! If you come across someone you like on one of these sites, send them a friendly message to find out if they\u2019re into dating crossdressers. For instance, you could say, \u201cHey, your profile caught my eye. I see that you\u2019re bisexual, so I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re into crossdressing men?\u201d"
