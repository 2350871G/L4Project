    "text": " Using a Sharpening Rod Purchase a serrated knife sharpening tool. Serrated knives need different sharpeners than straight-edged blades. Most serrated knife sharpeners are rod-shaped, usually with a taper to accommodate different sized serrations. Locate the side of your knife with a beveled edge. Serrated knives generally do not look the same from both sides. On one side, the face of the blade will continue at the same angle until the blade's edge. On the other, the face of the blade will angle down slightly just before the serrated edge; this is called the bevel. Only apply a sharpening tool to the beveled edge. Place the sharpening rod in one of the serrated scallops (\"gullets\"). Choosing an angle is easier for serrated blades, because you can use the angle of the bevel as a guide.

You'll know you're hitting them at the right angle if the marker is removed. Move the rod to match the gullet's diameter. If your sharpening rod is tapered, locate the rod in the gullet at the point where the rod's diameter is the same size as the gullet's, or slightly smaller. Sharpen the first gullet. Run the sharpening rod along the first groove in several short strokes. Push in one direction away from the edge of the blade, toward the spine. Rotate the rod as you push it for a more even grind. Push only to the point of the rod with the same diameter as the gullet, to avoid enlarging the gullet. Check for a burr. Run your fingers along the backside of the groove to check for a \"burr,\" or metal shavings. As soon as you can feel a burr, you have sharpened the groove sufficiently. This often only takes a few strokes. Try running your fingernail along the back edge. If you feel it catch, there's a burr. Continue sharpening each groove on the blade. If the knife's serrations are different sizes, adjust the position of the tapered sharpening rod so that the rod just fills the groove. File away all the burrs. The burrs are the metal shavings that you filed off when sharpening the blade. To remove them, rub the back of the knife against a sheet of fine-grit sandpaper. As an alternative, you could lightly run the sharpening rod against the backside of each groove, being careful not to apply more pressure than necessary to remove the shavings.

Don't attempt to use the serrated knife sharpener on the straight portion of the blade. Using Other Tools Use a triangle-shaped sharpener. Like the rods, these tapered triangles are designed specifically for serrated knives. Due to the shape, they tend to work best on knives with V-shaped gullets. The process is almost identical to the rod-shaped method described above, except that you rock the edge of the tool back and forth along the bevel instead of rotating it.
