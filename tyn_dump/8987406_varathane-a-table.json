Applying the First Coat Choose between water- and oil-based Varathanes. Oil-based Varathane will be more heat resistant and durable.

There should be no drips, unevenness, or pooling. Clean your brush while you wait for this coat of Varathane to dry so you can use it for the next coat too. Finishing the Application Test the coat for dryness. Oil-based Varathane will take 24 hours to dry; water-based ones only take 4 to 6 hours. After this time has passed, test its dryness by gently sanding an out of sight portion with 220-grit sandpaper. If you find that the Varathane isn\u2019t yet dry, wait about an hour or two before testing it again with 220-grit paper. Sand the coat lightly with 220-grit sandpaper when dry.
