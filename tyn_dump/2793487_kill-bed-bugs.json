Heat is an effective way to  kill bed bugs, but garments must be laundered at temperatures of 49 degrees Celcius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in order for the heat treatment to be effective. Avoid taking your garments to a dry-cleaner. Dry-cleaning your garments will usually kill the bugs, but your infested garments may cause a bed bug outbreak at the dry-cleaners."

To improve your success rate, make sure to get in all cracks and crevices, and scrape the vacuum against all fabric surfaces to yank any eggs or stubborn adult bugs up.
