Get off of your ladder and reposition it at the other end of your roof. Pull the tape measure along the length of your roof and climb up the ladder in the new position to take your measurement. Write down your measurement so you don\u2019t forget it later on. Keep taking measurements for any other sections of your roof where you need to install fascia boards. If you\u2019re replacing an old fascia board, you can measure the old board instead of your roof. Never stand on the top step of a ladder since you\u2019ll be more likely to fall."

Choose boards that are 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick so they fit easily onto the ends of your rafters. The ends of your rafters are usually either 6 or 8 inches (15 or 20 cm) tall, so boards that are 8 or 10 inches (20 or 25 cm) tall will work best. You can buy boards for your fascia from a hardware or home improvement store. Woods made from pine, spruce, or cedar all work well for fascia board. You may not be able to buy boards that are the exact length of your roof. If not, then get as many boards as you need to match the length."

Continue cutting the rest of the boards to the lengths you need. Ask the employees where you bought the boards to see if they can cut them for you if you don\u2019t have the tools at home. You may also use a handsaw if you want, but it will take longer and may not be as precise as a table saw. Always keep your hands and fingers away from the saw blade, or else you could get seriously injured.Tip: If you can\u2019t saw the boards to the exact length you need, then split the measurement between boards of equal length. For example, if you need 24 feet (7.3 m) of fascia board, you can cut 2 boards that are 12 feet (3.7 m) each or 3 boards that are 8 feet (2.4 m) each."
