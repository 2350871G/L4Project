Then flip the paper over to trace the mirror image onto your eraser. You can use any color or size of eraser. A thicker eraser will be easier to cut since there's more to work with, and will hold up better over time. Mirroring is especially important if you\u2019re using numbers or letters. How to Transfer a Design to an Eraser\n1. Trace or print your design onto a piece of clear tracing paper. If you\u2019re tracing it by hand, a thick permanent marker works best. 2. Turn the paper over so you have the mirror image. 3. Hold the clear paper with the design over your eraser or tape it into place. 4. Cut along the lines through the paper to transfer the outline onto the eraser."

        "Dab the sponge in paint to fully saturate the front of the stamp.",
        "You don\u2019t need the paint to soak through the entire sponge.",
        "Dip the front of the stamp into paint, then tap it lightly on a scrap piece of paper to remove any excess.",
        "If you don\u2019t dab the sponge on a piece of paper a couple of times before putting it on your final surface, you\u2019ll likely end up using too much paint and it will smear or blur together.",
        "Choose your paint type based on your surface.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re stamping a T-shirt, use fabric paint.",
        "If you\u2019re decorating a wall, opt for interior wall paint instead.",
        "Pour the paint into a tray or shallow dish to make it easier to coat the stamp.",
        "Push the stamp onto your surface, applying pressure evenly on all areas.",
        "If you\u2019re only pushing down in the center, the paint will pool there, distorting your design.",
        "Press each edge and section of the stamp firmly onto the surface to ensure that the entire stamp has transferred properly.",
        "You should only hold your stamp on the surface for about 3 to 5 seconds.",
        "Otherwise, you risk over-saturating the print.",
        "When you go to remove the stamp from the surface, lift straight up, trying not to drag or smear the stamp.",
        "Ways to Use Stamps\nMake your own gift wrap by printing a pretty pattern on plain craft paper.",
        "Stamp a hand towel for a personalized kitchen accessory.",
        "Paint a wall border around the edge of a room.",
        "Create homemade cards for any occasion.",
        "Give the stamps as gifts to someone who loves to craft.",
        "Wash your stamp off with water before the paint dries.",
        "Whenever you're finished with your stamp, immediately run it under water in the sink to remove the paint.",
        "Wash it until the water is clear and there are no traces of color on the sponge.",
        "If the paint dries and hardens on your sponge, the stamp will be ruined and you'll have to create a new one.",
        "You can use either warm or cold water.",
        "Using a Potato Cut a potato in half horizontally.",
        "Use a sharp knife to slice through the potato width-wise, making sure the surface of the cut is completely smooth and flat.",
        "Otherwise, the stamp won\u2019t be able to press down evenly.",
        "To choose the size of your potato, look for one that can fit the cookie cutter you\u2019re using at its widest portion.",
        "You can also use sweet potatoes to make your stamps.",
        "A serrated knife is the best for making a clean cut in the potato.",
        "If you want to be able to grip your potato better, sculpt a small handle at the top of the potato by cutting 2 grooves on either side, leaving a piece to hold onto.",
        "Press a cookie cutter into the cut side of the potato.",
        "Set the cookie cutter down on a flat surface, then push the potato firmly onto it.",
        "It doesn\u2019t need to go all the way into the potato.",
        "Insert the cookie cutter just enough that it creates a significant indication in the potato.",
        "Metal cookie cutters are sturdier and easier to push into the potato.",
        "The sharper side of the cookie cutter, also known as the imprinting edge, is the side that should go into the potato.",
        "If your design is asymmetrical, like a word, be sure to flip the cookie cutter so you push the mirror image into the potato.",
        "That way, when you stamp the picture, it reflects back to the proper picture.",
        "Use the knife to cut a thick slice around the cookie cutter.",
        "This will create the stamp.",
        "Leave the cookie cutter in place and run the knife around the potato.",
        "Remove a slice big enough to leave the design raised off the rest of the potato.",
        "Cut through to the cookie cutter as you drag the knife around the potato so the slice is easier to remove.",
        "The slice needs to be thick enough that you can paint the top of the stencil design without getting smudges from the areas of the potato that aren\u2019t supposed to have paint.",
        "Pull the cookie cutter out of the potato.",
        "Grip the potato in one hand and carefully extract the stencil from the other side.",
        "Try to pull it straight out and avoid wiggling it so you don\u2019t ruin the edges of the stamp.",
        "If necessary, use an X-Acto knife to touch up any shaping around the outline of the stamp or remove any additional pieces of potato that you want to.",
        "Coat the design on the cut side of the potato with a thin layer of paint.",
        "Don\u2019t put on too much paint or it will clump up and make the stamped image smeared and unreadable.",
        "Use a paintbrush to apply enough paint to just cover the stamp.",
        "If you\u2019re stamping on paper, use watercolor or acrylic paint.",
        "If you\u2019re doing it on a wall, go with interior wall paint, and if you\u2019re designing on textiles, try fabric paint.",
        "You can also pour some paint into a tray.",
        "Dip the cut side of potato into the paint, then dab off some of the extra before stamping the design.",
        "Make sure every nook and cranny is painted properly.",
        "Flip the potato over and press the painted side firmly onto your surface.",
        "Avoid placing the stamp down at an angle.",
        "Push it firmly onto your paper, wall, or fabric, applying pressure across the entire stamp so it creates an even design.",
        "Lift the stamp straight up when you\u2019re finished.",
        "If you move the stamp while you\u2019re pushing down or if you press down too harshly, you\u2019ll smudge the final print."
