        "Start by combining it with liquid ingredients first like eggs and oil, then mix in the dry ingredients like flour and baking soda.",
        "If there\u2019s still no foam after 15 minutes, the water may have been too hot.",
        "Try activating another packet with water of a lower temperature.",
        "Store unused yeast in the back of your freezer.",
        "Transfer the yeast into an airtight container and store it in the freezer.",
        "Place it near the back so it's not exposed to temperature changes from opening the door.",
        "It will stay good for 6 months if frozen.",
        "You can also refrigerate dry yeast, but it will only keep for 4 months.",
        "Making Bread with Instant Yeast Combine the dry ingredients into a bowl.",
        "Pour 4 cups (544 grams) of flour into a large bowl with 2 7-gram packets of instant rapid-rise yeast.",
        "If your yeast packets have more or less than that amount, measure out 2 tablespoons (28.3 grams) of yeast.",
        "Instant yeast is pre-activated and allows you to skip the first proofing of the dough that\u2019s required with regular yeast doughs.",
        "That means you\u2019ll only need proof the dough once for a short period of time.",
        "Add the sugar and salt to the bowl.",
        "Use a measuring tool to add 2 teaspoons (8.4 grams) of sugar and 1 teaspoon (4.2 grams) of salt.",
        "Blend the dry ingredients with your fingers for even distribution.",
        "Even though the yeast is already activated, it feeds on the sugar, allowing the bread to rise at a faster rate.",
        "Pour in 2 cups (470 mL) of hot water and \u20444 cup (59 mL) of oil.",
        "Make sure the water is between 110\u00b0F (48\u00b0C) and 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C).",
        "Test it with your hand\u2014it should be a little hotter than bath water but not too hot to handle.",
        "Use your hands to combine the wet and dry ingredients until the dough becomes sticky.",
        "Canola or vegetable oil are perfect for breads, but feel free to experiment with flavor by using sesame, garlic, avocado, or walnut oil.",
        "Incorporate the remaining 1 cup (128 grams) of flour.",
        "Use your hands to stir in the remaining flour about 2 or 3 tablespoons (16 or 24 grams) at a time.",
        "Move your hands in circular motions around the bowl and from top to bottom.",
        "Make sure to scrape down any flour or sticky bits on the sides of the bowl.",
        "You can also mix the dough by using a stand mixer that has a dough hook attachment.",
        "Set it on low speed for 3 minutes or until the dough clings to the hook.",
        "Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until it\u2019s smooth and elastic.",
        "Lay the dough on a flat, lightly-floured surface (like a cutting board) and shape it into a mound.",
        "Then press the heels of your palms forward and down into the dough.",
        "Use your fingers to lift the dough at the far end and fold it in toward you at the half-way point.",
        "Repeat this kneading motion for about 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Kneading the dough is essential to strengthen the gluten, which gives the bread its structure and pillowy texture.",
        "You may need to sprinkle a few pinches of flour onto the dough as you knead it to keep it from sticking to the surface.",
        "Test to see if the dough is ready for proofing.",
        "The dough is fully kneaded when it\u2019s smooth and feels slightly tacky.",
        "If you poke the kneaded dough, the indentation should bounce right back.",
        "If not, continue kneading it for another minute or two and test it again.",
        "Perform the window-pane test by pulling off a little ball of dough and stretching it apart with your fingers.",
        "If it\u2019s ready for proofing, the dough will stretch into a thin film and not break.",
        "If it breaks, keep kneading.",
        "Place the dough into a bowl and cover it with a damp towel for 30 minutes.",
        "Use a bowl that\u2019s large enough to hold the dough\u2014it will expand to about twice its size.",
        "Cover it with a damp tea towel to trap heat and moisture, expediting the rate it will rise.",
        "Place the bowl in a warm area to speed up the rise even more.",
        "Poke the bread with your finger to test if it\u2019s ready for baking.",
        "The indentation should bounce back about half way.",
        "If it fully bounces back, it needs more proofing time.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t bounce back at all, it\u2019s been over-proofed.",
        "If this happens, mash all the air out of it and let it proof again until it rises an inch below the rim of the bowl.",
        "This is a good time to preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
        "Divide the dough into two pieces and place them into oiled pans.",
        "Split the dough into two pieces with your hands and roll each piece into a cylindrical shape.",
        "Try to make each piece even so they\u2019ll have a similar baking time.",
        "Lightly oil each loaf pan and place each cylinder of dough into the center of each one.",
        "Let the dough sit in the pans until each chunk of dough has risen to the rims.",
        "Insert the pans into the hot oven and set a timer for 40 minutes.",
        "Place the loaf pans on the top oven rack if you want the bread to have a toasted top.",
        "Using the bottom rack will cause the bottom of the loaf to brown more.",
        "The bread is done baking when the top is dry, firm, and has taken on a deep golden brown color.",
        "Rotate the loaves at the 20 minute mark to ensure even baking.",
        "To test for doneness, take the bread out of the oven after 40 minutes and insert an instant-read thermometer into the center.",
        "A temperature of 190\u00b0F (87\u00b0C) is a good sign that the bread is finished baking.",
        "You can also insert a skewer into the center of each loaf to test for doneness.",
        "A clean skewer means the bread is fully baked.",
        "Use oven mitts to transfer each loaf to a cooling rack for 1 hour.",
        "A cooling rack will keep air circulating around the loaf and prevent the crust from getting soggy.",
        "Slowly flip each tin over onto the rack to remove each loaf.",
        "If some parts stick to the pan, use a fork or spoon to carefully wedge the loaf out of the tin and onto the rack.",
        "Let each loaf cool for 1 hour or longer before slicing them with a serrated knife.",
        "Check each loaf again for doneness by tapping on the bottom with your fingers.",
        "A hollow sound indicates the bread is fully baked while a dull, dense sound means it needs to go back into the oven.",
        "Store baked bread at room temperature in a brown paper bag.",
        "Don\u2019t put it in the refrigerator as doing so causes the starches to crystallize, resulting in stale bread.",
        "Cooking with Nutritional Yeast Substitute cheese with nutritional yeast in various dishes.",
        "Many vegans add nutritional yeast to a variety of dishes to mimic the flavor of cheddar cheese.",
        "Sprinkle it over popcorn, salads, stir-fries, rice bowls, pastas, soups, and tofu dishes to amp up the flavor of your meal.",
        "Make vegan cashew queso by blending it with soaked cashews, salsa, turmeric, salt, and any other additions you like in your dip.",
        "Thicken soups and sauces with nutritional yeast.",
        "The small flakes soak up moisture, thickening soups and sauces without the added calories of cream, flour, or other starches.",
        "Note that it will affect the flavor of the soup or sauce, giving it a nutty, cheesy taste.",
        "Add 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) to gravies, mac and cheese, creamy salad dressings, and mashed potatoes in place of starch thickeners.",
        "Use nutritional yeast as a source of B-12.",
        "Fortified nutritional yeast contains vitamin B-12, a necessary nutrient that\u2019s hard to get on a plant-based diet.",
        "Just note that the yeast must read \u201cfortified\u201d on the label because unfortified nutritional yeast won\u2019t have B-12.",
        "A little less than 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) provides the recommended daily amount of B-12.",
        "If you purchase nutritional yeast from bulk bins at the grocery store, check with the manager or one of the employees to make sure it\u2019s fortified.",
        "Store nutritional yeast is a dry airtight container.",
        "Any moisture can cause the nutritional yeast to grow mold or bacteria, so make sure it\u2019s protected in a glass or plastic container.",
        "You can store it in the refrigerator or in the pantry for up to 2 years (although it\u2019s best to use it within a month for maximum flavor).",
        "If the nutritional yeast tastes bitter or malty, throw it away.",
        "Contact with water can cause mold and other bacteria to grow"
