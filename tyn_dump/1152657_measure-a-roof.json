        "Draw a diagram of your roof on a large piece of paper.",
        "Make a rough top-down sketch of your roof.",
        "Pencil in the outlying shape, then flesh out your diagram with details like ridge lines, hips, valleys, and dormers until you have a rough representation of your roof\u2019s basic layout.",
        "Your diagram doesn\u2019t need to be perfect.",
        "All that matters is that you have a visual aid to keep up with the various dimensions you\u2019ll be using to make your final calculations.",
        "Use a pencil rather than a pen.",
        "That way, you\u2019ll be able to make corrections and revisions as needed while you work.",
        "Use the measurements you took to label your diagram.",
        "Write down the length and width of each corresponding section of the roof, starting with the outer edges where the eaves are.",
        "Then, put down the length of the ridge lines on each peak, hip, and valley.",
        "The idea is to reduce your roof to a series of lines in order to simplify your subsequent calculations.",
        "Divide the roof up into simple geometrical sections.",
        "At this point, you may notice that many of your roof\u2019s planes are irregular.",
        "The easiest way to get around this problem is to draw a few extra lines to turn complex shapes into simple ones.",
        "For example, drawing a line across the tapered end of a gabled roof will create a long rectangle connected to a small triangle.",
        "Keep lining off the different parts of your roof until each section is a square, rectangle, or triangle.",
        "Breaking your diagram up into smaller sections may seem unnecessarily complicated, but it will actually make your final calculations much faster and easier (unless you want to figure out how to find the area of a trapezoid).",
        "Multiply the length by the width to find the area of rectangular sections.",
        "Determining the square footage of these sections is easy.",
        "Just multiply the length and width dimensions.",
        "Make a note of the square footage of each square or rectangular section on your diagram.",
        "If a section is 120 feet (37 m) x 100 feet (30 m), its total square footage would be 12,000 square feet (1,100 m).",
        "Be sure to find the area of any dormers on your roof, as well.",
        "Work out the area of the remaining triangular sections.",
        "This isn\u2019t as difficult as you might think.",
        "First, use a ruler to draw a line from the center of the longest side of the triangle (the eave) to the point (the roof\u2019s peak).",
        "Then, multiply the length of the longest side by the length of this central line.",
        "Divide this number by 2 to get the square footage of the triangle.",
        "The basic formula for finding the area of a triangle is \u00bd the base times the height (in this case, the distance between the base and the peak).",
        "If you have a roof section that's 30 feet (9.1 m) long and 12 feet (3.7 m) high, multiplying those dimensions would give you an area of 180 square feet (17 m).",
        "Measure and mark the square footage of each triangular section carefully, as these tend to differ in size.",
        "Add up the areas of each section to get your total square footage.",
        "Punch each of the area measurements you deduced into a calculator one by one.",
        "The sum of these numbers is the overall square footage of your roof, which you can then use to work out how much material you\u2019ll need for your project.",
        "Together, two 750 sq ft (70 m) rectangular planes and four 135 sq ft (12.5 m) triangular planes would give you a total area of 2,040 square feet (190 m).",
        "Add up the numbers a few times to ensure that the final figure you get is correct.",
        "Take your time and work carefully to prevent mistakes.",
        "Even a small miscalculation could end up costing you time or money.",
        "Divide your square footage by 100 to estimate your materials.",
        "Roofing materials are typically packaged in \u201csquares,\u201d each of which is the equivalent of 100 square feet (9.3 m) of roof space.",
        "Dividing the total area of your roof by 100 will therefore help you figure out how many squares worth of shingles to order.",
        "For a 12,000 sq ft (1,100 m) roof, you\u2019ll need a minimum of 120 squares.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to add an extra 10% to your estimated material requirements to account for waste and ensure that you have enough shingles to cover your roof when it\u2019s all said and done.",
        "Using the above example, that would be 132 squares.",
        "Measuring Your Roof from the Ground Find the length and width of the building\u2019s exterior walls.",
        "Stretch your tape measure along the walls from end to end in both directions.",
        "Record these measurements in your notebook.",
        "Along with the roof\u2019s pitch, you\u2019ll use these 2 dimensions to calculate the roof\u2019s overall square footage.",
        "Once you've measured the building\u2019s walls, estimate the length of the overhangs on either side (if your roof has them).",
        "The easiest way to do this is to simply eyeball them and approximate how long each one is in feet.",
        "Add these figures to your recorded measurements to account for the additional area.",
        "Estimating the area from ground level is less precise than measuring each side individually, but it can make a quick, easy, and safe alternative when redoing a square or rectangular roof.",
        "To measure an irregularly-shaped roof, you'll need to get on top.",
        "Calculate the pitch of the roof.",
        "The pitch is the steepness of the roof.",
        "To find the pitch of your roof, you\u2019ll first need to set up a ladder tall enough to reach it.",
        "Place a level against the rooftop a few feet in from the edge and angle it so that the floating bubble is centered, then measure the distance from the end of the level to the surface of the roof.",
        "Pitch is expressed as \u201cX-in-12 (inches)\u201d.",
        "If you\u2019re using a 1 ft (0.30 m) level, the pitch is the distance between the edge of the level and the roof\u2019s surface.",
        "A distance of 7 inches (18 cm), for example, would mean your roof has a pitch of 7-in-12.",
        "If you\u2019re using a 2 ft (0.61 m) level, divide the distance between the level and the roof by 2 to get the true pitch.",
        "A 14 in (36 cm) difference, for example, indicates a pitch of 7 in (18 cm).",
        "The terms \u201cpitch\u201d and \u201cslope\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably when describing roofing projects.",
        "Use a pitch multiplier table to determine what figure to use.",
        "Pitch multiplier tables make it easy to use a particular pitch to estimate a roof\u2019s square footage.",
        "Run a search for \"pitch multiplier table\" and look for the measurement of your roof\u2019s pitch in inches on the left side of the table.",
        "Write down the corresponding pitch multiplier for use in your following calculations.",
        "For example, a roof with a rise of 3-in-12 will have a pitch multiplier of 1.031, while one with a rise of 8 in 12 will use a multiplier of 1.202.",
        "You should be able to pull up a number of reliable pitch multiplier tables with a quick Internet search.",
        "Multiply the area by the pitch multiplier to get the roof's square footage.",
        "First, multiply the length by the width.",
        "Then, take the product of these two dimensions and multiply it by your pitch multiplier.",
        "The number you get will be an accurate estimate of how much area you have to cover for your roofing project.",
        "If your roof measures 48 feet (15 m) x 24 feet (7.3 m), multiplying its length by its width would give you a square footage of 1,152 square feet (107.0 m).",
        "If its pitch is 6-in-12 (a pitch multiplier of 1.12), multiplying 1,152 sq ft (107.0 m) by 1.12 would give you an overall square footage of 1,290 square feet (120 m).",
        "Divide your estimated square footage by 100 to estimate your materials.",
        "Roofing materials are bundled in \"squares\" that contain enough shingles to cover 100 square feet (9.3 m).",
        "Dividing 1,290 sq ft (120 m) by 100, for example, will tell you that you need to order at least 13 squares to get the job done.",
        "Always order 10% more materials than you think you need to account for waste, and round up to make sure you don't come up short.",
        "In the above example, you'd need 15 squares."
