Prepare a baking sheet by lining with parchment paper or a silicone sheet. Remove the banana peel. Slice the bananas into thin slices. Make sure they're all fairly much the same slice width, to ensure even cooking. Arrange the slices across the baking sheet. Arrange in a single layer and do not allow the slices to touch. Drizzle the freshly squeezed lemon juice over the top of all the banana slices. This helps to hold back natural blackening and adds a slight tang. Place the sheet in the oven. Bake for an hour to an hour and three quarters. Test after an hour to see if you like the consistency; if not, continue baking. Baking times may vary depending on the thickness of the slices.

Place in slightly salted iced water for 10 minutes (note that salt will melt the cubes faster but it'll stay cold). Slice the bananas thinly. Keep them as evenly sized as possible.

Use a slotted spoon to add and retrieve the slices. Remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper towels.  Make the sugar syrup. Add the two sugars, water and cinnamon to a heavy based saucepan. Cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves and thickens into a syrup. Turn off the heat source. Dip the fried bananas into the sugar syrup. Toss well to coat. Arrange on a wire rack covered in parchment paper. Let cool and set. Serve or store. Place in an airtight container for storage.
