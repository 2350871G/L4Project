The important thing in dressing warmly is that you are warm and fashion isn't the issue.

Preparing Your Clothing Dress in layers. When wearing multiple layers of clothing, warm air becomes trapped between each separate item. It is imperative to select the layers carefully to fully maximise the heat and to achieve constant comfort. Add the first layer.
