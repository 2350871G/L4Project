For your slaw, you\u2019ll want to use the entire head. Cut the cabbage into bite-sized sections to make it more manageable in the finished slaw. Place the prepped bok choy into a large mixing bowl as you go. Green bok choy, such as baby or Shanghai bok choy, are typically more tender and therefore better suited for uncooked dishes. Bok choy grows in the ground, so it tends to be dirty. Wash the heads thoroughly to rinse away any dirt or sediment before cutting them."
