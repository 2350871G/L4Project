The way you anchor the post will depend on the size of the fence, but in general, you need to make sure the post doesn't wiggle with weight. If it can be easily moved, the gate will sag. You should also check and see that the post is level, straight up and down. Ideally, a 4-foot (1.22 m) tall gate needs a 5\" x 5\" (12.7cm x 12.7 cm) redwood post. A 6-foot (1.83 m) tall gate requires a 6\" x 6\" (15.3 cm x 15.3 m) post. Post length should be at least 1/3rd longer than the planned height of gate. The hole that the post  will occupy should be at least 6\u201d deeper than post will be buried. Post should be buried at least 1/3 but preferably 1/2 of its length and hole should be 3 x as wide as post. Concrete is best for filling hole but gravel or tightly packed earth may have to do. It is best to seal the end of post being buried using old motor oil, water proofing agent, bronzing (lightly charring post) or exterior paint. Giving buried end of post some form of water proofing protection will greatly extend life of post. Post should also be (proved) before using. Proving is allowing post to lay exposed to elements for at least 4 or more days to assure that it won't warp or twist (the longer the better, 2 weeks is best). This is especially important for 'treated' posts that have been bundled (unbundle, separate posts and allow to dry and wait to see if they will remain straight -proving).

Whatever you choose to use, buy more lumber than you'll need to make sure you've got enough for the job. Building the Gate Cut 2 x 4 (5.08 x 10.16 cm) frame pieces to size with a mitre saw. Start the gate by cutting the top and bottom pieces to the same width/length as you planned for, slightly smaller than the opening in the fence. Cut the upright side planks about 3 inches shorter than the height of the gate. Screw in the top and bottom planks. Drill a pilot hole for the screws before putting them in so that they do not split the wood. Fasten with deck screws, pre-drilling to keep the wood from splitting.

Use a pencil to mark where the hinge should go on the post, and then put the gate down. Predrill where the screws will go. Prop up the gate and screw the hinges into the gate and attach the hinges to the post. Install a gravity latch. Most easy-to-use fences will use a gravity latch, which you can install after you've hung the fence. Mark where the screws will go with a pencil, then drill pilot holes and install the latch. Get the fit first before you put any finish on the gate. Seal the wood. Try to hit every exposed surface with your sealer, using a paintbrush or garden sprayer to apply.
