These plants can easily be found at your local garden center or nursery. The plants provide food for the caterpillars once they hatch from their eggs.

Female black swallowtail butterflies lay between 200 and 400 eggs, at the rate of 30 to 50 a day. So don't expect to only see a few \u2013 you'll likely see dozens. Check your plants frequently for pests. Ladybugs, wasps, and spiders will eat butterfly eggs if they find them before you do. Keep in mind that spraying your plants with pesticides will likely harm the butterflies as well.Tip: You may see clear or white spheres the same size as butterfly eggs.
