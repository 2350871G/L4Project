The paper towel will prevent the cracker from getting soggy. If you can't find any graham crackers, you can use another similar honey-cinnamon flavored cracker instead. Break off a piece of chocolate, and place it on top of the graham cracker. If you are using one of those large chocolate bars that have brick-like lines, use those lines as a guide. The chocolate should be a little smaller than the graham cracker. Place a marshmallow on top of the graham cracker. Stand it up on the flat side, so that it doesn't roll off when you move the plate. Do not place the other graham cracker half on top just yet; you will do that at the end. Microwave the s'more on high for 15 seconds.

Gently press down on the s'more to seal it. Press down hard enough so that the s'more sticks together, but not so hard that the marshmallow oozes out everywhere, or that the cracker breaks. Let the s'more cool a little before eating it. Because you did not heat the chocolate, you won't have to wait that long. A few seconds to a minute will be enough.
