How long this takes depends on how much water you put into the reservoir. In most cases, this will take about 5 minutes. Listen for the dripping noise from your coffee maker. Once it stops dripping, your coffee has finished brewing. Turn off the coffee maker and remove the filter. Some coffee makers automatically switch off while others do not. If your coffee maker is not an automatic one, you'll need to turn it off yourself once it stops dripping. Once the coffee maker has been turned off, pull out the filter and discard the grounds. Be careful when opening the coffee maker. Sometimes, it will release hot steam, which can burn you. Don't lean right over it. Remove the pot and serve the coffee. You can serve the coffee as-is, of you can sweeten it with milk, creamer, or half-and-half. For even sweeter coffee, add some sugar, maple syrup, or other sweetener. Enjoy the coffee immediately. If you are vegan or lactose-intolerant, try a non-dairy milk, such as soy, almond, or coconut. Be aware that flavored creamers and some non-dairy milk already come sweetened, so you won't need the extra sugar. Don't let the coffee sit too long. Not only will it grow cold, but it will also taste stale. Using a Percolator Fill the bottom chamber of the percolator with hot water. If you have not already, remove the top chamber and filter basket. Heat some water, then pour it into the bottom chamber of the percolator. Keep filling until the water level is just below the steam valve. A percolator is also known as a \"stovetop espresso maker\" or a \"moka pot.\" For best results, use filtered or bottled water. Add the filter basket, then fill it with coarsely-ground coffee. How much coffee you use depends on the capacity of the percolator. In most cases, there will be a fill line. Otherwise, use 1 to 2 tablespoons (7 to 14 g) of coffee for every 6 ounces (180 mL) of water. After you fill the filter basket, pat the coffee down. Screw the top chamber back on. Hold the percolator steady with 1 hand, then screw the top chamber back on. Be aware that the percolator may be hot from the water already, so it might be a good idea to handle it with an oven mitt or a pot holder. Heat the percolator on the stove over medium heat. Place the percolator on top of the burner. Turn the heat up to medium, and allow the water to get hot. Leave the lid off so you can observe the brew in progress, and remove when done. Make sure the handle is not directly over the heating element, be it gas or electric! Remove the percolator from heat once the coffee finishes brewing. As the water comes to a boil, coffee will begin to fill the upper section. It will start out dark, then lighten up as the brewing progresses. When the coffee stream becomes pale or blonde, it is ready. This entire process should only take about 5 minutes, but it may take longer/shorter. Replace the lid and pour the coffee into a mug. Once the upper chamber is pull, use an oven mitt or a pot holder to put the lid back on. Lift the percolator up by the handle, and pour out the coffee. Add some creamer or sugar, if desired, and serve immediately. The pot will be hot, so handle it with care! Making Coffee without a Coffee Maker Drape a tea towel to the top of a mug. Use your hand to tuck the handkerchief into the mug, creating a 3 to 4-inch (7.62 to 10.16-centimeter) deep pocket. You can also use a bandana, handkerchief, cotton fabric, or muslin fabric as long as they are clean. Make larger servings by placing the tea towel over a mason jar. You will need to increase the amount of coffee grounds and water later on, however. If the fabric has a loose weave, fold it into a square first. Secure the tea towel to the rim of your mug. You can use binder clips, paper clips, or clothespins. You will need at least two clips, one for each side, but four would be more secure. Alternatively, wrap a rubber band around the top of the mug, cinching the tea towel to it. Add medium-ground coffee into the tea towel. Freshly-ground coffee would work the best, but you can use pre-ground if you have nothing else. You will need 1 to 2 tablespoons (7 to 14 g) of coffee for each serving. The more coffee you add, the stronger the brew will be. Don't use finely-ground coffee, or the grounds will filter through the tea towel and get into the brewed coffee. Don't use coarsely-ground coffee. They will get clogged between the fine weave of the tea towel. Heat some water. It would be best if you heat the water to somewhere between 195 to 205\u00b0F (91 and 97\u00b0C). If this is not possible, simply boil some water, then let it sit off-heat for about 30 seconds. You don't want to use too-hot water, or it will spoil the taste of the coffee. Add the water gradually into the tea towel. Pour enough water to cover the coffee grounds. Wait 30 seconds, then add half of the water. Wait another 30 seconds, then add the rest of the water in 4 portions. Don't add the water all at once, or it won't drain fast enough and lead to overflow. Wait for the water to drain through, then serve the coffee. Once the water has finished draining, about 2 minutes, un-clip the tea towel and lift it out of the mug. Serve the coffee immediately, with cream and sugar, if desired. Discard the coffee grounds immediately and rinse the tea towel. Be aware that the ground coffee may stain the towel. Ensuring the Best Taste Buy freshly-roasted, good-quality coffee beans. There are different types of coffee beans, each coming from different regions. Some regions produce higher-quality coffee than others. For example, Arabica beans will be much higher in quality than robusta. You can buy pre-ground coffee, but if you want your coffee to taste better, grind the beans yourself. Only grind what you will use in a single brew. Ground coffee loses its freshness even faster than whole beans. Store the beans properly and use them within 1 week. Keep the coffee beans at room temperature in an airtight container, preferably glass or ceramic. Do not store the coffee in the fridge or freezer; this causes the coffee to absorb moisture and odors. If you must store ground in the freezer, use it within 3 to 5 months. Don't let ground coffee go to waste! If it lost its freshness, use it in a coffee scrub. Use a good-quality filter. Oxygen-bleached or dioxin-free paper filters work well. You can also use a long-lived, gold-plated filter instead. Avoid using a cheap filter, as it will affect the taste of the coffee. Paper filters will sometimes give your coffee a papery taste. To prevent this, run hot water through the filter first. Use filtered or bottled water. Don't use tap water, unless you know that your city has high-quality water. If you are going to use tap water, let it run for a few seconds before filling the pot; make sure that it is cold. Never use distilled or softened water. This will result in poor-tasting coffee. Make sure that the water is hot enough. The water need to be between 195 to 205\u00b0F (91 and 97\u00b0C). Water that is too hot or too cold will result in poor-tasting coffee. If you are not using a coffee machine, let the water come to a full boil first, then let it cool for 30 to 60 seconds before adding it to the coffee grounds. Serve the coffee soon after it finishes brewing. The longer you wait, the less-flavorful it will be. If you will be keeping it in a thermos, be sure to drink it within 1 hour. The longer coffee sits, the more stale it will become. Keep the coffee maker clean. Rinse the pot and the filter basket with hot water. Wipe it dry with a clean towel, then put it back together. This will prevent the build up of grounds and caffeol (coffee oil), which can make future cups taste bitter. Clean your coffee maker once a month with vinegar. Rinse it thoroughly afterwards.",
