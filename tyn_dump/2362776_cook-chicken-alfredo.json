Set it aside and place a colander in the sink. Carefully pour the pasta into the colander so the rest of the water drains. You'll use the reserved pasta water when you make the sauce.

Turn the chicken over so you can season the other sides as well. Cooking and Slicing the Chicken Heat the canola oil over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of canola oil into a large skillet or pot. Turn the burner to medium-high and let the oil heat until it shimmers. Avoid using a nonstick pan because it will prevent the chicken from developing a nice crust. Lay the chicken in the skillet and cook it for 5 to 7 minutes. Slowly lower the seasoned chicken breasts into the hot oil and leave them to cook without moving them around. Leaving the chicken undisturbed will help it develop a crisp brown crust. Flip and cook the chicken until it reaches 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). Use tongs or a spatula to flip the breasts over and put 1 tablespoon (14 g) of the butter in between them. Leave the chicken to cook undisturbed for another 5 to 7 minutes. To ensure the chicken is finished cooking, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of a breast.

This recipe is a more traditional alfredo sauce that uses heavy cream, but beginner cooks may have difficulty getting the sauce to thicken to their liking. If you'd prefer an easier option, you can make alredo sauce with cream cheese instead of heavy cream. Whisk in the cream, cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
