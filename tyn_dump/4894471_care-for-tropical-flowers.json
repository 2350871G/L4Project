        "For example, a healthy Mandevilla flowering vine will attach itself to a nearby trellis and cover it with foliage.",
        "You can purchase a wooden or metal trellis at your local gardening store.",
        "Bring your tropical flowers indoors for winter or cover them up.",
        "If your tropical flowers are potted, bring them into your garage or atrium to ride out the colder months.",
        "Other tropical plants, such as hibiscus, can generally survive outdoors unless temperatures drop below freezing.",
        "If it might freeze, place a blanket or bucket over your plants to minimize the damage from frost.",
        "You can also let your plants die out seasonally and simply replant in the spring.",
        "Prune back shoots in the fall or spring.",
        "Use a pair of gardening shears to clip back new growth or dead flowers during the more mild months of the year.",
        "Limit yourself to making only a few trims each time to not overly weaken your plant.",
        "This is an especially important step for potted plants, as it keeps them from outgrowing their containers."
