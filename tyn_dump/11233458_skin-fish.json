Follow along as close to the skin to save as much meat on the fillet as you can. If your knife is sharp, it will glide through the fillet with ease. Basically, you don\u2019t need to move the knife very much to cut a fillet. Fish meat is delicate and doesn\u2019t take much force to cut through. Check your progress when necessary by flipping up the fillet until the severed skin falls off of it."

Slide the tip of a small knife, such as a fillet knife, underneath the skin to remove it. You may also notice leftover bits of skin you missed during your first pass that can be removed now. The key to skinning a fish is making a single, consistent cut with smooth knifework. It gets easier with practice. The leftover bits happen when you pierce the skin. Small patches of skin can be tough to remove without butchering the meat, so you\u2019re often better off leaving them alone."
