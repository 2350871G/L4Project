However, there are specific times and seasons where the orbits of the Earth and Mercury place Mercury high above the horizon line. What months and at what times of the day Mercury is visible is entirely dependent on your location on Earth, but most calendars will divide viewing months and times into hemispheres. Mercury is best observed in the Northern Hemisphere during the evening in April and May, and during the morning in October and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, you can best observe Mercury about 2 hours before dawn in April and May. In June and July, look for Mercury in the evenings. Look up astronomical calendars online or go to your local bookstore and purchase a book on astronomy. Try using sites, like the Society for Popular Astronomy, or books, like Stargazing for Beginners."

Mercury is best observed with the naked eye during times right before and after the sun has set, which gives enough light pollution to contrast the shadow of Mercury. A general time to try and view Mercury with your naked eye is 90 minutes before sunrise or after sunset. If you find that the sky is still too bright to view with your naked eye, or not bright enough in the early morning, wait 10 minutes and try again."

However, a telescope will also prolong the amount of time you will be able to observe Mercury as it becomes gradually more difficult to observe during its crescent phases. To see the surface of Mercury you will need to magnify your telescope to 200x - 250x. Look online or at local cultural centers to find a stargazing club or group that owns a telescope.
