                    "description": "While Vaseline is not a moisturizer, it can be used to soften skin and lock in moisture on dry skin. You can use Vaseline as a spot-treatment for dry skin, especially during winter, helping to protect skin exposed to adverse weather conditions. Apply Vaseline to your elbows or knees to help moisturize the skin and rid the areas of any ashy texture or appearance. If you have callouses or rough spots on your feet, apply a thin coat of Vaseline at night then slip on some clean socks. Your feet should feel a bit softer the next morning. Apply a small amount on dry spots on your body before fake tanning lotions are applied. This will help to prevent uneven tanning. Use petroleum jelly after shaving. It can be used to smooth and soothe clean, freshly shaven skin."

As long as you\u2019re very careful to avoid getting petroleum jelly into your eyes, Vaseline is perfectly safe. Use a touch of Vaseline mixed with powder eyeshadow pigment to make new colors. Or, use it for a more solid eyeshadow that won\u2019t get all over your face when you put it on. Some people like to apply Vaseline under eye shadow to create a shiny effect. Vaseline can be used to tame unruly eyebrows, by brushing a small amount across them. Similarly, you can use Vaseline to define your lashes and leave them with a glossy and waterproof look. Apply a thin coat to your eyelashes before you go to bed. While unproven, many people think that Vaseline may help your eyelashes grow longer and thicker over time."

Condition the scalp with Vaseline pre-shampooing, massaging it gently into your scalp before a shower. Use Vaseline as a mask around the hairline when dyeing hair. It can protect against harmful hair dyeing, perming and straightening chemicals. In a pinch, a very small dab of Vaseline can be used in place of mousse or styling gel.
