Arrange 2 \u20444 pounds (1.2 kg) of skinless yellowtail fillets in the shallow dish and pour the lemon-garlic over the fillets so they're completely coated. Marinade the fish for 30 minutes at room temperature. Set the fish aside to marinate while you prepare the grill. Heat the gas or charcoal grill to medium-high. Turn on the gas grill or heat a chimney full of charcoal briquettes, if you're using a charcoal grill. Dump the briquettes when they're hot and ashy. Spread the ashes on 1 side of the grill grate to make a 2-zone fire. Lay the fish on the grill over direct heat. Remove the yellowfish from the marinade and lay the fillets on the grill so they're at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. If you're using the charcoal grill, place them directly over the coals. Grill the yellowfish for 2 minutes. Cover the grill and let the fish cook until it becomes brown on the bottom. You should be able to see grill marks. Flip and grill the fish for 2 more minutes. Lift the grill lid and use a fish spatula or tongs to flip each fillet over. Put the lid back down and grill the fish for 2 more minutes.
