Work in a combination of firm back-and-forth strokes and circular strokes to fully remove the varnish or finish from your wood.Tip: You can use an orbital sander if you want a cleaner, more uniform finish. You can rent one from your local hardware store. Use a 80-100 grit sandpaper disc and the lowest setting on your sander to cover the entire surface of the chair. Sanding your chair also removes any stains or dirt from the surface. Wrap the sandpaper around the legs, rails, and spindles and twist it to sand these thinner areas. You can also use a sanding brick instead of a sheet of sandpaper if you\u2019d like. If you use sheets, swap them out after the grit is worn down. It may take 2-3 sheets to fully cover larger chairs."

        "Get a can of spray primer from your local hardware or paint store.",
        "Choose white if you\u2019re planning on painting your chair a lighter color like white, yellow, or baby blue.",
        "Choose gray if you\u2019re going to paint your furniture a darker color like black, gray, or navy blue.Tip: You can use a liquid primer if you\u2019d like, but chairs tend to have lots of curves, small edges, and odd angles that will make using a brush or roller quite difficult.",
        "If you\u2019re painting the furniture primary red or blue, it\u2019s up to you on whether you want to use gray or white primer.",
        "White will make the colors brighter, while gray will mute the colors a little.",
        "Put on a pair of rubber gloves and dust mask.",
        "The fumes from spray paint are only dangerous if you\u2019re in an enclosed room, but they can be quite irritating, even outdoors.",
        "However, the fumes from aerosol primers are toxic.",
        "Protect your lungs by wearing a dust mask or respirator.",
        "Paint will also inevitably get on your index finger when you hold the nozzle down.",
        "Keep your hands clean by wearing a pair of rubber or latex gloves.",
        "If you absolutely have to work indoors, open the windows, turn fans on, and wear a respirator instead of a dust mask.",
        "Apply your first coat of primer to your chair.",
        "Apply your first coat of primer by holding the can 10\u201312 in (25\u201330 cm) away from the surface of the chair.",
        "Use back-and-forth strokes and work from the top down to cover the entire chair.",
        "Spray the chair from every angle to cover each side of the rails, spindles, and legs.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to spray under the rails, seat, and top bar of the chair.",
        "It\u2019s easy to forget about these parts when you\u2019re using spray primer.",
        "You can flip the chair over and paint the underside first if you want to, but you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.",
        "The first coat will look kind of clear.",
        "This is because the primer is soaking into the grain.",
        "This is a sign that you did a good job sanding, so don\u2019t worry about it.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to shake your can before using it.",
        "Wait at least 10 minutes before applying a second coat of primer.",
        "Give the chair at least 10 minutes to air dry so that the first coat of primer soaks into the wood.",
        "Then, once it\u2019s had time to settle, apply a second coat of primer in the exact same way that you applied the first layer.",
        "Hold the can 10\u201312 in (25\u201330 cm) away from the surface and use identical strokes to the first layer.",

        "Spray Painting Your Chair Get 3-4 cans of spray paint based on your desired finish.",
        "Go to your local hardware store and select a spray paint based on the color and type of finish that you want.",
        "While you can technically use any kind of spray paint to paint a wooden chair, look for cans that are designed specifically for furniture or interior design by reading the label carefully.",
        "Get a standard matte-finish paint for a sleeker, modern look.",
        "Matte paint absorbs light instead of reflecting it, so it\u2019s a good choice if you want a uniform, clean look.",
        "Semi-gloss paint is the most common option for furniture.",
        "It resists stains moderately well and creates a slight shine when light hits it.",
        "Gloss paint is usually reserved for furniture that will get really dirty\u2014like cabinets, doors, and countertops.",
        "If you want a ton of shine, go for gloss.",

        "Paint your legs by working from the top down.",
        "This way, any drips on the legs will accumulate on the underside of the seat where you won\u2019t notice them.",
        "You don\u2019t actually have to do this if you don\u2019t mind getting down on your knees and you have good control with a can of spray paint.",

        "Turn the chair over and finish the first coat by spraying back and forth.",
        "Turn the chair right-side up.",
        "Hold the can of spray paint 8\u201310 inches (20\u201325 cm) away from the surface of the chair.",
        "Start at the top of the chair and work your way down.",
        "Spray in horizontal strips and cover each section twice as you work down.",
        "Work around the entire chair while spraying to apply paint to the sides, and back of the rails, spindles, and legs.",
        "Your first coat should look semi-clear, regardless of the color that you\u2019re using.",
        "It will take multiple coats to achieve the color that you want.",
        "Wait 1 hour to give the chair time to air dry.",
        "After you\u2019ve applied your first coat, give the paint time to soak into the grain and settle.",
        "While spray paint can dry in as little as 5-10 minutes, it\u2019s better if you wait at least 1 hour so that the paint soaking into your wood grain has time to dry.",
        "If you want to test the paint to see if it\u2019s dry, try touching the underside of the seat.",
        "If it\u2019s dry, it will feel smooth to the touch.",
        "If it\u2019s wet, it\u2019s not a big deal since nobody will be able to see it under the seat.",
        "Repeat the painting and drying process until you\u2019ve reached your desired color.",
        "After you\u2019ve waited 1 hour, apply a second coat using the same color that you used for the first coat.",
        "Paint the underside first and then work from the top to the bottom.",
        "Use even, horizontal lines to work around the chair.",
        "After you\u2019re done, wait another hour before applying more coats.",
        "Paint the chair anywhere from 3-6 times until you\u2019ve reached the color that you want to achieve.Tip: If you have plenty of time, wait an extra hour for each additional coat.",
        "This will ensure that no moisture gets trapped in your lower layers of paint.",
        "Seal the chair with acrylic sealer to protect the paint.",
        "Get a liquid or aerosol sealer from your local craft or building supply store.",
        "If you have liquid sealer, fill a paint tray and use a natural brush to apply it to the chair.",
        "Use back-and-forth strokes and spread out any drips with an unloaded brush.",
        "If you have a spray sealer, apply it the same exact way that you spray painted your chair.",
        "Cover each surface and work around the chair to completely seal it.",
        "Wait 1 hour and then seal it again for maximum protection.",
        "The sealer will lock the paint into the wood and protect it.",
        "In the future, if you need to clean your chair, you\u2019ll be able to wash and wipe your chair without worrying about the paint rubbing off."
