To begin working your chains onto the hook, you will need to insert the hook through the first chain in your circle, then yarn over and pull the loop through.

You will need to keep repeating this process of adding and removing stitches until you have worked around the entire circle. Join the last two stitches with a slipstitch. When you reach the end of your first round, insert the hook through the top of the last stitch, yarn over and pull through the loops to secure the sides together. This will complete your first round of Tunisian crochet. Working Additional Rounds Insert the hook through the vertical bar. Your second round and all rounds after that one will be similar to the first, but slightly different. The main difference is that you will be inserting the hook into the vertical bar between the rows of your stitches. This bar is created as you work the basic Tunisian crochet stitch and it will be present in every row. Insert your hook into the first vertical bar to begin your second round. Yarn over and pull through. Next, loop the yarn over your hook and pull the loop through the vertical bar. This will complete your first stitch worked onto the hook.

Then, pull through two loops to remove stitches. Continue to yarn over and pull through two until you have removed the desired number of stitches. Remember to leave a few stitches on your hook. Do not remove all of them. Join the two ends with a slipstitch. When you get to the end of your round, then you will need to join the ends. Insert the hook through the first stitch in your round and yarn over. Then, pull through the first two stitches on your hook to secure the slipstitch. Make sure that you join the ends of each round using a slipstitch to ensure that your rounds are even. Continue to work around the circle until it is finished.

You can either weave in the tail using a yarn needle or tie it off again and cut the excess so that only about 1/2\" (1.3 cm) remains. Improving Your Results Keep the stitches straight. Any time you are working in the round, it is important to pay attention to the direction of your stitches and make sure that they do not become twisted. Check your chain when you are first starting the round and then check your work as you work the second round and beyond. This will help to ensure that your stitches are straight. Use a stitch marker to mark the beginning. Marking the first stitch with a stitch marker is a great way to keep track of where each round begins and ends. Place a stitch marker through the first stitch in your round and move the stitch marker up after each round. If you do not have any stitch markers, then you can use  paper clip, safety pin, or even a scrap of yarn looped through the stitch and tied in a bow. Place one ball of yarn on either side of you. Since Tunisian crochet requires alternating between two balls of yarn, you may easily end up with twisted strands if you keep them too close to each other. To prevent this from happening, place one ball on either side of you while you work. Leave a few stitches on the hook at all times. Although you need to remove stitches as you work the Tunisian crochet in the round, it is a good idea to always leave a few stitches on the hook. This will help to create a more seamless look and improve the appearance of your finished project.",
