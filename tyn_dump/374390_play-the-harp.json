                    "description": "When most people think of a harp, they either picture a large, golden pedal harp in an orchestra, or some type of harp being played by angels on a Christmas card. There are several types of harps, and they come in a variety of forms. The two most common styles of harp are lever harps and pedal harps. Lever harps have sharping levers at the top to change the notes. Pedal harps have seven pedals that can make notes flat, natural, or sharp. There are also wire-strung harps, double-strung harps, triple harps, Aeolian harps and other less common styles."

While you can play Celtic music on a pedal harp or a classical piece on a lever harp, these styles of harps are really different instruments for different purposes.

The pedal harp is loud enough to be heard in an orchestra, and its pedals makes it easier to play the notes classical music requires. It is big, relatively heavy, and has a complicated mechanism that needs periodic adjustment. The pedal harp is also one of the most expensive types of harps."

The lever harp is often softer and warmer in tone, and it is lighter and more portable. It is also much less expensive than a pedal harp.
