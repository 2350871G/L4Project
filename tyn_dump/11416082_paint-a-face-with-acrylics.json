                    "description": "For an acrylic portrait, you\u2019ll need bigger brushes for large areas of the skin and hair, and smaller brushes for the details, like the eyes and the lips. You may also want brushes made out of different types of hair, depending on the style you\u2019re going for. Bristle brushes make bold, distinct strokes, which can give your portrait an impressionist look. Sable brushes make smooth, blended strokes, which are good if you\u2019re aiming for something more realistic. Both bristle and sable brushes come in different shapes. Round brushes are good for outlining and making small details. Flat brushes can be used to create crisp edges and angles. Filbert brushes are effective at blending edges together. It\u2019s best to have a combination of different sizes, materials, and shapes available. This will give you more freedom while you paint."

Remember to thoroughly dry off your brushes with a paper towel after rinsing them to prevent water droplets from running down your painting. Mist the acrylics on your pallet with the spray bottle every so often so they don\u2019t dry out. This is important since acrylic paint dries quickly. You can also mix some water into your acrylic paint to thin it. Thinning acrylics can make them easier to work with and blend, but it\u2019s not necessary if you prefer the look of thick acrylic paint on the canvas."

There\u2019s no single recipe for mixing skin tone. Instead, you\u2019ll need to use a palette of several colors and experiment with mixing them together on your paint pallet until you get the right tone. For a color palette you can start with, use Titanium White, Cadmium Yellow Light, Burnt Umber, Ultramarine Blue, and Alizarin Crimson. Mix together two colors in your palette, then compare that color to your subject\u2019s skin tone. If it\u2019s too yellow, you might try toning it down with Burnt Umber. If it\u2019s too dark, you might add some Titanium White. For a cooler skin tone, you could add more Ultramarine Blue. Keep experimenting like this until you find the right skin tone. Squeeze paint on your pallet only when you\u2019re ready to use it so it doesn\u2019t dry out. Acrylic paints dry fast, so it\u2019s best to work with one color (or set of colors if you\u2019re blending) at a time. Only squeeze enough paint out of the tube as you can work with at once."

        "Then, add highlights and shadows to refine the shape of the nose and give it more structure.",
        "Generally, the skin on the nose will appear lighter on the bridge, tip, and edges of the nostrils, but reference your subject to find where the highlights and shadows fall on the face.",
        "Depending on the lighting and your subject\u2019s complexion, there may be other colors in the nose as well.",
        "For example, there could be a rosy hue at the tip of the nose.",
        "In that case, you could blend a little red into the skin tone color you created.",
        "Block in the hair using a larger brush, then add finer details.",
        "First, blend colors together until you achieve your subject\u2019s base hair color.",
        "Then, fill in the outline of the hair, including the eyebrows if they\u2019re the same color, with that color.",
        "Paint in the direction the hair flows in to give it a realistic movement.",
        "Once you\u2019ve blocked in the hair, add more layers of paint, including highlights and shadows that are visible in the hair.",
        "Alternate between different size and material brushes here to create the appearance of both thick clumps of hair and thin, individual strands.",
        "The more layers you add to the hair, the more dynamic and realistic it will look.",
        "Similar to skin, human hair can contain a variety of surprising colors, like blues, reds, and purples, depending on the lighting.",
        "Closely examine your subject\u2019s hair, and play around with adding different colors to help bring the hair to life.",
        "Finishing Your Portrait Paint the background of your portrait.",
        "Painting the background last allows you to create a crisp, clean background around the face you\u2019ve painted.",
        "Use a larger brush to fill in most of the background, then go around the edges of the hair and face with a smaller brush.",
        "When choosing a color for your background, you might go with a color that complements your portrait.",
        "For example, matching the background to the color of your subject\u2019s eyes may look nice.",
        "Alternatively, you can choose a contrasting color to really make your portrait pop.",
        "For example, if your subject has striking blue eyes, you could paint the background yellow to contrast them.",
        "Let your acrylic portrait dry for at least 1 week if you plan on applying varnish.",
        "Acrylics dry quickly, but it can take a week or even longer for all of the layers of acrylic paint in a portrait to dry enough for varnish.",
        "If you apply varnish before the paint is fully dry, it could look cloudy because of the moisture trapped underneath.",
        "If you\u2019re not varnishing your painting, it should be dry enough to touch within a few hours.",
        "Varnish your painting to protect it and enhance the colors.",
        "Varnishing isn\u2019t necessary, but it does help protect acrylic from dust, sun damage, and yellowing.",
        "It can also add a nice finish to your painting and bring out the colors.",
        "Just mix the varnish according to the instructions, and apply it to the surface of your painting with a brush.",
        "Then, let the varnish dry.",
        "You may need to apply multiple coats depending on the type of varnish you\u2019re using.",
        "You can purchase varnish at your local arts and crafts store."
