Some steroid creams\u2014like cortisone\u2014are available over the counter. For a stronger steroid, visit your doctor, and ask for a prescription to a steroid cream."

Don't pluck the hair out completely if you can avoid doing so; just make sure that the ingrown end is out of the skin. Sometimes you'll see a \u201cloop\u201d in the ingrown hair: the top of the hair where, instead of growing out through the skin, it curves over and grows down or sideways. This means that the tip of the hair has begun growing down into the skin. Try to pass the tip of a needle through the curve at the top of the ingrown hair and tug lightly. The end will often come loose. If you don't see the loop of the ingrown hair after exfoliating your skin and applying the warm washcloth, don't dig for the hair. You could damage your skin or draw blood. You can sterilize your tools by boiling them in water or by cleaning them with rubbing alcohol or running them through a hot flame until they turn bright red. If you heat them, let them completely cool before using them. Wash your hands before working on an ingrown hair and consider wearing nitrile gloves to prevent the spread of any bacteria."
