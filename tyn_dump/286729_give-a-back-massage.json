        "These movements have a stimulating, compressive effect on the tissue.",
        "Keep your wrists relaxed and flex at the wrists, using quick movements to perform tapotement techniques.",
        "This ensures that you don\u2019t apply too much pressure.",
        "Spend 2-3 minutes applying the techniques across the person\u2019s entire back.",
        "Use muscle-lifting techniques.",
        "To perform this, close your fingers and hold out your thumb (in a \u201clobster claw\u201d shape).",
        "Apply pressure in a twisting, lifting motion.",
        "Keep alternating hands in a \u201cwindshield wiper\u201d movement.",
        "Move up and down the back 2-3 times.",
        "Use a fanning technique.",
        "Position yourself at the head of the table.",
        "Position your thumbs at the top of the back, just below the neck and on either side of the spine.",
        "Using a \"fanning\" motion with your thumbs extended, push gently down toward the lower back with your pressure angled at the person\u2019s feet, not down towards the ground.",
        "Alternate your pressure on either thumb, moving from the top of the back all the way down to the person's hips.",
        "Make sure you are massaging the muscles on either side of the spine, not directly on the spine itself.",
        "Massaging over the spine can be very uncomfortable and dangerous if you are not trained properly.",
        "Apply twists.",
        "Come back around to the person's side.",
        "Reach around the far hip with one hand, while the other hand rests on the near hip.",
        "With a fluid motion, pull one hand towards you as the other one pushes away; in the middle, they should slide against each other, in opposite directions.",
        "Repeat this stroke up the back until you reach the shoulder area, then come back down.",
        "Repeat three times."
