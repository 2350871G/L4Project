In a nutshell, you'll insert the smaller container into the larger one, then install insulation material in the intervening space between the walls of both containers. Your storage containers don't have to be any specific size. A good standard pairing is around 30 gallons (110 L) for the larger container and about 18 gallons (68 L) for the smaller one. It may seem counterintuitive, but smaller shelters are actually preferable to large ones because it\u2019s easier for a cat to warm a tight space with its body heat."

        "This will create some airflow underneath the shelter and keep the floor from becoming uncomfortably cold.",
        "If you don\u2019t elevate your cat house, ground-chill can creep up and lower the temperature inside, making it harder for cats to stay warm.",
        "Cut a final piece of styrofoam to go on the top of the cat house.",
        "This piece should be big enough to lay over the edges of the wall pieces and close off the interior insulation.",
        "Now, all six sides of the shelter will be lined with a heat-retaining layer.",
        "Try to make sure there are no gaps or cracks in the top layer of insulation that could allow precious warmth to escape.",
        "Place the lid on the outer container.",
        "Now that your homemade insulated cat house is complete, all that\u2019s left to do is cover it up.",
        "Align the larger container lid with the edges of the outer container and press down firmly.",
        "Make sure it locks in place.",
        "Once you\u2019ve got the lid on, lay a few heavy objects, such a bricks, paver stones, or scrap lumber, on top to weigh down the shelter.",
        "It will then be safe from strong winds and inquisitive critters.",
        "For added security, use bungee cords or a few strips of duct tape to hold the lid on.",
        "Adding Basic Amenities Spread 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of straw over the floor of your cat house.",
        "Pile the straw up nice and thick all the way to the corners of the interior container.",
        "It will serve as a kind of bedding that cats can burrow in for added warmth and security.",
        "It may be easiest to remove the top from your cat house in order to put your straw bedding and other amenities in place.",
        "Straw is a more effective insulator than hay, as it\u2019s resistant to rot and mold and won\u2019t absorb excess moisture.Warning: Don\u2019t use blankets, towels, or newspaper to line your cat house.",
        "These may seem like good options, but they could easily get wet and make roosting cats even colder.",
        "Set a bowl of food in one corner.",
        "The cats who find their way into your shelter might be hungry as well as chilly.",
        "Kill two birds with one stone by pouring some well-balanced dry cat food into a dish and placing it inside the shelter, where it won\u2019t get rained on or eaten by other animals.",
        "Dry food is the most practical feeding solution.",
        "Since it doesn\u2019t spoil or dry out, it will stay fresh much longer than other types of food.",
        "Come back and check the amount of the food in the bowl every few days and refill it as needed.",
        "Leave a large container of water on the ground outside.",
        "Water containers should always be kept outside of the cat house.",
        "If they accidentally get turned over, they could soak everything inside, leaving it soggy and prone to mildew or even frost.",
        "Make sure you also select a non-breakable container to put water in, such as a small plastic tub or repurposed food container.",
        "That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about it breaking and possibly hurting a cat or any other animals.",
        "A heated water bowl will help ensure that the water you put out never freezes.",
        "You can usually find these at pet stores for around $20-30.",
        "Throw in some toys to provide a little entertainment.",
        "If you have any extra cat toys lying around at home, consider adding one or two in your cat house.",
        "They\u2019ll give visiting cats something to occupy themselves with while they wait out cold nights.",
        "Stuffed mice, hemp scratcher balls, and anything with feathers will offer hours of fun for feisty felines.",
        "Avoid toys with bells, squeakers, crunchies, or other noise-makers.",
        "These could attract the wrong type of attention from prowling predatory animals.",
        "Scatter some catnip around the door to lure nearby cats inside.",
        "No cat can resist the musky perfume of catnip.",
        "When they catch a whiff of the tantalizing scent, they\u2019ll come running, and discover a safe place to stay in the process.",
        "If there\u2019s a mouse toy in your cat house, stuff it full of catnip rather than sprinkling the herb onto the ground or bedding and making a mess.",
        "Some cats become aggressive when exposed to catnip.",
        "If you think it might cause a tussle, it may be best to leave it out."
