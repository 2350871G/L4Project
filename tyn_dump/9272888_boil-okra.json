Pat it dry with a clean kitchen towel, and use a sharp knife to cut the stems down to \u00bd-inch (13-mm). Place the okra in a large pot and cover it with water. Use a pot that's large enough to fit the okra so it doesn't occupy more than three-quarters of the capacity. Add enough cold water to the pot to just cover the okra.

Place the pot with the okra on the stove, and turn the heat to high. Allow the water to come to a boil, which should take about 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the vinegar into the pot. Once the water is boiling, add \u00bc cup (59 ml) of cider vinegar to the pot. Don't stir it in, though -- stirring can disturb the cooking process for the okra.

Finishing the Okra Drain the okra and return it to the pan. When the okra is finished cooking, remove the pot from the stove. Pour the contents through a colander to drain the water from the okra, and then put it back in the pot. Mix in the butter and pepper.
