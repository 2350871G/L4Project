Since you bake several cakes you can either stack them and frost them to make thick layers, or slice each cake in half horizontally to make even more thin layers."

Never try cutting or trimming warm cakes because they'll tear more. Cutting the Layers and Making the Frosting Trim away the excess dome from each cake. If your cakes baked faster in the center and domed up, you'll need to slice off the excess tops so each layer is even. Hold a serrated knife so the blade is horizontal and gently saw across the top of the cake so it's completely flat. Do this for each cake.

Assembling the Layer Cake Place the first cake layer on a cardboard cake round or turntable. Cut a piece of cardboard to the same size as your cake pan and set it on a turntable. Spoon a dab of frosting on the center of the cardboard then set the bottom layer of chilled cake directly onto it. Put the cake top or cut-side down. The frosting will anchor the cake layer in place. If you don't have a turntable, set the cardboard on your work surface or a cake plate. Spread frosting or filling over the bottom layer.

Continue to stack the cake layers and spread filling in between them until you've added all of your cake layers. Leave the top layer of cake unfrosted for now since you'll be covering the cake with a crumb coat. Frosting the Top and Sides Spread a thin crumb coat over the top and sides of the cake. Put a large dollop of frosting onto the top of the assembled layer cake. Use an offset spatula to spread the frosting across the top and sides of the cake. The crumb coat should be so thin that you can see through to the cake. The crumb coat will trap the crumbs in the thin layer of frosting.

        "Spread frosting or filling over the bottom layer.",
        "Spoon 1/2 cup to 1 cup (125 to 250 g) of frosting onto the cake layer.",
        "Use an offset spatula to spread the frosting evenly across the top of the layer, but don't try to frost the sides.",
        "If you prefer, you can use a piping bag to pipe the frosting onto the cake layer.",
        "If you're using a soft filling like a fruit curd or jam, pipe frosting around the edge of the cake layer.",
        "Then spread the filling.",
        "The frosting will prevent the soft filling from spilling out.",
        "Stack another layer of cake on top.",
        "If you're using a cake layer that you cut, lay it so the cut-side is facing down.",
        "It's fine if some of the frosting below the cake layer spills out over the sides.",
        "Spread frosting or filling over the layer.",
        "Add another 1/2 cup to 1 cup (125 to 250 g) of frosting or filling to the newest cake layer and spread it so it's evenly covered.",
        "Continue to stack the cake layers and spread filling in between them until you've added all of your cake layers.",
        "Leave the top layer of cake unfrosted for now since you'll be covering the cake with a crumb coat.",
        "Frosting the Top and Sides Spread a thin crumb coat over the top and sides of the cake.",
        "Put a large dollop of frosting onto the top of the assembled layer cake.",
        "Use an offset spatula to spread the frosting across the top and sides of the cake.",
        "The crumb coat should be so thin that you can see through to the cake.",
        "The crumb coat will trap the crumbs in the thin layer of frosting.",
        "This way, you can easily add frosting without getting crumbs in it.",
        "Chill the cake for 30 minutes and frost the top and sides.",
        "Put the cake in the fridge to chill until the crumb coat firms up.",
        "Then remove it and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.",
        "This layer of frosting should be much thicker than the crumb coat.",
        "Spin the cake turntable slowly as you work.",
        "This will make it easier to frost the sides of the cake.",
        "For very smooth sides, run a bench scraper against them so the frosting level is even.",
        "Chill the cake for at least 30 minutes.",
        "Place the frosted layer cake in the refrigerator and let it chill until the frosting sets.",
        "This will make it easier to pipe frosting or add other decorations without the frosting sliding or melting.",
        "You don't need to cover the cake as it chills.",
        "The frosting will prevent the cake from drying out.",
        "Decorate the cake.",
        "Once your cake has been completely frosted, pipe frosting embellishments on the top and sides.",
        "If you like, sprinkle cocoa or candy sprinkles over the top.",
        "Consider garnishing the cake with flaked coconut, mini-chocolate chips, or chopped nuts.",

        "Remove the flowers just before slicing and serving the cake.",
        "Transfer the cake from the turntable to a cake stand.",
        "Slide a cake lifter or large spatula under the cardboard base for your layer cake.",
        "Carefully lift it up in order to move the whole cake from the turntable.",
        "Set it down on your cake stand.",
        "Then slice and enjoy the layer cake.",
        "Use a chef's knife to slice the cake into pieces.",
        "Store the layer cake at room temperature for up to 3 or 4 days.",
        "For the best texture, cover the layer cake with an overturned bowl or plastic wrap and keep it at room temperature.",
        "If you'd rather refrigerate it, store it in an airtight container for up to 1 week and let it sit out at room temperature before you serve it.",
        "If your frosting has cream cheese or whipped cream, plan on refrigerating it instead of storing it at room temperature."
