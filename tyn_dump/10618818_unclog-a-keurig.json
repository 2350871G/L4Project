When you reinstall the coffee pod holder, notice the tab slots inside the Keurig. Align the tabs on the funnel with the slots to easily slide it into position. Clearing Sediment Clogs Manually Clear out the holes in the coffee pod holder with a paperclip. Straighten out 1 end of a paperclip to use as a cleaning tool. Then, examine the smaller end of the coffee pod holder. You will see several holes at the end of the funnel. Stick the end of the paperclip in the holes to clear out any coffee grounds there.

Squeeze the tube a few times to force out any dark-colored sediment stuck inside of it. Descaling with Vinegar Fill the water tank with equal amounts of water and vinegar. Drain the water reservoir if you already have water in it. Then, fill the tank half full with distilled white vinegar. Top up the rest of the tank with clean water. To avoid damaging the coffee maker, always dilute the vinegar with water. Never run pure vinegar through the machine. Keurig sells a commercial descaling product. It is effective, but it tends to be a bit pricey. If for some reason vinegar doesn\u2019t work, the descaling product is worth a try. Run the Keurig on a hot water setting. Set a big mug underneath the machine like you\u2019re going to brew some coffee. Start the machine on an ordinary hot brew setting. Let it run until it fills up the mug.
