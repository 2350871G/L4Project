Stir the mixture with a kitchen spoon or ladle vigorously for 15-20 seconds to mix it thoroughly. The milk will begin to thicken after 10 minutes. Let the milk mixture sit covered overnight at room temperature. This will allow the milk to coagulate and the curds to develop. Put the pot somewhere out of the way and make sure it is securely covered with the lid so that no contaminants can get in. Check the break between the curd and the whey the next morning. The milk will look gelled and some of the whey, or liquid, will have separated. Insert a clean finger or knife into the curd and slowly pull it out to see how the curd breaks. The curd should split neatly and the whey should look opaque. Draining and Molding the Cheese Curds Cut the curd into roughly \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) cubes. Start at one side and cut straight down to the bottom with a long-bladed knife. Make a rough grid pattern of cubes in the curd. The cheese curds will move around as you cut them, so don\u2019t worry about making each one a perfect cube. Reach to the bottom with a clean hand and gently lift the curds to stir.

To make a homemade cheese mold, cut the ends out of a smooth-sided 4 x 5 inch tin and save one of the cut ends. You can use a sterile handkerchief instead of cheesecloth in the mold. Brining and Storing the Feta Prepare pickling whey brine and let it sit for 12-24 hours. Mix 20 oz (591 ml) of the whey that you saved with 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of salt and stir to dissolve. Let the whey brine sit out at room temperature, covered, for 12-24 hours to make it acidic. The brine must be acidic or else the cheese will melt on the surface. Cut the cheese into 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) cubes and put them in a wide jar. Place the cheese on cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it evenly. Leave a bit of space at the top of the jar because you will cover the cheese with brine. A mason jar is a good option for storing your homemade feta. Pour brine into the jar with the cheese to cover it. Let the cheese age for 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Always store the cheese in the refrigerator and keep it submerged in brine. The feta will stay good for up to 1 year as long as you keep it in the fridge and in brine. The cheese will become drier and more easy to crumble with time.",
