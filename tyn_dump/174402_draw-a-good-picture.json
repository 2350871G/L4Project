Most craft and art stores sell drawing pencils. The best drawings use a variety of pencil shades. The higher the number, the darker you can go. For example, 6B is much darker than 2B. If you want a really light line use an H pencil. The higher the number the lighter the line. For example, 6H is much lighter than 2H."

Paper that is rougher, with a higher tooth, will collect more graphite for deeper shading, but the texture will show through and it may be difficult to add details and polish to your art. Paper that is very smooth, like Bristol board, will make for a cleaner looking finished product and an easier time adding small detail. However, it may make it impossible to get darker shades without \u201cburnishing\u201d the graphite. Burnishing comes from smoothing the surface of the paper with the pressure of the pencil until it becomes  reflective and appears light rather than very dark. If this is a problem for you, choose softer pencils and don\u2019t press down as hard."

Never rest any part of your hand on any part of your paper that has pencil on it. In other words never rest your hand on your actual drawing. Try to keep your hand on the blank parts of the paper. This prevents blurring your lines. Lay a piece of scrap paper between your hand and the art if you need to work on an area that isn\u2019t near any blank space. Wear gloves.
