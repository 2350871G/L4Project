        "Rinse the surface with clean water when you\u2019re finished clean it to remove any soap residue.",
        "Wait at least 1 hour to let the surface fully dry.",
        "Moisture can affect the way the paint adheres to, so it\u2019s very important to wait for the surface to fully dry before you begin painting.",
        "Check after 1 hour to see if it is fully dry by touching the surface with your hand.",
        "You can use a cloth to soak up any water on the faux brick, but it still needs to air dry completely.",
        "Applying Paint to a Faux Brick Surface Use a semi-gloss enamel paint for a durable finish on faux brick.",
        "The texture of faux brick surfaces can make paint prone to flaking off over time, and the enamel in the paint will help to prevent the paint from chipping.",
        "When you\u2019re choosing the paint you want to cover your faux brick with, choose a semi-gloss enamel paint for a long-lasting finish.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for more of a weathered look, or you want your faux brick to show through the paint, you can use all purpose white drywall primer as your paint.",
        "Fill the paint tray reservoir with paint.",
        "A paint tray is a plastic receptacle with a slope and indentations to allow you to add paint to a paint roller and remove the excess paint by running the roller over the indentations.",
        "Add your paint to the reservoir of the paint tray before you paint, taking care not to overfill it.",
        "Use a nap roller to apply a base coat of paint.",
        "Roll the the nap roller through the paint and remove the excess by running the roller over the textured part of the tray.",
        "Start at one of the bottom corners and roll the paint onto the surface in slightly angled, upwards strokes, working in 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) wide sections to cover the surface.",
        "Use a nap that is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.",
        "Sweep the roller up and down to fill in the unpainted gaps.",
        "After you\u2019ve covered most of the faux brick with angled strokes, use smooth, continuous up and down motions to cover any spots that were missed.",
        "Work within 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) wide sections to ensure even coverage.",
        "After you fill in one section, apply more paint to your roller and move on to another section.",
        "The up and down strokes should slightly overlap each other to make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps.",
        "Let the paint dry overnight.",
        "The baseline coat is critical to ensure complete coverage of the faux brick surface, and must be allowed to dry fully before any additional layers are added.",
        "Allow the surface to dry fully by letting it dry overnight or for 12 hours.",
        "You can use a fan to help speed up the drying process.",
        "Apply another layer of paint to the faux brick.",
        "After your base coat has fully dried, use your nap roller to put on another coat of paint.",
        "Work in similar 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) wide sections, rolling the paint on in angled, upwards strokes.",
        "Then fill in any gaps by sweeping the roller up and down over the surface to apply more paint evenly.",
        "Allow the faux brick to dry for 12 hours.",
        "After you\u2019ve applied your layers of the paint, let the faux brick dry completely before deciding if you need to add any additional layers.",
        "You can wait overnight or for 12 hours.",
        "Leave a fan blowing on the faux brick to help it dry faster.",
        "Be sure to test the paint by touching a small section to make sure that it has completely dried.",
        "You can add additional layers if you want to cover the faux brick more.",
        "Creating a Faux Brick Wall Choose a gray or beige matte enamel paint as your base color.",
        "To create a faux brick wall, you\u2019ll first need a baseline color to serve as the mortar and give the appearance of grout lines when you paint your bricks.",
        "A matte enamel gray or beige works well for even coverage and to provide a backdrop for your brick accents.",
        "Use a nap roller to apply a base coat using angled, upwards strokes.",
        "Start applying the paint about 12 inches (30 cm) from the bottom of the wall and stop about 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) from the ceiling.",
        "Work in sections about 3 feet (0.91 m) wide and roll the paint onto the wall in smooth, even strokes for full coverage.",
        "Apply more paint to the roller as needed, but be sure to remove the excess paint by running the roller over the ridges in the paint tray.",
        "Complete the base coat by sweeping the roller up and down.",
        "Work in 3 feet (0.91 m) sections, filling in the gaps completely before moving to another section.",
        "The paint strokes should slightly overlap to make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps.",
        "Be sure to paint the space between the bottom of the wall and the ceiling and any corners, too.",
        "Let the paint dry fully dry overnight or wait for 12 hours.",
        "Before you add your brick accents, the base coat needs to be completely dry.",
        "Otherwise, the two paints could mix together and form splotchy bricks with paint clumps.",
        "Leave the wall to dry overnight or wait 12 hours before testing a small section of the wall by touching it to see if the paint is fully dry.",
        "Point a fan directly at the wall to make it dry faster.",
        "Apply painter\u2019s tape to your wall to act as a stencil.",
        "Peel off long strips of the tape and apply them to the wall vertically, then peel long strips and apply them to the wall horizontally to form a grid pattern.",
        "The tape will form the gutter or \u201cgrout\u201d by keeping the base coat free from your \u201cbrick\u201d color.",
        "The size of the rectangles in your grid will be the size of your \u201cbricks,\u201d so apply your tape to the wall to form bricks that are the size you want them to be for your wall.",
        "When you peel the tape off after painting the wall, it won\u2019t leave any residue behind and will form even lines.",
        "Use an earthy red or brownish matte enamel paint to imitate brick.",
        "When you\u2019re choosing your paint color, go with one that looks like a natural brick color.",
        "A simple matte paint will work great to form your bricks and can simulate a weathered or distressed brick aesthetic.",
        "Choose the same type of paint that you used as a base color so the two paint colors appear to be part of the same material.",
        "Fill the reservoir of the paint tray with your brick paint color.",
        "Make sure the paint tray is cleaned out of any previous paint that may have been used so there isn\u2019t a mixing of the colors.",
        "Fill the reservoir with the paint you plan to form your bricks out of, but be sure not to overfill the tray.",
        "Leave the ridges used to remove excess paint from the paint roller exposed in case you need to use them.",
        "You don\u2019t need as much paint as you did for the base coat.",
        "Fill the reservoir with about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of paint.",
        "Dip a large sponge into the mixture and apply the paint to the wall.",
        "A large, rectangular sponge measuring about 8 inches (20 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) high will help make the work of forming bricks really easy.",
        "Lightly dip one side of the sponge into the brick paint color and dab it into the square formed by your painter\u2019s tape.",
        "Use the other side of the sponge to wipe up any excess paint.",
        "Soak the sponge in clean water and wring it out before dipping it into the mixture so it\u2019s already dampened to prevent the paint from clogging up the sponge.Tip: For a more distressed look, lightly dab the paint onto the wall.",
        "Continue to apply your \u201cbricks\u201d to your wall until you fill the entire wall.",
        "Repeat the process of dipping the sponge into the paint and pressing it onto your wall to form your bricks until you have filled the entire wall and painted each rectangle of the grid.",
        "Make sure you\u2019ve applied an even coat of paint to each of your \u201cbricks\u201d so that they appear consistent.",
        "Allow the paint to dry 12 hours before removing the painter\u2019s tape.",
        "When you are finished applying your faux brick paint, let the paint dry completely by waiting overnight or allowing 12 hours for the wall to dry.",
        "You can then remove the painter\u2019s tape by starting at one end and slowly peeling the tape off.",
        "Test the paint by touching it to make sure it\u2019s fully dry before you remove the tape."
