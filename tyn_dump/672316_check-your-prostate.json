The Unites States Preventive Task Force advises against prostate screening with PSA levels due to these risks. Ejaculation (recent sexual activity), prostate infection, digital rectal examination, and bike riding (due to pressure on the prostate) can cause elevations of PSA. Those without prostate symptoms and elevated PSA may require repeat testing after two days. Repeat elevated PSA levels may warrant a DRE and/or biopsy of the prostate (needle inserted to take a piece of the prostate tissue for analysis) if symptoms are present. Men with a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every two years whereas screening should be done yearly if your PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher."
