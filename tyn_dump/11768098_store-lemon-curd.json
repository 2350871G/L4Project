Put the lid on the canner and set a timer for 15 minutes once the water is boiling.If you\u2019re at an altitude above 1,000 feet (300 m), change the processing time to 20 minutes. For altitudes over 6,000 feet (1,800 m), process the lemon curd for 25 minutes. Remove the jars from the canner and let them cool for 12-24 hours. If you have a jar lifter, simply clamp it around the lid of a jar and carefully pull it out of the water bath. If you don\u2019t have a jar lifter, use silicone tongs or something similar. Place the jars on a towel and let them rest upright so the lids can properly seal.You\u2019ll know the lids have sealed when they no longer flex or move when you push on the top. If the lid still moves or buckles when you press on it after 24 hours, store your lemon curd in the fridge and use it within 3-4 weeks. Store the lemon curd in a cool, dark place for 3-4 months. Place the curd on a shelf or in a pantry away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Use a piece of masking tape to label each jar with the \u201cdate made\u201d to mark how long they\u2019ve been in storage.If you notice any separation or discoloration in the curd, throw it away.

Add 1 stick of cold unsalted butter and blend the ingredients until it\u2019s in pea-sized bits. Add 1 egg yolk, 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of heavy cream, and \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of vanilla extract and pulse the mixture until everything combines. Press the dough into a tart pan, then chill it for 1 hour before pricking the bottom with a fork several times and baking at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 10-12 minutes. Fill the baked crust with fresh lemon curd when you\u2019re ready! Fold lemon curd into cream cheese to use as a dip for fresh fruit.
