The easiest way to tell the difference between a Greek and Irish bouzouki is to look at their shape. A Greek bouzouki has a bowl-shaped back, while the back of an Irish bouzouki is flat. You can also look at the scale length of your instrument to determine whether it\u2019s a Greek or Irish bouzouki. A Greek bouzouki will have a longer scale, measuring around 680mm (about 27 inches), while an Irish bouzoukis scale length measures around 530mm (about 21 inches)."

Six-string bouzoukis are typically tuned to the pattern of D-A-D. Eight-string bouzoukis are typically tuned to the pattern of C-F-A-D. Tuning by Ear Tune one string at a time. You will need to tune each string separately to get your bouzouki back in tune. Hold the bouzouki as you would while playing it.

Strum them together to hear any differences and adjust if needed. Check your tuning. After tuning all courses on your bouzouki, strum through the open strings again to check that everything is tuned properly. For the best results, also check each course separately.

Each course needs to be tuned separately. Hold your bouzouki like you\u2019re about to play it, and start by tuning the bottom string course, gradually working your way up. Set the note on your tuner each time you tune a course. Unless you have a \"bouzouki\" setting on your digital tuner, you will need to set the desired note on the digital tuner when tuning each course. Look for a \u201cpitch\u201d button or refer to your tuner\u2019s instructions to change the note on your tuner. The bottom course will need to be tuned to the corresponding note just above Middle C. For both six-string and eight-string bouzoukis, this would be the D above Middle C (d' or D4). Set your digital tuner to that note.

Test the string after each adjustment by plucking it and referencing your digital tuner. Once you\u2019ve successfully tuned the string, repeat the process to tune the other string in the course. Repeat the tuning process on each course of your bouzouki. After you tune the lowest course, set a new note on your digital tuner and adjust the next course up. Continue until all of the courses on your bouzouki have been tuned. Check your tuning.
