Drywall is sold in multiple sizes: 4 x 8 feet (1.2 x 2.4 m), 4 x 10 feet (1.2 x 3 m) and 4 x 12 feet (1.2 x 3.6 m) are the most common. The 4\u2019 x 8\u2019 is the easiest to handle and works well for most jobs. 4.5\u2019 width sheets are also available at commercial supply houses. Sheetrock will cost just a few dollars per sheet for the 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) thickness. This is the average thickness, which works well for most uses. Haul the sheetrock home flat, for example in the bed of a pickup truck, so it doesn\u2019t break or bend while transporting. If you must store the sheets for more than a few days, store them flat and on top of each other so they do not warp or get their corners broken."

You will need a utility knife and spare blades, a hammer (or drywall drill if you screw the sheets to the wall), a straight edge for cutting and measuring (they make drywall T-squares just for this), and plenty of special drywall nails or screws. Drywall can be installed using nails or screws. With nails you end making larger \u201cdivots\u201d because the hammer face is large. These are easily filled later, but require just a little more patience when taping. Screws are the \u201cinstrument-of-choice\u201d for professionals these days. No professional drywall installer leaves home without a screw gun. You might also consider getting a drywall foot-lift. Your drywall is usually installed 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) above the ground. A lift, or a drywall hammer in a pinch, will help you prop up the drywall as you nail it to the studs."
