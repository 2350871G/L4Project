It's easy to make your own ant baits. A particularly effective one is made with boric acid. Boric acid and sodium borate salts are naturally found in minerals like sassolite. When ants walk in or over boric acid, they ingest it and die. Boric acid is poisonous and should not be ingested or come in contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Handle it with gloves. A sample boric acid bait could be made with boric acid and maple syrup. Drizzle a spoonful of syrup on a plate or saucer. Sprinkle this liberally with boric acid. Use a skewer, toothpick, or cotton swab to distribute the acid evenly through the syrup. Place your boric acid bait wherever the ants are frequenting. Keep it out of the reach of children or pets.

        "Using a Professional Exterminator Verify the exterminator uses natural pesticides.",
        "Some exterminators specialize in using natural pest control methods.",

        "This kind of pest control is often poorly regulated.",
        "Some pest services are only \"organic\" or \"natural\" in name, but not in fact.",
        "Call exterminators and inquire directly about services, saying something like, \"Could you tell me how your methods are all natural?\"",

        "Repeat this process every day or so until it seems that the ants have given up and moved.",
        "This may take several days to take effect."
