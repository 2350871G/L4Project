        "Refer to the manufacturer's instructions.",
        "Remove any diaper inserts, such as a soaking pad, before you wash them.",
        "Refer to the instructions included with the specific type of disposable diaper you're using.",
        "In virtually every case, though, if the diaper has more than one component, separate them before washing.",
        "Run the diapers through a cold rinse cycle first.",
        "This will help prevent stains from setting in, and will rinse out most of the urine.",
        "Don't add any detergent yet.",
        "You can do this rinse by hand if necessary.",
        "Follow up with a hot wash and extra rinse cycle.",
        "If possible, use a laundry soap that is marketed specifically as cloth diaper-friendly.",
        "Most eco-conscious brands will do, since they usually lack the fragrances and enzymes that can cause residue buildup on the cloth.",
        "Such residues can cause cloth diapers to leak.",
        "Check to see if your diaper manufacturer recommends any specific detergents.",
        "If necessary, add an oxygenated bleach, not chlorine bleach.",
        "Also, instead of adding a residue-creating fabric softener, you can (if desired) add white vinegar to the wash. Dry the diapers completely before using them again.",
        "It may be possible to put some cloth diaper types in the dryer, but it's always preferable to air dry them if you can.",
        "The diapers will last longer this way, and your dryer won't be using up electricity and/or gas.",
        "PUL (polyurethane laminate) covers always need to be air dried.",
        "Check the care instructions for your particular diaper brand.",
        "Wool covers must be hand washed in cold water and air dried.",
        "Choosing the Right Cloth Diapers Test a few options before you buy a batch of cloth diapers.",
        "Cloth diapers come in many different forms and with many unique features.",
        "Talk to other parents who've used cloth diapers for their insights \u2014 even see if you can borrow a few samples to try out.",
        "Ask other parents questions like \"Which of these did you find prevents leaks better?\"",
        "or \"How hard is it to undo and re-do these snaps if the baby is fussy?\"",
        "Just as no two babies are exactly alike, no single diaper type is best for every baby.",
        "The only sure way to know what works best in your case is to try out several types.",
        "Try all-in-one diapers (AIOs) first if you're used to disposables.",
        "AIO are the closest reusable analogue to disposable diapers \u2014 you just wash them instead of tossing them.",
        "They are made with the absorbent cloth inside next to your baby's skin, and a PUL (polyurethane laminate) cover attached to the outside.",
        "Use pre-fold diapers for simplicity and classic appeal.",
        "These are the diapers that your great-grandmother would most easily recognize.",
        "Pre-folds are rectangular in shape and divide by length into three sections.",
        "Follow the included directions and markings that show you how and where to fold the diaper.",
        "Use a \u201csnappi\u201d (a flexible plastic harness with gripping \"teeth\") to hold the diaper together (or, if you insist, safety pins), or place a diaper cover that snaps over it.",
        "Try a pocket diaper for extra protection against wetness.",
        "This type of diaper has become increasingly popular in recent years, though it isn't necessarily any easier to deal with than other cloth diapers.",
        "These diapers have a waterproof exterior and a pocket where you put the removable insert, which will be either washable or disposable.",
        "Shop for extra inserts (also called soakers) of various thicknesses.",
        "Thicker inserts provide the baby with extra protection for nap and nighttime.",
        "If fashion plays into your decision-making, pocket diaper exteriors often come in a wide range of colors and patterns.",
        "Use a fitted cloth diaper for heavy wetters.",
        "These diapers can be perfect for nighttime because the front, back, and side tabs hold pee in spots where some other reusable types don't.",
        "They usually fasten with snaps or hook-and-loop (e.g., Velcro) closures, and are easy to take on and off.",
        "Fitted diapers need a waterproof cover.",
        "Wool diaper covers are great for nighttime use instead of a PUL cover.",
        "Just be sure to read about washing and applying lanolin to waterproof them.",
        "Stocking Up without Overdoing It Buy enough diapers to last 2 or 3 days.",
        "A typical newborn requires 10 to 12 changes per day, and older infants and toddlers often need 8 to 10 changes.",
        "If you're switching to cloth from disposable diapers, count your average daily diapers used over several days.",
        "You won't need more than three days' worth of diapers, because by that point your diaper pail will be overflowing with dirty diapers waiting for a wash. Expect to wash diapers every other day.",
        "Never leave dirty diapers unwashed for more than three days.",
        "Purchase some disposable diapers to supplement your reusables.",
        "While it's a noble goal to completely eliminate the use of disposables, they are nice to have around in certain cases.",
        "For instance, you may unavoidably fall behind on your diaper washing and need a quick, clean option.",
        "Or, you may need to use a babysitter or daycare center that's more comfortable with (or requires) disposables.",
        "You may think you'll need to use disposables when you're away from home (for instance, when out shopping), but it's really not any more difficult to use cloth diapers when on the road.",
        "Just make sure to bring along a dirty diaper storage bag that seals securely (you can purchase these alongside cloth diapering supplies).",
        "Seek out secondhand cloth diapers.",
        "Don't get grossed out by the thought of using another baby's old diapers.",
        "Look at it like using secondhand baby clothes \u2014 if they're clean and in good shape, they're perfectly safe and fine to use.",
        "If, however, they're heavily stained, torn or frayed, or any of the snaps or other closure mechanisms are worn or damaged, don't use them.",
        "Play it safe and wash the diapers yourself before using them.",
        "Pay attention to sizing.",
        "Just as with disposables, most reusable diapers come in different sizes based on the baby's age and weight.",
        "Use age as a general guideline, but focus primarily on the weight category in order to get the best fit for your child.",
        "Regular leaks are a good sign that the diapers you're using are either too big or too small.",
        "Some cloth brands offer a \"one-size\" diaper that will fit from right after the newborn stage until potty training.",
        "These can save you money (because they'll fit longer), but may not necessarily provide the same level of fit and leak protection.",
        "Try one out and see how it works for you.",
        "Buy necessary accessories.",
        "These include diaper covers, extra inserts, diaper liners, \u201csnappis\u201d or pins, cloth diaper-safe rash cream, and a pail or bucket with a lid to store the dirty diapers.",
        "Keep in mind the two-to-three day diaper supply plan.",
        "This means you don't need a box full of diaper pins or a giant pail that could hold a week's worth of diapers.",
        "Consider repurposing cloth diapers after your baby's done with them.",
        "Some parents use them for burp cloths, bibs, and changing pads, among many possibilities.",
        "Or, lend, give, sell, or donate them so someone else can become a cloth diaper convert!"
