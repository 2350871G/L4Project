        "Harvest after the first frost for sweeter rose hips.",
        "After a frost, the cell walls of the rose hip start to break down, so the fruit becomes sweeter and softer.",
        "This is the time when rose hips are considered to be at the peak of their flavor.",
        "Don't wait too long after the frost, or the rose hips will start to develop brown spots.",
        "Pinch the rose hips at the top and bottom to remove the green parts.",
        "The place where the rose hip was attached to the stem and, at the other end, the flower, should both come off of the fruit easily if you pinch and twist the green part at either end.",
        "Rinse the rose hips in cold water.",
        "Although you shouldn\u2019t use rose hips which have been treated with non-organic chemicals, it\u2019s still a good idea to wash them in case there were any impurities in the environment, including those caused by pollution, bugs, or wild animals.",
        "Sort the rose hips and discard any which are blemished.",
        "Look for rose hips which are cracked, soft, or which have brown spots or other blemishes, and toss them out.",
        "These may be spoiled or contaminated by insects.",
        "The best way to do this is to examine them while you are drying them.",
        "Drying Rose Hips Cut each rose hip in half.",
        "Hold the rose hip between your thumb and forefinger on a flat surface, then use a small paring knife to carefully slice the rose hip in half.",
        "Some people prefer to scoop the seeds out of the rose hips at this time in order to remove the hairs.",
        "However, this is time consuming, and it\u2019s not necessary if you sift the rose hips after they\u2019re dry.",
        "In addition to being easier, this technique preserves the seeds, which have their own nutritious benefits.",
        "Spread your rose hips on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.",
        "Try to spread your rose hips in a single, flat layer.",
        "If the rose hips are sitting on top of each other, the fruit on the bottom layer will not be able to dry, so be sure they are laying in an even, single layer.",
        "The parchment paper will help to wick moisture away from the rose hips as they dry.",
        "Leave the rose hips in a dark, well-ventilated area for about 10 days.",
        "Your rose hips will dry best if they are out of direct sunlight.",

        "If you need to dry them faster, you can put them in the oven on the lowest setting or you can use a food dehydrator.",
        "Sift the dried rose hips in a sieve to remove the hair.",
        "The hairs inside of rose hips are highly irritating to people\u2019s skin, mouths, and digestive systems, so you\u2019ll want to sift your dried rose hips to remove them.",
        "Place them in a fine sieve, then shake or tap the sieve so the fine hairs fall through.",
        "Seal the dried rose hips in airtight containers or glass jars.",
        "If properly stored, your dried rose hips should last anywhere from 4 months to 1 year.",
        "The cooler the storage environment, the longer they will last.",
        "If you want your rose hips to last for up to 2 years, try putting them in the freezer.",
        "Infusing Rose Hips into Vinegar Prick 10-12 fresh rose hips all over with a pin.",
        "When infusing vinegar with rose hips, you\u2019ll want to leave the fruit whole.",
        "Using a small pin, poke little holes all over the fresh rose hips so the vinegar can easily penetrate the fruit.",
        "Try not to crush the fruit, as this will allow the hairs from the rose hip to get into the vinegar.",
        "You\u2019re going to strain the vinegar at the end of the process, though, so don\u2019t worry if it isn\u2019t perfect.",
        "Add the rose hips to a bottle with a tight cork.",
        "You may need to add the rose hips one at a time if the bottle has a narrow neck.",

        "Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of cold white wine vinegar over the rose hips.",
        "White wine vinegar is, as the name suggest, made from white wine, lending a subtle yet distinctive flavor to this infusion.",
        "While you can experiment with different vinegars if you like, such as apple cider or balsamic vinegar, the delicate tangy flavor of white wine vinegar balances the tart rose hip flavor the best.",
        "Let the mixture sit for about 4-6 weeks, shaking occasionally.",
        "Keep the bottle closed tightly while the rose hips infuse into the vinegar.",
        "Once or twice a week, give the bottle a vigorous shake to help the flavors mix evenly.",
        "It's best to store the mixture out of direct sunlight.",
        "Pass the mixture through a strainer to remove any hairs.",
        "Hold a fine mesh strainer over a second jar or bowl, then slowly pour the vinegar through the strainer and into the second container.",
        "This should capture any stray seeds or hairs.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a strainer, you can strain the vinegar through a coffee filter.",
        "Return the mixture to the original container after you have rinsed it.",
        "Rinsing the original container will ensure there are no irritating hairs left on the inside of the bottle.",
        "If you like, you can strain the mixture a second time as you pour the vinegar back into the bottle.",
        "Store your rose hip vinegar in a cool, dark place.",
        "The shelf life of white wine vinegar is almost indefinite, so your rose hip vinegar could last 5-10 years or more.",
        "Keep it away from fluctuating heat or direct sunlight to help preserve the flavor.",
        "Preserving Rose Hips in Jelly Boil 2 quarts (1.9 L) of rose hips in 6 cups (1,400 mL) of water for 1 hour.",

        "Place the rose hips and 6 cups (1,400 mL) of water into a large stock pot and bring it to a rolling boil.",
        "Stir the mixture occasionally with a long-handled spoon, taking care to avoid the steam.",
        "Pour the mixture through a strainer or cheesecloth.",
        "Have a second pot or large bowl handy.",
        "Once you remove the rose hips from the stove, pour the mixture through your strainer or cheesecloth into the second container.",

        "Measure the rose hip juice to be sure you have 3 cups (710 mL).",
        "Once you have finished straining your mixture, you should have about 3 cups (710 mL) of juice left.",
        "This is the amount you will need to make your jelly.",
        "If you don\u2019t have enough juice, add water, or pour boiling water through the jelly bag until you have enough juice.",
        "Mix your rose hip juice, lemon juice, and pectin in a large, wide pot.",
        "If you like, you can use the pot you used earlier in the process.",
        "Add the 3 cups (710 mL) of rose hip juice, \u20442 cup (120 mL) of freshly-squeezed lemon juice, and 1 package of prepared pectin, which is usually 1.75 ounces, or 49 grams.",
        "Stir them together with a long-handled spoon until they are fully blended.",
        "Bring the mixture to a boil, dissolving all of the pectin, then add the sugar.",
        "Heat the mixture until it\u2019s just boiling, stirring frequently.",
        "You should see the pectin dissolve.",

        "Place the jars in a tall stock pot on a rack.",
        "Fill the pot so the jars are beneath 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes.",
        "After the 10 minutes, carefully remove the jars from the water, using tongs or gloves if needed, and let them cool.",
        "You should hear the jars popping while they cool as the lids seal.",
        "The jelly will keep almost indefinitely, but it should be refrigerated if the jar doesn\u2019t seal or once it has been opened."
