If the strings were too far away from the neck or you over-adjusted, use your Allen wrench to turn the nut clockwise instead. Work a quarter turn at a time so you don\u2019t break the truss rod. Check the gap between the 7th fret and the top string with your feeler gauge after making an adjustment to ensure it\u2019s the right distance. If the strings are too far off of the neck, then they will be more difficult to press down and play individual notes. Usually, the strings play well if they\u2019re 0.006\u20130.012 inches (0.15\u20130.30 mm) above the frets.",

        "Clip the first capo to the left of the first metal fret from the end of the neck with the tuning pegs.",
        "Make sure it holds all of the strings down tightly against the neck.",
        "Find the 15th fret on the guitar neck and secure a capo to the left of it.",
        "The capos will keep the strings straight so you can see how much the neck bows in either direction.",
        "You can buy capos from music supply stores.",
        "Check the gap between the top string and 7th fret with a feeler gauge.",
        "Feeler gauges are thin pieces of metal that are used to measure the gap size between the strings and the neck.",
        "Choose a 0.007 in (0.18 mm) feeler gauge and slide it on top of the 7th fret so it goes underneath the thickest string, which is at the top of the neck.",
        "If the feeler gauge touches the string without forcefully lifting up from the neck, then you don\u2019t need to make any adjustments.",
        "If you needed to lift the string in order to slide the feeler gauge underneath it, then loosen the adjustment nut.",
        "If there\u2019s a gap thicker than the feeler gauge, then you need to tighten the truss rod.",
        "You can buy a set of feeler gauges from your local hardware store.",
        "Turn the nut counterclockwise if the neck bows up and touches the strings.",
        "Look at the strings near the 7th fret to see if they touch the neck.",
        "If they do, insert an Allen wrench into the hole for the adjustment nut and make sure the wrench is firmly seated.",
        "Rotate the nut counterclockwise by a quarter turn at a time to straighten out the neck.",
        "Check the gap with the feeler gauge to see if you\u2019ve adjusted it enough.",
        "If you don\u2019t raise the strings off of the neck, the strings will produce a buzzing sound when you play them.Warning: Don\u2019t force the adjustment nut to turn if it doesn\u2019t easily move, or else you could snap the truss rod.",
        "If you snap the truss rod, you will need to replace the neck.",
        "Rotate the nut clockwise to reduce the gap between the strings and neck.",
        "If the strings were too far away from the neck or you over-adjusted, use your Allen wrench to turn the nut clockwise instead.",
        "Work a quarter turn at a time so you don\u2019t break the truss rod.",
        "Check the gap between the 7th fret and the top string with your feeler gauge after making an adjustment to ensure it\u2019s the right distance.",
        "If the strings are too far off of the neck, then they will be more difficult to press down and play individual notes.",
        "Usually, the strings play well if they\u2019re 0.006\u20130.012 inches (0.15\u20130.30 mm) above the frets."
