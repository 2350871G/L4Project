                    "description": "Newly harvested sweet potatoes with the roots still attached are the best option to use. Plump sweet potatoes store just as well as skinny ones, and they have more usable \"meat\" to consume. If harvesting the sweet potatoes yourself, use a spade fork to dig 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) beneath the soil in order to get all the roots up. Handle them carefully since sweet potatoes tend to bruise easily, and shake off excess dirt but do not wash the roots."

The sweet potatoes need to cure for at least 7 days, but they can be kept there for as many as 14 days. The curing process creates a second skin that forms over scratches and bruises, allowing the sweet potatoes to last longer in storage. Use a small electric fan in the area to keep the air circulating. This helps to prevent rotting and molding. Monitor the temperature and humidity regularly to make sure that the sweet potatoes are sitting in the conditions needed for proper curing. For best results, keep the sweet potatoes from touching each other as they cure."

For best results, store the sweet potatoes in a basement or root cellar. If neither option is available to you, store them in a dark, cool, and well-ventilated cupboard or pantry away from strong heat sources. Do not use a refrigerator.
