The service you hire will either dig a trench or install a drain in the ground so water can easily escape in the future.Draining your crawl space can cost $1,000 USD and up. If your crawl space isn\u2019t properly drained and fixed by professionals, you risk moisture reappearing and reducing the lifespan of your insulation. Don\u2019t install insulation while there\u2019s still moisture in your crawl space since it could easily develop mold."

        "Make sure you buy enough insulation to cover all of your walls so you don\u2019t leave any areas exposed.You can buy rigid foam board insulation from your local home improvement store.",
        "You do not need to buy a separate vapor barrier since it\u2019s already built into the insulation.",
        "Slice straight through the back of the foam board to cut it to size.",
        "Set the foam board on a flat and sturdy work surface so the back side faces up.",
        "Extend the blade of a utility knife as far out as it can go and hold it at a 45-degree angle to the insulation.",
        "Pull the blade straight through the foam in a single motion.",
        "Continue cutting the insulation pieces as you need them so they fit your walls perfectly.Don\u2019t use a sawing motion while you\u2019re cutting the foam board since it will cause pieces to break or leave residue.",
        "Use a straightedge as a guide if you want to make your cuts perfectly straight.",
        "Attach the foam board to the wall with waterproof glue.",
        "Keep the foam board so the back side faces up, and shake a can of waterproof spray adhesive.",
        "Spray the adhesive around the edges of the foam board so it has even coverage before sticking it onto the wall.",
        "Firmly press around the edges so the glue adheres to the wall and makes a firm connection.",
        "Continue working around the walls of your crawl space to make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps in the insulation.You can buy waterproof spray glue from a hardware or home improvement store.",
        "If the insulation doesn\u2019t stick after you glue the edges, then carefully pull it back off of your wall and apply more glue to the middle of the foam board.Tip: If you have a layer of polyethylene sheets on your floor, cover the portion that extends up your walls by at least 6 inches (15 cm) so it creates a tight seal.",
        "Seal the seams between the insulation boards with waterproof tape.",
        "After placing all of the boards around your walls, cut strips of waterproof tape that match the length of the seams between the pieces.",
        "Start from the ceiling of your crawl space and work the tape down the length of the seam so it\u2019s easier to apply.",
        "Press the tape firmly so it has a firm connection and overlaps each piece by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm).You can buy waterproof tape from a hardware or home improvement store.",
        "Installing Ceiling Joist Insulation Find the area for the crawl space\u2019s ceiling.",
        "Start your tape measure in one of the ceiling corners in your crawl space.",
        "Extend the tape measure to the corner directly across from it to find the ceiling length.",
        "Keep the end of the tape measure in the same corner and pull it along the other wall to find the width.",
        "Multiply the height and width to find the ceiling area so you know how much insulation you need to buy.",
        "Measure the width between the ceiling joists as well so you know the width of the insulation you need to buy.",
        "Pick R-11 or R-25 fiberglass insulation batts for the easiest installation.",
        "The R-value refers to how effective the insulation is compared to the climate in your area.",
        "If you live in a warmer climate with high humidity, opt for insulation batts that have at least an R-11 rating.",
        "If you live in a cold climate or an area that has temperatures that drop below freezing, choose R-25 insulation since it\u2019s thicker and will keep your home warmer.",
        "Make sure the batts you buy are the same width as the floor joists, or else they won\u2019t fit as well.You can buy insulation batts from your local hardware or home improvement store.",
        "If there aren\u2019t batts that perfectly fit between your joists, then opt for a larger size so you can cut it down.",
        "Insulation that\u2019s too narrow will allow cold air through and make the insulation less effective.",
        "Wear safety glasses, a dust mask, and gloves to prevent irritation.",
        "Fiberglass insulation creates small particles that can cause irritation on your skin or in your lungs.",
        "Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes as well as a dust mask that covers your mouth and nose.",
        "Wear long-sleeved clothing, pants, and gloves to have the least amount of skin exposed.Tip: Apply baby powder to any exposed skin so the insulation particles aren\u2019t able to stick to your skin.",
        "That way, you\u2019ll get less irritation while you\u2019re working.",
        "Cut the insulation to size using a utility knife.",
        "Lay the insulation down so the vapor barrier on the back faces up.",
        "Lay a straightedge across the line you need to cut and press down firmly to compress the foam.",
        "Slice through the foam with a utility knife, using the straightedge as a guide for your cut.",
        "Continue cutting the insulation until it\u2019s the same length as the spaces between your joists.You may need to trim the width of the insulation if it doesn\u2019t fit perfectly between the joists.",
        "Push the insulation between the ceiling joists so the vapor barrier faces up.",
        "Guide the insulation into the spaces between the joists so the vapor barrier touches the floor.",
        "Be careful not to compress the insulation, or else it won\u2019t be as effective.",
        "Make sure that none of the ceiling is visible or exposed, or else air will still be able to escape and make the main floors in your home colder.",
        "Continue pressing the insulation in between each of the joists.Don\u2019t let the insulation bunch up while you\u2019re working with it since it won\u2019t create an effective seal.",
        "You may need to cut the insulation so it fits around any pipes or wiring.",
        "Place wire supports between the joists every 12\u201318 in (30\u201346 cm).",
        "Wire supports fit between the ceiling joists and prevent the insulation from falling out.",
        "Position the support horizontally between the joists and push it up against the insulation so it doesn\u2019t compress any more than 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "The ends of the support will stick into the wood so you don\u2019t need to secure it.",
        "Continue placing the supports along the length of the joists so the insulation doesn\u2019t move.You can also staple landscaping paper between the joists to prevent the insulation from falling, but it may be more difficult to access or replace the batts.",
        "You may need to cut the wire supports to size if they are too wide for the joists.",
        "Use a pair of wire cutters if needed."
