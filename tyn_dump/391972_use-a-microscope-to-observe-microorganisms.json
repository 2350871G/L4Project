Drawing what you see is another good option. Be sure to include any structures that you notice in your microorganisms. Some microscopes have the ability to hook up to a laptop and take pictures. This is a great way to capture what you see. Selecting and Preparing Microorganism Slides to Observe Use a pre-made slide. This is the best way for a beginner to know that they will be able to find a sample. Slides can be purchased that have permanently fixed samples of microorganisms. If you are using a microscope in a school lab, you will likely use this kind of slide. Select a safe, known microorganism to sample. If you do not want to use a pre-made slide, you can make your own. You should be very careful about the microorganisms you select. Do use any microorganisms collected from rotting food or the human body. This can be very dangerous. Put the microorganism sample onto a glass slide. Since you are dealing with organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye, chances are that you will be using a wet mount, which is a sample that is already suspended in a liquid (probably water). Use a pipet to place a drop of water on your glass slide. Try to center the water droplet on the slide. Glass slides are the standard, but plastic slides may be used as well. Cover with a coverslip. A coverslip is a small thin square of glass (or plastic) that covers your sample. It helps to flatten out the water droplet and hold your sample in place beneath the lens. If you do not have coverslips, another slide can be used to do this. Depression slides have a well that holds the sample. They are usually more expensive, but they do not require a cover slip. To avoid bubbles, put the coverslip on slowly at an angle. Setting Up Your Microscope to Observe Microorganisms Move the microscope to your workspace. Anytime you are carrying your microscope, you should have two hands on it. One hand goes under the base. The other hand holds the arm of the microscope. Select the lowest power lens. Make sure that the lowest power lens is in place before proceeding. This will allow you to get your microorganisms into focus before trying a high powered lens. The lowest power lens will be the shortest lens and will have the lowest number written on the side (for example 40x). Move the lens as far down as it will go. It is best to bring your microorganism into focus by adjusting the lens up. This way you do not go too far down and touch your slide. For this reason, you want your starting point to be as low as possible. Look at the microscope from the side while turning the coarse adjustment knob until the lens is as far down as it will go without touching the slide. Adjust the amount of light. Opening the diaphragm will allow more light to shine through the slide into the lens. Adjusting the mirror will make sure that the light is directed to the right point. open the diaphragm all the way, and adjust the mirror to get the most light possible.",
