The top of the soil should be about even with the bud onion (the bulbous, woody stalk at the base of the plant from which the stems will sprout), so that the roots are submerged by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm). Be sure to pack the soil firmly enough to anchor the rose, but not enough to smother or constrict it. Plant your rose at about the same level it was at in the pot or container. You will want a pot that is deep enough to fit your root ball and still leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the soil and the top. This helps prevent spilling when watering."

When raising an entire bush in a barrel, washtub, or grow bag, it\u2019s a good idea to put down multiple stakes 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) apart.

        "Planting Your Roses Dig a hole deep enough to seat the rose.",
        "Scoop out a narrow depression using the tip of your trowel.",
        "Remember that miniature roses should be planted at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep, while full-sized plants and bushes may need 18 inches (46 cm) to get comfortably situated.",
        "Heap the loose soil around the edges of the container rather than throwing it out.",
        "You\u2019ll need it to fill in the hole later.",
        "Place the rose inside the hole.",
        "Remove the young rose from its nursery pot and transfer it to the growing container.",
        "Use your fingers to gently separate the roots so that they\u2019re spread out evenly within the soil.",
        "Then, push the loose soil in around the plant and pat it down lightly to compress it.",
        "The top of the soil should be about even with the bud onion (the bulbous, woody stalk at the base of the plant from which the stems will sprout), so that the roots are submerged by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm).",
        "Be sure to pack the soil firmly enough to anchor the rose, but not enough to smother or constrict it.",
        "Plant your rose at about the same level it was at in the pot or container.",
        "You will want a pot that is deep enough to fit your root ball and still leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the soil and the top.",
        "This helps prevent spilling when watering.",
        "Provide a stake for large roses to climb.",
        "If you\u2019re cultivating a full-sized species, drive a gardening stake down into the soil just off to one side of the plant and bind it to the plant's lower canes using a looped rubber band or piece of twine.",
        "Once in place, it will act as a support structure for the rose to cling to as it grows.",
        "Sink the stake as deep as possible to make sure it's secure.",
        "Ideally, it should reach all the way down to the bottom of the container.",
        "When raising an entire bush in a barrel, washtub, or grow bag, it\u2019s a good idea to put down multiple stakes 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) apart.",
        "If you attempt to grow larger types of roses without the aid of a separate support structure, they\u2019ll eventually droop and spill out over the sides of the container.",
        "Caring for Container Roses Water your roses regularly to keep the soil moist.",
        "Use enough water to thoroughly dampen the soil from top to bottom without oversaturating it.",
        "Roses are thirsty plants, and may need as much as 1.5 gallons (around 5 liters) per day.",
        "It\u2019s important not to let your roses dry out.",
        "In between waterings, stick a finger into the soil.",
        "If it feels dry to the touch, it\u2019s probably time to water again.",
        "You may need to water your roses more frequently if you live in a particularly warm climate, or they spent most of the day in direct sunlight.",
        "Place your roses where they can get at least 6 hours of direct sunlight a day.",
        "Roses flourish in warm, brightly-lit conditions.",
        "For this reason, a west- or south-facing window is usually the best place to situate roses grown indoors.",
        "They\u2019ll do best when allowed to receive 7 or more hours a day, though miniature roses can get by on 4-5.",
        "If necessary, you can reposition your roses throughout the day to keep them bathed in the changing sunlight.",
        "Consider letting your roses spend most of the day outside on a sun-drenched porch, patio, or balcony during the warm summer months.",
        "Fertilize growing roses every 4-6 weeks.",
        "Go with a well-balanced liquid or slow-release fertilizer formulated for roses, such as 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 formula.",
        "These provide rose bushes with most of the nutrients they need to grow.",
        "To be on the safe side, always apply fertilizer soon after watering, and only use about half the amount recommended on the product packaging.",
        "Overfeeding your roses can burn the delicate roots, especially when they\u2019re dry.",
        "Once the flowers begin blooming, you can increase the frequency of your applications to once every 1-2 weeks.",
        "Roses grown outdoors will need to be fertilized more often than those grown indoors because of how much faster they develop.",
        "Space your individual containers 2 feet (0.61 m) apart.",
        "Leaving a little room between each container will increase the airflow around your roses, allowing them to take in more beneficial gases from the surrounding atmosphere.",
        "It can also help prevent the spread of fungal diseases by keeping affected foliage from coming into contact with healthy plants.",
        "In addition to preserving the health of your roses, spacing your containers strategically makes it possible to display them over a much wider area.",
        "Deadhead dead or dying blooms to make room for new growth.",
        "Inspect your roses periodically to look for dead or fading blooms.",
        "When you find them, clip the stem down to the first set of five leaflets using a pair of sharp pruning shears.",
        "Removing dead blooms will encourage healthy new flowers to return in their place.",
        "Get in the habit of pruning your roses back in the spring before they start blooming.",
        "Selective pruning can also be used to shape the plant to better fit a particular space.",
        "Always prune above an outward-facing bud to prevent inward growth.",
        "Repot your roses every 3 years.",
        "When roses outgrow a small container, they can become rootbound, which means there\u2019s no longer enough room for their roots to continue spreading.",
        "To prevent an established rose from becoming rootbound, simply loosen the soil around the edges of the old container, lift out the entire plant, and transfer it to its new home.",
        "Be sure to fill the new container with fresh potting soil and organic material.",
        "It\u2019s especially important to repot roses if you\u2019ve noticed their growth stalling, or they appear sickly despite having their needs met."
