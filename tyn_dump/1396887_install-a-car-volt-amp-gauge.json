If the gauge reading doesn\u2019t change, then disconnect the battery and check the wiring to make sure they\u2019re attached correctly.",

        " Feeding the Wires Mount the gauges in a gauge pod on top of your dashboard.",
        "The main panel for your dashboard normally doesn\u2019t have room to install additional meters, so it\u2019s easier to use a gauge pod, which is a standalone mount that rests on top of your dashboard.",
        "Position the gauges so they line up with the holes on the gauge pod and push them in to secure them in place.",
        "Keep the gauge pod somewhere on top of your dashboard where you can easily check the readouts.",
        "You can buy gauge pods online or from automotive stores.",

        "Push down on the rings of the grommet to feel if there\u2019s still space inside for wires to feed through.",
        "If there is, then you can use the hole.",
        "If not, look for another hole and grommet nearby.",

        "Attach in-line fuses to the ends of the wires in the engine bay with butt connectors.",
        "In-line fuses are built into wires to prevent shorts and protect wires from getting too hot.",
        "Strip the last \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation off the wires and 1 end off of each in-line fuse.",
        "Place the end of the red wire and 1 end of a 30-amp in-line fuse into opposite ends of a butt connector, which looks like a small tube, and crimp it in the middle.",
        "Repeat the process with the black wire and a second in-line fuse.",
        "Don\u2019t use wires without in-line fuses since they could create a fire hazard.",
        "Make sure the fuses can handle at least 30 amps, or else they won\u2019t work with your amp gauge.",
        "Lightly tug on the wires from outside of your vehicle to see which ones are connected to the gauge if you aren\u2019t sure.",
