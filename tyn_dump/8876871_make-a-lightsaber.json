Now, use your dominant hand to cut the noodle in half with a vertical cut. Keep the knife straight as you cut and move it up and down in slow, steady motions. You can use scissors if you'd like but it's much more difficult. Never use a knife or scissors without a parent present."

Each vertical piece of black tape should have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the lower black ring and the bottom of the lightsaber. Using Construction Paper Create an 18 inch (46 cm) tube using your colored construction paper. Start rolling your 12 by 18 inch (30 cm \u00d7 46 cm) piece of colored construction paper at a slight angle to make one end wider. If you need to adjust the roll's tightness, grab the corner that's inside the tube and pull on it. Once you make a tube, use a piece of clear packing tape to secure the edges. Wrap the entire tube in packing tape for more durability. Cut the top of the tube to straighten it.

Regardless of what you use, crunch your material into a ball and use a pencil or marker to shove it into the tube until it's packed full and sturdy. Insert the filling material piece by piece and don't overstuff the tube! Attach the black paper 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the tube's bottom. Take your 12 by 9 inch (30 cm \u00d7 23 cm) piece of black construction paper and wrap it around the bottom of your colored tube. Continue wrapping it in a tight tube and then attach it with a piece of tape. Be sure to wrap the paper evenly so that the top and bottom are perfectly horizontal. Swap black paper for gray if you'd like\u2014whatever you think looks the coolest! Close the ends of the lightsaber with packing tape to hold the filling. Cut a small circle of paper for each hole\u20141 the same color as your beam and 1 the same color as your handle. Afterward, place a square of tape over the paper circle, align the hole over the end, and then press the tape onto the paper tubing to hold it in place.
