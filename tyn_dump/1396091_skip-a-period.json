A traditional IUD does not release hormones, but one that contains hormones (like Mirena) does. The two standard methods are monophasic birth control pills and the NuvaRing. Monophasic pills: The active pills contain the same mix of hormones each week. Monophasic pills are steady and stable, with less spotting than multiphasic pills, making them better-suited to skipping periods. To skip a period: simply start a new packet of pills as soon as you finish the last active pill, and skip the seven-day placebo phase. Multiphasic pills: The mix of hormones in the active pills changes from week to week to account for the various phases of your cycle. This variability means that you must take the pills in the right order to effectively protect yourself. Ask your gynecologist about which pills are okay to skip. NuvaRing: This is a small, bendable ring that you insert into your vagina for three weeks at a time. Usually, you remove the ring for one week each month \u2013 but you can leave the ring in for this extra fourth week in order to skip your period. If you put in a new ring immediately at the end of the four weeks, then you can continue to offset your period."
