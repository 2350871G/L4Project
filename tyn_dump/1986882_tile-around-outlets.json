At the home\u2019s electrical box, find the switch powering the outlet(s) with which you\u2019ll be working and turn it off. Use caution since some kitchens may have two separate switches powering the space. Test the current to a live outlet. Use a current tester to check an outlet that you know still has power running to it. This allows you to check your tester to ensure that it\u2019s in proper working order before trying it on the inactive outlet. Test the inactive outlet(s). Now that you know your tester is working, try it against the inactive outlet(s) to ensure that they have indeed been powered down. Extending the Outlet Remove the cover from the electrical outlet. The cover can be removed by loosening the screws securing it to the outlet. There will either be one screw in the center, or two screws on the top and bottom of the outlet cover. Place the outlet cover and the screws aside. Unscrew the outlet from the electrical box. There will be two long mounting screws securing the electrical outlet to the blue electrical box. Remove them so you can insert the outlet extenders. Insert outlet extenders to a sufficient depth for your tile. Since the tile adds additional depth from the wall, the original outlet location will be sunken back from the tile surface. You can use either accordion-style or box-style outlet spacers to raise the outlet flush with the tile. The accordion design spacers fold over with 1/8\u201d added for each segment.

An outlet box extender is a rectangular ring that fits over and behind the outlet to add additional space between the original outlet box and the outlet. Reattach the outlet loosely with the spacers in place. Regardless of which type of extender you use, the design has a hole, so you can feed the mounting screw through the extender and back into the outlet box. You won\u2019t tighten it down until after you place your tile. This will also allow you to test if your current screws are long enough to reattach the outlet with the extender in place. You may have to purchase longer screws. Cutting the Tiles to Size Measure the cut you need to make.

Installing the Tile around the Outlet Install the tiles around the outlet. Apply tile mastic or quick-set mortar to the area around the outlet, being careful not to get any into the electrical box. Push the cut tiles firmly into place. Use appropriately sized tile spacers to keep consistent space between the tiles as they set. Apply grout between the joints. You have to finish grouting the space between the tiles before you can tighten down the electrical outlet in the box. Tighten down the electrical outlet. You may have to hold the outlet in place as you tighten to stop it from twisting and misaligning with the faceplate. Replace the electrical outlet cover. Once the tiles are installed and grouted, replace the outlet cover. The outlet cover should hide all the cut edges of your tiles.",
