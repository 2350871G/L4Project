For 32 ounces (946 ml) of coffee, which is approximately 3 to 4 servings, use a measuring cup to measure a \u00bd cup (51 g) of beans. The standard size for most coffee presses is 32 ounces (946 ml), but you can make fewer servings if you prefer. For a single serving, measure 2 tablespoons (13 g) of beans. For 2 servings, measure a \u00bc cup (26 g) of beans."

For the best flavor, coffee beans should always be ground just before brewing (ideally within 15 minutes). Grinding before this will lead to stale, oxidized coffee. In most cases, the finer you grind the beans, the weaker the coffee will be. The coarser the grind, the stronger the coffee will be.

Boil the water in an electric or stovetop kettle, but then remove the water from the heat and allow it to cool for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute before making the coffee. If you\u2019re making a single serving of coffee, heat 1 cup (237 ml) of water. For two servings, heat 2 cups (474 ml) of water. You can use tap water to make your coffee. However, be sure to drink some first to ensure that it doesn\u2019t have a bad taste. If it does taste odd, use filtered or bottled water instead."

Unless you're traveling with your press and have to worry about possible breakage, it's best to use a glass press. Plastic pots can sometimes affect the taste of your coffee.
