Iron the interfacing to your outside fabric to stiffen it.  Sew the short sides of your rectangles together. First the outer layer, then the inner layer, then your insulation. Assemble and pin all three layers together with their top flap edges together. Inner and outer layer should be facing, insulation can be on the back of either layer. Sew along the opening edge.  Clip insulation back to the seam line.  Clip all corners to ease turning.  Pin and sew the OUTER fabric bottom rectangle to itself to form the bottom.  Turn the bag right side out.  Pin the top edge and then top stitch it to hold it in place. You can add \"quilting\" stitches to the bag at this point to help hold the layers together if you wish.
