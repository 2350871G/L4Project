There should be enough water so you can completely submerge your sheet, but if you fill the bathtub with too much water, it will be hard to get the color dye you need. Most household water heaters are set between 120\u2013140 \u00b0F (49\u201360 \u00b0C), so the hottest water from your tap should be enough. You'll get better results with hotter water, so if your water heater is set to 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C), you may want to boil a pot of water on your stove and add it to the bath to bring the temperature up. You can also pour the water into a very large bucket or container. Variation: If you prefer, you can dye your sheet in the washing machine. Just fill the basin with hot water, add the dye and the sheet, and turn off the washing machine cycle. Allow the sheet to soak for 30 minutes, then run your machine as usual to rinse the sheet.

Doing this will ensure that the dye mixes more evenly when you add it to the bath. A single box of dye should be enough for 1 sheet.
