You can add about 1 in (2.5 cm) of water in the fall to keep the soil moist. However, stop adding water after frost occurs in your area. You can test the soil by picking some up and rubbing it between your fingers. Moist soil clumps into a ball instead of falling apart. Maintaining Your Bulbs Water the bulbs about once a week. Before giving the bulbs more water, check the soil. If it is moist, hold off on watering. Bulbs are prone to rotting in moist conditions, so avoid adding water unless it is necessary. If you get rain in your area during the week, you probably will not need to water the bulbs. Bulbs in pots need more care, so check them frequently to ensure the soil stays moist. Fertilize the bulbs once a year. Bulbs are low-maintenance, so you don\u2019t need to add fertilizer often. Try to apply the fertilizer at the same time every year. Purchase a balanced fertilizer or bone meal and spread it in a thin layer over the bulb garden. You can add the fertilizer when planting the bulbs, when they start growing in spring, or after they bloom in summer. Read the instructions on the fertilizer to ensure you use the appropriate amount. Avoid cutting the plant when it browns. After the bulbs bloom, the visible parts of the plant wither and die. While this isn\u2019t the prettiest sight, it\u2019s good for the plant. The plant reverts nutrients back to the bulb. Cutting off the leaves and other parts can make your bulb weaker next year. Once most of the plant has browned and collapsed, you can cut the parts off with a knife or garden pruners. Spread mulch over the bulb garden in the fall. Before the ground freezes, cover your gardening area with a mulch such as pine bark. Make a layer about 4 in (10 cm) deep. The mulch helps insulate your bulbs as well as protect them from weeds and pesky animals that may want to dig up your garden. Mulch does not have to be added in the warmer months. Since it retains moisture, mulching in warm weather may lead to rotten bulbs. Put up nets to block pests that damage bulbs. Digging animals, like squirrels, are the main threat to your bulbs. In the fall, install wire netting or make a cage out of cloth and chicken wire. Use it to cover your bulb garden so that animals stay away. Spraying the ground with a natural repellant, such as castor oil, can scare away moles, deer, snails, and other nuisances. During the growing months, monitor your plants for bite marks from deer and snails.",
