                    "description": "Every horror movie ever made follows a simple but highly customizable format. Unless you have a really good reason to break it, the following format will help you quickly draft up your movie for the best pacing. Use this structure to build the skeleton of your movie, then make it unique in the individual scenes:\n\nBeginning: Open on a scary event. This is usually the villain's first victim-- the murder or event that sets the movie in motion and shows the villain's \"style\". In Scream, for example, it is Drew Barrymore's babysitter character and boyfriend getting murdered. The Set-Up: Who are your main characters, and why are they in this \"horrible\" place? The teens might head to the Cabin in the Woods, or the family moves into the creepy old house in Amityville. Either way, we get to know the future \"victims\" of your script. The villain or evil may be present, but is lurking in the background. This is the first 10-15% of your movie. The Warning: Roughly a third of the way into the script, a few characters realize that not everything is as it seems. Many of them will ignore or miss the signs, but the viewer knows that the evil is growing around them. The Point of No Return: The characters realize they are stuck in this horror. The first character dies, the villain appears, or they get literally trapped, like in The Descent. There is no more ignoring the danger. This is usually halfway through the story. The Major Set-Back: At 75% or so, the characters believe they have won. Suddenly, however, the villain comes back even stronger than before. This false sense of security lulls the characters into near-certain doom. The Climax: Your main character(s) makes a final push to survive by escaping or defeating the villain. The adrenaline is high, and you need a climactic fight/scare/moment to cap everything off. The Resolution: All is well, and the main character has survived. The villain appears dead, and everything is good again... at least until the sequel or very ending, when evil often resurfaces (Drag Me to Hell, V/H/S)."

                    "description": "This is the classic way to open up a horror film, as it preps the audience for what is to come and unsettles them early on. The best horror movies scare viewers even when nothing bad is happening because the opening scene makes them aware of the evil lurking around the corner. Use this first scene to prime the audience for future scares. It shouldn't be the most terrifying moment in the movie -- just enough to make them curious or worried. The Exorcist's opening isn't the scariest thing in the world, but the odd, primordial location hints at the ancient, malevolent demon that lurks underneath the surface throughout the movie. Scream boasts one of the most famous, and chilling, openings in horror history. It is basically a short film showcasing the killer's first villain. Writer Kevin Williamson gives us everything -- tone, gore, humor, and terror -- while showing us that no one is safe. There are exceptions to this rule. Cabin in the Woods starts mundanely in an effort to lure the viewer into a false sense of security, for example."

If they don't then the eventual deaths will ring hollow and you won't get great scares as a result. All of the best horror movies have the best characters, not just a good villain. Take some time to let your characters converse and hang out before the evil really takes hold -- it will pay off later. The Poltergeist takes its time making you feel for the \"average American family\" at the core of it, making their later terrors feel like they could happen in anyone's home, anywhere. Nightmare on Elm Street spends a good 15-20 minutes at the kid's school, then another few minutes at a standard slumber party, building up sympathy for the main characters. You're Next goes the opposite direction, setting up the dysfunctional, annoying, manipulative family at the heart of the movie so that you root for the killers (who are being hunted) by the ending."

This is your biggest challenge while writing -- building tension carefully without boring the audience or numbing them to the scares. The easiest way to do this is to defy expectations. Remember -- viewers are often more scared by what they don't see than what they do. Use the fear of the unknown to your advantage. Once you've set up characters and setting, start to break the norm -- moving furniture, missing characters, odd signs/signals, ominous news bulletins, etc. Again, watching the experts will help you:\n\nThe Conjuring doesn't kill a single person, yet is considered by many a modern classic. The tension comes from what is not on screen. When you see the shaking cabinets, shadowy feet, and hear strange noises, the viewer's imagination does all the work for them. Halloween succeeds largely because we don't know where Michael Myers is at any time. He could be behind any corner, in any room, because the writer wisely leaves him in the background in order to build tension. Because he so rarely \"jumps out,\" we never know when to expect him. Many horror films rely on \"jump scares,\" when a loud noise or quick jump startles the viewer immediately. However, modern movies are using \"fake\" scares to build tension, having good guys (or pets) pop out to lull the viewer into a sense of security."

This scene needs to be scary, a big payoff from the prior minutes of tension building, so work on making this scene stand out.

The Night of the Living Dead has a tense, action-filled attempt at escape, a chance to get everyone out of the farmhouse.

Humor is also a great way to give a false sense of calm, making the next scare hit even harder. Pure tension gets old, and eventually doesn't feel tense anymore. Try placing a joke or two shortly after a big scare scene early in the movie.

Depending on your movie, you can take this in multiple directions, but, in general, the characters either decide to run away or fight back the evil. Funny Games' main character decides, despite her hatred for the villains, that all she can do is run. What follows is a tense, cat & mouse scene of hopeful escape. Dawn of the Dead finds the desperate survivors willing to fight for their freedom, taking the battle straight to the zombies instead of waiting. Provide the audience some semblance of resolution. By the end of the move, you need to reveal the killer (if it is another character), and you need to show whether or not the main character has triumphed. Commonly, the main character triumphs over the evil, only to be taken by surprise at the very end of the movie, like in Drag Me to Hell and Nightmare on Elm Street. Sometimes the main characters are killed, but there is a hint that the villain is not actually dead. No matter what your ending is, you need to provide the audience some closure, even if you imply that things are still dangerous. Improving Your Script Let the atmosphere, tension, and fear come through on the page. You cannot just say, \"It will be scary when it is on a screen.\" A terrifying scene must be terrifying on the page as well, building suspense that helps the directors, producers, and actors see where the scene is coming. Make the screenplay scary, tense, and atmospheric and the movie will be full of frights. Read horror writers like Edgar Allen Poe and Stephen King to learn about creating tension through words alone. You may have to bend some screenplay conventions to build a tense, terrifying scene on the page. Remember, however, that your first goal is to write a script that accurately portrays the movie that is eventually made. Keep things as real as possible. Horror already pushes the limits of \"suspension of disbelief,\" so don't give your viewers any additional reasons to push the script away. Characters should act realistically, meaning they are afraid for their lives and don't make obviously dumb mistakes like following the killer or ignoring warning signs. The killer should be overpowering, but not so much so that you can't root for the protagonists to ultimately win (even if they don't). Finding realism in horror is mostly about writing realistic characters, but a generally consistent, realistic world, even if it is clearly fictional, will help your scares hit harder. Spend time on 1-2 big, original, showstopping scenes, usually deaths. Horror movies live and die based on their signature scenes. Scream is a great movie, but even if it wasn't the opening death would be enough to keep it famous. A great, memorable death will be the signature scene of your movie, and what helps readers remember it for years to come. The entire Final Destination series is built on 4-5 of these moments each movie. While the don't always work, each one has at least one death that viewers will never forget. Psycho is a great movie, but without the shower scene it likely would have fallen out of collective memory years ago. The scene was so jarring, so surprising, that it is still discussed and satirized today. Toss some humor into the script. No one wants to sit in pure tension for two hours, and this ultimately makes the movie's later scares less effective. There is a good reason horror and comedy are so commonly mixed, and that is because they are two sides of the same coin -- surprise. Let a few jokes ease the tension, helping your audience relax here and there while still sitting on the edge of their seat. Humor is also a great way to give a false sense of calm, making the next scare hit even harder. Pure tension gets old, and eventually doesn't feel tense anymore. Try placing a joke or two shortly after a big scare scene early in the movie. This helps the audience \"get over\" the rush of the first scare, letting you start building tension again for the next one. Listen to horrifying music while you work. This doesn't mean you should put Vanilla Ice on. Find horror soundtracks and play them in the background while you write, creating the atmosphere of tension as you work. You can always work in silence as well, but for those looking for a little creative kick you can't go wrong with the Halloween or The Conjuring soundtrack.",
