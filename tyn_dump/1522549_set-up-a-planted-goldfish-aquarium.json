        "Make sure your tank isn't too close to a window or directly in front of a door.",
        "Choose a location with as stable a temperature as possible.",
        "Create a substrate of gravel 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) deep.",
        "Start by purchasing some small pea gravel\u2014about 0.078 to 0.118 inches (2.0 to 3.0 mm)\u2014quartz gravel, or a combination of both.",
        "These are simple substrates in terms of cleaning, which is ideal as goldfish create lots of waste.",
        "Use sand if you like, but be wary that it can become very compacted, which can inhibit plant root growth and lead to anaerobic patches.",
        "Avoid using soil or alternative planting substrate as they are much more difficult to clean with a vacuum.",
        "In addition, goldfish are likely to dig up the planting substrate and make a mess.",
        "Use dark-colored gravel to make your goldfish stand out.",
        "Install LED or full-spectrum fluorescent lights in your aquarium.",
        "Purchase overhead LED lights from your local pet store.",
        "Make sure that the bulbs aren't covered by a plastic barrier and change them every 12 months.",
        "In addition, always make sure your goldfish get 8 to 12 hours of light and turn the lights off at night to maintain a proper day/night cycle.",
        "Use lights that are less than 2.5 fluorescent watts per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.",
        "Purchase a water diffuser to keep your aquarium's oxygen circulating.",
        "Although not absolutely necessary, a water diffuser ensures oxygen circulation, which is important for the longevity of your fish and plants.",
        "Just make sure to pick a product designed for your aquarium's depth.Typically, you'll need to connect the airlines to your diffuser, put the diffuser at the bottom of your aquarium, and connect the air compressor to the airlines.",
        "Check the manufacturer's instructions for your diffuser for specific instructions.",
        "Install a power or under-gravel filter.",
        "For first-time tank owners, purchase a power filter and hang it from the back of the tank\u2014this is the easiest installation process.",
        "If you purchase an under-gravel filter, make sure the air pump or powerhead is designed for your tank's size and follow the manufacturer's instruction for placement instructions.",
        "Always use a power filter designed to filter your water at least 5 times per hour.",
        "For example, a 20 US gal (76 L) tank needs a filter that circulates at least 100 gallons per hour.",
        "Be sure to vacuum the gravel regularly if you have an under-gravel filter.",
        "To do this, move an aquarium vacuum tip in a straight line through the gravel.",
        "Take care not to move it up and down or back and forth.",
        "Choosing Plants Purchase giant vallis plants if you have a large, deep tank.",
        "Giant vallis are long, thin plants with leaves that extend in clusters from their roots.",
        "Also known as Vallisneria gigantica, these plants can grow more than 3 feet (0.91 m) long, although you can try smaller V. americana, V. spiralis, and V. tortifolia varieties if you don't mind sacrificing durability.",
        "Trim these plants at an angle for the best results.",
        "Try Amazon sword plants if you want plants that can withstand goldfish bites.",
        "With their tough, large leaves and strong roots, this plant genus works well in a goldfish tank.",
        "The Echinodorus amazonicus is best, but E. bleheri and E. ocelot also work.",
        "If you prefer a smaller size, try E. tenellus, which is still very durable.",
        "Some Amazon swords grow best in warmer water\u2014if they aren't growing properly in your tank, try a different plant genus.",
        "Plant Java fern for an easily cleanable option.",
        "Although they vary lots between geographic varieties, they are known for green, creeping horizontal stems.",
        "These plants are not tasty to goldfish, but they'll still pull on the leaves.",
        "Luckily, they are very durable and also propagate well.",
        "They're also quite easy to remove from the tank and clean around.",
        "Buy java ferns that are attached to terracotta sticks or bogwood for the best growth.",
        "You can also tie the plant to them using fishing line and they will take root and cover the fishing line after they grow.",
        "Buy pond weed for cheap plants your goldfish can eat.",
        "Pond weed is known for its bushy appearance due to its profusely branching leaves.",
        "Although your goldfish will most likely eat these plants\u2014Elodea/Egeria densa and E. crispa are most common\u2014they are cheap, grow quickly, and a great distraction from other plants.",
        "As an added bonus, pond weed can remove nitrates from your tank.",
        "Keep pond weed in bunches to make it easy to clean up after your fish eat the plants.",
        "Purchase hornwort if you want a floating plant.",
        "Also known as Ceratophyllum demersum, you have the choice of bunching them up or leaving them to float.",
        "Like pondweed, they are cheap and grow fast, making them a great budget-friendly choice.",
        "Hornwort is a great alternative to pond weed that distracts fish from other plants.",
        "Use hornwort to curb excessive nitrate levels.",
        "Nestle the plants into the substrate.",
        "Once you've chosen a few plants, decide where you'd like to position them.",
        "Gently insert their roots under the gravel substrate to anchor them down.",
        "Alternatively, plant the plants in small glass jars filled with soil and top the soil with a layer of gravel or sand.",
        "Place floating varieties on top of the substrate and let them float once you add in the water.",
        "Adjusting the Water Quality Fill your aquarium with conditioned water.",
        "Start by filling up buckets of water and add a water conditioner and remove chlorine from the water.",
        "Then, gently pour the required amount of water into your tank.",
        "If you don't want to purchase a water conditioner, fill the tank and let it sit for 1 day before adding your goldfish.",
        "This will give the chlorine time to evaporate.",
        "Keep the water pH between 7.2 and 7.6.",
        "Use pH paper to test water the pH every day.",
        "To increase the pH, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baking soda per 5 gallons (19 L) of water.",
        "To decrease the pH, add a small amount of peat moss.",
        "Buy peat moss and pH paper pet stores and online suppliers.",
        "EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoug Ludemann\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProfessional Aquarist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoug Ludemann is the owner and operator of Fish Geeks, LLC, an aquarium services company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
        "Doug has worked in the aquarium and fish-care industry for over 20 years, including having worked as a professional aquarist for the Minnesota Zoo and Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.",
        "He received his Bachelor of Science in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior from the University of Minnesota.",
        "Doug Ludemann\t\t\tProfessional Aquarist\t\t\t\tCheck the pH and CO2 levels first thing in the morning.",
        "Plants consume CO2 and release O2 through the process of photosynthesis, which can help balance the levels in your tank.",
        "However, they only do this during the day when the sun is up.",
        "When the lights go off, your fish are still using oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, so over the course of the night, the CO2 and pH levels will fluctuate.",
        "Over time, this can create stresses on your animals, so it's important to monitor it closely.",
        "Run a fishless cycle for 4 to 6 weeks to create necessary bacteria.",
        "Either use fish food or household ammonia to keep ammonia levels at 2 ppm daily.",
        "After the ammonia level starts decreasing due to bacteria growth, continue bringing the ammonia levels back up with fish food or household ammonia and start testing for nitrite.",
        "Once nitrite levels spike, decrease the ammonia to \u00bc of the dose, start testing for nitrate, and continue the cycle until there is 0 ppm of ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite.",
        "Test ammonia levels every 2 to 3 days\u2014ideally at the same time daily.",
        "Nitrite levels usually spike after 14 to 20 days.",
        "Determine the amount of fish food or household ammonia needed to bring the ammonia levels to 2 ppm and use the same dose throughout the cycle.",
        "Keep the water at 74 \u00b0F (23 \u00b0C) with a water heater.",
        "In general, heaters attach to the tank with suction cups.",
        "Always position the heater close to or at the mouth of your filter to keep the expelled water heated evenly.",
        "Just remember that most heater thermostats are set to 70 to 77 \u00b0F (21 to 25 \u00b0C) automatically.",
        "Install your water heater after filling your tank with water.",
        "Buy a heater that's fully submersible with an adjustable thermostat.",
        "Adding Fish and Maintaining Your Aquarium Add aquarium ornaments like wood and rocks.",
        "Now you can start adding ornaments to make your aquarium look nice!",
        "Head to a local aquarium store and purchase branches, driftwood, and small hollow logs.",
        "For rocks, you can collect them from the local forest so long as you boil them first to get rid of bacteria.",
        "If you use driftwood, be aware that it will turn the water a brown color as it dissolves unless you use genuine hardwood.",
        "Some rocks and seashells will make the water alkaline as they dissolve, so be sure to continue testing the pH.",
        "Don't place anything sharp in your tank, as goldfish have poor eyesight and may be injured by sharp objects.",
        "Put your goldfish in the tank.",
        "Buy goldfish from a reputable local store or online shop.",
        "Float the goldfish bag in the tank for 10 minutes so that the fish won't be shocked by the change in water temperature.",
        "Now, pour the fish out of the bag into a net over an empty bucket so that the pet store water does not get into your aquarium.",
        "Immediately place the fish in the tank.",
        "Don't add more than 2 goldfish per week in order to give your bacteria cycle some time to multiply and account for the increase in ammonia production.",
        "Avoid selecting fish with no spots, bloating, ragged fins, strange growth, or fuzzy growths.",
        "If the goldfish are especially stressed\u2014such as if they're sitting to the bottom of the tank and clamping their fins\u2014turn off the lights and don't feed the fish until the next day.",
        "Swap 30% of the water with fresh water each week.",
        "You can remove the water with a bucket or use a siphon.",
        "Just make sure that your replacement water is dechlorinated and purified.",
        "After adding new water, check the pH, temperature, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels and adjust them if needed.",
        "Clean your aquarium once per week.",
        "Always start by removing your fish with a fishnet and putting them in a bucket of conditioned water.",
        "Afterwards, use an algae pad to wipe down the glass with an aquarium-safe glass cleaner and water or a 1:1 solution of vinegar and water.",
        "Finally, clean the gravel with a siphon-type vacuum.",
        "Clean all tank decorations with your algae pad.",
        "Scrape off tough algae with a plastic or razor blade.",
        "Don't use any bleach, soap, or cleaning chemicals as these can contaminate the water.",
        "Make your own gentle aquarium siphon and vaccum if you don't have one already."
