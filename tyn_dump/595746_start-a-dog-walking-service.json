        "Design a business card online with a company like Vistaprint, that makes customizing and ordering business cards easy and inexpensive.",
        "Resist handing your card out to anyone and everyone.",
        "Instead, stick to veterinary clinics, pet supply stores, as well as family and friends who are likely to pass the word along.",
        "Your business card should be attractive and include at least your business name, website, and contact information (phone number and email address).",
        "Go above and beyond for your customers.",
        "One of the best ways to market your business is by going above and beyond for the customers that you do have.",
        "Satisfied customers will likely recommend you to their dog owning friends, which will increase your number of clients.",
        "Consider giving a referral discount to clients who bring in new clients.",
        "By sharing that you\u2019ll give anyone who gets you a new client 2 free 30 minute walks, for example, you\u2019ll give them an extra incentive to spread the word."
