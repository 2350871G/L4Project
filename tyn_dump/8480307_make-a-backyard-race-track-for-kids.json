Will it have two like an ordinary street or will it have four lanes like some toy racing sets? To get the right dimensions, measure the width of one of your child's toy cars. Each lane on the track should be wide enough to accommodate one car. Then multiply the width of the car by the number of tracks you want. This should give you a rough estimate of how wide the track should be. For example, if your child's toy cars are one inch (2.54 cm) wide, your track will need to be more than four inches (10.16 cm) wide. This will ensure a little space between each car so that they are not packed tightly together."
