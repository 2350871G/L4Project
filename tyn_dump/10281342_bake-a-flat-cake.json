                    "description": "One of the simplest ways to prevent a cake from doming is to ensure that the pan is filled evenly and is not overfilled with batter. Follow the recipe's instructions on pan size with care; the author of the recipe should have clarified the appropriate pan size for the amount of batter created. If this is not clear, there are cake capacity charts available but a general rule is to fill pans of a depth of 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5cm) halfway with batter and pans that are 3 to 4 inches (7.5-10cm) deep two-thirds the way with batter. With more experience, you'll get used to eyeballing the correct level and you'll instinctively know when it has been overfilled. This is especially important if you're baking 3 or more cakes, such as for layered cake batters. Measure each portion of the cake batter when you fill each separate pan. Use identical cake pans for each cake to be baked and set these on a scale when you pour in the batter. Measure the exact same amount of batter into each pan to ensure even baking. If you accidentally put more batter into 1 pan than another, it will puff up and crown more than the other, so scoop out any excess."

Bake the cake at 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) instead of 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Most cake recipes instruct you to bake the cake at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).

Avoid pushing too hard or the cake will sink in the center. Use caution when pressing down because the cake pan will still be hot. Cutting a Level Top Cool the cake for at least 1 hour before you cut the top. Once you remove the cake from the oven, place it on a wire rack to cool.
