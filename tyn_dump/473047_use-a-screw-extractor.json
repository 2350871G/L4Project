    "text": " Getting the Screw Ready Put on safety gear. Using a screw extractor involves drilling into metal. The last thing you want is a flying shard of metal in your eye. Wear safety goggles made with polycarbonate lenses. Align a center punch over the screw. A center punch is a metal cylinder that looks like a pen. You can find them at any hardware store. With one hand, hold the metal tip against the center of the screw head. Indent the screw by hammering in the punch. Pick up a hammer in your free hand and use it to tap the top of the punch.

Drilling the Screw Select a drill bit slightly smaller than the screw. Hold the drill bits up to the screw or fastener you need to remove.
