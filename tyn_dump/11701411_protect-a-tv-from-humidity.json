Look for a case made out of ABS plastic or an aluminum mixture. Shop for an outdoor waterproof TV cover online or visit your local electronics store.

Some covers are meant to be used just when the TV isn\u2019t on, which means you would have to remove it and put it back on yourself often.

If condensation is forming, there\u2019s a good chance that the humidity level is high. Pay attention to how you feel. If your skin feels sticky and the air around you feels thick, you\u2019re most likely dealing with high humidity.
