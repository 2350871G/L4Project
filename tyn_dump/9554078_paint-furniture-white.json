Use a soft paint brush to add the varnish, and work in unidirectional, long movements. Use fine sandpaper (100 to 180 grit) on the first layer of varnish before painting on the second. Put your furniture back together. Let the paint and varnish dry for around 72 hours before you start putting the furniture back together. Slide the shelves or drawers back into place. Use a screwdriver to re-attach any hinges and knobs. Now you can use and enjoy your newly painted furniture! Finished! ",
