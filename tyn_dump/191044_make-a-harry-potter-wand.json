    "text": " Using a Wooden Dowel or Stick Get a wooden dowel that is between 10 and 13 inches (25.4 and 33.02 centimeters). You can find them at craft stores; they are usually sold in packs. You can also get a longer dowel and cut it down using a hacksaw. You can also use a stick that you found outside. Make sure that it is no thicker than your finger, close to the length you want it, and fairly straight. Sand down one end of the dowel so that it is rounded. This will make the tip. You can even sand the wand so that it tapers slightly, just like the wands in the movies. Start with a coarse-grit sandpaper and finish off with a finer grit. If you are using a stick, you'll want to sand down any sharp, pointy, or jagged ends. You can leave the bark and knobs on the stick, or you can cut/sand them off.

Making a Wand out of Paper Start to roll a sheet of paper into a thin, tight stick. Start at the bottom left corner of the paper and roll it towards the upper right corner. Stop when you reach past the widest point of the paper. Apply some liquid glue on the last third of the paper. To avoid making the paper too soggy, apply the glue in a thin layer with a brush. At this point, you can also add a core to your wand. Here are some options:\nPhoenix feather: red, orange, or yellow feather. Dragon heartstring: piece of red yarn. Unicorn hair: silver or iridescent thread or tinsel. Finish rolling the paper and hold it until the glue dries. This can take 20 to 30 minutes. If you do not wish to hold your wand for that long, you can secure it with some string or twist ties. The glue must be dry before you move on. Trim the ends off.

        "Using a Chopstick Get a chopstick.",
        "If you are making this for a child, a regular chopstick will work just fine.",
        "If you are making this for a teen or an adult, consider getting one of those 15-inch (38.1 centimeters) bamboo cooking chopsticks.",
        "Don't worry about the color; you will be painting it later on!",
        "Can't find a chopstick?",
        "You can try using a long, wooden paintbrush instead.",
        "Just snap the brush part off, just below the metal crimp.",
        "You can also saw it off using a hacksaw.",
        "Use hot glue to build up the handle and wand.",
        "The handle should be about the length of your finger.",
        "Cover the handle area with hot glue let it harden.",
        "Add 2 to 3 more layers, if needed.",
        "To create a wand like Harry's, draw vertical lines to make the handle.",
        "Make them thicker at the base of the wand and thinner towards the other end of the handle.",
        "Some wands are plain but others, such as Hermione Granger's, have designs on the rest of the wand.",
        "You can use the hot glue to draw vines, squiggles, or spirals.",
        "You can create a neat design just by twirling your wand in your fingers while drawing a line.",
        "Add a bead or button to the bottom of the wand.",
        "Some wands have a fancier handle base.",
        "If you'd like yours to have one too, you can hot glue a small bead or fancy button to the base of your wand.",
        "The bead or button should be the same width as your wand; it should not extend past the edges by much.",
        "Think about the bead or button's design and don't worry about the color.",
        "You will be painting this.",
        "You can always leave the bead or button unpainted, especially if it is a pretty crystal one!",
        "Paint the wand a base color using acrylic paint.",
        "Most wants will be some shade of brown, but the Harry Potter movies also had wands that were white or black.",
        "You can even paint your want different shades of one color to make it look more like wood.",
        "Consider using watered-down acrylic paints if your chopsticks are made out of bamboo.",
        "This way, the original texture still shows through.",
        "Add some weathering using lighter and darker shades of your base color.",
        "Take the darker shade, and use it to fill in any nooks and crannies on your wand.",
        "You can use a q-tip or a pointy brush to get to those hard-to-reach areas.",
        "Then, take your lighter shade, and use it to highlight all of the raised areas.",
        "If your wand is black, you will only need the highlights.",
        "If your wand is white, you will only need the shadows.",
        "Seal the wand with a clear, acrylic sealer to make the paint last longer.",
        "Bring the wand outside and set it down on a sheet of paper.",
        "Spray it with some clear, acrylic sealer, and wait for it to dry.",
        "When the wand dries, turn it over, and spray the other side.",
        "Repeat this step, if necessary.",
        "Sealing the wand is not absolutely necessary, but it can make the paint job last longer.",
        "You can use a matte, satin, or glossy finish.",
        "Making a Wand out of Paper Start to roll a sheet of paper into a thin, tight stick.",
        "Start at the bottom left corner of the paper and roll it towards the upper right corner.",
        "Stop when you reach past the widest point of the paper.",
        "Apply some liquid glue on the last third of the paper.",
        "To avoid making the paper too soggy, apply the glue in a thin layer with a brush.",
        "At this point, you can also add a core to your wand.",
        "Here are some options:\nPhoenix feather: red, orange, or yellow feather.",
        "Dragon heartstring: piece of red yarn.",
        "Unicorn hair: silver or iridescent thread or tinsel.",
        "Finish rolling the paper and hold it until the glue dries.",
        "This can take 20 to 30 minutes.",
        "If you do not wish to hold your wand for that long, you can secure it with some string or twist ties.",
        "The glue must be dry before you move on.",
        "Trim the ends off.",
        "The tightly-rolled paper is probably very pointy at both ends.",
        "Use a pair of scissors or a craft knife to trim off both of the pointy ends.",
        "You will want to trim off one end more than the other.",
        "This will make the end wider, suitable for the base of your wand.",
        "Apply some hot glue to both ends of the wand.",
        "This will seal the tube further, and prevent it from unraveling.",
        "For an extra touch, hot glue a small fancy bead or button to the bottom of your wand.",
        "Make sure that the bead or button is the same width as your wand; it shouldn't go past the edges.",
        "Use hot glue to draw designs on your wand.",
        "You can use the hot glue to build up a handle for your wand; they are typically the length of your finger.",
        "You can also use the glue gun to draw swirly designs on the rest of the wand.",
        "If you'd like, you can hot glue fancy beads or buttons to the handle to make fancy designs.",
        "Seal the wand with some primer.",
        "You want using paint primer, gesso, or even decoupage glue (such as Mod Podge).",
        "Allow the primer to dry before continuing.",
        "This will prevent the paper from becoming too soggy while you paint it.",
        "If it becomes soggy, it can fall apart.",
        "Paint the wand a base color using acrylic paint.",
        "Most wands will be some shade of brown, but there are wands in the movies that are also black or white.",
        "You can paint your wand a solid color, or different shades of the same color.",
        "For example, you could paint your wand brown, and add some lighter and darker brown streaks to it to make it look more like wood.",
        "Add some weathering and let the wand dry.",
        "This will make the designs you drew stand out more.",
        "Take a color that's slightly darker than the one you used, and apply it with a paintbrush or q-tip to all of the nooks and crannies in your design.",
        "Next, take a lighter color, and apply some highlights to all of the raised edges.",
        "If your wand is black, you only need the highlights.",
        "If your wand is white, you only need the shadows.",
        "Seal the wand, if desired.",
        "This is not completely necessary, but it will help your wand last a little longer.",
        "Go to a well-ventilated area, and set the wand down on a sheet of newspaper.",
        "Spray the wand with a clear, acrylic sealer and let it dry.",
        "Turn the wand over and spray the other side as well.",
        "Repeat this step if necessary.",
        "You can use a matte, satin, or glossy finish."
