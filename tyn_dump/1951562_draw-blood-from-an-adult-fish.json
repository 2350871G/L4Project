Make sure that the water is the same temperature and pH as the water the fish normally lives in. Anesthetizing a fish is appropriate for short procedures that need to be performed out of the water, such as drawing blood. The fish will temporarily lose all sensation including the ability to feel pain, and will become unresponsive so that you will be able to safely perform the procedure."

Tricaine is the most common anesthetic for fish and comes in a powder that you can weigh out into doses, or premixed in a solution to be added to a certain volume of water. In general, dosages range from 15-50 mg/L of water in the holding tank, but you should consult with a veterinarian to determine the proper dosage for the fish that you want to anesthetize. It is not recommended to attempt to anesthetize a fish if you do not know what dosage to give it, as an overdose could cause death."

Anesthesia is only suitable for procedures that can be performed in less than 5 minutes. An overdose of anesthesia can be used as a humane form of euthanasia. A blood sample can be drawn from either an anesthetized or freshly-euthanized fish."

Your blood sample is now ready for processing. Make sure to also disinfect the area where the fish was handled. Return the fish to its home tank to recover.
