However, a temporary way to fix the draft is to paint over the crack with clear nail polish. Allow the nail polish to dry completely and add another coat if needed. You may need to paint on 2 to 3 coats to ensure that the crack is fully covered. Keep in mind that you will still need to replace the window eventually. The nail polish will only hold for 1 to 2 months at most."
