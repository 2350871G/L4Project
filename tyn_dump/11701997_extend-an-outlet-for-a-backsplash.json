Mount the tiles around the outlet as close as you can get them to the edges of the outlet box without covering up either of the mounting straps. The outlets mounting straps are the 2 metal brackets at the top and bottom or left and right of the outlet, depending how it is oriented. These are the brackets that screws go through to hold the outlet to the outlet box in the wall. Don\u2019t try to extend the outlet before the tiles are on the wall because it will be very difficult to get the spacing just right if you do it that way. It\u2019s much easier to wait until the backsplash is done so you can space the outlet perfectly according to the thickness of the tiling. This method can be used to extend any kind of electrical outlet, including those with plugs or light switches."
