    "text": " Cardboard Box Room Find a nice big cardboard box. Set it out in some free space of your room. Make a carpet for your stuffed animal's room. Choose fabric that is nice and soft, such as polar fleece or an old unwanted woolen/cashmere sweater or even a unwanted blanket. Finger paint words onto the walls. Add words such as the stuffed animal's name, initials or words that correspond with its personality. You can draw pictures too! Make a bed for the stuffed animal. This could be a scarf, folded up. You could tuck any fabric inside a small box to make an easy bed. If you have cardboard flaps that you're using as doors, measure out the length of your pet. Go around it in tape; make sure it's bigger than your stuffed animal. Paint it, cut and take the tape off. Add to the box, so that your stuffed animal can get in by itself. Add some furniture. If you have old dollhouse furniture, add that to the house. Cut paper to size fold over a small part of it and glue it to the wall like the table. Put your animal inside. Throw a housewarming party to make your little friend feel loved. Laundry Basket Room Find an empty laundry basket. If you can't find one, ask your parent or guardian for help. Or just buy one. Put a blanket for the carpet on the floor of the basket. It doesn't have to be brand new. Make a bed out a small cloth folded up.  If you have some Styrofoam, cut out a square. Put that square next to the furby's or stuffed animal's bed to serve as a side table. Put a book, lamp and things onto it. Feed the stuffed animal. Then put it down for a nap. Drawer Room Open up your chosen drawer. Check if you have enough space for your toy. The best type of drawer would be the one in your bedside table or any drawer in your bedroom. Place a soft fabric inside your drawer. If you're allowed to, stick the fabric to the floor of your drawer with hot glue. Velvet or silk would work best as the lining fabric. Add a bed.
