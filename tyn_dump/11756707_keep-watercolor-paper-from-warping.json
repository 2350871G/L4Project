Lighter weight paper is thinner and will more easily buckle and warp when you apply your watercolor paint. For more absorbency and less warping, go with a watercolor paper that is weighted at either 300lb (638 gsm) or more.Note: Heavier paper is thicker and often has a more textured surface, which can make it difficult to create detailed paintings."

For a less expensive, but still effective option, go with paper labeled as cold-pressed. Hot-pressed paper has a smooth surface and will buckle more easily whenever you apply your watercolor paint to it. 300 lb (638 gsm) cold-pressed watercolor paper can cost between $10-$20 per ream."
