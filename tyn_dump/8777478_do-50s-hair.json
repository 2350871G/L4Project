Try to make the parts on the left and right sides of your head as even as possible. If you have shorter hair on the sides, simply use the fade as a guide. Start combing your hair up and back. Use a fine-toothed comb to comb the hair above your eyebrow up towards the middle of your head, and back towards your crown. Repeat for the other side of your head. You are going for something cone-shaped. Only comb the hair above the part. Don't worry about forming the pomp yet. Comb the sides of your hair, if needed. If you have longer hair on the sides of your head, you will need to brush it into place. Use a boar bristle brush to comb the hair below the part at a downward angle towards the nap of your neck. Do this for both sides of your head. Only comb below the part. If you have shorter hair on the sides of your head, you may need to comb it downward slightly to make the part more pronounced. Start forming the pomp. Go back to the hair above the two parts you made. Slide a dressing comb with long bristles into your hair at the hairline. Slowly pull the comb upwards, keeping it parallel to your head. When you reach the height you want your pomp to be, pull the comb out. If you don't have a dressing comb, another way to form a pompadour would be to use a round brush and a blow dryer. Brush the hair out and up to create volume. Next, apply product, such as pomade, to hold to pompadour in place. Use bobby bins the same color as your hair to secure the style, if needed. Finish forming the pomp. Continue combing your hair upwards at the hairline using short, upward strokes, until your hair bumps out at the front. It can be as high or as low as you want it to be. If any hairs at the sides of the pomp get out of place, comb them back into place. Dig the comb deeper into your hair at the roots, and shallower at the ends. Keep your free hand on the crown of your head\u2014it should be lightly touching your hair, not pressing down. This will help further shape the pomp at the front.",
