A running stitch is where you weave the needle up and down through the fabric. Use thread in a color that matches the patch for a seamless look. Use embroidery floss in a contrasting color for a punky look. Complete the punky look by adding safety pins and/or studs to your item.

    "text": " Cutting T-Shirts into Squares Spread the T-shirt you want to use on a flat surface. Smooth out any ripples or wrinkles from the shirt, and make sure that the hems are aligned. If you are using a printed T-shirt, keep the design facing up so that you can see where you are cutting. Plain T-shirts work great for rags as well as scraps for other sewing projects, such as toys. Printed T-shirts work great for bags, quilts, and patches. Cut across the T-shirt with fabric scissors, just below the sleeves. If you need to, use a ruler and a marker to draw a horizontal line across the front of the shirt first, then cut along the line that you drew. Set the top part containing the sleeves aside. Alternatively, you can use a ruler and a rotary cutter to cut across the shirt. If you are using a printed T-shirt, cut the sleeves off first, then cut straight across the shirt, 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) above the design. Turn the shirt inside-out and cut the side seams off. Turn the shirt inside out first, then set it down on a flat surface. Smooth out any wrinkles, then cut the side seams off along the stitching. Set the 2 pieces aside when you are done. Use fabric scissors or a rotary cutter to do this. If you want to, you can cut the bottom hem off too. Use fabric scissors to cut a rectangle from the top part of the shirt. Go back to the top part of the shirt that you set aside earlier; it's the part with the sleeves. Use a ruler and marker to draw the largest rectangle you can between the sleeves, bottom of the collar, and cut edge. To save more fabric, do the front of the shirt first, then the back. The collar is usually bigger in the front than in the back. Cut the sleeves apart with fabric scissors to make rectangles. Cut the sleeves off the remaining fabric first. Next, turn them inside-out, then cut the seam off. Spread the sleeves flat, and cut across the top (shoulder) edge to make them more rectangular. You can leave the bottom edge hemmed, or you can cut the hem off. You can use a rotary cutter for this. Use the scraps. These rectangular pieces are perfect for sewing together into a quilt or blanket. Make them easier to work with by ironing fusible interfacing to the back. You can also cut the pieces up further to sew into a simple doll, teddy bear, or cat toy. Creating T-Shirt Yarn Get a plain T-shirt without any side seams. If the shirt has side seams, they will come apart once you go to cut the T-shirt into yarn. Also, do not use a T-shirt that has an image printed onto it, like a band logo or a comic book character, as this will prevent the shirt from stretching. Cut the top of the shirt off below the armpits. Spread your T-shirt on a flat surface. Place a ruler across the shirt, just under the armpits. Cut across the shirt with a rotary cutter, using the ruler as a guide. Discard the top part of the shirt, along with the sleeves. If you don't have a rotary cutter, use the ruler and a marker to draw a horizontal line instead, then cut across the line with fabric scissors. Cut the hem off of the shirt. While not absolutely necessary, this will help make your yarn more consistent in thickness and texture. Simply cut straight across the bottom hem just above the stitching. You can do this with a ruler and rotary cutter, or with fabric scissors. Discard the hem when you are done. You don't need it. Fold the shirt in half, leaving a gap between the left and right edges. Take the left side of the shirt and pull it towards the right. Stop when there is a 1-inch (2.5-cm)  gap between the left side edge and the right side edge. This will reduce the amount of cutting that you have to do. Cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits into the side of the shirt, stopping at the gap. Begin cutting on the left side of the shirt, and finish cutting 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the right side. If you were to unfold your shirt, you would see 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide strips running across it, and stopping 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the right side edge. Unfold the shirt and spread it so that gap in the right side edge widens. Unfold the shirt first. Next, open it up and spread it out so that the 1-inch (2.5-cm) gap widens into a 2-inch (5.1-cm) gap. You may have to move the loops formed by the cut left side of the shirt out of the way. Cut diagonal lines across the 2-inch (5.1-cm) gap to separate the strips. Begin cutting at the bottom-left corner of the gap. Cut across the gap at an upward angle towards the next horizontal strip. Repeat this process, cutting from the bottom-left to the upper-right until you reach the top of the shirt. Envision the gaps as 1-inch (2.5-cm) tall rectangles. You are cutting from the bottom-left corner to the upper-right corner of each rectangle. Pull on the T-shirt strip to make the ends curl in. Hold the T-shirt strip loosely in 1 hand, and use your other hand to gently pull it through your hand. This will cause the edges of the T-shirt to curl inwards and form a tube-like shape. You may need to do this a few times. Roll the yarn into a ball. Wrap the end of the yarn a few times around your index and middle fingers. Slide the wrapped yarn off your fingers, then wrap the yarn across the loop a few more times to form a ball. Continue wrapping the yarn around the ball, changing direction often, until you run out. Use the yarn to knit or crochet. Because of how thick and bulky this yarn is, it probably won't make very good socks, hats, or scarves. It is great for making items that will see a lot of wear-and-tear, such as dishcloths, pot holders, and rugs, however. Making Crafts with T-shirts Cut the collar and sleeves off, then sew or tie the bottom to make a tote. Cut the sleeves off first, then cut a deep U-shape into the collar. Leave the shoulders intact to create the handles. Turn the shirt inside-out, sew across the bottom hem, then turn it right-side-out again. Alternatively, cut a fringe into the bottom edge, then tie the fringe together. Turn an old shirt into a fringy scarf. Cut the top of a T-shirt off, just below the armpits. Next, cut 2-inch (5.1-cm) strips across the shirt. Start at the left side and stop 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the right. Pull on the strips to make them narrower, then gather the right side together. Wrap and tie a strip of fabric around the right side to hold it together. Cut the thin strips from the leftover material of your shirt. It can come from the hem or sleeve. Cut the printed image out, then use it as a punky patch. Find a T-shirt with a cool printed image, such as a band logo. Cut down the side of the image, and halfway across the top and bottom. Fold the cut side of the in half, then use it as a guide for cutting the rest. Hand sew the patch to your desired item with a simple running stitch. A running stitch is where you weave the needle up and down through the fabric. Use thread in a color that matches the patch for a seamless look. Use embroidery floss in a contrasting color for a punky look. Complete the punky look by adding safety pins and/or studs to your item. Great items to add patches to include: plain T-shirts, backpacks, shoulder bags, totes, and jean jackets. Turn several cut T-shirts into a cozy quilt. Using the square cutting method, cut several T-shirts apart into equal-sized squares. Sew the side edges of the T-shirts together to make a larger rectangle. Cut a large rectangle out of cotton fabric, then sew it to the back of the quilt, leaving a gap for turning. Turn the quilt right-side-out, then sew the gap shut. The T-shirts can be plaint, printed, or a combination of both. The cotton fabric can be woven (plain) or jersey (T-shirt material). Make sure that you are sewing the fabric with the right sides facing in. Press the seams between the T-shirt squares with an iron before turning to reduce bulk. Topstitch down the seams between the T-shirt squares to complete the quilted look. Make a  latch-hook rug from cut-up T-shirt strips. Cut several plain T-shirts into 1 by 4-inch (2.5 by 10.2-cm) strips. Pull on the strips to make them narrower and easier to use. Use a latch-hook to weave these strips onto a latch-hook mesh canvas. You can find latch-hooks and latch-hook mesh canvases in craft stores. For a nicer finish, fold and sew bias tape around the edges.",
