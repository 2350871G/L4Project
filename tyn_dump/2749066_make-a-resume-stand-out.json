In addition, consistent formatting shows that you are neat and pay attention to detail. Use the same font throughout your resume. Times New Roman and Georgia are good serif fonts, and Arial and Calibri are good sans-serif fonts. Use the same size font throughout your resume. Usually this will be a font size of 11 or 12.

Some tinkering of font size can help \"pad out\" the resume of a person just starting out, or squeeze in more experience and accolades of the accomplished individual. Italicize, bold, and underline parallel items on your resume. For example, you can underline all the subtitles on your resume or italicize all contact information. Your font, font size, and other resume choices should match your cover letter and all other material you are sending in. Mismatching fonts or color schemes can distract a reader."
