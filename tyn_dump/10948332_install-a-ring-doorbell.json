Installing a Ring Doorbell without an Existing Doorbell Line up the mounting bracket where you want to install the doorbell. To begin mounting your Ring Doorbell, select a spot on the exterior wall next to your door at about chest height. Snap the level tool included in your Ring kit into the mounting bracket and place the bracket in the desired position, making sure it is level. Check the bubble in the level tool and make sure it is centered between the 2 lines marked on the level. Mark the positions of the mounting holes with a pencil. Once the bracket is positioned the way you like it, take a pencil and make marks on the wall inside the 4 screw holes at each corner of the bracket. If you need to drill holes or install screw anchors in your wall, remove the bracket and set it aside before proceeding. If pencil doesn't show up on your wall, try using a metallic marker (such as a silver Sharpie) instead. Drill holes at the positions you marked if necessary. If your wall is made of a masonry material, such as brick, concrete, or stone, you'll need to use a power drill and a masonry bit to make holes in the wall at the correct positions. The Ring Doorbell kit includes a masonry bit of the right size for installing the anchors that are also provided with your kit.Tip: If you have a wood or vinyl wall but can't get a screw into it easily by hand, try using an electric screwdriver or drilling a pilot hole with a spur point bit before driving in the screws. Once you've made the holes, push the provided screw anchors into the wall by hand or gently tap them in with a hammer or mallet. If you're mounting the doorbell on a wood or vinyl wall, you should be able to install the screws directly into the wall with a screwdriver. Attach the mounting bracket to the wall using screws.

This will make it difficult for you to install the Ring Doorbell correctly. Snap the Ring Doorbell into place on the bracket. Once the bracket is mounted, push the Ring Doorbell device in and down until it snaps into place. You may need to use some force to securely attach the doorbell to the bracket. Make sure to remove the level tool before attaching the doorbell to the bracket. Tighten the security screws on the base of the doorbell. Once your doorbell is in place, use the smaller end of the screwdriver tool to tighten the 2 screws at the bottom of the device. This will help lock the doorbell in place on the mounting bracket. Replacing an Existing Doorbell Shut off the power to your current doorbell. If you're hardwiring your Ring Doorbell to an existing doorbell system, you'll need to shut off power to the old doorbell to prevent accidental shocks or electrocution. Locate your circuit breaker box and switch off the breaker that supplies power to your doorbell.Tip: If you're not sure how to shut off power to your doorbell or if you feel uncomfortable doing the installation yourself, consider calling a professional electrician or home tech support specialist to do the installation for you.

To install the diode, put the black plastic housing between the 2 screws on the front of the mounting bracket and wrap the wires on either side around each of the screws. In order to get your chime working correctly, you'll need to determine which wire is connected to your doorbell's chime mechanism. You may be able to tell by opening the chime and looking at the wires, which may be labeled and/or color-coded. If you know which wire connects to the chime, position the diode so that the grey indicator on the plastic housing faces that wire. If you chose the wrong wire, you'll need to reinstall the diode facing the other way. Don't install the diode if you have a mechanical door chime. Doing so may damage your doorbell. Snap the Ring Doorbell into place on the bracket. Once all the wiring is in place, push the doorbell in and then down to snap it into place on the mounting bracket. You may need to use quite a bit of force to get the doorbell mounted securely. Make sure you remove the level tool from the mounting bracket before trying to install the doorbell. Tighten the security screws on the bottom of the doorbell. To lock your Ring Doorbell securely into place, tighten the 2 security screws at the base of the device using the screwdriver tool from your Ring kit. Make sure to use the smaller end of the tool for this purpose. Turn the power to the doorbell back on. Once your Ring Doorbell is installed, go back to your breaker box and switch the power back on. Then, go test your new doorbell to make sure it is working correctly! You'll know the Ring Doorbell is correctly wired if the indicator light on the front glows soft white. If you have a digital chime and it doesn't work properly with the Ring Doorbell, you may need to remove the device and flip the diode around.",
