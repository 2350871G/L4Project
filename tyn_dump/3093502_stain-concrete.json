Repair moderate damage by filling cracks with a self-sealing concrete crack sealant or putting down a new, thin layer of concrete over heavily worn areas. Stains have a way of accentuating flaws in the surfaces they\u2019re applied to. This means that any imperfections in the concrete may become more visible by the end of your project. If the surface you plan on staining is severely deteriorated, you may want to consider laying new concrete."

Simply use a lighter color as your base coat, then layer a darker shade on top to create depth.Tip: Bring home samples of any stain colors you think you might want to try out.

        "Spray your first coat of stain onto the concrete in 4 ft (1.2 m) sections.",
        "Hold the sprayer wand 20\u201324 inches (51\u201361 cm) away from your work surface and sweep it over the concrete using tight circular motions.",
        "Aim for full, even coverage.",
        "Once you\u2019re done with one section, move onto the next until you\u2019ve completed the entire surface.",
        "Start each application with the tip of the wand inside an old bucket or similar container to build up a steady spray before moving it over to your work surface.",
        "This container will also be useful for catching runoff from the nozzle afterwards.",
        "If you are using 2 different colors to create a marble effect, do not wait to apply the second coat.",
        "You can apply it immediately after the first coat.",
        "Backroll the fresh stain with a \u20448 in (0.95 cm) nap roller.",
        "Move the roller back and forth in all different directions to avoid leaving behind roller marks.",
        "The textured nap will work the stain deeper into the pores of the concrete, eliminating inconsistencies and giving it a more uniform appearance.",
        "You can also use a stiff-bristled brush, paint brush, or sponge to get into tight corners, edges, and other spaces that may be hard to hit directly with larger applicators.",
        "A push broom can come in handy for spreading stain over large areas if you don\u2019t have a roller.Tip: Another option is to place a small amount of diluted stain in a spray bottle and use it to touch up areas that look lighter than the surrounding concrete.",
        "Allow the stain to dry overnight.",
        "Drying times vary by product, so be sure to consult the manufacturer's directions.",
        "In most cases, the stain will dry to the touch within 15-20 minutes and cure fully within 12-24 hours.",
        "Avoid walking on or allowing any other objects to come into contact with the concrete as it\u2019s drying.",
        "Apply a second coat after 2-3 hours if you want a deeper color.",
        "Spray on the follow-up coat the same way you did the first, moving the wand in tight circles and working in 4 ft (1.2 m) sections.",
        "Afterwards, go back over the stain with a roller, brush, or sponge.",
        "It shouldn\u2019t be necessary to apply more than 2 coats of stain in total.",
        "Only apply a second coat of stain if your concrete is porous enough to hold it.",
        "Otherwise, it may be prone to pooling and have difficulty setting.",
        "Let your second coat dry for at least 24 hours before sealing or resuming foot traffic on the stained concrete.",
        "Sealing the Stained Concrete Brush the sealer around the edges of the concrete by hand.",
        "Dip a 3 in (7.6 cm) paintbrush into the sealer and glide it across the outer 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of your work surface in one smooth, thin coat.",
        "This will make it easier to apply to the sections of the perimeter that your roller won\u2019t quite reach.",
        "Most outdoor concrete sealers are made epoxy or acrylic, which are durable, waterproof, and resistant to slips, scuffs, and UV rays.",
        "Indoor sealers tend to be water-based, as these products don\u2019t emit harmful fumes.",
        "Sealing your newly-stained concrete is optional, but many home improvement specialists encourage it as it protects the stain from general wear and tear, prevents the initial color from fading, and lends a polished, glossy finish.",
        "Roll a full coat of sealer onto the remaining surface in one direction.",
        "Start at one edge of your work surface and push the roller across to the opposite edge, then turn, reposition the roller and work your way back.",
        "Repeat this pattern until you\u2019ve covered your entire work surface.",
        "As you did with the stain itself, focus on achieving even, consistent, total coverage.",
        "Don\u2019t be concerned if the sealer looks white immediately after you apply it\u2014it will dry clear.",
        "Let your first coat of sealer dry for 1-2 hours.",
        "Concrete sealers dry to the touch fairly quickly, so you won\u2019t have to wait long before you\u2019re able to apply your second coat.",
        "In the meantime, keep clear of your work surface.",
        "Any contact with the wet sealer could rub it off, leaving patches of the concrete exposed and unprotected.",
        "Check the label of the sealer you\u2019re using for more detailed drying guidelines.",
        "Apply a second coat of sealer perpendicularly to the first.",
        "For this coat, roll on each section at a 90-degree angle to the direction you went with your first coat.",
        "If you applied your first coat vertically, for example, you\u2019ll apply the second coat horizontally.",
        "Layering your coats in this way will ensure that every last crack, crevice, and depression gets filled with the sealer.",
        "Be careful not to slather on either coat too thick.",
        "Doing so could cause bubbles or large larger blisters to form in the cured finish.Tip: It may help to walk backwards with the roller to avoid stepping on the section of concrete you just rolled.",
        "Allow the sealer to cure for 24 hours.",
        "Curing is different from drying, as this is when the sealer will harden to its true finish.",
        "After a full day, your concrete surface will be ready to use!",
        "If you choose to seal your work surface, it will be important to apply a fresh coat of sealer every 3-4 years to keep it looking its best."
