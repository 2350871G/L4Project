                    "description": "Inspect the floor carefully for deep cracks, gouges, and places that have sunken due to continual wear. Fill in these areas by slathering a small amount of patching compound directly over the problem area using a hand trowel. Smooth the compound with the flat side of the trowel and use the edge to work it further into deep openings. Allow the patching compound to cure completely before proceeding. This may take 1-4 hours, depending on the exact product you use. You can find pre-mixed patching compound at any hardware store or home improvement center. Unless your floor is severely damaged, you'll most likely only need a small bucket."

Work your way gradually from one end of the room to the other, focusing on areas that are marred by obvious imperfections, such as divots and uneven textures, as well as the places you filled in with patching compound. Polishing may not be necessary if your concrete floor is relatively new. However, it\u2019s a good idea to go ahead with the process if the concrete shows any paint splotches, oil stains, or similar residue. If you\u2019re staining a concrete floor that was previously covered with tile, you'll need to use a floor grinder equipped with diamond bits to remove stubborn scraps of dried mortar from the floor. You may need to use an extension cord to polish large rooms like foyers or galleries."

If you want to etch your floor, pick up a bottle of etching acid and follow the specific instructions laid out on the label. Most types of chemical etching agents need to be mixed with warm water and scrubbed onto the floor using a rigid brush. Not all concrete stains require the surface to be etched\u2014in fact, some products advise against it. Be sure to read the recommended uses of the stain you\u2019re working with before you attempt to etch your floor. When applied correctly, the etching acid will create tiny imperfections in the smooth concrete, making it easier for substances like stains to permeate the surface."

        "Consider etching the floor to help the stain adhere.",
        "Concrete stains tend to stick better to floors that have been chemically etched prior to application.",
        "If you want to etch your floor, pick up a bottle of etching acid and follow the specific instructions laid out on the label.",
        "Most types of chemical etching agents need to be mixed with warm water and scrubbed onto the floor using a rigid brush.",
        "Not all concrete stains require the surface to be etched\u2014in fact, some products advise against it.",
        "Be sure to read the recommended uses of the stain you\u2019re working with before you attempt to etch your floor.",
        "When applied correctly, the etching acid will create tiny imperfections in the smooth concrete, making it easier for substances like stains to permeate the surface.",
        "Tape off areas you don\u2019t want to come into contact with the stain.",
        "Stretch a roll of painter\u2019s tape along the perimeter of the room where the lower part of the wall meets the floor.",
        "This will prevent the stain from getting anywhere it\u2019s not supposed to be.",
        "You can also cover any parts of the floor you plan on leaving exposed.",
        "Take your time and work carefully to make sure everything is properly protected.",
        "Concrete stain can be extremely difficult to remove once it\u2019s been applied.",
        "Applying the Stain Make sure your work area is as well-ventilated as possible.",
        "For safety's sake, it's important to promote proper airflow in the room you're staining.",
        "Open all doors and windows before getting started, and turn on an overhead fan, portable box fan, or air conditioner to help keep the surrounding atmosphere clear.",
        "Some acid-based etching agents and stains give off fumes that are mildly toxic.",
        "If possible, put on a respirator or dust mask as well to minimize your exposure.",
        "Mix the stain with the recommended amount of water.",
        "Combine the prescribed ratio of stain to water inside a plastic pump sprayer and stir the two liquids together until they form a uniform solution.",
        "Be sure to follow the mixing instructions included with your concrete stain.",
        "The exact ratio of stain to water may vary depending on the exact product used.",
        "A pump sprayer will offer the greatest speed and efficiency.",
        "If you plan on applying the stain with a roller or brush, you\u2019ll need to do your mixing in a large plastic bucket.",
        "Pull on a pair of rubber gloves before you begin mixing the stain.",
        "If you happen to get any on your skin, it may take weeks to wash off!",
        "Start applying the stain at the back of the room.",
        "Regardless of your method of application, you'll want to work your way from the end of the room opposite the door towards the doorway or opening.",
        "That way, you won\u2019t accidentally trap yourself in a corner and be forced to walk through the wet stain to get out.",
        "Even if you work back to front, it\u2019s recommended that you wear a pair of old shoes that you don\u2019t mind potentially getting ruined.",
        "Spray the stain onto the concrete surface using overlapping strokes.",
        "Pump the handle on the top of the sprayer up and down to release the stain in a steady, concentrated mist.",
        "Guide the nozzle of the wand back and forth in a wide figure-8 pattern or alternating vertical and horizontal sweeps.",
        "This will help you achieve more even coverage and prevent seam-lines from developing between each section.",
        "If you\u2019re using a brush or roller, apply the stain in outward-fanning strokes, overlapping each previous stripe by 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) as you go.",
        "Apply just enough stain to produce a thin, even coat.",
        "You don\u2019t want to use so much that puddles form on the surface of the concrete.",
        "Wear rubber gloves and safety goggles while you work to protect yourself from harmful chemicals and stubborn messes.",
        "Use a broom to spread the wet stain.",
        "Push a heavy shop broom across the floor to distribute the fresh stain more evenly.",
        "To ensure a uniform finish, sweep the entire floor from left to right, then go back over it from top to bottom.",
        "Ideally, no one area should be noticeably darker or lighter than another.",
        "Avoid bearing down too hard with the broom, as this may leave behind bristle marks in the wet stain.",
        "Alternatively, you can use a rag to spread the stain by hand using loose circular motions.",
        "The rag approach is slower, but it will help prevent unsightly bristle marks.",
        "Allow the stain to dry for 3-4 hours.",
        "Give the initial coat time to dry to the touch before you move on to testing the color or applying follow-up coats.",
        "The best way to make sure you stain has had enough time to dry is to let it sit overnight, though most products will begin setting within 1-2 hours.",
        "Different types of stains can have drastically different drying times.",
        "As always, be sure to consult your product\u2019s instructions to find out exactly how long to let it set.",
        "Be aware that the color of the newly-stained surface may change slightly as the stain dries.",
        "Wet a small section of the stain to test the color if desired.",
        "Pour a little water over the dried stain on an out-of-the-way part of the floor.",
        "Doing so will give you an idea of how the stain should look after you\u2019ve applied the clear sealer.",
        "If it\u2019s too light for your liking, plan on adding a second or even third coat.",
        "Be sure to soak up the water quickly after checking the color to prevent the stain from blotching or running.",
        "Apply additional coats as needed.",
        "Mix and apply the stain in the same manner as before.",
        "A subsequent coat may be necessary If the initial coat came out too light, or if there are visible seam lines or bristle marks in the finish.",
        "Remember to spray, roll, or brush the stain on in an alternating pattern to minimize the appearance of stroke lines.",
        "Allow each coat to dry for 3-4 hours before determining whether additional coats are still needed.",
        "Sealing the Stain Let the stain dry for 12-24 hours.",
        "After applying your final coat of stain, allow up to 24 hours for it to dry and set completely.",
        "If it\u2019s not properly cured by the time you add the sealant, it may smudge, streak, or end up thinner in some areas than others.",
        "The longer you let your stain dry, the better.",
        "Even if it\u2019s dry to the touch, the reaction caused by introducing the sealant may weaken its hold on the concrete.",
        "Scrub the floor with a mild all-purpose cleaner to ensure that it\u2019s clean.",
        "Combine equal parts cleanser and water in a separate bucket.",
        "Dip a clean, lint-free cloth into the cleaning solution and swab every inch of the stained concrete.",
        "Allow the floor to dry completely.",
        "Review the instructions that came with your stain.",
        "Some stains recommend adding baking soda to the cleaning solution to neutralize unwanted chemical reactions.",
        "If you don\u2019t clean your newly-stained floor before sealing it, dust particles could become permanently trapped in the sealant layer.",
        "Roll the sealant onto the stained floor using a low-nap roller.",
        "To simplify the cleanup process, pour your sealant into a paint tray before you get started.",
        "Apply a small amount of sealant to the roller, then glide the roller back and forth over the concrete to spread the sealant into a thin layer.",
        "Work in 4\u20135 ft (1.2\u20131.5 m) sections from the back wall to the doorway until you\u2019ve completed the entire floor.",
        "For best results, use the type of sealant recommended by the manufacturer of your particular stain.",
        "Interior concrete floors are typically sealed with wax.",
        "For high-traffic areas, however, urethane-coated epoxy sealants will ensure a resilient, long-lasting finish.",
        "Allow the sealant to cure for 1-2 days before using the floor again.",
        "The sealant must have ample time to harden before you take your first steps on the floor or begin replacing furniture.",
        "To get a more accurate sense of how long this will take, refer to the instructions listed on the label of the sealant you\u2019re working with.",
        "In the meantime, avoid touching the floor for any reason.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t need more than a single even coat of sealant, but if you do decide to use multiple coats, be sure to wait 45 minutes to an hour between applications.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to remove your painter\u2019s tape after the sealant has properly cured."
