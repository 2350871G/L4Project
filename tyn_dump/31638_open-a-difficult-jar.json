The hotter you get the lid, the more it will expand, but be very careful because both the lighter and the lid of the jar will get very hot! Getting a Better Grip on the Lid Try twisting off the lid with a dry dish towel. Sometimes a towel is all you need to give you the extra grip to twist off a stubborn lid. Hold the jar in your non-dominant hand and place the towel over the lid, then twist it counterclockwise. It\u2019s a good idea to try opening difficult jars over the sink or a counter. This way, it will be easy to clean up anything that spills out if the lid suddenly comes off quickly. Put on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves to give your hands more traction. Put on a dry pair of kitchen gloves that you would normally use to wash dishes or clean. Try to twist off the lid of the jar as normal. You can use a single glove if you feel like you have better grip on the body of the jar with your naked hand. Place plastic wrap over the lid to get a better grip. Tear off enough plastic wrap from a roll to cover the lid of the jar. Place it over the top and press it down around the rim until it clings to the lid, then twist the lid off. Note that the more clingy the plastic wrap, the more likely this method is to work. Stretch a rubber band around the lid to add grip as an alternative to plastic wrap. Get a rubber band that can fit tightly around the lid of the jar and stretch it around the rim. Use your dominant hand to grip the rubber band and try to twist the lid off. Tip: Wider rubber bands work best for this method, so that there is more surface area to grip onto. Try using a dryer sheet for extra grip if you have one handy. A dryer sheet is another option to create traction for your hands. Place a dryer sheet over the lid and twist the lid off. You could try combining this method with the rubber band method by placing a rubber band over the dryer sheet to hold it more securely in place.",
