    "text": " Making No-Sew Leg Warmers Find an old sweater. If you don\u2019t own a sweater you want to deconstruct, you can find them for $1 to $10 at a thrift store. Choose wool sweaters, if you want the most durability. You will need to wash them by hand to avoid changing the texture. Choose acrylic if you don\u2019t need to wash sweaters regularly. Many acrylic blends tend to pill over time. Choose cotton blends for the easiest care and durability. Cut off the sweater sleeves with a pair of fabric scissors. Choose a portion just outside of the shoulder hem. You can reuse the remaining sweater for other projects. Place the sleeves on a craft table or flat surface. Smooth them down so there aren\u2019t any creases. Use a straight edge to cut a straight line across the top of the sweater sleeve.  Try them on. You can wear them pulled straight or scrunched up. If you want a shorter leg warmer, you can cut your top line lower on the sleeve. Employ safety pins to keep leg warmers taught at the top, if you want to wear them as knee-highs or thigh-highs.  Making Leg Warmers By Sewing Find a wool, cotton or acrylic long-sleeved sweater. Choose a sweater with a cuff at the bottom of the sleeves and body. Buy it from the thrift store or use an old sweater. Cut the arms off at the shoulder seam. Use fabric scissors to limit the unraveling of the threads. Cut the bottom hem off on the body of the sweater. You can discard the remainder of the sweater or use it for other projects. Smooth the sweater sleeves down onto a flat surface. Cut a straight line from the top arm. It should start next to the armpit and extend horizontally across the sleeve. Use a fabric measuring tape to take a measurement of the circumference just below the knee, or the highest point on your leg where you plan to wear the leg warmer. Subtract 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the measurement to ensure it will stay taught. Sweater fabric stretches when pulled. Cut the bottom hem into 2 pieces of this length. You are going to make fold over bands for the top of your leg warmers. Load your sewing machine with thread that matches the sweater material.  Pin the small piece of the bottom hem into a loop. 1 side should already be hemmed and the other side should be cut. Repeat with the second piece. Sew vertically across the 2 bands where they meet.  Attach the outside of the hem band to the inside of the sleeve. You will need to pin it carefully, ensuring that the circle does not get pinned together at any point. Sew around the loop carefully. Use close stitches and a backstitch to prevent future fraying. Fold the band down. Attach buttons, ribbons or other embellishments to the outside of the fold-over. Wear over bear legs, leggings or boots. Instead of making a foldover band on your leg warmers, you can fold the sweater over a piece of elastic that is measured for your calf size. Turn the leg warmer inside out, stretch the elastic band around and pin the sweater down. Stitch it into place, keeping the elastic free of the stitch. Making Faux-Fur Leg Warmers Find a ream of fluffy, plush material at your local fabric store. Any type of synthetic faux fur should do. Buy 1 yard (1 m) of fabric. You can use less if you want to make short boot covers instead of leg warmers that extend to your knees. Take measurements with a fabric measuring tape. Measure the circumference at the top of your shin. You will want the area just below the knee. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the measurement to ensure the elastic is not too tight. Measure the circumference at the widest part of your calf. Measure the area at the bottom. If you want it to cover various sizes of boots as well as legs, try a 22-inch (56 cm) measurement. Measure the length of your leg from just under the anklebone to the top of your shin. Cut 2 pieces of plush faux fur. They should be as wide as the length of your leg and as long as the circumference at the widest point at your calf. Give yourself 1/2 inch extra in length to account for seams. Lay the material on a flat table with the inside out. Measure 3 horizontal lines at approximately ankle, mid-calf and an inch below the top of the shin. Pin 3 lengths of elastic across these lines. Pin it closer together at the ankle and top of the shin, if your measurements were drastically different. This will ensure a tight fit. Sew the 3 lengths down, stretching the elastic as you go.  Fold the leg warmer in half. Pin the 2 sides together as close to the edge as possible. Sew the vertical length of the leg warmer. Faux fur should hide the seam. You can also wrap the leg warmer into a loop and sew as far in as you can on the sewing machine. You may need to hand sew the middle portion, if you cannot sew all the way down to the bottom without sewing through your leg opening. You do not need to sew the top or bottom edges when using acrylic fabrics. Repeat with the second leg warmer. Wear over tights or boots.",
