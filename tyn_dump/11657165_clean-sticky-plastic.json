Add an equal amount of water, then stir the mixture with a spoon until it turns into a paste.Warning: Don\u2019t use this method to clean something like the keys on a plastic keyboard because the paste could get inside easily and damage the electronics. The amount of baking soda and water you need to use depends on how large the plastic item you want to clean is. For example, if it is something small, like a TV remote, you can use about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water and 1 tbsp (20 g) of baking soda. This method works to clean a variety of sticky plastic items like plastic kitchen utensils or dishes, TV remotes, plastic containers, toys, and many other types of solid plastic items."

If you are cleaning something with batteries, like a TV remote, make sure to open up and wipe out the battery compartment as well in case any paste got inside.
