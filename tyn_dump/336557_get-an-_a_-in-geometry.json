Learning the Concepts of Geometry Know Euclid\u2019s five postulates of geometry. Geometry is founded upon the basis of five postulates put together by the ancient mathematician, Euclid. Knowing and understanding these five statements will help you understand many of the concepts in geometry. 1: A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. 2: Any straight line segment can be continued in either direction indefinitely in a straight line. 3. A circle can be drawn around any line segment with one end of the line segment serving as the center point and the length of the line segment serving as the radius of the circle. 4. All right angles are congruent (equal). 5. Given a single line and a single point, only one line can be drawn directly through the point that will be parallel to the first line. Recognize the symbols used in geometry problems. When you first start learning geometry, the various symbols can seem overwhelming. Learning what each of them means and being able to immediately recognize them will make things easier. Here are some of the most common geometry symbols you will come across:\nA small triangle refers to the properties of a triangle. A small angle shape refers to the properties of an angle. Letters with a line over them refer to the properties of a line segment. Letters with a line over them with arrows at each end refer to the properties of a line. One horizontal line with a vertical line in the middle means that two lines are perpendicular to each other. Two vertical lines mean two lines are parallel to each other. An equal sign with a squiggly line on top means that two shapes are congruent. A squiggly line means that two shapes are similar. Three dots forming a triangle means \u201ctherefore\u201d. Understand the properties of lines. A line is straight and extends infinitely in both directions. Lines are drawn with an arrow at the end to indicate that they continue on. A line segment has a beginning and an end point. Another form of a line is called a ray: it only extends infinitely in one direction. Lines can be parallel, perpendicular, or intersecting. When two lines are parallel they never intersect with each other. Perpendicular lines are two lines that form a 90\u00b0 angle. Intersecting lines are two lines that cross each other. Intersecting lines can be perpendicular, but can never be parallel. Know the different types of angles. There are three different types of angles: obtuse, acute, and right. An obtuse angle is one that measures greater than 90\u00b0, an acute angle is one that measures less than 90\u00b0, and a right angle is one that measures exactly 90\u00b0. Being able to identify angles is an important part of geometry. A 90\u00b0 angle is also a perpendicular angle: the lines make a perfect corner. Understand the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem states that a + b = c. It is the formula that allows you to calculate the length of the side of a right triangle if you know the lengths of the other two sides. A right triangle is a triangle with one 90\u00b0 angle. In the theorem, a and b are the opposite and adjacent (straight) sides of the triangle, while c is the hypotenuse (angled line) of the triangle. For example: Find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with side a = 2 and b =3. a + b = c\n2 + 3 = c\n4 + 9 = c\n13 = c\nc = \u221a13\nc = 3.6 Be able to identify the types of triangles. There are three different types of triangles: scalene, isosceles, and equilateral. A scalene triangle has no congruent (identical) sides and no congruent angles. An isosceles triangle has, at least, two congruent sides and two congruent angles. An equilateral triangle has three identical sides and three identical angles. Knowing these types of triangles helps you identify properties and postulates associated with them. Remember, that an equilateral triangle is technically also an isosceles triangle, because it does have two congruent sides. All equilateral triangles are isosceles, but not all isosceles triangles are equilateral. Triangles can also be classified by their angles: acute, right, and obtuse. Acute triangles have angles that are all less than 90\u00b0; right triangles have one 90\u00b0 angle; obtuse triangles have one angle that is greater than 90\u00b0. Know the difference between similar and congruent shapes. Similar shapes are those that have identical corresponding angles and corresponding sides that are proportionally smaller or larger than each other. In other words, the polygon will have the same angles, but different side lengths. Congruent shapes are identical; they are the same shape and size. Corresponding angles are identical angles in two shapes. In a right triangle, the 90-degree angles in both triangles are corresponding. The shapes do not have to be the same size for their angles to be corresponding. Learn about complementary and supplementary angles. Complementary angles are those angles which add together to make 90 degrees and supplementary angles add to 180 degrees. Remember that vertical angles are always congruent; similarly, alternate interior and alternate exterior angles are also always congruent. Right angles are 90 degrees, while straight angles are 180. Vertical angles are the two angles formed by two intersecting lines that are directly opposite each other. Alternate interior angles are formed when two lines intersect a third line. They are on opposite sides of the line they both intersect, but on the inside of each individual line. Alternate exterior angles are also formed when two lines intersect a third line; they are on opposite sides of the line they both intersect, but on the outside of each individual line. Remember SOHCAHTOA. SOHCAHTOA is a mnemonic device used to remember the formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent in a right triangle. When you want to find the sine, cosine, or tangent of an angle, you use the following formulas: Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse, Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse, and Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent. For example: Find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 39\u00b0 angle of a right triangle with side AB = 3, BC = 5 and AC = 4.\nsin(39\u00b0) = opposite/hypotenuse = 3/5 = 0.6\ncos(39\u00b0) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 4/5 = 0.8\ntan(39\u00b0) = opposite/adjacent = 3/4 = 0.75 Writing a 2-Column Proof Draw a diagram after reading the problem. Sometimes the problem will be provided without an image and you will have to diagram it yourself to visualize the proof. Once you have a rough sketch that matches the givens in a problem, you might need to re-draw the diagram so that you can read everything clearly and the angles are approximately correct. Make sure to label everything very clearly based on the information provided. The clearer your diagram, the easier it will be to think through the proof. Make some observations about your diagram. Label right angles and equal lengths. If lines are parallel to each other, mark that down as well. If the problem does not explicitly state two lines are equal, can you prove that they are? Make sure you can prove all of your assumptions. Write down the relationships between various lines and angles that you can conclude based on your diagram and assumptions. Write down the givens in the problem. In any geometric proof, there is some information that is given by the problem. Writing them down first can help you think through the process needed for the proof. Work the proof backwards. When you are proving something in geometry, you are given some statements about the shapes and angles, then asked to prove why these statements are true. Sometimes the easiest way to do this is to start with the end of the problem. How does the problem come to that conclusion? Are there a few obvious steps that must be proved to make this work? Make a 2-column grid labeled with statements and reasons. In order to make a solid proof, you have to make a statement and then give the geometric reason that proves the truth of that statement. Underneath the statement column, you will write a statement such as angle ABC = angle DEF. Under the reason, you will write the proof for this. If it is given, simply write given, otherwise, write the theorem that proves it. Determine which theorems apply to your proof. There are many individual theorems in geometry that can be used for your proof. There are many properties of triangles, intersecting and parallel lines, and circles that are the basis for these theorems. Determine what geometric shapes you are working with and find the ones that apply to your proof. Reference previous proofs to see if there are similarities. There are too many theorems to list, but here are a few of the most important ones for triangles:\nCPCTC: corresponding parts of the congruent triangle are congruent\nSSS: side-side-side: if three sides of one triangle are congruent to three sides of a second triangle, then the triangles are congruent\nSAS: side-angle-side: if two triangles have a congruent side-angle-side, then the two triangles are congruent\nASA: angle-side-angle: if two triangles have a congruent angle-side-angle, then the two triangles are congruent\nAAA: angle-angle-angle: triangles with congruent angles are similar, but not necessarily congruent Make sure your steps flow in a logical fashion. Write down a quick sketch of your proof outline. Write down the reasons for each step. Add the given statements where they belong, not just all at once in the beginning. Re-order the steps if necessary. The more proofs you do, the easier it will be to order the steps properly. Write down the conclusion as the last line. The final step should complete your proof, but it still needs a reason to justify it. When you have finished the proof, look it over and make sure there are no gaps in your reasoning. Once you have determined that the proof is sound, write QED at the bottom right corner to signify it is complete.",

        "They are on opposite sides of the line they both intersect, but on the inside of each individual line.",
