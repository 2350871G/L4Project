If you're unsure of what kind of gravel would be best for your fish, ask a pet-store employee for help. Fill a 5 US gal (19,000 ml) bucket with the gravel. Open the bag of gravel and pour it into a bucket. Only rinse 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of gravel at a time. If you need to clean more than 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of gravel at a time, clean the gravel in separate batches.

Then, take the strained gravel and place it in different dry bucket. Straining 1 pound (450 g) of the gravel at a time will make rinsing it more manageable. Dechlorinating the Gravel Read the instructions on your dechlorinating chemical. Purchase dechlorinated water online or at a pet store. Read the instructions thoroughly so that you know how much of the chemical you need to add to your water. Dechlorinated water is added to water to make it habitable for fish. Wear rubber gloves when handling the chemical. Fill a bucket with water and add the dechlorinating chemical.

Scoop the gravel into the water slowly so that it doesn't splash. During this time, the dechlorinating chemical will remove harmful chlorine from the gravel. Drain the gravel through a strainer. Scoop the gravel from the bucket to a strainer to strain out the dechlorinated water. Once it's strained, pour the gravel into a different, dry bucket. Your gravel is now clean and not harmful for the fish tank environment. Adding the Gravel and Washing the Gravel Add a .5 in (1.3 cm)-thick layer of gravel at the bottom of your fish tank. Gently place the gravel at the bottom of the tank so that you don't scratch or damage the fish tank. Smooth out the gravel with your hands so that it's an even layer. Place rocks and plants over the gravel to give your fish a habitat. Anchor the plants into the gravel so that they don't float to the surface. You can place the rocks on the bottom of the tank in whatever way you think looks best. Add other things like wood or fish tank figurines to give your tank more personality.
