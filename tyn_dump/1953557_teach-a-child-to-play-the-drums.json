Smaller drum sets for junior drummers can be purchased online and at department stores, toy stores, and music shops. These smaller sets are similar to regular-sized drum sets and usually feature a small-scale bass drum, snare drum, a cymbal, and drum sticks. Complete junior drum sets can cost around $300. Some toy drum sets at a toy store can cost between $80 and $150. Consider renting a drum set for your young drummer. Many music stores offer daily, weekly, or monthly rentals. A daily rental can cost around $175, while a monthly rental can cost around $300. Be sure to ask if there are delivery fees for the drum set.

A private instructor will keep the student's technique solid and will establish benchmarks that encourage the child to focus their practice. A weekly one-hour or 30-minute session is plenty to provide the student with direction and instruction in their drumming. Visit a music shop in your town to see if they offer lessons or if they can put you in touch with a local instructor. Approach a local high school band director or faculty member at a university music department to see if any students or instructors offer private drum lessons. Lessons can be between $10 to $60 dollars for 30 minutes of instruction, but this price can vary depending on your location and the instructor\u2019s training and expertise.

The biggest challenge your kid will face will be learning to move each limb independently, With enough practice, though, they'll be able to master these basic rhythms."

        "Gently place one end into the ear canal and hold it there for 20 to 30 seconds as it expands.",
        "If done properly, your child\u2019s voice should sound muffled to them.",
        "Be sure to teach your child how to properly insert the earplugs before playing the drums.",
        "Be sure that their pediatrician is aware that they will be taking lessons and ask if they have any recommendations for protecting the child\u2019s hearing.",
        "Opt for earmuffs to protect their ears.",
        "Earmuffs resemble headphones and completely cover your child\u2019s ear.",
        "They are more expensive than earplugs, but they are easy for your child to put on quickly.",
        "Visit a local department store or music store so your child can try on earmuffs to find the right size and fit.",
        "Be sure that the earmuffs are not too loose and that they seal properly around your child\u2019s ears.",
        "If you child wears glasses, make sure that the earmuffs comfortably fit over them.",
        "Find a private tutor for your child.",
        "A young drummer whose early development consists of undisciplined and unstructured playing will develop bad habits regarding technique, musicianship, and practice.",
        "A private instructor will keep the student's technique solid and will establish benchmarks that encourage the child to focus their practice.",
        "A weekly one-hour or 30-minute session is plenty to provide the student with direction and instruction in their drumming.",
        "Visit a music shop in your town to see if they offer lessons or if they can put you in touch with a local instructor.",
        "Approach a local high school band director or faculty member at a university music department to see if any students or instructors offer private drum lessons.",
        "Lessons can be between $10 to $60 dollars for 30 minutes of instruction, but this price can vary depending on your location and the instructor\u2019s training and expertise.",

        "Poor posture may cause your child\u2019s back or neck to ache, and this discomfort will not encourage your child to keep practicing.",
        "A proper position will also make it easier for your child to access all of the sections of the drum set.",
        "Don\u2019t slouch!",
        "Encourage your child to sit up straight, which will help reduce pressure on their lower back.",
        "Adjust the height of the drummer\u2019s stool so that your child\u2019s feet comfortably reach the pedals.",

        "Learn basic drumming notations.",
        "Although it is not necessary for a child to know how to read music before they begin to learn the drums, it is important that they review and understand sheet music as they progress.",

        "Begin by introducing basic music notations and symbols for standard music before moving on to percussion notations.",

        "Matt Khoury\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVeteran Drummer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMatt Khoury is a seasoned drummer with over 25 years of experience.",
        "He started playing in high-school band and at church, which expanded into opportunities to play with bands in front of thousands of people across the United States.",
        "EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tMatt Khoury, longtime drummer, responded: \"You can start by teaching your kid the standard 4/4 rhythm, where the hi-hat hand plays sequential and evenly spaced quarter notes, 1, 2, 3, 4; the kick drum hits on beats 1 and 3; and the snare drum hits on beats 2 and 4.",
        "The biggest challenge your kid will face will be learning to move each limb independently, With enough practice, though, they'll be able to master these basic rhythms.",
        "Encouraging a Child to Practice Establish short practice sessions.",
        "Long practice sessions may be overwhelming for a young drummer, which may cause your child to lose interest in the instrument or confidence in their abilities.",
        "To keep the practice sessions fun and encouraging, plan the practice schedule with your child.",
        "Asking for their input helps the child feel engaged and in control.",
        "Recommend that they start out with short practice sessions each day for 5, 10, or 15 minutes.",
        "As the child gets older and improves, encourage them to practice longer or until they feel like they have accomplished something.",
        "Set practice goals.",
        "Ask your child to think about the goals they have for each practice session.",
        "One practice session may include learning two bars of a new song, while another session may be geared toward improving drumming eighth note beats.",
        "Having obtainable goals will help the child feel successful and confident after each practice session.",
        "Practice will be associated with positive emotions and achievements rather than frustration or boredom.",
        "Give the child a drum pad for silent practice.",
        "Drum pads are excellent tools for practicing in relative silence.",
        "They have striking surfaces made from gum rubber or neoprene, and can be held in the child's lap or placed on a snare drum stand during practice.",
        "Having a drum pad available will allow the child to practice when playing loudly on a drum set would not be appropriate.",
        "Be positive.",
        "Support your child and inspire them to keep practicing by being positive and encouraging.",
        "Let them know that you are proud of them and that they are doing a great job.",
        "Take an interest in their music, and ask them about what they are currently working on in their lessons.",
        "If your child seems frustrated or upset with their progress, take that opportunity to praise their progress and accomplishments.",

        "Establish a reward system for the amount of time they spend practicing.",
