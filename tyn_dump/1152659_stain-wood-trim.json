Scrape excess filler off the wood with a putty knife. Allow to dry thoroughly according to the package instructions. Sand the patched areas with 220-grit sandpaper until smooth. If necessary, sand the rest of the wood, as well, using 100 to 120 grit for rough areas and a fine 220 grit to make the wood smooth. Wipe down the trim with a tack cloth to remove the sawdust completely. Alternatively, you can use a clean cloth and denatured alcohol. Stain the Wood Shake the stain can vigorously to blend it thoroughly.  Put rubber gloves on to protect your hands from the stain and place drop cloths on the floor to protect it from drips.  Apply the stain using a clean cloth or a stain brush. You can also use a foam brush. Take care to make sure you are applying the stain evenly. Allow the stain to dry for a short time. The longer it sits, the darker the color will be. Some manufacturers recommend allowing the stain to dry for 5 to 15 minutes. Wipe the stain off using a clean cloth.

Add another coat if the color isn't dark enough. Repeat the process as many times as needed to achieve the desired tone. Let the stain dry as long as needed.  Finish the Wood Stir the finish coat gently with a stir stick.  Apply a light coat of varnish or polyurethane in the sheen of your choice. You can pick satin or gloss.
