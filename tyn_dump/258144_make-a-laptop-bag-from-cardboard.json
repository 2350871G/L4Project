Mark these lines. Score all lines with the blunt edge of a ruler or similar object. Scored lines bend easily. Bend the cardboard box along the scored lines.  Lay your laptop on the cardboard so that the scored lines bend around the long edge of your laptop.  Mark the edges of your laptop on the cardboard and then put away the laptop.  Score 1/4(0.25) inch (0.5 cm) away from your laptop's outline (on the outer side) and go all the way around.  Cut the excess cardboard 2 inches(6 cm) away from the scores, so that it forms a wide flap all the way around the laptop's outline. Score all fold lines. Cut narrow wedges at each place so that the cardboard can bend.  Tape the resulting smaller tabs flat against the inside.  Fold the cardboard like a taco.  Line the flaps very carefully at the top end.  Tape the sides together.  Set this inner layer aside and begin work on the outer shell.  This is how your inner box must now look like.  Outer Shell Open up the box base.  Find the center line of the box base.You can either fold it in half or use a ruler.  Mark and score the center line and two lines on either side of it. Each spaced approximately 0.5 inch (1 cm) from each other.There will be five lines, two on either side of the center line. Align the inner shell on the box base. The \"grain\" should lie perpendicular to the grain of the lid (it's stronger that way) and the bottom edge should line up with the outermost scored lines. Trace the inner layer's pattern onto the box bottom.  Measure and mark 0.5 inch(1 cm) away from the outline of the inner shell and the go all the way around.  Add a 3 inch (6 cm) flap to each side of the pattern.  Cut along the outer lines.  Score along the fold lines and cut narrow wedges at the edges of any flaps.  Tape the small flaps down securely.  Fold the \"outer\" cardboard like a taco and tape the short edges securely, leaving the long edge(s) open.  Place the inner layer inside the outer shell.  Tape the inner box to the inside of the outer box.  Slide your laptop inside. You can now make the handle. Handle Ideas Make a handle using a looped rope. Make a loop using two meters (yards) of rope. Pass the rope ends through holes in the flaps. Tie the loop closed. Use the loop ends as handles. Alternative View: Make a handle using a tied loop. Cut the rope a foot long or so (30cm). Pass the ends through holes in the flaps. Tie the ends in a knot. Handle from a single large loop. Make a loop that is only slightly larger than the case. Pass through the holes as shown. Slide loop to open. Slide loop to make \"handles\". Alternative View (Handles made by sliding the rope through holes): Make a handle using a Tee Shirt. Sew the hem edge of a large tee-shirt closed. Slide the case in through the neck opening and use the sleeve openings as your handles. Make a handle using a Rolled Cardboard. Leave largish flaps of cardboard at the box opening. Roll the flaps to form \"scroll like\" handles. Tape well.",
