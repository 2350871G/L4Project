Removing a Broken Window Pane Wear thick work gloves and goggles. When working with broken glass, it's important that you wear the right safety equipment to avoid being cut. Purchase a thick pair of work gloves and safety goggles online or at a hardware store and wear them while you remove and replace the broken window pane. Scrape away the putty around the broken window pane. Use a utility knife, chisel, or putty knife to scrape away the putty surrounding the broken pane. This will loosen the glass and will allow you to remove it easily. Remove any nails or clips with pliers. Some windows will have nails or clips that help hold the pane in place. Use a set of pliers to grab onto any nails or clips in the frame and pull them out. Pull all the shards of glass out of the window frame. Wiggle the pieces of glass that are still stuck to the frame until they come loose. Once they are loose, remove the shards of glass and dispose of them. Continue doing this until there is no more glass in the frame. Sand the area around the broken window with 100-180 grit sandpaper. Smooth out the area around the broken window pane by going back and forth over any remaining putty or sealant. Once the area is smoothed out, wipe the area down with a damp rag to remove any excess particles left over from sanding. Replacing a Broken Window Pane Measure the area around the broken window pane. Use a tape measure to get the length and width of the window frame. Measuring the area will help you determine how big your new piece of glass should be. Subtract \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) from the measurement. The additional space will ensure that the glass will fit in the window and won't crack if the frame expands during cold weather. Purchase a new pane of glass. Go to a hardware or glass store with your measurements and buy a new piece of glass. They will cut your glass to your specifications. If the frame is made out of wood, use a painter's brush to apply a layer of wood sealer around the broken window frame. Let the sealer dry for one or two hours before moving onto the next step. Wood sealer will help the putty or glazing compound adhere to the wood and will help with weather-proofing your windows. Apply putty or a glazing compound around the frame.

Apply putty or glazing compound around the new window. Apply a layer of putty or compound around the edges of the new pane of glass. This will ensure that it's held in place with the putty on both sides of the window and will hold your new glass in place. Smooth the putty out and let it dry. Use a putty knife to smooth out the compound around the new window pane. Remove any excess putty or compound so that it runs flush with the frame and looks clean.
