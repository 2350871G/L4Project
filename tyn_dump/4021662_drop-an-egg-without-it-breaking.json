If you have enough of it, this material can also protect a raw egg from breaking after a nasty tumble. The simplest way to approach this is to get heavy-duty bubble wrap. Carefully wind the bubble wrap around the egg anywhere from two to five times, creating a thick cushion. Tie the ends of the bubble wrap with rubber bands to prevent the egg from slipping out through the top or bottom. If you do not have bubble wrap but do have other packing materials, like packing peanuts, inflated plastic packing packets, packing paper, cotton balls, or crumpled newspaper, you can use these materials to cushion the egg, as well. Spread a thick layer of your chosen packing material inside a box that is at least four to eight times larger than the egg. You should use enough material to fill the box halfway. Place the egg in the center of this cushion, then gently cover it with enough packing material to fill the rest of the box. Close the box and seal it with tape before the drop."

The exact container you use does not necessarily make a difference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind. Make sure that the container is large enough so that you can cushion the egg around all sides, just in case the egg lands on its side instead of on the top or bottom of the container. You also need to make sure that you have enough marshmallows, popcorn, or similar soft food to fill the container completely. If not, the egg might move around inside. Marshmallows and popcorn both work so well because they contain so much air. You could try other types of food, as well, but the food you choose should either be very soft or very airy. Fill the container halfway with marshmallows. Place the egg in the center of your marshmallow nest, then carefully fill the rest of the container with marshmallows, as well.

As a result, the force on the shell is lessened, making it less likely to crack. Cut off one leg of the stockings. Place the egg inside this leg at the center of stocking. Tie the egg in place using rubber bands. Tightly pull the stocking leg diagonally through a box, extending it from one upper corner to one bottom corner. The egg should be positioned in the center of the box. Staple or otherwise hold the stocking in place. Note that your box can be made of nearly any material.

Place six more styrofoam cups inside the bottom cup, on top of the rock. Place the egg inside the top cup. Fit one more cup gently on top of the egg to secure the egg's position. Tape the cups together along the sides so that the container will not fall apart during the fall. If the rock is heavy enough, the container should fall rock-side down and egg-side up.

Since the egg is falling at a slower speed, the force of the impact will be much less once it hits the ground. Less force means that your egg might have a chance at survival. There are a few different parachutes you can try, but one of the easiest materials to use is a plastic shopping bag. Place the egg in a box, along with any cushioning you may choose to use. Attach a large plastic grocery bag to the top of the box using tape or a stapler. Make sure that the handles are near the sides of the box so that enough air can get inside the bag as the box drops. When you drop the box, make sure that the side you attach the parachute to is at the top. This will allow air to fill the bag and cause it to open up, reducing the speed of the descent as a result."

Catching the egg in a net of sorts can increase the deceleration time and reduce the overall force. If you cannot use an actual safety net, a simple alternative is to use a linen sheet. Stake the sheet at least 1 foot (30.5 cm) above the ground. When you drop the egg, make sure that it lands as close to the center of the sheet as possible. Similarly, you could also give the egg a cushion to fall into instead of a net. The principle at work here is the same.

For even better results, drop the egg after a good rainstorm so that the ground is very soft. Try to avoid dropping the egg during a drought, since soil tends to be much harder and more firmly packed in these conditions."

        "When you drop the egg, make sure that it lands on the cushion.",
        "Choose a grassy location.",
        "If you can choose the landing site, opt for a grassy location instead of a concrete sidewalk or parking lot.",
        "Grass and soil are naturally softer than concrete or stone, so the force of the impact will automatically be much smaller.",
        "For even better results, drop the egg after a good rainstorm so that the ground is very soft.",
        "Try to avoid dropping the egg during a drought, since soil tends to be much harder and more firmly packed in these conditions."
