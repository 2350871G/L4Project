Formal debates follow a formula, and you\u2019ll want to know that formula like the back of your hand so that you\u2019re prepared. It\u2019s also important because breaking from the formula can lose you points. Usually there is a statement and two or more teams or single debaters will be assigned to either agree or disagree with the idea. You\u2019ll then take turns making your points according to a set period of time. There are a couple of different debate styles (which determine the rules and how the debate works), so you\u2019ll need to know which one you\u2019re using in order to be clear on the rules. It\u2019s a good idea to look into this well in advance and do some research online. Look for words like \u201ccompetitive debate\u201d, \u201cParliamentary debate\u201d, or \u201cOxford debate\u201d. These are some of the styles of debate you might encounter."

There are lots of different kinds of logical fallacies and you'll want to study each one individually in order to learn to recognize and counter it. By pointing out logical fallacies in your opponent's argument, you force them to either accept them and reduce the credibility of their argument, or use their precious time to try and argue that their argument isn't illogical. One of the most common examples of a logical fallacy is called \"ad hominem\", and is about attacking the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. This is often seen in politics. Think of it like \"this guy is a jerk\" vs. \"there is no evidence that this plan will work\". Another common logical fallacy is called \"black or white\". This is when an argument is presented as having only two options, with the outcome they want being presented as the best one. This ignores middle ground and other routes, which may make more sense.

Another sign of a weak argument is if they skim over a crucial point and use very little evidence to back it up. This is usually an indication that there is no evidence and they're mainly drawing the conclusion that they want to draw. For example, someone arguing that guns prevent mass shootings and only using one example in favor of their argument is clearly missing how many examples go in the opposite direction.

Ask yourself if the current argument ties directly back to the topic you're supposed to be dealing with. If it doesn't support one side or the other, the argument is off track. An example of this would be if you are arguing about whether guns prevent mass shootings and they start arguing that anyone that doesn't like guns is racist.

        "Don\u2019t fidget, instead using your hands to talk or keep them pinned in front of you.",
        "Speak clearly and with purpose, avoiding filler language like \u201cumm\u201d and \u201cahh\u201d.",
        "Just a few adjustments will have you seeming much more sure of yourself.",
        "Choosing Your Arguments Use arguments based on logic.",
        "Arguments based on logic, sometimes referred to as \u201clogos\u201d in the study of arguing, use examples and ideas which are rooted in simple, direct reasoning.",
        "These kinds of arguments are especially helpful when debating with someone who considers themselves smart and logical.",
        "They are also good for topics that are \u201cserious\u201d in nature, like politics and economics.",
        "Try to use facts, statistics, and real life examples to make logical arguments.",
        "An example argument would be: \u201cEvidence has shown that rates of teen pregnancy have decreased as more comprehensive sex education has become mandatory in schools.",
        "You can see in this chart\u2026.\u201d Use arguments based on emotions.",
        "Arguments based on emotions, sometimes referred to as \u201cpathos\u201d in the study of arguing, use appeals to people\u2019s heart and emotions.",
        "These kinds of arguments are especially helpful when debating with someone who is prone to strong emotions (showing heightened joy and easily visible sadness).",
        "They are also good for topics that are \u201chuman\u201d in nature, like arguments about social justice, discrimination, or current events with great tolls on society (like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict).",
        "Try to draw on people\u2019s hopes and fears.",
        "Use personal stories and try to make a personal connection with either your opponent or your audience by comparing the situation to something that is close to them.",
        "An example argument would be: \u201cBacking out now would pose an infinitely greater danger to us than if we stayed and tried to fix the problem.",
        "Untold lives could be lost if we leave but if we stay, then we can save lives.\u201d Use arguments based on authority.",
        "Arguments based on authority, sometimes referred to as \u201cethos\u201d in the study of arguing, use appeals to your authority and credibility or that of another who supports your ideas.",
        "These kinds of arguments are especially helpful when debating with someone who is not as experienced in the field or who has a particularly weak argument.",
        "They are also good for topics that are \u201cacademic\u201d in nature, like arguments about medicine, science, or history.",
        "Try to establish your credentials and elaborate on your experience when using arguments like these.",
        "Make sure ahead of time that your opponent is not significantly more experienced than you.",
        "An example argument would be: \u201cI\u2019ve taught for over 30 years and I\u2019ve seen all of these practices first hand.",
        "I know what works in the field and what doesn\u2019t.",
        "Ideals and real life are two very different things.\u201d Winning a Debate Do your research.",
        "The more prepared you are for a debate, the better you'll do.",
        "If you really want to guarantee a win as much as possible, do your research.",
        "When you know a topic backwards and forwards and from all angles, you'll be much better prepared to counter any argument your opponent might dream up.",
        "It's especially important to know the most common arguments for and against both sides of the issue.",
        "When you know what your opponent is likely to emphasize, you'll be able to explain why that's wrong.",
        "Avoid making websites like Wikipedia your main source of information.",
        "It's a good place to start but you should fill in your facts from sources that are experts in whatever topic you're trying to cover.",
        "For example, if you're going to debate about economics, don't quote a Wikipedia fact.",
        "Quote Alberto Alesina, one of the economics professors at Harvard and co-editor of a major academic journal on the topic.",
        "Look for logical fallacies.",
        "Logical fallacies are when the line of reasoning that someone uses is wrong.",
        "Even though the conclusion might be right, the way of getting there is wrong.",
        "This can be used to shed doubt on their conclusion, making your argument look better.",
        "There are lots of different kinds of logical fallacies and you'll want to study each one individually in order to learn to recognize and counter it.",
        "By pointing out logical fallacies in your opponent's argument, you force them to either accept them and reduce the credibility of their argument, or use their precious time to try and argue that their argument isn't illogical.",
        "One of the most common examples of a logical fallacy is called \"ad hominem\", and is about attacking the person making the argument rather than the argument itself.",
        "This is often seen in politics.",
        "Think of it like \"this guy is a jerk\" vs. \"there is no evidence that this plan will work\".",
        "Another common logical fallacy is called \"black or white\".",
        "This is when an argument is presented as having only two options, with the outcome they want being presented as the best one.",
        "This ignores middle ground and other routes, which may make more sense.",
        "Think of it like when you mom says, \"You can get married and have children or you can die old and alone.\"",
        "There's probably some wiggle room in there, right?",
        "Look for weaknesses in their argument.",
        "There are lots of ways in which someone's argument can be weak.",
        "If you find those weaknesses, you can point them out, making your argument look stronger by comparison.",
        "Try:\nLook for places where they've not thought their course of action through to its logical conclusion.",
        "An example of this is the recent Supreme Court decision that companies can have a religion and that employees should be subject to the rules of that religion.",
        "That's maybe more acceptable if the company is traditional Christian than if it's outrageous Pastafarians, right?",
        "Another sign of a weak argument is if they skim over a crucial point and use very little evidence to back it up.",
        "This is usually an indication that there is no evidence and they're mainly drawing the conclusion that they want to draw.",
        "For example, someone arguing that guns prevent mass shootings and only using one example in favor of their argument is clearly missing how many examples go in the opposite direction.",
        "You want to lock in on that and talk about the evidence they passed over.",
        "Keep the topic on track.",
        "This is when your opponent starts arguing about a subject separate from the topic you're supposed to be debating.",
        "When a debate gets off track, that can be a sign that your opponent is running out of solid reasoning and beginning to break down.",
        "Keep an argument on track and you'll be more likely to win.",
        "Ask yourself if the current argument ties directly back to the topic you're supposed to be dealing with.",
        "If it doesn't support one side or the other, the argument is off track.",
        "An example of this would be if you are arguing about whether guns prevent mass shootings and they start arguing that anyone that doesn't like guns is racist.",
        "Be forceful in turning the argument around.",
        "Call them out for changing the topic.",
        "This will point the behavior out to your audience and can make you look more confident and correct."
