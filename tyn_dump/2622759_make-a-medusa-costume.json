Turn the fabric inside-out and use a straight stitch or backstitch to create a sturdy seam along the open side of the garment. Then turn the fabric right-side-out again. Slip it on and secure the open top. While the top is still open, the garment should fall just below your arms. Leave enough of a gap for your arms and head to fit through, but join the rest of the top edge together with brooches, safety pins, or knots. You could also tack the top edge together with a needle and thread at various points. The points at which the top edge come together should be connected to each other by draping arches of fabric, revealing the skin of your shoulders and arms in between each spot.

Make any necessary adjustments to the curls and snakes in your hair, holding them in place using hairspray, wire, and hot glue as needed. Other Snake Hair Braid your hair. Create many small braided ponytails, using all your hair. You should aim for at least 10 to 12 braids, but the more braids you have, the better. If you have short hair, you can add hair extensions or use a wig. You could also use a wig if you have long hair but want something that will be easier to work with. Simply braid and work with the wig before placing it on your head. Tie each braid off with a small elastic or rubber band. Leave your hair down or pin it up. The simplest option is to leave your hair down, but for a more elegant look, you can also pin your braids into a bun at the top of your head. For a more traditional, snake-covered style, leave your hair down. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7b\\/Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7b\\/Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nFor something a little more classy and subdued, wrap the braids into a bun and pin it to the top of your head. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Medusa-Costume-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Weave the snakes into your hair.

For the simplest approach, buy a Greek goddess costume from the store or wear a Greek-inspired white dress. A Grecian-style dress is traditionally very long, straight and column-like, but it is made from fabric that drapes well and appears very \u201cflowy\u201d. The dress may come over both shoulders or over one shoulder, and it may or may not have sleeves. It usually has some sort of band across the waist. For a more modern, attractive twist, opt for a one-shoulder dress made of draping, flowing fabric that stops just above the knee. Create a no-sew \"peplos\" dress. A peplos gown is a type of ancient Greek gown that was long and worn only by women. Fold a white sheet or large piece of material in half. The width should be a little less than twice the length of your arm span, and the length of the material should be equal to your height plus 18 inches (46 cm). Fold it in half so that it reaches from elbow to elbow. Fold the top 18 inches (46 cm) over. Wrap the fabric around you. The folded portion should be just below your arms, and one side should be open. Fasten the fabric at your shoulders. Bring up enough of the fabric on both sides so that it overlaps on each shoulder. Hold it in place by knotting it or by fastening it with decorative brooches or safety pins. Fasten together the open side. Bring the material together so that it overlaps, and hold it in place with safety pins or by knotting it in several places along the side. If desired, you could also tack it in place with a needle and thread. Tie a belt around your waist. You can either use a white sash or a decorative gold metal belt. Pull extra material up so that it hangs gently and loosely over the belt. Sew an easy \"chiton\" dress. The ancient Greek chiton was worn by men and women, and it could be short or long. Use white material, like a sheet, that is twice the length of your arm span and equal to your height. For a shorter chiton, use material that is a little shorter than your height. Fold the material in half. Fold the width of the material in half so that it extends from fingertip to fingertip. Do not alter the height. Sew along the open seam at your side. Turn the fabric inside-out and use a straight stitch or backstitch to create a sturdy seam along the open side of the garment. Then turn the fabric right-side-out again. Slip it on and secure the open top. While the top is still open, the garment should fall just below your arms. Leave enough of a gap for your arms and head to fit through, but join the rest of the top edge together with brooches, safety pins, or knots. You could also tack the top edge together with a needle and thread at various points. The points at which the top edge come together should be connected to each other by draping arches of fabric, revealing the skin of your shoulders and arms in between each spot. Do not overlap the fabric into a single straight, solid line over your arms. Tie a belt around your waist. Use a white sash or gold metal belt. Pull a little extra material over the belt so that it hangs over slightly. The Make-Up and Accessories Highlight your eyes and lips. You can use heavy make-up for this outfit, covering your entire face with thick coats of gray and green greasepaint. Apply large black circles around your eyes, insert yellow fright-contact lenses, and stage blood to your mouth. Keep in mind that Medusa should be as beautiful as she is horrifying. Apply make-up so that it looks freaky, scary, and very morbid. Use green foundation, As one who lived in relative darkness, Medusa would not have had bronze skin or rosy cheeks. Instead, she would have been fairly pale, with cracked skin that is peeling from her face. Draw attention to your eyes by applying more heavy black eyeliner and black mascara. You can use dark eyeshadow to make your eyes look gaunt, or you could use a bolder metallic shade of green or purple for something a little more subdued and crazy. Use either black lipstick or red lipstick. Go for black lipstick if you want something spooky. To emphasize the more alluring aspect of Medusa, use bright red or deep red lipstick. Apply tooth black out to make your teeth look authentic and decayed. Add horrifying scales. Use facial paint to draw small scales around the top of your forehead, the edges of your face, and along the sides of your hands and feet. You could also use black or green eyeliner to draw the scales, or for 3D effect, cut scales from colored construction paper, and apply with water and flour mixture, or cellophane tape. Note that this is strictly optional. Even without the use of scales, you should still clearly resemble Medusa. Carry around other snakes. You could wear a large rubber snake around your shoulders or waist, or weave a smaller one around your fingers. Hold a rubber snake in each hand, or glue using skin-adhesive squares. If wrapping a large snake around you, make it large enough so that it coils around you without needing to be held in place. Opt for simple footwear. Flat, gold or beige sandals work best. Paint all exposed skin with green tempera paint (non-toxic). Use a lot of jewelry. Antique-looking earrings, bracelets, or brooches can be worn, but don't worry about getting too fancy or too gaudy because the Medusa was a hedonistic demon.",
