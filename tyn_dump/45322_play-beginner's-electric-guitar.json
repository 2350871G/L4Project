You can get this done by the guitar guru at the music store, a professional musician, or the owner of your local guitar repair shop. There are a couple primary benefits to having your guitar set up properly:\nGood intonation. This is maybe the most critical thing. Your guitar should be accurate so that when it's in tune (and you're playing the right notes), it will sound right. If your guitar has bad intonation, it may be in tune on the lower strings, but terribly out-of-tune when playing higher notes. This will be discouraging, and make it much harder to learn. Ease of playing. A guitar that's set up too high can be nearly impossible to play, as it can take an enormous amount of finger pressure to press down the string onto the frets. Not only will this cause intonation problems, it will hurt, and it will slow you down! In time you will develop calluses on your fingers to ease the pain, but it will still be difficult to play fast runs or switch up chords easily."

Don't limit yourself to just the guitar solos\u2014though that's always good to learn\u2014but also listen to the singer, to the bass lines, little fills and noodles from the guitarist. Anything that catches your ear will work\u2014the simpler, the better, as you are learning. For example, the melody to Locked Out of Heaven by Bruno Mars is fairly simple, and has little vocal hooks and phrasings that you can try to imitate with the guitar. Call Me Maybe from Carly Rae Jepsen has a catchy melody, but it also has a distinctive string backup pattern that would be a good challenge. Gangnam Style by Psy has an insistent synth line that starts right at the beginning, and runs throughout the song. While you can't get all the \"synthy\" tone, you can get the basic lick down and then have fun with it! The key here is not to become a guitar legend by learning solos\u2014it's to become a guitar legend by learning to listen and be able to play what you hear.
