    "text": " Doing a Single Crochet Cluster Stitch Make a foundation chain that is a multiple of 2 plus 1 extra stitch. Start with a slipknot, and then loop the yarn over your crochet hook and pull through the slipknot to make your first chain. Yarn over and pull through the loop on your hook to make additional chains. Ensure that the total number of chains in your foundation row is a multiple of 2 plus 1 extra stitch. For example, you could make a chain of 22 since 22 is a multiple of 2 and add 1 stitch for a total of 23. Work 1 single crochet stitch into the second chain from the hook. To single crochet, insert the hook through the second chain. Then, loop the yarn over your hook. Pull the yarn through the chain and yarn over again. Then, pull this yarn through both loops on the hook to complete 1 single crochet stitch. Chain 1, skip the next chain stitch, and single crochet 1 stitch. Loop the yarn over your crochet hook and pull through the other loop on the hook to chain 1. Then, skip over the next chain in the row, and single crochet into the next chain. Repeat this sequence to the end of the chain. Turn your work, chain 1, and single crochet into the first stitch. To work row 2, turn your work so that you are looking at the opposite side of the stitches. Then, make a chain of 1 and single crochet into the first stitch in the row. Chain 1, single crochet 2 together, and chain 1 again. Next, make another chain of 1 stitch, then insert your hook through the next 2 chain spaces from the previous row, yarn over, and pull through both stitches. Then, yarn over again, and pull through 2 again to complete the stitch. Follow this with a chain of 1. Single crochet 2 together and then chain 1. For the rest of the row, follow a sequence of single crocheting 2 together and then chaining 1. This will ensure that you end up with the same amount of stitches at the end of the row as you started with since each decrease will be followed with an increase. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row. Do a single crochet into the last stitch to complete the row. Insert the crochet hook into the last stitch and yarn over. Then, pull through 1 and yarn over again. Pull through 2 to complete the single crochet stitch and the row. Turn your work around, chain 1, and single crochet into the first stitch. To work row 3, turn your work so that you are looking at the opposite side. Loop the yarn over the hook and pull it through to make a chain of 1. Then, single crochet 1 time into the first stitch in the row. Chain 1, skip 1, and single crochet into the next stitch. Make a chain of 1 and then skip 1. Insert the hook into the next stitch in the row and single crochet 1 time into this stitch. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row. Turn your work and repeat rows 2 and 3 again. To continue working in the single crochet cluster stitch, turn your work around so that you are looking at the opposite side. Then, repeat the second and third rows in sequence over the next 2 rows. Keep working rows 2 and 3 in sequence until you have achieved the desired length.Tip: The single crochet cluster stitch creates a textured surface that is great for dishcloths, but it also creates an appealing texture for scarves, hats, and sweaters. Working the Double Crochet Cluster Stitch Loop the yarn over your hook as usual for a double crochet stitch. Bring the working yarn over the hook 1 time before you insert the hook into the next stitch.Tip: You can begin working the double crochet cluster stitch at any point in a crochet project. You only need 1 stitch to work into, so a special number of stitches is not required. Insert the hook into the next stitch in your row. Next, locate the next stitch in your row and insert the hook into it. Keep the yarn over the hook as you do this. Yarn over the hook again and pull through the first 2 loops on the hook. Bring the yarn over the hook again and then pull it through the first 2 loops on your crochet hook. There should now be 2 loops on the hook. Loop the yarn over the hook again and draw through 1 loop. Bring the yarn over the hook again and pull it through 1 stitch only. This will leave you with 4 loops on the hook. Yarn over and draw through 2. Yarn over the hook again and pull the loop through 2 this time. Now, you should have 3 loops on the hook. Yarn over and pull through 1. Loop the yarn over the hook again and pull it through only 1 of the loops. This will leave you with 5 loops on the hook. Yarn over and draw through 2. Bring the yarn over the hook again and pull it through 2 loops. This will leave 4 loops on the hook. You can create clusters that are bigger by repeating the sequence additional times, or make smaller clusters by repeating the sequence fewer times. For example, after this yarn over and pull through 2, you could yarn over and pull through 1, then yarn over and pull through 2 one more time. Then, for the final stitch, you would need to yarn over and pull through 6. Loop the yarn over the hook 1 more time and pull through 4 loops. For the final time, yarn over the hook and pull it through the 4 loops on the hook. This will leave you with just 1 loop on your hook. Chain 1 to secure the cluster. After you have finished the stitch, make a chain of 1 to secure the stitch and provide slack for the next stitch. Loop the yarn over the hook 1 time and pull it through the loop on the hook. Repeat the entire sequence if you want to make more clusters. Trying a Double Crochet Cluster-V Stitch Begin with a chain that is a multiple of 4 plus 3. This will provide adequate space to work all of your double crochet cluster v-stitches. Chain a multiple of 4 and then add 3 to get the right amount. For example, you could start with a chain of 40 stitches and then add 3 for total of 43. Work 1 double crochet cluster stitch into a single stitch. Repeat the same process you used for the double crochet stitch to create a double crochet cluster stitch in the stitch space where you want the first double crochet cluster v-stitch to be. Chain 2 to provide slack for the next cluster. Work the 2 chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Yarn over 1 time and pull through, then repeat for the second chain. Work a second cluster stitch into the same stitch space. Repeat the process you used to create the first cluster stitch. After you finish this second cluster stitch, you have completed one full cluster-v stitch. Chain 2 and repeat the process to continue the stitch. If you plan to create more than 1 cluster-v stitch, you will need to work 2 chain stitches in between each cluster-v stitch. Tip: Note that separate cluster V-stitches must be worked into different stitches or gaps. In other words, every sub-stitch in 1 cluster V-stitch is worked into 1 space, but every individual cluster V-stitch is worked into a separate space.",

        "If you plan to create more than 1 cluster-v stitch, you will need to work 2 chain stitches in between each cluster-v stitch.",
        "Tip: Note that separate cluster V-stitches must be worked into different stitches or gaps.",
        "In other words, every sub-stitch in 1 cluster V-stitch is worked into 1 space, but every individual cluster V-stitch is worked into a separate space."
