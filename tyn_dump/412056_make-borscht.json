Grate the beets and carrots into approximately 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long pieces. Finally, shred the cabbage. Fry the onions with oil over medium heat.

Making Clear Borscht Fill a large pot with up to 12 cups (2.8 liters) of water. If your pot cannot hold that much, fill it up as much as you can. Keep in mind that your soup will be more concentrated and that you may have to scale back on some of the seasonings. Prepare the vegetables.
