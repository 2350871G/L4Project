Each bar (or count of \"1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4, 1...\") is assigned a chord, and together they form the melodic backbone of 95% of blues songs. To make it, you simply take the first (I), fourth (IV), and fifth (V) chords of the major scale and make them into chords. Once you know the form in one key, like \"E,\" you can then easily transpose the song into any key you want. For the key of E, your chords are E, A, and B. While the following article uses easy to form power chords, you can also uses seventh chords, minor chords, or minor sevenths. Before beginning, make sure you review the major and minor scales for guitar. The blues are in simple 4/4 time, like almost all radio songs.

        "Play the open string and second fret on the D string.",
        "Note how a box-like pattern is forming.",
        "The open strings form a constant \"line\" of notes in the scale, while your ring finger frets a box either 2-3 frets down.",
        "Here, you simply play the open string and the second fret.",
        "Play the open string, second fret, and third fret on the G string.",
        "This third fret is actually a reoccurring flat fifth -- it is the octave of the note you played earlier.",
        "Theory aside, this means the 3rd fret, usually played with your pinky, is another bluesy accent note.",
        "Play the open string and the 3rd fret of the last two strings.",
        "The last two strings are identical to the first string.",
        "Simply create this little box between the open string and the third frets on both the high-E and B strings.",
        "Move the whole scale down to the 12th fret to see how easily the form moves.",
        "You can play the exact same scale starting from a different E. Simply move the whole form down to the 12th fret, since the 6th string 12th fret note is another E. Now, instead of playing open notes, you simply fret every string on the 12th fret when you get to it.",
        "Everything else stays in place.",
        "Now that you know the scale, practice getting up and down it as smoothly and quickly as possible, in multiple locations across the fret board.",
