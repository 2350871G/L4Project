        "Mix the ingredients together until a thick, moist dough forms.",
        "Tapioca starch is also known as tapioca flour.",
        "If you prefer a more subtle garlic flavor, add 1 clove to the dough.",
        "If you prefer a stronger garlic flavor, add 2 or more.",
        "You can add other dried herbs, such as basil or rosemary, to the dough if you like.",
        "When you stir the dough, knead it with your spoon or spatula to remove any clumps.",
        "Shape the dough into balls and place them on the baking sheet.",
        "After you\u2019ve mixed the dough, scoop out heaping tablespoons (40 g) of it and roll them into balls with clean hands.",

        "When they\u2019ve cooled, serve the rolls alongside your favorite paleo meal.",
        "The rolls can dry out very quickly, so store any leftovers in an airtight container."
