Pull the cookie cutter out, and brush off any excess potato. You should now have raised shape in the center of your potato that is the same shape as your cookie cutter. This is your stamp. Cut your wrapping paper down to the size you need, then spread it out on your work surface. Choose some blank wrapping paper, such as white or brown craft paper, or butcher paper.

Using a Lint Roller and Craft Foam Get a lint roller and peel off the first sheet to reveal a fresh sticky sheet. You will be sticking your shapes to this to make a stamp. Don't worry, this stamp will not be permanent. If you want to change the design later on, you can simply peel off the current sheet, and add more foam pieces to it.

Keep your shapes smaller than 1 by 2\u00bd inches (2.54 by 6.35 centimeters). The simpler shapes you use, the better. The color of the craft foam does not matter.

Hand-stamped wrapping paper is perfect for any gift, but it works especially well for handmade gifts for that final, special touch. Carving a Custom Stamp Get a block of linoleum meant for carving stamps. You can often find them in the print-making section of an arts and crafts store. They are usually a light pink color and relatively thin. They are often labeled as \"carving blocks.\" Sketch out your design using a pen. Unless you have carved stamps before, it would be a good idea to keep the design simple. Fill in the areas you want to cut out. Leave the areas that you want to be \"colored\" blank. When you carve your stamp out, the raised areas will the parts that get stamped against your paper. Use a stamp carving tool to carve out the outline of your design. These stamps look a little bit like wood carving tools, except that they are much smaller, and the metal part is curved. They are often labeled as \"linoleum cutters.\" Use the stamp carving tool to carve out the areas you filled in. Carve the design out a little bit at a time using a scooping motion. You don't have to carve very deep or evenly; keep in mind that any raised areas will pick up ink and show up on your paper. Spread out your paper. Choose some brown or white craft  paper or butcher paper. Cut it down to the size you want, then spread it out on your work surface. Tape or weigh down the corners. Press your stamp against an ink pad. You can also use paint meant for print making, tempera paint, or acrylic paint. Press your stamp against the paper to create the design.
