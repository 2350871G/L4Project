    "text": " Identifying Wood Sorrel Check shaded areas. Wood sorrel enjoys growing close to the ground. It springs up in woodlands and on shaded slopes. One type of wood sorrel is also considered a weed that grows commonly on lawns in eastern North America. Look for white or yellow flowers. Sorrel is quickly recognizable by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers cluster near to the ground and have five petals apiece. White and yellow are its common colors, although there are pink and violet variants. Identify the heart-shaped leaves. When you are unsure, look at the leaves. Sorrel leaves grow in clusters of three. The leaves look heart-shaped with a fold down the center. The leaf veins branch off from the middle of the main vein, unlike in clover leaves, where many veins split off in parallel lines from each other. Cutting the Plant Pick the outer leaves. The outer leaves are mature. Leave behind the small leaves, which are near the stem. The leaves can simply be picked off by hand or cut using a knife.

Using and Storing Sorrel Rinse off the sorrel. Place what you\u2019ve picked under cold, running water. Remove any rotten parts as you go. Set the sorrel aside and allow it to dry. When used immediately, sorrel will taste best, but you can keep sorrel for several days in a sealed plastic bag. Bake leaves to dry them. Excess sorrel can be dried out and crumbled over food.
