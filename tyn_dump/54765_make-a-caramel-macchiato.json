Otherwise, the milk will be sweetened from the vanilla on the sides of your mug and from the caramel that you'll drizzle on the finished drink. You'll steam more milk than you'll end up using. This allows you to create foam and easily steam the milk. You can also use soy, almond, or hemp milk although they may steam differently than milk."
