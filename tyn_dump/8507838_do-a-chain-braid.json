    "text": " Making a Chain Braid Ponytail Pull your hair up into a ponytail. Secure it with a hair tie that matches your hair color. This style works best with high and mid-height ponytails, but you could try a low ponytail as well. Split the ponytail into two sections. Clip one of the sections out of the way for now. You will \"braid\" both of these sections separately. If you need to, use the end of a rattail comb to split your hair. Divide the remaining section into two equal-sized strands. Leave the other section alone for right now. Do not unclip it yet. Twist both of the strands to the right. Do not twist them together just yet. Use your fingers to twist each strand into a thin rope. Twist the strands together to form a thicker rope. This time, twist the strands to the left. This way, they will lock together, and won't come undone during the next step. Secure the braided rope with a clear elastic or mini hair tie. If you are braiding someone else's hair, you can have them hold the end of the rope for you. Repeat the above steps for the other section. Unclip the second section of hair. Divide it into two strands. Twist both strands to the right, then twist them together to the left. Tie the second rope off with a clear elastic or mini hair tie. Twist the two ropes together. Make sure that you twist them to the right. This will help lock them together, and prevent them from unraveling. As you twist them, you should notice a chain forming! Secure the end of the braid with a hair tie. If you'd like, you can add a hair accessory to the top or bottom of the braid. Give the braid a light mist of hairspray to keep it sleek and smooth. Making a Chain Braid Headband Part your hair down the center. If you'd like to, you can clip or tie the hair on one side of your head out of the way. You will be making two identical braids on each side of your head. Grab a small section of hair from next to the part. Try to leave a small gap between your front hair line and the section of hair. Divide the section into two thinner strands. The strands should be perpendicular to the center part. Tie the strands into a knot, just like tying a pair of shoes. Cross one strand over the other, then pull it through the formed loop. Gently pull on the strands to tighten the knot. Twist the strands slightly to catch any flyaways. You can also lightly mist them with water instead. Add some hair to each strand, just like French braiding. Take some hair from the left side of the knot, and add it to the left strand. Take some more hair from the right side of the knot, and add it to the right strand. The amount of hair you are adding should be thinner than the strands themselves. Tie the strands into another knot. Once again, give the strands a light twist to make them smooth, then tie them into a knot. Continue adding hair to each strand and tying them into knots. You can continue the braid to the back of your head, or you can stop just behind the ear. Try to keep the braid centered as you work. Tie the braid off with an elastic. When your braid is the length you desire, gather the two strands into a mini pigtail and secure them with a clear elastic or mini hair tie. Braid the other section of hair. Unclip the hair on the other side of your head. Gather a small section of hair from the hair line and split it into two strands. Chain-braid the two strands until you reach the back/side of your head. Secure the braid with an elastic when you are done. Gather your hair into a half-up, half-down ponytail or two pigtails. If you ended the braids on the back of your head, gather both mini ponytails, and secure them together with an elastic to make a thicker ponytail. If you ended the braids just behind your ear, gather all of your hair into two high pig tails. Secure them to the braids with hair ties. Twist the ponytail or pigtails into a bun.
