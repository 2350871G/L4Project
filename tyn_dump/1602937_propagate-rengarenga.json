Don't sow too deeply and only cover lightly. Wait anywhere between 10 to 30 days for germination. Keep watered. Plant the seedlings in small containers. They're ready for adding to the garden at around 10cm (4 inches) tall."

Use a garden fork to do this. Loosen the roots, then gently move the plant apart. When separating, hold the plant down as low as possible. Be sure to keep roots attached to each division. Plant into containers or into the garden for new growth."
