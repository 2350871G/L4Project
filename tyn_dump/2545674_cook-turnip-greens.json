Drain the leaves by drying them in a salad spinner, patting them dry with clean paper towels, or spreading them out on clean paper towels and allowing them to air dry. You could also clean the greens by allowing them to soak in a clean bowl or sink of cold water for several minutes to loosen the dirt. Quickly rinse with running water before draining."

You should have roughly 12 cups (3 liters) of torn turnip greens. If desired, you can also give the turnip greens a rough chop with a sharp knife instead of tearing them apart by hand."

The lemon juice helps to activate the myrosinase enzymes in the greens and increase the formation of isothiocyanates. In short, the lemon juice prevents the greens from wilting while increasing their nutritional benefits."
