Make sure that they provide a good amount of ankle support and get used to the fact that your ankle doesn't move when you're skating, because if there isn't ankle support than you may end up seriously screwing up your ankles if you land on them incorrectly."

When you reach it, jump onto the obstacle placing the h-block or center of your frame onto the corner slide across the surface keeping the center of your balance on your leading foot and jump off when you either feel yourself falling or whenever you reach the end of the object. If you don't slide across your obstacle there are two things you should do. If you have four wheels on each skate, try taking out the middle two. You actually don't need them to roll anyway, and they just get in the way when grinding. With most aggressive skates there are two very small wheels that don't even touch the ground, you don't have to take those out, they are for helping your grinds, and they don\u2019t get in your way. Apply wax to the surface you are grinding on. you can use candle wax for this, but there is special skating wax commonly used for just this purpose."
