Grab the plant as close to the surface of the soil as you can, being careful not to damage its foliage, and gently pull it up out of the soil.If you aren\u2019t sure where to dig around the roots, start at least 3 in (7.6 cm) away from the base of the stem for small plants and at least 6 in (15 cm) away from the base of the stem for larger plants.
