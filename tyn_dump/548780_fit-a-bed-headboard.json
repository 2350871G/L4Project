                    "description": "Divan beds are designed as backless, but they often include screw holes for headboards to be added later. Before purchasing a new headboard, check how far apart its struts need to be in order to fit your bed. Check the back of your bed for bolts or screw holes on either side and measure the distance between them. Larger beds may have more than one hole in a vertical line, but measuring these aren't necessary. You want the horizontal distance from a hole toward one side of the bed to one that's level with it toward the other. This step is not necessary if you plan to mount your headboard to the wall."

Next, decide if you want the headboard to back any surrounding furniture, such as matching nightstands. If so, measure the distance between the bed and those pieces' farthest sides. Add those figures to your total width. Headboards typically project anywhere up to three inches (7.6 cm) past the corner of the bed's head. If you are backing other furniture as well, apply this rule to their farthest sides from the bed."

First, decide exactly how high the headboard should be from the floor. Next, measure the height of the headboard itself to determine where the headboard cleat needs to be installed. Then mark the following measurements in pencil on the wall:\nThe height of the headboard's bottom from the floor. The height of its top from the floor. A fourth of the way down from its top (for the cleat). Find and mark studs. Use a stud-finder to locate studs behind the wall in the area where the headboard will be mounted. For a single cleat, find two consecutive studs that are closest to the center of your bed. Mark each one's location with pencil on the wall at the height of your third measurement (a fourth of the way down from the top of headboard). Always mount your cleat to studs, even if it isn't perfectly centered over your bed. A slightly off-center cleat mounted to studs will be stronger than a perfectly centered cleat attached to drywall.
