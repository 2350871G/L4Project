To preserve it for longer, move it to a storage spot such as a closet or cellar. Keep it on a shelf, if possible, to avoid cold floors or moisture that can lead to rotting. Squash will develop soft spots or dark marks when it starts going bad. Watch out for broken stems or blemishes.

        "You can also try freezing spirals or pureed butternut squash, but keep in mind that they may freeze faster and spoil faster than cubes due to their size.",
        "To cut spirals, divide and clean the squash as you normally would, then use a spiralizer to shred the pieces into noodles.",
        "Spread the squash in a single layer on a baking tray.",
        "Choose a baking tray you don\u2019t mind sticking in the freezer for a little while.",
        "You will need to solidify the squash chunks before storing them long-term.",
        "Make sure they aren\u2019t stacked on top of one another so all of the sides freeze evenly.",
        "To prevent the squash from sticking to the tray, you can place a piece of parchment paper on the tray before adding the squash.",
        "For squash spirals, freeze them on the tray as you normally would.",
        "For pureed squash, you can freeze it directly in a container or ice tray.",
        "Freeze the squash pieces for 1 hour until they are frozen through.",
        "Place the baking tray directly in the freezer, then set your timer.",
        "After the time is up, test the squash by touching it.",
        "Make sure the chunks feel solid on all sides.",
        "Freezing the chunks this way takes water out of them, ensuring they last longer in storage.",
        "Improperly frozen butternut squash can soften over time.",
        "It also prevents them from sticking together, so thawing portions is easier.",
        "Transfer the squash chunks to a freezer bag or container.",
        "Make sure your storage method is resealable and freezer-safe.",
        "Leave about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) at the top of each bag or container in case the squash expands.",
        "If the squash chunks stick to the baking tray, leave the tray out at room temperature.",
        "Wait a minute for the squash to come unstuck.",
        "Label the container with the current date.",
        "This will help you remember when you put the squash in the freezer.",
        "You can write directly on most storage bags with permanent marker.",
        "If you\u2019re using a container, try writing the date on a sticker and placing it on the container.",
        "If you freeze lots of squash, clear labels will also help you keep track of what to use first.",
        "The longer the squash has been in storage, the quicker it needs to be used.",
        "Store the squash in the freezer for up to 8 months.",
        "The squash chunks will last a while in the freezer, so you can take them out whenever you need them.",
        "After 8 months, butternut squash may soften, take on freezer burn, or lose flavor, so try to use it before this happens.",
        "Cooked squash can also be stored the same way.",
        "Put it directly in a sealed container and into the freezer.",
        "It will last a similar length of time as raw squash.",
        "Curing Fresh Squash Cure the squash in sunlight for up to 10 days.",
        "Curing removes water from butternut squash, hardening it so it lasts in storage.",
        "Cut the squash off the vine, preserving the stem.",
        "Then, lay the squash on a wire mesh in a sunny area.",
        "After about 7 days, test the squash with your fingernail.",
        "If you can\u2019t dent it with your fingernail, it is ready for storage.",
        "The ideal storage environment is between 80 and 85 \u00b0F (27 and 29 \u00b0C) with a relative humidity between 80% and 85%.",
        "If you don\u2019t have space outdoors, you can position the squash by a heater and set up a fan for circulation.",
        "Keep the stem at least 2 in (5.1 cm) long.",
        "A butternut squash with a broken stem or blemishes will not last long in storage, so use it first.",
        "Wash squash with diluted bleach to clean it.",
        "Combine about 1 part bleach with 10 parts water, then turn the squash in the mixture.",
        "This will clear off a lot of bacteria and fungi spores that can ruin the squash.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, rinse the squash off under clean water and dry it off completely with a soft cloth.",
        "A vinegar solution may also be used in place of the bleach solution.",
        "Mix about 1 part vinegar to 4 parts water, then wash the squash as you normally would.",
        "Washing the squash improves the chance of it lasting a long time in storage.",
        "You can try storing your squash without cleaning it, but be aware that it may start to go bad faster than usual.",
        "Find a cool, dry storage spot between 50 and 55 \u00b0F (10 and 13 \u00b0C).",
        "This is the ideal temperature range for preserving butternut squash.",
        "Some good storage places include a closet or a basement.",
        "For the best results, keep the relative humidity between 50% and 70%.",
        "Temperatures below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) will cause butternut squash to freeze and rot.",
        "They can be stored safely in warmer temperatures but may spoil faster than usual.",
        "Store the squash on a shelf away from moisture.",
        "Moisture causes the squash to soften and rot prematurely, so be aware of any leaks in your home.",
        "Keep the squash off the cold ground to avoid damage.",
        "For proper storage, arrange the squash in a single layer on the shelf with space between each one.",
        "To protect the squash from moisture, you can wrap them individually in newspaper and even store them in a cardboard box.",
        "This makes blemishes a little more difficult to spot without searching, though.",
        "Store cured butternut squash for up to 3 months on a shelf.",
        "When properly cured, butternut squash can last much longer than it would when cut up and put in the refrigerator.",
        "The important part to remember is that the storage time can vary from squash to squash.",
        "Your squash may start to soften or rot as soon as 2 months in storage.",
        "Damaged squash won\u2019t last the full 3 months.",
        "Look out for any with a broken stem or damaged skin.",
        "Any squash exposed to freezing temperatures won\u2019t last the full 3 months, either.",
        "Use them as soon as possible.",
        "Inspect the stored squash every week for damage.",
        "Your squash may take on fungi, bacteria, or water damage over time.",
        "These spots show up as brown or green blemishes.",
        "Healthy butternut squash has light orange skin.",
        "When you spot a blemished squash, move the squash away from the others.",
        "Squash with water marks are usually safe to eat, but make use of them right away.",
        "Soft, green spots are due to mold and should be avoided.",
        "If you notice your squash softening, it is about to spoil.",
        "Use it as soon as possible to avoid having to throw it away."
