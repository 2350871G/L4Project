Some sources have a corporate author (the individual writer is not specified)\u2014in these instances, simply use the name of the corporation as the author\u2019s name. In cases in which the corporation has a long or complicated name, use its abbreviation to make for more fluid reading. Cite the article\u2019s title if the source does not have a given author. Follow this with the page number the passage was taken from. This is common for smaller website pages, which often do not list an individual author. (For long titles, instead of using the title in its entirety, use a condensed version.) If the source is a short work\u2014like a journal article, book chapter, or poem\u2014put the title in quotations when citing.

If your source contains more than three authors, you have two options for proper referencing. You may use just the first author\u2019s last name, followed by \u201cet al.\u201d (This is a common Latin phrase which means \u201cand others\u201d), or you may use all of the authors\u2019 last names in your citation. In cited works with a longer list of authors, consider using the \u201cet al.\u201d option.

Parenthetical citation using all last names: Legal experts counter Smith, Jones, and White's argument by noting that the current evidence suggests otherwise (Marks et al. 4). Cite multiple works with the same author. When referencing several sources with the same author, cite the work using a condensed version of the title followed by the page number. When citing articles and other shorter works, use quotation marks. When citing books and other longer works, italicize the title. Cite multivolume works. Some sources have multiple volumes. When referencing different volumes of one particular source, be sure to include the volume number along with a page number and separate the two with a colon. When citing just one volume within a multivolume source, just the page number should be provided in parentheses. Example of citation: \u201c\u2026as Smith wrote in Experimental Thesis (1: 30-31).\u201d Cite the Bible. There are many common translations of the Bible, including the King James Version, English Standard Version, and New International Version. As such, you want to distinctly identity which Bible translation you are referencing and then be sure to name the book, chapter, and verse within your citation. When stating the version of the Bible, italicize or underline the title. When stating the specific book from the Bible you are referencing, do not italicize or underline its title. Example of citation: Ezekiel saw \u201cwhat seemed to be four living creatures,\u201d each with faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle (King James Holy Bible, Ezek. 1.5-10). Use \u201cqtd\u201d when citing indirect sources. Indirect sources are secondary sources that are already referenced within a source. When citing this type of source write \u201cqtd.\u201d before the name of the source, followed by the page number. For example: \u201c\u2026 (qtd. in Smith 230)\u2026\u201d Cite internet sources. For sources found electronically, page and paragraph numbers may not exist; you do not need to include them within your citation. Simply cite the name of the article, film, or website when citing an internet source. Using APA Style Internal Citations Use both authors\u2019 last names when citing a work with two authors. When referencing a source with two authors, be sure to use both last names within one single phrase. When citing within the text, the names are joined with the word \u201cand,\u201d followed by the date of publication in parentheses. For parenthetical citation, use an ampersand, followed by a comma and the year of publication, all within parentheses. As in MLA, the parenthetical citation should appear after the sentence has ended, but prior to the period. For example, \u201c(Smith & Jones, 2001).\u201d\nName both authors every time you cite this source.

Sometimes a source has no author or the author cannot be found. When this is the case, use the source\u2019s title; if the title is lengthy, you can shorten it and include only the first word or two within the parentheses. Cite sources with unknown author. As with MLA style, use the article\u2019s title (or a shortened version of the title) in place of an author\u2019s name: \u201cThe experiment yielded multiple results (\u201cLearning Theory,\u201d 2006).\u201d\nTitles of web pages, articles, and chapters are cited using quotation marks. Titles of reports and books are italicized. Cite organizations as an author. As in MLA style, if your source is a government agency or an organization, use the entire name during your initial citation. If the name has an abbreviation, indicate it within brackets the first time citing this source. For subsequent citations, only use the abbreviation. First citation: (Public Action to Deliver Shelter [P.A.D.S. ], 2006)\nSecond citation: (P.A.D.S., 2006) Use a semicolon to separate two or more sources that are cited within the same parentheses. There are times when you may need to reference two or more sources within one parenthetical in-text citation. When doing this, separate the two sources using a semicolon, then the sources in alphabetical order by author\u2019s last name. Your citation would look like this, (Smith, 2006; Jones, 2008). Include authors\u2019 first initials to avoid confusion between two cited authors with the same last name. At times you may run into two authors with the same name. When this occurs, simply avoid any uncertainties by using first initials along with the last names of both cited authors. Your citation would like this, (A. Smith, 2005; B. Jones, 2008). Cite two or more sources with the same author and year. When using two or more sources published in the same year and authored by the same person, simply use lower case letters, alphabetically, after the year of publication to distinguish them. For example:\n\u201cDiscovered by Smith (2006a) during his experimental testing\u2026.\u201d Cite introductions, prefaces, forewords, and afterwords. Treat in-text citations for introductions, prefaces, forewords, and afterwords like you would a simple author-date citation. Your citation would look like this, (Smith & Jones, 2005). Include name and date when you cite personal information. Personal communication includes information gathered from interviews, e-mails, letters, and any other type of person-to-person communication. To reference any of these sources, include the communicator\u2019s name, the date of communication, and identify this source as \u201cpersonal communication.\u201d\nIn-text citation: Smith stated that he conducted the experiment with the help of colleagues (personal communication, December 2, 2005). Parenthetical citation: \u201c(Smith, personal communication, December 2, 2005).\u201d Use \u201cqtd\u201d to indicate an indirect source in a citation. Indirect sources are also called \u201csecondary sources\u201d; these are sources that are already cited by another source. The information from an indirect source is not the original source from which the information was initially collected. To cite this kind of source, use the original source in your single phrase and use the secondary source in parenthesis. Your citation would look like this: Smith proved within his experiment that\u2026. (as cited in Jones, 2006, p. 30). Cite electronic sources like any other kind of source, using the author-date approach to referencing. Your citation should look like this, Smith (2006) stated\u2026 \nIf you come across an electronic source with no author or date provided, use the entire title or the first word or two of the title, plus \u201cn.d.\u201d to denote \u201cno date\u201d. For electronic sources without page numbers, try to incorporate as much information as possible that would help the reader find the text being referenced.",
