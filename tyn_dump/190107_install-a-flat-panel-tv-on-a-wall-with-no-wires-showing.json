Find a mount at an electronics store or online and check the maximum weight and size that it can hold. Opt for a full-motion mount so you can tilt and swivel your TV if you need to make adjustments. Try searching online for your TV\u2019s model number followed by \u201cmount\u201d if you want to ensure the mount works with your television. You can usually find the model number on a sticker on the back of the TV or printed on the box. If your TV is lighter than 80 pounds (36 kg), you can use a mount that attaches vertically. If your TV weighs more, you\u2019ll need a mount that secures horizontally so it evenly distributes the weight."

An in-home power extender has 2 receptacles that connect behind your wall and provide power to an additional outlet. When you plug the lower receptacle into a wall outlet, it will provide power to the upper receptacle that you can hide behind the TV. Look at an electronics store or online for a power bridge that has built-in power connectors so it\u2019s easier to wire. You can buy in-wall power extenders from electronics stores or online for between $40\u2013100 USD. Trace the outlines of the power extender receptacles on your wall.

Place the lower receptacle straight down from the first one so it\u2019s at least 6 inches (15 cm) off of the ground, and draw the outline on your wall. The lower receptacle will be visible on your wall, but you can easily hide it behind a shelf or entertainment center. Make sure both receptacles are between the same studs if your wall has them so it\u2019s easier to fish the wires. Cut along your outlines using a drywall saw or utility knife. Push the blade of the saw or knife into your wall so it breaks through the other side. Use a slow and straight sawing motion to slice through the drywall along the outline you drew. Pop the piece of drywall away from the wall after cutting it out. Repeat the process with the other outline that you marked. You can buy a drywall saw from your local hardware store. If you have brick or concrete walls, hire a contractor to cut through it for you so you don\u2019t cause any additional damage.

Plug the power connectors from the receptacles into each other. Locate the power connector on the back of the upper receptacle and line it up with the connector you fished through the wall. Push the connectors together to secure them so electricity can run between the 2 receptacles. Feed the power connectors back into your wall once you plug them in. You do not need to turn off power at the circuit when you install an in-wall power extender since you aren\u2019t connecting it to any existing wires. Push the AV cords through the holes in the receptacles. Look for the holes in the receptacles that have rubber or plastic guards surrounding them.

Repeat the process with the other receptacle so the wires extend about 3 feet (91 cm) out from each side. Be sure to put the cords through the receptacles before you screw the receptacles in, or else you won\u2019t be able to pull them through easily. Screw the receptacles into your drywall with a screwdriver. Push the receptacles into the holes so they\u2019re flush with your wall. Place the screws into the holes along the outer lips of the receptacles and screw them directly into your drywall. Be careful not to overtighten them or you could damage your walls or the receptacle. You do not need to pre-drill holes before screwing in the receptacles. Connecting Your Hardware Screw the vertical brackets from the mount onto the back of your TV. Position the brackets on the back of your TV so they line up with the 4 screw holes near the corners. Feed the screws provided with the mount through the holes in the bracket and tighten them by hand. Finish screwing them in with a screwdriver so the bracket is tight against the back of your television. Some mounts may have X-shaped brackets. Don\u2019t overtighten the screws, or you could damage your TV. Secure the brackets to the mount on the wall. Look for the clips or hooks on the bracket that attach to the mount on your wall.

If it isn\u2019t, try grabbing the sides of your TV and rotating it to make the adjustment. If the TV doesn\u2019t move at all, loosen the screws on the bracket or mount before moving the TV again. Plug the TV\u2019s power cord into the upper power extender receptacle. Wrap the power cord for the TV around the mount if you\u2019re able to so it doesn\u2019t hang down. Push the plug into the outlet on the upper receptacle just like you would use a standard outlet. Your TV won\u2019t have power until you plug the lower receptacle into another wall outlet. Use the extension cable to plug the lower receptacle into an existing outlet. The extension cable from the power extender kit has a male end with prongs and a female end with an outlet. Plug the female end of the cord into the prongs on the lower receptacle, and attach the male end to a nearby wall outlet to power it. The electricity from the existing wall outlet will travel through the connectors inside the wall and provide power to the upper receptacle.Tip: Plug the male end of the extension cord into a surge protector if you want to keep your TV and electronics safe from power surges. Attach the AV cables to the back of your TV and your devices. Take the AV cords from the upper receptacle and wrap them around the mount so they don\u2019t hang below the TV. Push the cords into the matching ports on the back or sides of the TV so they have a firm connection.
