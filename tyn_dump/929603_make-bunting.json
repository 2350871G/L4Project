This is less important if you are using small pieces of fabric, like tea towels. Make sure that the edges of the fabric are straight when using them as a guide for the template; otherwise, you will end up with wobbly looking flags. For uneven edges, pin the template away from the edge or trim the edges to straighten them. If you have a large piece of fabric, fold the fabric in half before pinning the template to it. This will allow you to save time by cutting 2 flags at once. The amount of the fabric you use can vary greatly depending on how large your template is and how many flags you want to make. Ideally, make your template first and decide approximately how many triangles you want to make before purchasing the fabric. Those measurements will help you determine how much fabric you will need. Choose a simple fabric like a cotton-polyester blend for making the bunting. Silks or other fancy blends may be difficult to sew. Using fabrics that have a print or color on both sides instead of just one side will also save you a lot of time while sewing."

To do this, layer and pin 2 triangles together so that the pattern is facing inwards. Use a straight stitch to sew 2 of the triangle sides together. If you are not using an equilateral triangle, this would be the 2 longer sides. Accomplish this by using a sewing machine or a needle and a thread. Leave approximately a \u20445 in (0.51 cm) seam around the flag. Remove the pins and then push the point of the flag through the unstitched side so that the pattern is right-side out.

Once you place the last flag, leave another 16 in (41 cm) of excess tape on the end before you cut it. If you can't decide on a measurement, aim to have at least 5 in (13 cm) of space between each flag. It is easier to arrange and adjust the spacing of the flags on the tape before you cut it.

        "If you decide to use a rotary cutter, place a board underneath the fabric so you do not damage the surface you are working on.",
        "Repeat the process until you have a desired number of flags.",
        "The flags can be close together or spread out, so the number of flags you need to make greatly depends on the look you want to achieve.",
        "Start by making 6 to 10 flags.",
        "After you arrange them, you can always cut out more.",
        "Cut double the amount of triangles for fabrics with single-sided designs.",
        "Not all fabrics have a given pattern or color on both sides.",
        "To keep the bunting uniform, you will need to stitch together 2 triangles to create a single flag.",
        "This way, the pattern or color will visible on both sides.",
        "So if you wanted 6 flags, you will need to cut 12 triangles, and stitch them together in pairs.",
        "To do this, layer and pin 2 triangles together so that the pattern is facing inwards.",
        "Use a straight stitch to sew 2 of the triangle sides together.",
        "If you are not using an equilateral triangle, this would be the 2 longer sides.",
        "Accomplish this by using a sewing machine or a needle and a thread.",
        "Leave approximately a \u20445 in (0.51 cm) seam around the flag.",
        "Remove the pins and then push the point of the flag through the unstitched side so that the pattern is right-side out.",
        "Press the flag down until it is smooth.",
        "Don't worry about stitching the final side to the triangle, as it will be covered with bias binding tape.",
        "Repeat this process until all of your flags are completed.",
        "Arrange the flags along the bias binding tape so they are evenly spaced.",
        "Place the first flag at least 16 in (41 cm) in from the end of the tape\u2014this will be one of the ends used to hang the bunting.",
        "Then have fun playing with the spacing of the flags.",
        "The flags can be close together so the points are touching, or drastically spread apart.",
        "Once you place the last flag, leave another 16 in (41 cm) of excess tape on the end before you cut it.",
        "If you can't decide on a measurement, aim to have at least 5 in (13 cm) of space between each flag.",
        "It is easier to arrange and adjust the spacing of the flags on the tape before you cut it.",
        "This way, you have the option to increase or decrease the spacing without worrying about the length of the tape.",
        "If you had to stitch your flags, place the unsewn end of the flag along the tape.",
        "This will later hide and seal the open end of the flag.",
        "Fold the binding tape over each flag and secure it down with pins.",
        "Crease the fold with your fingernail or the edge of a ruler as you place the pins.",
        "This will create a crisp line and work out any visible bumps between the layers of fabric.",
        "Use a straight stitch to sew the binding tape to the flags.",
        "Stitch this by hand, or run it through a sewing machine.",
        "Remove the pins as you stitch the binding tape over each of flags.",
        "This way the pins don't fall out as you handle the rest of the bunting.",
        "Hang the bunting as is or add additional decorations to each triangle.",
        "For a minimalistic or everyday look, hang the bunting as is.",
        "The colors and subtle patterns will make a nice decoration for any room.",
        "If the bunting is for a celebration, add shapes or letters to each of the triangles.",
        "Consider spelling out someone's name on the bunting, or display a simple message like, \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d or \u201cWelcome Home!\u201d Using Paper Triangles Fold a piece of paper in half to create a crease that will support the string.",
        "Any color or detailing on the paper should be visible on the outside.",
        "Press in the crease with your fingernail or the edge of a ruler.",
        "When folded, the piece of paper should still be able to support the size of the template you made.",
        "To do this, choose a piece of paper that's at least double the size of your flag template.",
        "To save yourself some time, make the size of your flag fit an existing paper size.",
        "For example, a standard piece of scrapbook paper that is 12 by 12 in (30 by 30 cm) will make 2 equilateral triangles that are 6 in (15 cm) around.",
        "Making your template for a 6 in (15 cm) triangle will eliminate a lot of tedious measuring later on.",
        "If you want to reuse your paper bunting for different events, use a thick paper like cardstock or scrapbook paper.",
        "Thicker paper won't crease or tear as easily as printer or construction paper.",
        "Place your template against the folded edge of the paper and trace it.",
        "Make light pencil marks that can be easily erased.",
        "If you are worried that the pencil will not erase well, refold the paper so that the design is facing inward before tracing the template.",
        "Depending on the size of the paper and the size of your template, you may garner 2 flags from each page.",
        "Repeat this process until you have traced a desired amount of flags.",
        "Cut out the traced triangles but make sure not to cut the folded edge.",
        "Use scissors or a paper cutter to do this.",
        "If you use scissors, be careful to not deviate from the stenciled line, as divots and curved lines will be visible on your bunting when you display it.",
        "Slip the flags over the string and leave some space between each flag.",
        "Hang the folded crease over the string so the pattern or color is visible on both sides.",
        "Have fun playing with the spacing between the flags.",
        "Spread the flags far apart from each other, or place them close together.",
        "Once you decide on a distance, use a ruler to make the spaces even.",
        "In order to hang your bunting, leave about 16 in (41 cm) of excess string on each end before cutting it.",
        "Place 2 glue dots inside each flag to secure them to the string.",
        "Put 1 glue dot in the center of the crease and 1 at the point of the triangle.",
        "Stick the glue dot along the crease so that it overlaps the string.",
        "Then carefully press the triangle closed to secure it.",
        "The glue dot on the string will keep the triangle from falling off or sliding.",
        "Instead of glue dots, you can also double-stick tape.",
        "Repeat this process until all of your flags are secured and sealed.",
        "Decorate the flags with letters and shapes to further personalize it.",
        "Consider adding someone's name or a personalized message onto the bunting.",
        "This is a great detail to add if you are using your bunting for a holiday or celebration.",
        "If you want a minimalistic look or if you chose a paper with a fun pattern and don't want to cover it up, hang the bunting as is."
