If your head is between 21 to 22 inches (51 to 55 cm), then you should be able to fit into most cosplay wigs. If your head is any larger, it's a good idea to try on the wig to make sure it fits comfortably. Choose a wig cap. There are usually two types of wig caps. One kind of wig cap is made of a fishnet-like material. The other type is similar to pantyhose. The fishnet wig cap is often tighter and hair can come out of the holes. The pantyhose wig cap is usually preferred because it's not as tight and covers all of your hair. Arrange your hair for the wig cap.

Make sure the top of the clip is over the cap and the bottom of the wig is under the hair and cap. Putting on the Wig Slide the wig over your head. Hold the wig with both hands. The backs of your hands should be facing each other, and the fingers should be inside the wig with thumbs outside of the wig. Slowly begin to slide the wig over the cap. Place the wig's scalp line against your forehead. It should be placed just above your eyebrows.
