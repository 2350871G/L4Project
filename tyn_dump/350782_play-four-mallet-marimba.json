In fact, a good way to practice this movement is by turning a doorknob a couple of times and paying particular attention to the rotation that occurs. You want to duplicate this rotation. Your wrist should twist slightly away from you, bringing the top of the mallet downward. With practice, this movement will become minimal \u2013 you won\u2019t have to move your wrist very much at all to make the mallet move downward. As you play you'll teach yourself how to roll just imagine a doorknob you can't open and your twisting and turning it."
