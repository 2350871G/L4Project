In warmer climates this could be in mid-spring, and in cooler climates you might have to wait until late spring. If you plant your squash too early, it won't survive. If you want to get a head start, you can start the seeds indoors up to 3 weeks before the last frost. Plant the seeds 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep in seed starter mix in small pots. Keep them moist and warm until the last frost has passed, after which you can transplant them to the garden."
