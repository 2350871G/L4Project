        "If the wires are too short or too stiff to bend with your fingers, use a pair of needle-nose pliers to bend the wires.",
        "Attach the second long wire to the positive rail.",
        "Wrap 1 end of your short 2 in (5.1 cm) segment of wire 2-3 times around the end of the second long wire (that\u2019s not connected to the transistor).",
        "Do this on the end farthest away from the transistor.",
        "Then, bend the short wire, and insert its other end through a hole in the positive (red) rail on a long edge of the breadbox.",
        "This will allow power from the battery to get to the LED, once you\u2019ve connected the battery.",
        "Hook the battery up to your circuit.",
        "Connect the 9-volt battery connector to the positive and negative outlet ports on the battery itself.",
        "Hook the negative (blue) wire around the negative power rail at the end of the breadboard farthest from the transistor.",
        "Connect the positive (red) wire coming from the 9-volt battery to the positive power rail.",
        "The 9-volt adapter comprises a rubber head with 2 receivers to snap on the + and \u2013 ports of the battery.",
        "Notice that 2 wires emerge from the head: 1 positive (red) and 1 negative (blue).",
        "Touch the 2 long wires to activate the circuit.",
        "These wires are referred to as the \u201ctouch wires.\u201d Use 1 finger and press down on the 2 touch wires.",
        "Make sure that you\u2019re touching both at once.",
        "Press them down against the breadboard, and watch as the LED lights up.",
        "Try experimenting with different types of touch: light, heavy, etc.",
        "Depending on how much pressure you put on the wires, you\u2019ll notice that the LED illuminates more or less brightly."
