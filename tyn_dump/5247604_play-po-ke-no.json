It is possible to play the game without these containers but it is not recommended. This is because as the game progresses players will begin to add money to each pile respectively and it may be difficult to distinguish one pot from the next. There are several different labels that can be placed on each pot, but there are usually four standard pot labels that are typically used by players universally. The labels for the pots are Corners, Centers, Five in a Row, & Four of a Kind. Centers is for when a player covers the center space on their game board. Corners is for when a player covers the four corners of their game board. Five in a Row is when a player covers five in a row across their game board. This can either be diagonally, horizontally, or vertically. Four of a kind is for when a player has four of the same denomination, such as 4 Jacks."
