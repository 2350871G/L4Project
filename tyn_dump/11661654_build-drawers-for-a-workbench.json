Each board should have the same dimensions, unless the bench is crooked or wasn't built straight. If the plywood boards are too small for the workbench, you can use multiple boards in a row or, if you\u2019re not installing that many drawers, just leave the boards short.

        "Write these measurements down and use them to make your drawers.Take special care to measure exactly if you\u2019re making drawers that aren\u2019t the same size.",
        "Confirm how much space you have for each one.",
        "Even if you made the spacers equal-distance apart, still measure each side to confirm.",
        "Otherwise, your drawers might not be the right size.",
        "Mark the plywood for the base, front, back, and sides of the drawers.",
        "For the drawer sides, measure the length of the workbench and how deep you want the drawers to be.",
        "For the front and back, measure the width between the spacers and the depth of the drawers.",
        "For the base, measure the length of the bench and width between the spacers.",
        "Mark all of these measurements on the wood in pencil.The amount of wood you use depends on how many drawers you\u2019re making.",
        "The depth of the drawers depends on how much storage space you want.",
        "For papers or light items, 3 inches (7.6 cm) would work.",
        "To store tools or larger items, make them at least 6 inches (15 cm).",
        "Cut the plywood for the drawer base and sides.",
        "Use a table saw, circular saw, or miter saw to make the cuts.",
        "Cut along each line you drew.",
        "Make sure you keep the saw straight so the cuts are exact.Wear gloves and goggles while operating the saw.",
        "Screw the drawer sides together to make a rectangle.",
        "Arrange the side, front, and back pieces of each drawer to make a rectangle.",
        "Drill 2 screws into each corner to secure the pieces together.",
        "Repeat this process for all the drawers.If you prefer, you can drill pocket holes into each piece.",
        "This hides the screws better, but it isn\u2019t a necessary step.",
        "If you won\u2019t be storing heavy items in these drawers, then you could just use wood glue to fasten them together.",
        "Squeeze a layer of wood glue along the bottom border of the drawer.",
        "Work along the border and squeeze out a line of glue.",
        "Use the same amount on each drawer you\u2019re building.This is a quicker method of attaching the base.",
        "If you prefer, you can use screws on the base as well, instead of glue.",
        "Press the base piece onto the glue.",
        "Line up the base board with the sides of the drawer.",
        "Then press the board down and apply pressure to make the glue stick.",
        "Run your hand around the border to ensure the board is attached at all points.For extra security, you can add nails or screws along the bottom to hold the base in place.",
        "If the panel is thin enough, you can also use staples.",
        "Install handles on the front of each drawer.",
        "Measure the distance between the screw holes in the handles you\u2019re using and mark those points on the front of each drawer.",
        "Drill a hole into each point.",
        "Then, hold the handle over the holes and install the screws from the back.",
        "Repeat this for each drawer.You can buy handle kits from hardware stores.",
        "Attaching the Drawers Attach the sliders to the bottom of each drawer.",
        "This hardware allows the drawers to slide in and out of the bench.",
        "Place a slider on each side of the drawers.",
        "Line them up with the bottom edge of the drawer, running from front to back, and make sure they\u2019re straight.",
        "Then screw each one into place.Different slider kits may come with different instructions.",
        "Follow the directions on the product you use.",
        "Slider kits are available at hardware stores.",
        "Match the sizes to the size of the drawers you\u2019re making.",
        "Get as many as you need for the number of drawers you\u2019re making.",
        "Measure the distance from the top of the drawer to the sliders.",
        "Use your tape measure and check the distance from the top of each drawer to the slider.",
        "If you made each drawer the same size, then this should be the same measurement on each one, but double check just to make sure.",
        "Write this measurement down so you remember it for the next step.If you made the drawers different sizes, then be sure to check the distance for each one.",
        "Mark the distance for the slider mounts on each spacer.",
        "Take the distance you measured from the top of each drawer to the slider.",
        "Then, measure that distance down from the top of the workbench.",
        "Use a straightedge and make a line at this point to indicate where the slider mount should go.",
        "Repeat the process on all the spacers.If you\u2019re installing multiple drawers down in a column, then measure the length from each slider to the next.",
        "Attach the sliders to the sides of each spacer.",
        "Take the mounting sliders that correspond with the sliders on the drawers.",
        "Hold each one up to the line you drew and make sure it\u2019s straight.",
        "Then screw the slider into place.",
        "Do the same for the corresponding slider on the other side.",
        "Repeat this for each drawer.Different spacer kits may have different installation instructions.",
        "Follow the directions provided.",
        "Slide the drawers into place.",
        "Take each drawer and line up its sliders with the slider mounts in the bench.",
        "Tilt the front of the drawer down to insert it into the mount, the angle it up and slide it into position.",
        "When you\u2019ve installed each drawer, then the upgrade is complete."
