If you have a round face, a sharp, high angle will open your eyes and elongate and balance the face. You can get away with most shapes if you have an oval face. If your face is very long, try extending the length of your brows and don't fill them too much or too dark. A heart-shaped face can be a challenge--too shaped or angled can be harsh and accentuate your forehead. Try a lower, straighter arch that follows your brow bone.

Focus more on grooming than on shaping and plucking. If your eyes are close together, leave the hair closest to your nose alone. Instead of making your eyes look wider, it will highlight their closeness. Extend your brows with a long, wide arch and don't go too thin or sharp."

        "Dab a little more powder over your drawn-on eyebrows and finish with a makeup or brow sealing solution.",
        "The powder and sealer will ensure your brows don't smudge or get rubbed or sweated off during the day.",
