Saturate a cotton ball with the rubbing alcohol, then gently squeeze it to remove any excess. If you don\u2019t have a cotton ball, use a cotton pad, paper towel, or washcloth instead. Avoid using tissue, as it\u2019s less sturdy and may fall apart while you\u2019re cleaning."

As you\u2019re cleaning the curler, keep rotating the cotton ball so you\u2019re always using a clean surface. If you need to, switch to a second cotton ball. Press the cotton ball down into the hinges and joints in the curler to make sure you don\u2019t miss any spots where bacteria could be hiding.
