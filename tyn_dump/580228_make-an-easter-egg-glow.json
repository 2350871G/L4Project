If you are worried about paint sealing the eggs closed, open the eggs before laying them on the newspaper open-end down. Open up the eggs and add any candy or prize you like.

Under a Black Light Paint plastic or hard-boiled eggs with paint that glows under a black light. Using neon-colored eggs may mean you won't have to paint them, but neon black light paint will always glow brighter.
