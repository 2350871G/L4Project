A static-free, fiber-free cloth works best, but most non-abrasive cloths will also work well. Do not, however, use paper towels, dish towels, or other rough cloths. Do not drench the cloth in water. A soaked cloth is more likely to drip excess water into the machine, which could cause serious damage to your computer. If you accidentally use too much water, wring the cloth out well until it is only slightly moist. For best results, use distilled water instead of tap water. Tap water contains minerals, and some of these minerals can be conductive. As a result, tap water is more likely to cause a short than distilled water. Do not, under any circumstance, spray water directly onto the screen of the Macbook Pro. This significantly increases your odds of getting water into the machine, thereby making a short more likely. Only use water if you apply it with a soft cloth."
