        "Wrap the rectangle around the top of the braid to conceal the stitching.",
        "Place the narrow end of the rectangle against the top of your braid.",
        "Wrap it around the top of the braid a few times, making sure to overlap onto the back collar.",
        "This will cause the back collar to angle towards the braid and create a Y-shape.",
        "For a more durable finish, sew or glue the narrow end of the rectangle to the top of the braid before you begin wrapping it.",
        "Cut the excess strip off and sew it down.",
        "Finish wrapping the rectangle strip behind the shirt, then cut the rest off.",
        "Hand sew the end down making sure that you don't push the needle through the front of the braid, otherwise the stitching will show.",
        "A basic running stitch will work the best, but you can use a whipstitch too.",
        "If you can't sew, you can  glue the end down instead with fabric glue.",
        "Try to use a thread color that matches the shirt fabric for this step."
