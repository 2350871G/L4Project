        "If this bothers you, mirror the image using an image editing program first.",
        "If you don't have access to a laser printer, you can try using an inkjet printer with a dry toner.",
        "Decide between regular Mod Podge or Mod Podge Transfer Medium.",
        "Regular matte Mod Podge will make the image translucent so that the surface's texture (ie: wood grain) will show through the photo.",
        "Mod Podge Transfer Medium is white, and it will make the photo opaque.",
        "If you are using fabric, choose Mod Podge Transfer Medium.",
        "Cut the image down to the size you want.",
        "If the image has a white border on it, be aware that the boarder will show up after you transfer it.",
        "If you don't want this white border, cut it off.",
        "Use a metal ruler and a craft blade for sharp, clean lines.",
        "You can also use a paper slicer instead.",
        "Apply the Mod Podge to the front of the image.",
        "Set the image face up on top of a sheet of paper\u2014a silicone mat would be better.",
        "Apply the Mod Podge using a foam brush.",
        "Make sure that you coat the image thickly and evenly.",
        "Place the image face-down onto your desired surface.",
        "Smooth it don using a rubber roller or brayer.",
        "If any Mod Podge leaks out from under the image, wipe it off immediately.",
        "Allow the project to dry for 24 hours.",
        "This may seem like a long time, but the paper must be fully dry before you move onto the next step.",
        "If you get impatient and move on too soon, the image may not transfer properly.",
        "Wet the paper, then rub it off.",
        "Dampen the back of the paper with a wet sponge or towel.",
        "Gently rub off the paper backing using your finger.",
        "Take your time and go slowly.",
        "As you rub the backing away, the image will begin to appear!",
        "Don't rub too hard, or you will rub the actual image off.",
        "Repeat the process if there is any paper residue stuck to the transferred image.",
        "Allow the project to dry for 72 hours.",
        "This will give the Mod Podge enough time to cure.",
        "If you move ahead too soon, you will risk the surface getting tacky.",
        "For a more vintage-y touch, lightly sand the edges of the image before you seal it.",
        "Seal the project.",
        "You seal it with regular Mod Podge or with a clear, acrylic sealer spray.",
        "Let the sealer dry completely before using the project.",
        "This could take a few hours to a couple of days depending on what you used.",
        "Use a clear, acrylic sealer for fabric.",
        "You can wash fabric as long as you follow the directions on the Mod Podge Transfer Medium bottle.",
        "Finished."
