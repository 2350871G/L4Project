Once you've chosen a zipper, measure its total length. This should include the small bit of fabric on the ends of the zipper pull. The total length of the zipper will be the length of your pouch. For example, you might buy a 9 in (23 cm) zipper, but once you measure the fabric ends, it will be 10 \u20442 inches (27 cm) long. This means the fabrics for your pouch need to be 10 \u20442 inches (27 cm) long. Make the width for the pouch as wide as you like. For a narrow pouch that might hold something thin like pencils, measure the width of the fabric to be 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). If you want a wide pouch that could hold makeup, toys, or diapers, measure the fabric to be around 6 \u20442 inches (17 cm). Use fabric shears to cut 4 equal-size pieces of fabric. Now that you know how long and wide you want the pouch to be, cut 2 outer pieces of fabric and 2 pieces of fabric for the lining. Each piece should be the same size. For example, to make a standard size pouch, cut each piece of fabric into a 6 \u20442 by 10 \u20442 in (17 by 27 cm) rectangle. Sewing the First Side of the Pouch Lay the zipper along the top of a lining piece. Arrange 1 of the lining pieces on your work surface so the design is facing up. Then place the zipper across the top of the piece. The zipper should be facing up as well. Ensure that the top of the zipper lines up with the raw edge of the lining fabric and the ends of the zipper match with the edges of the lining fabric.

Sew from the end to the place where you originally started stitching. When you remove the fabric and open it, you should see that the outer piece is connected to the liner and zipper. Stitching the Rest of the Pouch Place the zippered fabric piece on the remaining piece of lining. Take the other fabric lining piece and place it face up on your work surface.
