                    "description": "For best results, wait to braid your hair until it has been a day or so since you last washed it. If your hair gets really greasy between washes, try using dry shampoo. Before you begin to braid, brush your hair to remove any tangles. Dry shampoo will also give your short hair a bit more texture, which makes it easier to grip as you braid it. If your hair is too clean, the strands of the braid may easily slip out and come undone."

Make each strand about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Hold each strand of hair between separate fingers so they don\u2019t get mixed up. For example, the first strand could go between your thumb and forefinger, the middle strand could go between the forefinger and middle finger, and the last strand could go between the middle finger and ring finger.

Try to keep each section even so that it looks uniform all the way down. If your hair is really short and you\u2019re worried about the sections coming undone if you tug them, you can simply place your fingertips over the braided section and gently shake them back and forth. This should create a little bit more volume without compromising the braids. However, it may also create some frizz."

Adding hair to each strand as you braid gives your reverse French braids more volume, and it incorporates all the hair on your head nicely. Join hair to the strand in the back and cross it under the middle section. Take 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair from along your part line, and add it to the back strand of hair.

        "Keep in mind that you can always use bobby pins to tuck in any wayward strands after you\u2019ve finished the braid.",
        "Add more hair to the front strand and cross it over the middle.",
        "Take the strand of hair that\u2019s at the front of your head, and gather about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) more hair to make the strand thicker.",
        "Pass the combined strand over top of the middle strand.",
        "Gather more hair to the back strand and cross it over the middle one.",
        "Add 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair from your part line to the back strand that you\u2019ve been holding.",
        "Then take that strand and pass it over the middle one so it becomes the middle strand itself.",
        "If you\u2019re new to French braiding your hair, it\u2019s okay if it takes a while to get the hang of the movements; just keep practicing!",
        "Braid your hair toward the back of your head.",
        "Repeat the process of adding hair to the front and back strands and passing them over the middle strand to create your French braid.",
        "Move the braid at an angle so that it lines the middle of your parted section.",
        "Keep the tightness of your braids the same as you go along so that it looks even.",
        "Stop braiding when the end of the braid is level with your ear.",
        "Once your braid has reached about halfway down your head, you can stop braiding.",
        "End the braid right around where you would secure a half-ponytail.",
        "While you could continue the braid to the base of your scalp, it may look odd since the other side of your hair is going to be left down.",
        "If your hair is longer than 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm), braiding to your scalp might create a cute look, but very short hair may look weird.",
        "Secure the braid to the hair beneath it with an elastic tie.",
        "To keep the braid from sticking out from your head, gather about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hair from underneath and around the end of the braid.",
        "Secure the elastic tie around that hair and the braid so they\u2019re combined together.",
        "Choose a hair tie that matches your hair so it will blend in.",
        "You could also place several bobby pins across the end of the braid to secure it in place rather than using an elastic tie.",
        "Tug each section of the braid to give it more volume.",
        "Once the braid is secured, gently grasp and tug at each individual section, loosening the actual braid itself.",
        "Doing this adds volume to your braid.",
        "Try to keep each section even so that it looks uniform all the way down.",
        "If your hair is really short and you\u2019re worried about the sections coming undone if you tug them, you can simply place your fingertips over the braided section and gently shake them back and forth.",
        "This should create a little bit more volume without compromising the braids.",
        "However, it may also create some frizz.",
        "Use hairspray on the braid to help keep the strands in place.",
        "If you have lots of flyaway hairs or short strands that you\u2019re worried about staying in place, just spritz some hairspray over the braid and let it dry.",
        "Style the rest of your hair as normal.",
        "You could straighten your hair or create curls.",
        "Creating Reverse French Braid Pigtails Start with dry hair that hasn\u2019t been washed in 1 to 2 days.",
        "Use slightly dirty hair to help your braids stay in place better.",
        "If you need to, use dry shampoo to absorb grease when you can\u2019t shower.",
        "Additionally, the dry shampoo can even give your hair some more texture, which will make it easier to braid.",
        "Clean hair might be too slippery to stay in place in the braids.",
        "This is especially true for straight or fine hair.",
        "Use a comb to part your hair down the middle.",
        "Take your comb and line it up lengthwise with the middle of your forehead.",
        "Bring the comb back, creating a straight line down the middle of your scalp and pull it through all the way to the base at the back.",
        "For a more natural look, use your fingers instead of a comb.",
        "Tie off one side of the hair to keep it out of the way.",
        "Gather all the hair on one side of your part.",
        "Use an elastic tie to create a loose pigtail.",
        "If you leave all your hair loose after you\u2019ve made your part, you\u2019ll probably lose the part and accidentally get hair from one side of your head in the wrong braid.",
        "Divide the hair at the front of your head into 3 sections.",
        "Start your braid on the side with loose hair.",
        "Create 3 1 inch (2.5 cm) strands, and hold each strand between separate fingers to keep them apart.",
        "To start any French braid, you simply begin with a normal 3-strand braid.",
        "Cross the first section of hair under the middle section of hair.",
        "Carefully pass the strand of hair that is closest to your face underneath the middle section.",
        "Keep the sections of hair separate from each other.",
        "For the classic French braid, simply cross your sections of hair over the middle section, rather than under.",
        "Pass the back section of hair under the new middle section of hair.",
        "Take the strand of hair that is furthest away from your face, and pass it underneath the middle section to create the first full pass of your braid.",
        "Take your time so you don\u2019t accidentally mix the strands together.",
        "If you have really short hair, make your braids as tight as possible.",
        "This will help the strands stay in place.",
        "Add hair to the strand in the front and pass it under the middle strand.",
        "Gather about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair from the front of your hairline, and add it to the front strand.",
        "Take that strand of hair, and pass it underneath of the middle strand of hair.",
        "Adding hair to each strand as you braid gives your reverse French braids more volume, and it incorporates all the hair on your head nicely.",
        "Join hair to the strand in the back and cross it under the middle section.",
        "Take 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair from along your part line, and add it to the back strand of hair.",
        "Take that back strand, and cross it underneath of the middle strand of hair.",
        "If you find yourself getting confused, that is okay!",
        "Just take your time and remember that you can always start over if you need to.",
        "It takes time to learn how to French braid.",
        "Repeat this process until you reach the base of your scalp.",
        "Continue gathering more hair from your hairline and from the part line and adding them to your strands of hair.",
        "Braid your hair back until you reach the nape of your neck.",
        "Use both of your hands as you braid, but remember to keep each strand of hair separated from the other ones.",
        "Create a mini pigtail by securing an elastic tie around your hair.",
        "Use a tie and secure your pigtail close to the base of your head.",
        "Keep that position in mind as you move on to braid the next side so you can make your braids look even.",
        "Normally, the ponytail section of the braid would be braided, too.",
        "But with short hair, it\u2019s going to turn out better if you just put it into a ponytail, or even a small messy bun.",
        "Complete the braiding process again on the other side of your head.",
        "Take the rest of your loose hair, and braid it the same way you did the first side.",
        "Remember to take your time, and try to keep the spacing of your strands even to what you did on the first side.",
        "Keep your braids tight so they don\u2019t come loose.",
        "Spray some hairspray over your braids to help them stay in place.",
        "If you have flyaways or short strands of hair that you\u2019re concerned about, just spray a little bit of hairspray overtop of each braid.",
        "Keep your hands from getting sticky by letting the hairspray dry before you touch your braids again.",
        "If you\u2019re going to be out running around, bring a miniature can of hairspray with you so you can fix any sections that come loose during the day."
