If you have adhesive wallpaper, pull out a length big enough to cover 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) past the door. Peel the back off and carefully cover the door before cutting the excess portion off with a knife. If you need to glue the paper, cut it to size with scissors or a utility knife and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to cover the door with adhesive or glue. This is a great option for sliding doors that don\u2019t have knobs or handles that stick out. Get an extra roll or two of wallpaper in case you mess something up and have to redo a section.

Purchase a hidden door kit from a company that specializes in manufacturing hidden doors.Tip: Installing a hidden door can be kind of complicated if you don\u2019t have much experience building things. Consider hiring a contractor to install it for you. This process typically costs between $800-1,500. Unless you\u2019ve got a big walk-in closet, make sure that you get a hidden door that swings out into your room. You can buy hidden doors that swing either inwards or outwards. Get a pre-painted door if you don\u2019t want to do the painting yourself. These doors come preassembled, but you\u2019ll have to do some construction to remove the frame and install the brackets. Remove your door by prying out the pins with a screwdriver and hammer. Open your door and slide 2 books underneath it to brace it. Pry the pins in the hinges out by pressing the tip of a flathead screwdriver under the bulb at a 45-degree angle and hitting the bottom of the handle with a hammer. Pry the bottom pin out first, followed by the top, and leave the middle hinge for last. Hold the door when you\u2019re lifting the middle pin out to keep the door steady as you\u2019re removing it. If you can, enlist a friend or family member to hold the door for you as you\u2019re removing the middle pin. You don\u2019t need to pop the pins all the way out. You can simply pop them out 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) and lift it out by hand. Unscrew the hinge brackets on the door frame with a screwdriver to take them out. Pry the frame of the door out if your door requires it. Some hidden doors allow you to leave the old frame in place. If you do need to actually remove the frame, use a chisel to dig in between the wood panels and the drywall. Pull it up near the corner to pop the nails out. Carefully remove the panels one piece at a time. This process shouldn\u2019t be too hard once you pry a corner of the wood up. The panels will have nails sticking out of them, so work slowly and carefully. If you don\u2019t need to install the frame, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to see where you need to install the brackets for your new door. You may be able to pull the frame out in a single piece depending on how it was installed. Set your door jamb panels up and make sure they\u2019re level. Starting at the bottom, place each piece of your door jamb in the corresponding location one at a time. Once a piece is resting against the drywall, check to see if it\u2019s level using a bubble leveler. If there is a gap in the jamb or threshold, use a shim to push the panel into the level position. Place the shim between the wall and the panel, pushing it in until the door is level. Trim the excess portion off with a utility knife and glue the shim to the panel with wood glue. You can also use a circular saw to cut a panel at an angle, although this is usually unnecessary. You can glue the shim into the wood using wood glue if you\u2019d like. Use a nail gun to nail your door frame together. Lay your panels out on a level surface. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions regarding the placement of the nails. Nail your frame together at the joints where the panels meet with standard construction nails. With your frame together, lift it up and set it inside your doorway. Make sure that all of your brackets are facing the same direction so that you can hang your door to open the right way. Check your frame again with a level before installing it. Apply shims as needed to get frame level. If the brackets for your door aren\u2019t facing the same direction, you won\u2019t be able to hang it. Make sure that your door is going to swing in the right direction. If you need to, you can flip your door around if the surrounding drywall isn\u2019t too uneven. Place shims in between the frame and the wall and drill the frame in. With your frame in the doorway, slide wooden shims into both sides of the door at the bottom, top, and sides to keep it in place. Once the shims are firmly in place, break off the excess portions with your hammer. Screw the frame into the drywall by drilling #10 screws into the frame where the shims rest. Run 6-10 screws through each side of the door to set it in place. If possible, have a friend brace the door frame to keep it still while you\u2019re installing it. That way, it won\u2019t move as you\u2019re driving the screws into place. Make sure that your brackets are facing the same direction you want to hang your door. Some concealed doors swing inwards and some swing outwards, so double check the brackets before installing the frame. Hang the door by placing the pins into the brackets. Most hidden doors are designed to make this part easy. Simply lift the bookshelf or mirror door up and slide the slots for the brackets on top of one another. If the pins are preinstalled, slide the door into the brackets. If you need to install the pins yourself, brace the bottom of the door with your foot and dominant hand. Hold the door in place with the brackets on top of one another and slide the pins in place. If you need to install the brackets yourself, screw them into the locations where they\u2019re marked to be installed. Install the frame panels with wood glue and nails. Once your door is hanging, take your trim and apply wood glue to the back of each piece. Place them over the gap where the jamb meets the drywall to hide it. Push each panel into the corresponding location carefully to keep each panel flush with the frame. Once the trim is in place, put small nails in your nail gun and fire 1 nail every 10\u201320 in (25\u201351 cm) along the frame to finish your door. If you have a hidden bookshelf door that is unpainted, paint it with 2-3 coats of your preferred color if you want to give it some color.",
