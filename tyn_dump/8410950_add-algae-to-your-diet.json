And though spirulina contains many essential nutrients (calcium, niacin, potassium, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, essential amino acids) it is not known how much of the nutrient your body can actually absorb from spirulina. Spirulina is probably safe for most healthy adults, but if contaminated, it can cause liver damage, nausea, vomiting, thirst, weakness, rapid heartbeat, shock and even death. Carefully research the source of any supplements to ensure they are tested for toxins and are grown in safe conditions. Speak with your doctor, registered dietitian, and/or pharmacist before trying spirulina. Get advice on dosing from your doctor, as there has not been enough testing to establish a safe dose range. People with multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions should not take spirulina. Do not give spirulina to children. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid spirulina. Note that the FDA does not regulate supplements for content, labeling, or safety. Look for products that have been tested by an outside source, such as USP or NSF."
