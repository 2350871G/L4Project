Put a hose attachment on your vacuum, point it at a fly, and watch it get sucked up. It's simple to use and stops you from having to run around all day trying to swat these quick pests. If you don't have a good vacuum, you could also get an electrified fly swatter. It is way more effective than a regular one and works outdoors as well. Once you get close to a fly, the electricity stuns it so you can get rid of it."

Pour in at least 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar, then add about 3 drops of any liquid dish detergent. The soap breaks the surface tension so the flies can't get out once they fall in.

Then, watch as your unwanted house guests crawl in without being able to get out. Sugary foods and drinks make for great bait if you don't have sugar. Try using honey, wine, or even some decaying fruit. You could also add yeast to help bring in the flies. To make your own funnel, cut a piece of paper into a circle, then cut a wedge out of one side. Fold the cut ends together to create a cone with about a 0.39 in (0.99 cm) bottom opening. Tape the ends together to hold the cone in place. Another way to make a cone is by cutting a soda bottle in half. Put the bait in the bottom portion. Remove the cap from the top portion, turn it upside down, and insert it into the bottom portion."

Electric zappers produce a loud noise when flies land on them. If you're not prepared for it, it may be a little annoying. There are some zappers that work well outdoors, which the manufacturer will list on the packaging. These zappers work best when you're nearby. When you don't need them, take them down so they can't attract more flies. You could also get a UV light trap. UV traps are quieter than regular electronic traps.

Add the water to areas like doorways and window sills to keep your home free of pesky invaders. You could chop or grind up fresh cayenne or use dried powder to make the repellant. Dried cayenne is stronger and more effective, but it loses potency faster. Spray more of the repellant when you can no longer smell it in the air. Ginger is another strong spice that repels flies.

Also, keep them around areas you go to when you're enjoying the weather. To plant herbs, use neutral soil or potting soil. You could keep the herbs in small growing boxes, pots, or in the ground. Make sure the soil is well-drained and receives about 6 hours of sunlight each day. These plants are non-toxic, so you don't have to worry about planting them.

For the best result, get a spray with Pyrethrum in it and mist any areas where flies tend to gather. Protect yourself by putting on a respirator mask before using the spray. You may need to repeat this process for up to 2 weeks in order to  fully clean out an area. Since sprays are pretty harsh, clear the treatment area. Keep other people and pets away for several hours as you air out the area. If you're treating small groups of flies that are easy to handle, consider making your own trap first.

        "The flies drop into a plate on the bottom that you can slide out and clean off.",
        "It's kind of fun to hear the loud zap when you're not even breaking a sweat.",
        "Electric zappers produce a loud noise when flies land on them.",
        "If you're not prepared for it, it may be a little annoying.",
        "There are some zappers that work well outdoors, which the manufacturer will list on the packaging.",
        "These zappers work best when you're nearby.",
        "When you don't need them, take them down so they can't attract more flies.",
        "You could also get a UV light trap.",
        "UV traps are quieter than regular electronic traps.",
        "The flies land on glued boards you can remove and replace as needed.",
        "Repelling and Poisoning Flies Mix water and cayenne pepper into a natural spray repellant.",
        "Flies, along with many other bugs, can't stand the heat and will avoid spices.",
        "Add 1 cup (240 mL) of water to a misting bottle, then mix about 1 US tsp, or about 1.80 g, of cayenne pepper into it.",
        "Add the water to areas like doorways and window sills to keep your home free of pesky invaders.",
        "You could chop or grind up fresh cayenne or use dried powder to make the repellant.",
        "Dried cayenne is stronger and more effective, but it loses potency faster.",
        "Spray more of the repellant when you can no longer smell it in the air.",
        "Ginger is another strong spice that repels flies.",
        "Use it when you don't have any cayenne powder lying around.",

        "Set up your new garden near places where flies tend to gather, such as near doors, windows, fruit gardens, and areas with standing water.",
        "Also, keep them around areas you go to when you're enjoying the weather.",
        "To plant herbs, use neutral soil or potting soil.",
        "You could keep the herbs in small growing boxes, pots, or in the ground.",

        "These plants are non-toxic, so you don't have to worry about planting them.",
        "You could even keep small boxes of herbs on your window sills to deter flies.",
        "Stuff herbs into sacks to protect your pantry.",
        "Purchase some small sachets, or perfume bags, then fill them with your favorite herb.",
        "Clove is a good choice, but alternatives like basil and lemongrass work just as well.",
        "Then, set the sack in an area you wish to protect, like your snack cabinet.",
        "It works best in enclosed areas without a breeze to weaken the scent.",
        "Replace the herbs as they start to lose potency.",
        "When you no longer smell the herbs, throw them away and refill the bags.",
        "Blow away outdoor flies with a strong fan.",
        "That little fly bothering you won't be able to stand the force of your mighty fan.",
        "If you're having a party, for instance, position fans around your guests and the food table.",

        "This works indoors as well.",
        "Try it by turning on a ceiling fan near where flies gather.",

        "Use a chemical fly spray to deal with serious infestations.",
        "Chemical fly sprays are quick and effective, but they are also pretty toxic to people and pets.",
        "For the best result, get a spray with Pyrethrum in it and mist any areas where flies tend to gather.",
        "Protect yourself by putting on a respirator mask before using the spray.",
        "You may need to repeat this process for up to 2 weeks in order to  fully clean out an area.",
        "Since sprays are pretty harsh, clear the treatment area.",
        "Keep other people and pets away for several hours as you air out the area.",
        "If you're treating small groups of flies that are easy to handle, consider making your own trap first.",
        "Fruit flies, for instance, are fairly easy to handle with a sugary liquid and a little patience.",
        "Cleaning and Securing Your Home Seal trash in a garbage bag and place a lid on the can.",
        "Garbage is the number one food source for flies, but keeping your home trash-free is never as easy as it sounds.",

        "That food is rightfully yours, so show those flies that they aren't welcome.",
        "Keep your food in sealed containers.",
        "Place the containers in your refrigerator or cupboards, depending on what you're storing.",
        "As the food begins to go bad, get rid of it as soon as possible so the flies don't have a chance to settle in.",
        "Look out for leftovers!",
        "Flies flock to sugary drinks and decaying foods.",
        "That also makes them good for traps, so take advantage of the opportunity!",
        "Clean up spills in your home when you notice them.",
        "Liquid spills are easy to spot and get with paper towels, but don't forget about solid foods.",

        "Search for these gaps by inspecting your home.",
        "Then, seal these areas with caulk, weather stripping, and screens.",
        "Keep your doors and windows closed as much as possible.",
        "With a screen in place, you can open up your home in good weather without worrying about flies getting in.",
        "Pay the most attention to areas where walls meet.",

        "Squeeze a bead of caulk into the gaps to close them off.",
        "Drain standing pools to remove water sources.",

        "Clean and dry these spots so the flies don't have water to drink.",
        "To drain soil, change its slope, aerate it, or mix sand into it.",
        "Also, keep your lawn mowed to reduce the amount of water beneath the grass blades.",
