Cut two whole pickles into quarters (lengthways) for 8 slices. Now all the ingredients are ready to put together Lightly sprinkle each side of the meat with garlic salt and dried parsley.  Place a fourth of a pickle on the meat and roll it up inside.  Wrap a piece of bacon around the meat to hold it together. Usually, the meat is tied up with string to stay together, but wrapping it in bacon (as opposed to putting the bacon inside) is an easy trick so you don\u2019t get stuck with strings at the end. The rouladen is now ready to cook. Brown the meat in a skillet at medium to high heat, turning them every couple minutes to cook each side. They will slow cook all the way through later. When brown, add 2 cups of water to the skillet and bring to a boil, using a spoon to scrape any meat drippings off the bottom of the pan.  Reduce heat to a simmer for 15-30 minutes. The water should still have a slight bubble. Add 1-2 cups of water and \u00bc cup of pickle juice after the 30 minutes, and continue doing this every 15 minutes for two hours total. If you haven\u2019t used all the pickle juice by the end, add the rest. Also, you can always add more water throughout to make sure the meat is covered, depending on how quickly the water evaporates. After two hours, take the meat out of the pan, leaving the remaining liquid. This liquid should taste rich and meaty, yet slightly sour from the pickle juice. Make the gravy for the rouladen. Stir 1-2 teaspoons of beef bouillon into the liquid. Taste it and add more if you want it saltier. Mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to make a thickener. Slowly whisk the thickener into the liquid to make a gravy. It doesn't need to be too thick, but not too thin either. This should be served over the rouladen. Finished.  Jean's rouladen Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC.  Lay a slice of beef flat on parchment paper on a flat surface. Spread mustard over it. Lay the next slice 1/4 way down. Again, spread mustard. Continue adding slices until all are stacked. Spread each with mustard. Roll the meat into a tube. Tie together with meat string. Put the rolled meat into a baking bag. Add 1/4 cup water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add chopped garlic to taste. Reduce the oven heat to 300\u00baF. Place the bag in a baking dish and place in the oven. Cook slowly for 1 hour. Slice the bell peppers, onions and mushrooms as the meat cooks. After an hour, open the bag and add the sliced pepper, onion and mushrooms on top of the meat roll. Close the bag firmly again. Cook for another hour. Then remove from the oven. Allow to sit inside the bag for 30 minutes to cool before opening.  Remove the string. Cut into slices. Serve.
