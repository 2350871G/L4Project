Use a citrus press, a wooden reamer, or a citrus juicer to extract the juice from enough lemons to make 1 cup (240 mL) of juice. If any seeds fell into the juice, use a strainer to sieve them out before moving on to the rest of the recipe. You could zest the lemon rind, too. Use a zester, a microplane, or a vegetable peeler, and zest about 1 tablespoon (6 grams) of the yellow part of the lemon peel and add it to the lemon juice. This will add more fragrance to your lemonade, as well as a little bit of bitterness."
