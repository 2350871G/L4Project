Check the growing instructions for the plants you want to grow before you choose your spot. If your plants need full sun, find a spot in your yard where there is a lot of direct sun for the majority of the day. If your plants need partial shade, observe your yard throughout the day to see where the shady spots are. Put your garden in one of these patches."

If you have to choose a spot that is sloped, you will need to terrace the beds by building them up with boards, flat rocks, or wood slabs. Make sure the spot is at least ten feet from trees and shrubs. You do not want the roots of trees or shrubs to get into the garden plot, as this can disrupt the plants.

You can then rotate the different beds to have healthy crops every year. A smaller plot of 100-200 square feet can fit four to six beds. A larger plot can fit eight to ten beds. The beds should be 4 feet or less wide so they are easy to weed and tend. You should also include 21 inch (53 cm) pathways between the beds so you can roll a wheelbarrow through it. If you buy a raised garden bed box, you may not need to worry about having a pathway between the beds. Instead, make sure you place the boxes with enough space between them to walk through."
