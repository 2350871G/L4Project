                    "description": "You can attach bamboo screening to wood fencing, chain link fencing, or concrete. Take a look at your yard and determine where you want to install your screening. Use a measuring tape to calculate the length of the area you want to cover. Jot these numbers down to reference them when ordering your bamboo. You don\u2019t need to cover your entire yard. Many people install screening along one section of their fencing to create an accent wall or cover up a damaged or ugly portion of their fence. Bamboo rolls typically come in 6\u20138 ft (1.8\u20132.4 m) rolls. Expect to spend $100-200 on each bamboo roll depending on the height that you choose."

                    "description": "You can cover your fence entirely, have your fence poke out a little at the top, or have the bamboo extend past your fencing. This is completely a matter of personal preference. Use a measuring tape to determine how high you want the fencing will go. Write this measurement down alongside the length you\u2019re going to cover to reference it when you\u2019re ordering your screening. You can purchase custom-sized bamboo screening if you live near a company that cuts bamboo to size, but most bamboo screening is 3.5 ft (1.1 m), 4 ft (1.2 m), 5 ft (1.5 m), 6 ft (1.8 m), or 8 ft (2.4 m) tall. If your fence doesn\u2019t match these heights, decide whether you want the bamboo to be a little short or a little tall."

Bamboo screening comes in preassembled rolls, so you can\u2019t trim or replace individual stalks that break off during installation. There aren\u2019t a ton of bamboo screening manufacturers, so you probably have to have it delivered. You may be able to pick it up in a truck if you live near the company, though! You can install screening on both sides of a fence if you\u2019d like to cover it entirely. If you do, order twice as many bamboo rolls."

Write this measurement down alongside the length you\u2019re going to cover to reference it when you\u2019re ordering your screening. You can purchase custom-sized bamboo screening if you live near a company that cuts bamboo to size, but most bamboo screening is 3.5 ft (1.1 m), 4 ft (1.2 m), 5 ft (1.5 m), 6 ft (1.8 m), or 8 ft (2.4 m) tall. If your fence doesn\u2019t match these heights, decide whether you want the bamboo to be a little short or a little tall. Select a color of bamboo for your screening based on preference. Like other forms of wood, bamboo comes in a variety of colors and stains. Consult with your manufacturer to find what they have available. Natural bamboo is a great choice if you want a naturalistic look, while mahogany or black bamboo can create a modern vibe for your backyard. You can always stain the bamboo after you install it if you want to change its color. Choose the diameter of your bamboo stalks if you have an option. Some manufacturers offer bamboo stalks in different diameters. Choose your thickness based on the look you\u2019re going for. Thinner bamboo blends together visually to create a unique look, while thicker pieces of bamboo are easily identifiable and recognizable. Thinner bamboo may be less than 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter. Thicker stalks may be bigger than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. Purchase rolls of bamboo fencing from a bamboo supplier.

Continue driving screws through the bamboo to attach it to the fence. Place 1 screw every 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) along the support beam at the top. Continue adding your screws by drilling through the bamboo and into the wood behind it. When drilling through the bamboo, place the head of each screw in the center of a bamboo stalk to keep the roll secured to the beam behind it. Drill a screw into the bamboo at the bottom. Start at either end of the bamboo roll. Pull the bottom of the bamboo roll down to make it taut. Drill a 2.5 in (6.4 cm) wood screw through the bamboo and into the support beam at the bottom.

Bamboo rolls aren\u2019t especially heavy, so you really don\u2019t need more than wood screws to hold them in place. Installing Bamboo Screening on Masonry Drill pilot holes through your support beam and into the grout on your masonry. Get a 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) piece of wood that\u2019s long enough to match your bamboo roll. Use a masonry drill bit to drill pilot holes through the wood and into the grout at eye level.

You cannot drill the bamboo directly into the masonry since the grout can crumble over time as the bamboo sways a little in the wind. The support beam acts as a platform for the bamboo so it won\u2019t come loose. Install your support beam with masonry drills. Hold your wood support beam up to the masonry so that the pilot holes on the wood and the pilot holes on the masonry overlap. Then, use 3.5 in (8.9 cm) masonry screws to install the support beam on the concrete wall. Drill a screw into each pilot hole to ensure that it is completely secured to the wall. Install a second support beam underneath your first beam. Drill a second set of pilot holes 1 ft (30 cm) off of the floor and parallel to your first support beam. Then, repeat the process with another 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) wood beam. Use masonry screws to attach the beam to the masonry. Unroll your bamboo against the support beams and hold it in place. Lean your roll of bamboo against the end of the support beams and unroll it in the direction of the beams. Hold the bamboo steady and gently push down on any bamboo stalks that aren\u2019t flush against the wall.

Repeat this process at the bottom of the bamboo to finish installing it. Finish installing your bamboo screening by installing a second set of wood screws at the bottom of the bamboo. Place each wood screw 12 inches (30 cm) apart and place them directly underneath the screws at the top. Attaching Bamboo to a Chain Link Fence Unroll your bamboo against the chain link fence. Set your bamboo roll vertically against the chain link fence where you want the bamboo to start. Unravel the bamboo in the direction that you want to cover. The entire roll has to be set against the chain link fence to install it, so get help from a friend if the roll is too big and unwieldy. It is exceptionally tricky to install bamboo on both sides of a chain link fence, so you\u2019re better off not doing this on your front yard unless you only want to cover the exterior fence. Slide some galvanized wire around the end of the bamboo and the chain links. Get a roll of galvanized wire that is at least 3 feet (0.91 m) longer than your bamboo roll. Start at either end of the bamboo. Slide the wire around the outside of the first bamboo stalk and pull it through to the opposite side of the chain link fence. Run galvanized wire through the fence and bamboo. Wrap the wire around the outside of the fence and then run it through your second bamboo stalk. Continue this process until you\u2019ve wrapped the wire around every stalk and every portion of the chain link fence.Tip: If you don\u2019t live in a particularly windy area, feel free to skip a few stalks every time you wrap the wire around the bamboo. For example, you can wrap the wire around every third, fourth, or fifth stalk. Wrap the wire around chain links on both end and crimp them. Pull the wire tight on both ends to pull the bamboo taut against the fence. Then, wrap the excess wire on each end around a chain link next to it. Wrap it 3-4 times around the chain and use a crimping tool or channel locks to bend the wire tightly at the end to secure it. Don\u2019t use all of your weight to pull the wire tight before crimping it. If you pull too hard, you may crack the bamboo. Use zip ties to provide additional support at the top of the fence. Starting at the end of the bamboo at the top, wrap a zip tie around the first stalk and the chain link behind it. Run the plastic end through the small notch on the other side of the zip tie and pull it tight. Then, add additional zip ties every 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) along the top of the roll. Secure your screening by wrapping zip ties around the bottom. With the top of the fence secured, move to the bottom of your fence. Starting 1 foot (30 cm) off of the ground at the end of your fence, wrap another zip tie around the bamboo and the chain link fence. Continue installing zip ties by adding them once every 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) until you\u2019ve fully secured your fence to the bamboo.",
