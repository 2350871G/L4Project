Performing a Burn Test Find a sink to work over. This way, you will have water handy in case the flame goes out of control. Make sure that there is nothing near by that can catch on fire, such as curtains, towels, or detergents. If you can't work over a sink, try to work over a bowl of water. Create a flame.
