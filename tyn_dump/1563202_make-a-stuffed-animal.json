Sometimes patterns like stripes or chevron can be difficult to line up. You can buy fabric at most craft and hobby stores. If you\u2019d rather not go out and buy fabric, consider repurposing some old fabric. You could easily use an old dress shirt, tablecloth, or towel to create your stuff animal."

        "Stuff your animal.",
        "Once you turn your fabric, you\u2019ll need to begin filling your animal.",
        "You want to fill it without straining the staples or glue.",
        "For this project, you can find stuffing at local craft stores.",
        "Use your hands to push the stuffing in as much as you can, and use the end of a wooden spoon, a dowel, or a chopstick to help push the stuffing into all the hard-to-reach corners of your animal.",
        "Close up the gap.",
        "After you\u2019ve stuffed your animal, you\u2019ll want to use a few staples or another line of glue to seal up the small hole in your animal.",
        "Even if you used staples around the perimeter of your animal, consider using glue for this small hole so that you won\u2019t have any visible staples.",
        "Tuck the raw edges of the fabric in so that they don\u2019t show.",
        "Decorate your stuffed animal.",
        "After you\u2019ve finished the basics, you can add more character to your creation to make it unique and special.",
        "Decorations come in all kinds of forms and can be made from fabric scraps, things you have around the house like buttons, or even just drawn on with markers.",
        "Glue on buttons or googly eyes.",
        "Again, be careful with these around small children, as they can be choking hazards.",
        "Use a fabric paint or fabric markers to draw on other features.",
        "You can even use scrap fabric to hot glue or staple together clothes for your stuffed animal."
