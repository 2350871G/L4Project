        "Continue drilling through the drywall at each of your marks.",
        "Slide \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) toggle bolts into each of the holes.",
        "Toggle bolts have a hinged wing on the end that holds the bolt securely against your drywall, and they\u2019re hollow so you can screw things into them.",
        "Pinch the wings at the end of the toggle bolt and push them into the holes you drilled.",
        "Once the wings go through they will open and lie flush with the back of the drywall.",
        "You can buy toggle bolts from your local hardware store.",
        "Toggles bolts are typically not included with the TV mount.",
        "Push the toggle bolts' anchors into the holes so you can snap off the ends.",
        "The anchor is the small circular plastic piece on the front of your toggle bolt.",
        "Slide the anchor into the hole so it\u2019s flush with your drywall.",
        "Once the anchor is secure in the wall, bend the long plastic pieces sticking out from the wall to break them off.",
        "Push the anchors in on the rest of your bolts so they\u2019re flush with the wall.",
        "If you have trouble breaking the plastic guides off of the bolts, you can cut them with a pair of scissors or a flush-cut saw.",
        "Screw the mount into the toggle bolts with a screwdriver.",
        "Hold the mount against the wall so the holes line up with the toggle bolts.",
        "Put the screws that came with your TV mount through each of the holes and turn them clockwise to tighten them in the toggle bolt.",
        "Once they\u2019re hand tight, use a screwdriver to secure the mount the rest of the way.Warning: Don\u2019t use a drill to tighten the screws since you could overtighten them and damage your drywall.",
        "Hang the TV bracket on the mount.",
        "The bracket on the back of your TV will have hooks or clips that slide onto the mount.",
        "Lift your TV up carefully on each side and line up the hooks with where they fit in on the mount.",
        "Slowly let go of the TV to make sure it doesn\u2019t fall off the mounts before tightening any screws or bolts that hold the bracket in place.",
        "Have a friend help you lift the TV or look where the bracket lines up with the mount to ensure you have it in the correct place."
