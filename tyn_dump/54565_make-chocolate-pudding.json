Whisk the mixture gently to combine the ingredients. Use a nonreactive saucepan if you have one available. Nonreactive saucepans don't react with heated foods and they also disperse heat more evenly than reactive pans. Look for stainless steel saucepans, rather than aluminum, cast-iron, or copper. Whole milk is the best for making chocolate pudding. It still works out well with 2%, however, if the percentage is lower than this the pudding may turn out to be too thin."
