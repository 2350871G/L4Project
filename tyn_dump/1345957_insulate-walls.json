                    "description": "Before you buy fiberglass insulation batting, you need to find out how much you'll need. To do this, you'll need to take measurements of the total area of the individual walls to be insulated, and also the width of the space between the studs. Count up the number of wall gaps you have that need insulation and buy insulation batts accordingly. For the most part, studs will be built at uniform spacing, and batting is manufactured to fill those gaps. It should be the perfect width. Still, it's a good idea to count up the number of spaces you have and take a measurement to make sure you don't come home with the wrong size."

There are various grades of insulating batting for different locations in the house, so you'll need a different insulation for interior, exterior, attic or basement walls. The R-value of the batt measures the thermal resistance, so the higher the R-value, the more effectively the batt insulates. Typically, for interior walls, R-13 batts are used for 2 x 4 studs and R-19 batts are used for 2 x 6 studs. Note there are two R-value scales; US customary and metric. The US scale is approximately 5.68 times the metric scale, so R-13 in the US is equivalent to R-2.3 elsewhere. You'll also need to choose between faced batts, which have a paper \"face\" on one side that will cover the insulation to the outside, and un-faced batts, which are just the fiberglass."

Recycled denim is regularly turned into a kind of insulation that's quite effective, and without the microfiber air problems that some people complain about with fiberglass. Mineral and sheep wool, cementitious, and cellulose-based insulation's are also common alternatives to fiberglass. You need to only use materials that have a thermal resistance rating.

Lay the insulation out, then carefully use your utility knife to cut through the face (if you've purchased faced insulation). It's kind of hard to cut through the insulation itself, which has the consistency of tenacious cotton candy, but you can pull it apart once you get it started. When you get your insulation home, keep it wrapped up until you're ready to use it. Cutting fiberglass insulation sends lots of little fiberglass particulate up into the air, which can cause allergic reactions and breathing problems. It's also extremely itchy, and can cause rashes in some people with sensitive skin. Never touch fiberglass batting with your bare hands and always wear breathing equipment when handling it. If you come into contact with fiberglass insulation, don\u2019t scrub your hands or face with water, which can cause micro-abrasions. Dust yourself off outside and wash your clothes immediately."

Insulation needs to be kept in a layer no deeper than an inch. Over-applying foam insulation can stress the walls and can also clump up and fall off the surface. If you miss, or get insulation somewhere you don't want it, don't panic. Stop and allow the insulation to dry and scrape it off the surface with a putty knife later. Trying to smear it now will make it worse.

        "It's difficult to get out.",
        "It's best to apply spray insulation when the temperature is between 60 and 80 degrees F. Apply the spray from about two feet away.",
        "Attach your sprayer to the canister or bucket of insulation and start spraying, as if you were washing a window or car.",
        "Don't get too close, but stand a few feet back and spray as evenly as you can, back and forth across the area to be insulated.",
        "If you're spraying inside a wall, count to three, then stop and examine your progress to make sure that you aren't over-filling the wall.",
        "Insulation needs to be kept in a layer no deeper than an inch.",
        "Over-applying foam insulation can stress the walls and can also clump up and fall off the surface.",
        "If you miss, or get insulation somewhere you don't want it, don't panic.",
        "Stop and allow the insulation to dry and scrape it off the surface with a putty knife later.",
        "Trying to smear it now will make it worse.",
        "If you need to add multiple layers, because you're spraying an external wall or want extra sound-proofing, wait until the first layer has dried before going back over it as you did before.",
        "This will build up the R-Value of the insulation accordingly, and should stick perfectly well.",
        "Fire-sheath spray-insulated walls.",
        "Spray foam is not a finished surface and will ignite quickly in the event of a fire.",
        "After applying, it's common to drywall over the insulated area to finish the job."
