Here's what you'll need to make ginger ale using the old-fashioned method:\n1 cup (225 g) sugar\n2 tablespoons (30 g) freshly grated ginger root\nJuice of one lemon\n1/4 teaspoon (1.6 g) fresh granular baker's yeast\nCold, pure water Add 1 cup of sugar to a bottle through a dry funnel. Leave the funnel in place until all the steps are complete and you are ready to cap the bottle. Measure out 1/4 teaspoon of fresh granular active baker's yeast. Use any brand that you might buy in the health food store. Add the yeast through the funnel into the bottle. Shake the bottle to disperse the yeast grains into the sugar granules. Grate the ginger root on a fine cutting grater to produce 2 tablespoons of grated root. Use the side of the grater with the finest teeth. Place the grated ginger in a measuring cup.  Juice a whole lemon. Lemon is important to keep the pH level low and ward off unwanted microorganisms. If you don't like lemon, try grapefruit juice instead. Add the juice of a whole lemon to the grated ginger.  Stir the lemon juice and grated ginger to form a slurry, then add it to the bottle. It may stick in the funnel. Don't worry, the next steps will wash it into the bottle. Rinse the container that held the lemon juice and grated ginger with fresh clean water. Add the rinsing water to the bottle. Cap and shake the bottle. This helps activate the yeast and gets the carbonation process going. Reopen and fill the bottle to the neck with fresh, cool, clean water. Leave about an inch of head space, then securely screw the cap down to seal. The head space is necessary to leave room for gasses that will be produced during fermentation. Invert the bottle repeatedly to thoroughly dissolve sugar. Check the bottom of the bottle because the sugar tends to stick in little pockets there. The ginger root will not dissolve, of course.
