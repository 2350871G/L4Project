First, remove the wires from the doorbell switch (the button mechanism), and touch them together. If the doorbell rings, the switch needs to be replaced. If the switch isn't the issue, head to the chime, or the indoor doorbell mechanism. Remove the cover, have a helper press the doorbell button, and test the chime with a low-voltage meter. If the tester lights up, there's something wrong with the chime. Look for buildup in the mechanism, and clean any grime with rubbing alcohol. If that doesn't do the trick, you'll need to replace the chime. If the tester doesn't light up, the chime isn't receiving power, which means the issue is either with the transformer or the wiring between the transformer and chime."

Look in the area around your panel for a small black or silver metal box attached to a beam or to the panel itself. It\u2019ll have wires leading to the electrical panel on one side, 1 to 3 screws on the opposite face, and thinner wires connected to the screws that lead to the doorbell chime. If the transformer isn't near your electrical panel, look around your heating and cooling system. Check behind insulation, especially if you suspect the transformer is in the attic. While less common, the transformer may be under or inside the chime, so check there if you can't find it near your electrical panel or heating and cooling system. It\u2019s best to have a professional replace a transformer in or on an electrical panel, especially if you don\u2019t have experience with home wiring. If the transformer is attached to the panel itself, it may be trickier to replace or require you to disassemble the panel.Tip: If you have trouble finding the transformer, remove the chime box (the indoor doorbell unit) from the wall. If the wires that run through a hole in the wall to the transformer lead up, the transformer is in the attic. If they lead down, the transformer is in your basement or crawl space."

If you find more than 1 set of wires attached to multiple screw terminals, wrap each set with electrical tape so you don\u2019t mix 1 set up with another. For many doorbell transformers, you'll likely need a flat-head screwdriver to tighten and loosen the screw terminals. You'll probably find any screws that hold the transformer in place are Phillips-head, so have both types of screwdriver handy when you make the repair. The thicker wires that run to the electrical panel carry a 120-volt current. This is too powerful for doorbells, so the transformer converts the current to 16 to 24 volts. It then sends the current to the doorbell through the thin, low-voltage wires."

        "After disconnecting the wires on either side of the transformer, check to see how it\u2019s secured to the junction box.",
        "If there are screws, grab your screwdriver and remove them.",
        "If there\u2019s a bolt, turn it counterclockwise with a wrench.",
        "After removing the screws or bolt, take the transformer off of the side of junction box.",
        "The transformer\u2019s wires enter the junction box through a hole in the side of the box.",
        "Gather the wires together and slide them through this hole as you pull the transformer off of the box.Tip: Transformers have various specifications, so take yours to the hardware or home improvement store after removing it.",
        "Ask an employee at the store to help you find a match.",
        "Installing the New Transformer Screw the new transformer onto the junction box.",
        "Start by threading your new transformer\u2019s wires through the hole in the side of the junction box.",
        "Then tighten the screws or bolt that came with your new transformer to mount it onto the box.",
        "Remember to verify the electricity is off before installing the new transformer.",
        "Connect the new transformer\u2019s wires to the ones in the junction box.",
        "Match up the transformer\u2019s black, white, and green wires with the corresponding wires that lead to the main panel.",
        "Twist the ends of 2 matching wires together, cover the connection with a wire cap, then turn the cap clockwise.",
        "Be sure to connect black with black, white with white, and green with green, brown, or a grounding bar or screw.",
        "For added insurance, wrap a strip of electrical tape around the wire cap and protruding wires.Safety Precaution: Call an electrician if there is no grounding wire, bar, or screw inside the junction box.",
        "You may find online guides that advise simply wrapping the transformer\u2019s green wire with a black or white wire, but this is a safety hazard.",
        "Attach the low-voltage wires to the transformer\u2019s screw terminals.",
        "If you taped sets of low-voltage wires together, remove the electrical tape.",
        "Wrap the ends of the wires around a terminal, then tighten the screw to hold the wires in place.",
        "Repeat the steps, if necessary, to attach a second set of wires to the other screw terminal.",
        "If you have wired doorbells on your front and back doors, you\u2019ll likely have 2 sets of low-voltage wires to reinstall.",
        "You can connect the wires to either screw; it doesn\u2019t matter which set of wires connects to which screw.",
        "However, keep the sets separate and don\u2019t attach both to 1 screw.",
        "Replace the junction box cover if you needed to remove it.",
        "If you removed it, place the cover over the junction box so its pre-drilled holes align with the ones in the box.",
        "Turn the screws clockwise until they\u2019re tight, and avoid over-tightening them.",
        "Always use a manual screwdriver or low-power automatic screwdriver to loosen and tighten screws.",
        "Using a drill or other high-powered tool could strip the heads of the screws.",
        "Removing stripped screws is a tough, frustrating job!",
        "Turn the power back on and test the doorbell.",
        "To restore power, flip the circuit breaker switch back on or insert the fuse back into the fuse box.",
        "Head to the doorbell button just outside your door, press it, and listen for the chime.",
        "If you have a second doorbell button, remember to test it as well.",
        "If you hear a chime, congratulations!",
        "You fixed your doorbell!",
        "If you don\u2019t hear anything, turn off the power and double check that your wiring connections at the transformer are tight.",
        "If your connections are tight and the doorbell still doesn\u2019t work, call a professional or install a wireless doorbell."
