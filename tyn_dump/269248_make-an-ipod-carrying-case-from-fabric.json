Trace your iPod faceplate onto the paper side of some fusible webbing. Be as precise as you can. This will directly affect the look of your final product. Iron the fusible webbing onto the back of your material, positioning it where you want the face plate in your final product.  Cut slits in the opening to allow your scissors through.  Cut radiating lines out from the center of the circle up to your traced lines. For the rectangle, cut to each corner. For the circle, cut equally spaced radiant lines. Peel off the paper backing from the fusible webbing.  Iron each point away from the center. Use only the tip of your iron to avoid getting your iron plate sticky. Continue ironing points away from the center. Pull them slightly while ironing to enlarge the opening. Open up your package of Iron-on Mending material.  Trace your faceplate onto the back or \"wrong\" side of the Iron-on mending material.  Line up the view screen and click wheel carefully with the openings in your fabric and trace the outline of the iPod onto the back or \"wrong\" side of your material.  Trim your material to no more than an inch around the tracing. Miter the corners if desired. This will make sewing them slightly easier later. Fold the top and bottom edges over, leaving at least half an inch between the marked edges for the iPod and the folded edge. Pin in place. Measure to ensure that the top and bottom edges are parallel to each other. Adjust pins if necessary. Cut out the openings from the Iron-on mending material. Cut approximately 1-1.5cm outside the marked line. Test fit the patch material to your other fabric and trim to size if necessary.  Line up the openings carefully and iron the patch material into the back side of the other fabric.  Fold the whole thing in half with the patch material to the outside. Test fit to your iPod and pin along the line to be sewn. Sew the side seam as marked and test fit. Adjust as necessary. Trim seam allowance to 1/4 inch (3cm).  Fold several layers of 1/16th ribbon and pass them through the attachment ring you chose. (the author used 8 layers of ribbon.) D-rings, keychain rings, etc. all will work well. Sew the ribbon ends together firmly.  Place the ribbon ends along the seam allowance for the side seam and sew them firmly in place.  Top stitch the edge for additional reinforcement of the attachment point.  Top stitch the center inch of the bottom edge to prevent the iPod from falling out...but leave the corners unsewn to allow the earbuds to plug in.  Voila! ",
