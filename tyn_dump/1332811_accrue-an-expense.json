The principle relating to expenses is called the matching principle. The matching principle dictates that accountants record expenses in the period when they are incurred and that they are offset against their corresponding revenues. The implication of this principle is that you cannot always wait until cash changes hands to record an expense. Say, for example, a company has a biweekly payroll expense of $10,000, but the current pay period is split evenly in half between two accounting periods. That means half of those wages have already been earned at the end of the current accounting period. You must record half of the full amount\u2014$5,000\u2014during the current accounting period even if the employee paychecks won't be written until the following accounting period."
