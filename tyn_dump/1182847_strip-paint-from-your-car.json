You can buy or rent sanders from a hardware store. You can also use a grinder. This strips the paint off much faster. However, it can also damage the metal. Always keep the grinder moving and don\u2019t hover over one spot to avoid denting the bare metal. Another option is sanding by hand, without an electric sander. This is extremely time-consuming, but you will save money. Also, sanding by hand is a better option if you own a classic car to avoid damaging the body. Use a sanding block at the same grit levels as you use for the electric sander."

        "Sand all the areas that you\u2019ll be pouring chemicals on.",
        "Don\u2019t try to strip off all the paint with this sanding.",
        "It only has to disturb the surface so the chemicals can soak in better.",
        "Pour automotive paint stripper onto the car and spread it with a brush.",
        "Start by pouring the chemical onto the surface you\u2019re stripping.",
        "It is a thick, syrupy substance, so it spreads slowly.",
        "Then use a paint brush and spread it around.",
        "Cover all the areas that you want to remove paint from.",
        "Automotive paint stripper is available at hardware and auto stores.",
        "If you can\u2019t find the right product, ask an employee for assistance.",
        "Check the surface area that 1 container of the stripper will cover.",
        "Get more if this isn\u2019t enough to cover your car.",
        "Always read the instructions on the product before using it.",
        "Follow those directions if they differ from the ones given here.",
        "Cover the paint stripper with plastic and let it sit for 15 minutes.",
        "The plastic contains fumes and accelerates the paint stripping process.",
        "Lay the plastic out and press it against the paint stripper.",
        "Then let the mixture sit covered for 15 minutes.",
        "You don\u2019t have to tape the plastic down.",
        "It sticks to the paint stripper.",
        "If the product label tells you to let the paint stripper sit for a different amount of time, follow those instructions.",
        "Scrape the paint off with a putty knife.",
        "Peel the plastic off after 15 minutes.",
        "Most of the paint will turn into a gel-like substance by this time.",
        "Take a putty knife and scrape all the paint off the car\u2019s surface.",
        "Most will come off easily.",
        "Just push the stripped paint off and onto the floor.",
        "This is what the plastic sheet was for.",
        "Some spots might require a bit more scraping.",
        "Rub back and forth a few times if any paint is still stuck.",
        "Put all the plastic sheets in a garbage bag and seal it.",
        "Contact your local trash collection agency to check if you should place in the regular trash or save it for a hazardous waste pickup.",
        "They will likely ask you the main ingredients, so have the packaging nearby to check.",
        "Pour more paint stripper on paint that\u2019s still stuck.",
        "If your car has multiple layers of paint, some might not come off after the first chemical application.",
        "After you scrape off all the loose paint, check the car for remaining spots.",
        "Rub some more paint stripper on it, cover it with plastic, wait 15 minutes, and scrape again.",
        "Repeat this for any spots that still have paint on them.",
        "Wipe the remaining chemicals off with a wet rag.",
        "Use a rag with no soap or solvents.",
        "Then scrub all the areas you poured paint stripper on.",
        "Rinse and re-wet the rag as it soaks up chemicals.",
        "If needed, use a fresh rag when the one you\u2019re using gets too dirty.",
        "After you wipe all the chemicals and paint residue off, remove the tape and plastic from the car.",
        "Don\u2019t use any solvent or other chemicals to wipe off the paint stripper.",
        "Mixing other chemicals could produce toxic fumes.",
        "Sand the metal to prepare it for priming and painting.",
        "Finally, remove any remaining rust and paint with a thorough sanding.",
        "Start with a coarse, 40-grit paper.",
        "Then work up to using a 120, 220, and 400-grit paper.",
        "Wipe down the metal with mineral spirits after each sanding session.",
        "Use a dual-action sander to make this job much easier.",
        "However, you can sand by hand if you don\u2019t have a sander."
