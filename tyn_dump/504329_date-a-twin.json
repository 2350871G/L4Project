        "Consider whether or not extreme closeness between twins is a problem for you or is something that you can live with.",
        "Your presence won't break that bond, so learning to deal with it is your best strategy.",
        "If it doesn't work for you, that's a sign to draw the dating to an end.",
        "As with any dating, check your own emotions and feelings about being with your twin date as a person in his or her own right.",
        "Consider how many people of single birth have a problem with clearly defining who they are in life.",
        "If you wouldn't normally date a person who has issues with self boundaries, then your twin date's closeness with his or her twin will probably become a cause of concern for you.",
        "If you find one twin is very protective of the other twin, even when you are around, and tells you to \"take care of my baby sister well, or else\", or \"treat my brother properly\", this could be a warning signal that the protectiveness will spoil your relationship.",
        "Talk to your twin date about it and decide how you feel after hearing the answers.",
        "Constantly fighting over the presence of a twin in your dating life is a warning sign.",
        "If your twin tells you that their twin will always come first in their life, this signals that the twin hasn't managed to separate his or her needs and future journey from his or her twin.",

        "Avoid making assumptions about twins.",
        "Identical twins are still unique individuals and their interests, tastes, and hobbies may be very different from one another.",

        "The best thing to do when dating a twin is to put the assumptions aside and look to your own feelings about the twin you are dating."
