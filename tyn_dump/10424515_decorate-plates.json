Although permanent markers are generally considered non-toxic, they haven\u2019t been ruled food-safe, so draw only on plates you don\u2019t plan on using. Some design examples you can create are leaves, flowers, or seashells around the plate\u2019s rim. Pens are also good for writing notes or messages. If you would like to decorate a plate you can still eat off of, start with a clear plate. You can flip the plate over and draw your design on the back. Since the marker is on the outside, using the plate is still safe. Another option is to use alcohol ink and rubber stamps. Push the stamp into the ink, then press it against the plate. You no longer have to draw a complicated image by hand."

        "Make sure your design is visible.",
        "You may need to go over some sections again to get the graphite to stick.",
        "Color your design using ceramic paint and a paintbrush.",
        "Keep a cup of water nearby to rinse off your brush when you need to switch colors.",
        "Slowly fill in the traced design.",
        "Start along the edges and work towards the center.",
        "You can also use a ceramic paint pen to darken the outlines so they stand out more.",
        "Look for bake-on ceramic paints at art supply stores.",
        "These paints are semi-glossy and tend to be long-lasting.",
        "Ceramic paint is non-toxic, but it hasn\u2019t been ruled food-safe, so stick to decorating plates you don\u2019t plan on using.",
        "You can also try painting the outside surface of a clear-colored plate so you can still use it.",
        "Bake the plate for 30 minutes at 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C).",
        "Warm up the oven, then put the plate on the center rack.",
        "Give it plenty of time to heat and then cool.",
        "Once it is cool to the touch, it will be safe to use or put on display.",
        "Painted plates can generally be washed in the dishwasher.",
        "The intense heat and force may wear out the paint faster than normal, so wash the plates by hand if that is a concern to you.",
        "Applying Decoupage Glue and Paper Clean the plate with a paper towel dampened in rubbing alcohol.",
        "Scrub the entire plate to eliminate smudges and debris that can prevent the paper from sticking in place.",
        "You can also try using water and dishwashing detergent.",
        "Cut a design out of a thin piece of paper.",
        "You can make a design out of most types of paper.",
        "Tissue paper and vellum work very well, but also try patterned wrapping paper, napkins, or images from a magazine.",
        "Trim the paper into shapes, such as flowers, if you wish.",
        "As an alternative, wrap a piece of patterned paper around the outside of a clear bowl after spreading the glue.",
        "The pattern serves as a simple decoration.",
        "Spread a thin layer of decoupage glue over the plate.",
        "Choose a dishwasher-safe glue, since this is the most water-resistant type of glue available.",
        "Use a foam brush or a soft-bristled paintbrush to cover the area you wish to decorate.",
        "Keep the glue in as thin a layer as possible.",
        "The glue is non-toxic but it isn\u2019t considered food-safe, so only decorate plates you don\u2019t plan on using.",
        "To make more elaborate decorations, consider getting clear-colored plates.",
        "Flip the plates over and decorate the outsides.",
        "Your plate will be safe to use and your decorations will still be visible.",
        "Place the decoration over the glue and smooth it out.",
        "Press down on the paper until it lays completely flat.",
        "Push out any creases or air bubbles.",
        "Any parts that stick up aren\u2019t sealed to the plate and may compromise the decoration later.",
        "Spread another layer of decoupage glue over the paper.",
        "Dip your brush back into the glue and paint over the paper.",
        "Spread the glue as thin as you can.",
        "All you need is a thin layer over the paper to bind it to the plate.",
        "You can add more decorations on top of the second layer of glue.",
        "This can be useful if your design has overlapping parts, such as with a flower.",
        "You could glue on the shape of the flower first, then add details in a second layer.",
        "Dry the glue for at least 2 hours.",
        "Set the plate on a stable surface exposed to open air, such as a countertop.",
        "Over time, the glue will begin to fade, turning a clear color as it dries.",
        "Touch it to see if it still feels tacky.",
        "If it feels sticky, it needs more time to dry.",
        "For the best results, allow the glue to cure for up to 28 days before using or washing the dish."
