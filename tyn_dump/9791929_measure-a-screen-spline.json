Check for clips holding your window screen in and, if you spot any, lift the clips up to unfasten the screen from the window. In most cases, your window screen frame should pop out easily. If your screen frame is secured by clips, they should be located along the left and right sides. After removing the frame, lay it down on a flat surface like a table.

Try not to damage the screen spline as you remove it. You will get the best and most precise readings if you keep the screen spline as intact as possible. If the spline is already broken, remove it gently to keep it as intact as you can. Finding the Diameter of the Spline Use the old spline as a guide for new spline measurements. Do not throw away your screen spline if it was recently damaged. You can still use it to determine the size your new screen spline should be. Use a tape measure to find the diameter of your spline if it's intact. Lay the screen spline on a flat surface and position the tape measure across 1 end of the spline to find the diameter, or width, of the spline. Measure from 1 side of the spline to the other, and write down the number.

Measure all 4 interior sides of the screen with a tape measure and record the length. Use scissors or a sharp knife to cut your spline to the same length. If your previous spline's length is still intact, use it as an additional guideline while cutting the spline to size. Press the spline into place. Starting in 1 corner of the screen, use your hands to insert the spline into the frame groove. Use a spline roller to smooth over any raised areas to make sure it stays secure. Troubleshoot issues with lubricant or by stretching the spline. If the spline does not easily lay flat in the frame groove, try spraying it with a silicone lubricant, available at hardware stores. If the spline is too large to insert into the screen, pull on 1 end to stretch it thinner as you insert it. The spline should return to its original shape and keep a firm hold in the frame.",
