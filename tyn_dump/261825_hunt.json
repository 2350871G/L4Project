Muzzle loading rifles should be at least .40 caliber, and bows should be capable of shooting a broad head arrow capable of delivering a clean kill. Larger game, like elk, wild boar, moose, or bear, should be hunted with larger calibers, such as .30 caliber guns shooting 150 or higher grain soft pointed bullets.

Deer, antelope, and sheep can be hunted with center fire rifles, bows, or muzzle loading rifles. Center fire cartridges should be at least .243 caliber with no smaller than 100 grain soft pointed bullets. Muzzle loading rifles should be at least .40 caliber, and bows should be capable of shooting a broad head arrow capable of delivering a clean kill. Larger game, like elk, wild boar, moose, or bear, should be hunted with larger calibers, such as .30 caliber guns shooting 150 or higher grain soft pointed bullets. Dangerous game hunting requires a gun capable of bringing down charging animals. Give yourself a \"sight\" advantage. Modern bows can be equipped with peep sights, pin sights, illuminated or even telescopic sights. Shot guns usually only have a front bead, although slug guns may have rifle type iron sights, or in some cases laser dot sights. Rifles can be equipped with telescopic sights, iron sights, peep sites, red dot sights, or in some cases, combinations of these. Understand the action or configuration of your weapon. There are single shot, double barreled, pump action, semi automatic rifles and shot guns, each with potentially different mechanisms of action. The same goes for bows: there are re-curve, compound, or cross bows. Some people even hunt with pistols. Use a weapon you are capable of handling with confidence. Practice with your weapon of choice. You should do this until you are confident in your (and its) ability to do the job. You may want to visit a rifle or bow range, a skeet range, or some other shooting facility. You should take your shooting seriously if you plan on being successful. Planning for a Good Hunt Familiarize yourself with the terrain. It's best to do a walkabout of the area you will be hunting in so you know the areas in which your game are likely to bed down. This will also give you the advantage if you hit your prey but have to track it. Take note of any swamps, loose rocks, fallen trees, or any other obstacles that might impede your route to your hunting location. Be aware of natural animal runs through your hunting area. These are frequently the paths your chosen game will travel, and if you have to track your prey, knowing these will be helpful. Memorize or take a picture of the tracks you see on these natural trails. When you return home, you can check these against a track guide. Check the weather conditions. It's best to be prepared for bad weather when you go out hunting, even if the weather report calls for fair weather. Knowing ahead of time about inclement weather or other dangerous conditions can save your life. Gather your supplies. Forgetting something when you are out in the wilderness can be more than inconvenient: it can be dangerous. You should make a checklist and gather the things you will need before going on the hunt. In addition to the emergency supply kit you put together while preparing to hunt, you should also be sure you are wearing an appropriate amount of blaze orange (also called hunter's orange or safety orange) so that other hunters can see you. Inform friends and family of your plans. This way, if you get lost or are the victim of a hunting accident, you will know that help will eventually be on the way. In the wilderness, you can't always rely on a cellphone to get you the help you need. Get permission, if necessary. If you are hunting on the private property of a friend or neighbor, you must be sure you have the landowner's permission and your hunting license before setting out to hunt. It's always best to give your neighbor a warning before heading out to hunt, even if you've been told you can hunt there anytime. This will limit your chances for hunting accidents. Review your map. This will jog your memory from the walkabout you took in preparation to your hunting excursion. This will also remind you of the best route to get there and safest path to your hunting location. Learning About Handling Your Game Learn proper game meat handling. This will change according to the game you are hunting. However, field dressing and hauling a 700 pound elk is not something you want to try without preparation. Take the time to learn what must be done with an animal to avoid wasting the meat you have taken. Make sure you have resources for caring for the meat. You may need pack animals or other means to haul a large game animal. You should also keep in mind that you will need a place to store potentially several hundred pounds of venison, moose, or elk after your hunt is over. Network with other hunters. This can be useful for developing hunting partners, but can also help in the event that you don't have sufficient freezer space. You can also get tips on how to [Field Dress a Deer Carcass] and prepare the meat. Understand time is a factor. A trophy buck might be tempting to drive around and show off, but if the weather is mild, you need to gut the animal and cool the meat as quickly as possible after it is taken. Other game animals have special handling requirements as well. Game birds should be plucked or skinned and dressed soon after they are taken. Rabbits and squirrels should be skinned and dressed before they become stiff. Going on Your Hunt Begin the hunt at an appropriate time. This will depend entirely on your game and regional restrictions. Evening stand hunting for deer may require you to arrive at your stand in mid afternoon. This way the wildlife will calm from your interruption and your scent will dissipate before your game is most active. Enter the hunting area as quietly as possible. You should park your vehicle a considerable distance from the area in which you expect to encounter game, then proceed to your chosen stand or stalking area as quietly as possible. Stop frequently to observe your surroundings. For many beginner hunters, the hardest part about getting wild meat is sitting quietly for hours while waiting for the right animal to walk into your sight. You will be looking for signs, such as droppings, tracks, evidence of foraging, or other indications your game is active in the area. Be mindful of wind conditions while you hunt. High winds often cause game to hide in thick cover or bedding areas, since the wind will make detecting threatening predators more difficult. Wind also may carry your scent to your game, resulting in spooked animals who will flee long before you get near them. Use binoculars or a spotting scope. This is especially useful when hunting open country so you can scan for game. You may find you only see a tip of an antler, or the eye of a well-camouflaged rabbit. Once the animal spooks and runs, it will be difficult to get an accurate shot. Be certain of your target before shooting. Deer and other game animals are a renewable meat resource, but number that can be killed each year is not unlimited. Many species of game have restrictions on the size or sex of the animal you are hunting. Be familiar with local regulations, and make sure your target complies with them. Shoot for a clean kill. As an ethical meat eater, you are now taking firsthand responsibility for the sacrifice of life that must be made to help sustain your own. Once you have identified a meat animal that is safe for you to shoot, strive to get the animal down as quickly and painlessly as possible. You should avoid shooting a game animal that is too far away, moving too quickly for you to properly sight, or is in a position where a miss could result in injury to other hunters or property. If you are not sure of the background, do not shoot. Don't shoot toward or across highways, and never shoot toward buildings or populated areas. Be prepared to track and dispatch a wounded animal. If you do not make a clean kill on what you plan to eat, wait a decent amount of time before following and tracking it down because even wounded animals can run for miles if they suspect that they are being chased. However, it is ultimately your responsibility to make every effort to find the wounded animal and humanely end its suffering. This may mean tracking through rough terrain, patiently looking for blood or other signs showing you the direction of travel until you have found your prey. Practice safe group hunting procedure. If you decide on hunting with a friend or friends, be sure they are also attired in an appropriate amount of blaze orange and that they stay in sight while hunting. Check your gear before returning home; you don't want to bring potentially harmful wild animals into your home by accident. Do not indulge in alcohol or use drugs while hunting, as this may compromise your judgement and lead to injury. Test all your equipment before going out on your hunt. The last thing you want is faulty equipment putting you or you hunting partner(s) in danger.",
