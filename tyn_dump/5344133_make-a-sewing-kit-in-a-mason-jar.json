        "Add a magnetic strip to the back, if desired.",
        "You don't have to do this, but it is a great way to hold all of your pins and needles.",
        "Cut a short strip of magnetic tape, and hot glue it to the back of the pin cushion.",
        "The exact size of the magnetic strip does not matter, but it needs to be a little smaller than the pincushion.",
        "Most magnetic strips have adhesive on the back, but this adhesive is not very strong.",
        "It would be best to hot glue the magnet.",
        "You can use fabric glue for this step as well.",
        "Let it dry completely before moving on.",
        "Finishing and Filling the Jar Fill your kit with basic sewing necessities.",
        "This will include things like sewing pins, needles, thread, and scissors.",
        "They are the most basic supplies you will need in order to do any type of hand sewing.",
        "A thimble, seam ripper, and measuring tape may also come in handy, but they are not absolutely necessary.",

        "Lois Wade\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Crafts Expert\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLois Wade has 45 years of experience in crafts including sewing, crochet, needlepoint, cross-stitch, drawing, and paper crafts.",
        "She has been contributing to craft articles on wikiHow since 2007.",
        "EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tDIY and sewing guru, Lois Wade, responded: \"It depends on your sewing needs.",
        "Of course you'll need a needle and thread and scissors to start, but you can get quite involved if you\u2019re going to do very tailored costumes or work with fabrics that have special handling needs, like voile, knit, leather, or lace.\"",
        "Keep your items small and compact.",
        "Rather than using full-size scissors, go for smaller ones.",
        "If you are using a really small jar, consider using embroidery scissors or the kind that fold up.",
        "Large spools of thread take up a lot of space, so use bobbins instead; thread multiple bobbins onto a piece of ribbon to keep them together.",
        "Some store-bought garments come with spare buttons and closures in tiny, zippered bags.",
        "Add these to your kit!",
        "Add some notions.",
        "This includes items such as buttons, eyelets, zippers, and other types of closures.",
        "Notions are typically sold in packages of 25 to 50, but you don't need to use the entire package in your kit.",
        "For example, instead of including all 50 eyelets of hook-and-eye sets, you might just want to use 5 or 6.",
        "You also do not need to include every color of button out there.",
        "Keep the colors neutral: black and white.",
        "Organize smaller items by packaging them individually.",
        "Don't just dump everything into your jar, or you will spend a lot of time trying to find what you need.",
        "Sort the notions into pill boxes, miniature mint tins, or tiny glass bottles.",
        "You can even buy small, plastic jars or zippered baggies from the beading section of a craft store.",
        "Add fabric and lace trim to give your kit more charm.",
        "These items are not absolutely necessary, but they can give your jar a nice touch, especially if you are giving it away as a gift.",
        "Wrap some ribbon or lace trim around a wooden spool or cork, and add it to the kit.",
        "You can also add in a folded square of fabric or a crochet doily.",
        "Keep the fabric scraps small.",
        "Something between 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) square would be ideal.",
        "Do not overcrowd your jar.",
        "Remember: less is more.",
        "Keep the bulk of your sewing supplies in a cabinet or drawer, and the most important items in your kit.",
        "If you overcrowd your jar, the kit will start to look messy.",
        "Items are also more likely to get broken, damaged, or tangled.",
        "Cater the kit to your needs.",
        "If you find that you do mostly embroidery, then include more embroidery supplies in your kit, such as embroidery needles and thread.",
        "If you find that you use your kit mostly for quick repairs, then focus on items that will get the job done quickly, such as fabric glue or safety pins.",
        "Focus on the colors that you use in your sewing.",
        "If you don't like red, don't own anything red, and never plan on sewing in red, then don't include any red thread, zippers, or buttons."
