If the wound is on another part of the body, fill a clean cup with lukewarm water and slowly pour it over the wound. Repeat this 2-3 times to rinse away any blood or superficial debris and make it easier to see the wound.

The bleeding may stop after only a few minutes of applying pressure, or you may need to keep the gauze in place for up to 10 minutes. Check the wound after 5 minutes to see if it is still bleeding. If it is, press the gauze against the wound for another 5 minutes. If the wound is on an arm or leg, raise the limb above the level of the person's heart. This may help stop the bleeding faster. If you do not have a gauze pad, you could also use a cotton ball, clean paper or cloth towels, or even a rolled up jacket or shirt. Just don\u2019t use your bare hands.

For example, if you have a large piece of glass or metal stuck in the wound, go to an emergency room. Do not try to remove this on your own.
