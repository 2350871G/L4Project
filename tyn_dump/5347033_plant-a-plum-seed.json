If the plum is still rock-hard, it isn\u2019t ripe yet. If you want to ripen a plum faster, leave it on the counter next to a banana. The banana produces ethylene, which will speed up the plum\u2019s ripening process.Tip: Use the seeds from at least 3-4 plums for the best chance at a successful plum tree.

        "If you\u2019re using a plastic cup, poke holes in the bottom with a knife or pen.",
        "Plant the seeds 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep in the soil and water them thoroughly.",
        "Make a small hole in the center of each container with your finger.",
        "Drop a seed into the hole, and then cover it up with soil.",
        "Water the soil until it is damp to the touch.",
        "If you\u2019re concerned about excess water coming out of the bottom of the containers, set them on a drainage plate.",
        "Put the containers somewhere they\u2019ll receive 6 hours of sun every day.",
        "If the last frost has passed, you could put the containers outdoors and then move them back inside when frost returns in the fall.",
        "If you live in a cooler climate, keep the containers in a sheltered area, like a garage or shed, and use a plant light to ensure they get enough sun each day.",
        "More than 6 hours of sun a day is perfectly fine.",
        "They just need that at a minimum to thrive.",
        "Water the soil when the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) are dry to the touch.",
        "If the containers are outside, rainwater should be enough for the seeds unless there is a dry spell of more than 5 days.",
        "If the plants are indoors, check them every 2-3 days to see if they need more water or not.",
        "Over the weeks, you should see new green growth break through the soil.",
        "Plum trees are pretty hardy, so other than giving them water and sun, there isn\u2019t too much else you have to do other than be patient.",
        "Transplant the seeds to a bigger pot every 6-12 months.",
        "Once the tree has begun to grow, you\u2019ll want to replant it in a new container whenever the spread of its leaves outstretches the perimeter of its current container.",
        "If you decide to move your tree outdoors, plant it in the spring 1 ft (12 in) down in the soil.",
        "Most plum trees will start producing fruit after 3-5 years.",
        "Fertilize the trees once a year to encourage their growth.",
        "Use a low-nitrogen fertilizer with a 1-1-1 ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium.",
        "Apply the fertilizer in the fall after the first frost so the trees can absorb the nutrients before they go dormant for the winter.",
        "Always wear gloves when working with fertilizer and follow the directions to mix and disperse it properly.",
        "Some fertilizers need to be diluted with water and sprayed around the roots of the trees, while others get sprinkled over the ground dry.",
        "Prune the trees in the summer to help them produce more fruit.",
        "Use sharp, clean pruning shears to remove any dead, diseased, or dying branches.",
        "Cut them off at a 45-degree angle where they intersect with the trunk.",
        "In general, avoid cutting away any branches until they\u2019re at least 3 years old unless they are obviously diseased or dead."
