Lay two twigs down parallel to each other, then lay two different twigs on top of the first two so that they cross them. (They should look like a square with overlapping corners.) Keep stacking them this way until the walls are as high as you want them to be and then add a roof. If building an outdoor house, make the walls and roof of the fairy house and then cover the whole thing with dirt or mud to make a rounded hobbit-house. Press flat stones into the sides to create walls and add moss to the top to make a thatched roof. Leave a hole where you want the door to be and add a hollow stick, reed, or piece of bamboos  to make a chimney. Press a few pebbles into the dirt leading up to the doorway to make a path of stepping-stones."

Cut four pieces and glue them together to form a rectangular frame that\u2019s the size you want the tabletop to be. When this has dried, lay twigs across the top and glue them to the frame. When the top has dried, cut four pieces to the same length and glue them underneath to form the table legs. Clay furniture is much easier to make but does not look as rustic.
