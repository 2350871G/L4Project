                    "description": "Choose a high-quality dark chocolate, as this will be the main flavor of your finished souffl\u00e9. Chop 6 ounces (170 g) chocolate into small pieces and transfer to a bowl with 1 tablespoon (15g) butter and 2 tablespoons (30ml) freshly-brewed coffee. As you'll be adding extra sugar to the souffl\u00e9 later on, you should choose a dark, bittersweet chocolate to prevent your souffl\u00e9 from being too sweet. A high-quality dark chocolate with around 70% cacao will work excellently for this. The chocolate base is where all of the flavor for the souffl\u00e9 comes from, with the lightness coming from the meringue that is folded in. You can prepare the base ahead of time and store it in the fridge for a few hours until you need to use it."

Put the glass bowl with the chocolate over the saucepan, making sure to keep the bottom of the bowl out of the water. Let the chocolate melt and combine with the other ingredients, stirring occasionally until smooth. Using a double-boiler will apply a very slight heat to your chocolate, which will prevent it from burning. If you can't make a double-boiler, you could also melt the chocolate in a microwave on a very low setting. Heat it for 20 to 30 seconds at a time, stirring often until the mixture is melted."

Take the chocolate off the heat and beat in the yolks of 3 large eggs, saving the egg whites for the meringue. Once everything is fully combined, place the bowl back on the double-boiler and turn the heat as low as it can go. The vanilla extract will complement the flavor of the chocolate, rather than overpowering it. Let the chocolate cool slightly before adding the egg yolks to stop them from cooking. For extra caution, combine a little of the chocolate mixture with the egg yolks before adding them to the remaining mixture. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling. Leaving the chocolate base sitting over the double-boiler will keep it just warm enough to stop the chocolate and butter from solidifying, without cooking the egg yolks. You can leave the chocolate base sitting here while you work on the meringue."

The two egg yolks you have left over when making the meringue can be used to make custard to serve alongside your souffl\u00e9.
