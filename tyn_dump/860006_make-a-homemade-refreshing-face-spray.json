This combination acts as a cooling and soothing mixture for the face. To properly prepare the cucumber, you can either put the diced cucumber in boiled water and leave it to soak overnight before straining, or you can put it in a blender and then strain it through a cheesecloth to get all the liquid out. Cucumber may have a cooling or soothing effect when applied to the skin. Aloe vera has been shown to improve acne and mild burns like sunburn. You may also add \u00bd teaspoon of lemon juice to the mixture for an extra refreshing twist."

The Vitamin E oil is used as a natural preservative, which you can add to any face spray via capsules or by purchasing a bottle of the oil.
