When you're in the mood for a snack, grab a handful and enjoy. For larger snacks, fill a small bowl or a cup and snack on them over time. You should wash your blueberries in hot water for 30 seconds to kill any bacteria on them. Store your blueberries in well ventilated containers to prevent the buildup of moisture and to get the most out of your blueberries. Blueberries mix well with nuts and granola.

Try blueberries as a side to meat dishes like pork chops, turkey, or shrimp. Blueberries also go well with many kinds of greens. Try blueberries in salads, for example. Blueberries also make a convenient side for lunches. They're a highly portable food, and can easily be brought to work or school in a plastic baggie or plastic container. Whip up a blueberry relish for meat and seafood dishes by combining fresh blueberries with diced, pickled onion, and diced tomato. Create a blueberry flavored dressing for your salad by mixing together fresh blueberries with a little blue cheese in a vinaigrette. Throw together a blueberry loaded fruit salad by mixing together a bowlful of blueberries, cut, fresh watermelon, and peeled orange wedges.Serve this as a side to meals."

Blueberries, however, retain their health bolstering antioxidant properties, even after being dried out. These will stay good for long period of time, making them an excellent hiking snack. Dehydrating most fruit has a tendency to concentrate its sugar content. This means that a half cup of fresh blueberries will have fewer calories than a half cup of dried ones. You may want to stick to one serving of dried blueberries per day to prevent yourself from eating too many calories."

        "You may need to make a special trip to the grocery store to purchase some of what you'll need, but most of these items should be available at your local grocery.",
        "These bars are a healthy snack you can enjoy on the go, and this recipe should make 16 bars total.",
        "You'll need:\nAlmond butter (1 cup)\nAlmonds (whole, \u00be cup)\nApple sauce (unsweetened, \u00bc cup)\nBlueberries (dried, heaping \u00bd cup)\nFlaxseed (ground, 1/3 cup)\nHoney (1/3 cup OR  maple syrup)\nKnife (for cutting into bars)\nMixing bowl (large size)\nPan (8\" by 8\" (20.3 by 20.3 cm) baking sheet)\nParchment paper (or wax paper)\nPepitas (1/3 cup)\nPistachios (\u00bd cup)\nRolled oats (1\u00bd cups)\nSpoon (for mixing)\nSunflower seeds (\u00bc cup)\nWalnuts (1/3 cup) Prepare your pan and work area.",
        "Clean and clear an area of your counter.",
        "Take your baking pan and use your parchment paper or wax paper to line it.",
        "The paper should overhang the edges of the pan a little bit.",
        "Then lay out your mixing bowl and ingredients on the counter as well.",
        "You may need to crease your paper to make it fit to the inner contours of your baking pan.",
        "Combine your ingredients in your mixing bowl.",
        "Start by adding your rolled oats, almonds, dried blueberries, pistachios, ground flaxseed, walnuts, pepitas, and sunflower seeds to your mixing bowl.",
        "Use a spoon to mix all ingredients thoroughly.",
        "Then:\nDrizzle your honey or maple syrup and apple sauce to the mixture.",
        "Use your spoon to stir it well, until it is well mixed.",
        "Add your almond butter to the bowl last.",
        "Using your spoon again, mix the contents of your bowl until the almond butter is evenly distributed.",
        "Transfer the batter to your pan.",
        "Take your bowl and position it above your parchment paper lined pan.",
        "Use your spoon or a spatula to push the batter from the bowl into the pan.",
        "Then, use a spoon, your hands, or a mini-roller to spread the batter evenly to even thickness in the pan.",
        "Put your batter in the freezer.",
        "Take your pan and put it in the freezer for a full hour.",
        "The cold of your freezer will cause the batter to firm up and become solid.",
        "After an hour has passed, remove your bars from the freezer and return them to the counter.",
        "You may want to set a timer so you don't forget about your bars in the freezer.",
        "Leaving them in for too long could cause them to become so hard they are difficult to cut.",
        "Because this recipe uses natural ingredients, you may notice the bars are a little more crumbly than store bought brands.",
        "This is completely normal.",
        "Cut your bars and store them in the freezer.",
        "First, clean your counter well or lay down a clean cutting board or cutting mat.",
        "Peel the batter you've spread in the pan from the parchment paper so that it is one, flat slab of batter.",
        "Lay the batter slab on your counter or cutting board/mat, then:\nTake your knife and use it to cut eight long bars from the batter slab.",
        "Cut these in half, and you'll have 16 blueberry snack bars total.",
        "Store your blueberry snack bars in a sealed airtight container in the freezer.",
        "The bars should last up to three weeks.",
        "Fixing a Blueberry, Pineapple, & Oatmeal Smoothie Gather your smoothie making supplies.",
        "This smoothie is a great option if you have children (or adults) in your life that aren't big on breakfast.",
        "This smoothie is packed with nutrients, is quite tasty, and can be whipped up relatively quickly.",
        "You'll need:\nBlender\nBlueberries (fresh, 1 cup)\nBanana (x1)\nPineapple (\u00bd  of a full fruit, chunked)\nIce cubes (about 10)\nMilk (\u00bd cup)\nRolled oats (\u00bd cup)\nGreek yogurt (vanilla recommended; \u00bd cup) Add your ingredients to your blender.",
        "But make sure your blender is unplugged before you do so.",
        "Leaving your blender plugged in when adding ingredients puts you at risk for accidentally activating it, which could send food flying.",
        "After that, fasten the lid of the blender firmly in place and plug it back in.",
        "Always follow your blender's user directions.",
        "Improper usage of your blender could result in serious injury or harm.",
        "Blend your smoothie and enjoy.",
        "Depending on your model and brand of blender, there may be many blending options available.",
        "From among these, find and press the \"Blend\" button for short intervals until the mixture is smooth throughout.",
        "Holding down the \"Blend\" button for extended periods could cause the motor of your blender to overheat.",
        "This can cause damage to the motor or electronics in the blender.",
        "Save leftover smoothie for later in the fridge.",
        "Leftover smoothie can be kept in the fridge for about 12 hours to a day.",
        "Store extra smoothie in an airtight container, with as little air in the container with the smoothie as possible.",
        "Air causes the nutrients in your smoothie to break down more quickly.",
        "By limiting the amount of air in the container, you'll preserve the nutritional value of your smoothie better."
