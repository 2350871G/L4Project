Buy a large pair of sunglasses in the tint that you prefer for your costume, dark or bright. Make sure the glasses have very large lenses.

Apply the second lens. Using the exact same method, glue a thin line to the other lens and then affix it to the inside of the mask, creating the second eye. If you place the lens incorrectly at first, you will have a few seconds to move it before the glue dries. Apply light pressure to the side of the lens to fill the eye-hole while the glue is still hot.

Many craft stores carry inexpensive hot glue guns. Pick one up or use one that you already own. Make sure that you have plenty of glue sticks handy so that you don't run out in the middle of your project. Assembling the Mask Lay your mask out flat. Lay the spandex mask on a flat surface, like a table or desk. Make sure you lay it with the front facing up, because you'll obviously want to draw the eyes on the front of the mask. If you have a styrofoam head or dummy head, feel free to use this as well. It will give you a better vantage point for designing your mask and visualizing it on your own head. Sketch out the eyes.

If you are feeling a bit more ambitious, cut out some black fabric from an old t-shirt in the correct shape, then hot-glue it on. Draw on webs.

Then, use your Sharpie or Fabric paint to draw over the penciled lines. Let it dry. Now that your mask has been hot-glued and accented, you'll need to let it dry. Read your bottle of fabric paint and the hot-glue instructions for specific times. The glue itself may dry in around a minute, but fabric paint may take up to 72 hours to dry, depending on the brand. Try it on. Once your mask has dried, go ahead and try it on. Pair it with a homemade Spiderman costume, or wear it on its own. It'll be perfect for Halloween, Super Hero events, or costume parties.",
