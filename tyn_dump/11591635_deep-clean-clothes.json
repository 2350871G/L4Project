Before strip cleaning your clothing, either rinse your clothes under cold water and wring them out by hand. Alternatively, you can throw your clothes in the washing machine and rinse them. The more residue and dirt you remove before strip cleaning, the more efficient the process will be. Strip cleaning is not recommended for dyed clothing. You can strip clean clothing that says \u201chand wash only\u201d on the label, but avoid using hot water if the tag says \u201ccold water only.\u201d\nStrip cleaning is often used to remove dirt and bacteria from bulky materials like sheets, jackets, rugs, and cushions. You can strip clean most clothing items, though. You can strip clean any amount of clothes, but this process will work best with a smaller amount of clothing. Do not strip clean colors and whites at the same time."
