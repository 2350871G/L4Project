        "Insert four high quality ball bearings and reassemble the drive shaft and axle.",
        "Most consumer-grade RC cars are outfitted with cheap brass bushings that turn the wheel on the axle.",
        "These bushings aren\u2019t designed for high-output performance, and can slow your car down drastically.",
        "The ball bearings are able to spin more freely than bushings.",
        "This eliminates drag, which can reduce engine strain, and increase battery life.",
        "Switch out the wheels.",
        "While you\u2019ve got the wheels off, consider trading them out for a new-and-improved set.",
        "Select wheels with a tread that\u2019s suited to your preferred racing style.",
        "That way, you can be sure that they\u2019ll hold up under the most demanding conditions and make the most of the speed offered by your car\u2019s other modifications.",
        "Full spikes will offer more traction on uneven surfaces like mud and damp grass.",
        "Mini pins perform well on carpet, turf, and other uneven terrain.",
        "Bald, slick treads and softer tire types are the best choice for hard, smooth paths like paved roads.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for a good all-around tread, try mini spikes.",
        "They strike a balance between speed, grip, and maneuverability.",
        "Remove excess weight.",
        "Consider swapping out the stock frame of your RC car with a lightweight alternative such as aluminum or graphite.",
        "These materials will reduce the pressure on the wheels, which means they won't slow down the car as much as dense plastic and heavier metal pieces.",
        "Keep in mind that the lighter your car is, the less traction you'll have when changing direction.",
        "If you're skilled with a rotary tool, use it to cut off unnecessary plastic sections of the chassis and surrounding body, like the bulky area around the battery socket or the speed control tray.",
        "Trimming the majority of the bulk from the front end of the car can also help make it more aerodynamic (and also make it less likely to flip over when stopping at high speeds)."
