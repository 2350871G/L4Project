The ratio is also crucial\u2014too much hardener will cause the mixture to gel too quickly, and too little may keep the mixture from hardening at all. Finding the right ratio takes experience, but you can get close by estimating that each inch of raw filler diameter requires an inch-length of hardener. For example, if you use an amount of Bondo with a 3 inches (7.6 cm) diameter, you would mix it with a 3 inches (7.6 cm) line of hardener. If you\u2019re struggling with finding the right ratio, look at the product instructions or ask a professional for assistance."
