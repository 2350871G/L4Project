You have just created your first 2 petals. Make 3 more petals using the same technique. You will end up with four V-shapes. You can always make more, but it is easier to work on one flower at a time.

Wrap a thin wire around the center to hold the petals together.Thread the wire through the bottom, pointed part of each V. Start by threading the petals that are directly opposite each other first.

Each time you bring the wire back over the top/front of the flower, thread an 8-millimeter bead onto it. Wooden beads will give you a nice, rustic touch, but you can also use pearls or gold beads for a fancier touch! Make more poinsettias in a similar manner, joining them as you work.

Keep making chenille poinsettias until your garland is as long as you'd like. Hang the garland up. Push a thumbtack or pushpin through the pinched part of one of the petals at each end of the garland. You might be able to use tape, but the garland is more likely to fall down. Making a Paper Poinsettia Garland Cut red scrapbooking paper into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide strips along the shorter edge of the paper.

This is your flower base. Keep the stapler on the table and put your weight on it while stapling. This will make it easier. Cut green scrapbooking paper into 1-inch (2.540centimeter) wide strips. Cut the paper along the short edge of the paper for both sizes (small and large) of flower. This will make the leaves and the connectors for your garland. Staple a green strip between the first and last strips on your flower base. Take your flower base, and fold the first and last strips together. Slip a green strip between them, then staple the three strips together, as close to the base as you can. Do not staple through both layer of the red strips. When you fold them together, they will make an oval-shaped loop. Slip your stapler into the loop before stapling. Staple the base of the red strips together. Your flower base should start looking a little more like a poinsettia by now. It will have several petal-shaped loops. Insert your stapler into each loop, then staple two strips together, as close to the base as you can. Use a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) circle hole punch to make the centers for the flower. You can use yellow, gold, or even glittery scrapbooking paper for this. If you are making larger flowers, use a 1\u00bd-inch (3.81-centimeter) circle hole punch instead. Hot glue the circles to the flower. Draw a swirl of hot glue on the back of your first circle, and press it against the center of your flower. Flip the flower over, and glue the other circle to the back. Make sure that the circles align as best you can. Continue making more paper poinsettias, joining them as you work. Whenever  ever you join the first and last red strips together, insert the green strip from the previous flower between them. Insert a new green strip three petals over. Hang the garland using thumbtacks, pushpins, or tape. You will need to twist the ends of the green strips so that they can lay flat against your wall or window. Do not hang this garland above a mantle. Making a Felt Poinsettia Garland Draw your templates on a sheet of cardstock or thin cardboard, then cut them out. Start by drawing two flower shapes, one smaller than the other one. Each flower shape needs to have five pointed petals (instead of rounded ones). This will create your poinsettia. Trace the templates onto  a sheet of felt. Consider using two different shades of red to give your flowers more depth. For example, you could use a bright red for the bigger flower shape, and a darker red for the smaller flower shape. For a rustic touch, add a blanket stitch around the edges of the petals using embroidery thread. Choose a different shade of red so that it stands out, but does not contrast. Attach the smaller flower shape to the larger one, making the petals off-set. The points of the smaller petals should be between the larger petals; don't stack the two shapes right on top of each other. You can attach the two flowers with a few simple stitches, or with a drop of hot glue. Add the stamen. You can get really creative here. For something rustic, you could sew on a wooden button to the center of the flower. For something more classic, you could sew on five to six small, gold beads. You could also make five to six dots using gold glitter glue. Make more flowers using a similar technique. You can make all red poinsettias, or you could add some white ones too. How many flowers you make is up to you. Cut a long piece of cord. The cord needs to be about 12 inches (12.48 centimeters) wider than the window or doorway you plan on hanging the garland in. This will give the garland a nice drape; it will also leave enough cord on either end so that you can hang the garland. Hot glue the flowers to the cord. Turn the flowers over, and space them however far apart you want them to be. Working one flower at a time, draw a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) line of hot glue on the back of your first flower, then press the cord into it. Move onto the next flower, and repeat the process. Keep gluing the flowers to the cord until there are none left. Leave a few inches at the beginning and end of your cord so that you can hang the garland. Tie small loops to each end of your cord, then hang it up. You can use small wall hooks or thumbtacks to hang the garland.",
