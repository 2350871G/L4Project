Remove the skin or scales of the fish using a dull knife. Remove the innards of the fish, and rinse the body inside and out thoroughly. You only need to clean the fish if you have purchased or caught a whole fish. If possible, ask your local fishmonger to fillet the fish, or slice it into thin strips for you.

A pantry is an ideal location to store the dried fish. If you want to increase the shelf life of the dried fish pieces, place the pieces into the freezer for up to 6 months. Choosing Fish to Dry Choose fish that is fresh with bright and shiny skin. Check that the eyes are clear and not cloudy, as this indicates that the fish has been freshly caught. There shouldn't be an overly fishy smell. Avoid fish that have dull, dry, or loose scales. Avoid choosing fatty fish as it will spoil faster. Fish that is low in fat will keep for longer when dried. Try cod, flounder, snapper, or sole. Fatty types of fish include catfish, salmon, and shark. Any type of fish can be dried, however the lighter it is, the longer it will last. Dry the fish as quickly as possible. When you catch or purchase fresh fish, start the drying process as soon as possible to keep it fresh. This will avoid spoilage, and the dried fish will taste better. Don't dry frozen fish, as the quality of the dried product won't be as good.",
