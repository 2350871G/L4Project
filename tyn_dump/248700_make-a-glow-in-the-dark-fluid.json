You can vary the amount of water, but that will effect how strong your water glows. More water will dilute the glow, and less water may make it shine more intensely. Put on rubber or latex gloves and remove the felt ink tube from a yellow highlighter.

When the ink tube is whitish, it means most or all of the ink is now in the water. Turn on a blacklight and light up your bottles. The water will only glow in the presence of a UV light. Blacklights and blacklight bulbs can be found at party stores, lighting stores, or online. Using Tonic Water and Jell-O for Glowing Baked Goods Prepare your baked goods and chill until firm. If you want to use the glaze on a cake, you'll need to bake, assemble, and frost the cake. Same goes for cupcakes. If you want to glaze cookies, follow your recipe and allow them to cool before attempting to glaze. If you are using the glaze on frosting, it is important the frosting is cold and firm to the touch. The glaze can soften or make the frosting watery if it is not hard. Pour one 3-ounce package of Jell-O to a bowl and add one cup boiling water. Though you can experiment with other flavors and colors, green (lime) Jell-O is the most effective and will give off the strongest glow. Whisk the powder for about one minute, or until thoroughly combined with the boiling water. Add 1 cup chilled tonic water and continue mixing.

Most people choose a B Vitamin complex that contains a lot of thiamine and different B Vitamins. (Look for something called Vitamin B 50 complex or something similar).

Stir the powder until it is mostly dissolved in the water. While this is a safe solution, you definitely don't want to drink any of this water. Add the cup of vitamin water to a warm bath, using a blacklight to make your bath glow. The fluorescent molecules in the vitamin won't glow in the dark, but they will glow in the presence of a blacklight. Use extreme caution when using a blacklight around water. Keep the light a safe distance from the water so there is no possibility that it might fall in. Using Fluorescent Paint for Multi-Colored Glowing Water Purchase glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent paint from a craft store. If you want water that glows in different colors (instead of the yellow that is produced by almost all other methods), buy paint in different shades. Try blue, red, and yellow, which you can mix up to create more shades. Glow-in-the-dark paints will glow without the presence of a blacklight--they can be charged by exposure to regular light.

Set up containers for your different colors, filling each container with hot water. Using clear glasses or bottles will allow your glowing fluid to be bright and visible. Using hot water will dilute the paint faster, so you will see faster results. Add a dollop of paint to the water and stir. There's not a precise measurement for the paint--just add a little and, if you need more, mix in another few drops. Stir the paint vigorously until it mixes into the water. Turn out the lights and turn on a blacklight if you are using fluorescent paints. If you are using glow-in-the-dark paint, check the instructions on how to \"charge\" them so they glow.
