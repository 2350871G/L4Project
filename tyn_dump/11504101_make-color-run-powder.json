Once it's all combined, you should have a thick paste that drips slowly when you lift the spoon out of the bowl. Cornstarch may be labeled as cornflour in some places, including the UK. If you don't have cornstarch or cornflour, you can substitute rice flour, which you can find at many Asian markets if your local grocery store doesn't carry it."

                    "description": "Since you want the colorful powder to have a vibrant shade, plan to use a whole bottle of icing dye for each batch you make. Squeeze in the entire bottle, then stir everything until it's fully combined. You may want to put on gloves to protect your hands from the rich dye. Icing dye is a liquid gel that's thicker and more concentrated than traditional food coloring. If you want to create your own custom-colored powder, try mixing different dyes together, as long as they add up to 1  fl oz (30 mL). For instance, you could mix 1/3 of a bottle of green dye and 2/3 of a bottle of blue dye to make a pretty teal shade."
