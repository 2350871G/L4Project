        "Follow the specific setup instructions for your chosen model.",
        "Use a heating element to maintain the right temperature for your crab species.",
        "Pet crabs are finicky about air temperature, so it\u2019s best to install a heating element that ensures a consistent tank temperature.",
        "Use, for example, a temperature-controlled heat lamp or aquarium heating pad that goes on the side or bottom of the tank.",
        "Fiddler crabs require a temperature range of 75\u201386 \u00b0F (24\u201330 \u00b0C)\nHalloween and rainbow land crabs require a temperature range of 68\u201377 \u00b0F (20\u201325 \u00b0C) Feeding and Entertaining the Crabs Feed the crabs a wide-ranging diet once per day.",
        "Crabs are true omnivores that will eat practically anything.",
        "Scatter the food over the dry sand once per day.",
        "If all the food is gone in less than an hour, start providing more; if the food is still there after 2-3 hours, start providing less.",
        "Try offering crab claw-sized bits of foods like the following:\nFrozen shrimp and plankton from the pet supply store.",
        "Dry or fresh seaweed.",
        "Lettuce, zucchini, apples, and potatoes.",
        "Raw fish.",
        "Hermit crab food pellets.",
        "Fish food flakes.",
        "Dry dog or cat food.",
        "Let the crabs nibble on molted shells or cuttlefish bones for calcium.",
        "Crabs shed their exoskeletons (shells) about every 8 weeks and grow a replacement\u2014this process is called molting.",
        "The molted exoskeleton is a great source of calcium, so leave it in the tank for 1-2 weeks and let the crabs nibble on it if they want.",
        "During times when there are no molted exoskeletons in the tank, add some cuttlefish bones, which are available at pet supply stores.",
        "Add plastic plants, toys, and objects to the tank to entertain the crabs.",
        "While live plants may look nice in the \u201ccrabitat,\u201d crabs are omnivores and tend to kill off live plants fairly quickly.",
        "Instead, use aquarium-safe artificial plants and other objects of interest to decorate the tank.",
        "Crabs don\u2019t need hiding spaces, since they dig into the sand to conceal themselves.",
        "They also don\u2019t need specific toys to occupy them.",
        "Just try different items and see which seem to appeal to the crabs.Warning: Don\u2019t try to get the crabs out to play with them.",
        "Entertain yourself simply by watching them!",
        "Maintaining the Crabitat Test the water salinity (if applicable) and pH at least once per week.",
        "Use your hydrometer to confirm that the water is still at roughly 25% salinity (or 1.02 specific gravity).",
        "Use a pH testing kit (either digital or chemical, both available at pet supply stores) to check the acidity of the water.",
        "For saltwater crabs, the pH should be between 8.0 and 8.3; for freshwater crabs, it should be between 6.5 and 7.5.",
        "Add a bit more water or marine salt to adjust the salinity, if needed.",
        "Add about 0.25 tsp (1.25 g) of baking soda per 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water to increase the pH, if necessary.",
        "Replace half the water monthly (with filter) or all of it weekly (no filter).",
        "If your tank has a filter, remove 50% of the water once per month or 25% of it twice per month.",
        "Do this by using a ladle or large syringe to remove the water, then add water that is at the tank\u2019s temperature and that has been prepared (for salinity, pH, etc.)",
        "according to the needs of the crabs in the tank.",
        "Tip: If your tank does not have a filter, remove as much of the water as you can with a ladle and large syringe, then replace it with properly prepared water.",
        "Do this once per week.",
        "Clean the substrate surface with a kitty litter scoop every week.",
        "Skim the sandy surface with the scoop so that you pick up the very top layer of sand and any feces or food waste present.",
        "Shake the scoop lightly so that the sand falls through the slits or holes, then discard the waste.",
        "Clean the sand more frequently if the tank tends to develop an unpleasant odor during the week.",
        "Empty, clean, and refill the tank completely 3 times per year.",
        "Move the crabs to individual containers that they can\u2019t escape from, like high-sided plastic storage containers without lids.",
        "Return them to the tank as soon as you complete all of the following cleaning measures:\nRemove all plastic plants, toys, etc., wipe them down with a rag soaked in a 3% bleach solution (available at pet supply stores), rinse them with clean water, and dry them with a clean towel.",
        "Remove and discard all the water and sand in the tank.",
        "Clean all the interior surfaces of the tank with the 3% bleach solution, rinse them thoroughly with clean water, and dry them completely with clean towels.",
        "Prepare the tank as you did for the original setup, using new sand and properly-prepared water.",
        "Make sure the water and the tank interior are within the appropriate temperature range."
