Your dog may chew on a foam board, and foam boards have no traction, so they use wax, which is terrible for a dog's paws as sand and debris get in the webs of your dog's paws and could be harmful. Make sure you get a \"dog surfboard\". The hard surface dog surfboards are great and come with many safety features such as a standard ocean rescue safety release handle on the tail for choosing the right waves or hanging on for the ride. They also come with Soft Traction throughout the board, which provides not just traction but also serves as a cushion in case of a wipe out! The hard Dog Surfboards, are great because you can design your own colors, logo's, pics of dog or any artwork you can think of! They are totally customized for your dog, which you can't get with any soft board. Harder top boards float much better and do not fold or bend nor crease. Soft boards  are a little less stable and slippery which causes the dog to move forward on the board thus causing the surfboard to nose dive."

If your dog is too far forward, the board will nosedive under the wave, unless you use a hard top dog surfboard with traction such as \"Scrappy\" below in the picture.
