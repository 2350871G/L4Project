When this happens, the first thing you\u2019re likely to notice is dense, black smoke accompanied by a distinct burning odor. The battery itself will then ignite, often emitting small white flames or a faint reddish glow. You may also hear a loud popping or sizzling sound as the chemical-infused metals in the battery continue to burn. When a phone catches fire, it can cause the surrounding materials to bubble, melt or even explode, making it very unsafe to be around.
