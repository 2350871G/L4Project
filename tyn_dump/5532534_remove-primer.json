Most primers are oil-based, so plain water won't be effective against them. As oil-based products, though, they are oil-soluble and can usually be lifted with the use of additional oil. A little will go a long way, so you may only need 1 to 3 Tbsp (15 to 45 ml), even when you need to remove a large primer spot. Vegetable oil isn't your only option, either. Most cooking oil will work just as well. Try using coconut oil, olive oil, or canola oil if all-purpose vegetable oil isn't available."

This step is not strictly necessary, and you should be able to remove primer from your skin with only vegetable oil and no essential oil.

        "Scrub with a wire brush.",
        "After letting the pain stripper soak, scrub the soaked area of the stain with a long-handled wire brush.",
        "Ideally, you should scrub while standing rather than crouching since you can apply a greater amount of pressure that way.",
        "Scrub from different angles so that you can work on the stain as thoroughly as possible.",
        "Rinse with a pressure washer.",
        "Rinse away the paint stripper and primer residue with a moderate-pressure washer hose.",
        "Do this while the paint stripper is still wet.",
        "Do not wait for it to dry since any primer residue it picked up will have a chance to set again if you do.",
        "The pressure from the washer hose should scrape away even more of the primer, but a moderate pressure is still recommended over a high pressure.",
        "High pressure can actually cause the cement to wear away, causing more harm than good as a result.",
        "Work around the entire spill area.",
        "Repeat this process around the entire spill area, working in 1-foot (30.5-cm) patches.",
        "Apply the paint stripper.",
        "Scrub the paint stripper into the stain.",
        "Rinse the paint stripper and primer away with a pressure washer.",
        "Rinse well.",
        "When you think you've covered the entire spill area, rinse it down using light pressure from a pressure hose.",
        "Inspect the area while it is wet, then again after it has dried.",
        "If some of the stain still remains, you can use the same process to try removing it."
