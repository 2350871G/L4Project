Use shaving cream or soap - never try to shave without shaving cream or soap, as it can lead to irritation, nicks, and little red bumps, which you don't want.

If you're interested in looking after the appearance of the skin on your face beyond hygiene you can:\nUse a cleanser recommended for your skin type. Put a small amount of face cleanser on your hands, about the size of a nickel, and rub some on your wet hands. Use a product that is gentle enough for your skin, because something that's too strong will just dry the skin out and stimulate the oil glands to produce more oil - you're trying to remove oil and retain moisture at the same time. Do not use soap - it's too strong, and can't be rinsed easily. Using your fingertips, massage the cleanser all over your face, removing any dirt and oil. Take thirty seconds or so, concentrating on first the hairline, then paying special attention to the \"T-zone\" (forehead, nose, and nostril area), then around the mouth and chin, then cheeks. Cleanse the neck using upward strokes. You have oil glands behind your ears, so don't neglect that area. It's messy, but do it anyway. When you're fifty, you will be glad you went to the trouble to help your mature skin look its best. Rinse your face with warm water and pat it dry with a soft towel. Moisturizer is a very good thing. You have just washed off dirt and oil, and a moisturizer will help keep the moisture in the surface cells, which promotes a more youthful looking complexion - plus it feels great."
