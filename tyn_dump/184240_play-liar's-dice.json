Whoever has the highest combined total between the 2 dice will start. Traditionally, you\u2019ll go clockwise around the table, meaning that the person on the starting player\u2019s immediate left will go second. Hand each player 5 dice along with a dice cup. They'll use the dice cup to shake the 5 dice and roll them at the beginning of each round. If you don't have a dice cup, you can use an opaque drinking cup. Another alternative is to simply roll the dice with your hand. Have everyone roll their 5 dice at the same time, keeping them hidden. While you can (and should) look at your own dice, you should make sure no one else can see yours. You can do this by flipping the dice cup on top of your dice and lifting it so that only you can see the dice. If anyone sees someone else\u2019s dice, have everyone roll again. Let the first player guess how many total of one dice face were rolled. This is the total between all the dice on the table. They\u2019ll make a bet out loud that includes a dice face along with the quantity they believe were rolled by the other players. For example, they might say \u201c7 3\u2019s\u201d which means they think there are 7 dice on the table with a \u201c3\u201d face up. Allow the other players to challenge the bet or make a new one.

Individual Hand Liar\u2019s Dice with 2 Players Figure out who will start the game by each rolling 5 dice. The player with the largest sum of dice will begin the first round. Note that this variation of liar\u2019s dice only takes 2 players. For example, if one person rolls a 22 and other rolls an 18, the person who rolled the 22 will start.

They can roll however many they\u2019d like. For example, they can keep 3 of the dice the way you rolled them and just reroll 2 if they want. Regardless of the number of dice they choose to roll, they should keep them hidden from you. The player cannot lie about how many dice are being rolled, however.
