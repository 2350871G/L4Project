If you want to keep more crappie, choose a larger tank. While an aquarium cover isn\u2019t necessary as the crappie cannot jump out, it will help to prevent the water from evaporating out of the aquarium. Spread a 2 in (5.1 cm) thick base of dark substrate in the aquarium. Choose dark, neutral-toned aquarium gravel or sand. Pour the gravel or sand directly into the tank.
