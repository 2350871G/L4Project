Use a pencil and ruler to mark the board. Use a pencil rather than a pen as this can easily be erased. Mark which side of the corner the skirting board is on. This is an important step if you want your corners to fit together. If your skirting board sits to the left of the corner, draw an arrow on the wood pointing towards the left.

A mitre box is a tool that will help you to make the cuts at the correct angles. In order for the box to be stable, it needs to be attached to something.

Push one board right into the corner and then push the second board to the corner so that the end is flat against the first skirting board.
