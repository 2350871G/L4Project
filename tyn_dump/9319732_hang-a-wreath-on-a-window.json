        "Coat the end of your ribbon with hot glue and place it against the back of your wreath.",
        "Make sure that the end of the ribbon is pointing towards the top/outer edge of the wreath, and that the rest of the ribbon is pointing towards the center.",
        "If you don't have hot glue, you can use a U-shaped florist's pin instead.",
        "Wrap the ribbon around the top of the wreath twice.",
        "Thread the ribbon through the middle of the wreath.",
        "Pull it up across the front and over the top.",
        "Do this step twice, stopping when you reach the top again.",
        "You can secure the ribbon to the front of the wreath with another drop of hot glue for additional security.",
        "Add a bow to the top of the wreath for a nicer finish, if desired.",
        "If you have any ribbon leftover on the spool, you can tie it into a fancy bow, then hot glue it to the front of the wreath, right over the wrapped ribbon.",
        "You can also buy a pre-made matching bow from the store, and use that instead.",
        "The ribbon and floral departments of arts and crafts stores often sell pre-made bows.",
        "Alternatively, you can place the bow at the bottom of the wreath.",
        "Open the window and push the wreath through it.",
        "You only need to open the window wide enough to fit the wreath through\u2014about 1 foot (30 cm) will be enough for most wreaths.",
        "Be sure to hold onto the ribbon tightly so that you don't drop the wreath.",
        "You are hanging the wreath on the outside of the window.",
        "If you want the wreath to be on the inside, you will need to get out a ladder, and work from the outside of your home.",
        "Adjust the length of the ribbon, then pin it to the window frame.",
        "Pull down on the ribbon until the wreath is hanging where you want it to be.",
        "Push a thumbtack or pushpin through the ribbon and into the frame.",
        "Make sure that you stick the pin to the side of the frame.",
        "If you pin it to the very top, it will get in the way when you close the window.",
        "If you have vinyl or metal window frames, tie a large knot into the ribbon instead.",
        "Close the window.",
        "This will help give the ribbon extra security and prevent it from slipping or sliding.",
        "Keep the window closed as long as the wreath is up.",
        "Even if you pinned the wreath, there is a small chance that it may come loose.",
        "If you tied a knot onto your ribbon, make sure that it is on the inside of the window, otherwise the wreath will fall."
