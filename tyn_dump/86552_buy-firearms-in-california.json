        "Some purchases require extra documents, as described in the eligibility section above.",
        "In California, you are only allowed to purchase one handgun within a 30-day period.",
        "There is no time limit for long guns, or for antique guns if you have a collector's license.",
        "Perform the safe handling demonstration.",
        "A DOJ Certified Instructor (typically at the gun store) will walk you through safe handling instructions, and sign a statement saying you completed them.",
        "You are not required to do this until you pick up the firearm.",
        "However, the state of California recommends you do this before you finalize the sale, to make sure you know how to use the firearm.",
        "Pay state and dealer fees.",
        "Each transaction (for any number of firearms) costs you $25 in DROS (Dealer Record of Sales) and related state fees.",
        "If you are buying directly from a firearm dealer, ask them if they have any extra fees now before you place the order.",
        "If you are buying from another private party, the gun dealer overseeing the purchase is only allowed to charge $10 per firearm, plus the state fees.",
        "Wait ten days.",
        "In almost all cases, you are required to wait ten days before picking up the firearm (exactly 240 hours after submitting the DROS).",
        "During this time your DROS information is being sent to the CA DMV, CA DOJ, and then on to the FBI NICS.",
        "Each of these organizations has an opportunity to deny your application, or to delay it if they need more time to investigate.",
        "The dealer must give you a copy of your DROS information upon request, proving that you were denied or accepted.",
        "The dealer is legally required to cancel the sale if you do not show up within 30 days of submitting the DROS.",
        "Purchase a safe while you wait.",
        "Now is a good time to purchase a California-approved firearms safe (or locking device).",
        "Safes are a good way to be able to store your firearms, and store them safely, where they won't get stolen or others (children, friends, etc.)",
        "won't have access.",
        "As required by law in California, you must either own a California-approved gun safe or purchase a new gun lock for each firearm purchased.",
        "Proof is required for each.",
        "Proof of ownership of a gun safe requires either an owners manual or a receipt of purchase.",
        "Proof of Lock ownership requires a receipt of lock within 30 days of actual pick up date (not date of sale).",
        "Most American gun dealers will already include a free original equipment manufacturer (OEM) gun lock that will satisfy this requirement (not all of the free locks are California legal, see your local dealer for more information  or visit the California's Department of Justice website for a complete list of approved locks).",
        "Go pick up your firearm.",
        "If you successfully pass the background check, you can now return to the retail outlet and purchase your gun.",
        "You will sign some papers, saying you are now in possession of the firearm.",
        "You will be required to have (or purchase) a California-approved locking device or prove you own a safe (or sign an affidavit saying you own a safe, but do not have proof).",
        "If you have purchased a pistol, you will need your handgun safety certificate and proof of residency (this can be a recent water or electric bill or even valid vehicle registration).",
        "Appeal a denied application if necessary.",
        "If your DROS application was denied, you will receive a letter within two weeks explaining why.",
        "The letter will include instructions for how to appeal the decision, giving you a second chance to make the purchase."
