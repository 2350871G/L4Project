            "description": "Moscow's climate is dominated by long winters and high snow fall, but the summers are relatively warm. Make sure to bring clothing appropriate to the season in which you will be travelling. Summer temperatures average 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C), or 18 Celsius. If you are travelling to Moscow during this time, bring lighter clothing and light jackets for the evening. It is important to remember that Russian casual wear is slightly more formal than U.S. or western casual clothing. Shorts and a T-shirt could be worn in usual walks, but not in museums, theaters, etc. On the other hand, winters can be brutal in Moscow, with temperatures at 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C) or -6 Celsius. Moscow also experiences heavy snow fall, so when travelling to Moscow during the winter be sure to pack boots, heavy coats, gloves, and scarves and hats. Spring in Moscow is usually cold and wet, so bring umbrellas and keep heavy coats and gloves on hand just in case. Fall clothing is much the same. If you are visiting closer to December, bring heavier coats and clothing."
