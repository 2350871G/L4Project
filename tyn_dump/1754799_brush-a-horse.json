The horse should still be able to move its head and body, but will be tethered to the stall. Alternatively, you can use \u201cquick-release\u201d snaps attached to cross-ties to make sure the horse stays in place but can break away if necessary. You can brush the horse outside of the stall as long as it\u2019s comfortable and secured in one place. If the horse isn't secure, it can potentially run away in the middle of your grooming session. A good place to secure a horse outside of their stall is in the aisle or in a wash rack. Both areas have cross ties to keep your horse still."

Pet it a few times and talk in a calm and soothing voice to let it know that you can be trusted. Sudden movements can cause the horse to kick and fidget. Always be aware of where your body is in relation to the horse. Horses sometimes stomp their feet when a new person approaches. Don\u2019t be alarmed! They\u2019re just communicating with you."

When you\u2019re first working with a new horse, wear a helmet to prevent accidents from kicking or bucking. In the stall, wear jeans and boots to protect your feet and legs from being stepped on or cut by sharp objects. You can wear a short-sleeved or long-sleeved shirt while grooming, but a long-sleeved shirt will provide more protection and keep you cleaner. Wearing gloves can protect you from painful hair splinters, but may make grooming more difficult because it's harder to move your hands."
