Similarly, if the junction box will be exposed to fumes, such as in a paint shop, choose a junction box formulated for that type of usage. To find the right size junction box in cubic inches, count the number of wires entering the junction box. Multiply the total by 2 when working with 14-gauge wire or by 2.25 when working with 12-gauge wire. Then, select the largest ground wire and add 2 if it is a 14-gauge wire to 2.25 if it is a 12-gauge wire. Choose a junction box with conductor fill volume (which is the number of conductors allowed in a junction box) higher or equal to the number of wires (after multiplying them by 2 and adding in the ground wire) entering the junction box. It\u2019s best to choose a fill volume higher than the number of wires you have to ensure there will be enough room. Stuffing a junction box with wires can lead to fires. All of the wires should have plenty of space to fit cleanly inside the box. When in doubt, always go with a bigger size."
