A good rule of thumb is 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hermit crab per 1 gallon (3.8 l). To determine how long your crabs are, measure across the shell opening. Remember, the habitat (or as many people call it, \"crabitat\") needs to be able to hold 3 dishes, climbing toys, shelters, shells, and have space for the crabs to walk around. A 10 US gal (38 l) tank usually does nicely for a maximum of 3 small hermit crabs. You may want to consider starting off with at least a 30 US gal (110 l) tank. A larger tank will allow more climbing toys and more space. Hermit crabs, when cared for properly, can live for decades and grow very slowly to the size of a baseball. The tank size will need to increase as the hermit crabs grow."

Medium crabs (golf ball size) need at least 8 inches (20 cm) of substrate for molting. Small crabs (quarter size) need 6 inches (15 cm). Tiny crabs (often called \"micros\", the size of a dime) need 4 inches (10 cm) of substrate. Examine the substrate carefully before putting it in the crabitat.

You should be able to make a hole in it easily, but not get your fingers wet. Puddles of water or muddy substrate means you are misting too much.

These are small pads that stick to the outside glass of the enclosure and usually raise the temperature up between 4 and 6 degrees. Try placing the unit on the bottom of the tank. Even with a thick layer of substrate the UTH will be effective. Heat lights work great on larger enclosures and can usually heat the tank to any temperature. A 40 watt light will do nicely on a 10 US gal (38 L) tank. Heat lights do dry out the tank very quickly, however, so you may have to spray the inside of the tank more often. Make sure that the heat source is placed on one side of the tank, and not in the middle. This is so the tank has a warm and cool side so the crabs can be around whatever temperature they prefer."

It's a lot easier to have a batch of water ready to use for the next few weeks or so rather than having to make a small amount every day.

If you have very large and very small crabs living together, put pebbles at the bottom of the large crab\u2019s water dish so a small crab can have a way to get out of it if it falls in by accident. Always make sure there is a way for the crabs to climb out of the dishes. Put a little bit of sponge, shells, or pebbles in the dish. You can also make your own fresh, dechlorinated saltwater. Make 1 US gal (3.8 l) of dechlorinated water using your water conditioner. Add 10 tbsp (170 g) of aquarium salt. Let the water sit overnight so the salt dissolves. Do not use table salt to make the salt water. It contains harmful iodine. Many crabs also drink salt water prior to molting.

Pieces of wood, Lego structures, cork bark, fake or live plants, rocks, large coral, barnacle clusters, and fish d\u00e9cor all make great climbing structures. Avoid using evergreen wood in the crabitat, as it annoys the hermit crabs. Try creating a second level to the crabitat by using a shower caddy stuck to the glass walls of the tank. Fill it with moss or coconut fibre. Add a branch to act as a ladder for the crabs to climb up.

In captivity, you need to ensure that there is a wide variety of shells to choose from. You can tell if a hermit crab's shell fits if it can seal the opening of the shell with its large claw and armor leg (back left). As a general rule, land hermit crabs prefer shells with round openings. You can get inexpensive shells from craft stores. Another great place is online. Boil the shells for 20 minutes & drain them before putting them in the crabitat. If its legs stick out a bit and you can still see its eyes, the hermit crab will be on the market for a new shell. Simply drop some shells in the tank and the hermit crab will change when ready. You can dip the shells in salt water periodically to draw the crabs\u2019 attention to them if you wish."

Then, take it out of the bath and put it in a safe, enclosed space to dry. Once it\u2019s fully dry, you can put it into the crabitat with the others. Try to get your hermit crab to walk down your arm or hand and get into the water himself. If that doesn\u2019t work, gently lift him by the shell and lower him into the bath. Always supervise a bathing crab.

Feed your hermit crabs at the same time every evening, and then take away any uneaten food the next morning. You can keep dry food in the crabitat for 2 days, but be sure to remove any fresh food daily. Hermit crabs eat very little and in small amounts. To put it in perspective, most hermit crabs take a few hours to eat half a cheerio. So don't think that your hermit crabs are starving, because they aren't! Hand-feed your hermit crab to increase your bond. To do this, take a small piece of your crab\u2019s favorite food in one hand. Gently pick up the crab by its shell with your other hand and place it on your hand next to the food. Wait patiently until your crab gathers the courage to reach out for it. Your crab may start by doing a \u201ctaste test\u201d of the food. It will put an antenna on the food, and then stick the antenna into its mouth. If your crab is interested in eating, it will pinch off small bits of food with its claw and then put it in its mouth. If your crab isn\u2019t hungry, it may pinch the food but not eat any of it. In this case, put it down and try again later. Keeping the Crabs Healthy and Entertained Add shells to the crabitat so the crabs can upgrade their housing as necessary. Hermit crabs do not grow their own shell. They take them from dead gastropods like snails. In captivity, you need to ensure that there is a wide variety of shells to choose from. You can tell if a hermit crab's shell fits if it can seal the opening of the shell with its large claw and armor leg (back left). As a general rule, land hermit crabs prefer shells with round openings. You can get inexpensive shells from craft stores. Another great place is online. Boil the shells for 20 minutes & drain them before putting them in the crabitat. If its legs stick out a bit and you can still see its eyes, the hermit crab will be on the market for a new shell. Simply drop some shells in the tank and the hermit crab will change when ready. You can dip the shells in salt water periodically to draw the crabs\u2019 attention to them if you wish. Clean the crabitat often. A clean tank will keep your crabs healthy and happy. Use a kitchen strainer or fish net to strain the sand at least 3 times per week to remove crap poop, exoskeletons, and buried food. Wash the dishes with a damp paper towel every few days. Rearrange their climbing toys every few weeks to give the crabitat a new look and keep the crabs interested in them. You should replace all the substrate every 6 months. Every month, take all the shells and dishes out of the crabitat and boil them in dechlorinated saltwater to kill any mold or bacteria. Bathe new hermit crabs and recently molted crabs. Although you can generally let the crabs bathe whenever they feel like it, if you are introducing a new crab to the crabitat, or one of your crabs has just emerged from molting, you should give it a quick bath. Pour some tepid, dechlorinated saltwater into a shallow dish and place your hermit crab in the water. Let it sit fully immersed in the water for about 1 minute. Then, take it out of the bath and put it in a safe, enclosed space to dry. Once it\u2019s fully dry, you can put it into the crabitat with the others. Try to get your hermit crab to walk down your arm or hand and get into the water himself. If that doesn\u2019t work, gently lift him by the shell and lower him into the bath. Always supervise a bathing crab. It can get really active after bathing, so even if it\u2019s sitting at the bottom of the water at one moment, it might be scurrying out and getting lost in your house in the blink of an eye. Your drying off area can be as simple as a cardboard box lined with paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. Keep handling to a minimum. Avoid touching or handling your hermit crabs as much as possible. It can stress them out or even cause injury if you touch a molting crab. If you must pick them up or handle them, always grab them gently by the shell. Even if your hermit crab knows and likes you, it may still pinch you if it becomes frightened. Be sure to handle the crab gently and carefully. Consult a veterinarian if you see signs that your crab is sick. Hermit crabs don\u2019t get sick very often. However, if you notice signs of sickness, like dry skin, or if your crabs are acting especially lethargic, they may be sick. Start by isolating the sick crabs and cleaning the whole tank. If that doesn\u2019t solve the problem, consult with a veterinarian. The trip to the veterinarian may be quite stressful for the crabs, so be sure to only take them only if absolutely necessary.",
