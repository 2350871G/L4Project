Use a medium grit sandpaper (60 - 100 rating) to remove burrs, splinters, and rough patches in the wood. Sand until the wood is completely even and smooth. After you are finished sanding, take a rag dampened with water and wipe away any dust or sawdust, then allow the wood to dry completely.

        "Apply it in short, smooth, horizontal strokes.",

        "Adding Personal Touches Avoid deforming the top surface of the board.",

        "Both teams using the same equipment prevents one team from having an unfair advantage over another.",

        "Attach handles for easier board transportation.",
        "Official Cornhole boards are 2 by 4 feet (0.61 by 1.22 m).",

        "Attach less flexible ornaments, like rhinestones, with glue.",
        "String lights on the sides of your goal board.",
        "This is a great way to keep your Cornhole game going late into the evening.",
        "With a string of lights hanging on the sides of your goal board, players will be able to find them easily, though mis-thrown bean bags might prove a challenge.",
        "You can use U-shaped tacks and a hammer to fasten your lights to the sides of your board.",
        "In many cases, like when tailgating or playing in the backyard, you may not have an electrical outlet available.",
