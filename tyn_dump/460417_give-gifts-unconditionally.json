Look instead for the things they'd never consider purchasing - like the red shoes with really high heels you overheard them pondering about but muttered that they couldn't afford, a trip to a spa resort that they would never think to slow down for normally, or a new food that is something they've never tried before etc."

Otherwise, if you must produce such items as gifts, gift them to the house, the car, or the family as a whole.
