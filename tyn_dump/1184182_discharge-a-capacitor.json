This usually means unplugging the electronic device from the wall outlet or disconnecting the battery in your car. In a car, locate your battery in the engine bay or trunk, then loosen the nuts holding the cables on the negative (-) and positive (+) terminals using an open-ended wrench or socket with a ratchet. Slide the cable off of the terminal to disconnect it. Wrap the end of each cable with a rag so they don\u2019t touch anything. In your house, you can usually unplug the device you\u2019re working on from the wall, but if you are unable to do so, locate the house\u2019s breaker box and flip the switch that controls the flow of electricity to the room you\u2019re working in."

        "Use a pair of insulated pliers to hold smaller capacitors so you don\u2019t accidentally shock yourself while you\u2019re discharging it.",
        "Lay the screwdriver across both terminals.",
        "Hold the capacitor upright with the posts pointed toward the ceiling, then bring the screwdriver over with the other hand and touch it to both posts at once to discharge the capacitor.",
        "You will hear and see the electric discharge in the form of a spark.",
        "Make sure the screwdriver is touching both terminals at once or else it won\u2019t work.",
        "Touch it again to check that it\u2019s discharged.",
        "Before you handle the capacitor freely, pull the screwdriver away and bring it down again onto the two posts to see if it produces any spark.",
        "If you properly discharged it, there should be no additional discharge.",
        "This step is just a safety precaution.",
        "Once you\u2019ve confirmed that the capacitor is discharged, it\u2019s safe to handle.",
        "You can also confirm that it has been discharged using your multimeter if you\u2019d prefer.",
        "Making and Using a Capacitor Discharge Tool Purchase 12 gauge wire, a 20k OHM 5 watt resistor, and 2 alligator clips.",
        "A discharge tool is really just a resistor and a bit of wire to connect it to the posts on the capacitor.",
        "You can purchase all of these parts at your local auto parts or hardware store.",
        "The alligator clips make it much easier to keep the tool connected once it\u2019s completed.",
        "You will also need electric tape or heat shrink wrap and a soldering iron if you don\u2019t already have one.",
        "Cut the wire into two 6 in (15 cm) pieces.",
        "The exact length of the wire isn\u2019t particularly important, as long as there\u2019s enough slack to connect both to the capacitor and the resistor.",
        "For most applications, 6 inches (15 cm) is enough, but you can make yours longer if it helps with your specific situation.",
        "Each wire just needs to be long enough to connect one end of the resistor to one post on the capacitor.",
        "Cutting the pieces a little longer gives you some extra slack to work with and may make things easier.",
        "Clip off about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation on each end of both wires.",
        "Use wire strippers to remove the insulation without damaging the wire inside.",
        "If you don\u2019t have strippers, you can use a knife or razor blade to cut through just the insulation and then use your fingers to pull it off the wire.",
        "Both ends of both wires should show bare metal now.",
        "Make sure to remove enough insulation to solder the stripped ends to other wires or clips.",
        "Solder one end of each wire to the two probes sticking out of the resistor.",
        "The resistor has a wire post sticking out of each end.",
        "Wrap the end of one wire around the first post and then solder it into place.",
        "Then wrap one end of the other wire around the other post and solder it into place.",
        "It should now look like a resistor with long wires sticking out of each end.",
        "Leave the loose ends of each wire free for now.",
        "Wrap the soldered connections in electrical tape or shrink wrap.",
        "Cover the solder using the electrical tape by simply wrapping a piece around it.",
        "This will help hold the connection in place while also insulating it from anything that may come into contact with it.",
        "If you\u2019re making a tool you will likely reuse, slide a tube of electrical heat shrink wrap over the end of the wire and slide it along until it covers the soldered connection.",
        "If you use heat shrink wrap, you can shrink the wrap in place over the connection by exposing it to the flame from a lighter or match.",
        "Do not expose electrical tape to a flame.",
        "Solder the alligator clips to the ends of each wire.",
        "Take the loose end of one of the wires and solder an insulated alligator clip to it, then either heat shrink wrap it or cover it in electrical tape.",
        "Then do the same with the other loose end on the other wire.",
        "If you are going to use heat shrink wrap, remember to slide it over the wire before soldering the clip into place; otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to get it over the head of the clip once it\u2019s permanently affixed to the wire.",
        "Connect one alligator clip to each of the two posts on the capacitor to discharge it.",
        "Clip the end of each wire to a different terminal on the capacitor.",
        "It will discharge very quickly, though you shouldn\u2019t see or hear a spark as you would with a screwdriver.",
        "Be sure each clip has a clean connection with the metal of the post.",
        "Be careful not to touch the posts with your hands while you connect them.",
        "Use a multimeter to make sure the capacitor has discharged.",
        "Once again set the multimeter to its highest voltage rating and touch each lead to a separate post on the capacitor.",
        "If it still shows stored voltage, check the connections on your discharge tool and try again.",
        "You can leave the multimeter connected to the capacitor while you watch the voltage drop in real time.",
        "If the voltage doesn\u2019t drop, one of the connections isn\u2019t right in the discharge tool.",
        "Examine it closely for where one might be broken.",
        "Once all of the connections on the discharge tool are good, try again and it should discharge."
