It uses more wood than the advanced-framing method and has less space between the studs for insulation. The advanced-framing method uses less wood by using studs on 24-inch (60.9 cm) centers and open corners. The advanced-framing method may be considered by some to be structurally inferior; however, it meets the structural codes of most areas.
