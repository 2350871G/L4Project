                    "description": "Bare root plants are most likely to take root if you plant them during the dormant season, which lasts from late fall through early spring. Depending on the plant you want to grow, it's best to purchase your plant between January and April. Try to get your plant in the ground before its buds start to swell. That way, the plant will be able to put all of its energy into the roots. It's best to put your bare root plants in the ground within about 24 hours of bringing them home. If you can't plant them right away, keep them in a cool place with the roots covered and moist. Do not let the roots dry out. You can buy bare root plants from most greenhouse nurseries, or you can purchase them online and have them shipped to you if you want a better selection. Did You Know? Bare root plants are stored in cool, moist without any potting soil around their roots. This can save you a lot of money, since you're not paying for a container and soil."

                    "description": "The plant should be plump and firm, with a healthy-looking root system. Although a few broken twigs are fine, the plant should be mostly intact, and it should be free of mold, mildew, or a rotting smell. Also, the roots should feel slightly heavy, rather than light or dried out. If you purchase your bare root plants in the store, look them over before you bring them home. However, if you order them online, check them out as soon as they arrive to make sure they're suitable for planting. Use garden shears to snip away any branches or roots that appear to be damaged or withered.Wondering how to plant ginger root or other rhizomes? If you have a plant that produces rhizomes, like ginger, turmeric, asparagus, bamboo, or irises, you can use this same technique to grow the plant from even just a small piece of the rhizome, as long as it has growing buds. However, you can also plant the entire rhizome, if you prefer."

The length of time you'll soak the roots depends on the plants\u2014soft perennials might only need to soak for about 20 minutes to soften them, but woodier plants will benefit from soaking for several hours or overnight. As you experiment with how to plant bare root trees, you'll get a better idea for how long to soak each plant. If you're not sure, though, soak the plant for at least 3-4 hours. Do not leave the roots in the water for more than 24 hours or they may begin to rot."

It's important that the hole is deep enough, because you don't want the roots to be bent or clumped up when you put the plant in the ground. In addition, digging the hole so it's about twice as wide as the root system, you'll ensure there's plenty of room for the roots to grow outward.

Avoid taking a cutting that's covered with flower buds, if it's possible. The plant will put energy into these buds that may take away from root growth. Only take cuttings from healthy plants. If the parent plant is diseased, the cutting likely will be as well. Research your plant to discover if cuttings are the best way to propogate them. Some plants are harder to root from a cutting than others. For example, it's possible to learn how to root an aloe plant from a leaf cutting. However, it's much easier to find an offset, or a pup, growing at the base of your plant. These have their own root systems, so you can just transfer them to a new pot."

If you took multiple cuttings from the same branch, take special care to ensure that each cutting is upright, with the buds pointing upward. If the cutting is upside-down, it is unlikely to root. Your rooting medium needs to retain moisture while still providing good drainage. Coarse sand is a good option, but you can also combine equal parts peat and perlite or peat and sand, if you prefer. You can also place the cutting in a clean glass full of water and leave it there until roots develop. This is a good option if you want to keep a close eye on the roots."
