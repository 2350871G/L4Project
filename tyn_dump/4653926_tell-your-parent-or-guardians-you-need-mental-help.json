Should I call an ambulance?\"). Do not panic. This is temporary. Any decent parent or guardian will overcome this and do their best to help you get treatment. You may have to assure them that it's not their fault, they raised you well and it's only coming from chemicals in your brain, you aren't planning on suicide (assuming that this is true), and that you've researched this and understand how to proceed. If you have been considering suicide, explain that you want to live, and this is why you are telling them instead of keeping quiet."
