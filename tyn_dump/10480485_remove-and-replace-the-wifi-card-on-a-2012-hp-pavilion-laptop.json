Remove the laptop battery by sliding the battery tab. Look for an access panel on the bottom. It should be the only section on the bottom of the laptop that has a plate with screws. There may be a symbol by the access panel that appears to be a bunch of stacked disks, along with a WiFi symbol. Remove the screws on the access panel.  Slide the access panel out.  Locate the WiFi adapter. The WiFi adapter should have two thin antenna wires attached to it. Take note of the numbers attached to each antenna wire.  Remove screws with screwdriver that may be holding the WiFi adapter in place.  Pry off the two antenna wire connectors from the WiFi adapter. Pull the WiFi adapter from the slot. Installing the New WiFi Adapter Unbox the new WiFi adapter. Compare the model number to the model number that is on the website or packaging. Slide the adapter into the PCI slot.  Check to make sure the WiFi antennas are facing upwards. If the WiFi adapter does not fit, it was not inserted properly. Attempt to reinstall if the adapter does not fit. Attach the WiFi antennas to the WiFi adapter (using a finger or screwdriver is recommended). Use one of the small screwdrivers to press down on the antennas to make sure that it is fully attached. Reinstall the access panel plate, inserting the tabbed side in first. The tabbed side will be the opposite of where the screw slot is. Reinstall the screws. Make sure that they are installed tightly. Installing the Correct WiFi Drivers Turn on the laptop. Check for proper WiFi signal. Use an ethernet cable if no WiFi signal exists. Navigate to the website of the manufacturer that supplied the wifi adapter (Intel, Atheros, Broadcom).  Locate the driver support page.  Take note of the specific model number. This will make sure that the user gets optimal performance with the new WiFi adapter. Find the download for the specific WiFi adapter.  Download and install the drivers for the WiFi card.
