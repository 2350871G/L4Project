Rotating the Sensor Find a drill bit that fits securely into the VSS. In order to simulate the movement of your vehicle to properly test the sensor, you need to rotate the gear inside of the VSS. Insert drill bits into the gear slot on the VSS until you find one that fits securely into it. Different sensors have differently sized slots, so try out a few bits until you find one that fits your VSS. Connect the bit to your power drill. Loosen the chuck, or the piece on the end of the drill, by rotating it so the jaws open up. Slide the smooth end of the bit into the jaws and then slowly rotate the drill to tighten the jaws around the bit so it\u2019s held securely. Give the bit a gentle tug to make sure it won\u2019t fall out. Spin the gears of the VSS by pulling the trigger on the drill. Hold the VSS in place with your hand and bring the drill up to speed slowly to rotate the gears in the slot the drill bit is inserted into. Allow the VSS to rotate at full speed so you can get an accurate reading. Start slowly and continue to increase the speed of the drill at a consistent pace so you don\u2019t strip or damage the VSS.
