If the pilot hole is too large, the anchor will fall out easily. If it's too small, you may not be able to get the anchor in, or the tight confines could cause it to malfunction. Most drywall anchors have the dimensions clearly labeled on the packaging. Simply note the width of the anchor to determine what size drill bit you need. You want your hole to be slightly smaller than the anchor. When you're installing the anchor, you'll need to lightly tap it into place. If you're unable to find the dimensions of the anchors you're using, you may need to perform a size comparison by holding them up side-by-side with several different bits."

Once you have your pilot hole in place, you can use it to install any type of drywall anchor. If you don\u2019t have an electric drill, you can also make a pilot hole using an awl or hammer and nail-set or nail. As another alternative, you can use a Phillips head screwdriver to make your hole. Press the tip of the screwdriver against the wall, then twist it back and forth to create your hole. Not every type of wall anchor requires a pre-drilled pilot hole, but it\u2019s a helpful first step and can end up saving you time that you might otherwise spend struggling to get an anchor through stubborn drywall by hand."

Your mounted item might not hang correctly if one or more of the holes have been drilled at odd angles. When hanging very heavy items, such as TVs, make sure you screw into at least one wall stud.
