Between the curly braces, type EQ \\o(X1,X2).

Note the space after EQ and before \\o\nFor any special characters (like the macron, or overline, in the picture) use the Windows character map or Mac Character Palette (see Method Two). Remove any extra spaces! The only space between the curly braces should be between EQ and \\o. Word inputs extra spaces that will have to be deleted manually. Press Shift-F9 (both PC and Mac) to update the field code and display the new symbol. You must either have the entire field code highlighted or be clicked into the field code for this to work. If there are any problems, just highlight the character (or error message, or blank space, etc.) and press Shift-F9 to display the field code again. Proceed to edit it as needed. See the Troubleshooting Tips below for more information about problems you may encounter here. Editing a Symbol's Height or Size Expand the field code by highlighting and pressing Shift-F9.  Highlight the symbol that needs to be changed, then right-click on it and click Font.  Go to the \"Character Spacing\" tab across the top.  Edit the \"Position\" field. It can be raised or lowered. Try 1 pt increments to start, and keep trying until the symbol is positioned exactly where desired. You can also type in a number, including decimals (i.e. 1.5,) for the amount of change in position.
