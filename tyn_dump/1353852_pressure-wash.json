                    "description": "An electric pressure washer is a basic washer that typically emits water between 1300 and 1900 psi. It's a good choice if you're planning on performing regular washes around your home. A typical electric pressure washer is good for washing cars, patio furniture, decks, exterior walls, or driveways. Psi stands for pounds per square inch, and is used to measure pressure. The higher the psi, the greater the pressure. You can buy a pressure washer at any big box hardware store. Some smaller hardware or cleaning supply shops may have them as well."

They are also more portable than electric pressure washers, since they don't need to be plugged in. They're much better than electric washers when it comes to cleaning stone, wood, and metal. Get a gas-powered washer if you need to clean stronger or tougher surfaces. Some gas-powered pressure washers emit a lot of fumes and cause a lot of noise when they're running. If you want a silent and clean pressure washer, avoid getting a gas-powered washer unless you really need the extra power. Pressure washers with high psi settings will be more expensive than standard pressure washers since they're capable of scouring tougher surfaces."
