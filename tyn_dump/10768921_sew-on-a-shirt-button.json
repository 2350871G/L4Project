                    "description": "Cut a piece of general, all-purpose thread that is about 18 in (46 cm) long. Insert the end of the thread through the eye of the needle until the ends are even. Then, tie a knot in the ends of the thread. Make sure that your needle will fit easily through the buttonholes in your button. Some needles have larger eyes to make it easier to thread them, but this can also interfere with sewing through small spaces.Tip: Coat your thread in beeswax to help the thread glide through your stitches and to strengthen it. Rub the thread along the side of a beeswax candle or get some wax on your thumb and forefinger, grasp the thread, and pull it through."

Unscrew or unlatch the presser foot to release it and set it aside. Then, locate the feed dog switch on your sewing machine and flip or turn it to lower them. This will prevent the fabric from moving while you sew.Warning: Be very careful to keep your fingers away from the needle as you sew! Sewing without a presser foot exposes the needle and you can seriously hurt yourself if the needle comes down on 1 of your fingers. If your machine does not have a feed dog switch, place a piece of paper over the feed dogs. This will prevent the machine from moving the shirt fabric as you sew, and then you can simply tear it away when you are finished. If you have a button presser foot, then install it now. This will help to hold the button in place while you sew. However, a button presser foot is not necessary for using this technique."
