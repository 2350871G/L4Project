Take stock of previous violent incidences that have occurred between you and your roommate. What did the worst fights you ever had look like? Was physical harm ever involved? Has your roommate ever stolen from you before in retaliation? It can help to write down dangerous or violent incidences in detail. This way, you can accurately determine what of the following you may need to do:\nGet outside support, like police assistance and legal action, to oversee the eviction and move out. This will be useful if there is a real likelihood that your roommate will respond violently. Take legal action to ensure that you have as little direct confrontation with your roommate as possible. These options will be best if avoidance seems like the best way to avoid a dangerous situation. Attempt to talk to your roommate with civility about the need for him/her to leave. If the danger is that your roommate will act out of anger from not being spoken to directly, or he/she has not demonstrated much actual violence against you, try simply handling the situation on your own."

You will have to resort to other methods, like contacting your landlord to enlist their help in evicting your roommate, as you have no legal right to do so. If you're the primary lessee, and rent is your sole legal responsibility each month, your roommate has no legal right to live with you. This is unusual, but is sometimes the case between close friends or in last-minute living arrangements. If your roommate is not on the lease at all, kick him/her out according to your judgment of the danger you're in. In most cases, renters have a joint lease where all tenants are responsible for paying the rent. The key term you're looking for is joint and/or several liability. If you're jointly liable, that means you're responsible for paying the full rent regardless of whether or not your roommate pays. If you're severally liable, you're only responsible for your portion of your rent. If you're jointly and severally liable, this is better than being jointly liable because while you're still responsible for any unpaid rent, you do have legal cause to sue your roommate for unpaid amounts."

Get a lock for your door. In case your roommate becomes enraged or vengeful, make sure that you and your valuables are secure by putting a lock on your bedroom door. You may need to take extra precautions, like installing heightened security systems, changing locks, or replacing wooden frames with metal if you\u2019re concerned that your roommate could come back to retaliate after the move out. If you still fear that theft will be a problem, ask a friend that your roommate does not know to watch your valuables for you. Be prepared to move out yourself. If you fear that the law will not be on your side dealing with your roommate, a good course of action is always to cut your losses and move out yourself. Pack up covertly, and plan a quick, efficient moving day when you know your roommate will be out of the house. Be sure to enlist lots of help from friends or professional movers so that you can move quickly with others present (in the case that you and your roommate have an altercation). Take care of yourself. Trouble at home is especially taxing since your problems literally live with you. Make sure that throughout this stressful process you are keeping as close as possible to your regular routines. As much as possible, get regular sleep and maintain a healthy diet. Be sure to surround yourself with a support system that includes friends and loved ones who can help you cope with the situation.",

        "If you're severally liable, you're only responsible for your portion of your rent.",

        "If you feel more comfortable using an official template, see a sample eviction notice.",
        "Even though you may not have the authority to evict your roommate, this template may provide a valuable jumping off point for using to-the-point language when writing the letter.",
        "Line up a safe haven.",
        "The trickiest part about dealing with a dangerous roommate is that things that you want to happen immediately take a long time.",
        "The safest option would be for you to stop staying at your shared place from the time that you deliver a letter of notice until your roommate moves out.",
        "Even if this much precaution is not possible, try to line up at least two different places where you can stay if you feel uncomfortable at home.",
