In essence, you'll be hiding the pipes in plain sight. Even though the pipes will be out in the open, they will be fade into the background and become much less noticeable. Alternatively, you can make your pipes look like part of the d\u00e9cor by painting them in a fresh color that stands out. For instance, you could paint the pipes a bright color that coordinates with the rest of your kitchen d\u00e9cor, turning them into statement pieces instead of eyesores."

Use a mild detergent and warm water. After wiping the pipe with a soapy rag, wipe it down again with a second rag soaked in clean water to rinse away any detergent residue. Thoroughly dry the pipe with a dry rag before continuing. Leaving moisture on the pipe could cause it to rust and may prevent the paint from properly adhering to the surface."

It's also a good idea to protect yourself, too. Wear clothes that you do not mind getting paint on.

Once all of the coats are on, you'll need to let the paint dry for a longer period of time before touching the pipe or moving furniture back into the kitchen.

        "Space the staples 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart.",
        "Place the third batten.",
        "Use wood glue to attach the remaining third batten to the other end of the plywood box side.",
        "Position this third batten so that it runs parallel to the first.",
        "It should be to the inside of the plywood box side and on the opposite side of the wall.",
        "Reinforce the bond with wood staples or nails placed 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart.",
        "Add the second box side.",
        "Place the second measured and cut plywood side so that it covers the remaining exposed side of the pipe.",
        "One side of this piece of plywood should lie to the outside of the open batten.",
        "The other side of this piece should form a corner with the opposite piece of plywood (the one previously attached to the wall).",
        "Attach the plywood to both connecting battens using both wood glue and nails or staples.",
        "Paint as desired.",
        "If desired, you can minimize the appearance of the boxing by painting or staining it to match the color of the wall.",
        "Before painting, remove furniture from the room and cover the floor and all fixed appliances with plastic sheets.",
        "Doing so should prevent paint from splattering onto other surfaces.",
        "Seal the seams.",
        "After the paint dries, seal the seams with decorator's caulk or silicone.",
        "Squeeze a small, steady bead of caulk across each seam and let dry.",
        "Sealing the seams will prevent unwanted moisture from getting into the pipe boxing.",
        "If moisture does get into the boxing, it could create mold or cause the wood to rot.",
        "Once you seal the seams, the project is complete."
