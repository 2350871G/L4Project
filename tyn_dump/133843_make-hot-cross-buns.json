You may also need to remove the top rack if there's not much space between the middle and top racks. There should be at least 5 inches (13 cm) of space between the racks. Mix all-purpose flour with water to make a white paste. Get out a small bowl and put 2/3 cup (75 g) of all-purpose flour into it. Stir 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water into it at a time until the paste is smooth and thick. Add up to 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of water in order to make a paste you can pipe.Did You Know?
