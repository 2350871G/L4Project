For the best results, you want to mix as much baking soda as you can into a small bowl of water. Add a little baking soda at a time and mix slowly to fully saturate the water. 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water will hold 3 tablespoons (43.2 grams) of baking soda. If your \u201cink\u201d has deposits of baking soda that won\u2019t dissolve, the solution is over saturated.

Hair dryers can be turned up to a high heat and waved evenly over the page. A dry iron can reveal the letters of your message as well.
