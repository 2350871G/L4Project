Use circular motions while washing the mask off; this will turn it into a scrub, and help the oatmeal exfoliate your skin. Once you have the mask all off, splash your face with cool water, and pat your face dry with a soft, clean towel. If you need to, follow up with some toner and moisturizer. Making a Pumpkin and Yogurt Mask Make a pumpkin and yogurt mask if you'd like soft, smooth skin. One of the reasons why skin may appear dry and dull is because it needs to be exfoliated. The ingredients in this mask can help your skin appear smoother and softer by gently exfoliating away the dead skin cells, which contribute to a dry, dull complexion. Start with 4 tablespoons of organic pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Pumpkin contains enzymes that gently exfoliate away dead skin. This will reveal the soft, smooth skin underneath. It is also rich in vitamin C and K, which can help fade sun spots and age spots, and lead to brighter, healthier-looking skin. Add 2 to 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of plain yogurt. If you can, try to use full-fat Greek yogurt, as it will be the most hydrating and moisturizing for your skin. Yogurt is great for the skin because it is hydrating and moisturizing. The lactic acid in yogurt also makes it naturally exfoliating, which can leave your skin feeling soft and smooth. Some people also find that yogurt helps brighten their skin as well. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Honey is incredible for the skin. It is hydrating and moisturizing, making it perfect for dry or sensitive skin. It is also antibacterial and antimicrobial, making it great for those suffering from acne. Consider adding \u00bd teaspoon of ground cinnamon. While not completely necessary, this can lend your mask a wonderful aroma. It does have antimicrobial properties, however, making it ideal for those who are struggling with acne. Mix everything together with a fork. Scrape the bottom and sides of the cup or bowl often to ensure that everything gets mixed in. You want the color and texture to be even and consistent, with no streaks or swirls of yogurt. Spread the mask over a clean face. Wash your hands first, then your face. Pat your face dry, then apply the mask using your fingers. Take care to avoid the sensitive skin around your eyes. It might also be a good idea to clip or tie your hair back at this point so that it doesn't get dirty. Wait 15 to 20 minutes. Try not to move around too much during this time, or the mask may start to drip. If you want to, sit or lay down someplace comfortable, and listen to your favorite music. Wash the mask off using lukewarm water and circular motions. Once you have the mask all off, splash your face with cool water to seal the pores. Pat your face dry with a soft, clean towel, then follow up with toner and moisturizer, if desired. Store the rest of the mask in an airtight container in the fridge, and use it within a few weeks. You can use this mask once to twice a week. Making a Pumpkin and Egg Mask Make a pumpkin and egg mask if you have oily skin. When treating oily skin, it is important not to let it become too dry. If you let oily skin become dry, it will start to produce even more oils to compensate. This mask contains ingredients that may help control excess oil production without drying out your skin. Some of the ingredients are also helpful when it comes to treating acne. Beat 1 egg in a small cup or bowl with a fork or mini whisk. Crack an egg open into a small cup or bowl, then beat it briskly with a fork or mini whisk until it is pale and frothy. Egg yolks help hydrate skin, which is important even for oily skin types. The yolks also contain zinc, which can help treat acne. Egg whites help tighten the skin and close up pores, which can help reduce acne. Add 4 tablespoons of organic pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Pumpkin is rich in vitamins and minerals. It also contains zinc, which can help control hormone levels and excess oil production. Add 1 tablespoon of raw honey. Honey does wonders for the skin. It is a natural humectant, so it helps draw moisture into the skin. It is also naturally antibacterial and antimicrobial, so it helps manage acne. Add some milk or raw apple cider vinegar, if desired. At this point, your mask has all of the necessary ingredients, but you can make it even better by adding some milk or apple cider vinegar. Both do different things for your skin, so choose one that suits your skin's needs the best. If you have dull skin, add 1 tablespoon of milk. The lactic acid in milk is gently exfoliating, so it can leave your skin feeling softer, smoother, and brighter. If you have oily skin or acne, add 1 tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar. Mix it all together with a fork. Keep stirring the mixture until everything is evenly combined. You do not want to see any streaks or swirls of egg yolk. Apply the mask all over your face, taking care to avoid the eyes, nose, and mouth. Because this mask contains raw egg, it is very important to avoid the mouth and nose in addition to the eyes. You can apply the mask using your fingers, but make sure to wash them well first with soap and warm water. Keep your hair clipped or tied back so that the mask doesn't get all over it. Wait 15 to 20 minutes, or until the mask dries. Avoid moving around too much during this time, or the mask may start to drip. If you can, sit or lay down someplace comfortable. You can pass the time by reading a book, listening to music, daydreaming, or watching your favorite show. Wash the mask off. You may need to use a washcloth and some facial cleaner in order to get the mask all off. Once your face is clean, splash your face with cool water to seal your pores, then gently pat it dry with a soft, clean towel. Follow up with your usual toner and moisturizer, if desired. You can use this mask once a week.",
