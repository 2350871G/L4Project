Place a toothpick in the bottom of the thicker side and let dry for about 24 hours. These can be held up to dry by sticking the other side of the toothpick into a Styrofoam block or plastic cup. Make as many centers as roses needed.  Creating the Rose Color the gumpaste. After wearing gloves, use a toothpick and dip the edge into the desired gel paste color and mix it into the gumpaste. Knead until thoroughly mixed. Choose colors that match your theme. Make a small amount of green for the calyx of the rose. Roll out the gumpaste. Use the rolling pin to roll out the colored gumpaste for the rose petals on the rolling mat. This should be rolled out to about \u204416 inch (0.2 cm) thickness. Cover any remaining gumpaste that is not in use so that it doesn\u2019t dry out. Cut the petals. Use the tear-shaped cutter to cut out the rose petals. Around an average of 15 petals will be used for each rose. This will vary and mainly depend on the desired rose size. Shape the petals. Take each petal and place it on the foam pad one at a time. Use the ball tool to gently rub and outline the edge of the tear shaped petal. You may have to go over it once or twice to get the desired effect. Be careful not to rub too hard or you may rip the petal. This will give the rose a natural look. You may want to put a very small amount of cornstarch on the pad to prevent the gumpaste from sticking. Make the \"glue\". Using a small bowl, mix some water and a teaspoon of cornstarch.

Dab some of the \u201cglue\u201d onto the calyx, and thread it through the toothpick to the bottom of the rose. Doing this upside down may be easier.
