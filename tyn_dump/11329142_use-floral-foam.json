                    "description": "Wet foam soaks up as much as 10 times its weight in water. This makes it great for arranging live flowers, as the flowers will have access to water while being held in place. Choose wet foam in a medium density to care for most flowers. Know that wet foam stretches out easily, so you\u2019ll need to be precise when inserting each flower. Choose foam in a lighter density for flowers like tulips and spring bulb flowers, while plants with sturdy stems like tropicals need foam of a higher density. By watering the foam daily, your flowers should last just as long as they would in a normal vase full of water (the specific amount of time will differ depending on the type of plant)."
