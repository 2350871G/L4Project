The basic tools include a parting tool, gouge, skewed chisel and scraper. Set up the lathe. Use a space with good lighting and in an area that makes for easy cleanup for the wood chips and dust. Sketch out the shape you want to achieve on a sheet of paper. Keep the design within the limits of the wood blank and capacity of the lathe. Mark the center points. Begin turning by finding the center of the wood stock on each end. Draw a line from one corner to opposite corner on square or rectangular stock.

Mount the wood by centering it onto the headstock of the lathe spur. Slide the tailstock center spur up to the center of the other end of the wood. Next, lock it down. Turn the handle on the tailstock center. This drives the wood blank into the spurn of the headstock, securing it between the centers. Set the tool rest to an approximate center of the work piece. Get it as close as possible, without it hitting the work piece when it is turning. Start the lathe on slow speed. Use a gouge to rough out or round off the piece to the basic shape you need. Position the large gouge, tip turned up, onto the tool rest. Place the end of the handle against your hip. Slowly lower the tip until it engages the wood and begins to chatter. Work the gouge back and forth along the wood surface and against the tool rest until the chattering stops and the stock is round. Increase the speed of the lathe and use the small gouge to finish roughing out the shape. Use the parting tool with a pair of outside calipers. Use these tools to set the depth of cuts you will need.
