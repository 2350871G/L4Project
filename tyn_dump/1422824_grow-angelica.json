            "description": "Just be sure to plant quickly as the seeds lose viability quickly after harvesting. (Angelica seeds itself readily, so once it's growing, you should see it re-emerging continuously in your garden.) Alternatively, purchase a seedling from the nursery/garden centre. Sprinkle the seeds into a seed-raising tray filled with seed-raising mix. Cover the seeds minimally. Keep moist across the entire tray. Wait for the seeds to germinate. This will take around 3-4 weeks but this varies. If you see no signs after 4 weeks, assume the seeds did not take and try with a new batch. Division is another method for obtaining more angelica. Simply lift the plant when it is two years old, in the early spring. Divide the roots into smaller sections and replant immediately in loose, quality soil. If planting new seedlings from a parent plant, plant them some distance away from the parent plant."
