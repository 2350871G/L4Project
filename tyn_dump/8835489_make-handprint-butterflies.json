Wash the paint off of your hand first, then paint your other hand with the same color. Make a second handprint right next to the first one with the palms touching.

Have the palms on all prints meet in the middle. You can use the same color of paint as before, or a different one. Use the side of your hand and more paint for the body. Paint the side of your palm and pinky with black or brown paint. Press it against the paper, right between the wings to make the body of the butterfly. You can also make the body by painting your thumb and making a row of dots. Use your thumb and more paint for the head. Wash your hand first, then paint your thumb the same color as the body.

They can be the same color or different colors. These sheets will eventually make your butterfly's wings, so pick a nice color. Trace your hand onto the paper. You can keep your fingers closed or have them open. Cut your traced hands out. Keep the paper folded when you cut. This way, you will have a total of four hands when you are done. Glue the hands together at the palms. Take two hands and hold them so that the palms touch and the thumbs point upward. Glue them together along the palm. Repeat for the second set of hands. You've just finished your wings. Angle the hands slightly to make a V shape at the thumbs. Glue the wings together. Turn one set of wings over so that the thumbs point down. Overlap the two wing sets in the middle, then glue them together. The thumbs on the top set should point up. The thumbs on the bottom set should point down. Cut a skinny oval out of black or brown paper for the oval. Glue it between the wings. If you want a fuzzy body, glue down a row of black or brown pompoms between the wings instead.
