Make sure the wiper blades aren't worn or misshapen because that affects how efficiently they wipe raindrops away. If your blades are worn out, buy replacements at any hardware or automotive parts store. If you have a windshield wiper on the rear window, pull that one up as well. Note that if you\u2019re applying it to the back window, you\u2019ll need a second applicator because a single applicator only covers a little more than 1 windshield."
