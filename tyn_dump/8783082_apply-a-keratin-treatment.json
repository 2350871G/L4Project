Doing a keratin treatment yourself won\u2019t give you custom results, since at-home treatments don\u2019t evaluate your individual hair type. At-home treatments tend to be less damaging, but also shorter lasting. For example, if you have a light hair color, a salon professional can adjust the formula so that the tonality of your shade doesn\u2019t change.

The hair is first washed and clarified to remove any impurities. Afterwards, the keratin solution is applied to the hair in sections, thoroughly dried, then ironed into the hair to bond and seal.
