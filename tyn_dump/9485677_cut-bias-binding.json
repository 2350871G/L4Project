If you do not have a cutting mat and rotary cutter and do not want to purchase these items, then you may also use scissors and a ruler to make your cuts.

Cutting the Bias Binding Strips Cut off the end of the rectangle. Place your clear ruler across the shorter area of the rectangle so that it is about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the edge. Then, run the rotary cutter along the edge of the ruler to cut this 0.5 in (1.3 cm) strip off of the rectangle. Measure and cut 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) sections across the rectangle. After you remove the end piece, turn the piece of fabric around and begin cutting 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) sections all the way across the rectangle. You can make your strips smaller or larger if desired by increasing or decreasing the width of the strips. Make sure to cut across the shortest portion of the rectangle.
