        "Alternatively, you can release the joystick and allow it to pop back to the neutral position.",
        "The joysticks on scissor lifts will almost always flip back to the center so that the lift stops moving when you release the joystick.",
        "When going up, stay alert and look above and around you to ensure that you don\u2019t strike anything while moving up.",
        "Make sure that nobody is standing nearby the lift while you\u2019re raising it.",
        "Pull the joystick back to lower the lift back down.",
        "To lower the lift, simply pull the stick back towards you.",
        "The platform will continue to lower so long as you keep the joystick held back.",
        "To stop moving down, either push the joystick to the center position or release the handle.",
        "Before you move a lift down, look over the rails to make sure that it\u2019s safe.",
        "The rails fold on one another as a scissor lift lowers, and a person may be injured if they\u2019re touching the lift when it starts moving.",
        "As you move down, look down to keep an eye out for people passing by.",
        "Do not lower a scissor lift if someone is within 20 feet (6.1 m) of the lift.",
        "Driving the Scissor Lift Lower the scissor lift all the way down before driving it.",
        "Before you drive anywhere, lower the lift as low as it can go.",
        "Your scissor lift will be more likely to tip over if you drive it while the platform is raised.",
        "Never drive the lift if the platform is raised.",
        "Depending on where you live, it is usually a safety violation to move a scissor lift if the platform is raised.",
        "Set the horizontal switch all the way to the right.",
        "To shut off the hydraulic power and shift the lift into drive mode, identify the horizontal switch on your control panel.",
        "Flip this switch all the way to the right.",
        "If the controls are labeled, this position is usually labeled \u201cdrive.\u201d\nYou cannot raise or lower the platform while the lift is in drive mode, so always lower the platform before using this switch.",
        "Set the vertical switch to the \u201cslow\u201d position to stay safe.",
        "When you drive the lift, the speed of the lift is controlled by the vertical switch.",
        "Flip this switch all the way to the lowest position to ensure that you maintain control of the lift while you\u2019re driving it.",
        "The \u201cfast\u201d position is usually used to navigate rows in a warehouse where the lift doesn\u2019t need to go left or right.",
        "Push the joystick forward or backward to drive the lift.",
        "With the horizontal switch flipped all the way to the right, push the joystick forward to drive forward.",
        "If you want to go in reverse, pull the joystick backwards.",
        "Always wait for the lift to come to a complete stop before swapping between forward and reverse.Tip: Newer scissor lift joysticks are calibrated to be sensitive to how hard you push or pull it when the stick is in drive mode.",
        "If you barely move the stick, you will move a few inches at a time.",
        "If you push the stick all the way in either direction, you will move as fast as your speed setting allows.",
        "Use the toggle on the top of the joystick to move left or right.",
        "If you want to change directions, press the toggle switch on top of the joystick with your thumb.",
        "If you want to turn left, press the left side of the switch down.",
        "If you want to turn right, press the right side of the switch down.",
        "Hold the switch in place to continue rotating the lift as you drive.",
        "Scissor lifts can\u2019t turn at sharp angles; it usually takes multiple control inputs to turn the lift around sharp corners.",
        "Move slowly and take breaks between movements to stay safe.",
        "Scissor lifts can be kind of awkward to drive, especially if you aren\u2019t used to using them.",
        "To stay safe while driving a scissor lift, only use one control input at a time and carefully monitor the speed and direction of the lift as it moves.",
        "Release the joystick in between inputs to allow the scissor lift to stop moving before changing directions.",
        "Never change directions without letting the lift come to a complete stop first.",
        "While driving the lift, always look at the ground where you\u2019re driving the lift to watch out for obstructions or changes in the texture of the floor.",
        "If you\u2019re outside, look up once every 2-3 seconds to make sure that you aren\u2019t at risk of running into a powerline or tree.",
        "If you move the joystick back and forth while changing directions at the same time, you may knock the scissor lift over or fall off of the platform.",
        "In addition, you may run into an obstruction or hole if you move too quickly, which can disrupt the lift or knock you off.",
        "Taking the Proper Safety Precautions Wear a safety harness and connect it to the strap on the platform.",
        "Get a safety harness from a construction supply store or a scissor lift manufacturer.",
        "Put the harness on and clip it in the center and on the sides to secure it.",
        "Pull the straps on each side to tighten it to your frame.",
        "On the floor of the platform, look for a retractable length of nylon with a hook on the end.",
        "Clip this hook to your safety harness to stay safe if you fall.",
        "The nylon strap will extend 6 feet (1.8 m) before locking, so you have plenty of room to move around on the platform.",
        "Monitor the battery or fuel gauge to ensure you don\u2019t get stuck.",
        "There is a gauge next to the switches on your control panel that measures how much fuel or electricity is left.",
        "Monitor this gauge carefully while operating your lift to ensure that you don\u2019t run out of fuel or electricity while you\u2019re raised up in the air.",
        "If you do run out of energy while the platform is raised, you\u2019ll need someone else to charge the battery or fill the tank for you before you can get back down.",
        "The vast majority of scissor lifts are electric.",
        "Operate the scissor lift on firm, flat surfaces.",
        "Never use a scissor lift on grass, gravel, or unstable ground.",
        "Scissor lifts tend to become quite unstable if they\u2019re on an uneven surface, which is a serious safety hazard.",
        "Only use a scissor lift on asphalt, concrete, or hardwood surfaces.Tip: It is usually illegal to operate a scissor lift on an uneven surface.",
        "Inspect the scissor lift before using it to check for wear and tear.",
        "Before using a scissor lift, always walk around the exterior of the machine.",
        "Inspect each wheel to look for punctures or tears.",
        "Check each tire to ensure that your wheels are properly inflated.",
        "Check the rails that lift the platform for cracks or obstructions to ensure that the machine is safe to operate.",
        "If you\u2019re unsure if a scissor lift is safe to use, have a certified mechanic inspect the machine before using it.",
        "Get certified as a scissor lift operator if you want to really stay safe.",
        "If you\u2019re operating a scissor lift for your employer, they are legally required to train you on how to use the scissor lift.",
        "If you\u2019re renting a scissor lift, consider taking a safety class in your area to earn an operator certification.",
        "While this certification isn\u2019t normally required to use a scissor lift, it\u2019s a good way to ensure that you don\u2019t make a serious mistake when using the machine.",
        "Operator certifications for scissor lifts usually take less than a week to earn.",
        "In some states and countries, you are required to take a class on scissor lifts before you are allowed to operate one.",
        "However, these safety certifications are optional everywhere else.",
        "While it changes depending on where you live, scissor lifts are usually considered to be a type of scaffolding.",
        "Standing on scaffolding does not typically require a certification."
