    "text": " Baking a Pull-Apart Cupcake Cake Decide on a pattern. This will depend on what occasion the cake is for! If you\u2019re celebrating a child\u2019s birthday party, think about doing a simple rendition of their favorite animal, like a turtle; cartoon character; or activity, like an airplane. For a holiday, go with a simple symbol, like a Christmas tree or a dreidel. Calculate the number of cupcakes you\u2019ll need. Lay out cupcake liners in your chosen pattern on the large plate or piece of clean cardboard you plan to arrange your cupcakes on. Make sure they can all fit snugly, adding or subtracting cups as needed. Your final number of cups will be the number of cupcakes you\u2019ll make. This recipe makes 20-25 standard-sized cupcakes. If you need more or less than that, adjust the measurements accordingly. For example, if you want to make 40 cupcakes, use 4 cups (950 mL) of flour, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of salt, 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of baking powder, etc. You could also use mini cupcakes. A recipe that makes 20 standard cupcakes can be used to make about 60 mini cupcakes. Preheat your oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) and line the pan with paper liners. If you\u2019re making mini cupcakes, preheat to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Mix your batter. Stir your butter and sugar with a wooden spoon or a mixer on medium speed until it\u2019s light and fluffy. If you\u2019re using a mixer, this should take 2-3 minutes. Stir in one egg at a time, then add the flour, baking powder and salt. Pour in your milk and stir well, then add your vanilla (optional). Stir until smooth. Soften the butter by leaving it out for a few hours before you start mixing your batter. Use a mixer if possible, as the batter will be much harder to stir with a wooden spoon. Vanilla will add a sweeter flavor, which is a great way to sweeten up your typical boxed cake mix. Pour the batter into the tray. You can use a large measuring glass with a pointy lip to get a neater pour. Fill each cup about halfway, making sure to divide the batter equally so you get an even bake. Bake the cupcakes for 18 minutes. Check on your cupcakes after about 10 minutes to make sure they\u2019re rising but not burning. They shouldn\u2019t be darker on top by the time you pull them out. Then, let them cool in their pans for about 10 minutes.You can check if your cupcakes are done by sticking a toothpick into the center of one cupcake. Pull it back out and check to see if there is wet batter on it. If so, your cupcakes need some more time. Put them in for 5 more minutes, then check on them again. When the toothpick comes back dry, your cupcakes are ready to go. If you\u2019re making mini cupcakes, bake for 10-15 minutes. Make your icing. Microwave your butter for 10-30 seconds or leave it out for a few hours, until it\u2019s slightly soft but not melted. Mix it with sugar in a large bowl, using a mixer on medium setting or a wooden spoon, until light and fluffy. Mix in the whipping cream, vanilla, and any food coloring you want and stir until the frosting is thick but spreadable.If you want to use different colors in your pattern, separate the frosting evenly into different bowls, then add your desired food coloring to each bowl. \u201cGlue\u201d your cupcakes to your plate with a swirl of frosting. Transfer your frosting to a piping bag, or make your own by poking a small hole in the bottom corner of a resealable plastic bag. Squirt a circle of frosting onto the bottom of each cupcake, directly onto the paper liner. Place each cupcake firmly back onto the plate or cardboard.Make this squirt of frosting roughly circular and slightly smaller than the bottom of the cupcake, but don\u2019t fill it in. Push your cupcakes together for a tighter fit. Gently press the cupcakes together with your hands so that each one is pushed flush against its neighbors. This will prevent too much icing from slipping into the cracks between cupcakes. Ice the cupcakes smoothly for a cake-like look. Use your piping bag to put a small dollop in any remaining diamond-shaped holes between cupcakes. Outline the outside edge of your pattern with frosting, then fill in the rest. Smooth it over with an icing scraper or a flat plastic spatula. Decorate with other colors of frosting or sprinkles. Ice the cupcakes individually to make different frosting patterns. You could do rose-style icing or simple swirls with your piping bag. The cupcakes may feel like less of a cohesive cake, but this method could be best for some patterns. If you\u2019re making a large flower out of cupcakes, for example, you may want to frost the cupcakes individually to make them look like individual petals. You also might wish to create a certain illusion of texture, for cakes in the shape of animals or birds. Making a Giant Cupcake Cake with a Mold Get a large silicon cupcake cake pan. The easiest way to make a giant cupcake is to use a specialized, two-part silicone pan. One side of the pan will be the bottom of the cake, with accordion folds along the sides to make it look like a paper cupcake liner. The top will be dome-like with a point, mimicking the shape of a regular cupcake. You can find a cupcake cake pan online or at a specialty baking store. Preheat your oven to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Let it warm up as you prepare you batter. Coat your cupcake pan with non-stick spray. Spray the pan carefully, making sure to completely cover the accordion folds in the pan. You can also brush on a liquid non-stick product, which might give you fuller coverage. Mix all batter ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour your cake mixes, pudding mixes, eggs, water and oil to a bowl. Use a mixer on a medium setting or a wooden spoon to mix until the batter is thick but pourable.You can also make your cake from scratch using your favorite Pound cake recipe. Make sure you make enough to fill up your mold. If you\u2019re not sure how much your recipe will fill, double the recipe just to be safe. Measure your batter and pour it into the pans. Pour 2.5 cups (590 mL) into the top, dome-like part of the cupcake, and 3.5 cups (830 mL) for the bottom. The pans shouldn\u2019t be totally filled; your cake will rise to fill the rest of the space. Bake your cakes at 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) for 1 hour. After half an hour, remove the cakes and put a loose tent of aluminum foil over the top part of the cupcake, then place them back in the oven for the remaining half hour. This will prevent it from cooking faster than the bottom part and becoming dry.When the hour is up, stick a toothpick into the cake. If it comes back wet, stick the cake back in at 5 minute intervals, continuing to use the toothpick to see if it\u2019s done. When the toothpick comes back dry, your cake is ready to go! Let your cakes cool in the pan for ten minutes. Then, remove the cakes from the pans and place them on a baking sheet. Let them finish cooling for about 10-15 minutes. Cut off the tops of your cakes to make them straight and level. To make sure you cut at the right height, place the cakes back in the cooled pan. Cut both the dome and the base cakes so that they\u2019re the same height as the cake pans.Use a long, flat, serrated knife for the most even cut. Mix up your icing. Microwave your butter for 10-30 seconds until it\u2019s slightly soft but not melted. Use a mixer on a medium setting or a wooden spoon to mix it with sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in the whipping cream, vanilla, and any food coloring you want. Keep stirring until the frosting is thick but spreadable.If you want to use different colors in your pattern, separate the frosting evenly into different bowls, then add your desired food coloring to each bowl. Frost the top of the bottom cake and place the other cake on the icing. Spread a layer of medium thickness onto the bottom portion of the cake, then set the top portion firmly on top. The frosting should \u201cglue\u201d it into place. Ice the rest of the cake and add sprinkles. You can ice the full cake, or just do the top portion to make it look more like a cupcake. Use a piping bag to spread the frosting in rosette patterns to add texture, or do a simple swirl. Add some sprinkles on top to complete your delicious cupcake cake! Making a Cupcake Cake without a Mold Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Let it warm up as you begin to make your batter. Make your cake batter. Let the butter soften for a few hours, then use a mixer on a medium setting or a wooden spoon to combine it with the sugar until fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, then add the vanilla. In a separate bowl, combine the flour and baking powder, then add it to the mixture and stir. Mix in the milk until the batter is smooth. Pour your cake batter into five shallow mixing bowls. To make a giant cupcake cake without a special mold, you\u2019ll need to bake five different cakes and stack them. The four base cakes will be smaller and flatter, about 9 inches (23 cm) across and 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) high, while the dome cake will be taller and more round. Divide your batter equally into four shallow bowls to make the base cakes. Use a layer of parchment paper to keep the batter from sticking. For the dome cake, simply fill the bowl a bit more.You can use round baking pans or stainless steel bowls to bake your cakes. If you don\u2019t have four bowls of the same size, simply pour the batter into the same bowl one cake at a time. Bake your cakes at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 20-30 minutes. Check on your cakes every 7 minutes or so, adjusting the time as needed. They should get golden brown on top, but shouldn\u2019t look burnt, and should feel springy to the touch. You can check if your cake is done by sticking a toothpick into the center. Pull it back out and check to see if there is wet batter on it. If so, put your cake back in for 5 minute intervals, checking the toothpick each time. When it comes back dry, your cake is ready to go. Remove the cakes from the oven and let cool. Let the cakes sit in the bowl for 10 minutes, then remove them and let them cool completely, for another 15-20 minutes, on a baking sheet. Taper the edges of your first three layers. Stack your four flat cakes on top each other. Use a long knife to cut about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the second layer and \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from the bottom layer, leaving the top third and fourth layers intact. You\u2019ll be cutting at a slant all around the circular cakes to achieve a cupcake-like base. Cut off the rounded top of the top cake. The dome-like cake that will serve as the top of your cupcake should only be rounded on one side. Use a knife to carefully level off the top of the cake, leaving the bottom, the part molded from the bowl, intact. Lay it flat side down on top of the other four cakes, using a knife to trim the sides and give it a slanted look.Put some cake scraps on the very top of the dome if you need to round it off. Make your icing. Microwave the butter for 10-30 seconds until it\u2019s slightly soft but not melted. Use a mixer on a medium setting or a wooden spoon to mix it with sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in the whipping cream, vanilla, and any food coloring you want. Keep stirring until the frosting is thick but spreadable. Frost the top of each cake. Use the same icing recipe as above. Take down your stack of cakes and smooth a layer of frosting on top of each one, starting with your bottom cake. Stop when you get to the dome cake on top.Level off any rounded tops to keep the cake stable. Trim away any pointy sides as well. Frost the whole cake and let it set in the refrigerator. Use a large, flat knife to frost your cake completely. Put it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to let the frosting harden. Roll out tubes of white fondant. The tubes should be about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick and 4 inches (10 cm) long. Use your fingers to roll them and a knife to cut them to the right length.You can buy fondant online or at baking stores, or make your own at home. Place your fondant rolls vertically along the bottom of the cake. Leave about \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of space between them and push them lightly into the surface of the cake. These will be the ripples at the bottom of your cupcake, which will look like the folds of a paper cupcake cup. Stick a roll of colored fondant over the tubes. Roll it out flat with a rolling pin and cut the sheet in half. Press one half onto the cake at a time, using the heat of your hands to help stick it to the cake\u2019s surface. The fondant may be a bit difficult to work with, so be patient and gently rub it into place. The fondant should only cover the bottom part of the cake, so trim away any extra with a knife.For a cleaner look, use a spoon to indent the fondant around the tubes at the very bottom of the cake. Frost the top of the cake. Use a piping bag and decorate the top of the cake however you want. You could use a rosette tip to cover the top in rose patterns, or spiral the frosting around the top. Decorate with sprinkles and enjoy!",
