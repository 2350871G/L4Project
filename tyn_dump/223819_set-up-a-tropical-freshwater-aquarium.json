Attach an aquarium heater to the back of your tank and plug it in to begin warming the water. Stick a thermometer onto the front of the glass to keep an eye on the temperature and adjust the heater accordingly. Make sure that your heater is installed with a drip loop. This is a small loop or dip in the cable just before it plugs into the wall socket. The drip loop will allow water to run down the cable and drip off the bottom of the loop rather than running into your electrical socket. The required temperature for your aquarium will depend on the fish you want to keep in it. Research the comfortable temperature for each fish before you purchase it to make sure it can thrive in your aquarium. Don\u2019t plug the heater in for 30 minutes after you put it into the tank. Otherwise, the sudden shift in temperature may cause your heater to shatter."

Make sure your lamp is also plugged in with a drip loop to reduce the chance of electrocution or electrical failure. If you are keeping live plants in your tank, you\u2019ll need at least 1 watt for every 1 litre (34  fl oz) in your tank. Otherwise, any lamp between 18- and 40-watts will work. Keep the lamp on a timer so that it is only on for 10 to 12 hours each day. Leaving it on for any longer than this can increase the temperature, rates of water evaporation, and algae growth.

To make this process go faster, add a small sprinkle of fish food to your tank, or ask your local pet store for some gravel or a dirty filter pad with plenty of good bacteria already on it. The water in your tank will need to have very low levels of ammonia and nitrites in order to be safe. You should just begin to see nitrates being produced when the water becomes safe."

If you can\u2019t find any at your local pet store, talk to an employee to see if they have any recommendations of a first tropical fish to buy. Whichever fish you buy, make sure you research the elements they require from a tank to check that you can keep them happy and healthy. It's easiest to start with 2 fish of the same species if you're setting up an aquarium for the first time. Make sure that the fish you choose are compatible with each other!

Place the hood and tank light over the aquarium. The hood will stop anything unwanted from getting into the aquarium, and the lamp will help the live plants in your tank thrive. If your hood doesn\u2019t have a lamp included, purchase an 18- to 40-watt aquarium lamp online or from your local pet store. Make sure your lamp is also plugged in with a drip loop to reduce the chance of electrocution or electrical failure. If you are keeping live plants in your tank, you\u2019ll need at least 1 watt for every 1 litre (34  fl oz) in your tank. Otherwise, any lamp between 18- and 40-watts will work. Keep the lamp on a timer so that it is only on for 10 to 12 hours each day. Leaving it on for any longer than this can increase the temperature, rates of water evaporation, and algae growth. Light timers should be available from your local hardware or electronics store. Some pet stores may also have them. Do a fishless cycle to build up bacteria in the filter. There are many bacteria that need to build up in your fish tank before it will be safe for fish to swim in it. Leave the filter to cycle for between 2 days and up to 1 week in order to build up the bacteria in your filter. Continue cycling your tank until the water is safe for fish. To make this process go faster, add a small sprinkle of fish food to your tank, or ask your local pet store for some gravel or a dirty filter pad with plenty of good bacteria already on it. The water in your tank will need to have very low levels of ammonia and nitrites in order to be safe. You should just begin to see nitrates being produced when the water becomes safe. Adding Fish to the Tank Choose 1 or 2 tropical fish to begin with. Adding too many fish to the water at once can throw off the balance of ammonia, nitrates, and bacteria that you\u2019ve built up. Choose 1 or 2 tropical fish that are easy to care for to start off your new aquarium. African cichlids and neon tetras make for great first fish in your tropical aquarium. If you can\u2019t find any at your local pet store, talk to an employee to see if they have any recommendations of a first tropical fish to buy. Whichever fish you buy, make sure you research the elements they require from a tank to check that you can keep them happy and healthy. It's easiest to start with 2 fish of the same species if you're setting up an aquarium for the first time. Make sure that the fish you choose are compatible with each other! Some fish will attack, stress, or even eat other species of fish. Look online or ask at your local pet store when adding new fish to your tank. Turn off the lights in the aquarium. Bright lights in the tank when your fish are first introduced will likely stress them out and make them take longer to adjust to their new home. Turn off the lamp in your tank, and make sure there are plenty of hiding places so your fish can adjust to swimming around at their own pace. You can turn the lamp back onto its regular timer once the fish have adjusted to the tank and are swimming around by themselves. If your fish are stressed out, they may become sick and die more easily. Anything you can do to reduce their stress will only make them happier and healthier. Let the fish acclimate to the water before adding them to the tank. Float the plastic bag that your new fish came in on top of your aquarium to equalize the temperatures. After 20 minutes or so, add water from the tank to the bag to double the amount of water the fish can swim in. Wait another 20 minutes before scooping the fish out of the bag and into the tank with a net. Pouring the fish straight into new water will shock them, which can be detrimental to their health. This will help them adjust to the water in the tank slowly. Avoid mixing water from the bag into the water in the tank, as this can be detrimental to the tank water. Don\u2019t feed your fish on their first day in the tank. They\u2019ll likely be too stressed to eat, so the food will sink to the bottom and rot. Feed them every other day for 4 to 6 weeks after this, before changing to the recommended feeding schedule for your fish. Watch the fish for signs of illness. Keep an eye on your fish over the next few days to make sure they are adjusting to the aquarium properly. If your fish seems inactive or slow-moving, check that they aren\u2019t ill and treat them properly if they seem unwell. There are many different indicators that your fish may be stressed or unwell. If they are not eating, spending a lot of time near the surface, sticking to the bottom of the tank, or not eating, it could be a sign that something is wrong. Keep an eye on your fish's skin as well. Any changes, tears, or colored spots could be a sign that your fish is ill and needs to be treated for a new illness. Test the water every day for at least 1 month. As your fish begin living in the tank, eating food, and producing waste, they may begin throwing off the balance of your aquarium. Test the water in your tank every 1 or 2 days to make sure the pH level stays the same, and the ammonia levels don\u2019t begin to rise. Raise and lower  the pH of your fish tank as you need to to keep it within the comfortable range for your fish. If you notice the levels of ammonia creeping up in your fish tank, change the water and avoid over-feeding your fish to lower ammonia levels in the tank. Most water testing kits will have indicator strips that you can either dip into the water or drop water onto, with the indicators changing colors depending on levels. Check the manufacturer's instruction for more specific advice on how to use and read the indicators in your own set. Add more fish after 4 to 6 weeks. You should give your first few fish plenty of time to adjust to their new home before adding any more fish to the tank. Begin adding new fish to the aquarium after 4 to 6 weeks if you want to, making sure that every fish can live comfortably together and that they are added to the tank safely. There are many different reasons that different species of fish won\u2019t be able to live together. Make sure that your fish are compatible before adding them to the same tank.",
