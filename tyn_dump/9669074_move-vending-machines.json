Knowing the machine's exact dimensions will help you determine whether you'll be able to move it along your chosen path unobstructed. It may also affect the type of jack you use. Full-size units, like beverage and snack machines, should always go on a pallet jack with forks that are a minimum of 42 inches (110 cm) long. Smaller machines can be loaded onto a 36 inch (91 cm) jack, provided the forks cover the full length or width. If the machine is too big to move through an area as planned, you may have to map out a new route."
