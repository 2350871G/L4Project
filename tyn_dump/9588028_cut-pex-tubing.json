You can also buy an automatic expander tool if you have to make a large number of these connections. Measuring and Making the Cut Straighten out the PEX tubing as much as possible. To ensure that you measure PEX tubing properly and cut it evenly, straighten out the tubing. Fold the tubing upward in the opposite direction that it is curling. Lay it down on a flat surface to make sure it is as straight as possible. Measure your piping and add about 1 inch (2.5 cm). PEX piping should never be stretched tightly between fittings. Use a measuring tape to find out exactly how much piping you need, then add about 1 inch (2.5 cm). This will leave room for the flexible piping to expand and contract.

Squeeze the cutter again and twist it downwards slightly to finish the cut. Cutting PEX Tubing to Remove Crimp Rings Clamp a pair of pliers beside the fitting. Fittings are secured with crimp rings, so it can be difficult to remove the latter without damaging the former. Start by gripping 1 side of the fitting with the open mouth of a pair of pliers. Clamp them down on the PEX piping as closely to the fitting as possible. The pliers will allow you to cut closely to the fitting but prevent you from cutting down onto it. Position your PEX cutter on the opposite side of the fitting and cut. With your free hand, place the open mouth of your PEX cutter over the tubing, on the other side of the fitting. The tool should be right next to the pliers, leaving just enough space to accommodate the fitting. Squeeze the tool to cut through the PEX piping. Use a PEX crimp ring cutter to remove the ring.

Place the fat part of the mouth of the cutter on top of the crimp ring, leaving the skinny part underneath it. Slowly squeeze the handles until the blade at the top cuts though the ring. Installing PEX Tubing Cut the piping and place a compression ring on the end. Use a PEX cutter or PVC cutter to cut the piping to the length you need. Slide a compression ring onto the end of the pipe. The ring will help secure your PEX piping to a valve, fitting, or manifold. Compression fittings are available in different sizes. Choose the size that corresponds to the size of your PEX tubing. Stretch the piping with an expander tool. Insert the head of your expander tool into the end of the cut pipe.
