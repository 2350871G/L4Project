Depending on what color of dye you want, you may need to special order it online from a dye company. The exception to the rule about color-matching is if you were to try and mix together 2 different shades of acid dyes. Each dye has multiple pigments that could mix with pigments from another dye and change the outcome of the color to be different than expected; the results might be slight but it also could be dramatic. If you want to do this, test the mixed dyes on a piece of scrap nylon first."

The color of your nylon might be slightly different than what's on the box because all-purpose dyes include 2 types of dye: a direct dye for cotton and a leveling-acid dye for wool/nylon. Only the leveling-acid dye will affect your nylon. While the color won't be exact, it will still be very close to what's on the box or label. Just keep in mind that there might be a slight difference, especially if you're trying to match your nylon to the color of something else (like a pair of pantyhose with your favorite red lipstick)."
