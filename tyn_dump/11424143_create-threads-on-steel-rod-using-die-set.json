The optimal diameter would be 0.005 inches to 0.010 inches less than the normal diameter of the rod. If diameter at the end to be threaded is greater than the optimal diameter, either sandpaper or a file may be used to bring the rod end to the optimal diameter. One easy way to accomplish a fast and even reduction in diameter is to put the rod into a drill motor to rapidly rotate the rod while removing material. Clamp a file in a bench vice such that the rounded portion of the rod can contact the file. Continually drive the drill motor and check the diameter intermittently as filing. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/11\\/Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_ChuckUpRod-1.jpg\\/460px-Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_ChuckUpRod-1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/1\\/11\\/Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_ChuckUpRod-1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0d\\/Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_DrillGrinding-1.jpg\\/460px-Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_DrillGrinding-1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/0\\/0d\\/Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_DrillGrinding-1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ad\\/Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_AfterDiameterMeasure-1.jpg\\/460px-Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_AfterDiameterMeasure-1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/a\\/ad\\/Ryguy_wikiHow_Project2_AfterDiameterMeasure-1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nIf the diameter becomes less than the optimal range, efficacy will be reduced or it may become unusable."
