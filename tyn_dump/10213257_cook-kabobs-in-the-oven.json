Use one hand to hold the ziplock bag open and the other hand to gently pour the marinade into the bag. Close the ziplock bag and check that no marinade is leaking from the seal.

Don\u2019t leave the chicken to marinate for more than 24 hours as this increases the risk of food poisoning. Constructing the Kabobs Preheat the oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C). Turn your oven to the bake setting and set it to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C). Place the oven rack in the middle shelf of the oven. This will help the kabobs to cook evenly. Most ovens take at least 10 minutes to heat up. Cut the peppers into 1 inch (2.5 cm) strips. Cut the bell peppers in half and pull out the seeds from the middle.

Cut the onion in half lengthways and then crossways, to create quarters that are approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size. Peel apart the layers of the chopped onion so you have thin chunks of onion. Repeat this process for both onions. Push the chicken and vegetables onto the skewers. Remove the chicken from the fridge. Push a piece of chicken onto the skewer so that it is about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the bottom of the skewer. Place a vegetable onto the skewer and push it down until it is touching the chicken. Keep repeating this process until you have filled the kabobs with chicken and vegetables. Leave about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) at the top of the stick. Repeat this process until you have used all the vegetables and chicken. Place the kabobs on an oven tray that has been lined with aluminum foil. Tear a sheet of aluminum foil that is the width of the oven dish. Line the dish with the foil and place the kabobs on top. Spread the kabobs evenly across the dish. Make sure that the kabobs aren\u2019t touching each other. Baking the Kabobs Place the kabobs into the oven for 15 minutes. Transfer the tray into the middle shelf of the oven. Leave the tray uncovered as this will allow the vegetables to become crispy. Remove the tray from the oven after 15 minutes. Use oven mitts when touching the hot tray. Remove the kabobs from the oven and flip the skewers over. Take the oven tray out of the oven and place it onto a heat-proof surface. Use tongs to gently turn over each kabob.
