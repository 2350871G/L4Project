Using the purple rods, form the rectangle, attaching them to each other with the gray snowflake-like connectors (from here on referred to as snowflakes). For this step, you'll need 10 purple rods, four grey snowflake connectors, and 12 blue connectors. Use the blue connectors to close up the four corners of the rectangle.  Making the standing base Connect five purple rods, using two silver/white connectors on top and two snowflakes on the bottom. (The image in the next step will assist you.) Attach three blue rods to the snowflakes. Have one facing downward and two splayed either side. Refer to the image. Repeat the process to make a second standing base. You should end up with two standing bases that look the same. Connect the first standing base structure to the bottom rectangular base. Criss cross with the blue base to ensure stability. See the image for direction on fixing the criss crossed piece. Connect the other standing base in the same manner, on the opposite side. Once again, perform the criss cross movement to strengthen the structure. Making the two wheels Assemble the K'NEX pieces needed. You'll now need eight red rods and four purple connectors. For every two red rods, use one purple connector to connect the two together. Go ahead and connect the red rods with the purple connectors. You should now have have four long red rods. Get one black connector, four blue rods and the four longer red rods you just attached together. Attach the blue and red rods to the the black connector in a circular motion. Use the pattern formation of red then blue, red then blue, and so on. This is now referred to as the star. Use two white tubes and insert them opposite to each other in the red slots.
