                    "description": "You can buy the materials you need to fiberglass your pond from the hardware store or online. The typical fiberglass used for ponds is a 450g chopped strand mat. This fiberglass is durable enough to retain the water from a pond. Purchase an epoxy or polyester resin when you buy the fiberglass sheets. Flowcoat looks like paint and comes in a variety of colors. Adding a layer of flowcoat over the fiberglass is the finishing touch for your project and will make the walls of your pond shiny and smooth. It should cost around $5-$10 for 3 by 3 metres (9.8 by 9.8 ft) of fiberglass mat. Polyester resin should cost around $20-$30 for 1 gallon (3.8 L) while epoxy resin can cost up to $100 for a gallon. Flowcoat should cost between $5-$20 for 1 gallon (3.8 L)."

Flowcoat should cost between $5-$20 for 1 gallon (3.8 L). Tape off areas that you don\u2019t want to fiberglass. Use painter\u2019s tape to tape off the areas around the lip of the pond. Apply the tape so that it wraps around the entirety of the pond's perimeter. Wear gloves when handling fiberglass. A thick pair of rubber gloves will stop the fiberglass from agitating your skin and will prevent you from damaging the fiberglass cloth. Wear a respirator when working on an indoor pond. If the pond is indoors, make sure that you\u2019re working in a well-ventilated area and use a respirator. Wearing the proper gear will prevent you from inhaling the toxic fumes from the resin and particles from the fiberglass sheets. Measure the walls and floor of your pond.

Purchase a rolling cutter or fiberglass scissors at an art and crafts store or online. Cut out the sheets to your measurements.

Many epoxy resins will also come with a hardener that you must mix with the resin. Read the instructions on the package so that you know how to mix them properly. Continue to mix your resin as you work so that it doesn\u2019t harden. 2 kg (4.4 lbs) of resin is suitable for 2 square meters (6.5 sq. feet) of fiberglass cloth. You can purchase the resin at hardware stores or online. Laying the Fiberglass Apply the resin to the wall with a brush or roller. Saturate a brush or roller into the resin. Apply it to the wall on the wall in long, horizontal strokes. Break up your work into 5 by 5 feet (1.5 m \u00d7 1.5 m) spaces. Working in smaller portions will help you manage the entire project and will prevent the resin from drying out while you work. Lay a sheet of fiberglass cloth over the resin. Drape the cloth over the resin and flatten the sheet out with your hand, making sure there aren\u2019t any air bubbles in the cloth. Apply more resin to the top of the fiberglass cloth. Saturate your brush again and apply the resin over the top of the fiberglass sheets in long horizontal motions. The sheets should become transparent once saturated. Lay a second and third sheet of fiberglass cloth over the first one. Drape another sheet of fiberglass over the first sheet. Press against the second layer of fiberglass and get the wrinkles out of it and apply another coat of resin over that cloth. Repeat the steps until there are three coats of fiberglass cloth on the walls. The third layer of fiberglass should have resin applied over the surface of the cloth as well. Repeat the steps until all of the walls are covered in fiberglass. Continue to apply the fiberglass to the walls of your pond until all of them have been covered in three layers of fiberglass. Repeat the process to fiberglass the floor. Once all of the walls and the floor has fiberglass applied, you'll be done applying the fiberglass cloth. Let the resin dry for two hours. Cover the pond with a tarp so that dirt and other debris doesn't get stuck to the resin. Once you've given the fiberglass time to dry, you can apply the flowcoat. Applying Flowcoat Over the Fiberglass Sand the surface with 80 grit sandpaper. Sand over the surface of the fiberglass cloth once it has dried. You don't want to sand through the fiberglass cloth, but you do want to sand off bumps and imperfections. Mix the Flowcoat. You will usually have to mix a catalyst with the flowcoat before applying it to the walls. Read the instructions on the back of the flowcoat and mix it until it reaches a paint-like viscosity. Spread Flowcoat onto the fiberglass with a brush or roller. Use a roller or a brush and spread the flowcoat in horizontal, then vertical strokes. Cover the walls, then the floor of the pond. The flowcoat should look like a dark black paint. Work in 5 by 5 feet (1.5 m \u00d7 1.5 m) areas until the entire pond is covered. Continue to apply the flowcoat over the surface of the pond\u2019s walls, then the floor of the pond. Working in smaller sections will help you manage the flowcoat and help you achieve equal coverage. Lay a tarp over the pond and let the flowcoat dry. Allow the flowcoat to dry for a full 72 hours. Lay a tarp over the pond so that nothing can disrupt the flowcoat while it sets. Once it's dry, you've successfully finished applying a fiberglass coating on your pond.",
