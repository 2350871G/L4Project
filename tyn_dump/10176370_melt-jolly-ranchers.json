                    "description": "A bowl will work, but depending on where you will be pouring the melted candy, a coffee cup will pour a little cleaner. If you are microwaving more than 4 candies at a time, you will need to increase the cooking time. 4 candies will produce about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid. Be sure whatever it is has a handle because the candy will be quite hot once melted. A glass Pyrex measuring cup works quite well. If heating multiple batches, though, give the glass time to slowly cool between heating."

This should get all four pieces to melt in one go. If the candies do not melt entirely on the first heat, cook them again in 15-second intervals. Then in the second batch, heat for the combined time."
