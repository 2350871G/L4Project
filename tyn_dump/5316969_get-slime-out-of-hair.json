You can also just dip the hair in warm water if the slime is near the ends.Massage the conditioner in with your fingers, going the same direction as the hair growth. Use your fingers to break up the slime as much as possible. Oil helps break down the slime, and conditioners are generally oil-based. By starting with conditioner, you'll begin to break down the slime so you can pull it out of the hair. Use a comb to help break up the slime. Let the water run over the area, massaging it to loosen and pull out the slime. Run a comb through it gently, as you don't want to yank hair out in the process. Rinse out the conditioner. Once the slime is mostly gone, run more warm water over the hair. Use your fingers to rinse the conditioner out of the hair. Massage shampoo into the hair. Apply shampoo to the area with your fingers, going the same direction as hair growth. The shampoo will help remove the last of the slime from the hair. Using Oil-Based Products Rub a dollop of oil into the hair. Apply the oil as you would shampoo, massaging it into the area with the slime. Use your fingers to work the oil fully into the hair, moving in the same direction as the hair growth. You can use any oil-heavy product, including mayonnaise, peanut butter, olive oil, vegetable oil, or coconut oil. You can even use baby oil. Comb the hair out with a fine-tooth comb.
