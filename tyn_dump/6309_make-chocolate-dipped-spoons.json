Pull out the bowl every 30 seconds to give the chocolate a light stir, to prevent the chocolate from burning or bubbling. When every chocolate chip has melted, stir the liquid chocolate until it is smooth with a wooden spoon. If you don't have a microwave, you can place the bowl on top of a boiling saucepan full of water to heat up the chocolate with hot steam. This works in the same way that heating fondue works. Be sure to completely cover the saucepan with the bowl to prevent steam from coming out of the edges."

If you accidentally dip one too far, use a wet paper towel to wipe away the excess chocolate from the handle. Be careful not to wipe the bowl of the spoon."

If you accidentally dip one too far, use a wet paper towel to wipe away the excess chocolate from the handle. Be careful not to wipe the bowl of the spoon. Cooling and Storing Spoons Lay wax paper on a cookie sheet and place the spoons face-down. Use a cookie sheet large enough to hold every spoon, and place each one face-down so it balances on the tip of the handle and the edge of the bowl. The curve of the spoon should be raised above the paper to minimize the amount of chocolate touching the wax paper. Refrigerate the chocolate spoons until the chocolate hardens completely.

Keep the spoons in a sealed container if you choose to store them in the freeze to keep the chocolate from drying out. Decorating and Accessorizing with Toppings Melt white and milk chocolate to drizzle over the spoons with a plastic bag. In two separate microwave-safe bowls melt the white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips in the microwave for about 2 to 3 minutes each in 30 second bursts, and stir the mix regularly. Pour the melted chips into separate small plastic bags. Cut a small hole in one corner of each plastic bag. Let the melted chocolate fall to one side of the plastic bag, and cut a small hole in the opposite, empty corner with scissors.
