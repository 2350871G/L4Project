    "text": " Making Garlic Parmesan Roasted Potatoes Preheat your oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and wash 2 lb (910 g) of potatoes. Hold each potato under cold running water in your kitchen sink. Scrub them lightly with a clean scouring pad to remove any dirt that\u2019s on them. Place your potatoes on or near your cutting surface right after you wash each one. Slice each potato in quarters with a vegetable knife. Slice a potato in half, then slice each half into another half. Continue cutting the potatoes this way until you\u2019ve cut all of them. As you finish quartering each potato, place the pieces in a large mixing bowl and set it aside. Peel and mince 3 cloves of garlic. Remove the outer skin from each clove of garlic by cutting the ends off of them and then using your fingers to peel the rough skin off. Use a sharp vegetable knife to cut the 3 peeled cloves into tiny pieces. The smaller you mince the garlic the better, as it will spread more evenly throughout your dish and give the dish more flavor. Set the minced garlic aside when you\u2019re done. Toss your potatoes in 3 US tbsp (44 mL) of olive oil. Add 3 US tbsp (44 mL) of olive oil to your bowl of quartered potatoes. Use clean hands to stir the potatoes and olive oil together until the potatoes are thoroughly coated in oil. Stir in the minced garlic and 2.5 oz (71 g) of Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle your minced garlic and 2.5 oz (71 g) of shredded Parmesan cheese into your bowl of potatoes and oil. Continue to stir the potatoes until the cheese and garlic are evenly spread throughout the bowl. Add 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Continue stirring your potato mixture as you add thyme, salt, and pepper. There\u2019s no exact amount of salt and pepper you should add; simply estimate how much you think it needs. Start with 2-3 dashes of each; it\u2019s better to go light on them than to add too much, since you can always add more later but you can\u2019t remove it if you add too much. Add more salt and pepper to the dish when it\u2019s done baking if you think it needs it, or to individual servings as desired. Bake the potatoes at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for 30-45 minutes.
