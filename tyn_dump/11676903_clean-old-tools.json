        "Check that the area isn\u2019t moist, and that your tools can receive plenty of dry, open air in the process.",
        "Soaking Rusty Tools in Vinegar Pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) of white vinegar into a large bucket.",
        "Find a large plastic container that\u2019s industrial-grade and won\u2019t wear down after holding acidic substances.",
        "Next, fill this bucket with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of white vinegar, so you can fully submerge and soak your tools.",
        "Additionally, set a large piece of wood aside that can be used to cover the bucket.If you\u2019re working with larger tools, consider filling a basin or tub with vinegar instead.",
        "In this case, you may need more than 1 gallon (3.8 L).",
        "If you don\u2019t want to use vinegar, you can also fill the bucket with warm water and dish soap.",
        "Soak your rusty tools in the vinegar for 4 hours.",
        "Arrange your rusted tools in the vinegar, checking that they\u2019re completely submerged as you go.",
        "Next, set a timer for 4 hours, so your tools have enough time to soak.",
        "To prevent any of the vinegar from evaporating, cover the bucket or basin with a large sheet of wood.If your tools are severely rusted, you might want to let them soak for 6-8 hours initially.",
        "Wipe away the rust with an abrasive pad.",
        "Remove the tools from the bucket after several hours of soaking, then arrange them on a flat, clean surface.",
        "Take an abrasive, coarse-grit pad and scrub at any rusty areas of the tool.",
        "As you remove the rust, switch a softer, fine-grit pad to buff the metal surface of your tools.Steel wool can also be a useful tool to remove rust.",
        "You can purchase abrasive pads or sandpaper at your local hardware store.",
        "Let the tools soak overnight to soften any remaining rust.",
        "If your scrubbing doesn\u2019t get rid of all the rust, try submerging your tools in white vinegar for a longer period of time.",
        "Leave the tools to soak overnight to soften the rust a bit more.",
        "Before you leave the area, place the wooden sheet over the bucket again so the vinegar stays covered.",
        "Scrub the rust again with an abrasive pad.",
        "The next day, remove your tools from the vinegar mixture once more and place them on a flat, clean surface.",
        "Use the same coarse-grit pad to work away any layers of rust.",
        "As you remove the rust, buff the surface of the tool with a softer pad, so the metal can look smooth and shiny.Depending on the severity of the rust, it might take a lot of elbow grease to get your tools clean again.",
        "Don\u2019t give up!",
        "Rinse and dry off the tools completely.",
        "Once the tools are completely clean, spray over them with a garden hose.",
        "Aim to clean off both sides of the tools, so their surfaces are free of vinegar.",
        "After they\u2019re fully clean, wipe down the tools with a clean rag to get rid of any excess moisture.",
        "Apply a layer of kerosene to the tool if the rust remains.",
        "Soak a rag with kerosene, then rub it over the metal surface of the tool.",
        "Rub both sides of the tool, so the metal is fully lubricated.",
        "Once you\u2019re finished using the kerosene rag, be sure to dispose of it safely.",
        "Rub away any rust with a wire-bristled wheel.",
        "Attach a wire-bristled brush or wheel to the drill bit, then power on your drill.",
        "Move the tool along the length of the metal surface to polish and buff the tool.",
        "Only use the brush on areas that you\u2019ve conditioned with kerosene, or else you may not be able to polish the metal properly.",
        "This process helps you to polish and buff the surface of your tools more effectively than an abrasive pad.",
        "Clean off any dust or rust with soft-grit sandpaper.",
        "Turn off your electrical drill, and scan the surface of your tool for any lingering specks of rust or dirt.",
        "Rub a sheet of smooth, fine-grit sandpaper over the metal surface with short, forceful movements to finish polishing the tool.",
        "Getting Rid of Rust with Oxalic Acid Put on protective glasses and gloves before working with the acid.",
        "Find a well-ventilated area where you can soak and clean your old tools without inhaling any acidic fumes.",
        "To protect your eyes, slip on a pair of safety goggles or glasses.",
        "Additionally, wear a pair of rubber gloves to prevent your hands from coming into contact with any acid.Try working in an outdoor area for this process.",
        "If you don\u2019t have enough room outside, set up a box fan in your workspace to keep the air moving.",
        "If your tools are severely rusted, you might want to use oxalic acid instead of white vinegar.",
        "Combine 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of oxalic acid with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.",
        "Fill a large, industrial-grade plastic bucket with water.",
        "Next, stir in a few spoonfuls of oxalic acid.",
        "Mix the ingredients together with a paint stirrer or other utensil to make sure that they\u2019re completely combined.",
        "Let your tools soak in the mixture for 20 minutes.",
        "Arrange the metal, rusty portions of your tools in the acidic solution, then set a timer for 20 minutes.",
        "If your tools are made entirely of metal, you can place the entire item in the bucket.",
        "If the items have wooden handles, only place the metal surface into the bucket.While oxalic acid isn\u2019t as potent as other acids, it\u2019s still a pretty strong substance.",
        "To prevent your wooden handles from getting degraded, try to keep them out of the solution altogether.",
        "Remove any stubborn portions of rust with a wire brush.",
        "With your protective gloves on, remove the tools from the bucket.",
        "If the rust hasn\u2019t soaked off completely, use coarse-grit sandpaper or a wire-bristled brush to scrub the surface of the tool.",
        "Apply an even amount of pressure, working in short, even strokes to remove the leftover rust.Continue wearing your protective eye gear during this part of the process.",
        "Rinse the tools off with clean, cool water.",
        "While wearing gloves, remove your older tools from the mixture and set them aside.",
        "Next, run the metal portion of each tool under cool running water to get rid of any lingering acid.",
        "Once the tools are rinsed, you can set them aside on a flat, clean surface.If you don\u2019t rinse off the extra acid, it could do long-term damage to your tools.",
        "Soak the clean tools in a mixture of baking soda and water for 10 minutes.",
        "Pour at least 4 tablespoon (59.1 ml) (58 g) of baking soda into a bucket or basin filled with 5 litres (21  c) of water, then stir the ingredients together.",
