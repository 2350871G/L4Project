Shake the Tupperware and fine dirt particles will stick to the sides. Roll the Dorodango on this. Repeat 11 until the dorodango feels powdery. Then put it in another bag. Repeat 11 as many times as you can, the more you do it the better your ball comes out.  Let it dry for at least 20 minutes.  Get a very soft cloth, and slowly begin to rub the dorodango.
