                    "description": "Although rubber cement, cement and even flour can be used to make a fossil mould, plaster of Paris is the recommended choice of material, as it's cheap and designed to be easy to use. If you're planning on presenting your fossil outdoors however, cement will increase the durability. A 4.5lb box is approximately $5, and will offer you more plaster than you'll ever need for your fossilizing needs. Harder materials like cement aren't recommended for proper mixing bowls. Use a bowl you think is completely expendable. A combination of flour with other materials like salt and coffee grounds can be used as well to a similar effect."

Although exact measurements are not necessary, you can use measuring cups from your kitchen for this step. For most fossils, two cups of plaster and one cup water should give you all the mould you need. Double this recipe if your fossil objects are bigger and need more space. If the plaster you purchased indicates it needs a different proportion of water, you should go with its recommendation. Certain brands and types of plaster may have individual preferences."

By the end, the mixture should be thick and goopy without having excess plaster powder visible in the mix. This is your chance to troubleshoot your mixture if there are any problems. If the mixture doesn't seem semi-solid and thick, add more plaster. If some of the plaster isn't joining the mixture, add water."
