Open the jaws of the calipers wide enough so you can put the screw between them. Tighten the jaws around the main shaft of the screw, but not on the threading, which is the raised area that rotates around the screw. Read the measurement on the side of the calipers to know the diameter of the screw\u2019s shaft. You can buy calipers from your local hardware store.

        "Scrape off any excess putty with the knife and return it to the container.",
        "You can buy wood putty from your local hardware store.",
        "You will not be able to remove the screw if you cover it with putty.",
        "Only use putty if you want the screw to be permanent.",
        "Let the wood putty dry for up to 8 hours.",
        "Leave the putty in a cool, dry place so it has time to set.",
        "The time it takes for your putty to dry depends on how much you use and how deep the hole is, but it usually takes around 6-8 hours for it to fully harden.",
        "Try touching it with your finger to see if any lifts up or still feels tacky to the touch.",
        "Some wood putties come with a hardening agent to help promote faster drying.",
        "Mix the hardening agent with the putty before you apply it for it to take effect.",
        "Sand the putty with 120-grit sandpaper until it\u2019s flush with the rest of the wood.",
        "Rub the surface of the wood in circular or back-and-forth strokes to smooth out any raised or bumpy areas.",
        "Change which direction you sand the wood often so the surface looks even.",
        "Wipe away any sawdust and run your hand over the wood to check if it feels level.",
        "You can use an electric sander to speed up the process if you want, but it\u2019s not required.",
        "If you do, wear a dust mask so you don\u2019t breathe any sawdust.",
        "Paint or stain the wood to help conceal the putty.",
        "The putty may have a slightly different color than the rest of the wood once it dries.",
        "If you want to make the wood look like it\u2019s a single solid piece, coat the surface with a thin layer of paint or stain to change the color of the wood.",
        "As the wood and putty absorb the color, you won\u2019t be able to see the area where you put the screw anymore."
