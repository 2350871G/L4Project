Reduce the heat and simmer the sauce for 15 to 20 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium or lower, so the sauce bubbles gently. Stir the sauce occasionally and let it simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water. Measure 1 tablespoon (9 g) of cornstarch into a small prep bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of cold water until the cornstarch dissolves into a slurry. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the sauce. Turn the heat to medium-low and slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the eel sauce. Keep whisking to prevent lumps of cornstarch from forming.
