        "Remove the mixture from heat, let it cool, then whisk in 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of oil.",
        "You can use just one type of oil or a combination of two different types.",

        "This will make it easier to whip later on.",
        "Whisk the mixture until it is light and fluffy.",
        "Take the bowl out of the fridge, and whisk the mixture together.",

        "Refrigerate the mixture for half an hour.",
        "This will set the mixture to its final consistency and make it more cream like.",
        "Use a rubber spatula to transfer the cream to a glass jar, and store it in a cool, dry place away from sunlight.",

        "This will create the base for your moisturizer.",
        "Whisk in \u00bc cup (55 grams) of coconut oil.",
        "Keep stirring until the coconut oil melts and gets evenly mixed into the melted beeswax.",
        "Coconut oil is naturally moisturizing, but some people find that it clogs pores.",

        "Wait for the moisturizer to cool before using it.",
        "Store it in a cool, dry place, out of reach of sunlight, and use it within 6 months.",
        "Making an Anti-Aging Moisturizer Whip 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of shea butter in a bowl until it turns creamy.",
