        "However, most jeans fit lower.",
        "Check your inseam by measuring your leg length from the crotch down.",
        "With your legs shoulder-width apart, measure from your foot to your crotch on the inside of your leg.",
        "If you need to, ask someone you trust to help you.",
        "Measure from where you like your jeans to fall on your foot.",
        "You'll see this measurement often, especially in men's sizes.",
        "For instance, if you like your jeans a bit long, measure from the bottom of your foot.",
        "Try not to bend to read the measurement.",
        "Instead, use a mirror or mark with the finger holding the measuring tape.",
        "If you're struggling to hold the measuring tape in place, try using adhesive tape to secure one end to your ankle while you hold the other at your crotch.",
        "Get your hip measurement by measuring around your hips.",
        "Some jeans will also have this measurement.",
        "Wrap the tape measure around your hips where they are the widest.",
        "Make sure the tape measure isn't lifting up or drooping in the back.",
        "You won't see this measurement as often, but you can still use it if you're measuring jeans before trying them on.",
        "Take your thigh measurement around one thigh.",
        "Wrap the tape measure around your skin where your thighs are the thickest.",
        "Only take a measurement for one thigh; you don't need to do both.",
        "If one is slightly thicker, take the measurement for that thigh.",
        "This measurement also isn't very common.",
        "Try not to pull your measuring tape too tight or you can give yourself an inaccurate thigh measurement and wind up in an uncomfortable pair of jeans.",
        "The tape should be snug, but you should still be able to slip one finger underneath.",
        "Check your front rise from your crotch to your belly button.",
        "Stretch a tape measure from just behind your crotch line up and over the front of your pelvis to your waist.",
        "For women, this is around the belly button; for men, usually an inch or two or a couple of centimeters below.",
        "It can be helpful to wear a belt for the front rise measurement to give yourself an indication of where your jean waist would lie.",
        "You won't see this measurement as much, but sometimes stores use it to define how high or low the jeans sit.",
        "If you need to measure the back rise, do the same thing going the opposite direction.",
        "Use your measurements to find a pair of jeans using size charts.",
        "In women's jeans, look at the waist, which will be the best indicator of size.",
        "You may also use the inseam measurement.",
        "For men, you'll use both the length and waist measurement when finding a size on a size chart.",
        "Note that sizes may run a little small or large, so it's always best to check the actual chart.",
        "When shopping online, use the brand's size chart to find a good fit for that brand.",

        "A low-rise jean will sit 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) below your belly button.",
        "Mid-rise jeans fall just below your belly button, while high-rise sits closer to the natural waist, at your belly button or a bit above.",
        "If you need to, take a waist measurement where you prefer your jeans to fall.",
        "Measure jeans in the store before you try them on.",
        "If you hate trying jeans on, use a tape measure to check out the jeans first.",
        "Match them up to your measurements to help you find pairs that will fit.",
        "If you can't find a perfect match, choose jeans that are slightly bigger.",

        "You won't have as many pairs to try on, so the process will go faster.",
        "Each pair of jeans will also feel a little bit different, particularly if some have stretch in them while others do not.",

        "Kathi Burns, CPO\u00ae\t\t\tImage Consultant\t\t\t\tTake a friend with you when you're shopping for jeans.",
        "When you try on jeans, having a friend can help because they'll be able to see how the jeans fit you in the back.",
        "You're not going to be able to tell how well those jeans are working just by twisting around to look in the mirror.",
        "Study size charts and descriptions when buying online to find the right size.",
        "Most online stores have size charts where you can check out exactly what each of their sizes mean.",
        "Plus, many stores will also have size descriptions on the product page, which may include the hip measurement and the front rise measurement, so you can get a clearer idea of what you're buying.",
        "Always be aware of vanity sizing, as you may not be the same size at every store.",
        "Don't worry so much about the \"correct\" size.",
        "Focus on finding the right measurements.",
        "That holds true for men's sizes, too, which in theory are \"measured\" but can also fall prey to different sizes across stores.",
        "Learn the brands that fit you well so you don't need to measure as often.",
        "Some brands will always run smaller or larger, so it can be helpful to take note of what brands fit you best.",
        "Also, keep notes on what brands run true to size and which ones don't.",
        "For instance, one site ranked these brands on a scale, with the first one being closest to true size up to the last one, which was much larger than true size: H&M, Calvin Klein, Alfani, Gap, Haggar, Dockers, Old Navy.",
        "If you're shopping for jeans online, read customer feedback and reviews to get a sense for how the pants fit, such as if they run large or small.",
        "You may also want to consider buying from retailers with generous return policies for online sales so you can trade them in for another pair if you need to.",
        "Buy jeans slightly smaller if you think they will stretch.",
        "Unless they shrink in the wash, most pairs of jeans are at their tightest the first time you wear them.",
        "With the stresses from repeated wearing, most jeans loosen up slightly over time, becoming more comfortable to wear.",
        "If a pair of jeans feels just just a bit too tight when you try them on, you may be able to get away with wearing them in the long run.",
        "Consider having your pants tailored for a better fit.",
        "If you're not happy with the fit of your jeans, having them tailored can make them fit perfectly.",
        "Find a nearby tailor who can make some adjustments, which often costs less than buying a bespoke pair of jeans."
