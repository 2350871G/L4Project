Place a small amount of waterproofing agent on a clean, dry rag and gently buff it into the leather using small circular motions. Continue buffing until the product you applied has disappeared into the material. Method Two: Alternate Hand Washing Option Remove heavy surface stains with alcohol. For surface stains that cannot be scrubbed away with a cloth, like ink stains, rub the stain with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol. Many surface stains, like grease stains, will be removed when you clean the entire surface of the bag with soap and water later on.
