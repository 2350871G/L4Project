Using What You Have Try using what you have at home. You don't have to make a secret cubby to hide your candy. You can use what you have in your room, such as a sock drawer or tissue box. This section will give you a few ideas on where you can hide candy in your room. Hide your candy in the bottom of a tissue box. Find a tissue box, then carefully lift out the entire stack of tissues. Place your candy in a thin layer along the bottom, then place the stack of tissues back. Pull out the first tissue\u2014this will make it look like the tissues are \"in use.\" Try hiding your candy inside your pillowcase.

If it is winter, hide the candy in one of your summer shirts. Another great hiding spot is inside of a pair of socks. Coat pockets make great hiding places too! Keep the candy in a small box on top of your bookshelf. Push the box towards the back of the shelf, against the wall. This will keep the box out of sight. Hide candy inside magazine folders. It would be best to use folders that you are currently using. That way, the folders will look like they are only being used for magazines. Camouflage the candy. Candy and toys are both brightly-colored. If you have a bin where you keep lots of small, plastic toys, you can hide some small, brightly-colored candies in the bottom of that bin. The bright colors of your toys will help camouflage the bright colors of the candy. Avoiding Detection Throw the wrappers away outside your home. If you have a trashcan in your room or home, don't throw the wrappers away in that. If someone sees candy wrappers in the trashcan, they will suspect that you are hiding candy in your room. Instead, throw the candy away at school. Don't brag. If you brag about hiding candy in your room, someone may go looking for it. If you have any siblings, it might be a good idea to keep your candy stash secret from them. If they get mad at you, they may tell on you.

        "If you have a trashcan in your room or home, don't throw the wrappers away in that.",
        "If someone sees candy wrappers in the trashcan, they will suspect that you are hiding candy in your room.",
        "Instead, throw the candy away at school.",
        "Don't brag.",
        "If you brag about hiding candy in your room, someone may go looking for it.",
        "If you have any siblings, it might be a good idea to keep your candy stash secret from them.",
        "If they get mad at you, they may tell on you.",
        "They may also get careless and accidentally give your secret away.",
        "Act natural.",
        "Don't get nervous, especially if someone is close to one of your hiding spots.",
        "For example, if someone opens the sock drawer where you hid your candy, don't scream \"Don't open that!\"",
        "or \"Don't look in there!\"",
        "This will tell the other person that you are hiding something, and they will get suspicious and look through your sock drawer.",
        "Don't draw attention to your candy stash.",
        "People tend to look where other people are looking.",
        "If someone is with you in your room, and you keep looking at your secret stash, the other person may get curious.",
        "They may even try to look wherever you are looking and find your candy.",
        "Don't hide your candy in places that other people go through often.",
        "For example, if someone does your laundry for you, don't hide your candy in your dresser, wardrobe, or closet.",
        "Another example would be a toy bin or a bookshelf that both you and a sibling use.",
        "Rotate your hiding places.",
        "The longer something sits in one place, the more likely someone will find it sooner or later.",
        "If you plan on hiding the candy in your room, plan on changing the hiding places at least once a week.",
        "If there are lots of people going through your room, you might even want to change the hiding places every day.",
        "Making a Faux Book Cubby Choose a box that will fit on your bookshelf.",
        "A shoe box might be a little too big, but those cardboard boxes that snacks and granola bars would be perfect.",
        "You can also use a small, wooden box instead.",
        "Find a picture online of some book spines.",
        "You can choose any types of books you want, but it might be a good idea to use books that you might find on your shelf.",
        "For example, if you have a lot of new books, a set of dusty, leather-bound books might look out of place.",
        "You can also stack some of your own books together, then photocopy their spines.",
        "Use an image editor to make them the same width as your box.",
        "Measure your box first and write that number down.",
        "Open up your picture in an image-editing program.",
        "Change the canvas size until the width matches up with the number you wrote down.",
        "Print the image out.",
        "Try to get good-quality print out.",
        "You can use plain, old printer paper for this.",
        "Glue the paper to a sheet of thin cardboard.",
        "Find a sheet of thin cardboard\u2014an old cereal box would work great for this.",
        "Next, cover the cardboard with a thin layer of glue.",
        "It might be a good idea to paint the glue on with a paintbrush.",
        "If you use too much glue, your paper will get soggy.",
        "If you are using a cereal box, cut out the front or back first, then put the glue on the cardboard side.",
        "The image size will be on the back from now on.",
        "Place the picture on top of the glue.",
        "Use your fingers or the edge of a ruler to smooth it out.",
        "Wait for the glue to dry before you move on.",
        "Cut the spines out.",
        "The picture you printed out will probably have a white background, or the background of a bookshelf.",
        "For this project, you want just the spines and no background.",
        "Use a pair of scissors to cut your image out of the cardboard.",
        "Follow the top edges of the spines as best as your can.",
        "If you are very careful, you can also use a craft knife.",
        "Be sure to work on top of a cutting mat, and to cut away from yourself.",
        "Glue the cardboard to the side of your box.",
        "Cover the side of your box with a thin layer of glue first.",
        "Next, place the cardboard cutout on top of the glue.",
        "Make sure that bottom and side edges of your cardboard cutout match up with the bottom and side edges of your box.",
        "Fill your box with candy, then slide it between two books on your bookshelf.",
        "This cubby not only acts as a storage for your secret candy stash and hold bigger candy, but it also doubles-up as a nifty bookend!"
