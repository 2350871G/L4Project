The dollar amount is always written out as words, and the cent amount written as a fraction out of 100. This is because there are 100 cents in a dollar, so if the check amount includes 45 cents, it is 45/100 of a dollar. While this is the basic rule, there are a few different ways to format the actual content of the line. Written dollar amount + \u201cand\u201d + fractional cent amount: forty-seven and 50/100. Written dollar amount + \u201cdollars and\u201d + fractional cent amount: forty-seven dollars and 50/100.
