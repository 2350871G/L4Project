                    "description": "Purchase a suede brush from a home supply or auto parts store. A suede brush has rubber bristles on it that won\u2019t put too much pressure on the suede or alcantara. Perform a standard cleaning at least once a week to ensure that skin cells, dirt, and dust don\u2019t build up in the fabric of your steering wheel over time. This is a simple process that can be completed in 5-10 minutes. Keep the brush in your glove box to make this process easier whenever you remember to clean the steering wheel. Some suede brushes come with a rubber eraser designed for suede. This eraser is typically better for flatter surfaces where the entire side of the eraser can stay in contact with the suede as you use it. If your wheel is really dirty, put a clean towel in your lap when you sit in the seat to clean it."

Move the brush back and forth rapidly to knock up the dust and dirt trapped in the fabric. Cover a 3\u20136 in (7.6\u201315.2 cm) section 5-10 times before moving on to another part of the wheel. Do this when your vehicle isn\u2019t running so that the wheel doesn\u2019t move as you brush. Keep your door open while doing this to avoid trapping the dust and dirt you knock up inside of your vehicle."

Move the rubber bristles back and forth 5-10 times before moving to a new section.Tip: It can be kind of awkward to brush the backside of the steering wheel.

Get a brush with soft bristles; don\u2019t get one of those brushes designed for industrial machine cleaning. So long as your brush has soft bristles and you aren\u2019t scrubbing the wheel hard, it\u2019s fine to do this every week. This is more cosmetic than anything.
