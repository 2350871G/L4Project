Make sure your container is free of debris by rinsing it out. Do not use tap water. Tap water is safe to drink, but not entirely sterile and can contain microorganisms that are harmful to the eye. Rinse out your contact lens container with solution, not water. Either wipe the case dry with a clean, lint-free towel or let it air dry. Air drying is preferable, as it reduces the chance of spreading bacteria or debris into the case. Contact lens cases should only be used for three months before being discarded. Keep track of how long you've had your case."

                    "description": "Before you remove your contacts, or do anything else that involves touching your eye, you should always thoroughly wash and dry your hands. Debris or bacteria you've had contact with throughout the day can lead to eye infection. Get your hands wet with tap water. While people often encourage the use of warm water, temperature is a matter of personal preference. Warm or cold is fine. The soap you use to wash your hands before removing your contacts should be pH neutral and contain little oil or fragrance. Lather your hands, making sure to get between your fingers and the back of your hands. As you'll be touching your eyes directly, pay special attention to washing your finger tips and under your nails. Scrub your hands under running water for at least 20 seconds. In order to keep track of time, you can hum the \"Happy Birthday\" song to yourself twice. Rinse your hands. Be particularly careful about removing all soap, as soap can irritate your eyes. If possible, air dry your hands before handling contact lenses to avoid getting lint trapped in your eyes. If that's not an option, use paper towel as it's less likely to leave debris on your hands. If you have one, it might be a good idea to use a nail brush. As you'll be having such close contact with your eyes, you want to make sure all debris is safely removed."
