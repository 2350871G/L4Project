        "Replace the milk with water, almond milk, or soy milk for a vegan muffin.",
        "You'll also need to replace the butter on the pan, but olive or canola oil will cover this easily.",
        "These muffins have all the flavor of a normal English muffin, especially if you use a milk substitute instead of just water."
