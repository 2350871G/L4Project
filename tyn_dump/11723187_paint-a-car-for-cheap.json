Otherwise, you should fill in scratches and cover any exposed metal with an auto body primer. You can use a spray-on or liquid primer. Either way, let the primer dry completely before you do anything else. If you use spray-on primer, spray a liberal coat of primer over the scratches or exposed metal until those areas are completely covered and filled in. For liquid primer, use foam brushes to paint the primer in an even coat over any scratched or exposed areas. It can take the primer several hours to fully dry, so try to start your project early in the morning if you\u2019ll be applying primer. Auto body primer can be found at any hardware store for around $5-10.Warning: Wear a respirator whenever you\u2019re priming, sanding, or painting so you\u2019re not inhaling fumes or dust particles while you work."

        "Work your way around your car until you\u2019ve painted the entire surface.",
        "When one spray can runs empty, grab a new one and keep going.",
        "Wear a respirator while you work so you\u2019re not inhaling paint fumes.Tip: You should only need to apply one coat as long as you make sure the first coat is opaque and uniform.",
        "Take your time and periodically check for any spots you may have missed.",
        "Polish off any overspray with acetone and a rag.",
        "If you get any paint on a section of your car you didn\u2019t mean to, it should come right off with acetone.",
        "Just pour some acetone onto a clean rag and buff the paint stain with it.",
        "Walk around your car and check for any overspray and wipe it off with the rag before it dries.",
        "Be careful not to touch any paint that you don\u2019t want to remove with the acetone or it will come right off.",
        "If that happens, just spray some more paint onto that spot.",
        "Let your car dry for 24 hours.",
        "The paint will start to feel dry after a few hours, but it will take a full 24 hours to fully dry.",
        "Keep your car parked in a sheltered area, like a garage, until it\u2019s fully dry so the paint job doesn\u2019t get damaged.",
        "Once your car is fully dry, you can peel off any painter\u2019s tape and newspaper.",
        "Painting with Rollers and Brushes Get a few buckets of Rust-Oleum Protective Enamel Brush-On Paint.",
        "It\u2019s available in blue, green, yellow, red, brown, gray, aluminum, white, sand, almond, and black, and you can get it in different finishes, like gloss, satin, and flat.",
        "Go with gloss paint for the most professional-looking finish.",
        "Rust-Oleum Protective Enamel Brush-On Paint is designed to cover outdoor metal surfaces that are susceptible to rust, but it also works as an affordable car paint.",
        "It\u2019s durable and can produce a smooth, glossy, high-quality finish.",
        "Get 2-3 buckets of paint to start out with.",
        "You may need more or less depending on the size of your car and how many coats you do.",
        "Buckets should cost around $10-20 each at a hardware store.",
        "Thin your paint with mineral spirits so it goes on smoother.",
        "Pour half a pint of paint into a paint measuring cup and add 4 capfuls of mineral spirits.",
        "Thoroughly stir everything together, then lift your stirring stick out of the cup and watch the paint flow off of it.",
        "You\u2019ll know it\u2019s a good consistency if the paint flows for about 4 seconds before it starts to drip.",
        "If the paint is too thick, add more mineral spirits.",
        "If it\u2019s too thin, add more paint.",
        "Thinning the paint first will help it roll onto the surface of your car more smoothly, and it prevents roller marks from showing up in the paint.",
        "Don\u2019t make the paint too thin though, or it will just pour off the surface you\u2019re painting and make a mess.",
        "Apply the paint to your car with a 4 in (10 cm) foam roller.",
        "Pour the thinned paint into a paint tray and cover your foam roller with it.",
        "Then, paint as much of your car as you can with the roller.",
        "Move the roller up and down and back and forth to cover the old finish with paint, working on one panel at a time.",
        "Keep painting until you have a smooth, even coat over all of the reachable surfaces of your car.",
        "Keep pouring more thinned paint into the paint tray as you run out.",
        "If you run out of thinned paint, open a new bucket of unthinned paint and mix it with mineral spirits.",
        "Use a foam paintbrush to paint hard-to-reach nooks and crannies.",
        "Dip a small foam paintbrush into the thinned paint and use it to fill in any areas you weren\u2019t able to reach with the foam roller.",
        "A foam paintbrush shouldn\u2019t leave any brush strokes in the paint, and it will be easy to maneuver in hard-to-reach places.",
        "You can find foam paintbrushes at a hardware or craft store.",
        "Wait 6 hours and apply a second coat if needed.",
        "You may be satisfied with how your car looks after one coat.",
        "Otherwise, let the first coat dry for 6 hours, then apply a second coat the same way you applied the first one.",
        "Start with the foam roller, and then fill in the details with a foam brush.",
        "Don\u2019t wait longer than 6 hours to apply another coat.",
        "If you do, the paint will cure and you\u2019ll have to wet sand it before applying another coat.",
        "You can apply more than 2 coats if needed.",
        "Just wait 6 hours between each coat, or wet sand the car after each coat if you have to wait longer between coats.",
        "Give your car 24 hours to dry before using it.",
        "You may be able to touch the paint without it coming off within a few hours, but it will take 24 hours to completely dry.",
        "Move your car into a sheltered area if it\u2019s not already so nothing damages the paint while it\u2019s drying.",
        "Once the paint is dry, take off the painter's tape and newspaper you applied earlier."
