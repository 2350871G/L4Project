If you have an Asian azalea shrub, it could be one of two main evergreen varieties:\nKurume hybrids are usually bright red and don't tend to grow very large - no more than 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m). They do well with some maintenance pruning, but they may never need much pruning at all.

Take note that when you're picking out azaleas to plant, choosing a Kurume instead of a Southern Indian will be your best bet if you don't want to worry as much about maintenance."
