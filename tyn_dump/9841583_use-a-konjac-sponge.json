Once it stops expanding, it will be ready to use. Your Konjac sponge may need to soak for as long as 20 minutes to fully soften if it\u2019s your first time using it.

Konjac is super absorbent, so it will hold and disperse skincare products as well as any regular sponge to give your skin that freshly-cleaned feeling. Due to its small size, the sponge may lose most of its lather after a few minutes of continuous scrubbing. You may need to add more cleanser if you\u2019re going over larger areas, like your chest, back, or legs. Talk to your dermatologist before using a Konjac sponge to apply retinoids or other medicated products."
