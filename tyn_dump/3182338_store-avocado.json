Unripe avocados are a brighter shade of green and have a smoother skin. Inspect the look and feel of the avocado. Then, try gently squeezing it. If the fruit has a little give and isn\u2019t firm, it\u2019s ripe. Unripe avocados will be hard and difficult to squeeze.Tip: Squeezing an avocado can bruise it. If you want to minimize the impact of bruising while you\u2019re testing it, press your avocado near the stem. Once an avocado is ripe, it should be consumed within 1-2 days. A ripe avocado will feel similar to a ripe orange when you squeeze it. An unripe avocado may resemble a baseball or apple in terms of firmness."

Fold the top of the bag over itself to partially seal the bag. As the fruit ripens, a chemical called ethylene is released.

The temperature of your home should be 65\u201375 \u00b0F (18\u201324 \u00b0C) if you want your avocado to ripen evenly. If you aren\u2019t in a rush and don\u2019t mind waiting for a while, you can simply leave it out on the counter. It will take 2-3 days for an avocado to ripen in a paper bag. Without the paper bag, it will take 3-5 days for the avocado to ripen. Some people claim that adding an apple or banana to the bag will speed up the ripening process.

        "Packaging a Cut Avocado Set your sliced avocado out on a cutting board or paper towel.",
