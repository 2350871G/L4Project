Check the retailer's website or contact them to make sure they quarantine their fish after importing them for at least 1-2 weeks. This primarily applies to fish retailers that have their fish imported. If the fish retailer breeds their own inventory, they may not need to quarantine them. Avoid fish retailers that do not quarantine their inventory, as an ill fish could spread diseases to your other fish and potentially kill them. Don't forget to quarantine the fish you receive for 14 before putting them in with other fish you have. Observe them for any illness that crop up after the stress of shipping."

Research each fish's specific needs and ensure you can provide the right habitat for each of them. Find out the water requirements, diet, size, and lifespan of each creature and make sure you can care for them well. You could, for example, buy a green spotted puffer fish or freshwater sting ray, as both of these species are difficult to find. If you're buying multiple fish online, purchase them at the same time to cut back on shipping costs.
