Punch the holes, then lift the template away. Repeat this step for the back cover. Assembling the Book Stack everything together. Place the back cover face-down. Stack the paper on top. Place the front cover on top, face-up. At this point, you can also insert other items into your book, such as folders and sticker sheets. Use binder clips to hold everything together. Tap the stack against the table first to make sure that everything is aligned, especially the holes. Place binder clips along the top, bottom, and right-side edge.

How many times you wrap the wire around the pen depends on how many holes you have. If you have 24 holes, wrap it 24 times. Trim off the excess wire with wire cutters.
