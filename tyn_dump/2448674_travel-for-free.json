Share background information about the importance of the cause you are volunteering, as well as what the effort means to you personally. Don\u2019t just rely on text or images \u2013 a highly compelling video can really make your campaign stand out from all the rest! Finding Jobs that Let You Travel for Free Look for full-time or part-time jobs that offer travel opportunities as a recruiting tool. Many firms have begun to attract top talent by offering paid travel along with vacation time. Others involve travel as a part of the nature of the work. Work on a yacht or cruise ship crew if you have culinary, mechanical, or navigational skills. Look online for job opportunities or head to the marina in the nearest port town to look for ads. Take nursing assignments in other regions or even abroad if you have a nursing degree. In cities and countries across the globe, there are shortages of qualified nursing professionals. Some hospitals and healthcare facilities offer enticing recruitment packages, including relocation expenses, for qualified nurses. Help car owners relocate their cars to other parts of the country. There are firms, like Auto Driveaway, that connect drivers with owners, allowing you to see the country on the road while earning a little cash on the side. Become an influencer in the travel space by blogging. You should know that doing so is hard work, involving regular writing, photography/videography, social networking, and digital advertising. The more popular your blog becomes the more likely it is that you will be offered free travel opportunities by tourism and hospitality firms. Keep in mind that growing your presence this much is not a hobby \u2013 it\u2019s a business. Studying to Travel for Free Apply for a travel scholarship. If you are a current college student, you may be able to find scholarships or exchange programs that allow you to travel for free for a semester or two. Some programs require you to pay part of the expense, but if your academic record is strong enough, you may be able to apply for a scholarship or grant that pays your way there and allows you to stay for free at a sister university. Enroll in an undergraduate or graduate program overseas. In addition to semester-long programs, you may want to consider completing your entire college program overseas. If you\u2019re in high school, carefully research overseas college programs and discuss this possibility with your parents. You may want to spend a year or two at a college in your home country, and after you\u2019ve had a couple of years of living and studying on your own, transfer to a program abroad to complete your degree. Keep your grades high to maximize your chances of getting a scholarship to cover the costs. If you\u2019re applying for a graduate program and working for a multinational corporation, you may be eligible to have your company cover the costs of a part-time graduate program overseas, provided you work full-time in their office overseas. Usually companies who agree to do this also have you sign a contract indicating you\u2019ll work for them for a certain period after you graduate, as well as maintain a certain minimum grade point average throughout the duration of the program. You\u2019ll want to discuss such opportunities thoroughly with your HR department. Plan educational trips for your students if you\u2019re a teacher. Many travel companies will cover the educator\u2019s expenses, or split them with the school district or university, while the parents or students will cover their own costs.",
