Genograms are like family trees. Only in addition to looking at the branches, you also look at the leaves on each branch. You'll not only learn who is in your family, but how everyone is connected through physical and emotional relationships. For example, a genogram can tell you who is married, divorced, widowed, etc. It will also tell you how many kids each union (typically between two individuals) has, what each child is like, and what the individual relationships are between members on more than just a physical level. Think about what kind of information you want to learn from making your genogram. Do you want to know who in your family has depression, addictions, or a history of cancer? Perhaps you want to know more about why your mother and her mother never get along, by looking for the right clues you\u2019ll be able to make a genogram that serves your goals."

        "Women are indicated by a circle.",
        "When indicating a marriage, position the female symbol to the right.",
        "A single horizontal line indicates marriage and two slanted lines separation.",
        "The oldest child is always below and to the left of his family, whereas the youngest should be below and to the right.",
        "Other available symbols help you describe family events such as pregnancy or miscarriage, illnesses and deaths.",
        "There is even a diamond symbol to represent pets.",
        "Organize the chart based on family interactions beginning with the oldest generation you want to represent at the top.",
        "For example, you may decide to start your genogram with your grandparents or even your great grandparents.",
        "Genograms can be used to show the diversity in family relationships as well as patterns of illnesses.",
        "A genogram includes symbols to indicate family interactions such as conflict, closeness, estrangement, etc.",
        "Emotional relationships have specific symbols that help keep the flow of the genogram clear.",
        "There are also symbols that denote sexual and physical abuse as well as mental and physical disorders.",
        "Look for patterns.",
        "Once you've made the genogram, look carefully to see what patterns can be identified.",
        "There may be hereditary patterns or particular psychological tendencies that are very noticeable when grouped together in this way.",
        "Be careful about making assumptions.",
        "The data is one thing, but avoid using it to confirm that your family has a particular disease, or mental issue.",
        "Talk to a medical professional about any potential for hereditary problems of this type.",
        "Avoid using the genogram to make assumptions about the motivations of family members as well, or using this to confront them.",
        "While you might find your aunt has a tendency to quit every job she has ever had while your cousin has always seemed to steal other people's boyfriends, it's not a good idea to use the genogram to \"prove\" your point that a family member needs psychoanalysis.",
        "Be very careful to avoid approaching your family members in a judgmental way as a result of making a genogram; talk to your family or personal counselor before proceeding to reach conclusions from a self-generated genogram.",
        "If you're writing up the family history, patterns established in a genogram can be very helpful as a way of explaining why ancestral family members left one geographical area for another, what sorts of relationship issues members had and may help to unearth other family members who were not officially recognized."
