The steel should be 2,100 to 2,200 \u00b0F (1,150 to 1,200 \u00b0C) which is a straw or yellow color. Forge the blade to a point so that the flat side will be your blade edge and the curved side will be your spine when finished.  Leave room for a tang (the part in the handle). Leave about two inches or more on one end. Establish a blade, by repeating rows of small taps with a three pound sledge (best weight will depend on your size and strength) in long rows up the blade, narrowing the steel making the distal taper. Work on both sides of the blade to prevent it from distorting. Hammer out the flat side to make the bevels. Note that doing so will cause the blade to bend back on the spine. Try to keep the blade from mushrooming or bending over itself, as this will cause inclusions weakening the blade.  Remember, when it is a rough blade shape, you can anneal it by bringing it to this red hot nonmagnetic temperature three times and letting it air cool till all the red is gone. After the third heating, let it cool in the fire overnight. Cooling it very slowly will make it softer, easier to file. File to shape and even up any uneven spots.
