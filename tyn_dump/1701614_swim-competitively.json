        "\u201cParent and child\u201d water classes or other less structured swimming sessions might be suitable for younger children, though.",
        "Watch for signs of burnout due to overemphasis on competition.",
        "Some kids thrive in a competitive atmosphere from a young age, and their love of swimming will only grow over time.",
        "Others, however, find that the relentless focus on doing more training laps and doing them faster turns their love of swimming into dread.",
        "If a child starts making excuses about why they don\u2019t want to go to practices or meets, or just seems generally unhappy about swimming, they may be dealing with burnout.",
        "The child might need to take a break from competitive swimming, or find a program that places less emphasis on competition.",
        "Promote a healthy body image and a healthy lifestyle.",
        "Kids who don\u2019t naturally fit the long, lean body type of Olympic champion swimmers might feel inadequate or want to take unhealthy measures to change their body.",
        "Remind them that swimmers, like people in general, come in all shapes and sizes, and remind them that their focus should be on fitness, fun, and giving their best effort.",
        "Make sure child swimmers eat a healthy diet full of healthy carbs, lean proteins, and lots of fruits and veggies, and that they drink water regularly.",
        "Support the child\u2019s goals instead of imposing your own.",
        "Trying to turn a child into the champion swimmer you wanted to be is one of the quickest ways to cause burnout.",
        "Talk to the child regularly about what their goals are for competitive swimming, and validate these goals with your support and encouragement.",
        "Swimming competitively can teach lifelong lessons about the importance of dedication, focus, and fitness.",
        "But these lessons won\u2019t be learned if a child comes to despise being in the pool."
