Using A Balloon Gather your materials. For this method, you will need a clean round container like a coffee can or formula can, balloons, electrical tape or masking tape, and rubber bands (optional).

Using a marker, draw around the can. Then, move the can over and draw around the can again. These circles are going to be the top and bottom parts of the drum. Cut out the circles, leaving 2 inches (5.1 cm) of space between the drawn line and your cut. This will give you extra leather to thread with rope. Use the scissors to make small snips around the outside of both pieces of leather. These snips will be used to thread the rope around the drum. Thread the rope through the holes. Once you have thread the rope through the holes on the top piece and the bottom piece of leather, tie it off with a small knot and cut away the excess rope. Place the leather pieces on either end of the can. Then, thread the rope from top to bottom using the threaded rope on the leather pieces, tightening as you go. Test out the drum.
