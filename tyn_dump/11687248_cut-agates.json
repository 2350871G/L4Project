Remove any blade that is currently fitted in the power saw and replace it with a diamond-tipped saw blade.Tip: Use a saw blade that is thicker than 0.006 in (0.015 cm) for the safest option. Diamond-tip blades that are at least this thick can\u2019t easily cut into your fingers. This method works well to cut large agates that you can easily hold on both sides in order to feed it into the bandsaw or table saw. A bandsaw utilizes a long skinny saw blade on a band that rotates around and through a work table, whereas a table saw has a round spinning saw blade mounted in the middle of a work table. Both can be used to cut agates equally well using the same process, so use whichever one you have available. You can buy a diamond-tipped saw blade for either type of saw at a home improvement center, hardware store, or online."

Press the agate firmly against the tabletop of the power saw, then carefully slide it straight into the blade of the saw to start making the cut. If the agate is too small to leave at least 3 in (7.6 cm) of space between your fingertips and the saw blade, you can place the agate in a pair of locking pliers and hold the pliers to guide it while you make the cut. Never feed an agate into the saw blade at an angle or you might bend and break the blade. You can cut a whole agate in half by cutting straight through the middle or through the fattest part so the 2 halves have equally-sized faces.

Open up a table clamp just enough that you can fit the agate in it. Tighten the clamp\u2019s handle until the agate is held firmly in between the jaws of the clamp. Make sure the part of the agate that you want to cut is exposed when you clamp it. Wear a dust mask, protective eyewear, and work gloves. Put on safety glasses or goggles to protect your eyes from agate dust or flying chips. Cover your mouth and nose with a dust mask to avoid inhaling agate particles. Wear work gloves to protect your hands. Plug in and turn on the Dremel tool. Connect the Dremel rotary tool\u2019s power cord to a power outlet.
