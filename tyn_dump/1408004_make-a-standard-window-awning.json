Create a 2-dimensional square frame and attach an equally sized square frame to it so they share a middle spine. Make 2 identical 2-dimensional right triangle frames attached to the ends of your square frame. This makes a 3-dimensional right triangle frame. Attach a perpendicular board from the middle spine. This board will attach to the house for support. Affix metal elbow joints to each angle on the frame for sturdiness.
