        "Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lemon juice and salt for a natural option.",
        "If you would rather stay away from household chemical solutions for health or safety reasons, a lemon salt mixture will do the job.",
        "Scrub the mixture into the fabric on spots with mildew and mold and watch it dissolve.",
        "In this solution, citric acid from the lemon juice combines with salt to help break up the fungi, and the undissolved salt crystals act as an abrasive.",
        "Combine \u20444 cup (59 mL) of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.",
        "Scrubbing away mold and mildew with bleach will also sanitize the area and remove stains.",
        "While bleach alone can fade or discolor dark fabric, a mild bleach and water solution will most likely keep your colors safe.",
        "If you are concerned about discoloration, you can add less bleach to the water.",
        "Never use a bleach solution if you used ammonia on the cushions, as this will create poisonous chemicals that are harmful to your health.",
        "Use gloves if you use bleach to clean your cushions.",
        "Dab hydrogen peroxide on newly clean spots to remove any smell.",
        "Mold and mildew can leave behind smells on your cushions that can be hard to remove.",
        "A few drops of hydrogen peroxide on each spot will break up the smell and help your outdoor cushions smell fresh and clean again.",
        "Rinse the cushion with a hose and dry them.",
        "You\u2019ll need to rinse mildew and high-power stain removers off the pillows before using them again.",
        "The chemicals in cleaning products can be harmful to your skin, so rinsing off the cushions under a hose will keep you safe.",
        "Be sure to towel and air dry the cushions afterward.",
        "Protecting Your Outdoor Cushions Apply a coat of fabric sealer or protector.",
        "There are products available that will help waterproof or at least seal your cushions from water damage.",
        "Pick some up at a hardware or home and garden store, then spray it all over the cushion from around 3 feet (0.91 m) away.",
        "This will help keep mold, mildew, and stains off your cushions and provide protection from sun damage or fading, too.",
        "Bring your cushions in when it rains or snows.",
        "During rainy or cold seasons, keep your cushions indoors or in a secure outdoor container to keep them dry and safe from freezing temperatures.",
        "Even during a brief summer storm, it is a good idea to put outdoor cushions in a safe, dry place.",
        "Cushions under umbrellas are still vulnerable to rain.",
        "Bringing in the umbrella is a good idea, too, as it can also get rain damaged.",
        "Cover your cushions with a tarp.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to bring outdoor cushions in, or if it is a hassle to detach them from a piece of furniture, you can use a tarp to cover up the fabric during wet and cold seasons.",
        "Large and small plastic tarps can be purchased at most hardware stores.",
        "This won\u2019t keep them completely dry, and you risk a bit of mildew, but it is much better than leaving them exposed to the elements year-round"
