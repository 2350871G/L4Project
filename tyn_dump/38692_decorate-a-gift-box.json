This can help you come up with ideas for decorating materials. For example:\nIf the party has a nautical theme, you might want to use shells, ropes, and sand. If you want to go with a shabby-chic or vintage theme, you might want to use softer, faded colors (such as rose and ivory), velvet, and lace. Your designs might have lots of scrolls and roses in them."

Sometimes, knowing the season or holiday can help you decide on what colors to use. For example:\nIf this is for a Valentine's Day gift, consider using pinks, reds, and whites. If this is for a Halloween gift, consider using lots of black and orange. If you are giving the gift during the spring time, consider using lighter colors, such as: pink, yellow, light blue, light green, or light purple. White is also a great spring color. If you are giving the gift during fall, try to use earthy tones, such as: gold, orange, red, or brown."

For example:\nIf the gift is for a wedding, take the wedding colors into consideration. Try to use those colors when decorating your gift box. For example, if the colors are red and gold, you could paint the box red and stencil designs onto it using gold paint. If the gift is for a graduation party, you could use the school's colors in your gift box. You could also use common graduation party colors: black, silver/gold. If the gift is for a baby shower, consider using blue for a baby boy and pink for a baby girl. If you know the theme of the baby shower, try to use that in your design. Also you can use normal wrapping paper for decorating a normal box."

Here are some ideas:\nIf the gift box is for a birthday present, use bright colors (or the receiver's favorite colors). Write \"Happy Birthday\" all over the box. Consider drawing some balloons, tiny stars or confetti, and spirals. If the box is for a holiday, use colors and symbols that match the holiday.

If you want to mimic the look of gift wrap, however, arrange your stickers in a grid or checkered pattern (as opposed to randomly). Also, try to use only one or two shapes; this will make your gift box look interesting, but also refined. For example:\nFor a winter themed gift box, you can alternate large blue snowflakes with small silver snowflakes. For a fall themed gift box, you could alternate red or gold leaves with orange pumpkins. For a summer or spring themed gift box, you could alternate butterflies and flowers."

Here are some ideas:\nFor a winter themed box, paint the box a light blue first. Then, paint delicate snowflakes and snow swirls using white and silver paint. For a birthday themed box, choose a cheerful color, such as yellow, for the base. Then, paint some birthday-related symbols, such as confetti, balloons, and cakes.

Let the glue dry before doing anything else, such as placing a gift inside the box or tying a ribbon around the box. If you want a layered look, glue a thinner ribbon right over the wider one. Just make sure that the thinner ribbon is centered over the wider ribbon. Washi tape, scrapbook tape, or any other colored/patterned tape will work as well.

For example, if the box is for a Christmas gift, you could do any of the following:\nIf the box has a blue or winter theme, loop a silver or white glittery snowflake around the ribbon. If the box has a more rustic feel to it, snip a small branch off of your Christmas tree and tuck it behind the bow. You can also use a cinnamon stick instead. If the box has a more traditional feel to it, you could tuck a small pine branch behind the bow, and add a tiny glass ornament; the ornament shouldn't be larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) or so in diameter. For a sweet tooth, you might want to stick a candy cane behind the bow. If you want to add a more festive touch, look a jingle bell ornament over the top of the candy cane."

Keep stacking pieces until you get the look you want. Try not to use too many, however. Three or four should be plenty. You can complete the look by outlining the shapes with some glitter glue, and stamping pretty designs into the corner of the box. Try to use ornate paper cutouts with scalloped edges."

You don't need a lot of shapes to make this look beautiful, but you might want to use fewer large shapes and more of the smaller ones. Consider working in odd numbers, instead of even.

Try to center the narrow ribbon as much as possible. You can tie the two together into a bow at the top of the box, or you can add a third, really narrow piece of ribbon. If the ribbons slip around too much, secure them with short pieces of clear, double-sided tape. Do not use the thick, white, foam mounting tape you'd put on your wall. That is too thick and will create lumps in your ribbon. Consider using contrasting colors for your ribbons that match your box. For example, if your box is white, you can use teal for the wide ribbon, and white for the narrower ribbon. Consider mixing and matching patterns. You can use solid-colored ribbons, or you can use patterned ones. You can also use a solid-colored ribbon and a patterned one on top of it. Consider mixing and matching textures. If you want a more vintage or shabby-chic look, consider using burlap for the bottom ribbon, and flat (non-ruffled) lace for the narrower ribbon. You can finish the layering off with a piece of twine or hemp cord."

    "text": " Steps Have a theme in mind. Most parties and events will have a certain theme to them. If the party does not have a theme, you might want to come up with a theme for your gift. This can help you come up with ideas for decorating materials. For example:\nIf the party has a nautical theme, you might want to use shells, ropes, and sand. If you want to go with a shabby-chic or vintage theme, you might want to use softer, faded colors (such as rose and ivory), velvet, and lace. Your designs might have lots of scrolls and roses in them. Keep the person who is receiving the gift in mind. Is it a child? An adult? What are his or her interests? If the gift is for a young child, you might want to use lots of bright colors to appeal to his or her senses. If the gift is for a cat lover, you could always make the gift box cat themed. Keep the season and/or holiday in mind. Is the gift for Valentines Day? Halloween? Is the occasion taking place during spring or fall? Sometimes, knowing the season or holiday can help you decide on what colors to use. For example:\nIf this is for a Valentine's Day gift, consider using pinks, reds, and whites. If this is for a Halloween gift, consider using lots of black and orange. If you are giving the gift during the spring time, consider using lighter colors, such as: pink, yellow, light blue, light green, or light purple. White is also a great spring color. If you are giving the gift during fall, try to use earthy tones, such as: gold, orange, red, or brown. Keep the occasion in mind. Is the gift for a wedding, baby shower, or graduation party? The event itself may help you decide how to decorate the box. For example:\nIf the gift is for a wedding, take the wedding colors into consideration. Try to use those colors when decorating your gift box. For example, if the colors are red and gold, you could paint the box red and stencil designs onto it using gold paint. If the gift is for a graduation party, you could use the school's colors in your gift box. You could also use common graduation party colors: black, silver/gold. If the gift is for a baby shower, consider using blue for a baby boy and pink for a baby girl. If you know the theme of the baby shower, try to use that in your design. Also you can use normal wrapping paper for decorating a normal box. Adding Simple Designs and Color to the Box Add some simple designs onto the box using stamps, markers, or wrapping paper. This section will give you a few, simple ideas on how to decorate your box. You don't have to use all of them. You can choose one or two that appeal to you the most or none at all. Use a permanent marker or a paint pen to add writing or designs onto your box. Permanent markers are cheaper and easier to use, but paint pens are more opaque and will show up against patterns and dark colors. You can write simple messages, such as \"Happy Birthday\" or \"Love.\" You can also draw random designs, such as hearts, spirals, and swirls. Here are some ideas:\nIf the gift box is for a birthday present, use bright colors (or the receiver's favorite colors). Write \"Happy Birthday\" all over the box. Consider drawing some balloons, tiny stars or confetti, and spirals. If the box is for a holiday, use colors and symbols that match the holiday. For example, if the gift box is for Halloween, use orange and black for the colors. Draw some pumpkins, black cats, or bats. Stamp designs onto the box using rubber stamps and an ink pad. You can use regular rubber stamps and an ink pad. You can also cut your own stamps out of thin sponges and use tempera paint for the ink. Try using different sized stamps. For example, use the larger stamps (such as trees) towards the bottom, and smaller stamps (such as stars) towards the top. Consider using different colors of ink or paint. Decorate the box with some stickers to mimic gift wrap. Most gift wrap has a set, repeating pattern. Your gift box doesn't have to have that; the stickers can be all random. If you want to mimic the look of gift wrap, however, arrange your stickers in a grid or checkered pattern (as opposed to randomly). Also, try to use only one or two shapes; this will make your gift box look interesting, but also refined. For example:\nFor a winter themed gift box, you can alternate large blue snowflakes with small silver snowflakes. For a fall themed gift box, you could alternate red or gold leaves with orange pumpkins. For a summer or spring themed gift box, you could alternate butterflies and flowers. Consider painting your gift box. Take the lid off first, and then paint each piece separately. You can use acrylic paint and apply it with a foam brush or a paint brush. You can also use spray paint. If you want to add more designs, wait for the paint to dry first, then paint on smaller designs using a thin paint brush. Here are some ideas:\nFor a winter themed box, paint the box a light blue first. Then, paint delicate snowflakes and snow swirls using white and silver paint. For a birthday themed box, choose a cheerful color, such as yellow, for the base. Then, paint some birthday-related symbols, such as confetti, balloons, and cakes. Try to use bold colors, such as blue, red, and green. Apply some glitter or confetti to give your box a blast of glitter. Spread a thin layer of Mod Podge over the side you want glittered. Then, sprinkle some glitter or sparkly confetti onto the box. You can use as much or as little as you want. If you want the entire box to be glittered, let the side you are working on first dry completely before moving onto the next. To seal your work and make it last longer, wait for the glue to dry, then spray the entire box with a clear, glossy, acrylic spray. The spray must be glossy or your glitter will lose its sparkle. You can also use spray adhesive instead of Mod Podge. Add a stripe of color with wrapping paper. Place your gift inside the box, and put the lid on. Cut a long strip of wrapping paper that is one third the width of your box; it needs to be long enough to wrap around your box. Place the strip on top of your box, and wrap it over the sides. Secure the ends of the wrapping paper strip to the bottom of the box with a piece of clear tape. Consider wrapping a piece of thin ribbon or twine around the box, and tying it in a bow on top. Make sure that the ribbon or twine is centered over the paper strip. For a layered look, repeat the process, but with a slightly narrower piece of wrapping paper. Try to use a contrasting color or pattern for a striking look. Adding Design and Color to the Lid Consider decorating the lid. This section will give you a few ideas on how to decorate the lid of your box. You don't have to use all of these ideas. Instead, choose one or two that you like the best. Keep the occasion in mind. Even if the rest of the box is plain, you can easily make it suitable for any occasion depending on what you put on top of it. Glue colored ribbon around the sides of the lid. Choose a ribbon that matches the height of your lid. Most listed will be about an inch (2.54 centimeters) tall. You can also use rickrack or flat (non-ruffled) lace. Place some fabric glue around all four sides of the lid. Do not put any glue on top of the lid. Then, press the ribbon down onto the glue. Let the glue dry before doing anything else, such as placing a gift inside the box or tying a ribbon around the box. If you want a layered look, glue a thinner ribbon right over the wider one. Just make sure that the thinner ribbon is centered over the wider ribbon. Washi tape, scrapbook tape, or any other colored/patterned tape will work as well. Skip the glue, and just run the tape around all four sides of the lid. This will also work great on round or hexagonal lids as well. Add some embellishments to the ribbon. After you have placed the gift inside the box and tied a ribbon, tuck some embellishments just behind the ribbon. Try to match the embellishments to the theme of the event. If necessary, secure the embellishment with hot glue or clear tape. For example, if the box is for a Christmas gift, you could do any of the following:\nIf the box has a blue or winter theme, loop a silver or white glittery snowflake around the ribbon. If the box has a more rustic feel to it, snip a small branch off of your Christmas tree and tuck it behind the bow. You can also use a cinnamon stick instead. If the box has a more traditional feel to it, you could tuck a small pine branch behind the bow, and add a tiny glass ornament; the ornament shouldn't be larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) or so in diameter. For a sweet tooth, you might want to stick a candy cane behind the bow. If you want to add a more festive touch, look a jingle bell ornament over the top of the candy cane. Consider layering paper cutouts if you are into scrapbooking. You will need several pieces of patterned and plain cardstock. They should be of a similar shape, but in different sizes. Use small, double-sided foam tape to attach the largest piece to the center of the lid. Then, use the tape to attach a slightly smaller piece on top of the large one. Keep stacking pieces until you get the look you want. Try not to use too many, however. Three or four should be plenty. You can complete the look by outlining the shapes with some glitter glue, and stamping pretty designs into the corner of the box. Try to use ornate paper cutouts with scalloped edges. Glue down some scrapbooking embellishments onto the lid. You can find them in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Find some colorful paper flowers, butterflies, and leaves in different sizes and glue them down in a small patch on the lid. Try to the largest shapes in the center of the patch, and the smaller designs on the sides. Give the patch an asymmetric shape to make it more interesting. You don't need a lot of shapes to make this look beautiful, but you might want to use fewer large shapes and more of the smaller ones. Consider working in odd numbers, instead of even. For example, you could have three large shapes, and five to seven smaller ones. Paint the lid with chalkboard paint, and write the person's name on the lid in chalk. This way, you won't have to mess around with labels. You can apply the paint on using a foam brush, or you can use chalkboard spray paint. Apply two to three coats, allowing each coat to dry before applying the next one. Let the paint to dry and cure according to the instructions on the can, then prime the chalkboard. You can do this by covering it allover with chalk, then wiping the chalk off. Give the lid some texture. Find a large, paper doily that is the same width as your box lid. Glue the doily down onto the lid using some spray adhesive or Mod Podge. Let the glue dry, then wrap a pretty ribbon around your box. Keep kids and doodlers happy by taping some crayons to the lid of a blank box. A blank box may be someone else's canvas. Take five or six crayons in basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple), and tape them side by side in a neat row in the corner of the lid. Write the words \"Color Me\" next to the crayons. You can also cut down some coloring book pages so that the fit each side of the box, and glue them to the box. Tape the crayons to the top corner of the box. This will give your little artist something to color once the event is over. Playing with Ribbon Use ribbons to your advantage. This section will give you a few ideas on how to use ribbons to decorate your box. You don't have to use all of these ideas. Choose one or two that you like the best. Layer the ribbons. Wrap a wide, ribbon around the gift box first, from bottom to top. Next, wrap a narrower ribbon around the wider one. Try to center the narrow ribbon as much as possible. You can tie the two together into a bow at the top of the box, or you can add a third, really narrow piece of ribbon. If the ribbons slip around too much, secure them with short pieces of clear, double-sided tape. Do not use the thick, white, foam mounting tape you'd put on your wall. That is too thick and will create lumps in your ribbon. Consider using contrasting colors for your ribbons that match your box. For example, if your box is white, you can use teal for the wide ribbon, and white for the narrower ribbon. Consider mixing and matching patterns. You can use solid-colored ribbons, or you can use patterned ones. You can also use a solid-colored ribbon and a patterned one on top of it. Consider mixing and matching textures. If you want a more vintage or shabby-chic look, consider using burlap for the bottom ribbon, and flat (non-ruffled) lace for the narrower ribbon. You can finish the layering off with a piece of twine or hemp cord. Make a garland out of paper and string, and use that instead of ribbon. Get out a piece of yarn or cotton string that is long enough to wrap around your gift box a few times. Use a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) or larger shaped hole punch (such as a heart of star) to punch shapes out of colorful paper. Super glue the shapes down onto the string. They can be as close together or as far apart as you want. Wait for the glue to dry, then wrap it around your gift box. You can buy large hole punches in interesting shapes (such as snowflakes, hearts, stars, and flowers) from arts and crafts shops. Look in the scrapbook supply section. Make a garland out of twine and colorful buttons. Find some buttons that have two or four holes in them; the cheap, craft buttons that come in a bucket at great for this. Then, cut a piece of twine long enough to wrap around your box a few times. Weave the twine through the holes in the buttons until you have as many buttons as you want on your twine. Tie a knot at each of the twine, then tie the twine around your box like you would with a ribbon. This is great for a rustic gift of a baby shower. Here are some color ideas:\nFor a rustic gift, choose a brown piece of twine. Use buttons in random colors and sizes. For a gift for a baby girl, use a pink piece of twine. You can use all pink buttons, or alternate pink and white buttons. For a baby boy, use a light blue piece of twine. You can use all light blue buttons, or alternate them with white buttons. Wrap a ribbon around the box and lid separately. This will allow the receiver to pull the lid off without untying and ruining a beautifully-crafted bow. Create a cross shape with two pieces of ribbon, and set your box down onto the middle of it. Wrap each side of ribbon up over each side of the box, and tuck the excess ribbon inside the box. Secure the ribbon with a drop of glue. Repeat the process for the lid. Make the bow separately, and glue it on top of the box lid. Hot glue or fabric glue will be the best for this. They dry the fastest. Consider using other things instead of ribbon. You can use twine, raffia, lace ribbon, or colorful yarn. You can even use 1 to 2 inch wide (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) pieces of calico fabric or fabric. Each will give your box a different unique look. You don't always have to tie a box up with ribbon. Consider skipping the bow, and using something else instead. Wrap some ribbon or twine around your gift, but instead of tying it into a bow, tie it into a tight knot and snip the ends off. Glue a flat ornament, such as a snowflake, a large paper flower, a large sea shell, or even a giant pompom over the knot. Covering a Plain Gift Box with Paper Gather your supplies. If you have a plain cardboard box with a lid, you can cover each piece with colorful paper. This way, the person just has to untie the ribbon and open the gift. Here's a list of what you'll need:\nGift box with a lid\nWrapping paper\nPencil and ruler\nScissors\nClear, double-sided tape\nClear, regular tape Take the lid off your box. You can wrap both the lid and the box separately. You can also wrap just the lid or just the box. This will create an interesting contrast. These instructions will work for both the lid and the box. Place a large piece of wrapping paper down in front of you. You need enough wrapping paper to wrap over the box. Make sure that the blank side of the wrapping paper is facing you. Stick the box down onto the wrapping paper with double-sided tape. You can make a large X-shape going from corner to corner. You can also place a piece of tape along each, bottom edge of the box. Now the box won't slip while you are wrapping it. The tape must be thin and clear. Do not use the thick mounting tape you'd put on your wall. That is too thick and will create bumps. Trim the wrapping paper down. The wrapping paper should be wide enough so that you can fold each side up over the sides of the box, plus an additional inch or two. You will need that extra paper to tuck inside the box. Draw a line going from each corner of the paper to each corner of the box. Use a ruler to help you make the lines straight. These will be your cutting guidelines. Cut along each line. Start at the corner of the paper and stop when you get to a box corner. Fold the top and bottom halves of the paper over the top and bottom sides of the box. There should be about an inch or two of wrapping paper inside the box on each side. These are your hems. Secure these hems with some regular, clear tape. The cut/angled sides of the wrapping paper will be touching the left and right sides of your box. This is fine. Consider gluing the paper to the sides of the box with a glue stick. This will make it last even longer. Fold the left and right halves of the paper over the left and right sides of the box. Secure the hems with more clear tape as before. The cut/angled sides of the paper will be touching the top and bottom sides of your box. This is fine too; it will give the box a \"wrapped\" look. Repeat the wrapping process with the lid, if you want to cover the lid too. You can use the same color and pattern of wrapping paper, or a completely different one. Place the gift inside the box, and cover it with the lid. If you want, you can tuck some matching tissue paper inside the box. This will help keep the gift inside safe. It may also make the box more fun to unwrap. Wrap some ribbon around the box and tie it in a bow on top.  Stenciling a Gift Box Gather your supplies. Stenciling a gift box is a great way to add your personal, unique touch. Here's a list of what you will need:\nPlain gift box\nStencils\nPainter's tape or masking tape (optional)\nAcrylic or tempera paint\nFoam brush or stencil brush\nPaint palette or paper plate\nPaper weights, cups, stones, etc Place the stencil down onto the side of box. You will be stenciling one side of the box at a time. Some stencils are sticky on the back and will stick to the box on their own. If your stencil does not have a sticky back, you will need to put a piece of painter's tape or masking tape along each edge to hold it down. If your box has a lid, then take the lid off, and stencil it separately. Pour the paint out onto a paint palette or a paper plate. You can use acrylic paint or tempera paint. Acrylic paint will give you a nice, glossy finish. Tempera paint will give you a somewhat chalky or dusty finish, which can also be very nice. You can also use glitter and glue instead if you want your design to be super glittery. If you want your design to be only somewhat glittery, glitter paint instead of regular paint. Dip your brush into the paint and tap off the excess paint. This will keep you from picking up too much paint. If you apply too much paint at once, the paint may slip under the stencil and cause smears and drips. Tap the brush onto the stencil. Keep taping until the entire area is covered with paint. If the paint is too thin, apply a second, thin coat. It is better to layer many thin coats than slap on one thick coat. Let the paint dry before you remove the stencil and work on another side of the box. At this point, you can flip or rotate the box to make it easier to paint. Most paints should be dry to the touch within 5 to 20 minutes. Let the paint dry completely before you put anything into the box. Just because something looks dry does not mean that it is dry underneath. If you move your box too soon, you may risk smearing the paint. Most paints will be completely dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours, but you might want to check the label on the paint bottle just in case. If you added glitter to your design, you might want to spray the box with a clear, acrylic sealer. Make sure that the spray is glossy, or your glitter will lose its sparkle. Decoupaging a Gift Box Gather your supplies. Decoupage is a great way to create a unique, layered look. It is ideal for those who want a vintage or shabby-chic look to their box. Here's what you'll need:\nPlain gift box\nSolid colored or patterned paper\nScissors\nMod Podge or decoupage glue\nFoam brush Cut your paper into shapes. If your paper has designs on it, such as butterflies, flowers, or birds, then cut around the designs. If your paper is solid colored, you can cut your own shapes, such as hearts and stars. Consider arranging your design on the table in front of you before you glue it down onto the box. This will allow you to fix any mistakes. It will also allow you to experiment with different shapes and layering until you get the look you want. Once you put the paper down onto the Mod Podge, it will be difficult to move it without ruining it. Set the box down on its side in front of you. You will be working on one side of the box at a time so that your work surface does not get all sticky. If your box comes with a lid, take the lid off and work on it separately. Use a foam brush to apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to a small patch on the box. You will be working in small areas at a time so that the Mod Podge does not dry out before you get to it. If you can't find any Mod Podge or decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing one part white school glue with one part water. Press the paper down onto the glue. You can place the shapes down individually, or overlap them to create new designs. For example, you can paste a flower shape down onto some leaf shapes. If you are overlapping shapes, be sure to coat the bottom shape with Mod Podge so that the top shape will stick. Let the glue dry before working on another side of the box. Once the glue dries, flip or rotate the box and continue decoupaging pieces of paper onto it. Cover the entire box with another thin layer of Mod Podge. This will help seal in your work. You can use the same finish that you were using before (such as gloss, matte, or satin). You can also try using a glittery one for some extra sparkle. Allow the box to dry completely before putting anything inside it. If you put the lid on too soon, it will get stuck to the box, and the receiver will have a hard time opening it.",

        "For example:\nIf the party has a nautical theme, you might want to use shells, ropes, and sand.",
        "If you want to go with a shabby-chic or vintage theme, you might want to use softer, faded colors (such as rose and ivory), velvet, and lace.",

        "If this is for a Halloween gift, consider using lots of black and orange.",
        "If you are giving the gift during the spring time, consider using lighter colors, such as: pink, yellow, light blue, light green, or light purple.",
        "White is also a great spring color.",
        "If you are giving the gift during fall, try to use earthy tones, such as: gold, orange, red, or brown.",
        "Keep the occasion in mind.",
        "Is the gift for a wedding, baby shower, or graduation party?",
        "The event itself may help you decide how to decorate the box.",
        "For example:\nIf the gift is for a wedding, take the wedding colors into consideration.",
        "Try to use those colors when decorating your gift box.",
        "For example, if the colors are red and gold, you could paint the box red and stencil designs onto it using gold paint.",

        "Adding Simple Designs and Color to the Box Add some simple designs onto the box using stamps, markers, or wrapping paper.",
        "This section will give you a few, simple ideas on how to decorate your box.",
        "You don't have to use all of them.",
        "You can choose one or two that appeal to you the most or none at all.",
        "Use a permanent marker or a paint pen to add writing or designs onto your box.",
        "Permanent markers are cheaper and easier to use, but paint pens are more opaque and will show up against patterns and dark colors.",
        "You can write simple messages, such as \"Happy Birthday\" or \"Love.\"",
        "You can also draw random designs, such as hearts, spirals, and swirls.",
        "Here are some ideas:\nIf the gift box is for a birthday present, use bright colors (or the receiver's favorite colors).",
        "Write \"Happy Birthday\" all over the box.",

        "Draw some pumpkins, black cats, or bats.",
        "Stamp designs onto the box using rubber stamps and an ink pad.",
        "You can use regular rubber stamps and an ink pad.",
        "You can also cut your own stamps out of thin sponges and use tempera paint for the ink.",
        "Try using different sized stamps.",
        "For example, use the larger stamps (such as trees) towards the bottom, and smaller stamps (such as stars) towards the top.",
        "Consider using different colors of ink or paint.",
        "Decorate the box with some stickers to mimic gift wrap.",
        "Most gift wrap has a set, repeating pattern.",
        "Your gift box doesn't have to have that; the stickers can be all random.",
        "If you want to mimic the look of gift wrap, however, arrange your stickers in a grid or checkered pattern (as opposed to randomly).",
        "Also, try to use only one or two shapes; this will make your gift box look interesting, but also refined.",
        "For example:\nFor a winter themed gift box, you can alternate large blue snowflakes with small silver snowflakes.",
        "For a fall themed gift box, you could alternate red or gold leaves with orange pumpkins.",
        "For a summer or spring themed gift box, you could alternate butterflies and flowers.",
        "Consider painting your gift box.",
        "Take the lid off first, and then paint each piece separately.",
        "You can use acrylic paint and apply it with a foam brush or a paint brush.",
        "You can also use spray paint.",
        "If you want to add more designs, wait for the paint to dry first, then paint on smaller designs using a thin paint brush.",
        "Here are some ideas:\nFor a winter themed box, paint the box a light blue first.",
        "Then, paint delicate snowflakes and snow swirls using white and silver paint.",

        "Try to use bold colors, such as blue, red, and green.",
        "Apply some glitter or confetti to give your box a blast of glitter.",
        "Spread a thin layer of Mod Podge over the side you want glittered.",
        "Then, sprinkle some glitter or sparkly confetti onto the box.",
        "You can use as much or as little as you want.",
        "If you want the entire box to be glittered, let the side you are working on first dry completely before moving onto the next.",
        "To seal your work and make it last longer, wait for the glue to dry, then spray the entire box with a clear, glossy, acrylic spray.",
        "The spray must be glossy or your glitter will lose its sparkle.",
        "You can also use spray adhesive instead of Mod Podge.",
        "Add a stripe of color with wrapping paper.",
        "Place your gift inside the box, and put the lid on.",
        "Cut a long strip of wrapping paper that is one third the width of your box; it needs to be long enough to wrap around your box.",
        "Place the strip on top of your box, and wrap it over the sides.",
        "Secure the ends of the wrapping paper strip to the bottom of the box with a piece of clear tape.",
        "Consider wrapping a piece of thin ribbon or twine around the box, and tying it in a bow on top.",
        "Make sure that the ribbon or twine is centered over the paper strip.",
        "For a layered look, repeat the process, but with a slightly narrower piece of wrapping paper.",
        "Try to use a contrasting color or pattern for a striking look.",
        "Adding Design and Color to the Lid Consider decorating the lid.",
        "This section will give you a few ideas on how to decorate the lid of your box.",
        "You don't have to use all of these ideas.",
        "Instead, choose one or two that you like the best.",
        "Keep the occasion in mind.",
        "Even if the rest of the box is plain, you can easily make it suitable for any occasion depending on what you put on top of it.",
        "Glue colored ribbon around the sides of the lid.",
        "Choose a ribbon that matches the height of your lid.",
        "Most listed will be about an inch (2.54 centimeters) tall.",

        "Place some fabric glue around all four sides of the lid.",
        "Do not put any glue on top of the lid.",
        "Then, press the ribbon down onto the glue.",
        "Let the glue dry before doing anything else, such as placing a gift inside the box or tying a ribbon around the box.",
        "If you want a layered look, glue a thinner ribbon right over the wider one.",
        "Just make sure that the thinner ribbon is centered over the wider ribbon.",
        "Washi tape, scrapbook tape, or any other colored/patterned tape will work as well.",
        "Skip the glue, and just run the tape around all four sides of the lid.",
        "This will also work great on round or hexagonal lids as well.",
        "Add some embellishments to the ribbon.",
        "After you have placed the gift inside the box and tied a ribbon, tuck some embellishments just behind the ribbon.",
        "Try to match the embellishments to the theme of the event.",
        "If necessary, secure the embellishment with hot glue or clear tape.",
        "For example, if the box is for a Christmas gift, you could do any of the following:\nIf the box has a blue or winter theme, loop a silver or white glittery snowflake around the ribbon.",
        "If the box has a more rustic feel to it, snip a small branch off of your Christmas tree and tuck it behind the bow.",
        "You can also use a cinnamon stick instead.",
        "If the box has a more traditional feel to it, you could tuck a small pine branch behind the bow, and add a tiny glass ornament; the ornament shouldn't be larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) or so in diameter.",
        "For a sweet tooth, you might want to stick a candy cane behind the bow.",
        "If you want to add a more festive touch, look a jingle bell ornament over the top of the candy cane.",
        "Consider layering paper cutouts if you are into scrapbooking.",
        "You will need several pieces of patterned and plain cardstock.",
        "They should be of a similar shape, but in different sizes.",
        "Use small, double-sided foam tape to attach the largest piece to the center of the lid.",
        "Then, use the tape to attach a slightly smaller piece on top of the large one.",
        "Keep stacking pieces until you get the look you want.",
        "Try not to use too many, however.",
        "Three or four should be plenty.",
        "You can complete the look by outlining the shapes with some glitter glue, and stamping pretty designs into the corner of the box.",
        "Try to use ornate paper cutouts with scalloped edges.",
        "Glue down some scrapbooking embellishments onto the lid.",
        "You can find them in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.",
        "Find some colorful paper flowers, butterflies, and leaves in different sizes and glue them down in a small patch on the lid.",
        "Try to the largest shapes in the center of the patch, and the smaller designs on the sides.",
        "Give the patch an asymmetric shape to make it more interesting.",
        "You don't need a lot of shapes to make this look beautiful, but you might want to use fewer large shapes and more of the smaller ones.",
        "Consider working in odd numbers, instead of even.",
        "For example, you could have three large shapes, and five to seven smaller ones.",
        "Paint the lid with chalkboard paint, and write the person's name on the lid in chalk.",
        "This way, you won't have to mess around with labels.",
        "You can apply the paint on using a foam brush, or you can use chalkboard spray paint.",
        "Apply two to three coats, allowing each coat to dry before applying the next one.",
        "Let the paint to dry and cure according to the instructions on the can, then prime the chalkboard.",
        "You can do this by covering it allover with chalk, then wiping the chalk off.",

        "Write the words \"Color Me\" next to the crayons.",
        "You can also cut down some coloring book pages so that the fit each side of the box, and glue them to the box.",

        "This section will give you a few ideas on how to use ribbons to decorate your box.",
        "You don't have to use all of these ideas.",
        "Choose one or two that you like the best.",
        "Layer the ribbons.",
        "Wrap a wide, ribbon around the gift box first, from bottom to top.",
        "Next, wrap a narrower ribbon around the wider one.",
        "Try to center the narrow ribbon as much as possible.",
        "You can tie the two together into a bow at the top of the box, or you can add a third, really narrow piece of ribbon.",
        "If the ribbons slip around too much, secure them with short pieces of clear, double-sided tape.",
        "Do not use the thick, white, foam mounting tape you'd put on your wall.",
        "That is too thick and will create lumps in your ribbon.",
        "Consider using contrasting colors for your ribbons that match your box.",
        "For example, if your box is white, you can use teal for the wide ribbon, and white for the narrower ribbon.",
        "Consider mixing and matching patterns.",
        "You can use solid-colored ribbons, or you can use patterned ones.",
        "You can also use a solid-colored ribbon and a patterned one on top of it.",
        "Consider mixing and matching textures.",
        "If you want a more vintage or shabby-chic look, consider using burlap for the bottom ribbon, and flat (non-ruffled) lace for the narrower ribbon.",
        "You can finish the layering off with a piece of twine or hemp cord.",
        "Make a garland out of paper and string, and use that instead of ribbon.",
        "Get out a piece of yarn or cotton string that is long enough to wrap around your gift box a few times.",
        "Use a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) or larger shaped hole punch (such as a heart of star) to punch shapes out of colorful paper.",
        "Super glue the shapes down onto the string.",
        "They can be as close together or as far apart as you want.",
        "Wait for the glue to dry, then wrap it around your gift box.",
        "You can buy large hole punches in interesting shapes (such as snowflakes, hearts, stars, and flowers) from arts and crafts shops.",
        "Look in the scrapbook supply section.",
        "Make a garland out of twine and colorful buttons.",
        "Find some buttons that have two or four holes in them; the cheap, craft buttons that come in a bucket at great for this.",
        "Then, cut a piece of twine long enough to wrap around your box a few times.",
        "Weave the twine through the holes in the buttons until you have as many buttons as you want on your twine.",
        "Tie a knot at each of the twine, then tie the twine around your box like you would with a ribbon.",
        "This is great for a rustic gift of a baby shower.",
        "Here are some color ideas:\nFor a rustic gift, choose a brown piece of twine.",
        "Use buttons in random colors and sizes.",
        "For a gift for a baby girl, use a pink piece of twine.",
        "You can use all pink buttons, or alternate pink and white buttons.",
        "For a baby boy, use a light blue piece of twine.",
        "You can use all light blue buttons, or alternate them with white buttons.",
        "Wrap a ribbon around the box and lid separately.",
        "This will allow the receiver to pull the lid off without untying and ruining a beautifully-crafted bow.",
        "Create a cross shape with two pieces of ribbon, and set your box down onto the middle of it.",
        "Wrap each side of ribbon up over each side of the box, and tuck the excess ribbon inside the box.",
        "Secure the ribbon with a drop of glue.",
        "Repeat the process for the lid.",
        "Make the bow separately, and glue it on top of the box lid.",
        "Hot glue or fabric glue will be the best for this.",
        "They dry the fastest.",
        "Consider using other things instead of ribbon.",
        "You can use twine, raffia, lace ribbon, or colorful yarn.",
        "You can even use 1 to 2 inch wide (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) pieces of calico fabric or fabric.",
        "Each will give your box a different unique look.",
        "You don't always have to tie a box up with ribbon.",
        "Consider skipping the bow, and using something else instead.",
        "Wrap some ribbon or twine around your gift, but instead of tying it into a bow, tie it into a tight knot and snip the ends off.",
        "Glue a flat ornament, such as a snowflake, a large paper flower, a large sea shell, or even a giant pompom over the knot.",
        "Covering a Plain Gift Box with Paper Gather your supplies.",
        "If you have a plain cardboard box with a lid, you can cover each piece with colorful paper.",
        "This way, the person just has to untie the ribbon and open the gift.",
        "Here's a list of what you'll need:\nGift box with a lid\nWrapping paper\nPencil and ruler\nScissors\nClear, double-sided tape\nClear, regular tape Take the lid off your box.",
        "You can wrap both the lid and the box separately.",
        "You can also wrap just the lid or just the box.",
        "This will create an interesting contrast.",
        "These instructions will work for both the lid and the box.",
        "Place a large piece of wrapping paper down in front of you.",
        "You need enough wrapping paper to wrap over the box.",
        "Make sure that the blank side of the wrapping paper is facing you.",
        "Stick the box down onto the wrapping paper with double-sided tape.",
        "You can make a large X-shape going from corner to corner.",
        "You can also place a piece of tape along each, bottom edge of the box.",
        "Now the box won't slip while you are wrapping it.",
        "The tape must be thin and clear.",
        "Do not use the thick mounting tape you'd put on your wall.",
        "That is too thick and will create bumps.",
        "Trim the wrapping paper down.",
        "The wrapping paper should be wide enough so that you can fold each side up over the sides of the box, plus an additional inch or two.",
        "You will need that extra paper to tuck inside the box.",
        "Draw a line going from each corner of the paper to each corner of the box.",
        "Use a ruler to help you make the lines straight.",
        "These will be your cutting guidelines.",
        "Cut along each line.",
        "Start at the corner of the paper and stop when you get to a box corner.",
        "Fold the top and bottom halves of the paper over the top and bottom sides of the box.",
        "There should be about an inch or two of wrapping paper inside the box on each side.",
        "These are your hems.",
        "Secure these hems with some regular, clear tape.",
        "The cut/angled sides of the wrapping paper will be touching the left and right sides of your box.",
        "This is fine.",
        "Consider gluing the paper to the sides of the box with a glue stick.",
        "This will make it last even longer.",
        "Fold the left and right halves of the paper over the left and right sides of the box.",
        "Secure the hems with more clear tape as before.",
        "The cut/angled sides of the paper will be touching the top and bottom sides of your box.",
        "This is fine too; it will give the box a \"wrapped\" look.",
        "Repeat the wrapping process with the lid, if you want to cover the lid too.",
        "You can use the same color and pattern of wrapping paper, or a completely different one.",
        "Place the gift inside the box, and cover it with the lid.",
        "If you want, you can tuck some matching tissue paper inside the box.",
        "This will help keep the gift inside safe.",
        "It may also make the box more fun to unwrap.",
        "Wrap some ribbon around the box and tie it in a bow on top.",
        "Stenciling a Gift Box Gather your supplies.",
        "Stenciling a gift box is a great way to add your personal, unique touch.",
        "Here's a list of what you will need:\nPlain gift box\nStencils\nPainter's tape or masking tape (optional)\nAcrylic or tempera paint\nFoam brush or stencil brush\nPaint palette or paper plate\nPaper weights, cups, stones, etc Place the stencil down onto the side of box.",
        "You will be stenciling one side of the box at a time.",
        "Some stencils are sticky on the back and will stick to the box on their own.",
        "If your stencil does not have a sticky back, you will need to put a piece of painter's tape or masking tape along each edge to hold it down.",
        "If your box has a lid, then take the lid off, and stencil it separately.",
        "Pour the paint out onto a paint palette or a paper plate.",
        "You can use acrylic paint or tempera paint.",
        "Acrylic paint will give you a nice, glossy finish.",
        "Tempera paint will give you a somewhat chalky or dusty finish, which can also be very nice.",
        "You can also use glitter and glue instead if you want your design to be super glittery.",
        "If you want your design to be only somewhat glittery, glitter paint instead of regular paint.",
        "Dip your brush into the paint and tap off the excess paint.",
        "This will keep you from picking up too much paint.",
        "If you apply too much paint at once, the paint may slip under the stencil and cause smears and drips.",
        "Tap the brush onto the stencil.",
        "Keep taping until the entire area is covered with paint.",
        "If the paint is too thin, apply a second, thin coat.",
        "It is better to layer many thin coats than slap on one thick coat.",
        "Let the paint dry before you remove the stencil and work on another side of the box.",
        "At this point, you can flip or rotate the box to make it easier to paint.",
        "Most paints should be dry to the touch within 5 to 20 minutes.",
        "Let the paint dry completely before you put anything into the box.",
        "Just because something looks dry does not mean that it is dry underneath.",
        "If you move your box too soon, you may risk smearing the paint.",
        "Most paints will be completely dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours, but you might want to check the label on the paint bottle just in case.",
        "If you added glitter to your design, you might want to spray the box with a clear, acrylic sealer.",
        "Make sure that the spray is glossy, or your glitter will lose its sparkle.",
        "Decoupaging a Gift Box Gather your supplies.",
        "Decoupage is a great way to create a unique, layered look.",
        "It is ideal for those who want a vintage or shabby-chic look to their box.",
        "Here's what you'll need:\nPlain gift box\nSolid colored or patterned paper\nScissors\nMod Podge or decoupage glue\nFoam brush Cut your paper into shapes.",
        "If your paper has designs on it, such as butterflies, flowers, or birds, then cut around the designs.",
        "If your paper is solid colored, you can cut your own shapes, such as hearts and stars.",
        "Consider arranging your design on the table in front of you before you glue it down onto the box.",
        "This will allow you to fix any mistakes.",
        "It will also allow you to experiment with different shapes and layering until you get the look you want.",
        "Once you put the paper down onto the Mod Podge, it will be difficult to move it without ruining it.",
        "Set the box down on its side in front of you.",
        "You will be working on one side of the box at a time so that your work surface does not get all sticky.",
        "If your box comes with a lid, take the lid off and work on it separately.",
        "Use a foam brush to apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to a small patch on the box.",
        "You will be working in small areas at a time so that the Mod Podge does not dry out before you get to it.",
        "If you can't find any Mod Podge or decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing one part white school glue with one part water.",
        "Press the paper down onto the glue.",
        "You can place the shapes down individually, or overlap them to create new designs.",
        "For example, you can paste a flower shape down onto some leaf shapes.",
        "If you are overlapping shapes, be sure to coat the bottom shape with Mod Podge so that the top shape will stick.",
        "Let the glue dry before working on another side of the box.",
        "Once the glue dries, flip or rotate the box and continue decoupaging pieces of paper onto it.",
        "Cover the entire box with another thin layer of Mod Podge.",
        "This will help seal in your work.",
        "You can use the same finish that you were using before (such as gloss, matte, or satin).",
        "You can also try using a glittery one for some extra sparkle.",
        "Allow the box to dry completely before putting anything inside it.",
        "If you put the lid on too soon, it will get stuck to the box, and the receiver will have a hard time opening it."
