If you want additional seasoning, sprinkle more salt and pepper over the top. Cover and bake the liver and onions for 45 minutes. Put the lid on the roasting dish or cover it tightly with aluminum foil. Put the dish in the preheated oven and cook the meal for 45 minutes. The liver will be almost cooked and the onions will soften. Put sugar and soy sauce over the liver and bake it for 15 more minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and take off the lid. Scatter 1/4 cup (50 g) of brown sugar over the liver and pour 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of soy sauce on top. Bake the liver for 15 more minutes. Put the lid back on and return the pan to the oven so the liver finishes cooking. If you aren't sure if the liver is done, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the a liver. The temperature should read 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Rest the liver for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Turn off the oven and remove the pan from the oven. Leave the liver to rest it finishes cooking. Then serve the liver and onion with mashed potatoes, crusty bread, creamed corn, or a green salad. Store leftover liver in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 or 4 days. Stir-Frying Italian Liver and Onions Saut\u00e9 the onions with thyme and sage for 20 minutes over medium heat. Pour in 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of the oil into a heavy skillet and turn the burner to medium. Once the oil shimmers, stir in 1 1/2 onions that you've sliced into 1/4 in (6 mm) slices along with 1/2 teaspoon (0.5 g) of the dried thyme and 1/2 teaspoon (0.5 g) of the dried sage. Stir the onions frequently to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the skillet. Remove the onions and saut\u00e9 1 garlic clove for 2 minutes. Spoon the saut\u00e9ed onions to a bowl and keep the burner at medium heat. Pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil. Stir in the flattened clove of garlic and let it cook until it turns golden brown. Turn off the burner and discard the garlic clove. This will make a garlic-infused oil that you will use to cook the liver. Mix the flour, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. Measure 2 tablespoons (18 g) of all-purpose flour into a shallow plate. Stir in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon (0.5 g) of dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon (0.5 g) of dried sage, and salt and pepper. You can also put the dry ingredients into a sealable plastic bag. Dry 12 ounces (340 g) of calf's liver and cut it into 2 in (5 cm) strips. Use paper towels to pat the liver completely dry and place it on a cutting board. Take a sharp knife and cut the liver into evenly sized strips. Coat the liver in the seasoned flour. Put the strips of liver into the plate with the seasoned flour. Turn the strips over so they're covered with the flour. If you put the flour in a bag, place the strips of liver into it and seal the bag shut. Shake the bag so the liver is completely coated. Add the butter to the skillet and turn the burner to medium-high. Put 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14 g) of butter into the garlic oil. Heat the butter until it melts and the oil shimmers. Stir-fry the liver strips for 3 minutes. Lower the coated liver strips into the skillet and stir the liver strips constantly so they turn golden brown on the outside. Keep in mind that they won't be cooked completely. Shake the excess flour off of the liver strips before you add them to the skillet. This will prevent them from becoming soggy as they cook. Add the saut\u00e9ed onions and stir-fry the mixture for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions from the bowl to the skillet. Stir and cook the liver and onion mixture until the liver strips are just cooked through to the center. Serve the stir-fried liver.

For example, spoon the stir fry over rice, cooked potatoes, or boiled noodles. Refrigerate leftover liver and onions in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days.

Once the coals are hot and ashy, dump them on the center of the grill grate. Set a grill pan on the grill to heat up while you prepare the liver. Pat 1 pound (450 g) of beef liver dry and cut it into 1/2 in (1.3 cm) slices. If the liver is bloody, rinse it with cold water. Then use paper towels to pat it completely dry. Take a sharp knife and cut the liver into thin slices and set them aside on the cutting board. If tough veins are visible, cut them off. Mix the olive oil with garlic, mint, salt, and pepper. Get out a small bowl and pour \u20442 cup (120 ml) of olive oil into it.

If you prefer to use a different herb, substitute basil or parsley for the mint. Brush both sides of the liver with the marinade. Dip a basting brush into the marinade and spread it over the liver slices on the cutting board. Turn the slices and brush the other side with the marinade. Then put the liver slices in the hot grill pan. You might have to nestle the liver slices next to each other depending on the size of your grill pan. Ensure that they're in a single layer.
