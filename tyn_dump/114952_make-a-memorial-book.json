Pick out which ones are most meaningful to you, your family, and the friends of the deceased. Photographs should represent their life, personality, and milestones. If the photos are digital, you can organize them in files on your computer. You might organize them by date, theme, or relevance. Or, you can put them on a flash drive and print them out. If the photographs are physical copies, you should scan and digitize them before putting them in a book. This saves the original while giving you plenty of copies to work with. If you do not own a scanner, check out your local public library to see if they offer scanning services. If you are having trouble choosing, you can look for the major milestones of their life: baby pictures, graduations, weddings, award ceremonies, vacations, and other big events. Invite family members and friends to add their photos to the book. You can do this at the funeral service, through letters, or over email."

        "Cut out the card stock, and paste the photograph to it before putting it in the scrapbook.",
        "If your loved one traveled frequently, you can find stickers of different flags and places to put next to their travel pictures.",
        "While your scrapbook probably came with plain paper pages, you can also buy colorful pages or pages with print designs."
