For example, if you need 1 cup (100 g) of crushed Oreos, place 1 cup (or about 12 whole cookies) of whole Oreos in the food processor. Depending on how much crushed Oreos you'll need, you may need to crush the cookies in batches so they'll fit in your food processor."

Depending on how powerful your blender or food processor is, the Oreos should become crumbs. If your blender is deep, the cookies may become stuck underneath the blade. Stop the machine and either push the cookies closer to the blades or use a wooden spoon to stir and dislodge any stuck cookies before you continue to crush them."
