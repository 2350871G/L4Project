Making a Side Fringe Dress Spread a large, baggy T-shirt on a flat surface. Pick a large T-shirt that is at least 3 sizes too big for you.

You will be wearing the shirt with the neck around your chest, just below the armpits. The neck hole needs to be big enough to accommodate this. Something that is 3 sizes too big for you would be ideal. The shirt needs to be long enough to cover your hips and upper thighs. Put the shirt on and pull it under your armpits. Pull your head, shoulders, and arms through the neck hole of the shirt. Tug the shirt down so that it sits around your chest, just below your armpits. The arms should be hanging loosely at your sides. If the shirt feels too tight, take it off. Cut the collar off, then put it back on again. Tie the arms behind your back if you want a simple look. Grab both arms of the T-shirt, and pull them behind your back. Tie them into a tight knot so that they cinch the extra fabric. If you are worried about the knot coming undone, tie a second knot.
