If you have long, thick hair, you may need up to 8 tablespoons (120 mL) to cover your whole head.

To begin, scoop or pour \u20442 cup (120 mL) to 1 cup (240 mL) of plain, unflavored yogurt into a bowl, depending on how long and thick your hair is. You can use regular yogurt or Greek yogurt. Make sure that you use unflavored yogurt, as some flavored yogurts contain fruits and/or additives that may be harmful to your hair. Mix in a raw egg, olive oil, essential oils, and/or honey. To add nutrients to your yogurt conditioner, mix in 1 egg, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil, about 6 drops of your favorite essential oils, or about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of honey for every \u20442 cup (120 mL) of yogurt. You can mix all of these at once, or just add one or a few of these add-ins depending on your hair type and desired effect. Olive oil and honey can help prevent breakage and promote hair growth, while eggs may help promote healthy growth. Essential oils, such as lavender and peppermint, add nutrients and can help mask any unpleasant smells. Apply the yogurt conditioner to clean, shampooed hair. Using your hands, apply the yogurt conditioner to your hair little by little, working through one section of hair at a time. Repeat this process until all of your hair is covered and you have used all of the yogurt conditioner. It might be a good idea to wear clothes that you don\u2019t mind staining, or you can wrap a towel around your shoulders to protect your clothing. Let the yogurt conditioner rest in your hair for 15 to 20 minutes. This will give your hair ample time to absorb the nutrients from the yogurt and any add-ins. You can leave your hair uncovered, or you can protect your clothes and surroundings by putting on a shower cap, or by lightly wrapping your hair in a towel. Rinse out thoroughly with warm water. Either in the shower or carefully over the sink, wash the yogurt out of your hair completely. If you have added in olive oil, honey, or an egg, you will likely need use your regular shampoo again in order to fully remove the treatment from your hair. Shampooing may also help you get rid of any lingering dairy smell. Dry and style your hair as usual. Reapply your yogurt conditioner every other week. For best results, condition your hair with yogurt every other week. You can try out different add-ins to find what works best for your hair.",
