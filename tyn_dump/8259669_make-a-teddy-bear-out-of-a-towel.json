Take 1 of the narrow edges and fold it just past the center, about 2/3 of the way. Double-check your proportions by folding the towel into thirds, then unfolding 1 of the ends. If this is for a baby shower, match the color of the towel to the gender. If you don't know the baby's gender, use a neutral color, such as yellow. A solid color will work the best, but you can use a print too, such as paisley."
