Put a small amount of shampoo in the paper cup and fill it with water. If you want, you can fill it with hand soap and water but shampoo smells better and will give your Barbie a more realistic bath. Dip a cotton ball in the shampoo and rub it all over your dolls hair. Make sure you cover all of her hair. Rub the shampoo into the dolls hair until you see suds, just like you do for yourself.  Rinse your dolls hair under the tap until all the shampoo is gone.  Rinse your paper cup.  Put a small amount of body soap in the paper cup and fill it with water. If you want you can fill it with hand soap and water. Dip a cotton ball in the body soap and rub it on your doll's body, making sure you get all the dirt off and clean her very well.  Rinse her thoroughly.  Dry her hair and body.  Brush her hair softly, getting all the knots out, so it's nice and smooth. Make sure you brush it gently to avoid pulling out a lot of hair. Don't be afraid if some hair falls out. Hair Makeover Wait until your dolls hair is dry.  Colour her hair in with a washable marker. This will only last for a day or two. You can rinse it off later with soap and hot water. To colour it permanently, use a permanent marker. Make sure you want to do it though because it won't come off once you've done it.
