                    "description": "There are plenty of glass cleaners available, but some of them are better at preventing streaks than others. If you\u2019re planning on using a commercial product, try an ammonia-based cleaner. Ammonia evaporates quickly, so it doesn\u2019t leave streaks. Many inexpensive cleaners have tons of soap and should be avoided. If you are unable to find ammonia-based glass cleaners, look for ones with isopropyl alcohol instead. Isopropyl alcohol doesn\u2019t have a harsh smell like ammonia does. Both ammonia and isopropyl alcohol are considered environmentally-friendly when they have been diluted in water, like with glass cleaners."

                    "description": "You can easily make an effective, environmentally-friendly cleaner from a few household ingredients. One example is to mix equal amounts of water and white vinegar. You could also replace some or all of the vinegar with other ingredients, like isopropyl alcohol or lemon juice. If you don\u2019t have vinegar, substitute in an equal amount of isopropyl alcohol or lemon juice instead. If you choose to mix them with vinegar, try combining them in equal amounts. For instance, combine about 1 cup (240 mL) of water with 1 cup (240 mL) of isopropyl alcohol and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar. This will make a quick-drying cleaner that doesn\u2019t leave streaks. Plain water isn\u2019t enough to clean glass without leaving streaks. Mixing in soap doesn\u2019t solve the problem, either."
