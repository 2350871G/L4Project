This can take several days depending on how injured your wrists are. Resting the wrists can reduce inflammation and prevent more damage to the muscles around your wrists. Some movement may help your wrists, however, by maintaining your range of motion. You can do normal daily activities, such as typing or cleaning."

To do wrist circles, slowly roll your wrist clockwise up to 10 times. Next, go counterclockwise for 10 times. If you need support,  wear wrist splints while you do normal daily activities to prevent re-injury. Buy wrist splints from a pharmacy or supermarket.
