If you'd like to be certain, contact the manufacturer and ask whether your model is standard or reverse threaded onto the drill spindle. This can bend or crack the drill casing if the strike is too forceful or at an angle. Start with light force and increase if necessary.

Changing a Tapered Drill Chuck Measure the diameter of the spindle. Keyed drill chucks do not typically thread onto the drill. Instead, the chuck's tapered end inserts onto a matching spindle. Look at the gap between the chuck base and the drill, and you should see this spindle. Measure its diameter. Buy a chuck removal wedge. This is a cheap, two-armed wedge. Choose one with a gap between the two arms larger than the spindle diameter, but as close to it in size as possible. If you're in a hurry, skip to the end of this section for another method. Insert the wedge between the chuck and the drill. Position the two arms of the wedge around the spindle in this gap. Hammer the wedge in.
