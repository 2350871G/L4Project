                    "description": "Acetone is a chemical that reacts with the gel nail to loosen its adhesive and free it from your natural nail. Acetone is a common ingredient in nail polish remover, but in order to remove gels, you need a concentrated amount of pure acetone. Cover the bowl of acetone with plastic wrap or foil. Use a rubber band to hold the cover in place. Place the acetone in a larger bowl of warm water, so the acetone warms up. Let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes. Then remove the acetone from the outer bowl to prevent overheating. Be careful with this process, because acetone is flammable. Keep the acetone away from any direct heat sources, and warm only gently and with care."

If you don't have plain petroleum jelly, use a lotion or balm that lists it as an ingredient. Dip a cotton swab in the petroleum jelly and use it to apply the petroleum jelly around the edges of your nails. Cover the skin on your fingers down just below your top knuckles. Don't get too much jelly on your nails, since the acetone needs to be able to dissolve the gel."

Repeat with your remaining nails. Let your nails soak in acetone for 30 minutes. If acetone doesn't irritate your skin, you can dip your nails straight into the bowl instead of using cotton balls and aluminum foil. Make sure not to soak them like this for more than 30 minutes."

If it does, repeat the process with your remaining nails. You may have to help the gel come off by peeling it back a bit. If the gel on your test nail is still firmly in place, replace the acetone-soaked cotton ball, wrap it up in foil, and let your nails sit for another 10 minutes before trying again, continuing until the adhesive is softened and the nails can be removed. If this method doesn't work within one hour, the adhesive is probably resistant to acetone and another method should be employed."
