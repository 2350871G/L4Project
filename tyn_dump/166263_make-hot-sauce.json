    "text": " Hot sauce #1 Choose your peppers. Pepper selection is important. This will determine how mild or hot your sauce will be. Here is a small list of peppers and how they taste:\n\nJalape\u00f1os: These peppers are ideal for making mild sauces. They have a strong flavor with less kick than other peppers. They are typically green and about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) with a curved shape. They look a little \"stubby\". Serranos: These peppers look like jalape\u00f1os but are twice as hot. Use these peppers for a hotter sauce. They look similar to jalape\u00f1os but are not as wide. They're green when they're not ripe, but the color varies when they do ripen. Pequin:  These peppers look like small red berries. They have a unique flavor and are very hot. The difficulty encountered when using this pepper is obtaining a large enough quantity to make a good sauce. Habanero: This pepper is one of the hottest of all peppers. Use this pepper if you want to burn your mouth with fire. It looks shriveled and is usually bright orange or red. Bhut Jolokia: The \"ghost chili\" at over one million Scoville units. This rare chili comes from parts of India. Select the appropriate quantity of peppers for your taste. After selecting the pepper, you should further determine the heat your sauce by deciding on the appropriate quantity of peppers. Mild sauce will use half a pound (.23 kg) and hot will use 2 pounds (.9 kg). Mince one clove of garlic.  Dice one half of a large onion.  Mix the garlic, onion, hot peppers (after taking seeds out) and 16 ounces (473 ml) of tomato sauce in a food processor. Puree the mix until all thick chunks are gone. Place the mix in a frying pan. Cook on low to medium heat until simmering. Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar.  Strain hot sauce into a jar.  Finished.  Hot sauce #2 Remove the stems from the peppers. Slice into 1 inch/2.5cm slices. Mince the shallots and garlic.  Pour the water into a saucepan. Add the salt. Simmer for a few minutes. Add the mango nectar.  Remove from the heat. Add the vinegar. Pour into a blender. Pulse until smooth. Pour into suitable bottles or jars. Follow proper sterilization procedures. Label and date, the store.",
