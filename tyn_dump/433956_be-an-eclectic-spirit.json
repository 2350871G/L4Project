            "description": "Being an eclectic spirit means having a lot of interests, or finding beauty in items/ thoughts/ experiences that are classically not appreciated. This can run the gamut. You can branch out by studying a subject that is not widely studied amongst your friends. And of that subject, be sure to dig deeply. If you are studying poetry, for example, maybe read the works by newer, or less famous, authors, too. Or perhaps you are involved in a particular activity that sets you apart from the rest, but you have to remember that you have to love this activity yourself, and you're not just participating in it because you want to be 'eccentric/eclectic'."

Even if you alone appreciate the items. That is the essence of eccentricity, it seems. The eccentric will act in a genuine manner - not dismayed by the actions of those around her/him. An eclectic will typically have a multitude of interests, and will be in constant reflection on these items, experiences, features of life. An eccentric eclectic will then typically have a vast and sundry array of interests, but will not camouflage/ hide her interests. She will live authentically."

Eccentricity is so rare, partly, because most people are hiding who they are, or acting a role. Don't worry about appearing more or less eccentric or eclectic. Be open to new experiences (but don't necessarily 'embrace' everything!) Be open to the possibility of what a new experience will bring to your life, without necessarily HAVING to engage in this new way of being. For example, if a friend wants you to try yoga, try asking yourself \"why? should I? I might like it\" - don't necessarily say \"no\" off the hop. At the same time, if - and only after you've given a topic some thought - do not want to do something, don't force yourself to do it."

There is, for example, oftentimes huge debates over the subject of art - and what should be allowed in art, be allowed by an artist. One artist was found starving dogs for performance art. Now, despite the fact that this is a very 'different' way of trying to be artistic, the plain fact of the matter is that if you care AT ALL about animals, this story is horrifying. So it doesn't matter how unique, cutting edge, etc someone/ or something is... If it doesn't sit right in your soul, AVOID going down that path."

This does not mean that your essence is changing. If anything, by learning new stuff, reading more and LIVING more, you are simply going to learn more about yourself, too.

If you love something, pursue it, and create your own fashion. A great way to do this is to go to thrift stores, and also learn how to make alterations with a sewing machine. Thrift stores carry such a wide array of styles in clothing, that you experiment.

It means being appreciative of the beauty that has existed in various forms throughout history, and not ignoring or devaluing past contributions simply because they are of the past."

At the heart of an eccentric being is an egoless being. This is not the same thing as having no personality. Simply...not being egoistic - not being so full of yourself, as most adults are, that every word you speak is measured, and compared to the words of others. Or every purchase you make is with another person in mind, rather than yourself. If you are buying yourself an item of clothing - go with what you love, not what others TELL you THEY love. If someone else loves your style - terrific! That's great. Flattering, yes? But don't change your style to accommodate a parent, sibling, uber-controlling boyfriend etc."

Maybe they can see that we are headed down a self destructive path, for example, and want to offer advice. It is always smart to listen, to question. But if someone has a history of trying to change you into a different person, simply because they hold an idealized form of who you are or could be - and the changes would be entirely superficial - try not to be swayed. Sometimes parents want their children to always remain \"cute\" or dependent. This is understandable, but not the best for YOU and your personal growth. If there is a character that you love, whose fashion style you love etc. - look to her as a model for ideas. This is not stealing. Very often you will find that you do not like a style of dress on your own being as much as you like it on the character. You may be totally infatuated, even, with a character and may aim to 'change' yourself to be more like the character. To a point, this isn't really harmful, because if there behavior is in sync with what you love and how you'd like to be (say, more confident, or more outspoken, or more carefree etc.) then it possibly is a positive change. But remember - you don't have to change every aspect of your behavior to have improvement. If you have traits that are holding you back, then work on those, but don't idolize another for being 'better' than you. A more confident person is not better than you, simply because she or he is more confident. Everyone has problems, or areas of their life on which they need to work. No one is perfect."

        "A clean, tidy and/or calming \"you\" space. Nothing ruins the creative mind like stress. Sometimes we can't avoid being around stressful people - but sometimes we can make things better. Clean up your living space! If you have your own room, delight that you do! Get rid of things that are not you, or things from a time when you were trying to be a person you are not. Pack them up, if you are not sure (don't chuck out anything in a rash move!) If you have old mementos from childhood, keep them safe - display those that cheer you up, or keep them close. Organize and BETTER your environment. Make it the best it can be! Even if you have very little money, you can probably get unique pot holders for plants (and may even find wild flowers or portable plants outdoors if are lucky enough to live near a more rural area). For images/ posters - put up your own artwork, if you like your own stuff. Or put up the childish scrawling of a special piece from a young child, or your own work from when little. Or even head down to the library and make colour photocopies or any art piece or painting from any book. The possibilities are endless!",
