Mix together 2 tablespoons of baby shampoo, 2 tablespoons of any type of cooking oil and 2 tablespoons of baking soda in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a container. Put a cap on the container and shake it until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Pour a small amount of the solution into a spray bottle. Spray a few hidden leaves on plants infected with downy mildew. Wait 24 to 36 hours and then check the leaves for brown or yellow spots, brown tips or pale scorched leaves. These are all symptoms of phytotoxicity, which can occur in some plants when they are treated with this remedy."
