At the very least, you will probably need to get inspection and clearance from the local utility companies to start digging so that you don\u2019t damage any buried utility lines. Dig an oversized window well outside where you will add the window. It needs to be at least 36 in (91 cm) wide and extend 36 in (91 cm) out from where the window will go. It will also need to be no more than 44 in (110 cm) deep. Warning \n Make sure there are no buried utilities, such as electrical wires or pipes, before you start digging.

If you have a deep basement that forces you to dig the window well deeper than 44 in (110 cm), then most codes will still allow you to install the window as long as you put some sort of ladder or steps in the window well to provide access. Measure and mark your cut on the inside wall of your basement. Use a measuring tape to measure the outline of the window according to the dimensions you determined. Mark each side with a grease pencil and a straight edge. Make sure you leave about 6 in (15 cm) of header space between the top of the window and the floor joists if you are placing it perpendicular to the joists. This way the floor joist still have part of the wall to rest on. If you don\u2019t have a grease pencil, you can use masking tape as an alternative to mark the outline of the window.

Align the studs directly underneath the joists and screw the top plate to the joists. The frame will need to be at least as wide as the window, so that you will have 1 stud of the frame under each joist that runs above the window.

Make slits in the sheeting so you can staple it between the joists and create an extra-tight seal. Cut a groove around the inside perimeter of the window with a concrete saw. Use a 14 in (36 cm) concrete saw with a diamond blade. Make a first pass around the perimeter and only cut about \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) deep to create a straight groove that will guide your next, deeper cuts.

You can rent a concrete saw. Renting a diamond blade is also recommended. Wear hearing and eye protection, a dust mask, and gloves when operating the saw.

The groove you made will guide your cut so you can focus on applying pressure to cut deeper. Don\u2019t worry about whether the cut is exactly halfway through the wall.

Putting in the Window Knock out the blocks where the hole will be with a 4 lb (1.8 kg) hammer. Start at the top-center and work carefully around the edges. Be careful not to loosen the blocks that will remain in place. If there are any blocks that are hard to knock out, start by breaking out the core of the block and then break away the rest.
