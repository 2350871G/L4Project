Look all around your house for areas that have the space and privacy you need. An attic or basement would be perfect, since they\u2019ll be out of plain sight. You could also put your hideout in your own bedroom, or right in the middle of the living room. Putting your hideout in the family room is a good way to get a little more privacy without being too far away from the things you want to do. Depending on the weather, you might be able to build a hideout outside. Just make sure you\u2019re somewhere near your house where it\u2019s safe, and be sure to hurry inside if it looks like it might rain."
