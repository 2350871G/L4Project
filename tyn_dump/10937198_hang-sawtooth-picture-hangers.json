Repeat this action on the opposite side. The nail will be really short so it doesn't go through the front of the frame, so be careful to not catch your fingers with the hammer. Some sawtooth kits come with nails, and some come with screws. Use whatever came with your kit to ensure the hanger is properly attached. If it came with screws, you'll need to use a screwdriver rather than a hammer. The sawtooth hanger needs to be attached to the frame. Even if there is sturdy canvas paper covering the back of the picture, chances are the hanger will just rip through it once you place the picture up on the wall."
