    "text": " Sewing a Simple Pillow Select your fabric. Cut 2 x 10 in (25 cm) squares of fabric. Choose a fabric that matches your wedding colors. It can be anything you like: satin, cotton, burlap, etc. If the fabric has a print, make sure that it goes with your wedding theme. You can make the pillow a different size but make sure to add a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) seam to the length and width. Stack the squares with the right sides together. Set the first square with the right side up. Place the second square on top, with the right side facing down. Secure the edges with pins. Sew three of the edges with a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance. This is fastest using a sewing machine, but it can be sewn by hand too. Use a straight stitch and a matching thread color. If you don't know how to sew, secure the edges with hot glue or fabric glue. Allow the glue to dry before continuing. Trim the corners. While not absolutely necessary, this will reduce bulk and help your pillow look nicer. Cut as close to the stitching as possible without cutting through the thread. Be sure to clip the corners along the edge you left open. This will make it easier to sew it shut later. Turn the pillow right side out. Flip the corners into the pillow, then pull them out through the opening. Use something blunt and pointy, like a knitting needle or pencil to push the corners out further. Stuff the pillow. Polyester stuffing will work the best. You can use other types of filling, such as foam or a blank ring pillow. Close the open seam. Push the stuffing into the pillow so that it does not stick out. Fold the raw edges of the opening in by \u20444 inch (0.64 cm), then secure them with sewing pins. Hand sew the opening shut with a ladder stitch, then remove the pins. If you don't want to sew, hot glue the opening. Work on 1 inch (2.5 cm) at a time. Press and hold the section until it sets before doing the next section. You can use fabric glue on the opening. Work on 1 inch (2.5 cm) at a time. Secure each section with a clothespin until the glue dries. Attach a string to a ribbon with a slipknot. Choose a piece of ribbon and string that match your pillow. Fold the string in half to make a loop that is positioned behind the ribbon. Pull the ends of the string to make a knot around the ribbon, then tug on them to tighten the knot. Slide the knot across the ribbon until it is centered. For a fancier pillow, use a \u204416 or \u20448 in (1.6 or 3.2 mm) ribbon instead of string. The ribbon will make the decorative bow. The string will allow you to tie the rings to the pillow. Form the ribbon into a bow. Fold the left and right ends of the ribbon into loops. Cross the left loop over the right loop, then thread it through the gap that you made. Tug on the loops to tighten the bow. Leave the strings out of the bow. Secure the bow. Position the bow in the middle of the pillow. You can sew the bow on with matching thread or hot glue the bow instead. Make sure that the strings and the tails of the bow are hanging below the loop. If you want to create a tufted pillow, sew a few stitches through the middle of the pillow first. Click here to learn more. Trim and singe the ribbon and strings. Cut the ribbon and strings down to the length you want. If the material is fraying, singe the ends with a flame. Tie the rings to the strings. Thread both of the rings onto one of the strings. Tie both strings into a knot or a bow. Making a No-Sew Pillow Cut 2 x 10 in (25 cm) squares of fabric. This method will give a rustic look, so a heavy fabric like burlap, linen, or canvas will work best. Choose a color that matches your wedding theme. If the fabric has a print on it, make sure that the print is suitable. If you want the pillow a different size, add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the length and width. Clip the corners by \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). This will reduce bulk when you fold the fabric. It will also help conceal the raw edges. Set the seams. Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the four edges down by \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) towards the wrong side. Press the fabric with an iron, if needed. Repeat this step for the second piece of fabric. Burlap holds folds and creases easily, so you do not need to press it with an iron. Glue the hems down. Unfold one of the edges. Draw a thin line of hot glue or fabric glue along the edge, then press it back down. Do this for all of the \u20444 in (0.64 cm) hems on both fabric squares. Hot glue sets within minutes, but fabric glue needs about 10 to 15 minutes to dry. Trim any frayed bits of fabric sticking out. Glue the squares. Set the first square down with the wrong side up. Place your second square on top, with the right side up. Glue three of the edges together using hot glue or fabric glue. Leave the fourth edge open and allow the glue to dry. Make sure that the entire \u20444 in (0.64 cm) width of each hem is coated with glue. This will give you a flanged seam. Stuff the pillow to your desired fullness. Polyester stuffing will work the best, but you can also use a piece of foam or a mini pillow insert. You can also use a plain ring pillow, as long as it is the same size. Glue the final seam. Use your fingers to push the stuffing into the pillow so that it does not get caught in the glue. Working 1 inch (2.5 cm) at a time, glue the final seam down. If you are working with hot glue, press and hold each section until it dries before moving onto the next. If you are working with fabric glue, secure the section with a clothespin, before moving onto the next section. Remove the pins once the glue dries. Secure a string to a ribbon with a slip knot. Choose a coordinating ribbon and cord that match your pillow. Fold the string in half, then place it behind the ribbon to make a loop. Pull the ends of the string over the ribbon and through the loop. Pull on the ends of the string to tighten the knot. Center the string. If it isn't, slide it across the ribbon until it is. The ribbon will form the decorative bow. The string will secure the rings to the pillow. Tie the ribbon into a bow. Take the left and right sides of the ribbon, and fold them into loops. Cross the left loop over the right loop, then thread it through the hole you made. Pull on the loops to tighten the bow. Do not include the string in the bow. Tug on the ribbon loops and tails to adjust the bow. Glue the bow. Place a large drop of hot glue or fabric glue in the middle of the pillow. Adjust the bow so that the tails and strings hang below the loops. Press the bow into the glue and let it set. Trim and singe the ribbon and string. If the ribbon tails or the strings are too long, trim them to the length you want. If the material is fraying, singe them with a flame. Tie the rings to the pillow. Thread both rings onto the left string and tie both strings together into a simple knot. You can also tie the strings into a bow for a fancier look. Decorating a Ring Pillow Tie a ribbon around a pillow. Cut a length of ribbon at least 4 times the width of the pillow. Center the pillow over the ribbon. Wrap the ribbon ends around the sides of the pillow. Tie the ribbon into a knot in the front of the pillow. Add the rings, then tie the ribbon into a bow. Add a symbolic charm to the bow. Choose a charm that is meaningful, such as a horseshoe for good luck, or a heart for love. Sew it to the pillow under the bow, or slide it onto the ribbon before tying it into a bow. Embellish a pillow with ribbon rosettes. Purchase miniature ribbon roses or rosettes. If they are attached to wire stems, trim the stems down to just beneath the bud. Hot glue the rosettes to your pillow as desired. Adding them around the bow would be ideal. Create a tufted look. Sew a few stitches through the center of the pillow. Thread a needle and push it through the front of the pillow and out the back. Move the needle over \u20448 to \u20444 inch (0.32 to 0.64 cm), then push it from the back and out the front. Do this one more time to create an X. Knot and cut the thread. Cover the X in the front of the pillow with a ribbon bow. Add a corded trim and tassels for a lavish touch. Hot glue thin cording to the seams of your pillow. Make some tassels using matching embroidery thread. Sew them to the corners of the pillow. Silver and gold colors make for great accents, but other colors can also be used. If you prefer not to use hot glue, try fabric glue. You can also sew the cord using a whipstitch. Creating Fancier Pillows Make a different shape for a unique touch. This may not work well for no-sew pillows, but it is a great option for sewn pillows. Cut two identical shapes out of the desired fabric and sew them together. Leave a 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) gap. Turn the pillow, stuff it, then sew the gap shut. Try a circle, heart, or rectangle shape. Remember to clip corners and cut V-shaped notches into curved edges. Experiment with different fabric choices. Instead of using satin for the pillow, try a unique fabric, such as burlap. You can also use a fancy embroidered fabric for the front with a plain fabric for the back. Look in the prom and formal section of the fabric store. You'll find all sorts of fancy fabrics including ones with rosettes! Add a lace overlay before assembling the pillow. Cut a third square of lace fabric. Sew it to the right side of the first fabric square with a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance. Assemble the pillow using the Simple Pillow method. Other fabric options include chiffon and organza. For a unique touch, use a strip of lace ribbon. Cut it to the width of the square, and sew the short ends down. You can do this with the glued pillow method. Simply glue the edges of the lace and fabric together. Add ruffled trims. Before you assemble the pillow, pin the trim to the right side of one square fabric piece. Align the edges of the trim with the edges of the fabric. Pin then sew it together using a \u20448 in (0.32 cm) seam allowance. Remove the pins, then sew the pillow as directed in the sewing method. Ruffled lace trims look more romantic or you can use a fabric lace. Embroider the fabric. Before assembling, Embroider the front piece of fabric by hand or with an embroidery machine. Assemble the pillow using one of the first two methods. The embroidery can be as simple or as detailed as you want it to be. Simple embroidery works best for rustic pillows, such as burlap, linen, or canvas. Detailed embroidery works best for fancier fabrics, such as silk, satin, or velvet. Finished. ",
