Next, take the right section, and cross it over the new middle section. Pull your sections tight enough so that the braid is smooth, but don't pull them so tight that they feel uncomfortable. Once you\u2019ve finished your French braid you can make your style more comfortable by loosening any overly tight box braids.

The French braid, however, is a temporary style and can be taken out at the end of the day. If you wrap your hair in a silk scarf before sleeping, you may be able to make it last for up to 2 days."
