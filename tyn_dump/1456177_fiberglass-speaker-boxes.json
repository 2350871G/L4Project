If you're working in the trunk or any part of the car that has carpeting, it advisable to remove it. Lay plastic covering around the area where you want the speaker enclosure. Cover any surface where you do not want resin dust. Tape the edges of the plastic down. Place 2 layers of masking tape on the surface you will fiberglass. Criss-cross the layers to ensure that the area is fully covered. Mix up a small batch of resin in a bowl. The amount depends on the size of the speaker box you want to make.

Strips that are 2 inches (5 cm) wide and 1 foot (0.30 m) (30 cm) long should be adequate. Cut the strips into smaller pieces if you are fitting them into a tight space. Dip the strips of fiberglass cloth into the resin. Saturate them, but do not soak them so much that you drip resin everywhere. Carefully place the strips over the taped area one at a time.
