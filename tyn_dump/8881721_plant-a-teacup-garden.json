Sculpting Model Mushrooms and Houses for Your Teacup Garden Determine whether you'd like to add more features to the teacup garden. While this section is optional, adding miniature items does create a sweet atmosphere that draws the viewer's eye in for closer observation. You can add already made small items, or you can make some from modeling clay and craft items. The following steps give instructions for making your own miniature mushrooms and houses to add to the teacup. Create mushrooms with air-dry modeling compound. Open the modeling compound and separate off roughly a marble\u2019s worth. Roll this into a ball with your hands. Pinch the ball at one end and pull the compound away from the central ball to form a stem. Insert a small piece of floral wire through the stem into the cap of the mushroom to extend the wire out of the bottom of the stem. The length of the floral wire will vary depending on the size of the mushrooms. Generally, there should be enough emerging from the bottom to allow you to handle it easily. You can make longer lasting, sturdier decorations using polymer clay. Follow the clay's directions for the best results. In most cases, polymer clay must be baked for it to harden. Form the base of miniature houses with the compound. Double the amount of compound you used for mushrooms and roll it into a ball with your hands. Shape the ball into a rectangular box for the base of the house. Use a toothpick to add fine details to the base of the house. Create little squares for windows with the toothpick. Even small indentations made with the toothpick will appear like tiny windows. Add a central rectangle shape for the front door. Add a roof and finish the house.

Extra wire should emerge from the bottom of the house similarly to the sculpted mushrooms. If the house is connected by floral wire alone, it may be unstable.

It can be either an indoor or an outdoor garden, although it needs to be sheltered if outside, to prevent breakage or over-drying of the plants, since they're growing in only a little soil. Most teacup gardens are kept indoors but there is no harm placing them on a sheltered patio, balcony or even in a herb or kitchen garden area.

        "The following steps give instructions for making your own miniature mushrooms and houses to add to the teacup.",
        "Create mushrooms with air-dry modeling compound.",
        "Open the modeling compound and separate off roughly a marble\u2019s worth.",
        "Roll this into a ball with your hands.",
        "Pinch the ball at one end and pull the compound away from the central ball to form a stem.",
        "Insert a small piece of floral wire through the stem into the cap of the mushroom to extend the wire out of the bottom of the stem.",
        "The length of the floral wire will vary depending on the size of the mushrooms.",
        "Generally, there should be enough emerging from the bottom to allow you to handle it easily.",
        "You can make longer lasting, sturdier decorations using polymer clay.",
        "Follow the clay's directions for the best results.",
        "In most cases, polymer clay must be baked for it to harden.",
        "Form the base of miniature houses with the compound.",
        "Double the amount of compound you used for mushrooms and roll it into a ball with your hands.",
        "Shape the ball into a rectangular box for the base of the house.",
        "Use a toothpick to add fine details to the base of the house.",
        "Create little squares for windows with the toothpick.",
        "Even small indentations made with the toothpick will appear like tiny windows.",
        "Add a central rectangle shape for the front door.",
        "Add a roof and finish the house.",
        "Take a marble-sized amount of compound and form it into a triangle or cone for the roof.",
        "Push floral wire through the bottom of the rectangle into the roof to connect both pieces.",
        "Extra wire should emerge from the bottom of the house similarly to the sculpted mushrooms.",
        "If the house is connected by floral wire alone, it may be unstable.",
        "Increase the stability by adding more floral wires or attaching the top and bottom parts using a dot of hot glue.",
        "Paint your models.",
        "The floral wire of models can be stuck into floral foam to make painting easier.",
        "Add a small amount of paint to a palette or paper plate.",
        "Dip your brush in the paint and apply your base layer.",
        "For example, for mushrooms this will likely be red.",
        "Once the red base layer is dry, you can add white spots.",
        "Add accents to your teacup garden models.",
        "Attach Spanish moss to the roofs of the houses with a little hot glue.",
        "Feel free to experiment with different colors.",
        "Coordinate your color schemes with the natural colors of your plants.",
        "Add the models to your teacup garden.",
        "Simply stick the floral wire into an open patch of dirt in the teacup garden to add any model to it.",
        "Arrange several houses together to make it look like you have a miniature village tucked away in your teacup garden.",
        "Displaying the Teacup Garden Decide where to place the teacup garden.",
        "It can be either an indoor or an outdoor garden, although it needs to be sheltered if outside, to prevent breakage or over-drying of the plants, since they're growing in only a little soil.",
        "Most teacup gardens are kept indoors but there is no harm placing them on a sheltered patio, balcony or even in a herb or kitchen garden area.",
        "Consider making a display of several teacup gardens together.",
        "One teacup garden alone is fine but you can create even more impact and interest by arranging several teacup gardens together.",
        "Some ideas for doing this include:\nUse a tiered cake stand.",
        "Place one teacup garden on each tier of the cake stand.",
        "Decorate the cake stand as preferred, such as with dried flowers and moss.",
        "Place a row of teacup gardens together, such as along a shelf or on a table.",
        "Either keep to the same pattern of teacup or vary the teacup patterns but ensure they complement each other well.",
        "If the teacup is on its own attached saucer, include it on a coffee table or other display table atop a strong, strategically placed pile of books you're purposefully displaying.",
        "This can help to suggest the \"eclectic country cottage\" look.",
        "If placing on the patio, display on planter shelves or some other shelf place.",
        "As this is delicate, it should be somewhere safe from being bumped or trodden on.",
        "Add one or two teacup gardens to your fairy garden, if you have one.",
        "The fairies will love it."
