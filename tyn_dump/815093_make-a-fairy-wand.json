Depending on how much glue you used, this can take anywhere between a few hours to a whole day. Making a Fancy Fairy Wand Get a wooden craft dowel and cut it down, if necessary. You want the dowel to be between 12 and 18 inches long. Paint the dowel and let the paint dry. You can use acrylic paint or spray paint. It might be a good idea to stick the end of the dowel into a lump of clay and paint the top half first. Once the paint dries, flip the dowel over, and paint the bottom half. You can use any color you want, but great fairy colors include: silver, gold, pearly white, and pastel colors. Wrap some thin ribbon around the dowel. Place a drop of hot glue onto the top of the dowel. Press the end of your ribbon into the glue. Wrap the ribbon around the dowel. Leave spaces between the ribbon so that you can see the painted dowel underneath. It should look like a candy cane. Secure the other end of the ribbon to the bottom of the dowel with more hot glue. Glue a small rhinestone or beads to the bottom of the dowel. Place a drop of hot glue onto the bottom of the dowel. Press a small rhinestone or bead into the glue. The rhinestone or bead should not be wider than the base of the dowel. Find something to use as a topper. You can use anything you want as a topper for your wand, just make sure that it is not too large and not too heavy. You also don't want to use anything made from glass, just in case you drop it. Find a flat, wooden shape, such as a star. Find a small, round Christmas ornament and pull the metal cap off. The dowel needs to fit into the neck of the ornament. Make a topper out of air-dry clay. Be sure to poke a hole into the bottom of it using your dowel. For a creepy fairy, use a giant fake spider. For a snow fairy, use a snowflake ornament. Decorate the topper and let it dry. You can paint the topper or draw designs on it using glitter glue. You can also glue rhinestones onto it. Consider adding some very thin ribbon strands to the top of your wand. This can make it even more twirly. You can use regular satin ribbon or curling ribbon (like the type you'd use on a balloon). Cut five to seven pieces of ribbon that are a little bit shorter than your dowel and glue them to the top of your dowel. Glue the topper onto the top of the wand. 3-D items, such as figurines and ornaments, will be able to sit right on the tip. Flat items may have to be glued to the side of your dowel. Add final touches with glitter glue and rhinestones. You can glue some rhinestones along the sides of the dowel. You can also draw a thin ring of glitter glue around the bottom and top of your dowel to hide any seams and glue. Let the wand dry before playing with it. Hot glue dries quickly, but glitter glue takes a lot longer to dry. Wait a few hours to a whole day. Making Other Types of Fairy Wands Make a natural fairy wand. Find a stick that is between 12 and 18 inches long, and about as thick as your finger. Use sandpaper to smooth away any rough spots, especially on the top and bottom of the stick. Decorate your stick with silk flowers, fake leaves, glitter, and ribbon. You can add a large fake flower or butterfly to the top of your wand. Make an embossed fairy wand. Find a wooden dowel that is between 12 and 18 inches long. Draw squiggles and vines over the dowel using hot glue. You can also glue on some beads or jewels onto the dowel as well.
