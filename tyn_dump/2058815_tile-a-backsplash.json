The size of the area will determine the number of tiles you\u2019ll need to buy, as well as the space you\u2019ll need to prepare, so keep this information noted down when purchasing your equipment. Your backsplash should start slightly above the countertop in your kitchen. The top could either meet with the underside of your kitchen cabinets or could stop at any chosen place up the wall. If you don\u2019t know where you want your backsplash to end, wait until you know the size of the tiles you want to use. Make your backsplash a certain number of tiles high, rather than a predetermined height. Measure the height and width of the backsplash and keep these noted down.

Find a wall tile which matches the desired look for your kitchen, and purchase enough to cover the chosen area. Talk to the tile salesperson or someone at your local hardware store to work out how many tiles you'll need. Divide the area of your backsplash by the area of a single tile or tile sheet to get a rough idea of how many tiles you'll need. If you\u2019ll need to cut the tiles to fit into corners or underneath cabinets, it may help to purchase more tiles than you need to make up for tiles that break while cutting. Wall tiles tend to be thinner and more lightweight than flooring tiles. Make sure you choose the right type of tile for your project. Slate tiles have a tendency to crumble when they are cut, so may be more difficult to work with if you\u2019ve not used them before. Ceramic tiles, or other types of mosaic tiles, will be easier to work with and cut."

Mastic is a thin adhesive used for adhering tiles to a wall. It should be available at your local hardware store or online. Use a firm pressure when applying the mastic, so that the trowel is pressed against the wall. You should be able to just see the wall between the thicker lines of mastic. Mastic will begin to form a skin after around 10 minutes, which will stop the tiles from adhering to it. Apply mastic in sections that are small enough for you to tile before it hardens.

        "If your tiles do not have built-in spacers, use external tile spacers or wedges to leave a gap between your countertop and the first tile.",
        "If the tile slides around too much, it may be a sign that you\u2019ve used too much mastic.",
        "Remove the tile, scrape away the mastic, and try again with a thinner layer.",
        "Continue tiling the surface, working outwards from the first tile.",
        "With the first tile in place, begin positioning and pressing tiles into place.",
        "Work outwards from the first tile, alternating sides as you go to keep the first tile centered and balanced.",
        "Repeat this process, moving up the wall and applying mastic and tiles as you need them until the backsplash is tiled.",
        "Once you\u2019ve applied the first few tiles, take a step back and evaluate the way it looks.",
        "Straighten up any crooked tiles, or adjust any that aren\u2019t quite sitting in the right place.",
        "You\u2019ll only have a few minutes to do so before the mastic hardens, so work quickly.",
        "Use a grout float or another flat surfaced tool to press the tiles into place and make sure they are all level.",
        "Use a score-and-snap tile cutter to trim the tiles for corners.",
        "If your tiles don\u2019t fit perfectly into the space you\u2019re tiling, you\u2019ll need to trim some tiles around the edges.",
        "Hold your tile in place and mark the point you\u2019ll need to cut.",
        "Firmly score the tile along that point with a score-and-snap cutter, before bending it to snap it to the right size.",
        "It may help to sand down the side of the tile you have cut slightly, to remove any sharp edges before you put it into place.",
        "Put the cut side away from the tiles you have already placed so that the pattern of the edges remains the same across the entire backsplash.",
        "Leave the tiles to set overnight.",
        "While the mastic will begin to harden after roughly 10 minutes, it will take much longer for it to set up entirely.",
        "Leave your tiles overnight, or ideally for a full 24 hours, to allow the mastic to harden and keep your tiles in place.",
        "Your tiles won\u2019t be protected during this time.",
        "If your backsplash covers the area above your stove, you may need to avoid using it until the tiles have set into place.",
        "Finishing the Backsplash Smear tiling grout diagonally over the tiles.",
        "Use a grout float to scoop up some tile grout and begin smearing it over the tiles.",
        "Move the float diagonally, so as to push the grout into all of the spaces between your tiles.",
        "Work across the entire backsplash until all of the gaps between tiles are filled with grout.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about grout that covers or muddies the look of your tiles.",
        "Grout on the tiles will easily wash away, where the grout between should set in place.",
        "Grout should be available from your local hardware store, either premixed or as a powder.",
        "Follow the instructions on the powdered grout to hydrate it, generally by pouring it into a clean bucket and adding water until it reaches the consistency of mashed potatoes or peanut butter.",
        "Grout floats are tools designed specifically for spreading grout and should be available from your local hardware store.",
        "Wipe away the excess grout after 10 minutes.",
        "Once you\u2019ve applied grout all over the backsplash, allow it to dry for 10 minutes in order to begin solidifying.",
        "Slightly dampen a sponge and wring out as much water as you can.",
        "Working in diagonal strokes, wipe away the grout sitting on the face of the tiles.",
        "Clean the sponge regularly as you go to prevent grout from spreading over the tiles.",
        "Try and avoid pulling the grout out of the space between tiles as you work.",
        "You only need to wipe away the grout from the face of your tiles before it completely solidifies.",
        "Let the grout dry for a further 45 minutes.",
        "As with the mastic, the grout will need more time to set up and solidify completely.",
        "Leave it for 45 minutes to an hour to completely set up, avoiding touching the tiles or grout while it dries.",
        "If you notice any clumps of grout that have built up in the corners or along the edges of your backsplash, remove them at this point.",
        "If they don\u2019t wipe away with a sponge, use a utility knife to scrape them up and discard of them.",
        "Line the edges of your backsplash with caulk.",
        "Caulk is a sealant that will help stop water or moisture from getting behind your tiles and damaging the mastic.",
        "Use a caulk gun or caulk pen to trace around all edges of your backsplash, sealing the tiles completely.",
        "Run a wet finger over the caulk to smooth it, before leaving it to dry.",
        "Use a caulk that matches with the color of the grout to prevent it from standing out.",
        "Give the tiles plenty of time dry, ideally overnight.",
        "Once your tiling is finished and sealed, leave it for a further 24 hours to ensure that the mastic, grout, and caulk, are all given plenty of time to dry before you interact with them.",
        "This will ensure that your tiling sets and that it will last for years to come."
