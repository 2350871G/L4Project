You can also extend the cut a little bit below the armhole, but do not extend it to the front or back, or it will be too big. Don't worry if the sweater starts to unravel a little. Measure around the arm holes. Add both measurements together, plus 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) for the seam allowances. You will be using this measurement to cut the ribbing for the arms.

Tuck each ring into each armhole until the raw edges align with the center crease. Fold the top edge down of each ring over the raw edge of the armholes, sandwiching them inside.

Adding a V-Neck Collar (Optional) Draw a V-neck down the front of your sweater. You can eyeball it, if you'd like. If you want to be more precise, you can tuck the sweater inside an existing sweater vest, and use the existing vet's neckline as a guide. Put the sweater on and make sure that you are happy with the look. Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen for this. Cut the V-neck. If your sweater has a ribbed collar, cut the ribbing off first, then cut the V-neck. This will help reduce bulk.

Make sure that the notches are aligned. Cut one side first, then use it as a guide to cut the other. Sew the notches together. Fold the strip in half widthwise, with the right sides together.
