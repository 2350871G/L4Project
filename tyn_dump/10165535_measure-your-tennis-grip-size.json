        "In this case, you should still measure your grip.",
        "Unless your measurement is very close to the next racket size up, the next racket size down may be better for you since you can make the grip a little larger.",
        "For example, if your grip size is 4 \u204416 in (113 mm), a 4 \u20448 in (110 mm) racket may be your best fit.",
        "Add an overgrip to slightly increase your racket\u2019s grip size.",
        "An overgrip is a tape-like wrapping you fit over your racket handle.",
        "It adds about \u204416 in (1.6 mm) to the handle\u2019s size.",
        "In addition, it also makes the handle softer, stickier, and more sweat-absorbent.",
        "You can get overgrips wherever tennis supplies are sold.",
        "They come in a variety of patterns, so you can personalize your racket this way.",
        "An overgrip may need to be replaced on occasion to maintain your grip size.",
        "Use a heat shrink sleeve to add extra grip to your racket.",
        "A heat shrink sleeve is a more permanent grip solution than an overgrip.",
        "You slide the fabric over your racket handle, then heat it with a heat gun or another heat source until it shrinks.",
        "It adds about \u20448 in (3.2 mm) to your racket\u2019s handle size.",
        "When you are finished using it, you cut it off of your racket.",
        "Heat shrink sleeves can be tricky to install and remove, so you may want to use overgrips at first until you know your grip size."
