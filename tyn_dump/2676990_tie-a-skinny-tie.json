You can button the tie all the way to the top if you want but keep the end knot loose. Locate the seam on the front of the narrow end of the tie. There should be a seam located on narrow end of the tie, close to its highest point. You should cross the tie around this point. Cross the tie at the seam. Move the wide end over the narrow end so they cross on the seam. Use the seam as a guiding point for where to cross the tie. You can cross a bit higher or a bit lower than the seam. Don't go too high or low! Wrap the wide end around the narrow end. Pull the wide end behind the narrow end. Then, bring the wide end around to the left. Push the wide end through the loop. Bring the wide end up. Now, push it through the loop around your neck. Pull the wide end through the knot. Use your index finger to keep a loose hold on the front of the knot and the narrow end.
