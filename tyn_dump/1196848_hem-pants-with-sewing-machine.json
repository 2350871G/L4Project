To perfect a clean line to guide your scissors, use a ruler. Make sure you position the ruler's edge to the mark. Cutting the Pants Get your scissors out. If you don't have sewing scissors, consider buying a pair. You can also use your regular everyday scissors, but it is easier to use a sharp pair. Start at the bottom. Cut the line closest to the bottom first. Be patient and avoid cutting fast. This will create messy zig-zags instead of a neat edge.

Cut the following lines above your initial cut until you reach the line under the top line. Focus on one leg at a time. Don't cut the topmost line or crease. This line marks where your pants will be hemmed. Cut loose threads. Use your scissors to cut any loose threads that got left behind. You might need to repeat this step near the end or after you wash the pants. Sewing the Hem Fold the pants inside out. Fold the pants so that the outside of the pants are facing out. You should be able to see the inner seam. This will make it easier to sew the hem. You could simply fold the legs inside out without doing this to the entire pants. Fold the hem. Fold up the hem from the edge up to the top line. Make sure your top line or crease is on the edge of the fold. This edge will be the hem. Make sure the size looks good before you finalize the job. Iron the fold. Take your pants onto an ironing board. Wait till the iron is fully heated. Then iron the fold down. This will create a professional fold and ensure that you don't have any uneven lines. Load your sewing machine. Load the bobbin with the thread of your choice. You can use matching thread to blend in, or a contrasting color, like the gold thread used on most denim jeans. Set your machine.
