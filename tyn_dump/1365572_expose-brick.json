Taking a chisel to a plaster wall can generate a considerable amount of dust and debris. By taking a few moments to put down a protective buffer, you stand to save yourself a lot of time and energy that you might otherwise spend deep-cleaning later on. It may also be a good idea to seal off air vents and doorways close to your work area to limit the amount of dust that makes its way into other parts of your home.Tip: Keep your windows uncovered and open wide to provide some much-needed ventilation. If you like, you can even place a box fan on the window sill to suck out excess dust lingering in the air."
