An insertion loss test helps you identify whether the computer, network, or power source is the root of your connectivity problem. It also assesses how well a cable can handle a signal, if any information is lost as it travels through the cable, and whether your cable is operating efficiently and safely or not.Warning: You cannot perform this test without special protective eyewear designed specifically for fiber optics. Fiber optic cables rely on high-power light signals to send information, and you could be blinded or injured if you don\u2019t protect your eyes. You usually won\u2019t even see any light while testing, but there are harmful UV rays that are bad for your eyes. Get a pair of safety glasses from a fiber optic manufacturer online. They typically cost $100-200. An insertion loss test is also known as an attenuation or jumper test. You cannot perform an insertion loss test on more than 1 cable at a time."

This kit includes an optical source, which fires a signal into the cable, and an optical meter, which reads the signal at the other end. The difference between the power output of the source and the reading on the meter will tell you how much information you\u2019re losing in the cable. The optical source is also known as a light source or power source. An insertion lost testing kit costs $500-3000, depending on how much functionality you want in your testing kit. Test kits typically come with 2 jumper cables, which you need to complete the test. If they don\u2019t, purchase 2 fiber optic jumper cables separately. You also need 2 fiber optic patch panels. A patch panel is basically an array of different ports for patching 2 cables together without splicing them (like a breadboard). A single patch panel costs $10-250, depending on how many ports you need. For an insertion loss test, you only need 2 ports on each panel."

        "Assess the cable\u2019s dBm to determine how strong the cable is.",
        "In terms of the cable\u2019s power, a dBm between 0 and -15 is generally okay, but the power level is heavily dependent on what the cable is for.",
        "Power loss is a much bigger issue if the cable is hooked up to a surgical instrument, but it\u2019s not a big deal if you\u2019re simply connecting a modem to a router.",
        "This number can be negative or positive, so pay attention to the symbol at the front of the number  \nThis number can be positive since anything over 1 milliwatt is considered a positive charge.",
        "The cable isn\u2019t technically adding power.",
        "If the readings are in an acceptable range and you\u2019re still experiencing problems with the cable, the issues are likely not the cable itself."
