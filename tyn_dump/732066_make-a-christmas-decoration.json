        "The wider your ribbon pieces are, the fewer you will need.",
        "Something that is around 1 to 1 \u20442 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) wide would work great.",

        "Wrap and tie the string around the sticks instead of piercing them with a needle.",
        "Press whole, dried cloves into an orange for a rustic touch.",
        "You can stick the cloves randomly, or you can create patterns, like stripes.",
        "Keep the cloves \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) apart for a nice, full look.",
        "For a fancier orange, wrap some thin red or gold ribbon around the orange first.",

        "Coat mason jars with glue and Epsom salts to make snow lanterns.",
        "Fill a tray with Epsom salt and set it aside.",
        "Mix 3 parts white school glue with 1 part water.",
        "Brush the solution onto a mason jar, then roll the mason jar across the Epsom salt in the tray, then set it aide to dry.",
        "Add some iridescent glitter to the salt to make the lantern really sparkle.",
        "Once the lantern has dried, place a tea light into it.",
        "You can use this technique on other glass candle holders as well."
