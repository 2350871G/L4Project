            "description": "It helps your child if the recipe is printed out, even if you know it by heart. Your child will be able to read the recipe and comprehend what it means. If needed, describe what you child needs to do if they are having trouble understanding the recipe. You could also rewrite the recipe yourself and make it into an easier understanding for your child."

Girls with long hair may need their hair tied, may need to wear a net, or may need to wear a chef\u2019s hat to avoid hair in the cookies. Prevent your child from wearing expensive new clothes or clothes with long sleeves. Letting your child wear an apron or/and a chef\u2019s hat makes them feel proud and feel like a \u2018baker\u2019. Consider this while you choose an outfit before baking."

But if you have a quick clean up mode, it\u2019s not so bad.
