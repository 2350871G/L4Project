        "Light-colored pots reflect sunlight and tend to absorb less heat than dark-colored pots.",
        "Make sure the bottom of the pot has plenty of drainage holes.",
        "This allows any excess water to drain out of the pot.",
        "If the container that you\u2019re using is plastic, use an electric drill or a hammer and nail to make holes in the underside of the pot.",
        "If you\u2019re planning to keep your pot indoors, be sure to place a saucer or other kind of water collection dish underneath your pot to stop any draining water from seeping out onto your floor.",
        "Fill the pot until the soil line is about 2 in (5.1 cm) from the pot\u2019s rim.",
        "Avoid filling the pot all the way to the top, because this can make it easier to damage the crowns of the lettuce when you harvest them.",
        "Gently press the soil down into the pot so it compacts.",
        "Picking a Lettuce Variety Choose Romaine lettuce if you have a smaller container.",
        "Romaine is a great lettuce for smaller pots because it needs less room to grow.",
        "It grows outward from a tight center, and can survive in mild heat.",
        "Romaine typically takes about 75-80 days to mature.",
        "There are different varieties of Romaine lettuce to choose from, but Parris Island, or Cos, is the most popular.",
        "Romaine lettuce also tends to do pretty well indoors.",
        "Plant iceberg lettuce if you have a lot of time to let your lettuce grow.",
        "Iceberg lettuce is the most recognizable form of crisphead lettuce.",
        "It has less nutrients than other varieties, a high water content, and a pretty flat taste.",
        "It takes a little longer to grow \u2014 about 80 to 95 days, and generally needs more space to mature into large heads.",
        "Iceberg lettuce is very much a cool-weather crop, so plant it as early in the spring as possible.",
        "Opt for loose-leaf lettuce if you live in a warmer climate.",
        "Loose-leaf lettuces, such as Oakleaf and Deer Tongue, are the most successful in hot climates.",
        "Note that they do tend to have a stronger taste than other varieties.",
        "They take about 70 to 85 days to grow.",
        "Loose-leaf lettuce has the most variation in color and taste, so do some research on which types of loose-leaf you want to try.",
        "Grow butterhead lettuce if you want a sweeter taste.",
        "Butterhead lettuce is known for its sweet, \u201cbuttery\u201d taste and velvety leaf texture.",
        "It takes around 45 to 55 days to grow, but can really be harvested at any point in its development.",
        "Butterhead is also much higher in nutrition than other lettuce varieties.",
        "Planting Your Lettuce Plant lettuce when the weather is cooler.",
        "Lettuce grows best in air temperatures ranging from 50 to 77 \u00b0F (10 to 25 \u00b0C), with the ideal soil temperature being 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C).",
        "The best times to plant lettuce tend to be early spring and early fall, when the weather is more temperate.",
        "Lettuce that sprouts in hot conditions usually produces a plant hormone that stops the germination of lettuce, leading the plants to quickly die out.",
        "If you are planning on planting your lettuce during the warmer parts of the year, soak the seeds or the root systems of your seedlings in cool water for at least 16 hours to increase the likelihood of germination.",
        "Sow lettuce seeds directly into your pot.",
        "Use your finger to poke holes in the soil that are about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) deep.",
        "Then, place 2-3 seeds in each hole.",
        "Once you\u2019ve filled all the holes, sprinkle another layer of potting soil \u2014 about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick \u2014 over the top of the holes.",
        "Putting 2-3 seeds in each hole may seem like a lot, but keep in mind that not all of the seeds will germinate.",
        "Plant lettuce seedling transplants by loosening the roots.",
        "Nurseries often sell lettuce seedlings in individual plastic cells that you can transfer to your prepared pot.",
        "Simply press on the sides of the cell to loosen the seedling\u2019s roots and gently pull it out.",
        "Then, gently pull the bottom parts of the root apart to loosen it.",
        "Finally, bury the plant\u2019s root system in the soil and gently pad the soil in around the base of the plant.",
        "Soaking your lettuce transplants in cold water overnight before potting them can increase the chances of their survival.",
        "Space the lettuce plants 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) apart.",
        "Leaving 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) between each plant gives the lettuce enough room to develop into beautiful heads.",
        "However, spacing doesn\u2019t have to be exact with lettuce, because you will be harvesting the plants fairly often.",
        "Caring for Your Lettuce Give your lettuce at least 4 hours of direct sun exposure.",
        "Avoid leaving your lettuce in the sun for longer than 7 hours.",
        "Strong, hot sun exposure \u2014 particularly in the warmer afternoons \u2014 can be damaging to lettuce, so move your lettuce to shade in the afternoon.",
        "The ability to simply move your lettuce pot to control sun exposure is one of the great benefits of container gardening.",
        "Water your lettuce so the soil stays moist.",
        "Lettuce is made up of about 95% water, so it needs a lot of water to stay crisp and firm.",
        "Try to keep the soil slightly moist at all times, which can mean watering deeply 1-2 times a week during periods without regular rainfall.",
        "Keeping your lettuce well-watered can often help to keep aphids at bay.",
        "Avoid soaking the lettuce and over-watering it.",
        "This can result in root rot, stunted growth, and disease.",
        "Try to water your lettuce in the early morning or late afternoon.",
        "This prevents the mid-day sun from evaporating the water before it really soaks into the soil.",
        "Fertilize every 2 weeks once your lettuce is 8 weeks old.",
        "If you want to give your lettuce a growth boost once it is at least 8 weeks old, apply liquid or granular balanced fertilizer to the plants.",
        "This can be helpful if you have planted a lot of lettuce very close together, because those plants are going to require a lot of nutrients.",
        "When choosing a fertilizer, look for one that is well-balanced with equal parts nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium.",
        "These are sometimes marked as 10-10-10 or 5-5-5 mixtures.",
        "Harvesting Your Lettuce Harvest your lettuce in the morning.",
        "Lettuce is at its most crisp in the early morning.",
        "This is because exposure to sunlight can wilt and damage the tender leaves.",
        "Cut away the outer leaves, leaving the plant\u2019s base to re-grow.",
        "When the lettuce leaves are 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) tall, use scissors or a knife to slice away the outermost, most mature leaves from the base of the plant, which is typically called the crown.",
        "Leave the small, immature leaves at the heart of the plant to continue growing, and return to re-harvest later in the week.",
        "This method is often called the cut-and-come-again method.",
        "You can harvest lettuce by pulling the whole head out, but using this method will shorten the life and decrease the production of your plant.",
        "Avoid damaging the crown of the plant while you harvest.",
        "This can kill the plant.",
        "For romaine lettuce, see How to Harvest Romaine Lettuce.",
        "Store lettuce in your fridge for up to a week.",
        "To maximize freshness, soak your lettuce leaves in an ice bath for 5 minutes immediately after harvesting.",
        "Then, keep your lettuce wrapped in a damp paper towel or in a plastic bag in the fridge to keep it fresh for as long as possible."
