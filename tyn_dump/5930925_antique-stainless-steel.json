The water in the coffee grounds should quickly cool off the metal. Theoretically, the steel should be safe to touch once you remove it from the grounds, but you should still proceed with caution.

        "You need to remove some of the paint, but you shouldn't wipe all of it away.",
        "Much of the paint should still remain after you complete this step.",
        "As you dab away at the paint, you should notice some spots where the paint smears and others where the paint develops a splattered appearance.",
        "Both effects are what you need to retain.",
        "Alternate as needed.",
        "Work back and forth between the previous two steps.",
        "Apply paint with your paintbrush, then dab some of the paint away with your wet sponge.",
        "As the sponge gets loaded with paint, you may need to rinse it with clean water.",
        "After rinsing the sponge, gently wring it out before returning to the steel piece.",
        "You should work with a damp sponge, not one that is dripping wet.",
        "Continue alternating between painting and sponging until you create a naturally worn appearance.",
        "Let dry.",
        "Set the stainless steel piece aside and allow it to dry completely before handling it further.",
        "Examine the dry piece.",
        "Most of the natural metal should show through beneath the coat of paint.",
        "Determine whether or not you are satisfied with these results.",
        "Carefully consider additional coats of paint.",
        "If desired, you could try adding a coat of copper metallic paint on top of the gunmetal paint.",
        "Apply this second coat with the same painting and sponging technique used for the first.",
        "This second coat is only optional.",
        "Understand that it will cover more of the natural metal, and if you don't like the results, you will need to clean off the paint and start from the beginning.",
        "It will be impossible to salvage the first layer you applied.",
        "Avoid adding any coat beyond the second.",
        "Adding too many layers may make it more obvious that the piece has been painted instead of naturally aged.",
        "Once you achieve the desired appearance, the project is complete.",
        "Note that the antique effect will last for a long time unless the paint is washed away."
