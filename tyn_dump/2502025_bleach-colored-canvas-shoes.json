        "The bottle should have a nozzle with two to three settings: spray, mist, and off.",
        "Close the spray bottle and shake it.",
        "This will mix up the bleach and water inside.",
        "Start spraying your shoes.",
        "Use the \"spray\" setting to squirt a few splatters onto your sneakers.",

        "Here's a list of what you will need:\nCanvas sneakers\nBowl\nBleach\nSmall, cheap, stiff-bristled paintbrush\nBleach pen (optional) Plan out your design.",
        "Once you start drawing on your shoes, it will be impossible to erase the bleach.",
        "Get out a piece of paper and a pen or pencil, and sketch out your design.",

        "Pour some bleach into a bowl and get out a cheap, thin paint brush.",
        "Make sure that the bristles are stiff and made of plastic.",
        "If the bristles are too soft, they won't hold the bleach.",

        "Consider testing the bleach pen out on some scrap fabric first.",
        "Start drawing your design onto your shoes.",

        "It will take about an hour or so.",

        "Consider rinsing the shoes once you are happy with the lightness.",
        "This will stop the bleach from acting, and prevent it from deteriorating the fabric."
