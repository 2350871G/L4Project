        "Make sure the entire bag is under the water for the full 10-15 minutes.",
        "If necessary, place a heavier item on top of the bag to keep it submerged (such as a glass bowl, bottle of water, etc.).",
        "Soaking the bag will help lift and loosen stains that may have formed inside the bag without completely soaking through all the fabric of the bag.",
        "Scrub stubborn stains with an old toothbrush to remove them.",
        "Once you\u2019ve removed your bag from the water, inspect both the outside and inside of the bag looking for stains that may have not been completely removed.",
        "Use an old toothbrush to scrub in a circular motion any stubborn stains.",
        "If you don\u2019t have an old toothbrush available, use a clean cloth or rag to scrub the stains, also in a circular motion.",
        "Rinse your diaper bag with clean water to remove the soap.",
        "Hold your diaper bag under the tap of a large sink (such as a laundry tub) to rinse away all the soap.",
        "Make sure all the soap has been rinsed from both the inside and outside of the bag.",
        "Turn the bag inside out to rinse the inside of the bag.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a large enough sink, use the faucet and/or showerhead in your bathroom to rinse the diaper bag.",
        "Hang your diaper bag somewhere to air dry.",
        "Do not put your diaper bag in a dryer.",
        "Hang the bag on a clothesline, towel bag, or even a shower rod.",
        "You can also lie your bag flat on a towel to dry, just remember to turn it over a couple of times so every side dries out.",
        "While the bag is drying, you may want to re-shape the bag.",
        "Washing and rinsing the bag may have stretched or twisted it out of shape.",
        "Make sure your diaper bag is completely dry before using it again.",
        "Using the Washing Machine Read the manufacturer\u2019s care and cleaning instructions thoroughly.",
        "Not all diaper bags are designed to be cleaned in a washing machine, such as leather diaper bags or those with leather trim.",
        "If you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s best to avoid using the washer and just spot/hand clean the bag.",
        "Some diaper bags may have warranties that will be voided if you don\u2019t clean them properly.",
        "Remove partitions, straps, and handles from the diaper bag.",
        "If there are any items in or on the diaper bag which can be removed, take them off before putting the bag in the washing machine.",
        "Straps and handles may be damaged if they get caught on something while inside the washing machine.",
        "Removable parts may not be washed properly if left inside the bag.",
        "If you need to clean the removable handles, straps, or partitions from the bag, do so by hand, not in the washing machine.",
        "The removable partitions may have cardboard as their interior (to keep them stiff), which may be ruined if you submerge them in water.",
        "Put the diaper bag inside a mesh bag or pillowcase.",
        "Instead of placing your diaper bag directly into the washing machine, put it inside a large mesh bag or even a pillowcase first.",
        "The mesh bag or pillowcase will protect the bag from being damaged inside the washing machine and will help prevent the diaper bag from being stretched out of shape.",
        "This step is particularly important if you have a washing machine with an agitator.",
        "The agitator can damage the bag, or straps/handles may get stuck on the agitator during the spin cycle.",
        "Use the gentle cycle with warm water and a mild detergent.",
        "Always use the gentle or delicate cycle on your washing machine for cleaning a diaper bag.",
        "Use a warm water setting (or a cold water setting if you\u2019re concerned about colours running).",
        "Only use gentle or mild laundry detergent.",
        "Avoid using bleach on any bags that aren\u2019t entirely white.",
        "Wash the bag in a load with other delicate items of similar colours.",
        "Use whatever mild detergent you already have for cleaning your baby\u2019s clothing.",
        "Remove the bag from the washing machine and allow it to air dry.",
        "Take the diaper bag out of the mesh bag or pillowcase.",
        "Put your diaper bag somewhere where it can air dry.",
        "Either hang the bag to dry, lay it on a towel, or put it on top of a drying rack.",
        "You can also put your diaper bag outside in the sun if you\u2019d like.",
        "The mesh laundry bag or pillowcase you used can be put into the dryer with another load or dried using the same methods as the diaper bag."
