The water supply valve will either be located behind the toilet or in the crawl space or basement space directly beneath the toilet. Remove the lid of the toilet tank and flush the toilet, holding down the handle so that as much water as possible drains from the tank and the bowl.  Use a plastic cup to scoop out any water that is left in the bowl and then dry up the last drops of moisture with a dry sponge.  Disconnect the water supply tube by turning the compression nut on the water supply valve in a counterclockwise direction with a wrench or a pair of pliers.  Pry the caps from the washers at the base of the toilet using a flat head screwdriver.  Remove the nuts from the bolts at the toilet base using a wrench. Remove any washer as well. If the bolt spins as you turn the nut, then hold the bolt with a pair of pliers using your non-dominant hand.
