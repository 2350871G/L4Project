If you add too little, it increases the amount of time for it to cure, and if you don't add enough it will never cure. If you add 1 line of hardener across the top of the dollop of Bondo, it takes about 15 minutes to dry after applying. Add 2 lines and it takes about 5 minutes to dry. Experiment to get the right Bondo mixture."
