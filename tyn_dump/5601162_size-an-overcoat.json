If you\u2019re unsure, visit a professional tailor or buy a fabric measuring tape and find out for yourself. In most cases, your optimal overcoat size will correspond exactly with your suit size, as modern overcoats are sized to fit over a suit jacket or sport coat. A size 42 overcoat will not be exactly 42 inches (106.7 cm) around the chest. The sizing number is listed to match your suit size, but will actually be a couple of inches bigger to accommodate the suit underneath. If you usually wear a 42S size in a suit, consider having your overcoat sized 42R or even 42L to get the right fit. In general, an overcoat shoulder fits slightly long and loose because its primary purpose is to envelop the body and cover the clothing beneath."

Let your arms rest at your sides while measuring so that your chest will be fully expanded and in the most natural position. This measurement will tell you how large your overcoat needs to be in the chest. It\u2019s usually a good idea to buy one size larger based on chest measurements so that you\u2019ll have ample room to move comfortably in your coat. If your measurement is between sizes, round up.

This will ensure that the sleeve will be long enough not to pull too high when you bend your arms. Overcoat sleeves need to be a very particular length, so finding out the length of your arm span will help you end up with a coat that fits perfectly. For overcoats bought off the rack, a chest measurement will probably be all you need. However, if you\u2019re having an overcoat made or altered specifically for your figure, you\u2019ll need to get more detailed measurements of your upper body. Overcoat sleeves should be long enough to cover the sleeve of your sportcoat and the cuff of your shirt when worn."

Decide which style you prefer and how your height will play a factor in sizing the coat.

Put the coat on and move around a little, observing how movement causes the coat to tense and draw up on your body. An overcoat should fit comfortably and loosely over a suit, so if it feels snug in any area above the waist, consider moving up a size. Discuss alterations with a tailor or seamstress, even if you're buying a coat off the rack. An overcoat that is too big can be altered after the fact to better fit your physique. Little can be done to modify a coat that is too small. Look for areas with excessive creasing, tension or bunching. This usually signifies an improper fit."
