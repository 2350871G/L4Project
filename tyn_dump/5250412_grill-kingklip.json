                    "description": "No matter what type of grill you use, it should be preheated to as hot a temperature as you can preheat it to. Heating the grill to high heat will allow you to immediately sear the flesh of the kingklip. This makes it harder for the fish to stick to the grate. If using a gas or electric grill, turn all of the burners on high and let them heat up for several minutes. If using a charcoal grill, pour a large, even pile of coals into the grill and light them on fire. When the flames die down and no longer flick above the grill grate, the coals should be ready."

                    "description": "When cooking kingklip directly on top of the grill, it is vital that you start with a clean grate to prevent the flesh from sticking. Ideally, the grill grate should be clean before you start cooking. If the grate is not clean, however, cover the grill for five minutes while the fire is its hottest. Open the grill and use a flame-resistant grill brush to brush away any residue on the top of the grate."

Use an oven mitt or glove to protect your hands from the heat as you oil the grate. You could also hold the cloth with tongs as you work with it. Nonstick cooking spray can be applied, as well, but it is recommended that you apply spray products to the grill grate before you light any fire."

When direct grilling kingklip, you may have more success if you cook a large fillet instead of cooking individually portioned cuts of fillet. Melted margarine can be used instead of olive oil, if desired."

When using a charcoal grill, carefully slide the fish over to an area of the grill receiving less direct heat. Kingklip, like most types of fish, can quickly overcook when grilled over high heat. For that reason, it is best to do most of the cooking over medium heat."
