Apply the brakes evenly in a controlled manner to reduce your speed. Before you come to a complete stop, release the brakes. Repeat the procedure about 20 times.Then, work up to a faster speed and apply the brakes until you reach a walking speed. Release the brakes and repeat the process 10 times to bed-in your breaks and ensure they will operate consistently. Be sure to remain seated at all times and avoid locking up the wheels at any point! Let the brakes cool completely before you ride your bike again. If you are not familiar with the operation and power of the bike and brakes, have a certified bike mechanic perform this procedure for you, as you must perform some heavy braking. This could lead to injury if you are not an experienced rider that is familiar with the bike at hand."
