They usually have a comfortable loop at the end for your hand, which allows you to keep a firm grip on the leash to keep control over your dog. Most standard leashes are made of nylon, but you can also buy ones made out of chain, leather, and sometimes cotton. Nylon leashes are the cheapest, but leather and chain leashes are more durable. Chain leashes are the best material to go with for dogs that tend to chew through other leash materials. Cotton leashes are pretty rare to find, but they\u2019re the best leashes to use for swimming dogs."

It allows dogs to wander far away from their owners but also gives the owner the power to retract the leash to bring the dog back if they wander too far. This leash is better for dogs who are already pretty well-trained, but still need to be reined in from time to time. Retractable leashes almost always have a brake button on the handle, which enables the owner to stop the leash from extending any further. This is very useful for situations when your dog begins to run away from you on the leash. Note that retractable leashes are very controversial and many experts advise against using them. This is mainly due to the fact that this type of leash allows dogs to bolt away from their owners into possibly dangerous situations, such as into busy traffic. Retractable leashes teach the dog to pull. Don\u2019t use a retractable leash in an area where you need full control of your dog, such as at the vet."

Make this sound to your dog, then give it a treat when it looks at you and comes to you. Do this repeatedly when during leash time to build the association in your dog\u2019s mind between that cue and getting treats. To make it easier, do this training in a quiet, distraction-free area. This will make it easier for your dog to keep its attention on you when you make the sound. You may have to begin by rewarding your dog just for looking at you when you make the sound.

        "Leash Training Your Dog Introduce your dog to wearing a collar and leash inside.",
        "If your dog has never worn a collar or leash before, start by letting it wear this combination in your home for short periods of time (e.g., 15 minutes).",
        "Play with your dog and give it treats during this time so that it comes to associate wearing the leash with having fun and getting rewarded.",
        "Make sure you get the right collar for your dog.",
        "Martingale collars are good collars for leash training.",
        "Once your dog is fully trained though, your best bet is to opt for a normal flat collar.",
        "Don\u2019t leave the leash attached to your dog for too long.",
        "It should associate wearing the leash with having fun, but it should also know that being on the leash is temporary.",
        "This will help make your dog easier to control later on.",
        "Use treats to teach your dog to respond to a cue from you.",
        "This cue should be something that you use (e.g., clicking your tongue, making a kiss sound with your lips, or simply saying \u201ccome here\u201d) that tells your dog to stop what it\u2019s doing and come to you.",
        "Make this sound to your dog, then give it a treat when it looks at you and comes to you.",
        "Do this repeatedly when during leash time to build the association in your dog\u2019s mind between that cue and getting treats.",
        "To make it easier, do this training in a quiet, distraction-free area.",
        "This will make it easier for your dog to keep its attention on you when you make the sound.",
        "You may have to begin by rewarding your dog just for looking at you when you make the sound.",
        "Eventually, once it associates the cue with getting a treat, your dog will also begin coming to you when you make the sound.",
        "During leash time, do this training exercise at least 3 separate times.",
        "The more times you can do it, the better.",
        "Train your dog to come towards you as you walk away from it.",
        "Once your dog has learned to respond to your cue, you then need to teach it to also pursue you while you\u2019re moving.",
        "Make the cue sound, then begin walking backward away from your dog while it comes to you.",
        "Be sure to maintain eye contact with your dog so it knows you\u2019re not ignoring it.",
        "Perform this training exercise repeatedly during leash time to make sure your dog fully associates following you with being rewarded.",
        "After you\u2019ve done this a few times, start training your dog to expect a reward while walking with you.",
        "Have your dog come to you, then continue walking as you give it a treat.",
        "Keep cuing the dog to come to you while continuing to walk until it starts walking along with you the whole time.",
        "Practice walking your dog on a leash inside before taking it outside.",
        "In a quiet, distraction-free room, walk your dog around the room just as you would walk it outside.",
        "Keep a steady walking pace and have the dog follow along with you.",
        "Reward your dog with a treat after every few steps.",
        "Once you\u2019ve done this type of indoor walk a few times, take your dog on a short, 5-minute walk outside to test its training in the outdoors.",
        "Use your cue sound to keep your dog under control when you\u2019re walking outside, especially if it looks like it\u2019s about to lunge at something distracting.",
        "Keep your first few outdoor walks short; you just want to get your dog used to the idea of walking outside at first.",
        "Training Your Dog to Not Pull on the Leash Start by teaching your dog to stay at your side on a leash in your yard.",
        "The best remedy for a dog pulling on the leash is to make it want to stay as close to you as possible when it\u2019s on the leash.",
        "To do this, put your dog on an 8 ft (2.4 m) training leash and walk it in a controlled outdoor environment like a backyard.",
        "Cue your dog to come to you and give it a treat for standing next to you.",
        "Then, walk a few steps back and cue your dog to follow.",
        "Give it another treat to reward it for coming to you.",
        "If your dog is having trouble doing this, take it inside and try again later when the dog is a bit hungrier.",
        "It will be much more motivated to earn those treats at that point!",
        "Train your dog to follow you when you walk away holding the leash.",
        "Walk away from your dog, then give it a treat as soon as it starts to follow and walk alongside you.",
        "Give it treats for every few steps that it continues to walk with you.",
        "Make several random or unpredictable turns to teach your dog to pay attention to your movements instead of other distractions.",
        "This will teach your dog that if it wants to continue being rewarded, it has to not only walk alongside you, but also focus its attention on you instead of other dogs, squirrels, or other distractions.",
        "Once your dog has done this a few times, start increasing the number of steps you take before you give it a treat.",
        "This will keep your dog motivated to follow you for longer distances in order to get rewarded.",
        "Give your dog \u201cfree time\u201d to stop and sniff things while it\u2019s on the leash.",
        "While you\u2019re walking around the yard with your dog, allow it to occasionally stop and sniff the things that it wants to.",
        "After about 10 seconds, cue your dog to follow you and start walking away.",
        "Then give your dog a treat when it comes to you.",
        "This will teach your dog that it can still occasionally sniff things, but that it can\u2019t do it all the time.",
        "This will keep your dog from becoming frustrated during its training.",
        "For best results, dictate when your dog should be able to sniff and when it should walk by stopping during the walk and saying \u201cgo sniff.\u201d Your dog won\u2019t understand the words, but it will understand the idea that now is a time to do what it wants instead of walking.",
        "Take your dog on a real walk test with a short leash to test its manners.",
        "Move the walk from your backyard (or whatever environment you\u2019ve been training your dog in) to a different walking path.",
        "Bring your treats with you and give your dog a treat as it walks with you about once a minute.",
        "Use a 6 ft (1.8 m) leash just in case your dog tries to start pulling so you can quickly get it under control.",
        "If your dog pulls during the walk, immediately stop and stand still until the dog comes back to you.",
        "Do not reinforce your dog\u2019s pulling behavior by walking in the direction it wants to go in."
