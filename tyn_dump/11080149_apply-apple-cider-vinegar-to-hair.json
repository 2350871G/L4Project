For example, if you are making a large batch of the rinse, try mixing 8 ounces (230 g) of apple cider vinegar for every 8 ounces (230 g) of water. If your skin is sensitive, try a more diluted mixture, such as 1 part apple cider vinegar to every 2 or 3 parts water. This will make the rinse less acidic and easier on your skin.

If you use a spray bottle, make sure that it is new and clean, as any residue from other products may be harmful to your hair.

Lavender, rosemary, lemongrass, and tea tree are all essential oils commonly found in hair products, and contain nutrients that may help make your hair healthier. Lavender, tea tree, and rosemary are particularly popular for stimulating healthy hair growth, while lemongrass may help with itchy scalp caused by dandruff. Be careful with hot oils, such as peppermint, though, as these may irritate your skin. If you want to add a hot oil like peppermint to your solution, stick to 1 to 2 drops until you know how the oil impacts your skin."
