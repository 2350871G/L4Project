                    "description": "Green onions, or scallions, are the green shoots that come up before an onion bulb begins to form. They are essentially immature onions. Look for a hearty scallion seed, such as the species A. Welsh onions, or simply choose your favorite white, red or yellow onion to grow. If you'd prefer not to start the green onions from seed, choose red, white or onion \"sets\" to plant. These look like bare-root mini bulbs that come bound with twine or rubber bands. You can pick up a few sets to use as scallions, and let the others mature into onion bulbs."

Till the dirt to a depth of 12 inches and work in compost, blood meal or another organic material to enrich the soil with nutrients. This will ensure that the green onions grow strong and healthy, and continue to produce shoots throughout the growing season. Be sure rocks, sticks and weeds are cleared away before you till and work the soil. You can till the soil using a garden rake if you're working with a small patch. For a bigger area, buy or rent a soil tiller to make the job easier. If you just want a few green onions, you can prepare a pot with a compost-rich potting soil instead of planting them in the ground."

If you have seeds, sow them thickly about 1/2 inch deep in rows spaced 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. If you have sets, plant them root-side down 2 inches apart and 1 inch deep, in rows 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Water the garden bed thoroughly. The onion seeds will germinate when the soil is anywhere between 65 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 to 30 degrees Celsius). It may take up to a month for onion seeds to germinate. If you live in a cold climate with a late spring, you can start the seeds indoors about eight weeks before the last frost. Plant the seeds in peat seed starter pots and keep them well-watered. Put them in a warm, sunny room to during the germination period.

        "Set the jar in a sunny window and wait for the magic to happen.",
        "Within a few days, you should see the roots starting to get longer.",
        "Tiny green shoots will emerge from the bulbs and begin growing upward.",
        "Keep the jar filled with enough water to cover the white part of the onions.",
        "Harvest the greens.",
        "Once they're 4 to 6 inches long, they're ready to harvest.",
        "Remove a green onion from the jar and chop off as much as you want - or use the whole thing.",
        "If you just need a handful of chopped scallion, you can return the bulb and roots to the jar to continue growing.",
        "You should be able to harvest the same onions two to three times before they stop growing.",
        "If you want to continue growing onions year round, then put some rocks and pebbles in the bottom of the jar.",
        "Then, place soil over the rocks and pebbles and plant the bulbs in the soil."
