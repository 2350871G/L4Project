Use a razor that is sharp enough to cut the hair without having to go over it again and again. Depending on how often you shave, you may need to replace your blade every month or so. Some people switch out blades after five uses, but determine what works best for you. Use a single-blade razor. This will actually be more effective in cutting the hair, so long as it\u2019s sharp. Remember to shave in the same direction that the hair is growing. Otherwise hairs could actually get stuck as they are growing back, thus causing ingrown hairs. While electric razors may be suitable for most parts of your body, refrain from using one on your pubic area."
