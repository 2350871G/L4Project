                    "description": "Use clear, running water to rinse the wound. Take a clean washcloth, wet it, and dip it in soap. Clean around the wound with the soapy washcloth, but keep soap out of the cut, as it can cause irritation. Pat the cut dry with a clean towel once you have cleaned it. If there is dirt or debris in the cut after you have rinsed it and washed around it, use tweezers to remove the debris. Dip the tweezers in rubbing alcohol to sanitize it before you use it on your cut. You do not need to use hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, iodine, or an iodine-based cleanser on the cut, as these products can be irritating to the damaged tissue. If debris still remains the cut, or is hard to remove, you should seek professional medical care at your nearest clinic or hospital."

You likely will not be able to stop the bleeding on your own. Apply pressure to an artery cut with a clean washcloth, towel, or sterile gauze and go to the emergency room. Do not attempt to apply a tourniquet to the cut. If blood is oozing out of the cut, this means you've cut a vein. Vein cuts will stop bleeding after about 10 minutes, with the proper care, and can usually be treated at home. As with any severe bleed, apply pressure using sterile gauze or dressings to the wound."

You should go to emergency care as soon as possible if the cut is deep enough for stitches. If the cut appears to be just below the surface of your skin and has minimal bleeding, you can treat it at home. Properly closing a deep wound within a few hours with stitches will minimize scarring and reduce your risk of infection. Generally, if the cut is less than 3 cm in length, less than 1/2 cm (1/4 inch) deep, and no lower structures are involved (muscle, tendon, etc. ), the cut is considered minor and can be treated without stitches."

If the cut on your finger is oozing blood, use a clean cloth or a sterile bandage to apply gentle pressure to the cut. Elevate the cut by raising your finger over your head, above your heart. Keep the dressing on the cut as you raise it over your head to soak up the blood."

These products will not make your cut heal faster, but they will prevent infection and encourage your body to start the natural healing process. Some people may develop a rash due to the ingredients in these ointments. Stop using the ointment if you develop a rash."
