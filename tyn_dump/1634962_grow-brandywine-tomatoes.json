Fill a pan with water and place the containers in the pan until the soil has soaked up all the water. Place the containers in a warm location, ideally about 75 degrees F (24 degrees C). Move your containers to a warm, well-lit location as soon as the seedlings pop up (about 5 or 6 days). Keep them there until the last frost, when you are ready to plant."

Make sure the soil is well draining and supplemented with organic material. Choose a location with lots of space and full sun. Because of their heavy foliage, Brandywine tomatoes need extra space to grow."
