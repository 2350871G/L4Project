The process only takes a few minutes, but is very important for your cat\u2019s appearance and overall health. Consistent grooming helps to remove loose hair that can otherwise form knots and tangles. Long-haired varieties may need to be brushed several times a week, or even on a daily basis.

You could also start buying dry foods that are specially formulated to promote dental health, such as Purina Veterinary Diet Feline Dental Health or Royal Canin Feline Health Oral Sensitive. Dental treats are another option. These work similarly to dry food, but contain additional compounds designed to clean and freshen your cat's teeth, gums, and breath. Cleaning Your Cat's Eyes and Ears Check your cat\u2019s eyes and ears regularly. Healthy eyes will be clear and glassy, with little tearing or discharge. Similarly, your cat\u2019s ears should be a light pink color with a thin layer of hair and no unusual buildup beyond a little bit of dirt or wax. Examine your cat somewhere with good lighting that will offer you a better look. Try to get in the habit of taking a look at your cat\u2019s eyes and ears every few days. The sooner you spot something unusual, the less of a problem it will be. Wipe away light discharge from the corners of your cat\u2019s eyes. Wet a washcloth or cotton ball with warm water and use it to gently blot any crusted or discolored areas you find. Apply continual pressure to dried streaks and globs until they begin to soften, then wipe the remaining residue to clear it away. This should be done every 2-3 days, or more frequently as discharge and discoloration begin to build up. You\u2019ll have a much easier time wiping away the normal sorts of secretions before they have a chance to harden. Be careful not to get too close to the eyeball itself. Scratching it could cause permanent damage. Use a cotton ball to swab the inside of your cat\u2019s ears. Go over the outer recesses of your cat\u2019s ears with a cotton ball to remove as much dust, wax, and other debris as possible. Avoid going too deep\u2014a good rule of thumb is to clean only what you can see. Start taking a peek inside your cat's ears on a weekly basis, and giving them a quick swab if necessary. Never use a cotton swab or any other implement that could damage your cat\u2019s ears. If your vet recommends an ear cleaner, you can use that to clean your cat\u2019s ears. However, never put water in your cat\u2019s ears, as it could cause an infection. Don\u2019t attempt to flush your cat\u2019s ears with drops unless specifically instructed to do so by your vet. Cats tend to be sensitive to the effect of fluid on the ear canal. Inspect your cat regularly for signs of infection. Occasional discharge is perfectly normal. Redness, swelling, and strange odors or secretions are not. If your cat exhibits any of these symptoms, book an appointment with your vet right away. They may need special treatment for their condition to improve. Mild inflammation may also cause your cat to shake its head or scratch at its ears compulsively. Other symptoms of a possible eye or ear infection include excessive discharge, loss of vision or hearing, and unusual behavior, such as changes in mood or activity. Showing Attention to Sensitive Areas Use cleansing wipes to freshen up your cat\u2019s coat. Every now and then, your kitty may get a little dirty, but not enough to require a real bath. When this happens, simply give it a quick once over with a moist cat wipe. A few strokes will leave your cat\u2019s fur soft, shiny, and smelling good. You should be able to find cat wipes at any major pet supply store. In addition to the ordinary variety, they\u2019re sometimes available in hypoallergenic and scent-free formulas, as well. Most cat wipes are made with mild natural cleansers, which means they\u2019re safe to use even on cats with sensitive skin. Keep your cat\u2019s claws trimmed. Hold your cat firmly but gently on your lap or in the crook of your arm and take hold of one paw. Press down on the pad to make the claws extend. Then, clip the sharp tip of each claw just enough to blunt it. When you\u2019re done, give your kitty a treat to reward it for its good behavior. Your cat\u2019s claws will likely need a light trim every 10 days to 2 weeks. Be extremely careful not to cut down into the \u201cquick,\u201d or the light pink part of the nail. There are many sensitive blood vessels and sensitive nerve endings there, and clipping it can be painful. Wipe down your cat\u2019s paws as needed. Use a damp towel or cat wipe to remove dust and dirt from your feline\u2019s feet. Make sure you get in between their toes and in the area around their paw pads, as well. This should be done at least twice a week, or more frequently if your cat spends a lot of time playing outside. Your cat\u2019s paws will be less likely to pick up debris if you clean and vacuum the floor of your home regularly. Inspect your cat for messy hindquarters. Sometimes when old, overweight, or long-haired cats go to the bathroom, their stool can get stuck and harden in the fur around their back legs. The best way to deal with this is to wet a washcloth with warm water and wipe down the area, lightly pulling at the hair to loosen as much dried waste as possible. You could also use a couple scented cat wipes, which have the added benefit of being disposable. Get in the habit of checking your cat\u2019s rear end every time it uses the litter box. Keeping the hair around your cat\u2019s backside neatly trimmed can help prevent future messes.",

        "Just as you brush your own teeth twice a day, your cat\u2019s teeth also need frequent cleaning.",

        "Once you\u2019re done, repeat on the bottom row, brushing up toward the roof of your cat\u2019s mouth.",
        "Brushing away from the gumline removes tartar and food debris from your cat\u2019s mouth rather than simply pushing it around.",

        "Squirt a small amount of the solution over your cat\u2019s freshly-scrubbed teeth and gums, or use a cotton swab to apply it.",
        "A quality oral rinse will help keep bacteria at bay for up to 12 hours.",
        "Look for products containing the chemical chlorhexidine, which has been shown to be effective for killing germs and loosening hardened plaque.",
        "An oral rinse will get your cat\u2019s teeth cleaner than brushing alone, but it\u2019s not a necessity.",

        "Put your cat on a tooth-healthy diet.",
        "Feed your feline friend a combination of wet and dry foods.",
        "Wet foods are rich in the kinds of essential nutrients that your cat needs to maintain a healthy coat and teeth, and are great for an occasional tasty treat.",
