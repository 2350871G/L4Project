                    "description": "Galvanized steel is extremely toxic when you weld it. It is covered in a zinc coating that is highly dangerous for humans when it\u2019s ingested. You need to take several steps to avoid the fumes. Start by getting a high-quality welding mask, a heavy-duty respirator, and a pair of welding gloves. Wear a welding apron to keep sparks from ruining or damaging your clothing. Get a respirator that is specifically designed for welding metal. A standard dust mask or dust respirator will not work. Some welders recommend drinking a glass of milk or taking a calcium supplement before welding galvanized steel. The calcium can help counteract the zinc fumes you may accidentally ingest."

If you\u2019re a DIY enthusiast and don\u2019t have access to a fume extractor, set up as many fans as you can behind you at to your side to blow the zinc fumes away from you. Weld outside if you can. If you can\u2019t, open up as many windows as you can. If you can\u2019t open windows, find some other way to ventilate the room. You cannot weld galvanized steel in a closed room. A fume extractor is a kind of heavy-duty vacuum that sucks up fumes as they\u2019re emitted. You may be able to rent one from a building supplies store or contractor if you don\u2019t have one."

You can also clamp a piece of metal directly, or the work surface that you\u2019re using. Ground the object itself if you\u2019re working outside.
