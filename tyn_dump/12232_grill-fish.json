                    "description": "This not only creates those masterful grill marks you see in restaurants, it actually makes it easier to flip the fish because it's on an angle. The general rule is a fish will take 8 minutes to cook through per inch of thickness, which means about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the grill, and let cook! Don't try to move the fish until you see that the skin side has a nice sear and looks crisp -- if you do, you risk it falling apart. If you're not sure when to check the fish to see this, try gently lifting with a fine-edged spatula after a few minutes. If it doesn't lift off the grate easily, let it cook a bit longer and check at 20-second intervals until it does."

A wide spatula with a thin, tapered edge does the job nicely by being able to slide easily under the fish and also large enough to support the whole fillet while you flip it. To make your life even easier, pair it with a flexible turner which can help hold the fish in place while the larger spatula slides underneath. While attempting the turn, if you feel too much resistance, just stop and walk away. If you've properly cleaned and oiled the grate, the fish will let you know when it's ready to turn by releasing itself from the grate."

Take a fork and gently pull back a flaky section in the center. If the fish is opaque with just a bit of translucent center, it's ready to come off. If using an instant read thermometer, the fish should be pulled when it registers between 130-135\u00b0F (54-57\u00b0C), letting it carry over to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) while it rests."

A whole fish is much harder to overcook than a small fillet; the skin protects the delicate flesh from heat and keeps the moisture in. The bones add a little extra flavor, too.

Fight the impulse to mess with the fish and move it around -- you'll rip the skin, lose some flesh, and throw off the cooking. Instead, stand there for 3-4 minutes. The fish is ready to be flipped when the skin no longer sticks to the grill. Generally, a fish that weighs 1/2 to 1 pound (.22 to .45 kg) will take about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Larger fish, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds (.7 to .9 kg), can take around twice that amount of time. Another general guideline for whole fish is 10 minutes of cooking per side, per inch of thickness."

        "Snip off any sharp fins with kitchen shears or scissors.",
        "Season the inside cavity.",
        "Sprinkle on a light coating of salt and pepper.",
        "There isn\u2019t a whole lot of room to stuff smaller fish, but at the very least you can add few slices of lemon and sprigs of your favorite herb.",
        "Other seasoning combinations to try:\nMinced garlic with rosemary\nOrange slices and paprika\nLime slices and cumin\nSliced green onion and tamari\nSliced red onion and basil\nMinced garlic mashed with butter Coat the fish with oil.",
        "Olive or coconut work nicely.",
        "The grates of your grill should already be oiled down, but your fish will need it too, especially to prevent sticking.",
        "Heat the grill to medium-high heat.",
        "Wait until the grates are nice and hot before setting the fish down.",
        "If you don't, it'll stick.",
        "Steady, medium heat is best, otherwise the skin will burn before the fish is done.",
        "If possible, set the tail farthest away from the flames, as the skinnier, tail-end of the fish cooks faster than the rest.",
        "Place on and wait.",
        "The crucial step is what you do after you place the fish on the hot grill: You wait.",
        "Fight the impulse to mess with the fish and move it around -- you'll rip the skin, lose some flesh, and throw off the cooking.",
        "Instead, stand there for 3-4 minutes.",
        "The fish is ready to be flipped when the skin no longer sticks to the grill.",
        "Generally, a fish that weighs 1/2 to 1 pound (.22 to .45 kg) will take about 5 to 7 minutes per side.",
        "Larger fish, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds (.7 to .9 kg), can take around twice that amount of time.",
        "Another general guideline for whole fish is 10 minutes of cooking per side, per inch of thickness.",
        "Flip the fish.",
        "To turn the fish, have your tongs in your \u201coff\u201d hand and a big spatula (oiled on both sides) in your good hand.",
        "Gently turn the fish over.",
        "It should come off the grates cleanly.",
        "If not, don\u2019t force it.",
        "Let the fish back down and come back at it with the spatula, using pressure to pry it off the grates.",
        "You don\u2019t want to pull the fish away from the grates and have half the skin and meat stick to the grill.",
        "Once the fish is flipped, let it cook for another 5-6 minutes.",
        "If the skin does stick to the grill, which is hard to avoid entirely, don\u2019t sweat it.",
        "The presentation might not be quite as pretty, but the fish will still taste just as good.",
        "Test for doneness.",
        "Insert a thin skewer or toothpick into the thickest part of the fish.",
        "It should slide all the way in easily.",
        "When fish is cooked the meat will flake easily with a fork and will appear opaque all the way through.",
        "The flesh should also pull easily away from the bones.",
        "Place on a platter with a few garnishes and enjoy!"
