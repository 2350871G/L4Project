Roll up fruits with removable peels, like bananas and citrus fruits, without any preparation at all. The layers of fabric around the fruit create a cushioned pouch to prevent bruising and keep the fruit clean. If you don\u2019t dry off rinsed fruit before rolling it up, the extra moisture can make the fruit mushy and unpleasant. Wrap multiple pieces of fruit separately for the most protection. For example, don\u2019t roll a banana and a peach together in the same cloth napkin. If you aren't using a lunch box or bag, pack the rolled fruit in your backpack last so that it sits on top of everything else and won't get smashed."
