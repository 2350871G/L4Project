    "text": " Using Cold Saltwater (Cloth Upholstery) Blot the stained area. You might benefit from using a cloth or paper towel to remove  excess blood. Don't rub the stain, as this can spread the blood stain or push it deeper into your upholstery. Use a dabbing motion to try and remove as much of the blood as you can, changing the cloth/paper towel when needed. Prepare a saltwater solution. Mix 2 teaspoons of salt with 1 cup of cold water and pour the solution into a spray bottle. Hot or even warm water can set the blood stain permanently to your car upholstery, so be sure to use cool water when applying the solution to your stain. Spray the saltwater solution on the stained area. If you don't have a spray bottle, dip a clean, white cloth in the saltwater solution and blot the affected area, changing your cloth as necessary. If you are working on a large stain, start on the edges and work your way towards the center; this will keep the stain from spreading. Blot the area with a dry cloth to absorb the excess solution. Repeat spraying and blotting until the blood stain is gone or the cloth is not absorbing any more blood. Rinse your blood stain thoroughly. Use a cloth dampened with cold water, rinse the remaining solution from the spot. Try not to scrub at the spot; dabbing motions will draw out the excess solution most effectively. Dry the area. Using a dry cloth or paper towel, dry the area by gently pressing it to the stained area. If the stain is still visible, you may have a permanent stain, but a stronger method might also solve your problem. Using a Dish Detergent\\/Water Solution (Cloth Upholstery) Create a solution with dish washing detergent and cold water. Mix 1 tablespoon of liquid dish washing detergent with 2 cups of cold water in a large bowl to make a detergent solution. Apply your solution to the stained area. Soak a clean, white cloth with your dish detergent/cold water solution and apply it to the affected area. Brush the stained area gently. A normal sized scrub brush might cause you to scrub too vigorously, pushing the stain deeper into the fabric. Using a toothbrush will keep you from brushing too hard, which might cause the stain to spread or permanently set into your upholstery. Blot the area. With a clean, wet cloth, rinse the solution using dabbing motions. For stubborn stains, re-apply your solution and scrub it again with your toothbrush. When you have finished scrubbing, you should rinse the area again with a clean, wet cloth. Make a final rinse. This time, using a cloth wet with cold water, rinse the remaining solution out of your upholstery. Rinse thoroughly with dabbing motions. Dry the area. Use a cloth towel to dry the area, pull out the excess moisture by blotting the towel to it until most of the moisture is removed. Using Baking Soda (Cloth Upholstery) Make a baking soda solution. Mix 1 part baking soda and 2 parts cold water in a large bowl to make your cleaning solution. The chemical properties of baking soda make it an effective and affordable stain removing option. Apply the solution. Using a clean cloth, apply your solution to the stained area of your upholstery. You should let it sit for 30 minutes before attempting to rinse the stain. Rinse the stained area. Using a cloth thoroughly dampened with cold water, rinse the remaining solution from your upholstery. Rinse thoroughly with dabbing motions until you have removed as much of the stain as possible. Dry the area. Use a dry towel to blot the remaining moisture, absorb and removing it from the fabric of your upholstery. Using a Meat Tenderizer Paste (Cloth Upholstery) Make your solution. Mix 1 tablespoon of meat tenderizer with 2 teaspoons of cold water in a small bowl to make a paste. Mix thoroughly until the paste is of uniform consistency. Meat tenderizer is a great option for removing old blood stains. Meat tenderizer breaks down proteins found in blood, making it an effective blood removing agent. Apply your paste liberally to the stain. Use your fingers to gently spread the paste on the blood stain.

To clear off any remaining paste, take a cloth that you've wet with cold water, and lightly dab until you no longer bring up any paste or stain. Be sure you rinse thoroughly, any paste you leave behind may get rubbed into your upholstery and stain it again. Dry the area. Excess moisture should be lifted from the rinsed area using a dry towel applied to the area with blotting motions. Using Hydrogen Peroxide (Cloth Upholstery) Apply hydrogen peroxide directly to the blood stained area. Moisten the affected area with 3% hydrogen peroxide and allow the stain to sit for about 30 seconds. Keep careful track of time, allowing the peroxide to sit for too long could do damage to your fabric. Hydrogen peroxide, while highly effective at cleaning blood stains, should be used as a last resort. This substance has bleaching properties, and can weaken the fabric of your upholstery or, in some cases, discolor it. Test a small hidden area before using hydrogen peroxide. Blot the foamy substance with a clean dry cloth. If any stain remains after you have blotted the area clean, you can repeat the process, reapplying the peroxide and blotting it until the blood stain is gone. Rinse the area. A clean cloth, thoroughly moistened with cold water, should be used to rinse the remaining solution from the stained area. Be sure to rinse the area well; leaving behind peroxide may discolor or damage your upholstery. Dry the area. By blotting the rinsed area with a clean, dry towel, you can pull out excess moisture until only a damp spot remains, which you can allow to air dry. Using Ammonia\\/Dish-washing Liquid Detergent (Vinyl Upholstery) Create your solution. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of dish-washing liquid and 1 tablespoon of ammonia in a spray bottle. Fill the bottle with cold water and mix your solution completely. Ammonia is a strong cleaner and can break down the protein in blood that makes it so hard to remove. It is important to dilute this cleaner before using it, and, as with any cleaning agent, it is best to test a small, hidden area first before using. Apply the solution. Spray the solution on the blood stain and allow it to sit for about 5 minutes. This will allow your cleaning solution to work its way deeply into the affected area, cleaning it more thoroughly. Scrub the affected area. You should be careful not to scrub too hard, and to prevent this from happening, you may want to consider using a toothbrush to scrub your stain. Blot the spot with a clean cloth. Repeat the spraying, scrubbing and blotting process until the blood stain is gone or until you no longer see the stain coming off on your clean cloth. Rinse the stained area. Rinse the remaining solution using a cloth dampened with cold water. It is important that you rinse thoroughly; leaving your cleaning solution behind may do damage to your upholstery. Dry the area. Pull the remaining moisture from the affected area by using a dry towel to dab it dry. Allow any remaining dampness to air dry. Using Dish Soap and Water Method (Leather Upholstery) Prepare your cleaning solution. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of liquid dish washing soap with a small amount of water in a small bowl to make a solution. Stir the solution until the soap is completely absorbed by the water. Soapy water can remove blood stains from leather, but the harsher the soap, the greater the chance you may do damage to your leather. Use a mild soap and test your cleaner on a small, out of sight spot to make sure your solution is right for your upholstery. Agitate the solution. Stir the solution until lots of soap suds are formed. This will more effectively clean the stain off your upholstery. Apply your solution to a soft cloth. A scrub brush or rough cloth can do damage to leather, especially high quality leather that's soft to the touch. Dip your soft cloth into the soap suds and wet it thoroughly before attempting to remove the stain. Wipe your stain gently. With your soapy cloth, wipe the stain repeatedly, using light pressure, until it begins to come off on your rag. For stubborn stains, you may need to repeat the process a few times, but when you no longer pull the stain from the affected area, you have removed as much as you are able with your solution. Rinse the stained area. Use a clean, damp cloth to rinse off any remaining solution. Make sure to rinse the area thoroughly, as soap can leave a film or do damage to your upholstery. Dry excess moisture. You can now use a dry towel to extract any remaining moisture from your upholstery. After you have dried as much as you are able, you can allow any residual dampness to air dry. Follow up with a leather conditioner. This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time. You can find leather conditioner at most hardware and auto stores, or in the auto section of larger retailers. Using Cream of Tartar (Leather Upholstery) Make your solution. Mix 1 part cream of tartar with 1 part lemon juice in a small bowl to make a paste. Be sure that your solution is thoroughly mixed throughout the solution before applying it to your stain. Cream of tartar is most useful for removing deep-colored stains, like blood, from leather. Apply the paste to your stain. You should apply the paste with a toothbrush and gently rub on the blood stain. Allow your paste to sit for 10 minutes before removing it. Remove the paste and reapply it if necessary. You can use a damp rag to brush off the paste. If the stain remains, try re-applying your paste until the stain is gone or you no longer remove anything from the discolored area. Rinse the stained area. Use a clean damp cloth to rinse off what remains of your cleaning paste. Make sure to rinse the area thoroughly, as leaving behind your cleaning paste might do damage to your leather upholstery. Dry the remaining moisture. Use a dry towel to soak up any excess moisture left over from your rinsing. When you have absorbed all the moisture you are able, you should allow the area to air dry. Follow up with a leather conditioner. This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time.
