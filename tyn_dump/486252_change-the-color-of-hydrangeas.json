        "If you\u2019ve decided to use coffee grounds, egg shells, citrus peels, or other organic materials, simply work them below the surface of the soil and water the plant as usual afterwards.Warning: Avoid overwatering your hydrangeas.",
        "Too much water is already bad for plants, and the addition of aluminum sulfate will only make it more harmful.",
        "Continue treating your hydrangeas every 2-4 weeks for up to half a year.",
        "The change of color won\u2019t happen right away.",
        "In fact, It may take weeks or even months before you begin to notice a difference.",
        "Keep up with your aluminum sulfate applications throughout the spring and summer, then scale it back in the fall and winter when the plant goes dormant.",
        "Ideally, the pH level of your growing soil should remain between 5.2 and 5.5 consistently.",
        "Introducing aluminum sulfate to your hydrangeas once they've entered dormancy could stunt their return in the spring or even cause them to die off.",
        "Monitor your plants closely and discontinue your applications if they appear to be in poor health.",
        "The species you're working with, as well as the specific conditions of your growing soil, may have an impact on the final coloration of your hydrangeas.",
        "Flowers with a deep pink or reddish cast, for example, may take on a hue that\u2019s more purple than delicate blue.",
        "Making Blue Flowers Pink Pick up a bag of ground gardening lime.",
        "This type of lime is also sometimes known as \u201cdolomitic lime.\u201d You\u2019ll find it at any gardening center, along with hardware stores and online retailers.",
        "Depending on where you get your lime, and how much you buy, it may cost $2-8 per 1 pound (450 g).",

        "You\u2019ll be using it to condition your hydrangeas regularly for up to 6 months at a time, so make sure you buy enough.",
        "Lime is highly alkaline, which means it serves to raise the pH of your planting soil, causing pale blue hydrangeas to become a rosy pink in the process.",
        "Spread the lime evenly over the soil at the base of your plants.",
        "Transfer the granulated lime to a garden spreader, or simply sprinkle it on using a measuring cup or gloved hand.",
        "Gardening experts recommend applying a ratio of 4 pounds (1,800 g) per 100 square feet (9.3 m) to avoid overloading the soil.",
        "You can apply lime immediately before or between your regular waterings.",
        "All that matters is that it makes direct contact with the soil.",
        "Be careful not to heap on too much lime at one time.",
        "Doing so will infuse your soil with huge quantities of magnesium, resulting in sickly, discolored leaves or, worse, dead hydrangeas.Tip: For best results, aim to keep the pH of your growing soil between 6.0 and 6.2.",
        "Testing your soil regularly will help you stay within the optimal range.",
        "Reapply the lime every 3-4 weeks during the growing season.",
        "Continue conditioning your hydrangeas throughout the spring and summer months while they\u2019re still actively growing.",
        "You should begin to witness a gradual change in color after several weeks or months.",
        "When you do, the effects will be quite stunning.",
        "Remember not to apply lime more than once in any 3-4 week interval.",
        "You\u2019ll usually get more pronounced and immediate results turning blue hydrangeas pink than you will turning pink ones blue.",
        "If you fail to keep up with your lime applications, your hydrangeas may revert to their original color as the chemical levels of the surrounding soil return to normal.",
        "You can resume your applications at the beginning of the following growing season.",
        "Feed your hydrangeas with a 25-10-10 fertilizer in late spring or fall.",
        "At the end of the growing season, apply a layer of phosphorus-rich fertilizer to all of your plants.",
        "Be sure to distribute the fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instruction for your climate and soil type.",
        "When you\u2019re done, wait until the following spring to resume your regular lime applications, if desired.",
        "It\u2019s important to use a fertilizer that contains high levels of phosphorus in order to prevent aluminum (which turns pink flowers blue) from creeping into the soil.",
        "Fertilization will restore vital nutrients to your growing soil and prevent the added magnesium in the lime from harming your hydrangeas."
