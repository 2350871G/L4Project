Because the decimal numbering system is based on factors of 10, you can transform a decimal number into a percentage by simply shifting the decimal point by two spaces to the right and then adding a % sign. If your decimal number consists of only one digit, you can add 0\u2019s on the right of the number, such as turning 0.5 into 0.50 or even 0.500. These all have the same numerical value. Decimal Shifting ExamplesConsider the example above of 1/2, which we converted to the decimal of 0.5. To change this decimal to a percentage, shift the decimal point two spaces to the right. First rewrite 0.5 as 0.50. Then when you shift the decimal point two spaces, you turn 0.50 into the number 50%.The example of 1/4, which has a decimal equivalent of 0.25, can be turned into the percentage 25%."

Adding Percentages ExampleIf each of six people draws a portion of the company\u2019s payroll, you can find out how much they represent together by just adding the relative percentages. If their respective shares are 10%, 5%, 8%, 22%, 10% and 8%, you can just add 10+5+8+22+10+8 = 63.

        "If you have a problem that is initially written as 25% x 30, just write the 25% as its decimal equivalent 0.25 and conduct the operation.",
        "This would be 0.25 x 30 which gives the result of 7.5.",
        "Similarly, if you have a division problem of 200 \u00f7 10%, rewrite this as 200 \u00f7 0.10 and enter this into your calculator.",
        "You will get the result of 2000.",
        "The last result may appear surprising, if you expect division to produce a smaller result than the starting number.",
        "However, you should understand that division by a number less than one will always lead to an increase by the reciprocal of that number.",
        "For example, dividing by 1/10 is the same as multiplying by 10.",
        "Dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2.",
        "Calculating a Percentage of a Whole Number Perform multiplication to find the percent \u201cof\u201d a number.",
        "A common calculation involving percentages is to find some percent \u201cof\u201d another number.",
        "For example, if you are in a restaurant you may want to tip 15% \u201cof\u201d your total bill.",
        "When working with percentages, the word \u201cof\u201d carries the same meaning as \u201ctimes\u201d or \u201cmultiply.\u201d Therefore, 15% \u201cof\u201d 100, for example, means the same as 15% x 100.",
        "Convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.",
        "To calculate the percentage of the whole number, you need to first turn the percentage into a decimal as already described.",
        "Then simply multiply.",
        "Finding the Percentage of a Whole Number ExampleTo find 15% of 100, rewrite the 15% as 0.15.",
        "Then just multiply 0.15 x 100, to get the solution of 15.",
        "Write your result without a percentage symbol.",
        "When you set out to find a percentage of a whole number, your result will be a number and not a percentage.",
        "You may begin with a percentage symbol, but when you convert that percentage to a decimal to conduct the multiplication, your answer will no longer have a percentage symbol.",
        "In the example of 15% of 100, the result is the whole number 15.",
        "Using the % Key on a Calculator Find the % key on your calculator.",
        "Most simple calculators will contain a key with the % symbol.",
        "More advanced, graphing calculators may not have this key because the makers expect that you can operate without it.",
        "But many more basic calculators will have it.",
        "Experiment with the % key for decimal conversions.",
        "The simplest use of the % key is to convert any number from its percentage form to its decimal form.",
        "Just enter the number and press the % button, and the calculator will show the decimal equivalent.",
        "Using the % Key ExampleTo represent the number 4% on your calculator, just press the button 4 and then %.",
        "Your calculator will turn the number 4 into 0.04, which is the decimal equivalent.To change the number 82.5% into a decimal, just type the buttons 8, 2, .",
        ", 5, %.",
        "The calculator will now show the value of 0.825.",
        "Use the % key for calculations.",
        "The % key on your calculator makes certain calculations very simple.",
        "Suppose you want to calculate a tip amount, and you want to find 15% of the total bill of $75.32.",
        "If you have your calculator available, you will enter the buttons 15% x 75.32.",
        "You should get the result of 11.298, which represents a tip of $11.30.",
        "Whenever you are using a calculator for percentage calculations, you should make sure to press the Clear (C) or All Clear (AC) button before starting.",
        "As you enter the numbers for this calculation, you should notice that as soon as your hit the % button, your number of 15 converts to .15.",
        "The calculator will the proceed to calculate .15 x 75.32."
