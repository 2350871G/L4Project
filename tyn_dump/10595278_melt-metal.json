You can make your own using a small empty propane tank or metal bucket, plaster of paris, sand, metal pipe, charcoal briquettes, and a steel can. However, it\u2019s probably easier buy one premade from a welding supply company or online retailer. Small foundries that are available for purchase online or that are built at home tend to work best for melting aluminum, as aluminum melts at a relatively low temperature. Premade foundries are typically heated with propane, so you will need a tank of propane in addition to the foundry."

Typically, the easiest place to set it up is on a large slab of concrete, such as a driveway, outside.

There will be fumes created when melting metal, so it\u2019s important not to do it in a confined area."
