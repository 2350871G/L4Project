Check planter boxes, raised flower beds, cracks in cement work, and the edges of lawns for purslane. Purslane begins growing after the last frost of the season. Look for purslane four to six weeks after the first frost in spring or anytime during summer."

When in the sunlight, you may see small yellow flowers on this plant. Each flower should have five petals. All parts of common purslane are edible.

Harvest purslane in this fashion until you\u2019ve collected as much as you desire or have exhausted the plant. Harvesting purslane earlier in the day will result in a stronger lemony flavor in the plant. The intensity of this flavor decreases with later harvesting times. The leaves of purslane are ideal for harvest when young. Young leaves are flexible and have a slight shine. As you cut the purslane, remove dead leaves, dirt, twigs, and other debris from the plants to make cleaning them easier later."
