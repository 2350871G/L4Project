You'll get both the seeds and the gel surrounding the seeds. Spoon this mixture into a clean cup, bowl, or other container. You don't need to separate the seeds from the gel, as this will happen naturally later on in the fermentation process. Label the container with the name of the tomato seeds you are saving.
