Try to make the folds as crisp as possible, as this will help them to stay in place. Use a hole punch to make a hole through the middle of the folded tree. Draw a dot in the middle of the folded tree. Hold the folds together tightly while you place the hole punch over the dot and make a hole. Single hole punches are easiest for this activity, as it is easy to identify where the hole will be made. Thread a paper straw through the hole. Push the paper gently down the straw until it reaches the middle of the straw. Consider using a Christmas coloured straw \u2013 red, gold, and silver are great festive options. Purchase paper straws from a craft store or a supermarket. If you don\u2019t have a paper straw, use a plastic straw instead. Unfold the paper so that the tree sits evenly over the straw.

If your tree looks too small on the straw, simply trim the straw down to your desired length. Note that this tree doesn\u2019t stand up on its own. Using Plastic Bottles Draw a Christmas tree onto a soda bottle. Start the trunk at the base and draw the tip of the tree at the top of the bottle.
