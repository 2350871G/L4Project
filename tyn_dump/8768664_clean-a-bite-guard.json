Run the bite guard under the water to loosen debris and plaque. Apply a small squirt of liquid soap. This can be hand soap or dish soap. Work the soap across the surface and in the hollow areas. If you don't have liquid soap, work bar soap into a lather. Smear the suds across the surface. Brush the bite guard. Make sure the toothbrush has soft or ultra-soft bristles.

Deep Cleaning with Vinegar and Peroxide Place your bite guard in a glass or container. Any container wide enough to fit your bite guard will do. This can be an old hummus container, large coffee mug, or wide drinking glass. Make sure you can easily place your bite guard on the bottom of the container without forcing it in. Avoid a metal container. The acid in the vinegar could corrode the container and leave deposits on your bite guard. Soak your bite guard in vinegar. Pour enough white distilled vinegar into the container to cover the bite guard. Allow it to soak for 30 minutes. Set a timer, if necessary. When the 30 minutes is up, rinse the bite guard and the container with lukewarm water. Follow up with a hydrogen peroxide soak. Hydrogen peroxide will bleach discolorations out of the bite guard while neutralizing the vinegar taste. Use enough peroxide to submerge the bite guard.

Lay it hollow side-down to allow the water to drain from the surface properly. This should take 15 to 30 minutes. Put the bite guard back in its case when it's completely dry. Deep Cleaning with Cleaning Tablets Purchase denture or retainer cleaner. These cleaners usually come in the form of cleaning tablets that dissolve in water.
