Pat the peels dry with a clean towel, and carefully chop the peels into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes. The pieces have to be small enough to fit into the opening of a pop bottle. You can use a variety or mixture of citrus peels to make your homemade enzyme cleaner, including lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange. It\u2019s important to use fresh citrus peels that aren't dried out or rotting. Dried peels won\u2019t contain enough citrus oil for cleaning, and rotten ones will cause the mixture to mold."

Repeat this process at least three times a day for two weeks to prevent the bottle from exploding. After two weeks, reduce the venting to once a day, as most of the sugar will have been converted, so less carbon dioxide will be produced. As the yeast eats the sugar in the mixture, it will convert the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide. This gas will build up in the bottle when the lid is on. It\u2019s important to leave the cap on and tight during this process, because the yeast needs an oxygen-free environment to ferment properly. Oxygen will also allow bacteria and mold to grow in the mixture."
