This will create a simple top that you can sew the peplum skirt onto. Cut the excess threads when you are finished sewing. Be careful not to sew across the neckline or armholes of the shirt. Cutting the Skirt Piece Measure the shirt all the way around the bottom. Use a soft measuring tape to get the total length of the bottom of your shirt. Hold 1 end of the measuring tape against the bottom edge of the shirt and then wrap it all the way around the bottom edge. Record this measurement on a piece of paper.Tip: If the shirt is fitted around your waist, then you can take your waist measurement for this part instead.

Subtracting 0.5 in (1.3 cm) gives you a result of 11 in (28 cm). Use a calculator to make this easier and make sure to write down your result. Mark the radius on the folded fabric by measuring from the corner. Fold the fabric in half and hold the end of the measuring tape at the corner. Then, measure from the corner to the radius.
