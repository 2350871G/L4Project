Your last round should reach the bottom of your base round without stretching. You may be tempted to cheat, but this will result in a scrunchie that looks small and flat rather than full and ruffled. When you are done, it is time to join the two ends into a doughnut shape. Break off the yarn, leaving about 15 inches (40 cm) of yarn from the hook. You're going to use this yarn to sew up the edges. Thread a blunt knitting needle onto the end of the yarn and sew the two edges together. Make sure that the stitches on both rounds line up so that you get a smooth join. Tie a knot in the end of the yarn and break it off. Leave about 4 inches (10 cm) of yarn. Pull the remaining thread into the inside of the scrunchie. You can do this with the yarn needle or the hook.
