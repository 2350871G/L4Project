        "Scrape off as much of the adhesive as possible with the edge of a spoon.",
        "Use the edge of a metal spoon to carefully scrape away at the adhesive.",
        "Stop and move on to another technique if none of the adhesive is coming off so you don\u2019t damage the fabric by scraping too aggressively.",
        "If the glue is on a particularly delicate type of fabric, like lace or silk, skip this step so you don\u2019t accidentally stretch or tear it.",
        "Wipe the glue gently with acetone if it won\u2019t damage the fabric.",
        "Soak a cotton ball or cotton swab with acetone and test it on a hidden area of the fabric to make sure it doesn\u2019t cause any discoloration.",
        "Rub the acetone onto the area with the stuck-on adhesive until you have removed as much as will come off.",
        "Glue generally comes off in layers, so be patient and keep applying more acetone to try and remove as much of the adhesive as you can.",
        "Keep in mind that you might not be able to get 100% of it off.",
        "If the fabric is fairly durable, such as thick upholstery on a couch or another piece of furniture, you can also try using an old toothbrush to scrub the affected area with acetone.",
        "Wash the fabric in a laundry machine with laundry detergent if possible.",
        "Put pieces of clothing or other portable fabric items that have industrial glue on them into a laundry machine and wash them with laundry detergent as you normally would, avoiding hot water.",
        "Check if the glue stain is removed after the first wash and repeat the wash if there is any residue left.",
        "It\u2019s best not to dry the fabric until the glue is completely removed to avoid setting it into the fabric further.",
        "If you can\u2019t get it all off, hang the fabric to air dry rather than drying it in a machine using heat.",
        "This way, the glue may continue to come out with repeated washing.",
        "You can try pre-treating glue stains by rubbing laundry detergent or a specific pre-treatment product into them if regular washing doesn\u2019t do the trick."
