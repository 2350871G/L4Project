                    "description": "Having one main flower repeated throughout the bouquet will look more elegant than having a random assortment of blooms. You can choose any flowers you like, but make sure the stems are at least 6 in (15 cm) long to ensure they'll be long enough to reach the bouquet holder. Roses are a common option for a wedding bouquet, especially white or red roses. Other popular options include stargazer lilies, peonies, anemones, ranunculus, dahlias,  and hydrangeas. It's up to you whether you want to use all the same color of your primary bloom, or if you want an assortment of shades! To narrow down your options, look at a picture of each flower and think about how each one would look against your dress. For example, if you have a very simple gown, an ornate flower like a hydrangea could provide a pretty contrast. On the other hand, you could choose a flower with special significance to you, like the first flower your fiance ever gave you or a bloom that reminds you of a loved one."

You can choose 1 accent flower, or you can use more than one kind of flower if you want an even more diverse bouquet.

Good options for accent flowers include calla lilies, lavender, spray roses, hypericum, and orchids. You can choose accent blooms that are the same color as your primary flower for a monochrome look, or you can choose a coordinating color to add contrast to your bouquet.

        "Imagine creating an upside-down teardrop shape that\u2019s rounded at the top and full on the sides, then comes to a narrow point at the bottom.",
        "The length of the greenery on the top and sides will depend on the size of the bouquet you want to create and how far you want the greenery to extend, but it should be just a little shorter than your flowers, unless you have a few pieces you want to showcase.",
        "Adding the Flowers Start by arranging your primary blooms.",
        "Place your largest, prettiest flowers in the center of your arrangement as the focal point, then work the remaining flowers all the way around the bouquet holder.",
        "Arrange the top flowers so they\u2019re pointing straight up, the blooms around the circumference of the holder so they\u2019re horizontal, and the longest, cascading stems so they\u2019re pointing downward.Tip: If you have a flower with a weak stem, push a pin through the head of the bloom, then wrap the stem with wire and floral tape to stabilize it.",
        "As you\u2019re arranging the flowers, alternate putting a few on the top, then a few on the sides, and so on.",
        "This causes the stems to interlock in a grid pattern, which will help prevent the flowers from falling out of your bouquet.",
        "Space each type of flower evenly throughout the bouquet.",
        "If it isn\u2019t symmetrical, it won\u2019t create the effect that the flowers are cascading down.",
        "Trim your flower stems so the shortest go on top and the longest go on bottom.",
        "As you start to arrange your bouquet, use a sharp pair of floral shears to trim each stem to the length you want it to be.",
        "The stems on the bottom of your bouquet should be the longest, with medium-length stems in the middle of the arrangement, and the shortest blooms on top.",
        "The length of the stems will depend on the size of the bouquet you\u2019re creating, but they\u2019ll likely only need to be about 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) at the top, whereas you may not need to trim the stems on the bottom at all.",
        "It\u2019s best to trim your flowers one at a time as you place them in the arrangement so you can customize your bouquet.",
        "When you\u2019re trimming the stems, try to cut the flowers on the top and middle so they\u2019ll extend slightly past the greenery.",
        "Cut thicker stems at an angle so they'll be easy to insert into the bouquet holder.",
        "Add your accent flowers around your primary blooms.",
        "Now that you have your greenery and primary blooms arranged, you can start filling in the body of your bouquet with the accent flowers that you chose.",
        "Continue alternating between adding flowers to the top and sides of the bouquet, criss-crossing the stems to secure them.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about making the bouquet look perfectly full just yet; it\u2019s more important that you space your accent flowers evenly throughout the bouquet.",
        "Fill in any remaining gaps with baby\u2019s breath or greenery.",
        "Look at the bouquet from the top, front, and sides, and use your filler to completely cover up any gaps that are left.",
        "Depending on the size of the blooms you used and how closely they\u2019re arranged, you may only need a few sprigs, or you may need to tuck small sprays throughout the entire bouquet to fill it out.",
        "Baby\u2019s breath is inexpensive and delicate, so buy more than you think you\u2019ll need just in case your bouquet doesn\u2019t look as full as you\u2019d like when you\u2019re finished.",
        "Not only will this ensure the bouquet holder isn\u2019t visible in your wedding photographs, but it also helps secure the grid you made that\u2019s holding the larger stems in place.",
        "Keep your flowers in a cool place overnight or until you need them.",
        "It's best to assemble your bouquet no more than 1 day before you'll need it.",
        "If you have a floral cooler, you can keep your bouquet there, but if not, you'll need to find a cool place away from direct sunlight where your flowers won't be disturbed, like a shaded, out-of-the-way corner in a cool bedroom.",
        "Don't place your bouquet in a regular refrigerator.",
        "The moisture will cause the flowers to wilt.",
        "If you need to make your bouquet more than 1 day ahead of time, either choose hearty flowers like posies, lilies, and succulents, or opt for artificial flowers."
