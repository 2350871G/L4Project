        "Inspect the bar slope.",
        "The bars are the part of the saddle that form the gullet and hold the saddle on the horse\u2019s back.",
        "The bars run along the length of the spine, and should be in contact with the entirety of the horse\u2019s back if the saddle fits.",
        "If the bars are too straight, they will only meet with the withers and the croup of the horse\u2019s back, causing briding.",
        "If the bars are too curved, they will touch only the center of the horse\u2019s back and cause the saddle to rock in between the withers and the croup.",
        "Make sure the bar flare is visible at the front of the saddle tree.",
        "The bars flare outwards at the front and back of the saddle to prevent chafing and rubbing while riding.",
        "If the saddle fits, the front of the saddle tree should flare out slightly.",
        "If the saddle is too small, there won\u2019t be any bar flare evident and it will be very uncomfortable to your horse.",
        "Check the bar width.",
        "Some horses are very wide across their backs, while others are very narrow.",
        "To tell if the saddle fits your horse\u2019s back size, see where the bars sit.",
        "If they rest very high up, almost on top of the spine, then the saddle is too narrow.",
        "If the bars slide down very far past the spine, then the saddle is too wide.",
        "The bar width is closely related to the gullet clearance; a too-narrow bar width will cause a larger gullet space while a too-wide bar width will cause little to no gullet clearance.",
        "Test the girth.",
        "When you get the girth tightened on your horse, you should be able to fit four fingers side-by-side between the front of the girth and your horse\u2019s shoulders.",
        "An ill-fitting saddle may cause the girth to fall forwards or slide backwards.",
        "Pay attention to your horse\u2019s response.",
        "Throughout the saddle testing/fitting process, keep an eye on your horse.",
        "If the saddle isn\u2019t the right size or uncomfortable, your horse will show it in their body language.",
        "Ask a professional to measure your horse for the best fit.",
        "Many saddle companies employ professionals who will come to your location and do a fitting.",
        "Call or email the company you are considering purchasing from to see if they offer this service.",
        "Another good option is to ask you vet if they would be willing to do a fitting.",
        "Veterinarians are knowledgeable about anatomy and well-qualified to fit your horse for a saddle."
