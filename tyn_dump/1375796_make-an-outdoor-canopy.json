Leave all the excess rope that is not tied around the grommets and tent poles. You will use it to secure the canopy to the ground by tying it to tent stakes. Stainless steel tent poles are the best poles to use for your canopy because they are sturdy and they don\u2019t rust, but you can use bamboo or wooden poles instead.

Make sure it is big enough to cover the area you want to shade. Take notes of the measurements of the tarp for when you drill holes in the wall. You can use a tarp instead of a canvas drop cloth. You can get a canvas drop cloth for the canopy at a home center. If it doesn\u2019t have grommets in it, ask the home center staff if they can put some in using a grommet tool. Drill two holes in the wall closer than the length of 1 side of the drop cloth. Make the holes at least 1 ft (0.30 m) closer than the distance between 2 grommets on 1 side of the drop cloth, and 7 ft (2.1 m) high off the ground. This will allow you to create a peak in the canopy at the end. Make sure to use a drill bit slightly smaller than the screw eyes or hooks that you will screw in. Screw 2 screw eyes or hooks into the wall. Place metal screw eyes or hooks into the holes you drilled and screw them in tightly. These will be used to secure the drop cloth to the wall. Screw eyes are metal loops that have a screw on one end. You can get metal screw eyes or hooks at a hardware store. Tie the drop cloth to the screw eyes or hooks with strong cord. Use a short length of cord to tie 2 corners of the canopy to the wall. Tie the cord around each grommet at 1 end and around the screw eyes or hooks at the other end. Try to tie the drop cloth as close to the wall as possible. Tie a pole to each front corner and stick the poles in the ground. Use 2 fresh 10 ft (3.0 m) pieces of strong cord to tie 1 tip of the poles to the grommets by tying 1 end of the cord through the grommet and around the tips of the tent poles. Stretch out the canopy so it is taut and push the other ends of the poles firmly into the ground. You can use aluminum tent poles, bamboo poles, or wooden poles. Make sure to leave the excess cord attached to the poles because you will use it to secure the canopy with tent stakes. Stretch out the 2 cords in the front and tie them to tent stakes in the ground. Pull the cords out from each corner as far as they will go, and place tent stakes in the ground where the ends reach. Tie the cord to the stakes to secure the canopy. It is a good idea to have someone hold the tent poles firmly in place while you stretch out and secure the cords. Put 1 longer pole in the middle of the canopy to create a peak. Place 1 end of a 8 ft (2.4 m) pole underneath the canopy in the middle. Push the other end of the pole firmly into the ground. The tension of the canopy and the 1 end of the pole pushed into the ground will hold the middle pole in place.
