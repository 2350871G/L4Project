The bag will be weighed along with your produce, so avoid heavy fabrics. Some common materials for produce bags include cotton, muslin, and synthetic and natural mesh. Cotton fabric: Stretchy, soft, and breathable. Good for holding a large volume of produce, but may not be as strong as some other options. Muslin: Can come in various thicknesses, but use a thin version for these bags. Not very stretchy, but durable and can be patterned. Nylon mesh: A very strong material, with large holes in the material making it look woven. Natural mesh: Similar to the nylon mesh, this is a durable and strong material, but made with natural fibers instead of synthetic ones."

Use your fabric marker to mark where you will cut the fabric away. If you have an original piece of fabric slightly smaller or larger than 2 yd (1.8 m), try to get as close to these measurements as you can.

If you end up with slightly more or less than eight rectangles, make sure you at least have an even number available to you. You need two pieces of fabric per bag. Cutting, Layering, and Pinning Cut cotton rope into four 24 in (61 cm) long strands. These ropes will be used to create a drawstring at the top of the bag.

Sewing the Bag Together Fold the top 1 in (2.5 cm) in half to the line. The top 1 in (2.5 cm) should not go over the line you marked earlier, instead it should be folded in half so the hole the rope will be inserted into is about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide, creating a hollow lip at the top of the bag.
