There are several ways to determine how to address their needs with your documentation. Look at the job titles your prospective users hold. A system administrator is likely expert with a number of software applications, while a data entry clerk is more likely to know only the application he or she currently uses to enter data. Look at the users themselves. Although job titles generally indicate what people do, there can be considerable variation in how certain titles are used within a given organization. By interviewing prospective users, you can get a feel for whether your impressions of what their job title indicates are accurate or not. Look at existing documentation. Documentation for previous versions of software, as well as functional specifications, provide some indication as to what the user will need to know to use the program. Keep in mind, however, that end users are not as interested in how the program works as they are in what it can do for them.

Many help files are written in this format, particularly context-sensitive help that displays a relevant topic whenever a user clicks the Help button on a particular screen. A user guide format explains how to use the software to perform a particular task. User guides are often formatted as printed guides or PDFs, although some help files include topics on how to perform particular tasks.
