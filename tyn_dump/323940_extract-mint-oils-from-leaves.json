While apple cider vinegar or glycerin can be used instead, the final tincture will be much less strong and have a shorter shelf life. White vinegar will also work, but have the same effect. These are good for children that cannot drink alcohol, although if you use this for baking, the alcohol bakes out. Homemade tinctures, just like vanilla extract you would buy in a store, are normally used in such small doses that the alcohol does not have a noticeable effect. For dried mint leaves, use vodka containing 45\u201360% alcohol (90\u2013120 proof). For fresh mint leaves, since they already contain water, use vodka or Everclear with 90\u201395% alcohol (180\u2013190 proof)."
