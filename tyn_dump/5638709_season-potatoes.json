Finely mince the leaves. For parsley, use the entire herb\u2014stem and leaves. Just chop off the bottom of the stems and discard them, and then finely chop the rest of the parsley. Before cutting fresh herbs, rinse them off and make sure they are completely dry. Wet herbs can turn into mushy herbs when they are chopped."
