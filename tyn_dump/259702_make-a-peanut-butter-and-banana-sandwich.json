This will make it easier to eat and less-likely to fall apart. Finished.  Making a Grilled Sandwich Pre-heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly coat it with cooking spray. For a richer option, you can use 2 tablespoons of butter or other oil instead. Spread 1 tablespoon of peanut butter onto each slice of bread. You can use any type of bread you like, but whole wheat works best. You can also speed up the grilling time by lightly toasting the bread first. If you like honey, drizzle some honey over the peanut butter. Sprinkle it with cinnamon for an added touch. If you like chocolate, spread 1 tablespoon of Nutella (or other chocolate-hazelnut spread) onto one of the bread slices instead of peanut butter. Peel and slice a banana.

Making Quesadillas Spread some peanut butter over one side of the tortilla. Make sure that you cover the entire surface. Peel and slice a banana.

Scatter the chocolate chips over the banana slices. You can also use chocolate sauce instead, and drizzle it across the banana slices. Fold the tortilla in half. Press the peanut buttered side of the tortilla onto the chocolate and banana side. Gently press down on it with a spatula to seal it. Cook the quesadilla in a skillet over medium-low heat, turning once. Use a spatula to flip the quesadilla over and gently pat it down. It is done when it turns golden brown and crispy on both sides.
