The first few times you drink kombucha, stick to 3 or 4 fluid ounces (89 or 118 mL) or less 2 to 3 times per day. Kombucha changes your microbiome, or gut bacteria. Drinking a large amount without easing yourself into it can cause an upset stomach."

Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, swelling of the hands or face, trouble breathing, and an itchy sensation in the mouth or throat. Seek medical attention if you experience symptoms of a food allergy. If you get an upset stomach, drinking water may help you feel better.

Drinking any more than that doesn't offer any extra health benefits. Other authoritative agencies suggest capping daily consumption at 4 fluid ounces (120 mL), so start from there and see how it affects you.

However, there's not much evidence for most of the health benefits attributed to kombucha. If it makes you feel good, drink it, but try not to think of it as a cure-all. There is evidence that the healthy bacteria found in kombucha and other fermented products are good for the digestive system.

Read the ingredients, which should list tea, water, sugar, and culture, along with natural flavorings, such as ginger or citrus. Finally, unless you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, choose unpasteurized kombucha. Pasteurization kills the good bacteria along with the bad. Since kombucha is acidic, it's safe to drink unpasteurized. Note that pasteurized products are the safest choice if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant. Brewing kombucha in plastic or steel can cause leeching, so products brewed and stored in glass are the best choice. Dark glass is also preferable to clear glass. Dark glass helps filter light, which can damage probiotic bacteria."
