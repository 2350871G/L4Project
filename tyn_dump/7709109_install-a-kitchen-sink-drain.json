Move the drainpipe so it\u2019s touching the bottom of the brass tailpiece and the 2 edges are aligned. Don\u2019t force or jerk the drainpipe or you could break it. Slide the connector ring on the drainpipe up the brass tailpiece and tighten it. The drainpipe has a small plastic ring that is threaded to fit onto the tailpiece. Slide it up the drainpipe and align the threads with the threads at the bottom of the brass tailpiece. Screw the connector onto the brass tailpiece. Tighten the connector with a wrench. Take an adjustable wrench and fit it over the connector you screwed onto the brass tailpiece. Turn the wrench to tighten the connector so the drainpipe is connected to the tailpiece and is sealed. Be careful not to overtighten the connector or you could crack the plastic. Turn the sink on to test the drain.
