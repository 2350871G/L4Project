If you live in an urban place without many trees, go to your local nursery or craft store to look for supplies like these:\nBright fall leaves. Choose leaves that represent fall in your region, whether they're bright red maple leaves, yellow birch or hickory, or purple black gum leaves. Evergreen foliage. Evergreen branches from firs, pines and other green trees will give your wreath a lovely scent. Stalks of wheat or golden-hued grasses. Fall is harvest time, and stalks of wheat and other wheat-colored plants are a pleasant reminder that the seasons are changing. Fall flowers. Chrysanthemums are a good choice in many regions, especially those that come in fall hues like red, maroon, orange and yellow. Other regional foliage. Don't limit yourself to traditional symbols of fall; choose plants that are special to you. In some places fall comes with a burst of pink and blue nettles, and in other places it is characterized by evergreen branches dripping with rain. If something has meaning to you and you think it would look good on a wreath, bring it home."

Alternate leaves with flowers in a circular pattern, or arrange the items in threes: maple leaf bunch, chrysanthemum bunch, and wheat stalks, for example. Make a color wheel design.
