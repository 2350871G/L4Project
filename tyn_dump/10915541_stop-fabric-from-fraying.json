                    "description": "Lay your fabric on a hard, flat surface with the back facing up. With the fabric\u2019s edge laid out in front of you horizontally, place the tape along the top of the edge. Cover about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) of the fabric\u2019s edge with the tape. Let the excess tape fix the fabric loosely to your work surface. Cut a new, clean line through the taped fabric, below the fraying edge. Leave the tape on the edge to keep it from fraying. Scotch tape is a clear, adhesive tape. Select a matte tape as opposed to one with a glossy finish because it will be less noticeable. This method will not last if the piece is washed, but it is helpful when cutting straight edges in hard-to-handle fabrics. It is also useful for pillows or other projects where the seams are hidden and subject to minimal washing."

Use a cotton swab or toothpick to spread the glue evenly. Avoid using too much glue as it can leave dark spots on your fabric once it has dried. Alternatively, use the same process to apply the glue but then fold the glue-covered edge of the fabric over and press it down to create a hem."

You use them as you would use scissors, cutting a new edge onto your fabric. Instead of a straight edge, however, the shears cut in a jagged-tooth pattern. This cut will prevent the edges from fraying. This is a popular beginner-level method for dealing with fraying edges. For additional stability, apply adhesive to the cut edge with a cotton swab or toothpick."
