If the touch-up paint doesn\u2019t come off easily with your fingernail or a toothpick, move on to more rigorous removal methods. Using a Lacquer Thinner Wash the section of the vehicle with the dried touch-up paint. Squirt a mild dish detergent into a bucket, and fill the bucket with water from a hose or outdoor tap.

Always make sure the area with the dried car touch-up paint is clean before working on it. Otherwise you may rub grit and dust into sections of paint that you weren\u2019t planning to remove.

Use a Q-tip to rub a small amount of solvent onto the dried touch-up paint to help soften it.

You can purchase lacquer thinner from your local automotive supply shop. Try prep solvent or mineral spirits if you cannot find a lacquer thinner. Sanding Off Dried Touch-Up Paint Apply car masking tape to the area around the dried touch-up paint. Masking tape will allow you to avoid accidentally removing extra paint. Use the masking tape to box in the dried touch-up paint. Car masking tape can be purchased at any local automotive supply store. Rub the dried touch-up paint gently with 150-grit sandpaper. 150-grit sandpaper is relatively coarse and will remove the softened touch-up paint. Press firmly when you\u2019re sanding, and sand back and forth in short, even strokes. It\u2019s OK if you scratch up all of the paint within the masking-tape box, but avoid scratching tape outside of the masking tape. Remember that the lower the grit number, the more coarse the sandpaper. Sandpaper that is too coarse can damage your car, so avoid using anything coarser than 150. Brush away any paint dust or chips with a soft cloth or towel. After sanding, the section of car door you\u2019ve been working on will be covered in a light coat of paint dust. Wipe this off and inspect the door to see if you\u2019ve fully removed the touch-up paint. If not all of the touch-up paint has been removed, sand the door again.

The 150-grit paper will remove dried globs of paint, and 600-grit will smooth out the area after the dried paint is removed. Remove the tape and brush away any paint dust. Use a clean towel to clean off the car door and remove any lingering paint chips. The area is now ready for you to apply fresh touch-up paint. Throw away the tape once you\u2019ve removed it from the car door.",
