Use of other materials (i.e. ceramic, metal, and/or plastic) may leach chemicals (including lead if using ceramic) into the ferment due to the natural acidic generation within the kombucha fermentation process. Some have claimed good success with stainless steel and food-grade plastic, but glass is preferred. Anywhere between a quart to a gallon should be a good starting point. Most people start with 1oz per day, as the digestive tract may need some time to get used to the kombucha. The volume of the container thereafter should be based on the rate at which you will be consuming the beverage, as well as the available area in which you can let the ferment sit. Brewing equipment, such as 5-gallon carboys for brewing beer or wine will work very well.",

Using apple cider vinegar or plain vinegar to wash hands and any other materials you will be using is a good substitute for antibacterial soaps.
