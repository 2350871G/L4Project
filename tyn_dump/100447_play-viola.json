        "After all your other fingers are in place, hook your index finger around the bow\u2019s stick.",
        "Press the pad of your finger down on the side of the stick so you have a firm grip.",
        "Don\u2019t touch the hair with your fingers since you could leave fingerprints on them and cause your bow to slip while playing.",
        "Playing Notes with the Bow Set the bow on the A string just above the bridge.",
        "Place the bow in between the fingerboard and the bridge.",
        "The bridge is the arch-shaped piece that the strings rest on near the bottom of your viola.",
        "your bow on the A string so it\u2019s on the side of the bridge closest to your hand.",
        "Use the hair on your bow that\u2019s closest to the frog and keep it at a near vertical angle.",
        "The A string is the easiest one to start on since it\u2019s the closest to the bow.",
        "Slide the bow across the string to play it.",
        "Move your hand down to pull the bow across the string.",
        "Don\u2019t press hard on the bow while you\u2019re playing or you could damage the hair.",
        "The bow will vibrate the string and play an A note.",
        "Once you reach the end of your bow, move your hand back up to keep playing the note.",
        "The note will continue playing as long as you move the bow across the string.",
        "Use shorter strokes to play notes faster and long strokes to play notes slower.",
        "Try playing the other strings.",
        "Lift the bow up and set it on the string you want to play.",
        "Make sure the bow is only touching 1 string at a time.",
        "Otherwise, lift your arm to adjust the angle of your bow.",
        "Practice long back and forth strokes with your bow followed by shorter notes.",
        "Work your way across the strings until you\u2019ve tried them all.",
        "Once you\u2019ve played all of the strings, switch the string you\u2019re playing on with every stroke.",
        "For example, play A, D, G, and C in 4 strokes.",
        "Press down on the strings with the tips of your fingers to change notes.",
        "Once you\u2019ve practiced playing the open strings, use the tips of your finger to hold down a string around the neck.",
        "Keep your fingers curled while you hold down the string.",
        "When you play the string, the note will be higher pitched than what the string normally is.",
        "Experiment with each string to hear what notes you can play on your instrument.",
        "The position of each note varies for each person since your finger shape will affect the notes you play.",
        "Don\u2019t press the string down with your nail or pad of your finger since you won\u2019t get as clear of a sound.Tip: Purchase fingering tape when you\u2019re starting off to label where specific notes are played along your strings.",
        "Using Advanced Techniques Tune the strings with the fine tuning pegs.",
        "From left to right, the strings are C, G, D, and A, with C being the thickest.",
        "Tune along to another instrument that\u2019s in key or use a digital tuner.",
        "Set the tuner to C and lightly pluck the C string with your finger.",
        "Locate the fine tuning pegs near the bottom of strings.",
        "Rotate the fine tuning pegs counterclockwise to go down in pitch or clockwise to go up until your string matches the tuner.",
        "Continue tuning the other strings to G, D, and A respectively.",
        "If the string doesn\u2019t sound close to the tuner\u2019s pitch right away, use the pegs at the top of the viola\u2019s neck to adjust the strings.",
        "Wiggle your finger on the neck to give the note slight variations.",
        "Press down on a string with your finger so you\u2019re pointing toward your body.",
        "Keep your finger completely curled while holding onto the string.",
        "Wiggle your finger forward and backward without moving it along the string.",
        "Pull your bow across the string so you can hear the pitch change while your finger moves.",
        "This technique is called vibrato.Tip: If you find it hard to wiggle your finger, start by moving your arm forward and back first.",
        "When you start feeling comfortable, move your wrist back and forth.",
        "Then, use just your fingers.",
        "Pluck the strings with your right index finger for shorter staccato notes.",
        "Set your bow aside while you\u2019re plucking.",
        "Place the pad of the index finger on your right hand against the string.",
        "Pluck the string by pulling the pad of your finger across it.",
        "The note will be short and sharp.",
        "Many pieces have plucking sections in between parts where you use your bow.",
        "Practice switching between using your bow and plucking to create a smooth transition.",
        "Bounce the bow on the strings to rapidly play short notes.",
        "Instead of pulling the bow across the string in a single movement, let the bow gently bounce off them.",
        "Use the middle of your bow since it\u2019s the bounciest area.",
        "Once your bow hits the string, lift it off immediately.",
        "The note played will feel short and energetic.",
        "This technique is known as spiccato.",
        "You can bounce on the string multiple times to play notes close together.",
        "Practice scales.",
        "Start by playing your C string without pressing down on it.",
        "The C is your starting note for the scale.",
        "Press down on the C string with your index finger near the top of the neck to create the next note.",
        "Use a tuner to ensure you\u2019re playing the next note in the scale, which is D. Use your tuner to find the next 3 notes, E, F, and G, and play them with your middle finger, ring finger, and pinky.",
        "To finish your scale switch to the G string and use your tuner to find  A, B, and high C.\nYou can find a fingering chart for the notes on your viola here: https://www.violaonline.com/violafingeringchart.htm.",
        "The notes will slightly vary in location since the size of your fingers affects the pitch."
