If kept in a freezer compartment of a refrigerator, breast milk is only good for 2 weeks. Place the container of breast milk near the front of the refrigerator as you thaw it.

The water should be just slightly cooler than room temperature. Using cool water for this initial stage is recommended because it brings the temperature of the breast milk up more gradually. If you immediately jumped to hot water, you could cause hot spots to form along the outside while the inside remained frozen. Moreover, you could also accidentally destroy more of the valuable enzymes contained in the breast milk. Only use cool water until you feel that the breast milk has thawed. Looking into the container, you should only see liquid and no floating chunks of frozen breast milk. Gently shake the container to feel for hidden chunks of frozen milk.

If it's in a bottle, submerge it in a pan of boiling water until it's very warm. However, don't put the milk in the microwave or directly into a pan, because you can get it too hot and burn the baby's tongue.\""

        "If you are warming breast milk straight from a frozen state, begin by holding the container of frozen breast milk under cool running water.",
        "The water should be just slightly cooler than room temperature.",
        "Using cool water for this initial stage is recommended because it brings the temperature of the breast milk up more gradually.",
        "If you immediately jumped to hot water, you could cause hot spots to form along the outside while the inside remained frozen.",
        "Moreover, you could also accidentally destroy more of the valuable enzymes contained in the breast milk.",
        "Only use cool water until you feel that the breast milk has thawed.",
        "Looking into the container, you should only see liquid and no floating chunks of frozen breast milk.",

        "Rebecca Nguyen, MA\t\t\tLactation Consultant & Owner, Family Picnic\t\t\t\tThere are a variety of ways to gently warm your milk.",
        "Lactation consultant Rebecca Nguyen says: \"You can use a warmer to get the milk to exactly 98.6\u00b0, but if you've frozen your milk in a freezer bag, you can also just hold  it under very warm water for 30 seconds to 1 minute until you can feel how warm it is.",
        "If it's in a bottle, submerge it in a pan of boiling water until it's very warm.",
        "However, don't put the milk in the microwave or directly into a pan, because you can get it too hot and burn the baby's tongue.\"",
        "Gradually increase the temperature of the water.",
        "Slowly increase the temperature of the running water after the milk is thawed.",
        "Increase the water from cool to room temperature, from room temperature to warm, and from warm to hot.",
        "Bringing the temperature up slowly destroys fewer enzymes in the milk and heats it more evenly.",
        "Stop before the water begins to steam.",
        "You do not want to make the breast milk so hot that it burns your baby's sensitive mouth.",
        "Note that chilled breast milk is perfectly safe for your baby to drink, but if you have a fussy eater, you may need to warm it to room temperature to make it seem more appetizing.",
        "Warm chilled breast milk under warm water.",
        "If you thawed the milk in the refrigerator or only had it stored in the refrigerator to start with, skip the cool water stage and place the container of breast milk directly under warm running water.",
        "Gradually increase the temperature of the water from warm to hot, stopping before the water begins to steam.",
        "Swirl the milk around.",
        "Make sure that the breast milk is evenly warmed by gently swirling the container or bottle, thereby swirling the milk around.",
        "You could also even out the temperature by stirring the breast milk with a spoon or coffee stirrer.",
        "EXPERT TIP\t\"Breastmilk separates in the fridge, but you can swirl it gently to mix it.",
