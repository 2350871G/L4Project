    "text": " Crafting the Minnie Mouse Ears Fold a sheet of black adhesive foam to make the ears. Remove the adhesive paper sheet to reveal the sticky side of the foam. Tuck the foam in half so that the shorter ends are touching. This will make the foam thicker when you create the ears. Trace 2 circles onto the black foam with a white colored pencil. Place a round object (i.e, a roll of ribbon) on the folded black foam and draw around it with white colored pencil to make the circle. Depending on how large you want the ears to be, these circles can be either as small as an orange or as large as a grapefruit. A white crayon works too, as long as you can see the circle marking on the foam. Cut the black circles out of the foam. Use a pair of sharp scissors to remove the traced circles from the foam. Then, trim the edges of the circles so that they are smooth all around. Use hot glue to attach the black circles to the headband. Take a hot glue gun and spread glue on the bottom of the circles. Use a coin-sized amount to attach each foam ear. The ears should be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart. Add more glue as necessary. Creating the Minnie Mouse Bow Cut the first piece of ribbon to be 9 inches (23 cm) long. This ribbon should be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide, since it will be forming the base of the bow. Measure the ribbon out with a ruler, and use scissors to cut the ribbon to the specified length. Snip the second piece of ribbon so it\u2019s 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) long.

Connect the smaller ribbon to the headband by wrapping it around the top  and over the bow. Glue the loose end down to the inside of the headband. Assembling the Outfit Make a red tutu or skirt to serve as the base of the dress. Use 1\u20132 yards (0.91\u20131.83 m) of red tulle fabric or regular woven fabric (i.e, cotton, linen) to make a red skirt. If you don\u2019t want to make the skirt yourself, you can purchase one in a department store or online. Ideally, the skirt should reach your knees.

Lay the skirt vertically on a flat surface so that all of the fabric is visible. Distribute the circles evenly to imitate a polka dot pattern on the skirt. Secure the circles one at a time by dabbing a circle of hot glue along the edge before pressing them onto the skirt. Draw 3 black lines on the back of the white gloves to imitate Minnie Mouse. Take a pair of wrist-length white gloves and lay them palm side down onto the table. Take a permanent marker or fabric marker and draw 3 straight lines along the back of the glove to imitate Minnie\u2019s cartoon qualities. Purchase black leggings and yellow shoes to mimic Minnie\u2019s traditional look. Minnie Mouse traditionally wears yellow heels with her red polka dot dress, and black leggings work to mimic her dark fur. Look for a short heel that has a closed toe. If you don\u2019t want to wear high heeled shoes, consider looking into a pair of flats. Applying Decorative Makeup Apply a light eyeshadow along with a dark eyeliner. Make your eyes look brighter by applying a light coating of gray or cream-colored eyeshadow over the lid. To emphasize your eyes, trace your upper lid with black eyeliner. While defining your eyes is a good idea for this look, less makeup is actually more suitable for the costume than more. Eyeliner helps to mimic the look of cartoon eyelashes.
