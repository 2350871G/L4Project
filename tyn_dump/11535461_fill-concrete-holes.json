Also, try to flatten out the bottom of the hole to create a stable, level surface for the new patching material. Since a thicker patch is more likely to last a long time, try to make the hole up to 1 in (2.5 cm) deep if it isn\u2019t already deeper than that. If the hole is already greater than 1 in (2.5 cm) deep, don\u2019t try to make it deeper. Instead, clean it out and choose an appropriate patching compound. If possible, make the bottom part of the hole slightly wider than the top part. You can do this by holding the chisel diagonally to chip away at the bottom edges of the hole. Making the bottom part a little bigger helps lock the patch into the existing concrete. You could also use a circular saw with a masonry bit to cut out damaged concrete."

        "Wait for any standing water to completely evaporate before attempting to patch the hole.",
        "This may take 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the weather and how much water is left.",
        "Any water left over will weaken the concrete patch as much as loose debris would.",
        "Give it plenty of time to dry!",
        "Spray the hole with water if it\u2019s more than 1 in (2.5 cm) deep.",
        "Removing the debris from a large hole is often a little challenging.",
        "In most cases, you can use a brush or vacuum to get most of the debris.",
        "If that isn\u2019t an option, fill the hole with water.",
        "Spray it down with a hose or pour water into it until it overflows, flushing out the debris.",
        "Remember to widen the hole by removing loose concrete first.",
        "Most of the time, this will allow you to brush or vacuum out the debris.",
        "Keep washing out the hole until you\u2019re sure it looks clean.",
        "Watch for the water to stay clear without any debris in it.",
        "Then, soak up as much water as possible and let the hole air dry.",
        "Mixing and Spreading Patching Material Fill holes with a mortar mix instead of regular concrete.",
        "When you shop for store-bought concrete, you will see a variety of different options.",
        "New concrete can\u2019t bond properly with the old concrete, so you will have to get something specifically meant for repairs.",
        "Select a mortar mix with sand for a hole less than 1 in (2.5 cm) deep and a mix with gravel for a hole deeper than that.",
        "The mortar mix often comes in 60 lb (27 kg) bags, which make about \u20443 cu ft (0.0094 m) of concrete.",
        "A 60 lb (27 kg) bag fills a hole about 1 ft (0.30 m) long, 3 ft (0.91 m) wide, and 2 in (5.1 cm) deep.",
        "Unless you\u2019re doing many repairs, a single bag will most likely be enough.",
        "If you\u2019re attempting to make your own mortar, combine 1 part Portland cement, 3 parts masonry sand or gravel, and water.",
        "Brush a bonding agent onto the concrete.",
        "A bonding agent is a liquid that helps join new and old concrete.",
        "Put on work gloves if you haven't already.",
        "Dip a paintbrush in and spread it throughout the hole.",
        "Coat the bottom and sides of the hole with an even, consistent layer.",
        "Note that the bonding agent can often be added after you have poured the concrete into the hole.",
        "Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for more information.",
        "You may also be able to mix the bonding agent in with the concrete.",
        "This is usually done by replacing 50% to 80% of the water with the bonding agent.",
        "If you don\u2019t apply the bonding agent now, lightly dampen the concrete with a moist sponge.",
        "Make sure there isn\u2019t any standing water in the hole.",
        "Pour the mortar mix into a bucket filled with water.",
        "Add the water to the mixing bucket first to reduce the amount of dust released when you drop in the mortar.",
        "Generally, use about 10  fl oz (300 mL) of lukewarm water for every 5 lb (2.3 kg) of mortar mix you plan on using.",
        "If you use too much water, the mortar will be too soupy and won\u2019t set properly.",
        "Err on the side of caution when mixing the mortar.",
        "You can always add more water, but you can\u2019t remove it.",
        "The only way to deal with a runny mix is to add more mortar.",
        "Remember to check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations on how much water to add.",
        "Factor in the liquid bonding agent if you plan on adding any to the mix.",
        "Mix the mortar for 3 to 5 minutes until it forms a thick putty.",
        "Stir the mortar around in the bucket with a hoe or another tool.",
        "You can also use a paddle attachment, which is a metal mixing rod that plugs into the end of a power drill.",
        "Continue mixing the mortar while checking its consistency.",
        "It is ready for use once it reaches the consistency of a thick, spreadable peanut butter.",
        "Make adjustments to get the mortar to the proper consistency.",
        "Add water gradually to thin it out, mixing it for a minute after each addition to check its consistency again.",
        "Layer mortar in the hole with a trowel.",
        "You can use a putty knife to spread the mixture over a small hole.",
        "Work the mixture into the hole with the tip of the tool.",
        "Cover the sides of the hole first, then begin filling the center of the hole.",
        "Try spreading the mortar about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick each time.",
        "If you wait for each layer to dry before adding the next one, you can create a stronger patch.",
        "Layering mortar is only really useful if you\u2019re working with a deep hole, such as one more than 1 in (2.5 cm) deep.",
        "If you\u2019re fixing a shallow hole, you might as well finish it in one go.",
        "Keep the patching material roughly level with the surrounding concrete.",
        "Adding more than you need is okay.",
        "You will have a chance to eliminate the excess before it dries.",
        "Patching a vertical surface, such as a wall, is pretty much the same as patching a hole on the ground.",
        "Push the mortar deep into the hole at first, then add more layer by layer.",
        "It will stay in place.",
        "Finishing and Curing Patches Drag a board over the hole to remove excess mortar.",
        "Select a board that is at least 1 ft (0.30 m) longer than the hole.",
        "Lay it across the hole on one side.",
        "Then, drag it over the hole.",
        "While dragging it, move it back and forth in a sawing motion to flatten the patch.",
        "The board will collect excess mortar so you can smooth out the patch and keep it level with the surrounding concrete.",
        "For vertical surfaces, try dragging a board down over the hole and then going back over the patch with a trowel.",
        "If you can\u2019t use a board, just use a trowel or float instead.",
        "Smooth out the remaining mortar with a trowel or float.",
        "If you have a float, which is a flat-bottomed tool designed for smoothing concrete, try using it on the mortar.",
        "Move the tool back and forth across the mortar a few times.",
        "After a few passes, the mortar patch will look flat and blend in well with the surrounding concrete.",
        "Make sure the patch is level with the concrete around it.",
        "Use a wood board to remove any excess before smoothing the mortar out and letting it harden.",
        "Cover the patch with a plastic sheet to protect it from damage.",
        "The patch will be pretty vulnerable until it has had a chance to cure.",
        "Purchase a concrete insulation barrier, spread it out across the patch, and pin it in place.",
        "Weight it down with heavy objects like bricks.",
        "If you\u2019re fixing a wall, use a waterproof tape to keep the sheet flat against the concrete.",
        "Keep other people away from the concrete until it has had a chance to cure.",
        "Don\u2019t let anyone walk or drive over it, for instance.",
        "Wait at least 6 hours, then mist the patch with lukewarm water.",
        "Quick-drying patching material usually takes about 4 to 6 hours to solidify.",
        "After it has become hard to the touch, lift up the plastic sheet.",
        "Use a spray bottle or a hose to lightly dampen the concrete with lukewarm water.",
        "Adding the water causes the concrete to continue curing, making the patch even stronger.",
        "The drying time can vary depending on the weather and product used, so check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations before misting.",
        "Continue misting the concrete twice a day for at least 7 days while it dries.",
        "Many quick-drying compounds may cure at a faster rate, so consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for more information.",
        "Set aside a certain time each morning and evening so you won\u2019t forget to mist the patching material as it sets.",
        "Spray it each time with a light amount of lukewarm water.",
        "The patch continues to grow stronger as it cures.",
        "Some products may require you to keep the patch covered for up to 28 days while misting each day.",
        "Even though this may seem like a long time, it is worth doing if the manufacturer recommends it.",
        "Once the concrete has finished curing, remove the plastic sheet and test it out.",
        "It should be level with the surrounding concrete and feel hard to the touch."
