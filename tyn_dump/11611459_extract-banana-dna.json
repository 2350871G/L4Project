        "During the 8 minutes, watch the glass for bubbles and movement.",
        "As mentioned, the DNA molecules are currently dissolved in the banana/soap/salt-water mixture.",
        "The combination of alcohol and salt causes those DNA molecules to precipitate or develop into a solid.",
        "We put the alcohol in the freezer because the lower temperatures allow more DNA molecules to form.",
        "You can leave the glass for longer than 8 minutes.",
        "The longer you leave it, the more defined the DNA material will become.",
        "Keeping the DNA Create a scientific storage environment with a small bottle.",
        "Find a small, clear glass bottle to use for longer-term storage.",
        "You can use a brand new bottle or reuse an old bottle (such as one previously used for spices).",
        "If you\u2019ve decided to reuse an old bottle, make sure it\u2019s completely clean inside and that the label has been removed.",
        "Fill the bottle with isopropyl alcohol.",
        "A dollar store is a great place to find a variety of small glass containers that may work for this purpose.",
        "The isopropyl alcohol doesn\u2019t have to be cold for this step.",
        "Dip the wood skewer into the glass and stir it slowly.",
        "Stick the wood skewer into the tall, narrow glass until the tip of the skewer is located where the isopropyl alcohol meets the banana/salt-water/soap mixture.",
        "Slowly turn or stir the wood skewer in this area and watch for bubbly, stringy pieces to move into the alcohol layer.",
        "Allow the DNA strands to wrap around the wood skewer.",
        "This step provides a great photo opportunity of the DNA.",
        "Move the banana\u2019s DNA into your newly created storage bottle.",
        "Slowly take the wood skewer\u2013with the DNA wrapped around it\u2013out of the tall, narrow glass.",
        "Place the wood skewer into the small bottle filled with isopropyl alcohol.",
        "Swirl the wood skewer a little bit to allow the DNA strand to move off the skewer and into the alcohol.",
        "Once the DNA is in the alcohol, secure the lid on the bottle and keep it as long as you\u2019d like."
