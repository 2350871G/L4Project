Keeping the lint trap clean ensures that your dryer is performing at peak efficiency, and could shave an extra few minutes off your total drying time. A pristine lint trap channels heat and air much more efficiently than one that\u2019s blocked up with debris. Get in the habit of emptying the lint trap after every 2-3 loads of laundry you run through the dryer. It's also a good idea to make sure the exhaust duct that carries hot air out of the dryer isn't blocked up.
