You can organise this list into toys, food, and litter tray supplies. A new kitten will want to play a lot so it's important that you provide plenty of toys for her. You don't have to buy expensive cat toys. Something as simple as a shoelace can be great fun for a kitten to play with. Before you buy food, you should speak to the breeder or the place you are adopting the kitten from. It's best to give her the same food to make her more at home and avoid a potential upset stomach. If you decide to change the food, do it gradually over about a week. Mix the two types of food together and progressively alter the ratio. Ensure you are providing food that is meant for kittens. Kittens use a lot of energy, so they need protein-rich kitten kibble until they are one year old. Get a litter tray that she can easily access, and place it somewhere quiet and easy to find."
