Forcing a child to do something before they're ready can mean they won't enjoy it as much later. Remember, each child is an individual, with their own interests and skill levels. If crocheting doesn\u2019t interest them right now, try to find another activity you can do together. They may become more interested in crochet later on."

                    "description": "It can be hard for younger children to work with delicate yarn and smaller needles. Use a large crochet hook, like a size N (10 mm), and thick yarn to start with. Once the child gets comfortable with those hooks, you can gradually reduce the needle size, if you want. Avoid using black yarn. It can be very difficult to see the knots in black yarn, making it hard for the children to see what you\u2019re doing, or whether they\u2019re following your instructions correctly.Did You Know? If you\u2019re working with very small children, you can skip the hooks altogether and teach hand-crocheting to start with. Just show them how to make the knots with their fingers, instead."

For example, you might want to start out by having a lesson where you make a simple chain. The next lesson, you might work on single crochet, then double crochet once they get the hang of that.
