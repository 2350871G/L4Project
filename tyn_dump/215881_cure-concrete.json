        "Some curing compounds come in a spray bottle, and others come in a bucket and have to be brushed on with a paint roller.",
        "Whichever type you have, apply an even coat of compound across the entire concrete surface.",
        "Don\u2019t forget about the sides and edges.",
        "Normal compound coats cover an area of 150\u2013200 sq ft (14\u201319 m) per 1 US gal (3.8 l), but always check the product for recommended coat thickness.",
        "Don\u2019t let the compound pool in any spots.",
        "Keep the sprayer or roller moving to spread it evenly.",
        "If you\u2019re using a spray applicator, stop to pump it as soon as the stream weakens to maintain even coverage.",
        "If you're using a sprayer, wear goggles to prevent any from getting in your eye.",
        "Don\u2019t press down hard with the roller.",
        "The concrete isn\u2019t strong enough to handle pressure yet.",
        "Leave the compound undisturbed for 7 days.",
        "After spraying the compound on, leave it to do its work.",
        "It seals the concrete and locks moisture in for the curing process.",
        "After 7 days, the curing process is usually complete.",
        "Different products may have different application times.",
        "Always follow the directions given on the product you use.",
        "Scrub the compound off if it doesn\u2019t disintegrate on its own.",
        "Some curing compounds don\u2019t disintegrate and need to be removed.",
        "Put on goggles and gloves to protect yourself.",
        "Then, use a steel-bristle brush to scrub off all the compound.",
        "Work across the entire concrete surface to remove everything.",
        "Then spray the concrete down with a hose to push off any remnants of the compound.",
        "Some steel-bristle brushes connect to buffing machines, making the job much easier.",
        "Buy or rent one with this feature to complete the job faster.",
        "Always double check the instructions on your compound packaging to confirm the correct removal method.",
        "Providing the Right Conditions Pour concrete when the temperature will be above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) for at least 7 days.",
        "Concrete cures best in temperatures above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C), so check the forecast for the next week.",
        "If you can expect warm temperatures, then now is the right time to pour the concrete.",
        "Pouring in the spring or summer is ideal to avoid any unexpected cold weather.",
        "If there is a sudden cold snap after pouring the concrete, professionals usually protect the concrete by building a structure around the site and using a portable heater.",
        "This is an expensive option, but it\u2019s the best choice to protect the concrete.",
        "Wait 24 hours to walk on the concrete.",
        "While the concrete is curing, it can\u2019t handle excessive weight.",
        "Let it dry for a full 24 hours before stepping on it to prevent damage to the surface.",
        "If you\u2019re water-curing the concrete, take extra care to avoid stepping on it while you re-wet the fabric.",
        "If the concrete is in an area with a lot of foot traffic, block the area off and hang signs warning about wet cement.",
        "Make sure any pedestrians will know they can't step on the area.",
        "Drive on the concrete only after 10 days have passed.",
        "Even if the concrete looks dry, it can't handle excessive weight until after it cures completely.",
        "If the concrete is in your driveway or a similar area that cars drive on, wait at least 10 days before driving or parking your car on it.",
        "If you have a large vehicle like an RV or truck, wait 28 days before parking it on the concrete.",
        "Also wait 28 days if this is a commercial area with a lot of vehicle traffic, like a parking lot.",
        "The weight from multiple vehicles can cause the concrete to sink.",
        "Let the concrete harden for a full month before painting or staining it.",
        "Introducing new chemicals to the concrete before it\u2019s completely hardened can interfere with the curing process.",
        "Wait a full month before applying any paints or stains to the concrete.",
        "If you do want to paint the concrete and used a curing compound, remember to get one that is nonreactive with paint."
