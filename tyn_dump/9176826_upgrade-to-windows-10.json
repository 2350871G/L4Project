In case an error occurs throughout the upgrade process, retain a copy of any important data that's on the computer. Fancy paid backup software or paying for an expensive cloud storage service isn't required. Copying your files and folders to an external hard drive is sufficient. Having a backup plan set before you upgrade will eliminate stress if you do happen to lose any data, as you'll be able to restore from your backup\u2014thus, not really losing anything important at all. Never store the backup on the same computer you're upgrading. This could spell bad news if the entire hard drive crashed or was formatted (erased)."
