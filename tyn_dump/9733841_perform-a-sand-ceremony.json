Some options include a heart-shaped vase, cylinder jar, corked bottle, or decanter. Base your decision off of you and your spouse\u2019s tastes. Choose a stopper, like a cork or a lid, if you want to seal it. Consider a vase that is decorative and attractive, so you can show it off in your home after your wedding. Make sure your vase is transparent, so you can see the sand! A popular, but pricey, option is to purchase a custom-made, laser-etched photo frame. These photo frames are designed so that you can see an image once the sand is poured."
