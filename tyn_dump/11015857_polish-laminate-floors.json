Use a broom to sweep the entire laminate floor until there is no trace of dust or dirt. If you don\u2019t have a broom, use a brush pan and sweeper instead. If the floor is muddy or grimy, use a mop to clean it before you sweep. If you like, you can mop with your own all-natural cleanser made of equal parts water, vinegar, and rubbing alcohol. Just make sure to wipe your floor clean and let it dry completely before applying the polish."

If you don\u2019t have a polishing cloth, use a microfiber cloth instead, as this will achieve a similar result. If your mop has a polishing attachment, use this instead of a polishing cloth.
