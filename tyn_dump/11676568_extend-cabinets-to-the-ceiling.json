Any molding will be in the way of your new cubby. Take a prybar or teeth of a hammer and tuck it between the molding and cabinets, if there is any. Work around the cabinets and pull off all the trim. If you can\u2019t get the prybar behind the trim, tap it with a hammer a few times first. Measure the length, depth, and height of the space above the cabinets. Use a tape measure and check the distance between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling. Then, measure the length of each cabinet section. Finally, check the depth of the cabinets, meaning the distance from the front of the cabinets to the wall. Remember these measurements so you cut the wood correctly. If the cabinets are not straight for the entire length, then measure each straight piece individually. You\u2019ll need separate cubbies for each section. Remember to measure all the cabinets in the kitchen, especially if you have them on separate walls. The measurements could be slightly different. Cut 2 plywood boards to the length and depth of the space above the cabinets. These 2 pieces form the top and bottom for the cubby. Mark straight lines on each piece of plywood matching the length of the cabinets and the space between the front of the cabinets and the wall. Then, use a power saw to cut along those lines. Make sure each of these pieces is equal. Wear gloves and goggles when operating a power drill. Keep your hands at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from the blade while it\u2019s spinning. This step makes a cubby for each straight cabinet section. If you have multiple cabinet sections, then repeat this step to make multiple cubby pieces matching the measurements of each section. Mark the spaces on the base for cubby dividers. The space between the cubby dividers depends on how much storage room you want. Make each section at least 12 inches (30 cm) for storage. Start at one end of the base and measure in 12 inches (30 cm), then draw a straight line. Continue down until you\u2019ve filled all the space on the board. Adjust your measurements to the size of the board. Divide the amount of sections you want by the length of the board to get the size for each section. Uniform cubby sections are best for decorations. However, you can also make the spaces different sizes for a different effect. Cut the cubby dividers 1 inch (2.5 cm) shorter than the space above the cabinet. Since standard plywood boards are \u20442 in (1.3 cm) and you\u2019re using 2 of them for the cubby top and bottom, add these 2 measurements together so the cubbies fit above the cabinets. Subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the space above the cabinets and mark that measurement on more plywood boards. Cut as many boards as you need to fill the cubby according to these measurements. If there is 10 inches (25 cm) of space above the cabinets, then cut the dividers 9 inches (23 cm) tall for the correct fit. Cut the dividers according to the thickness of the plywood. If the boards are a different thickness than \u20442 in (1.3 cm), then adjust your measurements accordingly so the cubby fits above the cabinet. Attach the dividers onto the cubby base with wood glue. Apply a line of wood glue at both ends of the base and on each line you drew for the cubby dividers. Then press a divider onto each line of glue and press down so the glue adheres. Glue the top of the cubby onto the dividers. Apply a line of wood glue onto the top of each divider. Then take the top of the cubby and press it down so it adheres to the glue. Let the whole cubby dry for 24 hours before installing it. For a stronger hold, drive nails into the dividers from the top and bottom of the cubby. Lift the cubby onto the cabinets. Slide the piece into position above the cabinets. Adjust it so it\u2019s flush with the front and sides of the cabinets. You\u2019ll probably need a partner to help lift and position the cubbies. If the cubby doesn\u2019t slide in easily, give it a few taps from the front with a rubber mallet. This should drive it into place. Install molding along the cubby top and ceiling. The molding will cover any gaps or spaces. Measure the length of the cubby and cut the mold to the correct size. Apply a line of wood glue to the molding and press it into the spot where the cubby meets the ceiling. Finish the job by driving finishing nails into the molding. You can also attach molding along where the cabinets meet the cubby. This may blend the installation better. For more security, you can drive nails through the cubbies and into the wall studs. If your cabinets are properly secured, however, they shouldn\u2019t have any trouble supporting this extra weight. Paint the cubby and cabinets the same color. A fresh coat of paint will blend the installation and make the cubbies and cabinets look like one solid piece. Choose a color you like and paint the cabinets and cubbies. Add a second coat in 24 hours. Then enjoy the new storage space you have above your cabinets. For a more decorative option, you can paint the molding and cabinets a different color. If you choose, you can also install doors on the cubbies. This is a more complicated project, but could add a new layer of decoration. Installing Doors on the Cubbies Measure the opening in each cubbyhole and add \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) to the measurements. Take your tape measure and measure the length and height of each cubbyhole. Then add \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) to each measurement so your doors cover the entire hole. If all the cubbyholes are uniform, then you don't have to measure each one individually. But measure a few to check for consistency. If you used a thicker type of plywood, you can increase the amount you add. Buy pre-made cubby doors if you don't want to make your own. You have a choice between making your own doors or buying them already made. For pre-made ones, check the hardware store for doors that match the measurements you took. Buy as many as you need to cover all the cubbies. If no doors are the right size, see if the store will custom-make them for you. Pre-made doors come in a variety of designs. Pick one that matches the molding designs, or another type that appeals to you. Cut plywood boards to cover the cubbies if you make your own doors. Use the measurements you took and draw lines on plywood board to the correct dimensions. Then, use a power saw to cut out each door. Cut as many doors as you need to cover each cubbyhole. If you have woodworking skills, you can cut designs into these boards so they don't look plain. Otherwise, they'll do the job fine if they're solid. Remember to wear gloves and goggles when using a power saw. Screw hinges and knobs onto each door. Place the hinges 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top and bottom of the door on the right side. Use a pencil and mark the screw holes through the hinge openings. Then take a drill and make a hole on each marker. Place the hinge back over the holes and screw them down. For the handle, drill a hole through the lower right corner of each door on the opposite side from the hinges. Hold the knob over the hole and insert a screw from the back. Repeat this process for each door. Hardware kits with hinges and knobs are available at hardware stores. With this configuration, the doors will open to the left. If you prefer them to open to the right, screw the hardware onto the other side. The doors will all open the same direction as well. If you want doors that open in the opposite direction next to each other, make an equal number of doors with the hinges on the left and right. Attach the doors to each cubby with screws. Hold the door up so it covers the cubbyhole. Align it so it overlaps the cubby evenly on all sides. Then drill screws through all the holes on the hinge to attach the door. If the doors open from different sides, alternate their placement. Put one that opens left down first, then one that opens right next to it, then continue in that pattern. Paint the doors to match the cabinets. Blend the doors to the cubby and cabinets with a thorough paint job. Find a color that matches the cubbies and cabinets. Sand each door and apply a coat of primer. Then apply the paint and let it dry for 24 hours. Add a second coat to complete the job. You could also paint the doors a different color from the rest of the cabinets for a decorative effect. Make sure the colors complement each other. For example, use a navy blue for the cabinets and cubbies and baby blue for the doors.",
