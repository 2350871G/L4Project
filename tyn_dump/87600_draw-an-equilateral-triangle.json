Make sure that you have plenty of room to draw all three sides! Span the segment with your compass. Slide a pencil into your compass, and make sure that it's sharp! Put the point of your compass at one end of the segment, and set the pencil point at the other. Trace a quarter-circle arc. Do not adjust the point of the compass, and do not change the set \"width\" of the tool from the compass point to the pencil point. Swing the pencil-point of the compass in a quarter-circle up and away from the line segment. Switch the compass around. Without changing the width of the compass spread, move the point of the compass to the other end. Draw a second arc. Carefully swing the pencil-point of the compass so that the new arc crosses over the first arc that you drew. Mark the point where the two arcs cross. This is the apex (the \"top\" point) of your triangle. It should lie at the exact center of the line segment that you've drawn. You can now draw two straight lines leading to this point: one from each end of the \"bottom\" line segment. Finish the triangle. Use a ruler to draw two more straight line segments: the remaining sides of the triangle. Connect each end of the original line segment to the point at which the arcs cross. Make sure that the lines are straight. To finish the job, erase the arcs that you drew so that only the triangle remains! Consider tracing this triangle onto another page. This way, you can start fresh with a clean shape. If you need a bigger or a smaller triangle, repeat the process but adjust the length of the original line segment.

For accuracy, make sure that the line cleaves through the exact center of the circle. Use your pencil to trace an arc: roughly one-quarter of the way around the perimeter of the circle. Trace another arc. Now, shift the circular object so that the edge touches the other end of the line segment. Make sure that the line segment runs through the exact center of the circle. Draw another quarter-arc that crosses the first arc at a point directly above the line segment. This point is the apex of your triangle. Complete the triangle. Draw the remaining sides of the triangle: two more straight lines will connect the apex with the two open ends of the line segment. Now, you should have a perfectly equilateral triangle! Using a Protractor Draw the first side. Use a ruler or the straight edge of your protractor to trace a straight line segment of an appropriate length. This line segment will become the first side of your triangle, and each of the other sides will be just as long \u2013 so make sure that it's the right size! Use a protractor to measure a 60\u00b0 angle at one end.  Trace the second side. Measure out a new line segment that is equal in length to the first. Start it at one end of the original line segment, where you measured the 60\u00b0 angle. Start from the vertex (the point) of the angle, and trace the straight edge of the protractor until you reach the next \"point.\" Finish the triangle. Use the straight edge of your protractor to trace out the final side of the triangle. Connect the point at the end of the second line segment to the unattached end of the first line segment. You should now have an equilateral triangle.",
