However, you need to ensure that the rain barrel uses a diverter or has an overflow to get rid of water pooling at your home's foundation. If it's possible, extend the downspout piping to a location for the barrel that is a few feet away from the house to avoid overflow saturating the foundation. A full rain barrel can weigh more than 400 pounds, so make sure you don't place it on anything that can't take this weight, or where it might do damage if knocked over. Keep the barrel as low as possible for more stability, placing it on a wide, solid base. Secure ratchet strap(s) around the barrel and anchor them firmly to either the house or two ground anchors, placing the straps in an 'X'. Tightly pull the straps downward to add stability. Posts could also be placed into the ground to serve as a backstop and anchor for the barrel."
