Have a clean, dry paper towel easily accessible to prevent contamination of sterile hands. Wash your hands with soap and lukewarm water for 30 seconds. Dirty hands may increase the likelihood of infecting your wound. To wash your hands thoroughly, scrub between your fingers, underneath your fingernails, and up past your wrists. If visible debris remains, rewash hands."

With clean hands, place clean gauze to cover the entire wound. Make sure to maintain pressure to the wound, if still bleeding, to decrease blood flow and encourage blood clotting. Only use a moderate amount of pressure, because too much pressure may cause further damage. If wound continues to bleed for more than a few minutes, seek professional help. Skip this step if your wound is not bleeding."

This will wash away any debris or foreign contaminants that could may be present in the afflicted area. Rinse the area around the wound as well. Do not scrub the wound hard as this may damage more tissue or increase bleeding. Rinsing the wound with warm water will increase blood circulation and bleeding."
