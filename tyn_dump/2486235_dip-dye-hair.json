You will need to bleach the dark color from your hair so the colored dye will take later in the process. If you already have very light hair, or if you don't mind layering a color over your natural color, you can skip this step. Colored hair dyes sit on top of your natural hair color. For example, if you apply a pastel pink hair dye to very light blonde hair, it will show up pastel pink. However, it will be much more subtle and dark when layered on top of dark hair."
