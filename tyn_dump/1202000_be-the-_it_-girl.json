            "description": "This is absolutely crucial. You need to dress in a very stylish way - just like a model off vogue magazine or the Chanel runway. Try to wear as much designer brands as you can, such as Tod's, Tory Burch, Chloe, Max Mara, Michael Kors, DKNY, Max Azria, L.L.Bean, Ralph Lauren, Miss Me, True Religion and J Crew. Save the designers such as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci for when you're a little older, because this may lead to people thinking that your clothes are knockoffs. If you can't afford these brands, try going to high end high street shops and find clothes that are reasonably priced but look very couture. If you still can't afford these brands, go to places that have nice clothing that is in style and your style. Go to places like Forever 21 and Zara."

As for bags, the best brands are Fendi, Ferragamo, Michael Kors, Yves Saint Laurent and Louis Vuitton. However, try to be as subtle as possible. Ensure that you grow a fairly large Fine Jewelry Collection and get a nice display case for it to protect it from any damage. Keep away from *shudder* Cubic Zirconia!!

Make sure you get the best make up brands such as Chanel, Bobbi Brown, MAC, YSL and Dior because, after all, the It Girl deserves the best of the best (plus they are better for your skin compared to those cheap, toy make-up brands). Take care of your skin before applying make-up. Depending on how sensitive your skin is will also depend on how much make-up you are able to apply (before and after effects). If you are awful at doing make up, hire a professional make up artist instead. If you can't afford a professional, practice doing your make up and look up good tutorials on YouTube so you can get really good at it."
