Some species of stink bugs can fly and may escape if you do not manage to flick it off in one fell swoop. Stink bugs should drown within 20 to 40 seconds. The bugs breathe through pores beneath their waxy exterior shells, and when soap plugs these pores up, the bugs suffocate. You could also wear disposable gloves and pick up the stink bugs by hand. Similarly, you could pick them up with tweezers. Picking them up directly ensures that they will not be able to escape, but they may release their odor if you do not work quickly."

        "Strain the solution and mix in 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of dish detergent.",
        "Fill a spray bottle with this solution and thoroughly coat the stink bug with it.",
        "The liquid dish detergent allows the solution to stick to the insect more effectively, and the nicotine poisons the stink bug.",
        "Wear disposable gloves as you work with the nicotine solution to avoid accidentally absorbing the poison through your skin.",
        "Using Household Solutions Paralyze stink bugs with hairspray.",
        "Attack each stink bug with hairspray as you see it to stop the pest from moving around.",
        "The hairspray alone will not kill the stink bug, but it will immobilize it, preventing the bug from roaming about freely and making it easier to apply a chemical that will kill the bug.",
        "Make sure to use the stickiest hairspray possible.",
        "Thankfully, cheap brands are usually stickier than expensive brands.",
        "Kill the bugs with rubbing alcohol, bleach, or ammonia.",
        "Fill a glass jar halfway with one of these chemicals and knock or drop the stink bugs into the jar as you come across them.",

        "Combining these chemicals can produce fumes that are deadly to humans.",
        "Knock the stink bugs into the solution using a popsicle stick or gloved hand, or pick the bugs up with tweezers.",
        "You could also dilute one part rubbing alcohol with three parts water inside a spray bottle.",
        "Attack stink bugs with this solution as you see them.",
        "The alcohol will wear away at the exterior of the insect, drying it out and eventually destroying it.",
        "Kill the bug with wart remover.",
        "Buy a can of freeze away wart remover and spray it directly on the stink bug.",
        "The bug will freeze instantly and all you need to do is flush them down the toilet.",
        "Spray the stink bug with hot sauce.",
        "Fill a spray bottle with hot sauce or liquified hot peppers.",
        "Squirt each stink bug with the spicy insecticide as you see it.",
        "Hot peppers are capable of burning human skin and eyes if handled improperly.",

        "Wash your hands after handling hot peppers and hot sauce to avoid accidentally irritating your eyes.",
        "Drop candle wax remover on the stink bug.",
        "Place a single drop of candle wax remover on the back of an individual stink bug.",
        "The insect should die within one or two minutes.",
        "You might be able to apply the candle wax remover to the stink bug without capturing it, but be aware that accidentally getting the remover onto carpet or other surfaces may create a stain.",
        "For best results, immobilize the insect with hair spray or trap it inside a glass jar before applying the remover.",
        "The candle wax remover strips away the waxy coating on the outside of the stink bug's shell, thereby breaking down interior membranes.",
        "Use white vinegar.",
        "Place a tablespoonful / teaspoonful of white vinegar in a container; use a container that is not too large.",
        "Capture the stink bug using tweezers, an empty medicine container with cap, and/or use gloves.",
        "Put the bug or bugs into the vinegar.",
        "They die immediately without releasing their bomb.",
        "Flush the critters down the toilet.",
        "Using Physical Extermination Vacuum the stink bug up.",
        "When you see one or more stink bugs, suck them up using an upright vacuum with a bag.",
        "The stink bugs will release their odor inside the vacuum, causing the machine to stink for several weeks.",
        "Sprinkle the interior of the vacuum with a strong deodorizer to minimize this effect.",
        "Avoid using bagless vacuum cleaners.",
        "Use vacuums with bags and dispose of the bag after you finish sucking up the bugs.",
        "Alternatively, wrap a knee-high stocking around the outside of the vacuum tube and secure it in place with a rubber band.",
        "Stuff the rest of the stocking into the tube and suck the stink bugs up as usual.",
        "This will prevent the bugs from passing through the vacuum filter.",
        "Set up an insect electrocution system.",
        "Place a bug zapper in a dark attic or closet.",
        "Like most insects, stink bugs are drawn to sources of light.",
        "By placing the device in a dark room, the light of the electrocution system becomes more appealing to the stink bugs.",
        "As they approach the light, they are instantly electrocuted and die before they have the chance to release their stink.",
        "Make sure that you sweep up or vacuum up the dead stink bugs after several days pass.",
        "Lay out glue traps.",
        "Spread flypaper or other sticky traps near windows, doorways, vents, and cracks.",

        "Freeze the insects to death.",
        "Trap the stink bugs in a resealable plastic freezer bag or airtight, freezer-safe container.",
        "Place the container in a freezer for several days to kill them.",

        "Quickly pick up the glass.",
        "Sweep the dead bug into the garbage.",
