Likewise, the Mafia is replaced by the FBI and winning the game involves eliminating all the FBI agents. Folks that play these version of the game generally call the game \"Emma\" or \"Assata\" instead of \"Mafia\". Include extra roles for players to enliven the gameplay. Extra roles are optional, but they can make the game more complex and interesting. Have the moderator assign different cards to indicate additional roles they want to incorporate into the game. Some options you might try include:\nThe Informant, who gets to know who the mafia are without them knowing who they are. The Lawyer, who chooses someone to defend. The person who the lawyer defends cannot be voted out the following morning. The Peeping-Tom, who is allowed to open their eyes at any moment. This person may find out who plays each role in the game, but this makes them more likely to be killed by the mafia. The Grandma With a Shotgun. If the Grandma with a shotgun is visited by anyone during the night cycle, that person dies, but the Grandma cannot be killed. Cupid can make 2 players fall in love, which will put both of them at a higher risk of being eliminated. On the first night cupid picks 2 people to be the lovers. If 1 of the lovers dies, the other dies of a broken heart instantly. Create 2 competing groups of mafia for an extra-large group. For large groups of 20 or more players, it is often interesting to have 2 separate, competing groups of mafia and play the game with 2 night cycles. These 2 sets of mafia will be working to kill the townspeople and their rival mafia members. You can give them names like East Side and West Side Squad, or Blue and Red Team Mafia.Tip: The larger the group you have, the more roles you will want to include! This will make for a more complex game and give more players interesting roles and abilities to use.",

        "There should be 1 mafia member for every 3 townspeople, so include this amount of the special suit in the deck.",
        "For example, to play with 12 players, remove all but 1 king and 1 queen, all but 3 cards of a certain suit (or the number of mafia players needed), and include only 7 more random cards.",
        "You may assign any card they like to be the mafia card, such as hearts, clubs, or spades.Tip: The moderator can also hand pick the mafia members, detective, doctor, and townspeople by giving them certain cards, or by tapping them a certain number of times on the shoulder during the night cycle.",

        "If the mafia cannot come to a unanimous decision about who to eliminate, then they forfeit their turn and no one will be eliminated during that round.Tip: If you want to make the game a little more kid-friendly, make the game about stealing a cookie jar each night instead of killing someone.",
        "Tell the mafia to go back to sleep after they choose their victim.",
        "Note who the person is that the mafia has chosen to eliminate.",
        "Then, tell the mafia to go back to sleep and have all of them close their eyes again.",

        "Silently indicate if the person the detective identified is a member of the mafia, such as by nodding or shaking your head.",

        "Wake up the doctor and let them choose someone to save.",
        "The doctor can point at someone to save or save themselves.",
        "If the person the doctor saves is the same person the mafia chose, they will survive this round and not be eliminated.",
        "Otherwise, nothing will happen to the person saved and the person the mafia chose will be eliminated.",
        "If a mafia member opens their eyes when they are not supposed to and sees the detective or doctor, then you may choose to eliminate them on a technicality.",

        "You can add details to your story or keep it short and simple.",
        "For example, you could say something like, \u201cThe mafia attacked John during the night, but the doctor was able to save them, so they will live.",
        "The detective was unable to catch any of the mafia members in the act.\u201d\nOr, you might say, \u201cThe mafia attacked and killed Maria last night.",

        "Set a timer for 5 minutes to ensure that the discussion doesn\u2019t get out of hand or go on too long.",
        "For example, players may say something along the lines of \u201cJoey hasn\u2019t said much, which seems pretty suspicious.\u201d Then, Joey might say something like, \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to say much because I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.",
        "However, if I was a guilty of something, then I might point fingers at other people.\u201dTip: You may set a longer time limit for the discussions if desired, such as 10 or 15 minutes.",

        "At this point, someone may make an accusation against another player stating that they think that the other person is part of the mafia.",
        "Once an accusation has been made, it must be seconded by another player to move into the defense phase.",
        "For example, someone might accuse another player by saying, \u201cI think Jennifer is in the mafia!\u201d If someone else seconds the accusation, then it goes forward to the defense phase.",
        "Explain the accusation and allow the accused to defend themselves.",
        "The accuser gets 30 seconds to explain why they think the person is in the mafia, but the person who is accused also gets 30 seconds to defend themselves.",
        "The accuser may draw on their observations or invent reasons why they think the person is guilty.",
        "The accused player may declare their innocence, invent fictional alibi, and use other tactics to prove their innocence.",
        "For instance, someone might accuse someone because they look guilty and they didn\u2019t have much to add to the discussion.",
        "The accused may also use fictional alibis and cite other aspects of their character as part of their defense.",
        "For example, the accused might say they are the doctor or detective, which no one would have any way of knowing for certain except the moderator.",
        "If the accused is lying (or if the accuser wants to convince others they are lying), then the accuser might claim they are the real doctor or detective.",

        "You can hold an anonymous vote by instructing everyone to close their eyes, or let everyone keep their eyes open.",
        "Everyone gets to vote, including the accused and the accuser.",
        "Start a new accusation round if the player is voted not guilty.",
        "If there is not a majority vote of guilty, the accusations begin again.",
