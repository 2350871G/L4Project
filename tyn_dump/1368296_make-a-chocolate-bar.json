If you want more interesting or varied shapes, look for silicone or chocolate molds available from homeware and cooking stores. Freeze your chocolate for 3 to 4 hours or until completely firm. Carefully transfer your chocolate molds to the freezer and leave for several hours or overnight. This will freeze the cocoa butter and solidify your mixture into chocolate bars. Remove the chocolate from the molds and store for up to 3 weeks. Once the chocolate is completely solid, remove the mold from the freezer and pop the chocolates out. Transfer to a plastic bag or container and store for up to 3 weeks. As cocoa butter has a melting point around 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F), it is best to store it in the refrigerator until you are ready to eat it. This will give you a similar snap to processed chocolate.

Milk and white chocolate need to be lowered to a temperature of 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F). Put the chocolate back over the pot to raise its temperature. Keep stirring with the thermometer as you raise the temperature of the chocolate slightly higher once again. Here are the temperatures for different chocolates:\nDark chocolate needs to be brought back up to a temperature of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F). Milk and white chocolate need to reach a temperature of 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F). Only use a low heat. If you raise the temperature too much over the one needed, you\u2019ll have to raise it back up to the initial temperature and repeat the process. Pour the chocolate into a silicon mold or rimmed baking tray. This will be the shape in which your final chocolate bar is set. Silicon molds can give you fun and interesting chocolate shapes, or you can use an edged baking tray to create a slab that can be cut up into smaller bars after it sets. Silicon molds and chocolate molds should be available from local homeware and cooking stores in a variety of shapes and sizes. If you notice any air bubbles in the chocolate as you transfer it, tap the tray or mold on your counter 2 or 3 times. This will pop the air bubbles and give your finished chocolate a smoother texture. Refrigerate the chocolate until it is set. Carefully transfer your tray of chocolate to the fridge, making sure not to spill any as you shift it. Leave it to chill for around 5 minutes or until the bars firm up. If you\u2019re using untempered chocolate, it may take longer for the bars to set up. Store the bars in a cool, dry place for up to a month. Tempered chocolate can be kept at around room temperature without melting for around a month. If you live in a warmer climate, it might be better to keep your bars in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to eat them. Untempered chocolate bars will need to be stored in the refrigerator in order to prevent them from melting. Flavoring Your Chocolate Bars Mix peanut butter into the melted chocolate for some subtle nuttiness. While the chocolate or chocolate mixture is still melting, stir in a few spoonfuls of peanut butter until the mixture is smooth again. This will add a delicious hint of peanut butter to your finished chocolate bars. Add some sea salt for a sweet and salty taste. Sprinkle a little finely ground sea salt over your chocolate bars immediately after pouring them into the molds. The salt will add a little more complexity to your bars, as well as enhancing the deliciously pure chocolate flavor. Mix in some toasted nuts for an extra crunch. In a dry frying pan, lightly toast some peanuts, almonds, coconut, or whatever other types of nut you like. Scatter them over the bottom of your chocolate molds before pouring in your chocolate for an extra nutty crunch when biting in your finished chocolate bars. Add some dried fruit to your chocolate for a tangy chew. Finely cut up a few chunks of your dried fruit of choice and place one or two pieces into each chocolate mold. This will help balance out the richness of your chocolate, as well as adding a freshness to cut through some of the sweetness. Apricots, cherries, cranberries, or figs would all be excellent additions to your chocolate bars. Make sure not to use anything with a high water content, as this can cause your chocolate to seize and become unworkable.",
