Your phone uses special technology to measure depth, and will automatically blur the backdrop. Portrait mode is especially helpful in places that have busy backgrounds, like a crowded beach or an amusement park. Some non-iPhones also have portrait mode, like the Galaxy Note 8 and the Google Pixel 2XL."

Larger lenses have  larger aperture, which means that they have an adjustable hole that can take in a larger amount of light. Because it\u2019s difficult for cameras to focus on a large amount of light at once, the resulting background appears blurrier. Digital SLR lenses are rated on an F-number scale.
