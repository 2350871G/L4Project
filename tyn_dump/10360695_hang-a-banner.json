Pull the banner tight so the opposite corner is at the same height before putting a push pin in it. Secure the bottom corners of the banner with 2 more push pins. If you\u2019re hanging a banner made of vinyl or heavier material, pin along the edges of the banner every 6 inches (15 cm) so it doesn\u2019t fall down. Push pins will leave small holes in your banner and wall once you remove them. Use a level to check if your banner is hanging crooked."

Put the hook on the suction cup through the grommet, or metal ring, in the top corner of your banner. Stretch the banner so it\u2019s level and taut before placing another suction cup in line with the other corner\u2019s grommet. Suction cups are a good alternative if you don\u2019t want to damage your walls, but they don\u2019t stick to every surface. Test a suction cup on your wall first to see if it stays. If you\u2019re working with a heavier banner, put at least 1 suction cup in the top center of the banner. Suction cup hangers can be purchased at any big box store."

Tying the Banner between Posts Set up or find 2 posts the same distance apart as the length of your banner. Measure the length and height of your banner so you know how far to set your posts. Look for areas between trees, pillars, or fences that are at least the same distance apart. If you need a banner in an open area, use L-shaped banner stands.

Use a hole punch large enough so the male end of the grommet, the one with the raised cylinder, can fit through it. Make the holes in the same place in each corner so the banner will hang straight. Many grommet installation kits will come with a hole punch attachment. Grommet installation kits can be purchased at your local crafts or hardware store. Feed the male end of the grommet through the front of the hole. Push the raised cylinder on the grommet through the hole you made. Make sure the cylinder is poking out through the back of your banner and the ring is on the front. Grommets prevent rips or tears in your banner when you feed a rope through the hole. Set the female end on the backside of the banner. Flip your banner over and place the ring over the male end\u2019s cylinder so the convex side faces up. Place a female end over each grommet you\u2019re installing. Use grommet pliers to snap the grommet in place. Hold the pliers so they line up with the grommet on the front and back of your banner. Squeeze the pliers together to secure the grommet in place. Repeat the process for each corner. The grommet pliers bend the edge of the cylinder to hold it tightly against the ring on the back.",
