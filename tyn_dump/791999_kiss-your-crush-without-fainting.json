This will exfoliate them, and leave them smooth. If you don't want to do that, exfoliate with sugar. To do this, put a pinch of sugar in the hand opposite of that one you write with (if right handed, put the sugar in your left), wet your writing hand's fingertips with warm water and wet your lips, let no more than 7 - 10 dips of water mix with the sugar, dab the mix onto your index finger of your writing hand, and scrub your lips gently in a clockwise circular motion. Do not do both methods, as it could harm your lips by giving small cuts, drying out your lips, or making then sore from rubbing too hard. After you exfoliate, use a moisturizing chap stick, such as Blistex Deep Renewal, or Burt's Beeswax lip balm. Fresh breath is always a plus. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9a\\/Kiss-Your-Crush-Without-Fainting-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Kiss-Your-Crush-Without-Fainting-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9a\\/Kiss-Your-Crush-Without-Fainting-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Kiss-Your-Crush-Without-Fainting-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
