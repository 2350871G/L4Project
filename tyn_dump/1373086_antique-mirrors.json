Latex gloves work best because they protect your hands while allowing you maximum dexterity. If you're allergic to latex and cannot use latex gloves, try using a pair of rubber gloves like you'd use to wash dishes. Many online retailers also sell nitrile and other types of gloves. You can purchase latex or rubber gloves at a hardware store or local supermarket."

Be careful when doing this so that you do not accidentally scratch the wooden frame. Once you've pried the staples out by about \u20448 in (3.2 mm), use a pair of pliers to pull the staples the rest of the way out of the frame. Then, simply lift the mirror out of the frame.
