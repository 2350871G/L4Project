        "If you find that your skimmer basket becomes full fairly easily, you may want to empty it more than once or twice a day.",
        "Use a flat skimmer net for isolated debris.",
        "While a skimmer basket works well to remove debris from the pool, it does take time for all of the dirt to circulate to the basket and it may miss some items.",
        "To get rid of small amounts of isolated debris, a flat skimmer net on a telescopic pole works well.",
        "Drag it across the water surface to lift out the items.",
        "Even with a skimmer basket attached, it\u2019s a good idea to skim your pool at least once a day.",
        "If your above ground pool doesn\u2019t have a skimmer basket, you should skim it manually at least three or four times a day.",
        "Remove heavy debris with a leaf rake.",
        "If there is a storm in your area or other event that results in a large number of leaves and other heavy debris in your above ground pool, use a leaf rake to remove them.",
        "It is a bag that attaches to a telescopic pool pole so you can easily pull it across the surface of the water and get rid of debris.",
        "A leaf bag is also handy for removing large debris from the bottom of the pool.",
        "Brushing the Pool Attach a brush head to a telescopic pole.",
        "In all above ground pools, there is usually at least one area that has little to no circulation from the filter.",
        "Those spots are a prime location for algae to grow, so it\u2019s important to brush your pool.",
        "Place a brush head on a telescopic pool pole for the job so it\u2019s easier to reach all of the wall surface.",
        "To avoid damaging your above ground pool\u2019s walls, use a brush with nylon bristles.",
        "Depending on the dimensions and setup of your pool, you may prefer to do some of the brushing with a handheld brush from inside the pool.",
        "Brush the walls in a downward motion.",
        "After you\u2019ve attached the brush head to the pole, move the brush over the walls in a downward motion to loosen any algae and debris.",
        "Make sure to brush all the way around pool so all of the walls are cleaned.",
        "For the cleanest pool, try to brush it at least once a week.",
        "Use a brush on the ladder.",
        "In addition to the walls, it\u2019s important to clean other surfaces in your above ground pool.",
        "If there is a ladder, make sure to go over it with the brush as well to remove any residue or algae.",
        "You may find it easier to brush the ladder with a handheld brush.",
        "If you have a set of stairs in your pool, make sure to brush those as well.",
        "Vacuuming the Pool Invest in an automatic pool vacuum.",
        "Vacuuming a pool is a critical part of keeping it clean.",
        "Doing the job manually, though, can be time-consuming so you may want to invest in an automatic vacuum.",
        "It attaches to the pool\u2019s filter system to move the dirt and debris out of the pool and moves around automatically so you don\u2019t need to do any work.",
        "Make sure to choose an automatic pool vacuum designed specifically for above ground pools so you know that it will work best for your pool\u2019s materials and dimensions.",
        "If you have an automatic pool cleaner, you can run it daily or every other day so you can be sure that the pool is always clean.",
        "Attach a vacuum head to a pool pole.",
        "To vacuum an above ground pool manually, you\u2019ll need a vacuum head with brushes or rollers to remove the dirt and debris from the bottom of the pool.",
        "Secure it on the end of a telescopic pool pole that will allow you to move around the entire floor of the pool.",
        "Before you plan to vacuum your pool, you should skim the surface of any leaves or other debris.",
        "If you vacuum your pool manually, make sure to do it at least once or twice a week.",
        "Secure a hose to the vacuum and put it in the pool.",
        "After you\u2019ve attached the vacuum head to the pole, insert the swivel end of a vacuum hose into the head.",
        "Place the vacuum into the bottom of the pool near the skimmer water return outlet.",
        "Lean the pole against the side of the pool as you\u2019re readying the vacuum in a secure position so it won\u2019t fall into the water.",
        "Place the other end of the hose in the skimmer hole.",
        "Hold the free end of the vacuum hose in the water in front of the skimmer return outlet to fill it with water.",
        "Wait until there are no longer any bubbles coming from the vacuum head, and insert the free end of the hose into the return outlet.",
        "Move the vacuum along the bottom of the pool to remove debris.",
        "With the vacuum hose attached, take hold of the vacuum\u2019s pole and begin moving it across the bottom of the pool.",
        "Take your time to ensure that you pick up all of the debris and cover the entire floor of the pool.",
        "To ensure that you pick up all of the debris, try to overlap your strokes as you move the vacuum to go over each area twice.",
        "Maintaining the Pool\u2019s Chemical Levels Test the chemical levels several times a week.",
        "The chemical levels in your pool play a major role in how clean the water stays.",
        "Two to three times a week, use a testing kit to check the pH and chlorine levels to ensure that they are in the proper range.",
        "Add the proper chemicals to bring them to the proper levels if necessary.",
        "A digital test strip reader is usually the easiest way to test the pool\u2019s chemicals levels.",
        "Dip a testing strip in the water, and insert into the reader to determine the levels.",
        "Other strips change color and provide a chart to help you determine whether the levels are correct.",
        "It\u2019s crucial that the water\u2019s pH is at the right level to ensure that the sanitizers work properly to keep the water clean.",
        "It should be between 7.2 and 7.6 to maintain clean pool water.",
        "The chlorine level in your pool should be between 1 and 3 parts per million (ppm).",
        "Adjust the chemicals as necessary.",
        "If you test the pool's water and the levels aren't correct, you usually need to add chemicals to the pool to address the specific level.",
        "In most cases, it will be the pH that requires your attention.",
        "If the pH is too high, add a pH reducer to the water according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "If the pH is too low, add a pH increaser to the water according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "If your pool\u2019s chlorine levels are too low, you should add chlorine to the water.",
        "If the chlorine levels are too high, stop adding chlorine to the water and leave the water alone for a day or so to help lower the level.",
        "Use a floater to keep a steady amount of chlorine in the pool.",
        "Chlorine tablets are the most effective sanitizer for above ground pools because they dissolve gradually to slowly release free chlorine into the water.",
        "Fill a floating chlorine dispenser with the tablets according to the instructions, and place it in the pool.",
        "Make sure to refill the floater on a weekly basis to ensure that there is always a steady supply of chlorine for the water.",
        "If you prefer, you can install an automatic chlorine feeder for your above ground pool.",
        "It attaches to the filter system and uses tablets that dissolve even more slowly so you don\u2019t need to refill it as often as a conventional floater.",
        "Shock the pool weekly to remove contaminants.",
        "Even if you try to maintain proper chemical levels in your pool, debris from swimmers, such as sunscreen residue and perspiration, can still build up in the water.",
        "Using a shock product can help boost chlorine levels in a hurry to remove contaminants.",
        "Add the chemical to the water if your chlorine level falls too low or the water begins to look dull.",
        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions regarding how to how add the shock to the water.",
        "Even if your chemical levels are balanced, you may want to shock the pool after heavy use or a storm to keep the water clean.",
        "In most cases, you shouldn\u2019t need to shock your pool more than once every or every other week.",
        "After shocking the pool, you can\u2019t swim it in for a while.",
        "In most cases, you need to wait until the chlorine levels fall back to 3 to 4 ppm but consult the shock\u2019s instructions to be sure."
