Regardless of habitat you will need a big box (cardboard, plastic, anything as long as it's a box that they will fit and there is at least 6 inches of room for furniture or d\u00e9cor). You can also design a cozy house, or just a bed. The bed has to have a mattress, blanket, and pillow. For grassland you could use ribbon or green string as grass. Or for the mountains Styrofoam like snow, but other methods recommend are things like paint and model magic or other air-dry clay that you could spike or create designs in if you want them in a house instead of their natural habitat."

The garage or a place with lots of steel for steel types (like Beldum), near an electric socket or a window in a thunderstorm with lightning for electric types (like Pikachu, Pachirisu, Emolga, Electrike, or Dedenne) take them to the gym on occasions for fighting types (like Hariyama), bug types (like Caterpie or Parasect) and grass types (like Snivy or Rowlet) will enjoy being kept near plants, and normal or fairy types depend.

They might enjoy some Poffins with you. Poffins can be sugar cookies, dinner rolls, etc. Rare candy can be bought at stores in the shape of gumballs or chocolate balls, or you can pretend that you found new rare candy that is a gummy bear or some Smarties.
