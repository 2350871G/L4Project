WD-40 is a common household lubricating oil that can be used on everything from bicycle chains to door hinges. If your lock isn\u2019t in real bad shape, a little squirt of WD-40 will probably be all you need. WD-40 is generally a great product to have on hand whenever there\u2019s an immediate need for an all-purpose lubricant, although it will eventually dry out and need to be reapplied. Avoid using any lubricants that aren\u2019t appropriate for home improvement use, such as cooking, botanical or sewing machine oil. Most oils will just attract dust that then forms new layers on the locking mechanism, making the problem worse."
