Murphy Perng\t\t\tCertified Wine Consultant\t\t\t\tWhat Our Expert Does: The easiest way to aerate wine is to pour the bottle into a decanter and let it sit for about 2 hours before you drink it. The opening of a wine decanter allows more of the wine to come into contact with the air, so the wine will oxidize and open up. That way, you'll be able to pick out the floral smells and fruit flavors in the wine more easily."
