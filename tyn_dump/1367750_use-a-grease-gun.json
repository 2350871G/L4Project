Insert the new grease cartridge into the barrel of the gun.  Note the pull-tag on the end of the new cartridge.  Ensure that cartridge is pushed in enough so that the rim is in contact with the rim of the grease gun.  Reinstall the barrel to the end cap but keep it loose.  Release the rod handle by turning it out from the retaining groove in the end cap.  Depress the rod handle; this will force grease into the head of the grease gun and force air out.  Pump some grease through the nozzle and wipe it clean before attaching the nozzle to the gun.  Tighten the cap and push down on the air bleeder to force out the rest of the air.  Place the grease gun coupler at the end of the extension hose directly on the area to be greased.  Pump the lever handle enough times for grease to begin flowing.  Loading by Suction from a Tub of Grease Remove the head from the barrel as above.  Put a large amount of grease in the head and pack firmly.  Position the barrel of the gun over a tub of grease.  Insert the barrel down about 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the grease.  Push down on the barrel while pulling up on the plunger or rod handle.  Lock the rod handle when it is fully extended.  Move the gun barrel from side to side to cut off the extra grease after the barrel is full.  Clean off all parts with stiff paper, paper towel or rag.  Attach the gun barrel to the rest of the unit.
