You should consult your vehicle\u2019s manual for specific instructions about how to remove and replace it.

You might have to remove screws that hold a panel in place just below the glove compartment. On GM sedans, the filter is located in a casing beneath the dashboard on the driver's side. After lowering the glove compartment or removing the panel just beneath it, locate the clip that secures the air filter cover. Pinch the clip to release and remove the cover. Pull the old filter straight out of its housing and replace it with a new one. You should change your car's cabin air filter once a year.
