        "Use a hydrometer to check the specific gravity of the must.",
        "After you\u2019ve combined the ingredients to form the must, you can use a hydrometer to check the specific gravity of the mixture.",
        "This will allow you to determine the potential alcohol content of your mead.",
        "It\u2019s important to check the gravity of the must before you add your yeast because it will be difficult to alter the mixture once the yeast begins working to ferment the must.",
        "The baseline reading of your must should be somewhere between 1.060 and 1.120 on the hydrometer.",
        "Add the yeast to the must.",
        "Once you\u2019ve got the must flavor profile and ABV that you want, it\u2019s time to add the yeast.",
        "A standard packet of brewing yeast is enough for up to 5 gallons (19 L) of mead, so use 1 gram (or one-fifth of the packet) if you're only making 1 gallon (3.8 L) of mead.",
        "Simply stir the yeast into the must and mix it in thoroughly.",
        "Adding too much yeast will only make the fermentation process go a little faster and will not damage or alter the taste of your mead.",
        "Seal the container of must and attach an airlock with a rubber stopper.",
        "When the enzymes in the yeast begin to break down the sugars in the honey, it will release gasses that can build up in the container and potentially explode.",
        "Use a rubber stopper that fits over the opening in the container, then place the stem of the airlock into the hole of the rubber stopper, and place them both into the opening of the container.",
        "It\u2019s important that you have an airlock so you can release the gasses while keeping the mead free from any contamination.",
        "Whether you\u2019re using a plastic container or a glass carboy, it needs to be sealed so the fermentation process can begin, and an airlock is needed to allow the gasses to escape.",
        "Fermenting and Bottling the Mead Stir the container twice a day for the first 48 hours to begin fermentation.",
        "To get the fermentation process started, you\u2019ll need to mix the ingredients twice a day for the initial 48 hours, but not past that period.",
        "Make sure any utensils you use to stir the mixture are fully sanitized so you don\u2019t introduce any bacteria into the container or the mead.",
        "Stir the mixture for about 2 minutes or so, and be sure to seal the container when you are done.",
        "If you are fermenting the mead in a carboy or a container with a narrow opening at the top, you can lightly shake the container to mix it.",
        "Wait 10 days then siphon the mead into a clean container from the top.",
        "During the fermentation process, a layer of sediment will form at the bottom of the container.",
        "Use a siphoning hose or tube to transfer the mead into another clean container to separate it from the sediment.",
        "Place the container of mead on a higher surface level, insert a siphon hose in the mead, and shake the hose up and down to start the flow of liquid into a clean container below it.",
        "Place the siphoning tube at the top of the liquid so you don\u2019t transfer any sediment.",
        "The clean container should be large enough able to hold all of the mead.",
        "If the new container does not have a rubber stopper and airlock, you can clean the sediment out the original container, sanitize it, and add the mead back into it to continue fermenting.",
        "Check the ABV again with the hydrometer to track the progress of the fermentation.",
        "Make sure the new container is sterilized.",
        "Seal the clean container and allow it to sit for at least 4 weeks.",
        "Once you\u2019ve siphoned the mead and separated it from the sediment in the container, seal the new container with an airlock to allow the gasses to escape.",
        "Store the container in a warm dry place for a few weeks to continue the fermentation process.",
        "Eventually, sediment will collect on the bottom of that container as well, siphon the liquid into another clean container to separate it from the sediment again.",
        "Siphoning, or \u201cracking,\u201d to separate the mead from the collected sediment may need to be repeated several times during the fermentation process.",
        "Repeat the racking process until your mead is clear and no longer cloudy.",
        "Check the ABV of your mead before you bottle it.",
        "After your mead has fermented for at least a few weeks, it may be ready for bottling.",
        "But you need to take another reading with your hydrometer to confirm that the alcohol by volume (ABV) is where you want it to be.",
        "Different tasting meads will have different readings:\nDry tasting mead will read between 0.099 to 1.006.",
        "Medium tasting mead that is slightly sweet and slightly dry will read between 1.006 to 1.015.",
        "Sweet mead will fall between 1.012 to 1.020.",
        "Very sweet dessert mead will read anywhere past 1.02.",
        "Fill your bottles from the bottom up.",
        "Once your mead is finished and ready for final bottling, use a siphon to transfer the mead from the container.",
        "Put a length of tubing from the container of mead to the bottom of the empty bottle, shake the hose up and down in the mead to start the flow, and fill the bottles from the bottom up to minimize exposure to oxygen.",
        "Cap or cork the bottles as soon as you finish filling them.",
        "You can enjoy the mead whenever you like, but the longer it ages, the more flavorful it will be.",
        "The bottles and equipment must be sanitized to avoid tainting or spoiling the mead.",
        "Stored in a cool place away from direct sunlight, your mead can last up to 2 years!"
