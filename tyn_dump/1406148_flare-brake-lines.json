Cutters will cut round tubing squarely without causing burrs. You will have to remove burrs if you use a hacksaw. Use a flaring tool or a double flare tool to form the tubing's flare. The instructions for both types of single flare tools are given below. Put the cone of the tool over the end of the tubing. Lower the cone down until it is centered over the tube's end. Turn the advance screw to move the cone until the part of the tube being flared is firmly against the countersunk recess of the bar.  Inspect the new flare for cracks, splits or other imperfections. Cut or use a different piece of tubing if any are found. Generating Tool Place the cone over the end of the tubing and move it down until the cone is centered. On a generating flare tool, the flare is formed in the air instead of in the recessed part of the bar. Turn the advance screw several revolutions. Check the manual for the number of revolutions needed for the flare size you need. Check the new flare for any imperfections such as splits. Cut or use different tubing if any imperfections are found. Double Flaring Tool (New Standard) Clamp your tubing into the flaring bar. Ensure the depth is equal to the edge of your tubing size insert. Install the yoke and use it to advance the cone into the tube until a bell shape forms. Remove the insert and finish advancing the cone into the bell. The bell shape of the tube forms the double thickness flare.",
