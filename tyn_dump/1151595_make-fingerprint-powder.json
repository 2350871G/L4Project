Identifying Fingerprints Catalogue your family. Ask each of your family members for a fingerprint. Tape the fingerprints on a notecard or a white sheet of paper. Record each family member\u2019s name, birthday, and gender. You can catalogue one finger or all ten if you\u2019d like. If you record all ten fingers, it will be easier to identify found prints. Classify your prints. Fingerprints come in three categories: arch, loop, and whirl. These patterns are found in the lines from the fingerprints. An arch looks like a short bump. A loop looks like a long, thin arch. A whirl resembles a circle surrounded by smaller lines. These classifications are important when identifying fingerprints.
