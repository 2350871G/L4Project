However, if you have an especially narrow or wide arm, or if you plan to take the blood pressure of a child, you may need a different size. Check the size of a cuff before buying it. Look at the \"index\" line. This is the range line on the cuff that tells you if it fits. Once it is on the patient's arm it will tell you whether or not the circumference of your arm fits within the \"range\" area of the cuff.

        "Note the measurement on your gauge at the precise moment you hear your heartbeat again.",
        "This measurement is your systolic reading.",
        "Systolic blood pressure refers to the force your blood exerts against the artery walls as your heart pumps.",
        "This is the blood pressure created when your heart contracts.",
        "Listen for the diastolic reading.",
        "Note the measurement on your gauge at the precise moment the sound of your heartbeat disappears.",
        "This measurement is your diastolic reading.",
        "Diastolic blood pressure refers to your blood pressure in between heartbeats.",
        "Rest and repeat the test.",
        "Let the cuff completely deflate.",
        "After several minutes, follow the same steps to take another measurement.",
        "If your blood pressure is still high, consider comparing readings with the other arm.",
        "Mistakes can happen while taking your blood pressure, especially if you are not used to doing it.",
        "As such, it is important to double-check your findings by taking a second measurement.",
        "Interpreting the Results Know what normal blood pressure should be.",
        "For an adult, the systolic blood pressure should be less than 120 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure should be less than 80 mmHg.",
        "This range is considered \"normal.\"",
        "Healthy behaviors, including diet and exercise, should be maintained in order to maintain this blood pressure range.",
        "Catch signs of prehypertension.",
        "Prehypertension is not necessarily dangerous by itself, but someone with prehypertension is at risk of experiencing hypertension in the future.",
        "An adult in a state of prehypertension will have a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 139 mmHG and a diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg.",
        "Talk to a health care professional about making changes to your diet and lifestyle in order to drop your blood pressure.",
        "Detect signs of stage 1 hypertension.",
        "During state 1 hypertension, also known simply as high blood pressure, an adult's systolic blood pressure is between 140 ad 159 mmHg.",
        "The diastolic blood pressure is between 90 and 99 mmHg.",
        "Hypertension requires professional medical care.",
        "Schedule an appointment with your doctor so that he or she may prescribe an appropriate hypertension medication.",
        "Assess whether you have stage 2 hypertension, also known as high blood pressure.",
        "This is a serious condition and requires prompt medical care.",
        "If your systolic blood pressure is at or above 160 mmHg and your diastolic blood pressure is at or above 100 mmHG, you have stage 2 hypertension.",
        "Understand that blood pressure can also be too low.",
        "If your systolic blood pressure stays around 85 mmHg and your diastolic blood pressure remains around 55 mmHG, your blood pressure may be too low.",
        "Symptoms of low blood pressure include lightheadedness, fainting spells, dehydration, lack of concentration, vision problems, nausea, fatigue, depression, rapid breathing, and clammy skin.",
        "Talk with your doctor to discuss possible reasons behind your drop in blood pressure and possible ways to raise it up to normal levels.",
        "Consult a physician if you suspect you have any stage of hypertension or low blood pressure.",
        "Your doctor will retest your blood pressure to make sure your readings are accurate.",
        "If you do have hypertension, or prehypertension, your doctor will make recommendations for lowering your blood pressure.",
        "This will include lifestyle changes, if you have prehypertension, in addition to medication if you have actual hypertension.",
        "The doctor may also test for other conditions that hinder normal blood pressure, especially if the patient is already on medication.",
        "If you are already on medication for your blood pressure, your doctor may suggest therapy or consider testing for additional health problems that prevent the medication from working properly."
