You won't need to worry about the brand or type of dish soap when shopping, as most any dish detergent will work just fine. Head out to the store and find a soap that has a scent that you enjoy to get started. Make sure the dish detergent is bleach-free. You can buy any scent of dish detergent that you would like. You can also try adding your own scents with things like lavender oil."

Here are some basic tips to help you pick the right wash cycle:\nQuick washes are great for clothes that aren't very dirty or items that you want to wear again soon. Pre-wash can add an extra soak to help break up dirt. Permanent press settings will help maintain presses in any clothing items that have them. Heavy-duty will be a long cycle that will aggressively clean heavily soiled items. This setting is not recommended for delicate clothing. Delicate setting is used for fragile items that are easily damaged in the wash. Extra rinse will add another rinse cycle at the end of the wash, ensuring the clothes are clean."
