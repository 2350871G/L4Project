    "text": " Mapping out Where to Cut Put on your pair of jeans. Marking where you want to distress your jeans will be easier when you're wearing them. You can also get a feel of where the jeans would wear down naturally, like around your knees. Any pair of denim jeans will work, as long as you don't mind altering them! Use a washable marker to mark where you want to distress. Draw lines to mark where you want the top and bottom of the holes you want to make. Focus on areas that would wear down naturally, like the knees, over the front and back pockets, and the upper thigh. The size of the holes you make is completely up to you. Take off your jeans and place them on a flat surface. This will be your workstation. You can use any kind of sturdy surface, like a shoebox, a small footstool, or a table. Don't try to distress your jeans while wearing them or you could hurt yourself with the razor. Cutting Your Denim Put a thick magazine inside the jeans under where you\u2019ll be distressing. A thick magazine will help prevent you from accidentally cutting other areas of your jeans where you don\u2019t want slits or holes. The magazine will also help keep the denim taut, making it easier for you to cut. If you don\u2019t have a magazine lying around, a thick notebook or a piece of cardboard should also do the trick. Use a razor blade to carefully make slits where you\u2019re distressing. Add the first slit where you want the bottom of your hole to be. Then add horizontal slits at 0.5 in (1.3 cm) increments until you reach the top of where you want the hole to be. Make the slits as long as you want the holes to be. Do this for every area you want to distress. Be very careful when using a razor blade so you don't cut yourself. You might want to wear a pair of thick gloves for extra protection. Pull the threads of the slits apart to create natural-looking holes. Once you\u2019ve made slits with your razor blade, use some tweezers or a bobby pin to open the slits wider. Use your fingers to pull apart threads that become exposed. Keep pulling the threads apart until you get holes that are the size and shape you want. Fray pockets and other areas with a disposable shaving razor. Move the disposable razor back and forth to scrape the area you want to distress. Keep scraping until you get the look you want. A disposable razor works great on the zipper area, waistband, pockets, and the hemline. Use caution when using a disposable razor. Wash and dry your jeans twice. Washing your jeans will help clear out any loose threads hanging around. Washing and drying them twice will also help make the new holes look more worn. After this step, your new, stylish distressed jeans will be ready to wear! Finished! ",
