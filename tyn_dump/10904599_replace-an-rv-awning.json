        "Removing the Awning Fabric Lock the rear spring of the awning.",
        "There are 2 springs in the roller tube\u2014one at each end.",
        "Lock the spring at the rear\u2014or left\u2014side of the awning by removing the black plastic cap.",
        "Afterward, insert a Phillips head screwdriver and leave it in place.",
        "Don't remove the screwdriver from the rear spring.",
        "Remove the right arm from the right bracket.",
        "Head to the front\u2014or right\u2014side spring, release the tension, and remove it by loosening the bolt that holds the arm to the roller tube.",
        "Now, remove the bolt and the arm.",
        "Afterward, reinsert the bolt and put some tape on the bracket to protect it from getting scratched.",
        "Release the spring tension of the awning.",
        "Firmly plant the vice grips on the right awning leg's bracket.",
        "Keep a firm grip on the vice grips and lift them slightly to release pressure from the awning control lever.",
        "Now, flip the lever to the \"Rolled Up\" position and carefully unroll the awning.",
        "Be sure to count the exact number of rotations required to fully unwind the awning as you need to roll it up later.",
        "Remove the vice grips when you're done.",
        "Mark the location of the awning control lever using a felt marker.",
        "Always do this before removing the spring assembly from the right side of the roller tube.",
        "This allows you to reassemble the awning in the exact same spot.",
        "Don't use permanent marker!",
        "Remove the rivet from the end cap.",
        "Drill one of the pop rivets that hold the end cap onto the roller tube using a cordless drill.",
        "Now, remove the remainder of the rivet using your hammer and punch by hitting the top of the rivet as you hold the punch directly above it.",
        "Always hold the punch perpendicular to the awning Remove the remaining rivet.",
        "With one person at each end, rotate the roller tube so you can access the remaining pop rivet at the opposite side of the endcap.",
        "Now, drill it and punch it out just like you did with the first one.",
        "Slide off the right spring assembly.",
        "Once both rivets are removed, gently slide the entire right side's spring assembly out of the roller tube.",
        "Carefully set it aside on a clean surface when you're done.",
        "Double check that both rivets are removed before taking off the right spring assembly.",
        "Unwind the old awning fabric slowly to remove it.",
        "Lift the roller tube and unwind the old fabric one turn at a time until it's completely off the tube.",
        "For the best results, have a friend help.",
        "Use a felt marker to make 2 marks on the roller tube\u2014a straight line to mark the channel that the main part of the awning goes into, and a V at the channel that the decorative valance slides into.",
        "Cut the fabric in 2 if it's stuck on the tube.",
        "Slide a razor knife through the fabric between the 2 channels that hold the valance and main awning.",
        "Now that the vinyl is cut into 2 separate pieces, each one will slide out of the rubber tube easily.",
        "Skip this step if you can remove the fabric in one piece without trouble.",
        "Attaching the New Fabric Spray silicone lubricant into the channels.",
        "This will make it easier to slide the new fabric in.",
        "Hold the nozzle about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the channels and release your hand from the trigger every 1 to 2 seconds to avoid over-application.",
        "Try to spray the lubricant evenly across each channel.",
        "Slide the 2 beads into their channels.",
        "Note the marks on the roller tube\u2014the beading on the main awning side goes into the track with the straight line, while the beading on the valance side goes into the channel with the V. Gently pull the end along the tube to simultaneously feed both beads into the channels.",
        "If possible, have 2 helpers hold the rolled up fabric off the ground.",
        "Otherwise, place it onto 2 bricks to hold it up.",
        "Center the fabric between the endcaps.",
        "Use a tape measure to make sure the fabric is perfectly centered between each cap.",
        "Don't proceed to the next step until the fabric is perfectly centered or it won't roll into the tube properly.",
        "Roll the new fabric onto the roller tube.",
        "Always roll the fabric counterclockwise.",
        "Take your time and roll the fabric as evenly and smoothly as you can.",
        "If you have 1 to 2 friends that can help with this step it will be a lot easier.",
        "Reinsert the spring assembly into the end of the roller tube.",
        "Be sure to line up the awning control lever with the mark on the side of the tube.",
        "The rivet holes should also line up.",
        "Now, use your pop riveter to replace the rivets in the end cap and securely fasten it to the roller tube.",
        "Retighten the spring assembly by rotating it counterclockwise.",
        "Attach your vice grips to the roller tube bracket and click the awning control level to the roll down position.",
        "Then, rotate the spring counterclockwise to retighten it.",
        "Count the same number of rotations as when you removed the spring earlier.",
        "Be sure to keep a tight hold on the vice grips.",
        "Reattach the right awning arm to the roller tube.",
        "After the spring assembly is tightened, remove the protective tape from the right bracket and snap the support arm into place.",
        "Now, remove the Phillips screwdriver from the left side of the roller tube and replace the black plastic track.",
        "Place the roller tube onto the track and bolt the new awning into place.",
        "Reattach the 2 small screws that prevent the fabric from sliding.",
        "Now, reattach the main bolts\u20142 on each side and 4 in total\u2014using a cordless drill with the proper bolt tip.",
        "If your awning folds into the side of your RV, press in the spring and grip the bracket at the left of the roller tube before attaching the bolts."
