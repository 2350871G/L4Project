        "It\u2019s really a matter of personal preference.",
        "Go sinker-free for the classic wacky rig setup.",
        "Generally, a wacky rig uses only the weight of the hook and the plastic worm as the sinker, meaning it sinks very slowly while the fake worm wiggles away in a \u201cwacky\u201d fashion.",
        "In this case, simply tie the line directly through the hook eye using your preferred knot.",
        "The classic wacky rig setup is a good choice during or after spawning season when fish tend to hang out in shallower water and move more slowly.",
        "Add a sinker to utilize the \u201cdrop shot\u201d setup.",
        "Use a palomar knot to secure the wacky-rigged hook at a chosen distance\u2014for instance, 2 ft (61 cm)\u2014from the end of the line.",
        "Then, tie a spherical \u201cdrop shot\u201d weight to the end of the line.",
        "This setup suspends your bait and hook above the bottom of the body of water.",
        "Because you can adjust the height at which the bait is suspended, you can use the drop shot setup in a wide range of fishing scenarios, based on the depth at which your target fish are congregating.",
        "Choosing the Right Equipment Try different sizes and styles of plastic worms for bass and other fish.",
        "If you\u2019re looking to catch bass, which is the target that plastic worms were originally designed for, try a 6\u20137 in (15\u201318 cm) worm with a dark color like purple or brown.",
        "For other types of fish, buy several different varieties and try them out\u2014then stick with whatever type works best for you!",
        "Originally, plastic worms were fairly standardized at 6 in (15 cm) in length.",
        "Today, plastic worms range in length from about 4.5 in (11 cm) to 10 in (25 cm).",
        "They come in many colors, and some have appendages so they look more like salamanders or other forms of bait.",
        "Plastic worms are also weighted differently so that they\u2019ll sink more or less readily on their own.",
        "Pick a hook and sinker combo that suits bass fishing or your preferred target.",
        "If you\u2019re bass fishing, for instance, try an offset-shank hook sized at 3/0, along with a bullet sinker that weighs between 0.062\u20130.75 oz (1.8\u201321.3 g).",
        "However, since plastic worms are so adaptable, they can be used with most varieties of hooks and sinkers, or no sinker at all.",
        "As with choosing the best plastic worm for your needs, your hook and sinker choices should depend largely on your own fishing preferences and experiences.",
        "Use a heavy action fishing rod and mid-range test line to catch bass.",
        "If you\u2019re using your plastic worm to attract bass, pick out a 7 ft (2.1 m), heavy action fishing rod for the job.",
        "Many bass anglers use a test line in the 12\u201317 lb (5.4\u20137.7 kg) range to round out this setup.",
        "Always keep in mind that plastic worms are very adaptable for use with many types of tackle and for many types of fishing.",
        "Use what works best for you!"
