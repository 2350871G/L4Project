If you wore a pad, the brown or red tinged water that you see going down the drain will likely be old blood that was stuck to your pubic hairs. It\u2019s important to rinse this off. Not cleaning off this old blood will cause an odor and it may also increase your risk of infection. Don\u2019t worry about the blood staining the shower. It will not make contact with it long enough to do this. Just keep the water running until your shower is over and then check to see if there\u2019s any blood that you need to rinse down the drain. If you\u2019re showering at a gym or in another public place, you may leave a tampon or menstrual cup in during the shower if you prefer."
