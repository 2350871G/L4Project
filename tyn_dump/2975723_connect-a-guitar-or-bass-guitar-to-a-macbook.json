                    "description": "You'll need some kind of interface or adapter that takes the signal from the guitar and gets it to the computer.A DI is a small amplifier which takes the (quiet) signal coming from your instrument and amplifies it before it goes into your Macbook. DIs come in either active or passive forms. Most six string guitars are passive by design (no amplification inside the instrument itself requiring a battery) and thus will require an active DI. Some bass guitars are active by design (require a battery in the instrument) and could use a passive DI, but in general active DIs are more common. Although DIs convert instrument signal effectively, they are most commonly used alongside professional recording equipment and thus may not have the appropriate outputs to get into your Macbook. Since you want to avoid adapting your connections / signal multiple times, make sure to find a DI that has the output you want. Search for an \"interface\". The term interface is often used for more complex options of connecting instruments to computers, and implies a more automatic compatibility with modern laptops via USB or other means. Search \"guitar macbook interface\" or similar to see some options. These work very similarly to DIs by amplifying the signal on its way to the laptop, but are sometimes sold in conjunction with software suites that help model various classic amplifiers and effects once your signal has made the leap to digital."
