                    "description": "Ducks eat a variety of aquatic plants and will settle in areas where they will be able to feed. Some examples of aquatic plants that ducks are attracted to are Widgeon Grass and Wild Celery. Wild celery grows under water up to the surface and produces seeds that ducks feed on. Ducks will also dive down to eat the tuber part of the plant. To plant the wild celery, be sure the bulbs are covered with a cheesecloth to prevent sunlight from getting to them. Be sure to plant the wild celery in less than 3 feet of water. Widgeon Grass grows completely underwater and provides food for ducks, geese, and fish. It is grown similarly to Wild Celery, with bulbs planted carefully in shallow water away from direct sunlight."

It grows easily in wet environments and attracts ducks, who love to eat it. It is a simple grass to plant because it does not take much upkeep, and it does not require fertilizer once it is planted. Plant chufa seeds approximately 1 to 2 inches deep into soil near your pond and in rows 2 to 4 inches apart."
