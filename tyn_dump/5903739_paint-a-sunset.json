Use yellow paint to create a straight horizontal line either just above or just below the middle of the canvas. This is your horizon line. Make a circle sun in the middle of the canvas just above the horizon line.  Pull yellow outwards from the edges of the sun toward the edge of the canvas. Stay going left to right with your brushstrokes. Clean your brush in between the color changes in the water cup and dab it dry on the paper towel.  Add orange above the yellow.  Blend the orange into the yellow by pulling it slightly down into the yellow. Pull the yellow into the orange to give an even blend. Notice the left side of the image is blended in while the right side is not. Add red the same way you added the orange. Make sure to blend it like you did the orange and yellow. In the left and right top corners of the canvas add some purple. Pull some of it down the sides of the canvas and into the middle of the top of the canvas, but be sure not to pull it too far that it no longer can blend. Around the sun add some white highlights to make it stand out. Pull the white into the surrounding colors. If it starts to fade into the colors too much you can always add more. Go back over the sun in yellow one more time to be sure that it is vibrant.  You can finish the bottom of the sunset however you would like! This one was finished with water.
