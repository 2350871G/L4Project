To separate the egg white from the yolk, break the egg against a flat surface, such as a countertop. Separate the egg into two halves over a bowl, and allow the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth, letting the white drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk until you\u2019ve removed all of the egg white. Superfine sugar is also known as caster sugar."
