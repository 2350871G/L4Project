                    "description": "Pour 1 part light corn syrup and 1 part clear alcohol into a little dish or shallow cup. Mix them well to fully combine the corn syrup (which will make the glaze shiny) with the alcohol (which will allow the glaze the harden as it dries). Warning: If you plan to use this technique, don\u2019t knead your fondant with fats (such as shortening or oil) or use tools or surfaces that have come into contact with oils or fats. Fats can cause this glaze to separate and create a bubbled or uneven surface, rather than one that is smooth and shiny. Use cornstarch instead. Using alcohol and corn syrup will give your fondant a permanent, high gloss shine. The exact amount will vary depending on the amount of fondant you need to glaze, but using 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of each component will usually work well for small decorations. Use alcohol that is 150 proof or higher. Vodka works well, but clear grain alcohols are also effective. If you prefer not to use alcohol, you can substitute vanilla extract or imitation vanilla extract for the alcohol."

For small elements, you\u2019ll want to use a small, soft brush. To cover an entire cake, a medium or large-sized brush will be much more efficient. However, skip overly stiff brushes and don\u2019t press too hard to avoid creating indentations on the fondant. It's best to apply the glaze in thin layers. Thicker coats will create a shinier appearance, but they will also take longer to dry. It can be difficult to apply this glaze to large areas quickly enough, as it tends to set quickly. Stick to small decorations or tackle larger projects in sections."
