He may pick up ammo and walk around, but isn't allowed to fire and cannot be hit during this time. He counts down the last five numbers loudly and says he/she's back in, and is then back in the game. He leaves the game permanently if he is down to zero hit points. East Coast Rules: Each player has ten hit points, and loses one point each time they are hit. There is no 20-second invulnerability period, like from the West Coast rules, but if several darts from the same automatic weapon hit you at the same time, this typically only counts as one hit.
