If the clothing is any other color, use color-safe bleach to avoid fading your clothing or covering it with white spots; this is a less powerful stain remover but may still succeed. Bleach is typically added to a separate washing machine dispenser than your laundry detergent, which should also be added as usual. If your top-loaded machine has no dispenser, or if you are washing the clothes by hand, pour directly into machine or tub. Use 1 part bleach to 30 parts water, or about 1/2 cup (120 mL) for a typical laundry load."
