Direct dyes are also available in liquids to help better control the amount you are adding. Unravel and presoak the rope under warm water until it is wet throughout. This process better prepares the rope to accept the dye. Wring out the rope as best as you can, leaving it a little damp. Wet fabrics will hold color better than dry material. Tie a small dowel to the end of the rope. This dowel will help you later on when you want to re-wrap the rope. It will also keep the end of the rope out of the pot to avoid it from getting tangled. Use a simple knot to attach the rope to the center of the dowel. Fill a large pot 2/3 full of water and bring it to a boil. Direct dye activates with heat. First, bring your water to a low boil. After it is boiling, bring the water down to a simmer. Use a pot different from one that you cook in, as the dye may stain and leave residue that should not be consumed. Add 1 tbsp (15 mL) of dish soap to the water. The addition of dish soap to your water will help the dye spread throughout the pot and coat the rope evenly. Slowly stir in the soap to avoid bubbles.

Dying Your Jute Rope Place the rope in the pot of simmering water. Wrap the end of the rope tied to the dowel around the handle of the pot to avoid more tangles and knots. In the end, you\u2019ll be able to cut off this undyed portion of the rope. Make sure the rope is completely submerged so all areas are dyed and that it can move freely in the pot. Pour the dye mixture into the pot. Slowly pour the measuring cup of dye and microwaved water into the simmering pot. Be mindful of splashing the dye, as this will stain clothes and certain materials. As you add the dye, use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir the pot. Add \u20442 cup (120 ml) of vinegar after 5 minutes. Adding vinegar will add to the intensity of the color. Stir the vinegar thoroughly. Distilled white vinegar works best for this step. Let the jute rope simmer for 30 minutes on low. With the heat setting on low, let the rope rest in the water for 30 minutes. Stir consistently with a wooden or plastic spoon to evenly spread the dye. Cleaning the Rope Dump the water and rope into a sink. Drain the water carefully into a clean sink. Avoid letting the water splash. It\u2019s okay if the rope falls into the sink too since you will have to rinse the excess dye from it. Wear rubber gloves and an apron to protect your skin and clothes from stains.
