                    "description": "All you\u2019ll need to create a simple, natural eyeshadow look are 2 colors of eyeshadow\u2014a base that\u2019s similar to the color of your skin, and another that\u2019s a few shades darker. While you can choose any colors you like, a neutral hue that complements your skin tone will look the most natural. If you have fair skin, use a base shade that's just a little darker than your skin tone. If your skin is darker, opt for a color that's a little lighter than your skin, to make sure it pops. For example, if your skin is fair, then you might choose a champagne or light beige eyeshadow as a base color and light brown or taupe eyeshadow as your second hue. If you have a darker complexion, then opt for a caramel shade as your base and accent it with a dark copper shade."

It's better to start with less product and add more, so don\u2019t press the brush into the shadow too hard. Most eyeshadow palettes come with a sponge-brush applicator, or you can use a separate eyeshadow brush with bristles if you have one. Since this is a simple look, you'll get a similar effect no matter which type of brush you use. If you don't have a brush, use a cotton swab or a sponge applicator, instead."

If you need to, apply a little more eyeshadow to the brush to ensure you get an even color, but make sure to concentrate the color along your lash line. Blend the brush upward, still moving back and forth, to just below your brow bone. The color should fade slightly as it gets higher toward the crease.

Keep sweeping the brush back and forth to blend in the color, or swipe your fingers across the area several times if you prefer.

When you\u2019re doing the second eye, try to make your eyeshadow look as close to the first eye as possible. Compare your eyes at the end to make sure they match, and make any changes that are needed. To make sure you get the same color on both eyes, be sure to clean off any lingering color from the brush. You can do this by swiping the brush across a paper towel or the back of your hand. If your eyeshadow doesn't look the same on both eyes, use your finger, a brush, or a cotton swab to wipe away some of the eyeshadow on the eye that has a little more. This will give you a more natural result than if you add more eyeshadow to the eye with less color."

        "Dust the brush across the darker powder and tap off any excess.",
        "Once you\u2019ve applied the base eyeshadow color, sweep your brush across your darker color.",
        "Since the darker eyeshadow will typically show up better than the base color, try to pick up less of the darker shade.",
        "A large shadow brush will work well for applying the first shade, but then you can switch to a smaller brush for the accent shade.",
        "Apply the dark shadow in the crease between your brow bone and eyelid.",
        "Sweep the brush in a half-moon shape that runs from the outside corner of your eye about 3/4 of the way down the crease of your eyelid.",
        "However, avoid putting the dark shade on the very inner corner of your eye, as this will make your eyes look smaller.",
        "Keep sweeping the brush back and forth to blend in the color, or swipe your fingers across the area several times if you prefer.",
        "Don\u2019t leave any harsh lines where the color stops.Tip: If you have hooded eyes, try placing the darker shade just above the crease to create the illusion that your upper lids are more visible.",
        "Repeat the process for the other eye.",
        "It\u2019s better to focus on one eye at a time, rather than switching back and forth.",
        "When you\u2019re doing the second eye, try to make your eyeshadow look as close to the first eye as possible.",
        "Compare your eyes at the end to make sure they match, and make any changes that are needed.",
        "To make sure you get the same color on both eyes, be sure to clean off any lingering color from the brush.",
        "You can do this by swiping the brush across a paper towel or the back of your hand.",
        "If your eyeshadow doesn't look the same on both eyes, use your finger, a brush, or a cotton swab to wipe away some of the eyeshadow on the eye that has a little more.",
        "This will give you a more natural result than if you add more eyeshadow to the eye with less color.",
        "Top with one coat of mascara to define your lashes.",
        "Eyeshadow powder can cling to your lashes, making them look lighter than normal.",
        "To counteract this, swipe on a coat of mascara.",

        "Trying a Simple Smokey Eye Sweep a dark shadow on your lids.",
        "Use an eyeshadow brush to sweep a dark shade of eyeshadow onto your lids going from your lashes to the crease.",
        "Opt for a dark color that you can pair with a medium and light shade of the same color, such as a charcoal with a medium grey and silver or a dark brown with a medium brown and beige.Tip: For more contrast, use a medium-dark shade, like a rich caramel or pewter color on your eyelid.",
        "Then, use a darker shade, like a coffee or slate-grey tone, along your crease.",
        "Apply a medium shadow on the crease.",
        "Next, sweep the medium shade over your crease going from the inner corner to the outer edge of your eye.",
        "This will begin to create a gradient effect going upwards.",
        "Make sure to use your second darkest shade for the crease, such as a medium grey or medium brown.",
        "Sweep a light shadow on the browline.",
        "The last eyeshadow color you apply should be the lightest one.",
        "Sweep this color above your crease and up to your brow.",
        "Opt for a shade with a bit of shimmer to highlight your eyes, such as a champagne with brown shades or silver with grey shades.",
        "Use your finger or a brush to blend the shadow up and out.",
        "Once the shadow is as dark as you\u2019d like it, lightly run your fingertips or a clean brush over your eyes to blend the shadow.",
        "Always move the brush up toward above your crease and out to the corner of your eye, as this will have a lifting effect.",
        "You can also blend your eyeshadow with a cotton swab if you\u2019d like.",
        "Brush a light color onto the inner corner of your eye to highlight it.",

        "If you used a cool color for your smoky eye, stick with a cool highlighting shade, and vice versa.",
        "If you\u2019d like, you can also highlight just under the arch on your brows.",
        "Line your upper lids with eyeliner for a more dramatic look.",
        "You can wear a smokey eye with or without eyeliner, but you\u2019ll get a more dramatic result if you do choose to use it.",

        "With so many options out there to choose from, it can be tempting to jump right in and start playing with bright, bold colors.",
