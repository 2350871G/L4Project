Let the sweatshirt cool down to room temperature, and then check the sizing. If you are satisfied with the amount your sweatshirt shrinks, you can launder it as normal. If you want to shrink your sweatshirt even more, use boiling water, your washing machine, and/or your dryer. To check the size, hold the shirt up to your torso and examine it in the mirror."

When your water comes to a boil, submerge your garments, put a lid on the pot, and turn off the heat. The boiling water helps shrink your shirt even more. If you want to shrink your shirt 1 size, leave it in the water for 10-15 minutes. If you hope to shrink your shirt 2 sizes, let it cool to room temperature. Do not do this if washing a polyester sweatshirt. The high temperatures can make the fabric rough or stiff. Polyester should not be heated above 178 \u00b0F (81 \u00b0C). Alternatively, put your sweatshirt in your sink and pour boiling water over top the garment. Then, let it cool to room temperature."

After you wash your sweatshirt, check the sizing before you put it in the dryer. To maximize your shrinkage, use the longest washing size. If you just want to shrink it 1 size, you can use a normal wash cycle. If you are washing a small load of laundry, you only need one half of a cap of detergent.
