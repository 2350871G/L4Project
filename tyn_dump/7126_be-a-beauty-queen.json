Learn how to apply makeup too. You could just go to a cosmetics counter at the mall, and ask to be shown a few tips. Always wear lipstick at the pageant. You can go for a subtle look \u2013 say nude liner and a non tinted gloss \u2013 but beauty queens don\u2019t let their lips stay bare. For a more vibrant look, line your lips with color, like pink or red, and then fill them in with matching lipstick. It\u2019s good to take care of your brows. Make them look natural, not overly exaggerated, but well groomed and arched. Get this done at a salon. Don\u2019t try to do it yourself. Save the heavy makeup for the actual pageant or you could end up clogging your pores, which leads to acne. Other makeup that is commonly worn by beauty queens includes, primer, foundation, concealer, powder, blush, eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara. Buy high-quality makeup. With a little research, you should be able to find quality makeup that doesn't break the bank. You want highly pigmented eyeliner that doesn't smear. Look for face powder that is triple milled so it doesn't become chalky."

                    "description": "Most people look better with a little color to their skin. However, using tanning beds is really risky. It can lead to melanoma and premature wrinkling. So if you\u2019re naturally really pale, try a spray tan instead. They look pretty natural these days. Test out the spray tan a few weeks before the actual pageant so you can make sure it looks good on your skin, and figure out the amount you want. A good bronzing powder can also give you a glowing tan look. You want a bronzer that's not too dark. You should also invest in a bronzing brush so it applies evenly."

Pageant hair should have some style to it. It shouldn\u2019t just hang there limply. To get volume in your hair, use a round brush. Divide the hair into sections. Work a section at a time. Try spraying a little dry shampoo into your roots. Then, use large Velcro rollers before you style your hair. Put hair spray on them, and leave them in for 20 minutes. You also may need a hairpiece. Choose one that isn\u2019t too over-the-top. You could also add a few hair extensions if you want fuller hair. Make sure they don\u2019t look obvious. Hairpieces can be a good idea when your hair needs some length or volume. Make sure they match your hair color and texture. They can also make your updo look better. For nails, you want to make sure they are not chipped or with peeling paint. Instead, go for an elegant look at a nail salon, like a French manicure. Don\u2019t forget your toes! Get a pedicure."

Instead, wear clothing in pastels. Wear clothes in lilac and pale blue or soft neutral shades with rose undertones. In the winter, when pastels don\u2019t work as well, wear clothes with white, navy blue, tomato red, and green. Think bright. It looks good on camera.

Think quality over super trendy; try a nice department store. Make sure your clothing matches your age. If you\u2019re a teenager, for example, you wouldn\u2019t want to do a too-cute routine in a cupcake dress. If the pageant participant is your young toddler, you don\u2019t want to cake on makeup or put them in too mature of a dress because judges won\u2019t like it, and you child is too young for that anyway. Try to pick an evening gown that matches your personality but is not too eye popping, trashy, or bubbly. For example, a gown that is too low cut or too short or has too much bling might be seen as trashy by some judges. Gowns that are too bubbly would include those with excessive feathers or tulle. You want an elegant look. For a swimsuit, pick a solid color two-piece bikini. Don\u2019t make it too low cut. For an interview, you should choose a classic dress with a belt, a sheath, or a skirt suit. Don\u2019t show cleavage."

Avoid anything that seems at all vulgar or otherwise inappropriate. Practice your talent. Some beauty queens say they train for two hours a day at dance. You\u2019re not going to be good at your routine if you don\u2019t practice it. Unless you\u2019re really, really good at it, stay away from the usual routines in things like dance or gymnastics. There will be a lot of competition, and if you\u2019re not advanced at it, you might look poor in comparison and score low.

        "As in, \"The best way to achieve world peace is to....",
        "etc.\"",
        "Answer honestly and from the heart.",
        "You want to be genuine.",
        "Avoid clich\u00e9d answers like \u201cworld peace.\u201d It's helpful to get some public speaking experience first.",
