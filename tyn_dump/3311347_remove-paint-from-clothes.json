        "It is unlikely that you will be able to remove the paint stain from this item.",
        "Soak the item of clothing in warm water.",
        "Leave the garment to soak for at least an hour, preferably longer.",
        "Occasionally rub the stained area with your hands to loosen the remaining solvent.",
        "Rub a high-quality laundry detergent into the stained area before soaking.",
        "If you don\u2019t have laundry detergent, mix dishwashing soap into the warm water to help cut the grease in the paint and solvent.",
        "Launder the garment immediately after soaking.",
        "Remove your clothing from the warm water, give the stained area one last scrub, and then wash it according to its care directions.",
        "Removing Paint From Sensitive Fabrics Identify sensitive or dry-clean only clothing.",
        "If you are unsure about whether or not your clothing item is dry-clean only, check the care information and fabric content on its tag.",
        "Fabrics that are commonly dry-clean only include acetate, silk, wool, and velvet.",
        "Even if your clothing does not include these materials, if the care tag says \"Dry Clean Only\" follow the steps below to remove any latex or oil paint stains.",
        "Remove excess paint using a butter knife or a spoon.",
        "It is best to treat paint stains when they are still wet, so be sure to remove as much paint as possible as soon as you notice the stain.",
        "It is possible to damage sensitive fabrics by scrubbing too hard or using harsh brushes.",
        "For this reason it is best to remove excess paint using the dull side of a spoon or another similarly dull object.",
        "Blot the stain with a dry cleaning solution.",
        "Using a sponge dampened with a dry cleaning solution like Afta, gently blot the stain.",
        "To keep the stain from spreading, begin blotting from the outside edge of the stain and work your way to the center.",
        "Next, blot the stain with a dry spotter.",
        "Dry spotters contain dry solvents that will absorb grease and oil stains, and they are particularly helpful when removing oil paint stains.",
        "You can purchase dry spotter, or you can make it at home using coconut oil and liquid dry cleaning solvent.",
        "After blotting the stain with dry spotter, moisten a cloth with dry spotter and lay it on top of the stain.",
        "This will help pull the paint stain out of the clothing.",
        "Keep a cloth and dry blotter on the stain until it disappears.",
        "To prevent the stain from running or bleeding, change the cloth often.",
        "Keep the stain and the clean cloth damp with the dry spotter.",
        "They won't remove the paint when dry, and allowing the stain to dry will make it harder to remove later.",
        "Rinse with dry cleaning solvent.",
        "Once the stain has been completely removed, rinse the area one more time with dry cleaning solvent.",
        "This will help remove the dry blotter and any remaining oil or grease.",
        "Then let your clothing dry normally."
