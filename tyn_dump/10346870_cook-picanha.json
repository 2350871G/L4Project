Use a sharp knife to cut a criss-cross pattern into the fat, making sure you don\u2019t cut into the actual meat. Rub both sides of the meat with lots of salt. Sprinkle salt over each side of the picanha, using your hands to pat it into the meat if desired. Use a generous amount of salt, as this is the only seasoning that\u2019s necessary.

After the 5-8 minutes are up, use tongs to move the picanha to its other side. The picanha should be meat-side down, and you can let it cook like this for another 5 or so minutes. Remove the picanha from the heat once the outer layer is browned. After cooking the picanha for at least 5 minutes on each side, check to see that the fat and skin are seared on both sides. The picanha won\u2019t be fully cooked yet, which is okay. Cooking the Slices Slice the meat into 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) sections.
