        "If you want your dragon to have a longer face, then make a horizontal oval instead of a circle.",
        "Add a rounded trapezoid on the side of your circle for the dragon\u2019s snout.",
        "Choose either the left or right side of the circle depending on which way you want the dragon head to face.",
        "Draw the top horizontal line of the snout coming from the top of the circle so it\u2019s the same length as the circle\u2019s diameter.",
        "Make another horizontal line coming from the bottom of the circle to make the bottom of the snout.",
        "Connect the 2 lines so the corners are rounded.",
        "You can make the snout longer or shorter depending on how you want the dragon to look.",
        "Don\u2019t leave sharp corners on the end of the snout or else your dragon won\u2019t look natural.",
        "Make parallel lines coming out the bottom of the circle for the dragon\u2019s neck.",
        "Start one of the lines where the bottom of the snout connects to the head.",
        "Make a curved line coming down from the head as long as you want it.",
        "Then draw another curved line that\u2019s parallel to the first one on the opposite side of the head.",
        "The dragon\u2019s neck usually gets wider closer to its body, so you can make the lines get further apart near the bottom if you want to.Tip: Add a neck even if you don\u2019t plan on drawing the rest of the dragon\u2019s body.",
        "That way, the head will still have the illusion that it\u2019s connected to something.",
        "Sketch a curved horizontal line through the trapezoid to make a mouth.",
        "Start drawing the mouth in the middle of the trapezoid\u2019s narrow end.",
        "Extend the line horizontally so it ends near the middle of the dragon\u2019s head.",
        "Curve the end of the mouth up if you want your dragon to look like it\u2019s smiling, or angle it down if you want it to frown.",
        "Put a parallel line underneath the mouth if you want it to look like your dragon has a bottom lip.",
        "Draw triangles coming out from the mouth to give your dragon teeth.",
        "You can either add teeth that point up or down along your dragon\u2019s mouth.",
        "Choose anywhere along the mouth and draw a triangle that points up or down starting from the mouth line.",
        "Add 5-6 separate teeth in your dragon\u2019s mouth so it looks more fearsome.",
        "Don\u2019t line the entire mouth with teeth or else your drawing may start to look messy.",
        "You can have teeth pointing both up and down.",
        "Put a circle or triangle above the mouth to make an eye.",
        "Place the eye next to where the top of the snout connects to the side of the circle.",
        "If you want your dragon to look more realistic, draw a small circle for the eye so there\u2019s a small gap between it and the top of the snout.",
        "For a dragon that looks angrier, add a horizontal triangle so the point faces the snout.",
        "Don\u2019t make the eye too large or else you won\u2019t have room to add other features.",
        "Search for pictures of other reptiles to see what their eyes look like so you can use them as a reference.",
        "Add bumps and ridges on the top of the dragon\u2019s head for more texture.",
        "Dragons don\u2019t have smooth skin, so their heads will look bumpy and knobby from their scales.",
        "Use the outlines you currently have as guides and go over them to add curves to the snout.",
        "Use wavy or zig-zag lines going from the end of the snout toward the back of its head.",
        "For example, you may add a large bump above the dragon\u2019s eye if you want to give it a prominent brow.",
        "You can add as many or as few bumps and ridges to the dragon depending on how you want it to look.",
        "Give your dragon horns if you want to.",
        "If you want to add horns to your dragon, make a vertical line extending out from the top of the dragon\u2019s head.",
        "Extend the line out so it\u2019s about the same length as the snout.",
        "Add another line that starts on the back side of the dragon\u2019s head and connects to the end of the first line to complete the horn.",
        "Make the horn shorter if you want to make it seem like your dragon is younger.",
        "You can make the horns any shape you want.",
        "Look up horns on real animals to get influences for what you can include on your dragon.",
        "You may also choose to add horns or spikes running down the back of the dragon\u2019s neck if you want to.",
        "Erase the lines you used as guides.",
        "Go over your drawing with an eraser and get rid of any lines that aren\u2019t still a part of your dragon.",
        "For example, you may erase the circle or the original outline of the snout if you added more bumps to it.",
        "Continue erasing any guides or mistakes you made, and blow off the shavings when you\u2019re finished.",
        "Darker lines will be harder to erase than lightly sketched lines.",
        "Get a clickable detail eraser if you need to erase lines in small areas.",
        "You can get special erasers from an art store or online.",
        "Add details like scales and nostrils to make your dragon seem realistic.",
        "Once you erase the guide lines, start adding the final details into your drawing.",
        "Start with small ovals or circles for the nostrils at the end of the snout.",
        "Once you add the nostrils, draw in U-shaped lines on the sides of the dragon\u2019s head and down its neck give the illusion of scales.",
        "You don\u2019t need to draw every scale on the dragon\u2019s face since it could make your drawing look messy or unclear.",
        "Shade your drawing with a pencil or colored pencil if you want to add more perspective or color.",
        "Finished.",
        "Sketching an Eastern Dragon Head Make a circle with a rounded rectangle for the dragon\u2019s head and snout.",
        "Start by making a circle in the middle of your piece of paper so you have room to add features on each side.",
        "Choose the right or left side of the circle to put the snout depending on what direction you want the dragon to face.",
        "Start the rectangle halfway down from the top of the circle and connect the bottom edge to the lowest point of the circle.",
        "You can choose to make the dragon\u2019s snout thicker if you want.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, your dragon head will be in profile view.",
        "Sketch your lines lightly at first so you can easily erase them later on.",
        "Otherwise, you\u2019ll leave marks on the paper that you can\u2019t get rid of.",
        "Sketch in the dragon\u2019s neck coming out from the other side of the head.",
        "Start a line at the point where the bottom of the snout touches the circle.",
        "Curve the line slightly down so it looks like it extends off of the page.",
        "Draw the top of the neck coming from the top side of the circle so it\u2019s parallel with the first line you drew.",
        "While you don\u2019t have to draw the neck for your dragon, it adds to the illusion that the head is connected to a body.",
        "Chinese dragons have long, snake-like bodies, so the neck will stay the same thickness the entire time.",
        "Draw a horizontal line and triangles to give your dragon a mouth and teeth.",
        "Start the line for the mouth so it\u2019s a third of the way up from the bottom of the rectangle.",
        "Make a slightly curved horizontal line that ends near the middle of the dragon\u2019s head.",
        "Draw small triangles coming out from the top or bottom of the line to give the dragon sharp teeth.",
        "Give your dragon a smile if you want it to look happy or a frown if you want it to appear more fierce.",
        "Only add a few teeth to the mouth so the drawing doesn\u2019t look messy.",
        "Add a circle or oval above the mouth for your dragon\u2019s eye.",
        "Place the eye for your dragon inside the circle so it\u2019s next to where the top of the snout connects to the head.",
        "Make a circle or a horizontal oval for the eye so there\u2019s a small gap between it and the top of the head.",
        "Add an angled line above the eye to give your dragon an angry brow.",
        "The dragon\u2019s pupil can be round like a human, or you can make it look like a slit, similar to a snake or cat.",
        "Don\u2019t make the eye too large or else the dragon will look unnatural and you won\u2019t have room to place the rest of the features.",
        "Draw antlers or horns on top of your dragon\u2019s head.",
        "Chinese dragons usually have antlers that look like a deer, but they can also have standard spiked horns.",
        "If you want to add antlers, Draw a Y-shape coming out from the back of the dragon\u2019s head.",
        "Add lines on either side of the Y-shape so the antler ends in curved points.",
        "If you want to make horns, draw a long triangle coming out from the back of the dragon\u2019s head instead.",
        "You don\u2019t need to add antlers or horns at all if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "Sketch in ears underneath the antlers.",
        "Unlike many other dragons, Chinese dragons have ears on the sides of their head that look similar to cow or deer ears.",
        "Draw a curved line coming out from the side of the dragon\u2019s head and extend it so it\u2019s about half as long as the head\u2019s diameter.",
        "Add another curved line underneath the first one and connect the ends to make the ear.",
        "You don\u2019t need to draw the ear on the other side of the head since you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it from this perspective.",
        "Give your dragon a beard and mane.",
        "Chinese dragons have hair and manes around their heads that resemble a lion.",
        "Put in wavy lines that end in points around the bottom of the snout and the back of the head.",
        "Draw the hair in tufts rather than adding the individual strands so your drawing doesn\u2019t get muddled.",
        "The mane will go behind your dragon\u2019s horns or antlers if it has them.",
        "You can make the hair as long or short as you want.",
        "Erase the guide lines that aren\u2019t a part of your dragon\u2019s head.",
        "Use the eraser on your pencil or a block eraser to clean up the lines on your drawing.",

        "Continue getting rid of lines you don\u2019t need in your drawing anymore and blow the shavings off when you\u2019re done.Warning: Don\u2019t wipe the drawing with your hand when you\u2019re done erasing your lines since you could easily smudge the pencil.",

        "Put in small circles or ovals near the front of the snout for your dragon\u2019s nostrils.",
        "Leave a small gap beside the nostril before drawing a long wavy line that ends near the back of the dragon\u2019s head.",
        "Make another parallel wavy line directly underneath the first one and connect the ends to add the whisker.",
        "Draw small smoke clouds coming out from the dragon's nostrils if you want to make it seem like it's about to breath fire.",
        "Shade your drawing with your pencil to make it look more realistic and add perspective.",
        "Use colored pencils if you want your dragon to look more colorful.",
