        "Erika Noble\t\t\tPCIA Certified Rock Climbing Instructor\t\t\t\tAccording to Erika Noble, rock climbing instructor, \"You can also practice looking for possible moves where you could use a hand-foot match!",
        "It's a more advanced move, but knowing when and where you could experiment with more technical moves on a climb is the first step to improving.\"",
        "Choose a big foothold that allows you to place your feet side by side.",
        "The best kind of hold for matching your feet is one big enough to rest comfortably on.",
        "It isn\u2019t the only type of hold you can use, but it is the easiest to practice on.",
        "Avoid any holds that look slippery, flat, or tiny, if possible.",
        "Wide ledges and jugs are common on beginner walls and are the easiest to practice on.",
        "As you advance, you may need to work with much smaller toeholds.",
        "Find a couple of stable handholds above the foothold.",
        "The more of a grip you have on these handholds, the easier matching and switching will be.",
        "Bigger holds are typically better if you have a choice.",
        "Make sure the holds are close to the foothold.",
        "If they are too far away, you won\u2019t be in a balanced climbing position, increasing your chances of slipping.",
        "Remember that smaller holds put more pressure on your fingers.",
        "When you match and switch with your feet, your grip strength may be all that is left keeping you on the wall.",
        "Step to the hold you plan on matching on.",
        "Scale the wall until you reach the hold you selected.",
        "Move your body above it so it is in range of your feet.",
        "Situate your hands on some holds higher up in the wall.",
        "Then, plant your first foot firmly on the foothold to set up the match and switch.",
        "Keep your body close to the wall to preserve your balance.",
        "Make sure you have a steady grip on the handholds.",
        "Move your foot to match on the hold.",
        "If you found a wide hold, plant your foot next to your other foot.",
        "Move at a steady pace that feels comfortable to you and allows you to maintain your grip on the handholds.",
        "Switching with your feet does put a little pressure on your arms, so be prepared for it.",
        "This \u201cstepping besides\u201d method works best for wide holds that provide plenty of space to rest on.",
        "If you have to work with small, rough, or poor holds, you may need to move a little faster to take the weight off of your hands.",
        "Switch by reaching your foot out the next hold on the wall.",
        "Lift up the first foot you planted on the hold.",
        "Quickly identify the next hold you need to move to in order to continue your climb.",
        "While holding yourself close to the wall with your hands, reach your foot out to step onto the next hold.",
        "Plant your foot to steady yourself and continue on your climb.",
        "Identifying the next foothold before you start the match and switch is important, especially if you\u2019re uncertain about your arm strength.",
        "Remember, your legs are stronger than your arms and you are more stable when you have both feet on the wall.",
        "Switching Feet on Bad Holds Switch from smaller holds by placing your feet on top of one another.",
        "During a climb, you may not find a perfect hold to rest both of your feet on at the same time.",
        "When this happens, climb up to a good foothold as you normally would.",
        "Plant your leading foot on the hold, then bring your other foot on top of it.",
        "Quickly slide your bottom foot out to land your top foot on the hold.",
        "Doing this takes a little more speed and accuracy than setting your feet side by side.",
        "Your feet can touch when you match them together.",
        "Don\u2019t spend much time with them on the same hold, however.",

        "Erika Noble\t\t\tPCIA Certified Rock Climbing Instructor\t\t\t\tEdging is a useful technique to get better at switching feet on bad holds.",
        "Erika Noble, rock climbing instructor tells us: \"Place the inside edge of your foot on the hold, pressing in with your big toe.",
        "Then, tuck your other foot on top and make the switch.",
        "Experiment with edging with both the inside and outside of your shoes to make use of small, difficult footholds!\"",
        "Perform a jump if you need to quickly switch on tiny holds.",
        "Jumping is somewhat similar to a regular switch and hold, but it requires a little extra arm strength.",
        "Climb up to the holds as normal, planting your lead foot on a suitable hold.",
        "Then, as you move your other foot to the hold, push your first foot off the wall.",
        "Use your lead foot to continue climbing as your other foot takes its position on the foothold.",
        "Jumping is necessary when you\u2019re stuck with small holds that can\u2019t support more than the tips of your toes on one foot.",
        "It\u2019s a very fast way to switch, so it allows you to climb at a steady pace.",
        "When you push off from the hold, you won\u2019t have either of your feet on the wall.",
        "Jumping doesn\u2019t take a ton of arm strength, but you may wish to avoid doing it if you\u2019re tired.",
        "Practice friction-based stepping if you have to step on the wall.",
        "Taking advantage of flat walls with rough surfaces through friction-based stepping.",
        "To perform the switch, plant your foot on the wall.",
        "Bring your other foot up next to it, then move your other foot back down to the foothold.",
        "This move is very precise, so it\u2019s great for dealing with tiny holds you would otherwise have to do a jump on.",
        "Friction-based stepping is slow and puts additional pressure on your fingers.",
        "It is also limited to flat, rough surfaces.",
        "You can do a jump almost anytime you have an opportunity to match and switch through friction-based stepping.",
        "The method you choose depends on your arm strength and what you prefer doing."
