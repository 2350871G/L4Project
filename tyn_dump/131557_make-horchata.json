    "text": " Making Rice Horchata Gather your ingredients. Authentic recipes call for white, long grain rice. It is possible to make horchata with different kinds of rice; just know that you will get a different flavor with different varieties of rice. Indian Basmati rice is a white, long grain rice. Your horchata will have a more \"rice-like\" flavor, so you may want to add a little extra cinnamon to counter this effect. Long grain brown rice will have a nutty flavor. It will not taste like authentic horchata, but it could be a tasty spin on this classic beverage. If you can find Mexican cinnamon (Canela), this will lend a more authentic flavor to your horchata. Canela is slightly milder than American cinnamon. Pulverize the rice. You can use a blender, coffee bean or grain mill to grind the rice. Try to get the rice to the consistency of a coarse polenta. This will allow the rice to better absorb the water and cinnamon. You can try to blend the rice with a food processor, but the rice may just whirl around and not actually break up. You can also grind the rice by hand using a metate, or corn grinding stone. If you can't get the rice that fine, simply break it up as much as possible. Pour the rice, cinnamon stick, and 3 cups of warm water into a bowl. Cover the mixture and allow it to come to room temperature. Allow the mixture to sit for a minimum of 3 hours, or overnight if possible. The longer you allow the mixture to soak, the more flavorful it will be. If you have the time, it is highly recommended that you give it 12 hours to soak. Don't refrigerate the mix. Let it sit out at room temperature. Pour the mixture into a blender and add 2 cups of water. If you do not have a blender or food processor, you will need to soak the rice in water for two days, or until the water becomes milky. The horchata may be grittier with this method, so be sure you strain it well and mix it up before drinking. If you have a hand-held or burr mixer, you can mix the horchata right in the bowl. Blend the mixture until smooth. This may take between 1 and 4 minutes, depending on your blender. Try to get the mixture as smooth as you possibly can. Strain the mixture through a sieve lined with three layers of cheesecloth or a very fine strainer. Pour just a little at a time, and use a spoon or spatula to stir the mixture as it goes through. If you have trouble straining the mixture because of a build up of rice gunk in the strainer, you can discard this as you go. Gather the cheesecloth at the top and twist to squeeze out any remaining liquid. Mix in the sugar until dissolved. You can substitute different sweeteners, like simple syrup, honey, or agave. Transfer the horchata to a pitcher and refrigerate.  Serve over ice with ground cinnamon or cinnamon stick as garnish.  Making Tiger Nut Horchata Gather your ingredients. Tiger nuts can be tricky to find. You can order them online or find them at an African grocery store. Place tiger nuts and cinnamon into a bowl and cover with water. The water should cover the nuts by at least two inches. Allow the tiger nuts to soak for 24 hours at room temperature. The nuts have to rehydrate, and because they can be so difficult to find, they may be older and take longer to become useable. Pour the tiger nuts, cinnamon, and soaking water into a blender.  Add 4 cups of hot water and blend until smooth. This should take about two minutes, depending on your blender. Strain the mixture through a strainer lined with a layer of cheesecloth or through a fine sieve. Use a spoon or spatula to stir the mixture as you strain, keeping any large particles from keeping the liquid from passing through the cloth. Gather the top of the cheesecloth and squeeze out any remaining liquid. Transfer the mixture to a pitcher and mix in sugar and salt. Use a large spoon or whisk to mix the horchata until sugar and salt have dissolved completely. You can substitute honey, simple syrup, agave, or other sweeteners for sugar if you wish. Refrigerate horchata until cold.  Serve over ice with a dash of cinnamon or cinnamon stick as a garnish.  Experimenting with Different Variations Add lime zest to the mix. Lime will compliment the other flavors in the drink. Just make that you only get the green part of the lime skin when you zest. The white is bitter and unpalatable. Add a cup of milk (regular, almond milk, or rice milk) for a creamier texture. Before the final blend, add only 1 cup of water and then add 1 cup of milk of your choosing. Add 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract for a touch of vanilla flavor.  Try making horchata with almond milk. Use 1/3 cup of rice, plus 1 cup of blanched and skinned almonds. Grind the rice separately, then add the almonds, cinnamon, and 3 cups of hot water, and allow the mixture to sit overnight. Proceed to blend and strain the mixture as normal.",
