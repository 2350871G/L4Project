The possibilities are endless, so try looking up a recipe online to find the color you want and to help you identify appropriate plants. Cut the plant material into small pieces. Use 1 part plant material to 2 parts water. Boil it together for an hour, and then strain out the plant pieces. To set the dyes, dip the fabric in a mordant before the dye.
