These two terms, when multiplied together, produce your quadratic equation - in other words, they are your quadratic equation's factors.

Factoring Quadratic Equations Ensure the equation is in quadratic form (ax + bx + c = 0). Quadratic equations are of the form ax + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are numeric constants and a does not equal 0 (note that a can equal 1 or -1). If you have an equation containing one variable (x) that has one or more terms of x to the second power, you can usually shift the terms in the equation around using basic algebraic operations to get 0 on one side of equals sign and ax, etc. on the other side. For example, let's consider the algebraic equation. 5x + 7x - 9 = 4x + x - 18 can be simplified to x + 6x + 9 = 0, which is in the quadratic form. Equations with greater powers of x, like x, x, etc. can't be quadratic equations. They are cubic equations, quadratic equations, and so on, unless the equation can be simplified to eliminate these terms of x above the power of 2. In quadratic equations where a = 1, factor to (x+d )(x+e), where d \u00d7 e = c and d + e = b. If your quadratic equation it is in the form x + bx + c = 0 (in other words, if the coefficient of the x term = 1), it's possible (but not guaranteed) that a relatively simple shortcut can be used to factor the equation. Find two numbers that both multiply to make c and add to make b. Once you find these two numbers d and e, place them in the following expression: (x+d)(x+e).

Believe it or not, for uncomplicated quadratic equations, one of the accepted means of factoring is simply to examine the problem, then just consider possible answers until you find the right one. This is also known as factoring by inspection.

Solve by completing the square. In some cases, quadratic equations can be quickly and easily factored by using a special algebraic identity. Any quadratic equation of the form x + 2xh + h = (x + h). So, if, in your equation, your b value is twice the square root of your c value, your equation can be factored to (x + (sqrt(c))). For example, the equation x + 6x + 9 fits this form. 3 is 9 and 3 \u00d7 2 is 6. So, we know that the factored form of this equation is (x + 3)(x + 3), or (x + 3). Use factors to solve quadratic equations. Regardless of how you factor your quadratic expression, once it is factored, you can find possible answers for the value of x by setting each factor equal to zero and solving. Since you're looking for values of x that cause your equation to equal zero, a value of x that makes either of your factors equal zero is a possible answer for your quadratic equation. Let's return to the equation x + 5x + 6 = 0. This equation factored to (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0. If either of the factors equals 0, the entire equation equals 0, so our possible answers for x are the numbers that make (x + 3) and (x + 2) equal 0. These numbers are -3 and -2, respectively.

First, -2:\n(-2) + 5(-2) + 6 = 0\n4 + -10 + 6 = 0\n0 = 0. This is correct, so -2 is a valid answer. Now, let's try -3:\n(-3) + 5(-3) + 6 = 0\n9 + -15 + 6 = 0\n0 = 0. This is also correct, so -3 is also a valid answer. Factoring Other Forms of Equations If the equation is in the form a-b, factor it to (a+b)(a-b). Equations with two variables factor differently than basic quadratics. For any equation a-b where a and b do not equal 0, the equation factors to (a+b)(a-b). For example, the equation 9x - 4y = (3x + 2y)(3x - 2y). If the equation is in the form a+2ab+b, factor it to (a+b). Note that, If the trinomial is in the form a-2ab+b, the factored form is slightly different: (a-b). The equation 4x + 8xy + 4y can be re-written as 4x + (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2)xy + 4y. We can now see that it's in the correct form, so we can say with confidence that our equation factors to (2x + 2y) If the equation is in the form a-b, factor it to (a-b)(a+ab+b). Finally, it bears mentioning that cubics and even higher-order equations can be factored, though the factoring process quickly becomes prohibitively complicated. For instance, 8x - 27y factors to (2x - 3y)(4x + ((2x)(3y)) + 9y)",

        "3 and 2 multiply together to make 6 and also add up to make 5, so we can simplify this equation to (x + 3)(x + 2).",
        "Slight variations on this basic shortcut exist for slight variations in the equation itself:\nIf the quadratic equation is in the form x-bx+c, your answer is in this form: (x - _)(x - _).",
        "If it is in the form x+bx+c, your answer looks like this: (x + _)(x + _).",
        "If it is in the form x-bx-c, you answer is in the form (x + _)(x - _).",
        "Note: the numbers in the blanks can be fractions or decimals.",
        "For example, the equation x + (21/2)x + 5 = 0 factors to (x + 10)(x + 1/2).",
        "If possible, factor by inspection.",
        "Believe it or not, for uncomplicated quadratic equations, one of the accepted means of factoring is simply to examine the problem, then just consider possible answers until you find the right one.",
        "This is also known as factoring by inspection.",
        "If the equation is in the form ax+bx+c and a>1, your factored answer will be in the form (dx +/- _)(ex +/- _), where d and e are nonzero numerical constants that multiply to make a.",
        "Either d or e (or both) can be the number 1, though this is not necessarily so.",
        "If both are 1, you've essentially used the shortcut described above.",
        "Let's consider an example problem.",
        "3x - 8x + 4 at first seems intimidating.",
        "However, once we realize that 3 only has two factors (3 and 1), it becomes easier, because we know that our answer must be in the form (3x +/- _)(x +/- _).",
        "In this case, adding a -2 to both blank spaces gives the correct answer.",
        "-2 \u00d7 3x = -6x and -2 \u00d7 x = -2x.",
        "-6x and -2x add to -8x.",
        "-2 \u00d7 -2 = 4, so we can see that the factored terms in parentheses multiply to become the original equation.",
        "Solve by completing the square.",
        "In some cases, quadratic equations can be quickly and easily factored by using a special algebraic identity.",
        "Any quadratic equation of the form x + 2xh + h = (x + h).",
        "So, if, in your equation, your b value is twice the square root of your c value, your equation can be factored to (x + (sqrt(c))).",
        "For example, the equation x + 6x + 9 fits this form.",
        "3 is 9 and 3 \u00d7 2 is 6.",
        "So, we know that the factored form of this equation is (x + 3)(x + 3), or (x + 3).",
        "Use factors to solve quadratic equations.",
        "Regardless of how you factor your quadratic expression, once it is factored, you can find possible answers for the value of x by setting each factor equal to zero and solving.",
        "Since you're looking for values of x that cause your equation to equal zero, a value of x that makes either of your factors equal zero is a possible answer for your quadratic equation.",
        "Let's return to the equation x + 5x + 6 = 0.",
        "This equation factored to (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0.",
        "If either of the factors equals 0, the entire equation equals 0, so our possible answers for x are the numbers that make (x + 3) and (x + 2) equal 0.",
        "These numbers are -3 and -2, respectively.",
        "Check your answers - some of them may be extraneous!",
        "When you've found your possible answers for x, plug them back in to your original equation to see if they are valid.",
        "Sometimes, the answers you find don't cause the original equation to equal zero when plugged back in.",
        "We call these answers extraneous and disregard them.",
        "Let's plug -2 and -3 into  x + 5x + 6 = 0.",
        "First, -2:\n(-2) + 5(-2) + 6 = 0\n4 + -10 + 6 = 0\n0 = 0.",
        "This is correct, so -2 is a valid answer.",
        "Now, let's try -3:\n(-3) + 5(-3) + 6 = 0\n9 + -15 + 6 = 0\n0 = 0.",
        "This is also correct, so -3 is also a valid answer.",
        "Factoring Other Forms of Equations If the equation is in the form a-b, factor it to (a+b)(a-b).",
        "Equations with two variables factor differently than basic quadratics.",
        "For any equation a-b where a and b do not equal 0, the equation factors to (a+b)(a-b).",
        "For example, the equation 9x - 4y = (3x + 2y)(3x - 2y).",
        "If the equation is in the form a+2ab+b, factor it to (a+b).",
        "Note that, If the trinomial is in the form a-2ab+b, the factored form is slightly different: (a-b).",
        "The equation 4x + 8xy + 4y can be re-written as 4x + (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2)xy + 4y.",
        "We can now see that it's in the correct form, so we can say with confidence that our equation factors to (2x + 2y) If the equation is in the form a-b, factor it to (a-b)(a+ab+b).",
        "Finally, it bears mentioning that cubics and even higher-order equations can be factored, though the factoring process quickly becomes prohibitively complicated.",
        "For instance, 8x - 27y factors to (2x - 3y)(4x + ((2x)(3y)) + 9y)"
