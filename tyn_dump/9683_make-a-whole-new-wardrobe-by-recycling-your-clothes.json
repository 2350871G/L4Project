Usually second-hand stores give you the option of receiving cash or in-store credit for your items that sell.

If you bring in clothes to consign every time you visit the store, you will most likely have credit the next time you come in, and can establish a monthly or bi-monthly wardrobe rotation without spending any money. You can also start clothing swaps with your friends. Often the clothes that no longer interest you can feel 'new' for someone else."
