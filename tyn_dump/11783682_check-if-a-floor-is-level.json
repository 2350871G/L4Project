Checking with a Laser Level Get a tall piece of wood with a straight-cut short end to make markings on.

Stand near 1 edge of the floor and hold your piece of wood up straight next to you. Position it so that the broadest side is facing the laser.Ensure that the short end of the wood is completely flat on the floor. Set the laser level to 6 in (15 cm) lower than the height of the wood. Adjust the height so the laser is approximately 6 in (15 cm) lower than the piece of wood you are going to make markings on. This will give you plenty of room to make markings higher than the laser if the floor is uneven in places. Make a mark where the laser hits on the wood using a pencil. Look at the front of the piece of wood for the red line from the laser. Carefully trace over it with a pencil to make a straight mark on the piece of wood. This shows you the distance between the floor in that spot and where the laser hits. Mark the laser\u2019s height on the wood all the way around the room. Move to each side of the room and make a mark where the laser beam hits the face of the wood. This will show you whether other parts of the room are higher or lower than the first spot you marked.Tip: If you\u2019re working on an unfinished floor, such as a concrete floor, and certain spots turn out to be higher or lower, you can write \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d on the floor in those spots to keep track of them and level the floor later on.
