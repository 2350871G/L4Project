Use a ruler to make sure all of the edges are straight. For example, if your shoulder width is 18 inches, the paper should be 12 inches by 9 inches. Tissue paper is good to use for this because it usually comes in large sheets and it is easy to fold and cut. Be gentle with it so you don\u2019t rip it."
