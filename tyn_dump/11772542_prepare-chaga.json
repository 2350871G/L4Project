Check with your doctor about how different medications react with chaga tea. Chaga tea may help to lower your blood sugar and boost your immune system. Making Tinctures with Dried Chunks Put a handful of chaga chunks at the bottom of a pot. Take about 20 pieces of chaga chunks and place them in a wide, deep pot. Make sure they are all completely dry and don\u2019t have any moisture left in them. You can tell your chaga pieces are dry by seeing if they crumble when you squeeze them. Fill the pot with 0.5 litres (17  fl oz) of water and boil it. Turn your stovetop to high heat and wait 5 to 10 minutes for large bubbles to appear in the water. If the water starts to boil over, turn down the heat slightly. Simmer the water and chaga for 30 minutes. Turn your stovetop to medium heat and allow your mixture to simmer. If it starts to boil again, turn down the heat until there are only small bubbles at the top of your liquid. Simmering your mixture allows the nutritional benefits of the chaga to leach out into the water. Cool the chaga and water and pour it into a jar. Take your pot off the stovetop and allow it to cool for 10 to 20 minutes until it gets to room temperature. Use a funnel to pour your mixture into a large jar with a lid that can hold about double the amount of liquid that you are pouring. Make sure your mixture is completely cool so that you don\u2019t shatter the glass jar. Add 0.5 litres (17  fl oz) of vodka to the jar. Make sure the vodka is at least 40% alcohol. Use a funnel to fill up the jar and add as much vodka as there is water. If you don\u2019t have vodka, you can use rum instead. Store the mixture in a dark place for 1 week. Choose a kitchen cabinet, pantry, or your basement to keep the mixture of chaga, water, and alcohol. Make sure it doesn\u2019t get above 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C). Letting the mixture sit makes the chaga dissolve more. Strain out the chaga chunks before you use the tincture. Pour the mixture through a strainer and catch the liquid that comes out in a jar with a lid. Throw away the chaga chunks and use your tincture as a supplement that you can take once a week.Tip: You can take 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the chaga tincture per week to potentially boost your immune system and lower your blood pressure. Use your chaga tincture within 8 weeks. The benefits of the chaga will only stick around for so long. Keep your chaga tincture in an airtight jar with the lid closed for 2 months and try to use it all before then.
