                    "description": "For small groups of bubbles, you can use a palm sander and 60-grit sandpaper. For larger bubble clusters, it may be easier to use a floor buffer. Locate the area of your floor with bubbles, and place the sander over top for 5-15 seconds. Move on to the next area until all bubbles are sanded. Palm sanders cost $14 a day (\u00a39.94) or $56 (\u00a339.76) a week to rent. You can rent a floor buffer for about $33 a day (\u00a323.43) or $120 a week (\u00a385.19). Sanding over your floor scratches up the bubbles, making it easy to apply a fresh coat of epoxy."

Turn it on and select the medium or hard blasting option. Then, start at the edge of your floor, and pull the trigger to release the sand. Walk your blaster in a straight line across your floor, and continue until all of your epoxy is removed. The sand blaster shoots finely ground silica at your floor very quickly, and this removes any unwanted substance from your floor. You will need to rent an air compressor as well as the blaster and purchase sand to use. In total, this will cost about $100 (\u00a370.96 for the day). Make sure your sand blaster is full of silica, and fill up the holding tank if needed."

        "The main reason your floor peeled up is due to inadequate preparation of the concrete below your epoxy.",
        "The concrete must be correctly prepared so the epoxy sticks to the concrete completely.",
        "To help with this, it may be easier to hire a professional who can clean and sand your concrete for you.",

        "Use a floor buffer and 100-grit sandpaper if replacing most of your floor.",
        "For larger floor repairs, you can get the job done quicker if you use a floor buffer rather than palm sander.",
        "Start on an outer edge of your floor, and walk your floor buffer slowly until you reach the far side.",

        "To check the application of your top coat, lean down over top of your flooring and look for any areas that are not shiny and wet.",
        "Because the top coat is clear, it may be difficult to see if your application is even.",
        "If you can, apply a third layer of top coat for best results.",
