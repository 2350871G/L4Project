Seek medical attention immediately. Put an ice pack on the area on the way to your doctor. Severe swelling, such a when your joint appears twice its size or feels hot to the touch, or pain in the area can also mean you have a serious sprain that should be treated by a doctor. Compare your injured joint to your non-injured joint to determine how badly it's swollen. If you have a fever or any open cuts around the injury, see a doctor immediately to rule out a broken bone and prevent infection. The doctor can do an X-ray or MRI to determine the extent of your injury. If you notice redness and heat around the injury, it may be a sign of infection. Contact your doctor immediately. If the same joint has been sprained or injured before, it\u2019s best to see a doctor even if it seems like you have a minor sprain. Your doctor can help you avoid any complications with your current injury and prevent it from happening again in the future."

After this period, and once the swelling has gone down, you can start gently using the injured joint again.

Sitting in a sauna or steam room for 15-20 minutes is also a great way to give your injury some heat therapy.

If you have a moderate or severe sprain, it\u2019s best to consult with your doctor or physiotherapist to come up with the right rehabilitation exercises to rebuild strength and stability in the joint.
