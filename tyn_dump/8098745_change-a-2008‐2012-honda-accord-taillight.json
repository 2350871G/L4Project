Use the flat-head screwdriver to remove the 2 bumper clips under the bumper.  Open the trunk lid and use the flat-head screwdriver to remove the 2 silver clips covering the 10mm screws. After that, remove the 2 10mm screws from both sides of the bumper using the 10mm socket wrench. Place the masking tape above the gap between the quarter panel and rear bumper for both sides. This will help prevent any scratches and/or chips when removing the bumper. Use one hand to push up from underneath the bumper while the other hand pulls the top of the bumper towards you. Repeat this process slowly making your way from the start of either side, to the middle, and to the other side of the bumper. Once the bumper is fully removed from the frame of the car, place it on a safe, clean area. You can, for example, place the bumper on two foldable chairs. Removing the Taillight Go into the trunk to remove the lining on the side of the taillight that is being replaced. Take the flat-head screwdriver and remove the 2 fasteners that are holding the lining in place. Take the 8mm socket wrench and remove the 4 8mm screws from the taillight assembly.  After removing the screws, remove the wiring harness that includes the brake light, turn signal, and reverse light. This can be done by twisting the sockets counter-clockwise for all three lights. Use the 10mm socket wrench to remove the 2 10mm screws on the little frame piece that holds on the taillight assembly and supports the bumper. Use the phillips screwdriver to remove a screw on the little frame piece. If you are not able to remove these screws due to excessive rust, spraying WD-40 on the screws is recommended as it will loosen them a bit. Place the masking tape above the gap between the quarter panel and the taillight assembly to help prevent any scratches and/or chips when removing the taillight.

Check your work so far. Before finishing the entire process, it is a good idea to check if all of the lights are working properly. If all three lights are working properly, proceed to the next step.

Reattaching the Bumper Put the lining back on its place and insert the 2 fasteners that holds it.  Take the bumper and place it on the frame of the car. Start on the middle of the bumper and making your way on both sides of the bumper; make sure to push firmly with both your hands. You will hear clicks as you are pushing the bumper, which shows that it is clipping onto the frame correctly. Insert the 2 10mm screws on both sides of the bumper using the 10mm socket wrench. Then, put on the 2 silver clips on both sides. After that, take the flat-head screwdriver to insert the 2 bumper clips under the bumper. Lastly, screw in the 6 screws with a phillips screwdriver on the corners of both sides of the bumper. Remove the masking tape from the car slowly. Remove any clear plastic from the new taillight, if any. Check to see if all the lights are working properly once again. Then enjoy your new taillight!",
