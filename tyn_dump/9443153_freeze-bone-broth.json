Write the date on a piece of tape and stick it on the container so you\u2019ll know how long the broth has been in the freezer for. Your bone broth should last for up to a year in the freezer. Wash out the ice cube tray you used with soap and water before you freeze water in it again. Thaw your frozen cubes of bone broth in a pot or pan on a stovetop. Each cube should contain about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of bone broth. If you\u2019re making something that calls for bone broth, add a couple cubes to the dish while it\u2019s cooking. If you want to thaw the bone broth by itself, set the cubes in an empty pot or pan over medium heat on the stovetop Freezing in Plastic Bags Place an open, sealable plastic bag inside of a cup. You can use a coffee mug or a regular drinking class. Just make sure the cup and the plastic bag you\u2019re using are about the same height. Tuck the bag into the cup so the open part of the bag is at the top. Then, fold the top, sealable edges of the bag over the rim of the cup. Pour your bone broth into the bag in the cup. Use a measuring cup to measure how much broth you're putting in the bag. Use an amount of broth commonly called for in recipes, like 1 cup (240 mL). Remove and seal the plastic bag. Carefully unfold the sealable part of the bag from around the rim of the cup. Then, seal the bag and lift it out of the cup. Set the bag aside while you bag up the rest of the broth. Write the amount of broth that's in the bag on the outside of the bag so you know how much you need to defrost later on. Pour the rest of the bone broth into bags using the same method. Add a fresh plastic bag to the cup the same way you did the first one. After you fill it with broth, seal and remove it from the cup. Continue until all of your broth is bagged. Lay the bags of bone broth flat on a metal tray. Use a tray with raised edges in case one of the bags breaks in the freezer. It\u2019s OK to overlap the bags and stack them on top of each other. Freeze the bags of bone broth on the tray overnight. Freezing the bags on a tray first will protect your freezer in case one of the bags leaks. Wait until the bags are frozen solid before you remove them from the tray. Take the bags of broth off the tray and store them in the freezer for up to a year. Stack the bags of broth in the freezer so they take up less room. Write the date on each bag of broth so you can keep track of how long they\u2019ve been in the freezer. Remove the broth from the bag by running it under cold water. Once the bag is slightly defrosted, use your hands or a knife to break up the frozen block of broth. Then, empty the broth from the bag into a pot or pan for cooking. Freezing in Jars Divide your bone broth into multiple glass jars. Make sure you\u2019re using glass jars that come with lids. Pour the broth into the jars, or use a ladle to scoop it in. Fill the jars up so there\u2019s at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the top of the broth and the top of the jar. That way the broth will have space to expand when it freezes. Measure how much broth you're putting in the jars with a measuring cup and write the amount on the outside of the jars so you don't forget. Chill the sealed jars of broth in the fridge overnight.

Acclimating them to colder temperatures in the fridge first can help prevent breaking. Transfer the jars of broth to the freezer. Organize the jars so they\u2019re each sitting flat on the bottom of the freezer, or place them in the freezer door. Don\u2019t stack the jars on top of each other or one could fall over and break. You can store your jars of bone broth in the freezer for up to a year. Thaw the jars of broth in the fridge or in a bowl of warm water.
