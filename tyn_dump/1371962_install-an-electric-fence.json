Consider the number of animals you need to control and determine the spacing and number of wires you need to use to install electric fencing. If you've got a particular plot set aside for your electric enclosure, take careful measurements and decide on an appropriate height for your fence. Decide on the length of each run, as well as the height and the number of wires necessary to complete the job. Price the wires per foot at your retailer to get the best deal possible. Different chargers are optimized for different lengths of wire. Check with your supplier to make sure that the charger you intend to get will work with the planned length of wire for your enclosure."

Solar charges do not need an electric outlet but they require a certain amount of sunlight, which can be an effective and energy-efficient option in your area. Electric chargers must have access to an AC outlet. Don't buy chargers with foot or mile power ratings, instead select a charger that's rated by joules. A higher rating in terms of joules doesn't mean that the charge will be stronger if an animal gets jolted, it just means that the electrical current will be more consistent, making a high-joule charger the smartest purchase. If you've got a five acre fence, you'll need at least a joule at the minimum."

Tape is the easiest to see, and less dangerous than straight wire. Making sure that the fencing is easy to see is one of the most important considerations. 1.5- or 2-inch poly tape, braid, rope are perfectly effective for most purposes. Coated wire is likewise easy to see and to install. Half inch tape is probably too small for a more substantial fence, especially for horses or keeping deer out."

Never just wrap the wire around the fence posts, because the cable will come loose more easily and corrosion can occur. Use the connector clamps provided by the manufacturer.

There are a variety of methods for doing this: you could install a self-locking ratchet-style wire tensioner, use a come-along cable puller, or install a turnbuckle cable tensioner.
