Round face: The best hairstyle for round faces definitely has to be long length, long layers, and a long fringe, hair parted down the side. If you have the length already, get to the hairdressers and add some face shaping, wispy layers - you will be surprised at how much difference this can make to your style. Oval face: There isn't \"one\" best hairstyle for oval shaped faces - there are many! Lucky for you, you suit almost any hairstyle, as long as it doesn't hide your features, and is styled correctly. If your hair is short at the moment, and you feel you have the willpower, then grow your hair out. Experiment with angled and long, wispy fringes or layers, while its growing, to give your style new looks. This will also stop you from getting bored and having it cut short again. Heart face: The best hairstyles that will do wonders for you heart shaped faces will include the following: Side parts, long, soft layers, a soft side sweeping fringe, highlights/low lights, long, full waves and curls minus the frizz. Just remember, you need to create volume around the bottom of your face, and make it soft and sleek at the top, to balance out your face shape and show off your features! Square face: Hairstyles that have long, soft layers towards the top of the head are an instant disguise for a square jaw. Soften your square face with waves and curls, which will also add some femininity to your style. Whether you opt for a long or short style, remember not to go too short or too long. A couple of inches below or above the chin is perfect. Add a sweeping side fringe to soften your wide forehead, and you will look fabulous. Diamond face: Most hairstyles would look complimentary on you, but hairstyles that would look great on you are ones with side parts and/or layers."

Eyeliner is great! It defines your eyes, and makes them pop! Try to stick to a brown eyeliner. Black is dramatic, but brown gives you a more subtle, natural look. Use mascara. Mascara make your eyes look awesome, but be careful, it can also become very smudgy or clumpy, and completely ruin the look. Use a clear mascara, as it clumps less, and doesn't smudge noticeably.

Don't wear lipstick, as it would make you look older than you are.
