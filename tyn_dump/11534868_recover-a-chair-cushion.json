Slide your screwdriver under the staple and move the handle up to pop each staple off. If you\u2019re using a staple remover, wrap the jaws around each staple and pull it off. Pry every staple out and pull the fabric cover up to remove it. If you notice that the interior cushion is made out of loose stuffing, consider simply covering over the old fabric to make things easier. If you do want to replace the stuffing, buy a foam pad for a cushion online or at a local craft store. You can also buy loose cotton stuffing and pat it down while you wrap the fabric around it. You can use a staple removing tool if you prefer, but the staples that go into cushions tend to be a little too strong for a standard staple remover. You don\u2019t need to remove the old cover if you don\u2019t want to. You can always add a new layer of fabric on top of your old cushion."
