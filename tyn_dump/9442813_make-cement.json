Gerber Ortiz-Vega\t\t\tMasonry Specialist\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: If you're working on a project where you'll have a concrete finish, measure out 3 parts concrete, then add 1 part water.

If you purchased cement without sand already mixed in, add 3 or 4 shovels-full of sand to the soupy concrete mixture, then stir until the sand has been worked in. The technically correct ratio of mixing cement with sand is 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, and 3 parts water. However, you can customize this ratio as you see fit. For most projects, you won\u2019t need 3 times as much sand as cement. Start with a 1:1 ratio instead. If you\u2019re planning to add aggregate to your concrete mixture, add the aggregate now as well. Add sand and aggregate separately to ensure that each gets fully mixed into the wet concrete."

        "Large hardware stores and home-supply stores (such as Lowe\u2019s or Home Depot) will stock a large variety of cement types.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re setting gate posts, purchase an anchoring cement.",
        "If you\u2019re laying a patio or a driveway, opt for a fiber reinforced cement.",
        "If you are using the cement for a variety of projects or are not familiar with using cement, purchase either a regular (multi-purpose) or fast-setting mix (like Quikrete).",
        "Consult the sales staff at the hardware store for additional help selecting a type of cement or concrete.",
        "Purchase cement with aggregate if you\u2019re laying thicker concrete.",
        "If you are laying a single layer of concrete that will be thicker than \u20444 inch (1.9 cm)\u2014such as a building foundation or driveway\u2014purchase cement with aggregate mixed in.",
        "Aggregate is stones and gravel added to the cement mixture to make it stronger and less likely to crack.",
        "If you prefer not to buy cement with aggregate already included, you can also purchase gravel at a hardware store and add this into the aggregate-free cement later.",
        "Put on two layers of hand protection.",
        "Cement is messy, and it will likely get all over your hands.",
        "If cement contacts your skin directly, brush it off immediately.",
        "To protect your hands, first put on a pair of latex gloves.",
        "Then, over these, put on a pair of sturdy work gloves.",
        "To protect your eyes, you should also always wear a pair of safety goggles when working with cement.",
        "Since cement will harm your lungs, think about wearing a surgeon\u2019s mask or bandana over your mouth when pouring dry cement.",
        "Cut open the bag of cement and empty the contents in a wheelbarrow.",
        "Use the blade of your shovel to stab an opening in the bag near one end.",
        "Then grab the cement bag firmly by the other end, and upend it so the powder spills out into the wheelbarrow.",
        "If you prefer to use a machine mixer rather than mixing by hand, you\u2019ll pour the opened bag of cement into the machine basin.",
        "Avoid shaking the bag as your pour out the cement powder.",
        "It\u2019s very dusty, and shaking the bag will fill the air with cement powder.",
        "Add water to the cement powder.",
        "Using a garden hose, add a reasonable amount of water to the center of the dry cement powder.",
        "Start by adding about 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.",
        "It\u2019s best to start out with a smaller amount of water and add more as needed\u2014it\u2019s inconvenient to add a second bag of cement if you add to much water to the first batch.",
        "If you\u2019re mixing multiple bags of cement, you\u2019ll quickly get the hang of how much water is necessary.",

        "Gerber specializes in providing brick and stone laying services, concrete installations, and masonry repairs.",
        "Gerber has over four years of experience running GO Masonry and over ten years of general masonry work experience.",
        "He earned a BA in Marketing from the University of Mary Washington in 2017.",
        "Gerber Ortiz-Vega\t\t\tMasonry Specialist\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: If you're working on a project where you'll have a concrete finish, measure out 3 parts concrete, then add 1 part water.",
        "If you're making a concrete foundation for a retaining wall or a post, the concrete can be a little more wet, because the finish won't matter as much.",
        "Mix the water into the cement powder.",
        "Use your shovel to stir the water into the dry powder.",
        "Pull the dry cement mix from the outer edge of the wheelbarrow into the wet center, and stir until there is no dry powder left in the wheelbarrow.",
        "Ideally, the cement should be a little runny at this point, about the consistency of thin putty.",
        "Stir slowly, so that the water doesn\u2019t slosh over the sides of the wheelbarrow.",
        "If you\u2019re using the mixing machine, simply flip the \u201cOn\u201d switch and let the machine stir for you.",
        "Add a shovel-full of sand if required.",
        "Most fast-setting bags of concrete mix will already contain sand, so you won\u2019t need to add any.",
        "If you purchased cement without sand already mixed in, add 3 or 4 shovels-full of sand to the soupy concrete mixture, then stir until the sand has been worked in.",
        "The technically correct ratio of mixing cement with sand is 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, and 3 parts water.",
        "However, you can customize this ratio as you see fit.",
        "For most projects, you won\u2019t need 3 times as much sand as cement.",
        "Start with a 1:1 ratio instead.",
        "If you\u2019re planning to add aggregate to your concrete mixture, add the aggregate now as well.",
        "Add sand and aggregate separately to ensure that each gets fully mixed into the wet concrete.",
        "Making \u201cSurvival Cement\u201d From Mud and Grass Gather thick, clay-rich mud.",
        "If you are located near a river, lake, or other body of water, you can gather mud from its banks.",
        "Otherwise, you may need to make your own mud by digging up clay-rich soil and adding water to it.",
        "The clay should be a thin consistency so that it will mix well with dry grass.",
        "A clay-rich mud or soil will result in a strong, durable cement.",
        "Gather an armload of dry grass.",
        "Walk to a nearby field or riverbank and pull up a large armload of old, dead grass.",
        "You\u2019ll use this to mix with the mud.",
        "Green grass will not work.",
        "The grass needs to be dry and hard in order to make suitable survival cement.",
        "Cut the grass to a usable length.",
        "The grass that you\u2019ve harvested will probably be very long, which will prevent it from mixing well with the cement.",
        "Solve this problem by using a field knife to cut the grass down into a suitable length.",
        "It will be most convenient if you do this on top of a large tarp.",
        "For most projects, the grass will work best when cut into sections between 6 inches (15 cm) and 12 inches (30 cm).",
        "Pour the mud out on the tarp.",
        "Do this near the location where you\u2019ve set the cut grass stalks.",
        "Once the mud is on the tarp, set about half of the grass on top of the mud.",
        "Stomp the mud and grass together.",
        "Either wearing shoes that you don\u2019t mind getting muddy, or barefoot, step up and down on top of the mud and grass mixture until the two elements have been fully smashed together.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to get your shoes or feet dirty, fold a corner of the tarp on top of the mud and grass and stomp on top of that.",
        "Roll the mud and grass back on itself.",
        "At this point, the mud and grass will be smashed into a flat layer.",
        "Pick up one edge of the tarp, and lift until the mud/grass mixture folds back over itself.",
        "Do this a couple of times, until the mixture is roughly in a round shape.",
        "Add the rest of the grass and stomp again.",
        "Place the remaining half of the dry grass stalks on top of the mud and grass mixture.",
        "Walk in place on top of the mixture, using the same technique as before.",
        "This will force all of the newly-added grass to fully blend with the mud/grass mixture, leaving you with well-blended survival cement.",
        "At this point, your survival cement is finished.",
        "Begin shaping and working with it immediately, as the mud will dry quickly.",
        "You can form your batch of survival cement into a series of bricks, which can be built into a small hut in adverse survival conditions.",
        "In non-survival situations, you could use these cement bricks to build a retaining wall or fire pit."
