These systems help reduce crime in the community as well as foster a sense of pride and safety for neighborhood residents. Neighborhood watch systems are about more than simply catching or deterring criminals. For example, if your group of neighborhood watch volunteers is out for a routine patrol, they might notice a lost child or pet and help get them home. Or, they might notice smoke coming from a window of a home and alert the fire department. Many police departments are happy to offering training or conduct a meeting with neighborhood watch groups to offer tips and training. Contact your local police station to see if they offer these services.

        "Make sure the community appears well-maintained.",
        "It\u2019s difficult to take pride in your community if it looks run-down.",
        "As much as possible, work to maintain and improve the appearance of your community.",
        "Encourage residents to maintain the exteriors of their homes and complete routine lawn maintenance.",
        "Develop community green spaces like parks or gardens, if possible, as these are great crime deterrents.",
        "A great way to improve and invest in your community is to Start a Community Garden.",
        "Community gardens have been shown to increase neighborhood property values and build a sense of community among participating gardeners.",
        "They also deter crime by reducing the number of abandoned vacant lots.",
        "Speak with your city or district council about community safety measures.",
        "Sometimes neighborhood maintenance goes beyond what residents can do for themselves.",
        "At this point, it\u2019s appropriate to involve city or district council member to discuss how to implement community safety measures.",
        "For example, if your neighborhood has poor lighting, this is a safety hazard on multiple levels because criminals feel safer committing crimes in the dark, and residents out walking in the evening might not be seen and could be struck by passing vehicles.",
        "The city will have to install better lighting because it\u2019s a major improvement project not suitable for individual residents to do themselves.",
        "Request community improvements formally.",
        "Attend city council meetings and bring a formal list of requests with you or your community's representatives.",
        "Having your requests in writing gives your local city governance something concrete to work with.",
        "Be sure to detail the ways in which your requests will better your community by making it safer, both in terms of accessibility and decreases in crime.",
        "Depending on your community\u2019s needs, examples of community improvements that your neighborhood might request from local officials include the repair or creation of well-marked bike paths, youth centers, or accessible and safe playgrounds for neighborhood children to use.",
        "Doing Your Part For Your Home Invest in a home security system.",
        "These systems deter break-ins and crime because they offer a direct line to emergency services from inside your home, whether you are home or away.",
        "If burglars notice that your home is equipped with a home security system, they might pass on your house and move on to an easier target.",
        "Only share your home security code with individuals whom you absolutely trust.",
        "If you think someone untrustworthy has obtained the code, change it as soon as possible.",
        "Choose a home security system with a lighted motion sensor.",
        "When these systems detect movement, they turn on flood lighting, making it easy to see what or who is approaching your home.",
        "Some home security systems involve cameras.",
        "Be sure to invest in a high definition camera, so that if your home is ever burglarized and the cameras capture photos or video of the perpetrator, the images will be clear enough to give a good picture of the burglar.",
        "Don\u2019t give burglars the opportunity to hide or lurk outside your home.",
        "Keep bushes and shrubbery trimmed and leave your porch light on, if possible.",
        "You want your home to be as uninviting to criminals as you can make it.",
        "Install window coverings for privacy.",
        "While everyone loves a bright, airy space, window coverings are important to install so that your belongings aren\u2019t on display for potential burglars.",
        "It\u2019s especially important to keep your window coverings closed at night when it\u2019s easiest for prowlers to look into your home for things they might want to steal when you\u2019re gone.",
        "Lock your doors and windows.",
        "This is a basic but very important safety precaution.",
        "Before you leave your home or go to bed for the night be sure that all your doors and windows are locked, including your garage door, if you have one.",
        "This applies to your car, as well.",
        "Be sure that all your windows are closed and any valuables are out of sight or locked in the trunk.",
        "Install timers on your lights and TV.",
        "Timers help you control when your lights and TV turn on and off when you aren\u2019t home.",
        "This gives the illusion of someone being home and can help deter potential home break-ins.",
        "Many timers can be programmed remotely with your cellphone and some even have a battery backup in case of a power failure.",
        "Remove your name from your home\u2019s exterior.",
        "Offering personal information on your mailbox or exterior of your home invites stalkers and burglars to learn who lives at your address.",
        "For safety and anonymity do not advertise your name on the exterior of your home.",
        "Let your neighbors know when you\u2019ll be out of town.",
        "If they keep an eye on your home while you\u2019re gone, ask them to watch for any suspicious activity.",
        "Authorize them to report any strange activity or suspicious individuals to police or the neighborhood watch group in your absence.",
        "If you\u2019ll be gone for more than a week, consider having the post office hold your mail and hire a teenager in the neighborhood to mow your lawn.",
        "An overgrown lawn with packages piling up at the front door is a dead giveaway to criminals that no one is home at your house.",
        "Make it a priority to have your home appear to have someone at home so that potential criminals will be deterred."
