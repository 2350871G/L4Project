                    "description": "If you spot a plant outdoors and don't have the first clue as to what it is, start identifying it by scanning your surroundings. In particular, consider the overall climate, the conditions of the terrain, and any nearby water sources. A quick glance should be able to tell you whether you're looking at a cattail reed or a cactus. Mosses, for instance, only grow on cool, moist surfaces, whereas woody shrubs tend to spring up in places where precipitation is scarce. Your location may also help point to the identity of larger clusters of trees making up wooded areas. You're more likely to find coniferous \"evergreens\" in cold, temperate climates, while the majority of trees in warm, humid regions are deciduous."

Most plants can be grouped and differentiated according to the appearance of these structures. As a general rule, you should always start by examining the plant's stem and branching pattern, then enlarge your focus to the leaves, flowers, shoots, and other outlying structures. Some of the broadest plant classifications include woody plants, herbaceous plants, aquatic plants, wildflowers, grasses, and lichens."
