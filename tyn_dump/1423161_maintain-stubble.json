Determining Your Ideal Stubble Length Stop shaving. Let your stubble grow to the point of being a short beard. As with a regular haircut, you can always take more off, but you can\u2019t put back what is no longer attached. Grow your beard to a length that you know is slightly longer than you\u2019d ever want to keep your stubble. How long this will take depends entirely on your particular beard growth. For some men this may take three or four days while for others it could be over a week. Use a long setting on your hair trimmer. Start with a slightly longer setting on your trimmer such as a 4. This will take all of your hair down to an even length. Especially for men with dark, thick beards, this setting will probably be too scruffy for the look they want, but it works for some\u2014think Hugh Jackman. Shorten in increments. Once you have an even length to work with, begin trimming your stubble down in increments to find the right length for you.
