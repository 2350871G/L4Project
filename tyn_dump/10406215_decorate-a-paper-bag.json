Depending on the wind you may need to repeat this process until your kite flies on its own. The ideal wind speed is when the leaves on the trees and bushes are moving gently. If they are moving rapidly, it is too windy to fly your kite. If the wind is too strong or it is storming do not go outside to fly your kite. Storms, especially electrical storms, can cause dangerous conditions to be outside in."

        "The slit size you make will vary depending on the thickness of your string.",
        "Monitor small children when allowing them to use scissors.",
        "Cut a piece of string so it is 18 to 24 in (46 to 61 cm) long.",

        "Once you feel the kite slightly pull away from you, let go and pull the string so that the kite is pointing towards the sky.",
        "This will help it climb as far as it can.",
        "Depending on the wind you may need to repeat this process until your kite flies on its own.",
        "The ideal wind speed is when the leaves on the trees and bushes are moving gently.",
        "If they are moving rapidly, it is too windy to fly your kite.",
        "If the wind is too strong or it is storming do not go outside to fly your kite.",
        "Storms, especially electrical storms, can cause dangerous conditions to be outside in."
