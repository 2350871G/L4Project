        "Make sure that you rinse the solution off thoroughly.",
        "If done properly, this will keep your fixtures shining between cleanings.",
        "Use Rain-X.",
        "This is a cleaning product that works by creating a barrier that repels water.",
        "Spray Rain-X directly onto your chrome fixtures and wipe away any excess.",
        "You can also moisten a microfiber cloth with Rain-X and apply it that way.",
        "With either method you should get at least a few weeks of protection from water drop spotting.",
        "Rub it with wax paper.",
        "Get a sheet of wax paper, fold it to expose the waxy side, and gently scrub the chrome.",
        "It may feel weird to polish a fixture with paper, but this really works.",
        "The wax will get lightly applied to the surface of your fixture and it will enhance the shine and help it to repel dust and dirt."
