Areas with delicate skin and coarse hair (like your bikini area or face) should be avoided if possible. Removing the coarse hair would require too much pressure and damage your skin. Maybe you'd get the hair off your upper lip with time, but you'd have a very red, irritated, possibly cut upper lip instead. Not a great trade-off. The pumice method works best on legs, arms, scalps (if you're bald and looking to get that shine), and shoulders. The pumice method is a good way to perform upkeep between waxing sessions. If you do plan to use the pumice on your face or bikini area, be extremely gentle. Consider other methods first, like waxing, tweezing, hair removal creams, or shaving. Do not use the pumice on skin that is already irritated, red, sunburned, broken, or peeling."
