Broiling Bacon-Wrapped Water Chestnuts Cut the chicken livers into 1/2 in (1.3 cm) pieces. Take \u20444 pound (110 g) of clean chicken livers and put them on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut the livers into 24 pieces that are about 1/2 in (1.3 cm) in size. Mix together the soy sauce, ginger, brown sugar, and curry powder. Pour \u20444 cup (59 ml) of soy sauce into a bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon (6 g) of finely grated peeled fresh ginger, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of packed light brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of curry powder. Stir until the spices dissolve. This will make the marinade for the chicken livers. Marinate the chicken livers for 1 hour. Stir the chopped chicken livers into the bowl with the marinade so they're coated with the mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the livers for 1 hour. Soak toothpicks in cold water for 1 hour. While the chicken livers marinate, soak 24 toothpicks in a bowl of cold water.

You'll need to use tongs to turn the water chestnuts once so they cook evenly. Remove and serve the water chestnuts. Turn off the broiler and remove the pan.
