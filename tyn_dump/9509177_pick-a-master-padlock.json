    "text": " Using Bobby Pins or Paperclips Make a lock pick and tension wrench with bobby pins. To make the tension wrench, bend the closed end of a bobby pin until it's at a 90-degree angle with the rest of the pin. To make the single-pin pick, unbend a bobby pin so it's straight. Then, bend the flat end of the bobby pin slightly upward. Make a pick and wrench out of paper clips if you don't have bobby pins. To make the tension wrench, take a paperclip and unbend all the loops except for one at the bottom. Then, bend the flat end of the paper clip until it makes a 90-degree angle with the rest of the paper clip. To make the single-pin pick, unbend half of a second paper clip. Bend the flat end of the paper clip so it goes slightly upward. Insert the bent end of your tension bar into the lock's keyhole. The tension bar will hold open the keyhole for you as you work on picking the lock. Rotate the tension wrench like you're opening the lock with the key. The tension wrench won't go very far because the lock is locked. Turn the wrench as far as it will go and hold it in place using the same hand you're holding the lock with. You want to maintain pressure on the tension wrench the whole time you're picking lock. Insert your single-pin pick into the lock and push it all the way back. Insert the pointed end of the pick into the lock and hold the handle end in your free hand. Push the pin at the back of the lock up with your pick.
