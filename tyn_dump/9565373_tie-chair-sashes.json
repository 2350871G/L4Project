        "Play around with the type of fabric.",
        "You can create different looks just by changing the material for your sash.",
        "For example, a rosette knot can give your chair a rustic look if you use a burlap or raw linen sash.",
        "Burlap and raw linen are great for a rustic barn-yard look.",
        "Use patterned scarves for a boho look.",
        "If you want something fancier, try chiffon, dupioni silk, lace, organza, satin, or tulle.",
        "Mix and match textures.",
        "Layer white or ivory lace over burlap for a boho-chic touch.",
        "Leave the tails hanging loose for a romantic look.",
        "If the sash is wired, like wired ribbon, you can fold the tails into ripples, or wrap them into coils.",
        "This will give your sashes some movement and make them look more interesting.",
        "Trim the ends of the tails if they are too long.",
        "Instead of just cutting them straight across, consider cutting them at an angle or into a dovetail.",
        "If the sash begins to fray, you can try singeing the cut ends with a flame or with a fray check.",
        "Fray check is a type of glue that you use to stop fabric from fraying.",
        "You can find it at a fabric store.",
        "Tuck the tails behind the sash for a streamlined look.",
        "This works great with all types of bows.",
        "Pull the tails behind the sash that is around the chair.",
        "The tension created by wrapping the sash in the first place should be enough to hold them in place."
