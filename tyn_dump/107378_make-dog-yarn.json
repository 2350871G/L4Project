Use a brush or mitt along the dog\u2019s back, sides, and soft, fluffy areas, and avoid areas like the legs and head. Discard any coarse hairs that you can see in the brush, since you won\u2019t be using them. Breeds like Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Malamute, Golden Retriever, Newfoundland, Collie, and Sheepdog are great for making dog yarn because they have fluffy undercoats with long fur."

Leave the bag open to allow air circulation, preventing mold and mildew. If you don\u2019t have a cotton bag, you can use a pillowcase or even a cardboard box for collecting the fur. Avoid using a plastic bag for collecting the fur since plastic can trap air and allow mold growth. Don\u2019t overfill the bag or push the fur down into the bag. Packing the fur too tightly can cause mold and mildew to form."

If you don\u2019t have enough fur, or your pet\u2019s fur is shorter than 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, you can use these different fibers to make a stronger, longer strand of yarn. If your dog doesn\u2019t produce a lot of fur, contact a groomer to see if you can use the excess fur from those dogs, or offer to brush a family member\u2019s dog or a friend\u2019s dog to gather additional fur. The wool and fur might be a slightly different texture, but that\u2019s okay. As long as you aren\u2019t using coarse hair, the fibers can be blended together through a process called carding."

        "If you have to put the yarn in a bag to store it, use a bag made of a breathable fabric, like cotton.",
        "Try to keep the yarn out of reach of pets, since they may still be able to smell some of their own scent on the fibers and might want to play with the bundles of yarn!"
