Label some boxes as Keep, Donate/Sell (whichever you want to do), and Belongs Elsewhere. Don't label all of them. Create an area to work in. This means your floor has to be clean! Put the things from your floor into a box/boxes. Go through the box!  Take ONE thing out of the box at a time. Ask yourself the following questions:\nHow often do I use this? Can I throw this away?

Cleaning Your Closet And Dresser Open a drawer to your dresser and take out the clothes you don't like. If you don't like certain clothes, why keep them? Take out clothes that you know are too small/big. If they are too small, you probably won't fit in them if you outgrew them. If they're a little big, keep them, but if they are way too big, get rid of them! If you don't know then try it on! Put the clothes you're keeping in a box. Fold them up and put them away neatly. If you do that, it'll be easier to get them organized later. Go to the closet and take out clothes you don't like. Just like with the dresser, why keep them? Take out clothes you outgrew, or are too big. Again, if you don't know then try it on. You may have shoes all over the bottom of your closet. Get rid of shoes too small, or way too big. Get rid of the uncomfortable ones as well. Put remaining things in boxes to keep. Take down the rest of your clothes, fold them up and put them in the boxes with the clothes from your dresser (if they'll fit). Cleaning Out The Storage Bins\\/Drawers Pick a bin/drawer to start with. If you only take on one at a time, it doesn't seem as big of a task. Sort through everything. Sort through everything the same way you sorted through the things on the floor. Ask yourself the same questions as well. Pick another bin/drawer, sort through everything, and ask yourself the same questions from before again.  Cleaning Off A Desk Put everything on the desk in a box.  Take one thing a time to go through. Do the same things you've done to everything else. Open the little drawers or compartments and go through those. Some desks have places to store things, and if you didn't go through them earlier, go through them now. Cleaning The Bookshelf or Shelves On The Wall Take the books off one by one. Ask yourself these questions for each book:\nHave I read it before? Will I be interested in it still? (If you haven't read it yet)\nWill I want to read it again? (If you've read it) Sort the knick-knacks and do-dads (the extra things you have). These things may include trophies, snow globes, and little glass figurines. They have to be sorted. Ask yourself these questions for each extra thing you have:\nDoes it look nice? Do I like it? Will it fit in with my new room? (if redecorating)",
