Keep in mind that this barrier likely won\u2019t prevent your skin from burning for more than a few seconds, so you still need to avoid aiming the gun at any part of your body! You can purchase heat-resistant work gloves at many hardware or building supply stores.

Keep the heat gun moving so you don\u2019t overheat the glass and crack it. Examine the wood for damage when you\u2019re done. Before you add the new glazing, repair damaged areas with wood epoxy and prime any bare wood with a shellac-based primer. Apply shrink wrap with a heat gun. Another one of the most popular uses for heat guns is to shrink plastic wrap. Wrap your item in special shrink-wrap plastic or place it in a shrinkable plastic bag, then go over the plastic with a heat gun until it shrinks into place. Keep the heat gun 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) away from the plastic wrap and move it continuously to avoid melting a hole in the plastic. If you use a shrinkable bag, tuck the opening shut and tape it, or tie it off at the top. Always use shrink-wrap plastic for this purpose. If you use regular plastic cling-wrap, it will burn or melt and release toxic fumes. Defrost frozen metal pipes. If metal water pipes in your home get frozen, a heat gun can help save your plumbing. Open up the valve at the end of the pipe, then carefully move the heat gun along the pipe to melt the ice and get the water flowing again. Take care not to overheat the pipes and turn the water into steam, or your pipes could burst. Use the heat gun on a low setting and don\u2019t hold it too close to the pipe. The pipe should never become too hot to touch with your bare hands. Don\u2019t use a heat gun on plastic pipes, since the plastic could easily melt or get singed even at relatively low temperatures. Incorporate your heat gun into arts and crafts projects. There are numerous ways a heat gun can come in handy when you\u2019re doing arts and crafts. For example, you can use a heat gun when you\u2019re embossing designs on a variety of surfaces, including paper, fabric, or even candles. You can also use the heat gun to:\nLoosen and re-stick embellishments or appliqu\u00e9s\nHeat Shrinky Dinks\nHeat and shape organza or silk fabric decorations",
