If you don\u2019t have an allen wrench, you could use a sturdy piece of wire bent into a 90-degree angle at one end. The reason allen wrenches work so well on skeleton key locks is that they have that 90-degree angle. Using something straight like a bobby pin or nail wouldn\u2019t work because they wouldn\u2019t be able to twist up to engage the lever and deadbolt."

A skeleton lock is made of two basic parts: a lever and a deadbolt. The lever sits on top of the deadbolt and moves up and down.
