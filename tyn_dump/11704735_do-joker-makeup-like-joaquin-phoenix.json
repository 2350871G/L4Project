You don\u2019t need a lot of face paint, so a few 0.5 oz (14 g) containers should be more than enough. To activate your paints, mist or sprinkle a little water on the surface of the powder or solid paint. Mix the damp surface of the paint around with a brush or sponge to activate it.Tip: The red and blue should be primary versions of the color, not tinted shades of maroon, navy blue, or teal. The white should be a pure, primary white, not cream or eggshell. The pre-activated and ready-to-use face paints tend to be fairly low quality. You can use them if you prefer, but you should use water-activated paints if you\u2019re going for an authentic look. You can buy face paints online or from an art supply store. You can get them at most costume shops too. They typically cost $5-15 depending on the brand you choose."

Then cover your entire face in a layer of white by dabbing and rubbing the sponge on your face. Work roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) inside of your hairline and stay inside of your cheekbones and chin. Close your eyes to dab paint over your eyelids. If you look closely, Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s makeup in the film isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s actually kind of blotchy and poorly applied. Do not worry about covering your face in a solid, opaque layer of paint. You\u2019re going to thin it out in the next step anyway.
