Consider buying or renting a telescope to \u201czoom in\u201d on the stars and simplify the process of locating the Little Dipper and other groupings and constellations. If a telescope is out of your price range, you might also invest in some binoculars. A strong pair of binoculars can increase your viewing power by up to 70%!
