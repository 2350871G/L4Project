Indica cannabis strains make the best and most effective Rick Simpson oils. When you've added all of your cannabis to the bucket, pour in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of isopropyl alcohol. Break up any larger chunks of cannabis with your wooden spoon before you add the isopropyl alcohol. Make sure your bucket can hold at least 2\u20133 gallons (7.6\u201311.4 l). Stir the cannabis and isopropyl alcohol thoroughly. Crush the cannabis with your wooden spoon after you've added the isopropyl alcohol. Continue stirring in circular motions for about 3 minutes or until most of the cannabis dissolves. At least 80% of the cannabis should dissolve into the mixture. Drain the solvent from the dissolved cannabis using a cheesecloth. Transfer the cannabis to a bowl and let it sit for about a minute. If no cheesecloths are available, coffee strainers can be used as a substitute. Stir the remaining cannabis and 1 US gal (3.8 l) of isopropyl alcohol together. Add 1 gallon (3.8 l) more of isopropyl alcohol to the bucket and stir the mixture until at least 80% of the cannabis has dissolved again. Save and store the drained alcohol in the bucket.

Pour your drained alcohol into the bucket with the rest of your solvent. Discard the leftover cannabis material after you've extracted the isopropyl alcohol.
