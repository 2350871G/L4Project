Pack your television by covering it with a cloth and securing with plastic wrap. Cover your television with an old blanket or cover. Take two Styrofoam blocks and cut a piece the width of your TV screen out of each. Place the blocks over the blanket or TV cover and secure by wrapping plastic wrap around the screen. Make sure to tape all cords to the base of the TV so they don't get in the way. Wrap your lamp in the newspaper. Remove the light bulb and lampshade from the base of the lamp and set aside. Wrap the cord around the base of the lamp and secure it with tape. Wrap the base of the lamp in newsprint and secure it with tape. Place the lamp in a box and place crumpled newsprint around the sides. To pack the lampshade, line the sides of a box with newsprint and place the shade in the box. Place crumpled newsprint under the shade to help it retain its shape. Wrap bar stools in bubble tape. Bar stools are generally pretty hard to take apart, so your best bet is to make sure they're protected for the move. Wrap the legs in bubble wrap and secure with packing tape. Cover fabric seats with plastic wrap to protect them. If your stools have removable cushions, remove them from the stools and pack them separately. Pack a baker's rack by covering it with blankets or pads. Before packing, empty your baker's rack. Move items such as dishes, food, and cookbooks separately. Wrap the empty rack in a blanket or pad and secure it with plastic wrap. Secure any doors with zip ties or rope. Cover filing cabinets with blankets. Empty your filing cabinets and pack the contents in a box. Make sure to keep important papers such as birth certificates and other legal documents with you during the move. After the drawers are empty, lock them to keep them from sliding. Cover the cabinet with a moving blanket or pad and secure with plastic wrap. Loading the Moving Truck Distribute weight evenly to make driving easier. If you load all of the heavy items on one side of the truck, it could make it difficult to steer the truck. Aim to spread the weight of your belongings evenly throughout the truck. Place the heaviest items against the walls. This will keep the middle of the space free for easier access and loading and unloading. Place pictures and mirrors between mattresses or other soft items. You've already carefully packaged your pictures and mirrors, but it won't hurt to give them an extra layer of protection. Slide pictures and mirrors between 2 mattresses to give them the greatest amount of padding. If you don't have more than 1 mattress, you could use the same trick with sofa cushions. Load couches vertically. Couches and loveseats can take up a lot of precious floor space. A great way to avoid that is to place the couch on its end (arm side) and make it vertical. This is especially helpful if you were unable to take your couch apart. Secure furniture with straps. Many rental moving trucks come with straps that you can use to tie down your belongings. When you pick up the truck, ask the agent if straps are included. Then ask for a brief demonstration of how to use them.",
