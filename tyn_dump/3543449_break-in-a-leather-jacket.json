Leather is harder to repair than other fabrics, so gouging or otherwise damaging your leather can leave it with a permanent mark. Opt for a gentler abrasive, like mild steel wool, high-grit sandpaper, or a nylon abrasive pad. Using something harsher, like rough sandpaper, can cause more wear than you intended.

If your leather jacket is stiff, cracked, or flat-looking, a little conditioner can help soften and protect it, making it more comfortable to wear as a side effect. Leather conditioner can be bought at specialty shops and online for fairly cheap (usually $15-$30 per liter.) Good brands include Pecard, Lexol, Leather Honey, and others. Be sure to use a conditioning product that's suitable for your jacket's type of leather. Leather generally comes from one of four sources, each with its own texture: cattle, lamb, goat, or horse. Conditioners are usually formulated specifically for certain types of leather and not for others. Lighter fashion lotions are usually best for softer lamb and goat skins, while heavier all-weather conditioners are often best for cow and horse skin."
