Burned shisha will add a nasty flavor to your smoke. Buy a good quality shisha. The quality of your shisha will determine the flavor of your smoke. You can also mix and match flavors for a great-tasting smoke. Buy 50-gram portions of shisha so that you can try it out without spending a lot of money.

You need to leave just enough room in the vase so that your smoke doesn't bubble up into the hose. Avoid putting milk or dairy into your base. Adding dairy will ensure an unpleasant smell, mold, foaming in the vase and ruined hoses. Add your grommet. The grommet is a seal that joins the stem to the vase. Most hookahs come with a rubber or plastic seal. Silicone is the best material for a seal, but you an also simply seal the vase to the stem with electrical tape. Put the tray that holds the coals onto the hookah. You need to put it on before you put the bowl on because the bowl may not fit over the tray. Insert the short end of the hose into the hose port. If your hookah has 2 ports, then you can purchase a rubber seal to close off the other port. Prepare your shisha. Follow all of these steps for the best smoking experience:\nEvenly mix your tobacco so that all of it is covered in flavoring and molasses. Fluff up your tobacco and drop it loosely into the bowl.

You can try a couple of different patterns based on the kind of bowl that you have:\n\nEgyptian bowl: Start with a circle of holes around the perimeter and spiral inward. Funnel-style bowl: Make 3 concentric rings: 1 around the edge, 1 around the spire and 1 between the 2 circles that you've already made. Light the coals.

Make a Fruit Bowl for a Hookah Find a circular fruit. Apples, mangoes or oranges make good choices, but you can use any large round fruit that you have on hand. Cut off the top of the fruit. Leave about 3/4 of the fruit intact. Dig out the flesh, leaving a 1/2\" (13 mm) of flesh attached to the sides. Poke a hole in the bottom. You can use a corkscrew, potato peeler or another sharp object. The hole should be the size of your index finger. (It is recommended to create a horizontal placing using toothpicks on the bottom of the fruit to prevent the tobacco from falling into the Hookah body). Sprinkle the shisha into the bowl. Leave about 2 millimeters of empty space at the top. Cover the fruit with foil. Poke small holes throughout the foil that are evenly spaced. Put the fruit bowl onto the stem. Light the coals and smoke the hookah. Because of the coolness of the fruit, you may have to use a few more coals than usual to get your smoke going. Craft a Hookah Out of Supplies in Your Home Cut the top 1/4 off of the apple. Dig out the flesh, leaving a 1/2\" (13 mm) thick layer on all sides. Poke a hole into the bottom of the apple. Use a potato peeler, a corkscrew or a paring knife. Cut a piece of garden hose to the desired length. Screw the apple onto the top of the hose, and seal the connection with some plasticine. Burn a hole into the side of a plastic bowl near the bottom. You can use a burning cigarette or other concentrated heat source to make the hole. Insert a straw into the hole. The connection should be tight. If you see a gap between the plastic and the straw, then seal the gap with more plasticine. Fill the fruit bowl with tobacco.
