If your flowers were presented in a bouquet or hand-tied arrangement, you may be able to utilise ribbon used on the arrangement - even if the type of ribbon isn't suitable, the color will likely be a good source of inspiration. This is best suited to vases with a neck. For square, rectangular, or pillar vases, consider gluing your ribbon down."
