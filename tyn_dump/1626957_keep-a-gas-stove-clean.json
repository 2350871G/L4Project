Cleaning a stove while it is hot can result in injury. Remove the burner grates and caps. Once the burners are cool, lift them away from the stove. Place them in the sink. Burners can be placed in a large bucket or wash basin if a sink is not available. Fill the sink with hot water and dish soap. Completely submerge the burners in hot water. Add a drizzle of dish soap to the water while it is running to create suds. Allow the burners to soak while you clean the stove. Cleaning the Stovetop Brush away loose debris. With a cleaning brush or paper towel, brush away any loose debris. Don\u2019t worry too much about scraping caked on food and grime. Scrub the stovetop. Clean the top of the stove using a stovetop cleaner or soapy water. With a clean rag or sponge, scrub the surface. Pay close attention to caked on food and grime. Don\u2019t forget to scrub the knobs and face. Spray some cleaner on tough spots and let it soak for five minutes before scrubbing. This will help to loosen the grime. Clean around the burners. Use a toothbrush to get into the crooks where the burners and caps sit. These areas can be tough to reach with a rag. Then wipe the area clean with a rag. Dry the stove. Use a clean cloth or paper towel to dry the stove\u2019s surface. Drying the stove\u2019s surface will prevent streaking and make your stove\u2019s surface shine. Cleaning the Burners Scrub the burner grates. Using a toothbrush or sponge, wash the burner grates that were soaking in the sink. Most of the grime will wipe away fairly easy since they have been soaking for several minutes. Set the clean burners off to the side. Scrub the burner caps. Using the same toothbrush or sponge, wash the burner caps. Set them off to the side with the burners. Rinse the burner parts. With fresh, warm water, thoroughly rinse the burner grates and caps. Be sure rinse away all of the soapy residue. If the burners still aren\u2019t clean after using dish soap, try a heavy-duty degreaser instead. Dry the burner parts.
