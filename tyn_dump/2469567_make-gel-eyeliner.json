The particles may fall in your eyes if you make a liner with the glitter. If you don\u2019t have a loose shadow pigment, you can scrape a pressed shadow with a nail file or butter knife to get some pigment to work with."

This gel liner isn\u2019t particularly long-wearing and can smudge easily. It\u2019s best used if you\u2019re doing a grunge makeup look or a smoky eye where you won\u2019t mind some smudging."
