That\u2019s where most the dirt and grease in your hair usually is. Applying shampoo to the length of your hair can also rough up the cuticle, so it looks frizzier once it dries. Choose a sulfate-free shampoo when you\u2019re washing. Sulfates, which are ingredients that help shampoo suds up, can be very drying, so they\u2019re a bad choice for frizzy hair. Look for a formula with glycerin instead. Avoid using too much shampoo when you wash too. A quarter-sized amount is usually enough. If you have very long or thick hair, though, you may need to double the amount."

Follow up with a deep conditioner, which contains intensively hydrating ingredients such as oils and butters, each time you shampoo. Allow the deep conditioner to sit on your hair for at least 5 minutes to ensure that it really penetrates and coats the strands. If you have very fine or thin hair, using a deep conditioner every time you wash may be too much for your locks. Instead, aim for once or twice a week to cut down on frizz."

To ensure that the serum is evenly distributed throughout your hair, work through your locks with a wide-tooth comb after applying it.

It\u2019s especially important to allow your hair to air dry at least part way before blow drying in the winter.

These dryers use a stronger motor and ionic technology to help dry your hair more quickly. As a result, you don\u2019t have to use the blow dryer on your hair as long so it isn\u2019t as easily dehydrated. Because ionic blow dryers work so quickly, it\u2019s easy to over dry your hair. Pay careful attention so you don\u2019t let your tresses get too hot. Using a round, natural bristle brush as you blow dry with your ionic dryer can give you very smooth, frizz-free hair."

For the best results, straighten your hair in small sections about half an inch (or about 1 cm) thick, so you don\u2019t have to run the iron over each piece more than once. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin flat ironing it. You can burn damp hair if you try to straighten it. Don\u2019t turn your flat iron up to more than 410 degrees. That amount of heat will smooth all types of hair. Choose a flat iron with ceramic plates. They heat more evenly, so they smooth and straighten more effectively."

Instead, use a curling iron to help smooth and define your natural texture. You don\u2019t necessarily have to curl your entire head -- just run the curling iron over sections that are frizzy. If you have tight, highly defined curls, choose a curling iron with a small barrel. A \u00be-inch model usually works well. If you have looser waves, opt for a curling iron with a large barrel. A 1-inch or larger barrel is usually the best bet."

Using a hydrating hair mask that contains ingredients such as oils, glycerin, and silk proteins once a week can deliver enough moisture to smooth your frizz. You should follow the instructions on your hair mask, but in most cases, you want to leave it on your head for at least 20 minutes. To make sure the mask is evenly distributed throughout your locks, comb it through with a wide-tooth comb. You can apply a mask to dry hair, but it usually absorbs more effectively when your hair is wet. Some heat can help the mask penetrate more easily, so you may want to put a shower cap over it or wrap your head in plastic wrap when you apply it. If you have one at your house, you can also sit under a hooded dryer while you have the mask on. It\u2019s a good idea to wash and deep condition your hair after you use a mask to make sure that there isn\u2019t any residue left behind."

It\u2019s lighter than a mask, so it won\u2019t weigh your hair down. Allow it to sit for approximately 30 minutes. You should only apply the hot oil treatment to the length of your hair from your ears down. It can make the top of your hair look greasy if you apply it there. You can purchase pre-made hot oil treatments that are easy to use. Follow the instructions on the packaging for the best results. You can also make your own hot oil treatment with hair-healthy oils such as avocado, castor, sweet almond, and argan oils. Set the container of the oil in a pot of water that\u2019s near boiling to warm it up, and then apply it to your hair in sections."

To keep your hair smooth, wrap your head in a silk scarf before going to bed. Silk is a soft, smooth material that won\u2019t damage your hair. Wet hair is especially prone to damage, so be sure to wear a silk scarf if you\u2019re going to sleep right after washing your hair. Instead of wearing a scarf, you can swap your cotton or other material pillowcases for silk."

        "Allow hair to air dry partway before blow drying.",
        "When you want your hair to look sleek and smooth, a blow dryer can come in handy.",
        "However, using one to completely dry your hair can lead to more frizz.",
        "Instead, let your hair air dry almost 90%, and use the blow dryer to finish it off.",
        "This rule applies if you are using a round brush with your blow dryer, too.",
        "It\u2019s especially important to allow your hair to air dry at least part way before blow drying in the winter.",
        "That\u2019s because there\u2019s less humidity in the air in cold weather, so your hair is already drier.",
        "Use an ionic blow dryer.",
        "Not all blow dryers are created equal.",
        "With frizzy hair, it\u2019s best to choose an ionic model with a higher wattage.",
        "These dryers use a stronger motor and ionic technology to help dry your hair more quickly.",
        "As a result, you don\u2019t have to use the blow dryer on your hair as long so it isn\u2019t as easily dehydrated.",
        "Because ionic blow dryers work so quickly, it\u2019s easy to over dry your hair.",
        "Pay careful attention so you don\u2019t let your tresses get too hot.",
        "Using a round, natural bristle brush as you blow dry with your ionic dryer can give you very smooth, frizz-free hair.",
        "Flat iron your hair to smooth it.",
        "One of the easiest ways to tame frizzy hair is with a flat or straightening iron.",
        "It seals the cuticle so your hair looks as smooth as possible.",
        "For the best results, straighten your hair in small sections about half an inch (or about 1 cm) thick, so you don\u2019t have to run the iron over each piece more than once.",
        "Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin flat ironing it.",
        "You can burn damp hair if you try to straighten it.",
        "Don\u2019t turn your flat iron up to more than 410 degrees.",
        "That amount of heat will smooth all types of hair.",
        "Choose a flat iron with ceramic plates.",
        "They heat more evenly, so they smooth and straighten more effectively.",
        "Define natural texture with a curling iron.",
        "If your frizzy hair is naturally curly or wavy, you don\u2019t have to straighten it to tame your frizz.",
        "Instead, use a curling iron to help smooth and define your natural texture.",
        "You don\u2019t necessarily have to curl your entire head -- just run the curling iron over sections that are frizzy.",
        "If you have tight, highly defined curls, choose a curling iron with a small barrel.",
        "A \u00be-inch model usually works well.",
        "If you have looser waves, opt for a curling iron with a large barrel.",
        "A 1-inch or larger barrel is usually the best bet.",
        "Using Specialty Treatments on Frizzy Hair Apply a hydrating hair mask.",
        "Deep conditioning when you wash can help moisturize your locks, but frizzy sometimes need more intensive hydration.",
        "Using a hydrating hair mask that contains ingredients such as oils, glycerin, and silk proteins once a week can deliver enough moisture to smooth your frizz.",
        "You should follow the instructions on your hair mask, but in most cases, you want to leave it on your head for at least 20 minutes.",
        "To make sure the mask is evenly distributed throughout your locks, comb it through with a wide-tooth comb.",
        "You can apply a mask to dry hair, but it usually absorbs more effectively when your hair is wet.",
        "Some heat can help the mask penetrate more easily, so you may want to put a shower cap over it or wrap your head in plastic wrap when you apply it.",
        "If you have one at your house, you can also sit under a hooded dryer while you have the mask on.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to wash and deep condition your hair after you use a mask to make sure that there isn\u2019t any residue left behind.",
        "Use a hot oil treatment.",
        "If you don\u2019t have thick hair, using a mask regularly may be too heavy for your tresses.",
        "Instead, make time for a hot oil treatment each week.",
        "It\u2019s lighter than a mask, so it won\u2019t weigh your hair down.",
        "Allow it to sit for approximately 30 minutes.",
        "You should only apply the hot oil treatment to the length of your hair from your ears down.",
        "It can make the top of your hair look greasy if you apply it there.",
        "You can purchase pre-made hot oil treatments that are easy to use.",
        "Follow the instructions on the packaging for the best results.",
        "You can also make your own hot oil treatment with hair-healthy oils such as avocado, castor, sweet almond, and argan oils.",
        "Set the container of the oil in a pot of water that\u2019s near boiling to warm it up, and then apply it to your hair in sections.",
        "Sleep in a silk scarf.",
        "Just as drying your hair with cotton towel can rough up the cuticle and leave it frizzy, sleeping on cotton pillowcases can mean waking up with major frizz.",
        "To keep your hair smooth, wrap your head in a silk scarf before going to bed.",
        "Silk is a soft, smooth material that won\u2019t damage your hair.",
        "Wet hair is especially prone to damage, so be sure to wear a silk scarf if you\u2019re going to sleep right after washing your hair.",
        "Instead of wearing a scarf, you can swap your cotton or other material pillowcases for silk."
