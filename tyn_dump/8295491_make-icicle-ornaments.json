Place it on the stove, and let it come to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. Stir in 9 tablespoons (234 grams) of Borax. Keep stirring until the Borax dissolves. This can take a few minutes. Pour the water into a large jar. If you are making several ornaments, you can pour the water into several smaller jars. Keep in mind that your icicles will be a little shorter than the jar, so don't go too small. Cut down your pipe cleaners. These will eventually become your icicles, so you can make them as long or as short as you want them to be. They need to be short enough so that the ends are at least \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the bottom of the jar when you stick them in. The color of the pipe cleaners may still show through. For best results, use white pipe cleaners. Light blue or silver may also look nice, however. Cut your string, and tie it into loops. Cut as many pieces of string as there are pipe cleaners. Next, tie the ends of each string together to make loops. These will allow you to hang your ornaments. You can use any type of string you want; a good option would be clear thread or fishing line, however. Attach the loops to each pipe cleaner. Slip the end of a pipe cleaner through a loop, then fold it over so that it hooks onto the loop. Do this for all of the pipe cleaners and loops. Thread a loop onto a pencil, then dip the pipe cleaner into a jar. Place the pencil over the mouth of the jar so that it doesn't fall in. If the pipe cleaner is still too long, take it out of the water and trim down the end; alternatively, you can untie the loop, then retie it shorter. The pipe cleaner needs to be at least \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the bottom of the jar. If you don't have a pencil, you can use other items, such as a spoon, skewer, chopstick, pen, paintbrush, or popsicle stick. You can put more than one pipe cleaner into a jar, but don't let them touch each other or the walls of the jar. The fewer pipe cleaners you put into a jar, the more crystals will form. Place the jars some place where they won't be disturbed, and leave them there overnight. Anywhere between 8 and 12 hours should be sufficient. Take the icicles off the pencil, and hang them on your tree. Be careful with these icicles, as they are very fragile! Making Plastic Bottle Icicles Clean the bottle and remove the label. For best results, use a clear bottle. A translucent blue bottle may also work. Don't worry if the bottle has any bumps or ribs. Make sure that there is no paper or glue residue left on the bottle, however. Cut the top and bottom off of the bottle. Don't worry about being too neat here; you will fix any jaggedness in the following step. Cut the bottle, lengthwise, into thin strips. Taper the strips slightly so that they are flat at one end, and pointy at the other, just like real icicles. They should be no wider than 1 to 1\u00bd centimeters (2.54 to 3.81 inch) at the widest point. Hold the plastic strip by each end, then hold it over a lighted candle. Hold the strip close enough so that it heats up, but not so close that it starts to melt or burn. Keep the tapered/pointed part of the strip closest to the flame. Use a short, stubby pillar candle instead of a long candlestick. It will be less likely to tip over. Move the strip across the flame, twisting it while doing so. Pull gently on the ends so that they don't warp or bend. You want the icicle and coil, but you don't want it to curve or bend. Pull the icicle straight once you get to the other end, and wait until it cools. You should now have a coiled strip of plastic. Don't get disappointed if your first one doesn't turn out perfect; some people need a few tries to get it right. Poke a hole through the top/flat part of the icicle with a heated needle or nail. Hold a needle or nail over a candle flame until it gets hot, then use it to poke a hole through the top part of your icicle. Wait for the plastic to cool before moving on. Pull some thread through the hole, then tie the ends into a loop. You can use any color you want, but white, silver, or clear thread would look the best. If you'd like to make a garland instead, make several icicles, then thread them onto a long piece of string instead. Making Hot Glue Icicles Spread some parchment paper over your work surface. If you don't have any parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead, but be sure to spread a thin layer of dish soap over it. Wax paper is a little different than parchment paper, and if you don't lubricate it with dish soap, the icicles will stick. Insert a hot glue stick into your hot glue gun, and let it heat up. You can use ordinary, clear hot glue sticks, or you can use the glittery kind. Silver, gold, or iridescent would all work well for icicles. Draw straight lines on your parchment paper. If you'd like, you can vary the pressure on your hot glue gun while squeezing it to create lumps. You can also go back, and make the top part of each icicle thicker. Consider shaking some glitter onto your icicles. Do it quickly, or the glue will set, and the glitter won't stick. White or iridescent glitter would work the best, but silver or gold would look nice too. If you used glittery hot glue sticks, then you can skip this step since they are already sparkly. Wait 2 to 3 minutes for the hot glue to cool. If you used plain hot glue, you may notice it turning slightly foggy, which is normal. If the glue is taking too long to set, stick the parchment paper into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes. Carefully peel the icicles away from the parchment paper. Hot glue sometimes leaves behind \"whiskers\" or threads, which can make your icicles look messy. If you got any of those, carefully peel them away. At this point, you can flip the icicles over, and draw some glue on the back to make them more dimensional. Tie some thread into a loop, then hot glue it to the top of each icicle. If you have a very sharp needle, you can thread the needle, then pull the needle through the top of each icicle instead. Clear thread will work best for this.",
