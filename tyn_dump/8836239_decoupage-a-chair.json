Use this photo or sketch to guide placement of the pieces when adding them. The decoupage can overlap or be separated to allow the viewer to detect each individual piece (the paint color will show through nicely if you leave gaps). Cut out more design pieces if needed. This isn't the time to be skimping on pieces. You don't need to confine your efforts to the seat; if the design looks good going up the chair back and down the chair legs, that's fine but just check the design looks good.
