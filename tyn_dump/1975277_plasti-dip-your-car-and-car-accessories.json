Scrub the vehicle from top to bottom with a specialty car wash soap, paying particular attention to areas that you intend to dip. Use a natural sponge or lamb\u2019s wool mitt to prevent scratches. Another option is to soak the corner of a cloth with rubbing alcohol diluted with 30-50% distilled water and use it to wipe down the specific areas that you want to dip. You don\u2019t need to worry about the alcohol harming your vehicle\u2019s finish, so long as it\u2019s slightly diluted. Plasti Dip will stick better to a nice, clean metallic surface than it will to one covered in a layer of dirt and grime.Warning: Applying the coating on top of stuck-on messes like bird poop or decaying leaves will trap them against the surface of your vehicle, resulting in an unattractive, lumpy appearance and potentially damaging the paint underneath."

Plasti Dip spray cans are perfectly suited for smaller dipping projects like rims, grilles, and emblems.

For optimal coverage, overlap each stroke by 50-60%. Try not to let your sprayer linger in any one spot for too long, as this can create drips or ripples that can disrupt the clean, uniform look of the coating.

This will keep you from inadvertently getting the Plasti Dip all over your driveway or the floor or your garage. Canvas tarps, plastic sheeting, newspapers, and old rags can all make good dropcloths. There\u2019s no need to lay out 4 separate dropcloths\u2014when you\u2019re finished dipping your first rim, just gather up your materials and move them over to the next wheel. It\u2019s much harder to remove Plasti Dip from rough, textured surfaces like concrete than it is to remove it from smoother ones. Apply a light initial coat using short bursts from various angles. As you spray, sweep the nozzle of your sprayer or spray can back and forth in different directions to hit each section of the rim from all sides. Work your way from the outer edge of the rim inward towards the lug nuts, aiming for consistent overall coverage. Use this same technique for each of your rims. Plasti Dip spray cans are perfectly suited for smaller dipping projects like rims, grilles, and emblems. It may take a little longer to get an even coat on your rims than on the body of your vehicle, since they feature more contoured surfaces, angles, and fine details. Stay focused and work patiently. Let your first coat dry for 15-30 minutes. For efficiency\u2019s sake, proceed in a cyclical fashion, dipping every next rim while the one you just completed is drying. In the time it takes you to lay a base coat on each of the remaining rims, the one you started with should be sufficiently dry and ready for the next application. Check to make sure that the coating is dry to the touch before you continue. If it feels tacky or is still visibly wet in places, you\u2019ll need to give it a little longer. Spray on a minimum of 3-4 follow-up coats. Apply your subsequent coats the same way you did your base coat, spraying quickly from many different angles. For these coats, however, make it a point to build up heavy, wet layers. Doing so will help eliminate unwanted texture and ensure a smoother finish. For optimal coverage, overlap each stroke by 50-60%. Try not to let your sprayer linger in any one spot for too long, as this can create drips or ripples that can disrupt the clean, uniform look of the coating. If you do happen to notice any dripping, blot the excess coating with a cloth, then go back over the area with a light spot-coat to hide the mistake. Let your final coat cure for at least 4 hours. It's best to put your vehicle up in a covered location while your topcoat is drying, if you have the option. That way, it will be safely insulated from outside substances and conditions that might threaten its ability to set properly. When 4 hours is up, you\u2019ll be ready to hit the streets in style! Avoid washing your vehicle or getting it wet for any reason until the Plasti Dip has cured fully. Dip any other accessories you want to modify using the same method. You don't have to stop with your body and wheels. If you want to dip your grille, emblems, badges, or other exterior accessories, feel free to hit them with 5-6 coats, as well. You can either spray them while you're waiting for your rims to dry or treat them during a separate session. Smaller accessories are easy to overspray, so be sure to use a light touch and quick, fluid strokes when upgrading these areas.",

        "Stick to one area at a time until you\u2019re finished with it, then move on to a neighboring area.",
        "No matter how you approach it, dipping an entire vehicle is a time-consuming project.",
        "In most cases, you can expect full-body applications to take around 3-5 hours.",
        "Allow 15-30 minutes of drying time between coats.",
        "This is about how long it will take for your first coat to dry to the touch.",

        "You can get away with 2-3 coats on hard-to-reach spots like the wheel wells and gaps between individual panels.",
        "Remember to wait 15-30 minutes between coats.Tip: The thicker the finish, the better it will protect and the easier it will be to peel off.",

        "These substances could affect the curing process or even ruin the fresh coating.",
        "If possible, move your vehicle into a garage for the night as soon as you\u2019re done spraying and hold off on using your work area for other projects until the coating has had ample time to cure.",
        "Provided you\u2019ve applied it properly, your vehicle\u2019s Plasti Dip coating should last for 3 years or more without having to be touched up.",

        "Spraying Your Rims and Other Accessories Remove your wheels or mask your brakes with plastic.",
        "If you have the time, the tools and the know-how, it\u2019s a good idea to take the wheels off of your vehicle completely to make it easier to dip them without ruining your brake components or wheel well.",
        "Otherwise, cut plastic trash bags in half lengthwise and slip them through the gaps in the wheel spokes to cover your brakes.",
        "Many automotive stores sell brake masking plastic designed specifically for this purpose.",
        "Removing your wheels will add extra time and labor to your project, but it\u2019s the only way to guarantee that you won\u2019t get the coating on any of the surrounding components.Tip: Additionally, some Plasti Dip aficionados suggest cutting out cardboard circles to fit behind your wheels or inserting playing cards between the outer edge of the rim and tire to prevent overspray.",
        "Clean your rims thoroughly with a quality tire cleaner.",
        "Start by wiping away as much dirt and brake dust as you can with a microfiber cloth.",
        "Then, take a separate, clean cloth, spray it with a generous amount of wheel cleaner, and polish your rims until they shine.",
        "Use the tip of your finger to work the cloth deeper into grooves, recesses, deep contours, and other less-accessible areas.",
        "You can also clean your wheels with a regular car wash soap if you don\u2019t feel like going out and buying a specialty wheel cleaner.",
        "Just be prepared to use a little extra elbow grease.",
        "A good wheel cleaner will remove more stuck-on dust and grime than soap and water alone.",
        "The cleaner your rims are, the better the Plasti Dip will stick.",
        "It may be okay to skip this step if you already got your rims nice and clean while washing your vehicle in preparation for coating the body.",
        "Place a makeshift dropcloth below your wheel to protect against overspray.",
        "Choose a material that extends at least 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) beyond the outer edges of your tires.",
        "This will keep you from inadvertently getting the Plasti Dip all over your driveway or the floor or your garage.",
