If the snake is unknown to you or is venomous, get help from a professional snake handler or reptile veterinarian and do not touch the snake! Even if the snake is a pet or a non-venomous garden snake, if you don't know how to handle snakes safely, find someone who does. Improper handling of a snake will usually result in the snake biting in self-defense."

Do not squeeze the snake tightly as you do so. Keep a firm but gentle grip to allow the snake to propel itself forward slightly in your hands. If you have a snake hook, you may also use that to pick up your snake. Slide the hook under the middle of your snake's body, lift it up, and then transfer the snake to your hand. Snake hooks are useful for picking up your snake when it is active and it may also help to prevent a bite, since snakes sometimes mistake hands for food.Tip: Avoid picking up your snake when it is hungry and after it eats. Your snake may mistake your hand for food when it is hungry and want to be left alone after eating its food."
