If you'd rather skip the initial germination phase, larger cuttings can be taken from the tips or cane (the long, woody stalk from which the leaves sprout). Both forms will flourish equally well so long as they are properly cared for. Look for Dracaena specimens at your local greenhouse or plant nursery. Soaking the seeds in fresh water for 3-5 days before planting them will aid in germination. It's also possible to transplant young plants whole from one pot or garden plot to another."

This will help keep the roots bound, allowing the plant to grow larger, healthier, and at a faster rate. Whatever pot you go with should have holes at the bottom to facilitate drainage.

If you're potting a whole plant, press the root ball into the depression you made at a slight angle and pile the soil up around the canes to anchor them. If you're working with seeds or smaller cuttings, simply cover them with a thin layer of soil. Dracaena Marginata can get pretty big, so limit one plant per pot. Gently separate the ends of the roots with your fingers to prevent them from clustering together. When starting from seeds, it typically takes 30-40 days for the plant to sprout. The basic planting procedure will be the same whether you choose to grow the plant inside or outside."
