Once the soap has melted in the water, add your grated beeswax or paraffin and stir again until it has melted with the rest of the mixture.

Making a Cream-Based Saddle Soap Cut a 2 lb (0.91 kg) block of glycerin in half. Glycerin is often sold in supermarkets, craft stores, and beauty stores in a 2 lb (0.91 kg) block. Once you have the 1 lb (0.45 kg) block of glycerin you need for this recipe, you can save the other half for another saddle soap mixture in the future. If you're storing extra glycerin for future use, you can wrap it in plastic wrap or wax paper, and store it in a cool, dry area. Cut the 1 lb (0.45 kg) block of glycerin into smaller chunks. The small chunks of glycerin you cut do not have to be perfect or even. Cut the block into small chunks the size of your thumbnail. These smaller pieces will melt more quickly in your microwave. Melt the 1 lb (0.45 kg) of glycerin in 30 second intervals. Place the small chunks of glycerin in a microwaveable bowl. Heat the glycerin on medium power for 30 seconds in your microwave, then remove and stir. Keep microwaving in 30 second intervals until the glycerin has melted.
