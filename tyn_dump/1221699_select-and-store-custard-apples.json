Avoid fruit that has black or purple coloring, as it is no longer fresh and may even be rotten. There is a new late-fruiting variety of custard apple that has a pink skin. It is known as Pinks Blush. If you're lucky enough to find this unusual variety (Australia only currently), it will have a pink skin rather than light green."
