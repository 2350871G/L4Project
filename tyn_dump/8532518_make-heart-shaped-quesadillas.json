Lay out your 8 tortillas onto a cutting board and press down on the surface of the tortilla with a heart shaped cookie cutter. You can purchase heart shaped cookie cutters online or at most major department and craft stores. Layer a couple of tortillas over each other to cut them faster. Lay your heart tortillas onto a greased cooking sheet. Grease a standard 9 x 13 in (22.9 x 33 cm) cooking sheet with a cooking spray or olive oil so that your tortillas don't stick to the pan as they cook. Sprinkle the grated cheddar on the tortillas. Put the cheese in the center of the tortilla in a little pile. Try to get an even distribution of cheese on all the tortillas so that they taste similar. Place another heart tortilla over the cheese. Line up 8 more of your tortilla hearts and place them over the existing tortillas with cheese on your cooking sheet. This will complete the preparation portion for your quesadillas. Heat your oven to 325\u00b0F (162.7\u00b0C) and cook for three minutes. Preheat your oven and bring it up to 325\u00b0F (162.7\u00b0C).

The cheese inside of the quesadilla should be completely melted. Allow quesadillas to cool and serve. Allow your quesadillas to cool for a minute. Do not let your quesadillas sit for too long before serving, because the cheese will harden as it's out of the oven. Sprinkle salt over the top of your quesadillas to finish seasoning them and serve them. Making Bacon and Cheese Quesadillas Cut your tortilla into a large heart shape. Use a sharp pointed knife to cut out a heart shape over a cutting board. The heart should take up the majority of the tortilla. The smaller that you cut the heart, the smaller your quesadilla will be. Brush one side of each tortilla. You should only brush one side of the tortilla so that the other side of your quesadilla is dry and cool enough to be eaten with your hands.
