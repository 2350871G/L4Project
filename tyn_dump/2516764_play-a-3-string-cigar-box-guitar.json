Start in the 5th fret on G, then play the notes up to high G.In Western music many chords are made up of a triad; the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a scale. Due to the limitations of this instrument (only 3 strings), a chord is made of the 1st and 5th notes in the scale. For example, an A chord is composed of A and E (and A'). This means a barre placed across the 3 strings will make a chord. Use a glass or steel slide to form the barre (or lay one finger across all three strings). Place the slide directly above the metal fret wire to make a crisp note. Keep the slide parallel with the frets when you move it. Pick a note, then slide a fret or two up or down the neck to the next note."
