Get an idea for how much gauze you'll need by pulling out and cutting off a strip long enough to wind several times around your dog\u2019s head. Before cutting the gauze, wrap it around your dog's head from under their chin to behind their ears. Then triple this length before cutting. The length that you cut depends on the size of your dog\u2019s head. You will obviously need a longer strip for a bigger dog. Cutting off such a long length allows you extra in case you estimated the size of your dog\u2019s head wrong."
