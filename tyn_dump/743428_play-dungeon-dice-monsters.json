Playing the Game Select and roll your dice. You should select the dice set that corresponds with the monster level that you hope to summon. Therefore, if you want to summon a level one monster, then you should select the level one dice set. Once you have selected your dice set, roll the dice to see if you can summon or just collect points. Collect crest points. If you roll crest symbols other than the summon crest, then you can add them to your crest counter. Make sure that you pay attention to the symbols and only give yourself the number of crests indicated by the dice roll. Summon a monster if possible.

Dungeon pieces may not overlap or go over the edge of the field. Attack your opponent or move a monster.
