Pre-soak supporters believe it helps the basket steam better and last longer. Check the product guide to see if the manufacturer recommends pre-soaking. Never soak the basket for more than 5 minutes.

        "Every stove is different, so it may take some trial-and-error to figure out the best heat settings in your case.",
        "Put the steamer in the pan and add either its own cover or the pan\u2019s lid.",
        "Bamboo steamers come with a woven lid that fits snugly on whichever tier you have on top, so use it in most cases.",
        "If you\u2019re only steaming a single basket tier, it may be possible\u2014if you wish\u2014to just use the pan\u2019s lid to cover the basket.",
        "Using the pan\u2019s lid may slow the evaporation of the water slightly, but the difference is usually negligible.",
        "Allow the food to steam until it\u2019s done to your liking.",
        "In general, meats take around 20-30 minutes to cook through, seafood and dumplings (a bamboo steamer specialty!)",
        "take around 10-15 minutes, and veggies take about 5-10 minutes.",
        "Keep the lid on until you approach the expected cooking time, and put it back on right away if the food isn\u2019t ready yet.",
        "Cook veggies until they are heated and tender to your liking.",
        "Use a kitchen thermometer to make sure meats are cooked to a safe temperature\u2014for example, cook pork to 63 \u00b0C (145 \u00b0F).",
        "Check the water level under the basket if you\u2019re cooking for 10+ minutes.",
        "If you\u2019re cooking some veggies quickly, don\u2019t worry about the water evaporating.",
        "After about 10 minutes of cooking, though, carefully lift the entire basket out of the pan and make sure there is at least 2.5 cm (0.98 in) of water in the bottom.",
        "If there is, put the basket back in place and check again every 5 minutes.",
        "If the pan is low on water, add more until it\u2019s back to its starting depth.",
        "Turn the heat on the stove up slightly\u2014for instance, halfway between medium-low and medium\u2014for 2-4 minutes to bring the water back up to a simmer.",
        "Use heat-resistant gloves to lift the steamer out of the pan.",
        "Remove the steamer from the heat and the food from the steamer.",
        "When the food is cooked through, turn off the stove and use your heat-resistant gloves to lift the entire steamer out of the pan.",
        "Separate the different tiers and use tongs or chopsticks to transfer the food to a serving dish.",
        "Alternatively, you can serve the food straight from the steamer basket tiers.",
        "Cleaning Your Bamboo Steamer Rinse the steamer under warm water for a quick cleaning.",
        "Especially if you used leaves or parchment paper as a liner, a quick rinse is often all that\u2019s needed to clean your bamboo steamer.",
        "If there are some stuck-on bits of food, soak the basket in hot water for up to 5 minutes, then rinse it clean.",
        "Resist the urge to pop the steamer basket into the dishwasher for hands-off cleaning.",
        "While some bamboo steamer baskets are marketed as dishwasher-safe, the high heat and detergent used in a dishwasher may reduce the performance and lifespan of your steamer.",
        "Wipe away stuck food bits with a nylon scrubber if necessary.",
        "If rinsing alone, or soaking and then rinsing, don\u2019t remove all the food bits from the steamer, it\u2019s time to use some elbow grease!",
        "Never use steel wool or a bristled scrub brush, though\u2014instead, use a scrubber made of nylon.",
        "That way, you won\u2019t damage the bamboo while removing the food residue.",
        "Use only warm water while scrubbing\u2014skip the dish soap.",
        "Bamboo is very porous and will soak up the scent (and possibly the chemicals) in the soap, meaning your next batch of dumplings may taste a bit soapy!",
        "Turn to a tea bag or a lemon to get rid of odors in the basket.",
        "If you steamed seafood and your basket still has a fishy scent after you clean it, cut a lemon in half and rub the cut side all over the steamer.",
        "Or, soak a black tea bag in warm water for 1-2 minutes, then gently rub it over the steamer.",
        "Wipe cooking oil on the steamer basket after it air dries.",
        "Once you\u2019re finished cleaning and (if needed) deodorizing the steamer, leave it on a drying rack until all surface moisture is gone.",
        "Then, dip a clean cloth or folded-up paper towel into a dish of cooking oil and wipe a thin layer over all surfaces of the bamboo steamer.",
        "Return the basket to the drying rack and allow it to dry completely before putting it away.",
        "Oiling the bamboo may help keep it from drying out and cracking.",
        "Not all bamboo steamer lovers think oiling is necessary, though, so this is an optional step.",
        "Any cooking oil will work, but an oil with a mild flavor\u2014such as canola oil\u2014is less likely to impart any unwanted flavors on your next dish."
