        "Once you\u2019ve got the top piece in place, run the palm of your hand over it gently to smooth it down.Do your best to center the fondant on the cake.",
        "This will prevent it from sliding, pulling, or leaving any part of the cake exposed.",
        "When applying fondant to especially lofty cakes, it\u2019s often easier to cover the top first, then wrap the sides using a separate piece.",
        "This method tends to produce a cleaner silhouette than you would get by trying to smooth on a single giant sheet.",
        "Use a sharp knife to trim the excess fondant.",
        "Cut a slit into one of the loose edges all the way to the side of the cake.",
        "Then, holding one of the flaps with your free hand, turn the blade so that it\u2019s resting flat against the cake.",
        "Glide the knife slowly around the cake\u2019s outer perimeter to shear off the unneeded material.For best results, stay as close to the sidewall of the cake as possible without damaging it.",
        "If you feel the fondant start to tug or tear, drag your knife outward through the edge of the section you\u2019re holding to cut it free before resetting the blade at the beginning of the neighboring section.",
        "Wrapping Your Cake with Fondant Panels Measure your cake\u2019s sides to figure out how much fondant you need.",
        "For square and rectangular cakes, this is as easy as adding together the widths of all four sides.",
        "To figure out the dimensions for a round cake, first measure the height, then multiply its diameter (this should be plainly printed on your cake pan) by pi, or 3.14.To panel a square cake that\u2019s 10 inches (25 cm) tall and 14 inches (36 cm) wide for example, you\u2019d need a 10 in (25 cm) x 56 in (140 cm) piece of fondant.",
        "A round, double-barreled cake 12 inches (30 cm) tall and 16 inches (41 cm) in diameter would require a 12 in (30 cm) x 50 in (130 cm) strip of icing.",
        "Roll out a sheet of fondant big enough to go around the outside of your cake.",
        "Rather than rolling outward from the center the way you did for the top piece, use linear strokes to work the fondant out into an oblong strip.",
        "You\u2019ll be using this strip to panel the outside of your cake, so it needs to be slightly taller and wide than your cake in order to fit over the whole thing in one piece.It goes without saying that you\u2019ll need to use a much bigger lump of fondant this time.Tip: If you find that you don\u2019t have enough fondant, or if it starts to thin out as you roll, pull off small lumps of fresh icing and add them to the sheet wherever it needs to be built up.",
        "Cut your fondant to size with the aid of a ruler or tape measure.",
        "Now that you know how big your side piece needs to be, lay your measuring device out beside your oversized strip, first vertically, then horizontally.",
        "That way, you can easily gauge the necessary height and width while you focus on maneuvering your knife or fondant cutter.To get the lines for the top and bottom nice and straight, run your knife directly along the edge of your ruler.",
        "You\u2019ll probably need to reposition your ruler at least once while cutting along the width of your side piece.",
        "Roll the fondant around a thin plastic or wooden dowel.",
        "Lay your dowel along one of the shorter edges of the strip you just cut, making sure it\u2019s properly centered.",
        "Carefully gather up the end of the strip and curve it around the shaft of the dowel, then begin pushing the dowel along slowly to bundle the entire strip up into a neat roll.Be sure to dust both your dowel and your fondant to keep the fondant from sticking.",
        "Press the loose edge of the fondant into the side of your cake.",
        "Take hold of the fondant and stand it up on one of its longer edges carefully.",
        "With one hand, press the center of the sheet against the side of the cake and gently rub it from top to bottom until it sticks.",
        "Use your other hand to steady the upper edge of the sheet and make sure it doesn\u2019t fall over.Placing your cake on a pedestal or similar raised dish can make it easier to align the bottom of the strip with the bottom of the cake.",
        "To avoid leaving behind unsightly depressions, smooth the fondant with the flat of your hand rather than your fingers.",
        "Unravel the fondant to transfer it to the cake with minimal effort.",
        "Twist the dowel slowly with one hand while moving your other hand along the rolled fondant to help guide it into place.",
        "When you return to your original starting point, smooth the icing all the way around with your palms to secure it.Use a delicate touch here.",
        "If you tear the fondant, you may have no choice but to re-roll it and start over.",
        "Trim any excess fondant from around the top of the cake.",
        "Push the tip of a sharp knife through the icing just above the cake\u2019s upper surface and run the blade smoothly around the exterior, pulling the fondant taut with your free hand at the same time.",
        "Afterwards, go over the seams on the top and side of the cake with your fondant smoother or the pad of one finger until they gradually disappear.To ensure that your cuts are as clean as possible, it may help to pause and rotate the cake every so often, or move around it yourself, if space allows.",
        "If the piece also turned out a little too wide, you may need to shave off the excess material where the two ends overlap, as well.",
        "Covering Tall Cakes for Storage Invest in an extra-tall cake keeper for simpler, more convenient storage.",
        "Cake keepers come in a variety of sizes, some of which range from 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) in height.",
        "One of these handy storage accessories should provide adequate clearance for all but the most colossal cakes.",
        "Just make sure the cake keeper you\u2019re using is roomy enough to comfortably contain your cake without rubbing up against the sides.",
        "Most culinary supply stores offer a good selection of cake keepers and serving domes.",
        "If you don\u2019t find the size you need, check online.Tip: If you plan on bringing your cake to a party or other event, look for a cake carrier with a locking lid and built-in handle for ease of transport.",
        "Place a large container over your cake to create a protective dome.",
        "An upended mixing bowl, bucket, washtub, or plastic storage container could potentially double as a makeshift cake shield in a pinch.",
        "A sturdy container will not only keep freshly-frosted cakes off-limits to dust, pet hair, and other drifting debris, but also safeguard them from being squashed if something happens to fall on them while they\u2019re sitting out.If you decide to go the thrifty route and repurpose another type of container, be sure to clean it thoroughly before putting it to its new use.",
        "It\u2019s also a good idea to label your container so that other people will know not to move it or otherwise mess with it.",
        "Wrap sliced cakes with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.",
        "Stretch out a sheet of foil or plastic until it\u2019s a little more than twice the height of the cake.",
        "Stick one end to the lower edge of the dish that your cake is resting on.",
        "Carefully drape the remaining material over the cake and secure the opposite end to the far side of the dish.",
        "Repeat this process with as many pieces as it takes to cover the cake completely.Stab a few toothpicks into the top of your cake prior to wrapping it.",
        "This will cause the foil or plastic to form a \u201ctent,\u201d minimizing sticking and smudging.",
        "A little plastic or foil will be your best bet if you\u2019ve already sliced your cake or need to store it temporarily but don\u2019t have a suitably-sized container on hand.",
        "Refrigerate your cake if you need it to keep for longer than 3-4 days.",
        "Seal up your cake with a few sheets of plastic wrap and make some room for it on your fridge's bottom shelf, where it can sit undisturbed until you're ready to serve it.",
        "When properly refrigerated, most kinds of cakes will retain their original flavor and texture for up to a week\u2014about twice as long as those stored at room temperature.Finding room for multi-tiered cakes may prove challenging.",
        "If you think you might need to refrigerate a cake that you haven't yet frosted, it may be easiest to wrap and put away the undecorated layers separately and assemble them just before your dinner or event.",
        "It will be especially important to keep your cake cool if either it or its surrounding layer of frosting contains perishable ingredients like eggs, milk, cream, or cream cheese."
