To sew bed skirts, you need 2 length-by-height panels and 1 width-by-height panel for the skirt as well as 1 width-by-length panel to cover the top of your box spring. Add 1 inch (25 mm) to the width and length measurements and 2 inches (5 cm) to the height measurement for the seam allowance. You now have the measurements that you will use for your panels."

For a ruffled bed skirt, you need to account for fullness; determine how full you want the skirt to be, either 2 to 3 times fuller than a smooth/flat bedskirt. A fullness of 2 is mildly full, while a fullness of 3 is extremely full. Multiply all the width and length measurements for the skirt panels by the amount of fullness you want. Use the resulting dimensions when cutting your fabric panels."

Additionally, press the 2 length edges and only 1 width edge of the main panel under, wrong side in, 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

If you are choosing to make a ruffled bed skirt, then you will need to gather your panels before you sew them to the main panel. To make gathered panels:\nSet your sewing machine to a zig-zag stitch, on the longest available stitch length. You will be stitching 1/2 inch (12 mm) in from the top edge (opposite of the hemmed edge) of the skirt paneling. Line up cotton crochet thread in the center of the presser foot so that, when you sew, the zig-zag stitch encloses the crochet thread. Make sure you do not sew the crochet thread into place, as you will need to pull it through the chamber made by the zig-zag stitching in order to create the gathering. Sew along the entire length of the panel. Pull the crochet thread from either end of the panel in order to gather the fabric until the panel is the appropriate width or length measurement. Adjust the gathers until they appear to be evenly spaced. Sew a straight stitch along the gathered edge to secure the gathers in place."
