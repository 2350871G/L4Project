                    "description": "If you can, try not to wash your hair every day. Daily baths and showers will strip your hair of its natural oils. That being said, if you apply products such as hair spray, mousse, gel, and anti-frizz products, these build up in your hair and inhibit the distribution of your hair\u2019s natural oils. It's advisable to wash hair products out of your hair as regularly as is required. If you never use hair products, you may get away with never using shampoo and just rinsing your hair occasionally. Massage your scalp with the shampoo, not with conditioner. Do this for about 40 seconds before washing it out. If you have oily hair, repeat the process once more (with the shampoo, not conditioner). When you massage the top of your head, the circulation increases and it also helps prevent dandruff. Use a sulfate and silicone free shampoo if your hair is curly or wavy. Sulfate-free shampoos help to prevent frizz. Pour conditioner into your hand and rub from the tips of your hair to the roots. If you want softer silkier looking hair, leave the conditioner in your hair for a few minutes before you rinse it off. Try to wash your hair on the coolest setting that is comfortable or at least try giving it a final rinse of cool water. This seals the hair cuticles (the outermost layer of the hair shaft) and locks in moisture, making it shinier. Hotter water may be used occasionally to wash hair if you have very oily or dirty hair. Either way, try rinsing in cool temperature water for the final rinse."

If you can, avoid drying your hair with heat as much as you can; it will only damage your hair. Avoid wringing your hair with a towel after you get out of a shower. Wet hair is more fragile, and wringing it could cause your hair strands to break or fall out. Use some heat protection spray when you blow-dry your hair.

Style your hair when it's wet and try not to touch or scrunch it while it air dries. Skip any styling products that contain alcohol. Sprays that contain sea salt are great for defining curls, but make sure it also contains conditioning ingredients, as sea salt can dry your hair. Try not to sleep with wet hair. If you have to, then braid or plait it in three or more sections. Also, sleep on a satin or silk pillowcase or head scarf to minimize frizz. Using Perms and Relaxers Perm or relax your hair no more than once every six weeks. Both perms and relaxers change your hair by changing the chemical bonds. For this reason, permed and relaxed hair is really vulnerable to breakage and damage. Minimize heat styling and blow-drying. Also, try not to dye your hair, if you're also chemically styling it. These processes can increase the risk of damaging permed or relaxed hair. Avoid relaxing your hair or getting a perm if your scalp is irritated. If you have scalp irritation, or any abrasions on your scalp, then you should not get a perm or use a relaxer. You should also hold off if you have just removed braids or extensions from your hair. Wait a few days or until your scalp is no longer irritated to relax or perm your hair. Use color with caution. Coloring permed or relaxed hair is possible, but it can damage your hair. Try clip-in weaves for highlights instead. If you need color, wait at least three days but no more than seven days for your appointment or talk to your stylist about what's healthiest for your hair. Coloring Your Hair Do your own dye job at home. You can do this easily if you're doing a quick coverage of gray hair and if the shade varies only slightly from your natural color. Anything more complicated should be handled at a salon. Rub petroleum jelly around your hairline to keep the dye from staining your skin. Set your timer per the directions on the dye package. Wash the color out immediately and all at once when the timer goes off. Get color at a salon. If you plan to visit a salon for a dye job, then do not use box dyes. They contain harsh chemicals that can damage your hair. Deep condition your hair a couple of days before your appointment. Moisturizing your hair will help it to hold color better. Also, if you can hold off, don't shampoo on the day of your appointment. Bring a picture. You can tell your stylist \"strawberry blonde,\" but he or she might have a very different vision of what that means than you do. A picture clarifies what you want. Take great care of colored hair. Keep your hair healthy and moisturized. Dry hair loses color quickly. Protect your hair when you head outside in the sun. Wear a hat or a scarf, or put your hair into a braid or a knot. You can also use products that contain SPF. Getting Great Hair as a Man Use any kind of shampoo. For most male hairstyles, no particular shampoo is better than another. If you have dandruff, look for some shampoo containing ketoconazole, salicylic acid, tar, zinc or selenium sulfide. Decide whether or not to condition. If you have straight, short hair, you can skip the conditioner or use a shampoo/conditioner combo. Curly, wavy or long hair, on the other hand, probably does need to be conditioned. Experiment with different brands to find something that you like. Protect your scalp from the sun. If you have thin spots, either rub sunscreen on them or use a spray sunscreen to keep your scalp from burning and peeling. Care for thinning hair. You can try an over-the-counter hair regrowth product or talk to your doctor about a prescription. Disguise thin spots by using extra-body conditioner and putting a dab of styling gel over the spot. Go easy on styling products. Don't use more than a dime-sized blob of gel. Once your hair is in place, you can finish it off with a bit of wax on the tips for definition and shine.",
