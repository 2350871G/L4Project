After you place the beeswax in the double boiler, you should see that it starts to soften and melt. Stir the beeswax around using a wooden spoon until it is completely melted.

Stir the mixture until it\u2019s fully melted. Use the wooden spoon to keep mixing the pomade mixture while it heats. Stop mixing when all the ingredients are fully melted and the mixture is homogenous. Pour the mixture in a container. Once you have finished making the pomade, pour it into a small, clean container with a lid, making sure to scrape down the sides of the double boiler to get all of the pomade. Let the pomade cool for at least three hours. Once you have poured the pomade into the container, leave the pomade to cool for at least three hours before you use it.

Combine jojoba oil and arrowroot powder in a bowl. In a separate bowl, add the jojoba oil, arrowroot powder and the vitamin E if you are using it.

Arrowroot is a thickening agent. It can be bought in health food stores or some major supermarkets. You can also substitute cornstarch for arrowroot powder if you have trouble finding it. Combine the shea butter and jojoba oil mixtures. Take the double boiler off the heat and pour the jojoba oil mixture into the top of the double boiler with the shea butter mixture. Add the essential oil and mix. Add in 10 drops of the essential oil of your choice, then mix the pomade ingredients together with a whisk or hand mixer for two or three minutes until the texture of the pomade is thick. You don\u2019t need to use essential oils, but they can add a nice scent to your pomade. Pour the pomade into a container.

To make a creamy hair pomade, add the shea butter, aloe vera, coconut oil, glycerin and the essential oil or oils of your choice to a large mixing bowl.
