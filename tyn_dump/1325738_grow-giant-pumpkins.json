If your soil doesn\u2019t have the proper amount of nutrients, fertilizers can help to create the perfect environment in which to grow your pumpkins. Even if your soil is nutrient rich, adding a granular fertilizer, composted manure, or mature garden compost will fertilize the soil while improving the structure of the soil. Incorporate this fertilizer into the soil several days before you intend to transplant your pumpkins. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9d\\/Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9d\\/Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Your plot should be located in the sun. Pumpkins need a fair amount of sunshine to grow up healthy and large. Keep in mind that pumpkins are sensitive and will need shelter from any intense wind. Add organic matter to your soil. Organic matters like manure will help your pumpkins grow up strong, healthy (and large!) You should use four inches of manure. Work the manure into the top few inches of soil. Selecting and Germinating Your Seeds Select proper seeds for planting. The genetics of the seeds you choose is important. They should come from a background of large-to-giant-size pumpkins.

Top quality pumpkin seeds with good genetics can actually cost up to $50 each. Plant your seeds. If you live in a place that could potentially get frost in late April or May, you should start by planting your seeds in pots and keeping them indoors. If you think your pumpkins will be safe from frost, plant your seeds outside. Keep in mind that the seeds that sprout the fastest will generally grow the strongest pumpkins. Germinating your seeds inside: Plant your seeds in peat pots that have four to six inches of soil in each pot. Plant the seeds one inch deep in the soil that is moist and keep the pots at around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius). Some people use a greenhouse effect while others find setting them on top of the refrigerator works well.

After a few weeks of growth, examine the pumpkin plant. Select the strongest looking vine in the group. Remove all others by clipping off the vines. Pollinating Your Pumpkins Pick your vine. The strongest and thickest vines often produce the largest pumpkins. Monitor your vines and see which one seems to be growing the fastest and thickest. Pollinate the pumpkin blossoms by hand. Pollinating by hand is the preferred method but if you don\u2019t have the time or the energy, it is a pretty safe bet that the bees will do most of the pollination for you. The flowers generally show up in late July. Identify the male and female plants to pollinate by hand. As in every form of reproduction, there is a male and female pumpkin counterpart. Do not begin pollinating until you the plant has roughly 200 leaves. The female has a small pumpkin at the base and no pollen inside the flower. To achieve the strongest female plant, you can break off the first female flower and wait for the second or third to grow (the strongest females grow when the vines are roughly 10 feet long, or longer. ){\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5a\\/Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5a\\/Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThe male will have a stamen inside the flower.

Only do this when a female flower grows from the largest and healthiest vine. Pulling the petal will help to expose the pollen needed for pollination. Rub the pollen stamen on the blossom of the female flower. This step is most successful if completed before the middle of July. This will ensure that the pumpkin has ample time for growth. Growing Your Gigantic Pumpkin Pick your prize pumpkin. The largest pumpkins balloon out from the vine. Vines generally have two to three pumpkins. Once your pumpkins have reached the size of a softball, select the one on a vine that looks the most promising. You will have to cut out the others as they will steal nutrients from the prize pumpkin. Tear out the roots that are close to the pumpkin. Pumpkin vines grow roots at every leaf. Tearing out the roots nearest to the pumpkin will allow the pumpkin a bit of wiggle room. If the vine is held down by the roots near the pumpkin, the pumpkin might accidentally tear itself away from the vine as it grows massive. This would effectively end any more growth. Train vines away from the pumpkin. While growing, the pumpkin could accidentally crush the vines near it. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Grow-Giant-Pumpkins-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMake sure to weed the area completely as your pumpkin vine grows. Once it reaches twenty feet and has covered the garden with leaves, you shouldn't have to weed anymore. Pinch off the ends and side shoots. Only do this when the primary vine has reached 20 feet (6.1 m) in length. Pinching off the ends and side shoots will guarantee that the vine\u2019s nutrients will go to your pumpkin. To increase the chance of a prize-winning pumpkin, shape the vine into a triangle. Treat the base of the vine as the bottom of the pyramid. You can cut the secondary side shoots shorter and shorter as they grow farther away from the base. For example, the shoots growing closest to the base might be twelve feet long; the next set of shoots might be ten feet long, then eight feet and so on. Give the pumpkin shade. You can either drape a sheet over it or build a small structure to hold a tarp up over the pumpkin. That said, try not shade too many of the leaves. These need sunlight to grow the pumpkin. Give each plant 15 to 20 gallons (56.8 to 75.7 L) of water twice a week. Only do this if it is a dry season. Pumpkins do most of their growing at night. Water in the early evening so that the leaves and soil are not wet overnight. Try to avoid getting water on the leaves because wet leaves are more susceptible to disease. Keep pests away. If you notice insects or other pests in your garden, research what they are, and take appropriate measures to control them. Growing flowers and herbs near your pumpkin patch can attract predator insects that naturally keep pests down. Common pumpkin pests include squash bugs, striped and spotted cucumber beetles, aphids, vine borers, wireworms, and six spotted leafhoppers. Harvest your pumpkins. Your pumpkins will be ready to harvest when they are a solid, deep color (and they are gigantic!) The rind should be hard. The vines will usually be dying back at this time.",
