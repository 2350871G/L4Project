Blue and black ballpoint pens tend to work well and you can usually find packs of these pens at dollar stores or general stores. Make sure they have an end you can pull out or unscrew to take them apart. Print a design on decorative paper. Visit an office supply store to choose some colored printer paper. You can use a computer program like PowerPoint or Photoshop to create a design to fit inside the pens. This can be anything, such as a repeating pattern of lines, shapes, or even a custom-designed graphic. You can make pens with your name on them, for instance. Instead of printing a design, print or write your name on the paper. Try using a custom stamp. You can also draw a design on the paper. Colorful markers or gel pens can make your design stand out more. Cut the design paper into strips that fit inside your pen. Use scissors to break your design down into thin strips you can fit inside your pen. An approximate size is about 3 in (7.6 cm) long and 1 in (2.5 cm) wide. This creates enough strips for a whole pack of pens. You can use a desktop paper cutter to cleanly cut the paper. Be careful when handling the sharp blade and keep your fingers away from it. Remove the pen\u2019s end cap to take out the ink tube. Pry of the end caps on the clear ballpoint pens with your fingernails.

First, place the ink tube roll inside the pen. The paper should fit in there without any problem. Next, close the pen\u2019s ends by replacing the end cap. You should be able to admire your awesome design through the plastic casing. If the paper doesn\u2019t fit inside the chamber, it may not be flat enough. Remove it, then try rolling it around the ink tube again. Cut the strip more if you need to. Making a Pom-Pom Pen Purchase pens without side clips. Smooth plastic pens work best, although you can use any pen if it doesn\u2019t have a plastic clip. If your pen has a plastic clip, you may be able to break the clip off to decorate the pen. Pull it back and it should snap off without much trouble. Wrap yarn around the bottom third of the pen. Choose a roll of yarn in a color you like. Wrap the loose end above the triangular cap containing the pen\u2019s nib. Depending on your pen, this may be plastic or metal. Then, wrap the yard around the pen repeatedly until it reaches about \u2153 of the way up the pen and knot it in place. Measure the amount of fabric tape needed to wrap around the pen. You can find rolls of fabric tape at most craft supply stores. Pick a pattern you like, then measure the amount of tape you need by comparing it to your pen\u2019s size. You need enough tape to cover the remaining \u2154 of the pen. You can use a ruler to measure the length and width of your pen.

Wait at least 30 minutes for it to dry. To fit the flower more securely, try a hot glue gun. Spread a thin layer of glue around the flower\u2019s stem, then press it into the opening. Fit Styrofoam into a round container. Find a round container, such as a pencil holder, a coffee can, or mason jar. You also need a piece of Styrofoam that fits snugly inside the container. Buy this at a craft supply store, then push it down into the container. If the Styrofoam doesn\u2019t fit, cut it to size using an X-Acto knife or box cutter. Instead of Styrofoam, you could fill the container with river rocks. Stick the pen in the container. Push the pen\u2019s tip into the Styrofoam.
