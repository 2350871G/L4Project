    "text": " Making the Dough Combine the flours in a mound with a hole in the center. Add \u2154 cup (83 g) of all-purpose flour and \u2154 cup (111 g) semolina flour to a medium bowl. Whisk the two together to mix them, and then use your hands to shape them into a mound with a well in the center. The mound that you form with the hole in the center should resemble a volcano. You don\u2019t necessarily need to use a bowl to mix the dough. Traditional Italian cooks often mix the flour together on a flat work surface, such as a wooden cutting board. Crack the eggs into the flour and season with salt. With the flour shaped into a mound, break 2 large eggs into the well in the center. Next, sprinkle a pinch of salt to taste over the eggs. Stir the flour into the eggs slowly. After you\u2019ve broken the eggs into the mound of flour, gently mix the flour into them. Use a fork to add small amounts of the flour from the walls of the mound to the egg center, working a little more flour in each time. Incorporate the rest of the flour with your hands and knead for several minutes.

You can cover the dough with plastic wrap if you prefer. Cutting the Farfalle Divide the dough into four pieces. Once the pasta dough has rested for a half hour, remove the towel. With a sharp knife, cut the ball into four equal pieces. Roll one part of the dough into a rectangle. Remove one piece of the dough from the bowl, leaving the remaining pieces covered so they don\u2019t dry out. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough piece into a rectangle shape that\u2019s approximately 1 mm thick.

If you\u2019d like your farfalle to have a more decorative look, you can use a pastry crimper to cut the rectangles so they have scalloped edges. Pinch each rectangle in the center to form a bow. After you\u2019ve finished cutting dough, use clean fingers to carefully pinch the center of each rectangle along the long side. Press fairly hard to form the trademark bow shape for the farfalle. Cover the farfalle and repeat the process with the rest of the dough. Place all of the shaped farfalle on a cookie sheet lined with wax or parchment paper, and cover them with a clean kitchen towel. Remove another piece of dough from the bowl, and repeat the process until you\u2019ve shaped all of it into farfalle. Boiling the Pasta Salt a large pot of water. To cook the farfalle, fill a large pot approximately three-quarters full with water. Sprinkle a pinch or two of salt into the pot to season the water. Bring the water to a boil. Place the pot on the stove, and heat it over high heat. Allow the pot to come to a boil, which should take approximately 7 to 10 minutes. Add the farfalle and cook it until it\u2019s al dente. When the water is boiling, add the fresh farfalle to the pot.
