                    "description": "Use an extension ladder for the easiest way to get up to your roof. Lay the ladder on the ground so one end is against your home. Once the ladder is vertical, grab a rung at thigh-height and pull the rope in the middle of the ladder to extend it. When the ladder is 3 ft (0.91 m) taller than your roof, release the rope so the rungs lock in place. Extension ladders can be purchased from your local hardware store. Have a partner help you support the ladder while you\u2019re extending it so it doesn\u2019t fall over. You can also use a step ladder as long as it\u2019s still 3 ft (0.91 m) taller than your roof."

Make sure the ladder\u2019s feet are on even ground so it doesn\u2019t rock back and forth while you climb it. If the feet aren\u2019t even, dig some of the ground out from underneath the higher side. For example, if your ladder is 16 ft (4.9 m) tall, place the bottom 4 ft (1.2 m) away from your home. Never keep your ladder on icy, muddy, or snow-covered ground since it could slip. Don\u2019t use wooden blocks or supports underneath uneven legs since they could fall out and cause you to lose your balance."
