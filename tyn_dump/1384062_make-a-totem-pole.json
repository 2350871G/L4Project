You could tell the story of one person's adventures, or depict your family history by adding a symbol for each member. You could tell the story of a town, a battle, or a relationship. Get creative! Think of the most important elements of the story. Make a list of each event, personality trait, family member, or other factor you want to include on your totem pole. The more elements you include, the longer your totem pole will be. Aim to have at least 5 story elements on your totem pole."

Traditional totem poles usually have carvings of animals as a way to tell their tales. You could take this classic route or choose symbols that have personal meaning to you. If you want to include animals as part of your totem pole, you can choose animals that are important to you, like your  spirit animal, or pick animals that have classically been used by totem pole artists that seem to fit with your story. Here are a few animals that are commonly seen on traditional totem poles:The thunderbird. This mythical creature has the power to make thunder, lightning and large gusts of wind. You could use it to symbolize a time in your story when chaos reigned. The bear. This beloved creature comes to others' aid in times of need. Use the bear to symbolize a person who is a good caretaker, or a time when help arrived. The owl. The wise owl is a symbol of souls that have passed on. The owl could be the past itself, or a person in your life who has passed away. The raven. This cunning, tricky bird is used to symbolize intelligence. The wolf. Wolves are symbols of power and loyalty. The frog. Frogs are said to bring great fortune, so use this symbol to represent a time of wealth and abundance. You could also make up your own non-animal symbols. People's faces, buildings in a city, a sword or spear, and other symbols can be used to help tell your story."
