    "text": " Cooking Skillet Cube Steak Remove the meat from the packaging. Cut the steaks four to six pieces, depending the serving size portions you prefer. Rinse each steak with cool water. Pat them dry with paper towels. Set them on a plate and sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the steaks. In a shallow bowl, mix the flour, spices, and salt. Use a whisk to thoroughly combine the mixture. Place the beaten eggs in a separate shallow bowl. Set a large skillet on a burner and turn it to medium high. Pour in about an inch of cooking oil, enough to come halfway up the sides of the skillet. Allow the oil to heat to 370 degrees Fahrenheit (188 degrees Celsius). Test the heat of the oil using a candy thermometer. If you don't have one, insert a wooden spoon handle into the oil. When it starts to boil rapidly, the oil is ready to fry. Dredge a steak in the egg on both sides. Shake it lightly to remove excess egg. Dredge the steak in the flour mixture to coat well on both sides. Set the steak in the skillet. Repeat until all of the steaks have been dredged in egg, then flour, and are cooking in the skillet.  Flip the steaks when the batter turns brown around the edges. The steaks should cook for about three minutes on both sides. They are ready when the batter is golden brown and no red juice is released when the steaks are poked with a fork. Drain the steaks on a plate lined with paper towels. This dish is classically served with  white gravy and potatoes.
