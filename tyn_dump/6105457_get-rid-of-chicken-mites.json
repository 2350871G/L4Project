    "text": " Wood Ash Treatment Obtain a tub or large bowl the size of your chicken. It does not have to be deep or any larger than your chicken but it does have to be able to hold the chicken inside it. To make sure of this, measure your chicken and the tub or lay your chicken inside the tub to see for yourself. Fill the tub with wood ash. Ash from your wood burning stove, fireplace or from a friend's stove will work well; just be sure that it is a couple of days old so it's completely cooled. Catch the chicken that you wish to treat and put them in the tub full of ash. Pour the ash over their body and rub it in their feathers and skin, using one hand to hold the chicken and the other to pour the ash. Try to cover every part of their body whilst avoiding their eyes and nostrils. Remove your chicken from the tub after they are fully covered with wood ash. Make sure to not shake or clean the ash off the bird but to just leave it alone. After that, cover the rest of your chickens with ash. Provide sand or wood ash for your chickens at all times. This lets your chickens dust-bath which kills any mites on them. If it is a rainy day and the sand gets muddy, provide a tub filled with sand inside their shelter/coop. Garlic Spray Acquire an empty/old spray bottle. Wash and rinse the bottle thoroughly making sure that any liquid that used to be inside the bottle is fully gone. Combine your spray ingredients. You'll need 10 ounces of water, 1 ounce of garlic juice and 1 teaspoon of essential oil such as lavender, cinnamon, spearmint, bay or thyme in the spray bottle. Spray your chickens with the mix every couple of days for 2-3 weeks.  Cooking Oil Spray Acquire another spray bottle. Wash and rinse the bottle thoroughly, getting rid of all liquid still inside of the bottle. Mix 2 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of dish washing liquid, 1 cup of cooking oil and shake well each time before you use it.  Use the spray for a whole week on your chicken coop. This will suffocate and kill any mites living in your chickens home. Neem Seed Oil Purchase a small bottle of Neem Seed Oil. This is available at most gardening centres. Acquire a sprayer bottle and clean it thoroughly. Mix 1 tablespoon of Neem Seed Oil per 2 litres of water in your spray bottle.  Spray the mixture inside your chicken coop and on your chickens to get rid of mites.  Diatomaceous Earth Treatment Spread some diatomaceous earth into your chicken coop. Diatomaceous earth will most likely kill all the parasites living in your chickens house. Leave the diatomaceous earth for a day or two. Diatomaceous earth is harmless to humans and animals so your chickens can walk amongst the earth whenever they please. After leaving the earth to kill the mites you can now clean it up with either a broom or vacuum. Rub diatomaceous earth into your chickens. Following steps similar to the wood ash method, above. Bathing with Oils Fill either a bath, tub or large bowl with warm or lukewarm water. Make sure the water just about reaches your chickens body. Put the chicken inside the tub and rinse their body with the water. Avoid getting water in your chickens eyes and nostrils. Purchase a soap containing either lemongrass oil, citronella oil, tea tree oil or peppermint oil. Wash your chicken with this soap which will most likely suffocate the mites. Rub your chickens legs with a vegetable oil such as corn oil, soybean oil or linseed oil. This will get rid of scaly mites. Get your chicken out of the tub/bath and dry them with a towel. Make sure they are in a nice and warm place, making them comfortable. Cleaning the Coop Be sure to clean your coop. Mites live in cracks, bedding and food bowls of the pen, so a clean start is important. Throw away all bedding. Hose down the coop. Dispose of all chicken feed and clean your chickens water and food bowls. ",
