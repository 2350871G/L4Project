You need to demagnetize this strip to help make the card unusable by anybody. You can do this by running a magnet all the way along the strip. Do this slowly so that the magnet is against the strip for a good amount of time. You can use any magnet. A fridge magnet will do the job. You can then cut along the strip with a pair of scissors."
