        "Push the circular saw in a straight line across the entire peak of your roof to make a slot for your ridge vent.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished sawing, remove the debris from your roof.",
        "Ridge vents can go across the entire length of your roof or placed in sections the same length as the vent.",
        "Cut the slots according to how you want the vent.",
        "Set the ridge vents on top of the slot.",
        "Use enough vent pieces to fill the length of the slot you cut.",
        "Center the vents on the peak of your roof so the sides of the vent lay flat on the roof.",
        "If you need to cut the vent to fit at the end of your roof, use a utility knife to make it flush with your home.",
        "Hold the vent piece in place until you can nail it down.",
        "Check your local hardware or home improvement store to see if they have ridge vents available.",
        "Use ridge vents meant for the pitch of your roof.",
        "Nail the vents to secure them in place.",
        "Use the pre-drilled holes in the vents for your nails.",
        "Make sure the nails are long enough to go through the vent and into your roof.",
        "Drive them in with a hammer so the vents are tight against the roof.",
        "Replace the cap shingles on top of the ridge vent.",
        "Layer the cap shingles on top of the vent and nail them through your vent to keep them in place.",
        "Make sure the nails reach down into the roof so they don\u2019t blow away in harsh weather.",
        "This step is optional only if you want to blend the vent into the rest of your roof."
