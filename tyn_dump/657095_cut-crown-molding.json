This is because it is fairly easy to line up the pattern in each corner as you go, but the final corner will most likely not match. In the first corner, draw a line on each wall that intersects at the corner along the bottom of the molding. This will help keep you aligned as you install. To do this, hold a small piece of scrap molding up to the corner. Run a pencil along the bottom of the molding to the corner, and repeat the process on the other wall so the lines connect."

Measure your wall and molding. Using a tape measure, measure the wall from corner to corner. Face the corner, and determine if you will start with the left piece or the right piece. Measure out your first piece of molding based on the wall measurement. Mark your measurements on the bottom side of the molding on both ends. Prepare to cut. Place the molding upside down on your saw table. Hold it as if the table was the ceiling, with the side that touches the wall facing you. This will allow you to see the measurement marks you made on the bottom edge. For the first section, you will be making straight 90\u00b0 cuts on both ends of the molding. The molding will be installed flush against the wall in the corner. Don't worry about the angle yet, the second piece will be cut to fit into the first. The Second Piece Measure out the second piece of molding. Mark the bottom of the molding. If you mark the top, your cuts will be incorrect. This is because the bottom of the molding goes all the way into the corner, while the top does not. Set your power miter saw to a 45\u00b0 angle. Assuming you are starting with the left piece, the saw should be angled from left to right. Be sure to place the ceiling part of the molding onto the deck of the saw table, while you hold the wall side facing you. Make the first cut, with the saw coming down on the mark you made on the molding. When in doubt, cut long so that you can shave the extra off. Cutting short can make the entire piece useless. Cut the other end. Adjust the saw angle back to a 90\u00b0. Bring the saw down on you measurement mark, leaving yourself a small amount of extra just in case. On the 45\u00b0 end, use a coping saw to cut away the back. Follow the contours of the molding and strip away the back wood . The idea is that the 45\u00b0 cut will fit over the contours of the first piece of molding. Sand it down to remove any gaps. Test the coping by holding a scrap piece of molding up against the contours. Gaps should be minimal. Use a caulk gun to fill in any gaps that won't go away. Finishing the Job Repeat the steps above for the remaining pieces of molding. If you are putting molding in a 4-wall room and started with a piece with two 90\u00b0 angles, you will have to make one piece that has two 45\u00b0 angles.
