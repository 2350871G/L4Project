They should be about 9 to 12 millimetres (0.35 to 0.47 in) thick, 140 to 160 centimetres (55 to 63 in) wide, and 100 to 120 centimetres (39 to 47 in) long. Get a longer or shorter board based on your size and height. Look for a board with a square or twin tail so it glides nicely on the sand. Sandboards can be pricy, ranging from $150-$200 USD. Get a sandboard with bindings if you plan to board standing up. Bindings are straps that are attached to the board and are designed to hold your feet in place when you are on the board. If you prefer to glide down the dunes on your stomach, you do not need a board with bindings. Most surf shops, and some snowboard shops, will offer sandboards. Talk to a sale representative in the store to find the right board for you."

        "You should slow down as you reach the bottom of the dune and come to a gradual stop.",
        "Run back up the dune with your board to do a second run.",
        "There are usually no lifts to carry you back up to the dunes so you will have to run back up the dune on your own.",
        "Do another run on the same hill to get the hang of sandboarding.",
        "Then, challenge yourself to do a bigger dune or a dune with a bigger slope.",
        "You may need to wax your board again between runs to keep it smooth and help it to slide on the sand.",
        "Practicing Stopping and Turning Practice slide stops.",
        "You will need to be standing upright on the board to try stopping and turning techniques.",
        "Start by finding a small dune with a slight slope.",
        "Place the board facing downhill.",
        "Put your weight in your heels and keep your toes up.",
        "Then, drop your toes down so the board lies flat and you slide slowly down the hill.",
        "Lift your toes and dig your heels in to stop.",
        "You can also try this facing uphill.",
        "Repeat the same steps, lowering your heels down to slide backwards and then raising them up to slow down to a stop.",
        "Try doing a full stop at the bottom of a dune.",
        "Once you have mastered slide stops, you can try doing a full stop once you ride down a dune.",
        "Pick a dune that ends in a flat, straight line.",
        "As you come to the flat sand at the bottom of the dune, shift your weight to your front foot and slide your back leg outward.",
        "Move your shoulders and hips frontward so you are facing towards the bottom of the dune.",
        "Raise your toes and slide your back foot out until you come to a stop on the edge of your board.",
        "Keep your weight even on both feet so you slide smoothly to a stop.",
        "Practice turning on a small dune.",
        "Begin by riding straight down a dune.",
        "Then, shift your weight forward and lift your back heel.",
        "Rotate your hips of where you would like to turn and let your body lean into the turn.",
        "Keep your hips and legs centered on the board as you lean.",
        "Make sure you give yourself time to turn, as it may not be a slow turn if you are in deep sand or sand that is slightly wet.",
        "Practice turning in different directions by lifting your back heel and rotating your hips while you are on the board.",
        "It may take some practice to be able to turn at faster speeds or as you come down steeper dunes."
