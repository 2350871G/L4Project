You will need to take steps to prevent Firefox 51 from automatically updating to the current version. If you already use Firefox, you can have multiple versions of Firefox on your computer, but you will also need to make sure you don't accidentally overwrite one version with another when doing installations. You can rename Firefox versions or install them in separate folders to prevent accidental overwriting. If you're using multiple Firefox versions, you can also use Firefox's Profile Manager to create a separate profile for use only by Firefox 51. If you use a separate profile for Firefox 51, you can prevent automatic updating of Firefox 51 while maintaining auto-updating of your current version of Firefox. Mozilla doesn't recommend downgrading to Firefox 51 because it will become increasingly less secure, so you should restrict using Firefox 51 to \"safe\" sites that need an NPAPI plugin such as Silverlight. More information about using Firefox 51 or ESR at websites requiring plugins such as Silverlight or Java may be found at How to Use Firefox ESR or Firefox 51 to Access Websites Requiring Silverlight or Java."
