You can use s'mores flavored pop tarts for this, but peanut butter and brown sugar are also great choices! Making Pop Tart Ice Cream Sandwiches Place two pop tarts on a cutting board, frosted-side-down. Save the other two pop tarts for later. You can use any type of pop tart for this, but flavors that do well in this recipe include: Cookies & Creme, Frosted Chocolate Chip, and Hot Fudge Sundae. Spread \u00bd cup (72 grams) of ice cream on top of each pop tart. You can use any type of ice cream flavor for this, but cookies-n-cream, cookie dough, or vanilla would work the best. Use an ice cream scoop to scoop out the ice cream, and a rubber spatula or knife to help you smooth it down across the pop tart. Make sure that the ice cream goes from edge to edge. Place the other two pop tarts frosted-side-up on top and press down lightly. Make sure that the edges are aligned. Press down lightly on top of the sandwich so that the ice cream reaches the edges. Use a knife or spatula to smooth down any ice cream that sticks out of the edges. Cut the sandwiches in half widthwise. If you need to, use a sawing motion to cut through the pop tart crust. This will give you four smaller ice cream sandwiches. Dip the sides of the sandwiches in chocolate chips or sprinkles, if desired. Fill a bowl with mini chocolate chips of sprinkles. Take an ice cream sandwich, and dip each of its four edges into the bowl. The chips/sprinkles will stick to the ice cream and give your sandwich and extra crunch. Wrap the sandwiches and freeze them for at least 2 hours. Carefully wrap each of the sandwiches in plastic wrap and stick them into the freezer. This will harden the ice cream back up and hold the sandwiches together. Making a Cookies-n-Cream Milkshake Pour the milk into a blender, and add the ice cream and the vanilla extract. Because of how rich this dessert is, you might want to use a low-fat or non-fat milk for this. If you don't mind rich milkshakes, then use 2% milk or whole milk. Cover the blender and blend until smooth. From time to time, you pay have to pause the blender, and use a spatula to scrape down any clumps. This will ensure that everything mixes evenly. Crumble the pop tarts into small pieces. Set these pieces aside. You can also try this with Strawberry pop tarts and make a strawberry shortcake milkshake instead. Add the crumbled pop tarts, and blend for a few more seconds. You want the crumbled pop tarts to be just combined; you should still see some little chunks and crumbs. Pour the milkshake into two tall glasses and garnish with a pop tart triangle. Use a spatula to help guide the mixture into two tall glasses. Serve the milkshake immediately.",
