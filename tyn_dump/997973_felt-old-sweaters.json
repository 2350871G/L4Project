Wool is the most used fiber for felting but you could also use a sweater made from cashmere, alpaca, camel hair or angora with wool (the angora cannot be used by itself, or it just doesn't turn into felt). Synthetic and plant-based sweaters do not felt; however, it is possible that a sweater with a very high level of animal fiber and a little synthetic may felt, provided the animal fiber forms at least 70 to 80 percent of the sweater. As well as what the sweater is made of, the general rule is that the heavier the sweater, the heavier the felt resulting from it. Hence, for a heavy-weight project, a sweater made from heavy wool yarn would work well, while for a lighter-weight project, use lighter wool yarn, or alpaca or cashmere."
