                    "description": "A T-bone steak is actually 2 steaks combined. T-bone steaks are measured from the edge of the tenderloin, which is the smaller steak, to the bone. The other steak is a NY strip steak, which is larger and not as lean. Tenderloins cook faster than strip steaks, so get larger tenderloins to cook your steak evenly. Although 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) is the most common size for grilled T-bone steaks, choose a 1 in (2.5 cm)-thick steak if you desire less meat. Anything smaller than this is prone to overcooking on the grill. Larger steaks, such as those over 2 in (5.1 cm) in thickness, are also good on the grill but take longer to cook."

The fat also gives the steak plenty of flavor. In the U.S., for instance, steaks are rated for quality. Prime steaks are the best cuts with the most marbling. Choice steaks are what most people grill. Select steaks are the lowest quality, so avoid them for grilling purposes. Also, pay attention to the fat around the outer edges of the steak. An \u20444 in (0.64 cm) layer of fat is ideal. If you see large chunks of white fat on the outer edge of the meat, you're going to pay for a part you can't eat."

Another option is to wait and add the pepper after cooking the steak. The pepper tends to burn a little, leaving a bitter flavor. Some people don't like this, but others think it balances out the flavor. Use other herbs and spices in a rub to give the T-bone additional flavor. For instance, mix together 2 teaspoons (4.2 g) of paprika, \u00be teaspoon (1.35 g) of cayenne pepper, \u00be teaspoon (1.80 g) of onion powder, \u00be teaspoon (0.24 g) of garlic powder, \u00be teaspoon (2.25 g) of turmeric, and \u00be teaspoon (1.35 g) of coriander.

        "At a minimum, cook the strip portion to 115 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) and the tenderloin to 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C).",
        "If you like your steak medium-rare, grill the strip portion to 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C).",
        "For a medium steak, continue cooking to 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C).",
        "Aim for 155 \u00b0F (68 \u00b0C) to make the steak well-done.",
        "Remember that the cooking time depends on many different factors, including the size of the steak and your grill's settings.",
        "Your time may vary.",
        "Turn up the heat setting on your grill to high.",
        "Leave the steak on the grill.",
        "Add more coals to the heated side of the grill or adjust the gas burners to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C).",
        "Make sure the heated portion is blazing hot before you finish the steak over it.",
        "The steak is already cooked, so all you need to do to finish it is sear it quickly over direct heat.",
        "When the grill is very hot, you will be able to hold your hand over it for 1 second or less.",
        "Sear the steak over direct heat for about 2 minutes per side.",
        "Cook the steak until it has a beautiful brown crust on the outside.",
        "Watch the steak the entire time to ensure it doesn't overcook.",
        "Flip it over using tongs or a strong spatula to finish searing the other side.",
        "To get perfectly square grill marks, rotate the steak 90 degrees after about 90 seconds of cooking on each side.",
        "This isn't important, but some people prefer the visual appeal of great grill marks.",
        "Tent the steak in foil and let it rest for 10 minutes.",
        "Move the steak off of the grill, then loosely drape a piece of foil over it.",
        "The steak will finish cooking up to its finished temperature as it rests.",
        "Leaving the meat alone for a few minutes also causes it to absorb all of the juices, leading to a tastier steak.",
        "At a minimum, wait 5 minutes before slicing the steak to avoid a slightly dry mess.",
        "Store leftover steak in an airtight container or wrap.",
        "It lasts about 4 days in the refrigerator and 3 months in the freezer."
