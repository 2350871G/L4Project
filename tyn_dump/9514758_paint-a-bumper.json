In order to keep from painting other parts of the car, you can either remove and paint the bumper separately or leave the bumper attached and carefully mask off the car body. Removing the bumper works best when you're repairing any scratches or cracks before repainting. Wash the bumper cover thoroughly with degreaser and water. Scrub the surface well with a tack cloth along with soapy water. Using a degreaser like kitchen soap will help remove dirt and oil, leaving your bumper cover clean and ready for paint. Wet sand the bumper cover with 600 grit sandpaper in alternating directions. Run your hand over the bumper to find any rough spots.

Remove any dirt and dust from sanding with the soft cloth. The surface should be clean and dry in order for the paint to adhere properly.

After the minimum 6 hours, you can remove any tape and masking materials from the car or reattach the bumper to the body. Repairing Shallow Cracks and Scratches Take the plastic bumper cover off of the car. Different car manufacturers use different ways to attach the plastic cover, such as screws, tabs, bolts, and other fasteners. Examine your bumper to find the connection points, then remove any fasteners and slide the bumper free. These connection points may be near the trunk latch, tail lights, or wheel wells, as well as hidden beneath bumper fascia. Scuff the damaged area and clean it with a plastic surface cleaner. Use some coarse sandpaper to lightly scuff up the plastic. Scuffing helps remove dirt buildup and creates a rougher texture to help the adhesive bond with the surface. After scuffing, wipe the area down with a plastic surface cleaner on a soft, clean cloth to remove any leftover dirt or grease. Rinse the surface and let it air-dry. Pour some clean water over the area, removing any residue from the surface cleaner. Set the bumper on an old towel and leave it until it feels completely dry.

Prep solvent removes contaminants from the area, so make sure to only wipe it on in 1 direction instead of back and forth. Wiping in 2 directions will drag contaminants back into the repair area. Once the solvent is dry, sand the area by hand with 80-grit sandpaper. Consult an auto repair store to find the right adhesive.
