Still others find an engaging and original way to express your interests. You'll need to decide what you want your email address to say about you. A kooky email address could be anything from random words to a few of your basic interests. It could be \"kangaroogirl@example.com\" or \"caffeine.fiend.17@example.com\" or \"green_eggs_and_bacon@example.com\". A personality-based address might be something that speaks to some of your deepest interests or values. For instance: \"mellow.cello@example.com\" or \"because.its.there@example.com\". The goal here is to make people smile and show them what makes you unique. A more professional address might be something that uses your name or your business in an interesting-sounding way. If your name is Billy Bones, you could use \"bbones@example.com\". If your name is Catherine, you could use \"cath.arsis@example.com\". Bear in mind that a professional email address should include your name or business name, and it shouldn't be as wild as your personal email."
