The t-shirt should come down to your mid to lower thighs, and it should be long enough to wear as a dress. You can find inexpensive, plain cotton t-shirts in a variety of colors at stores like Target or Walmart.

If you want, you can use a ruler or yardstick to help you make a straight diagonal line from the bottom of one sleeve to the opposite side of the neck hole. With the sleeve that remains intact, you want to mark it so that, when cut, it will become a sleeveless style. You\u2019ll want to mark this part to be at least three inches wide, so it doesn\u2019t break over time, and so you will be able to glue on your fringe."

Make sure not to cut this point too high on the sides so that the t-shirt still remains a dress-length that you are comfortable with. To make sure you don\u2019t cut your shirt too high: put on a pair of shorts or a skirt you like the length of, put on your t-shirt overtop, and make small marks on each side of the oversized t-shirt at the bottoms of your shorts.

You can find fabric at local hobby stores or repurpose an old blanket or shirt. The size of your dress will determine the amount of fabric you need. Measure the bottom and top perimeters of your dress, where you want to attach your fringe. This is how long you need your strips to be. Most dress won\u2019t need more than half a yard of your fabric of choice. You can cut your strips in multiple sections to get more out of your material.

Then, make a line of hot glue around the top of each strip, and press it onto your t-shirt dress. Alternatives to hot glue or super glue are fabric glue, which will take longer to dry, or sewing the fringe on in a straight line with a sewing machine, if you have the experience."

The belt should be about 8 inches longer than your waist, so you have room to tie it. Or, you can make it 8 or so inches more than twice your waist, so you can double wrap it. This will cinch your t-shirt dress, and make it look more flattering. The belt takes your costume from an oversized t-shirt to a dress. If you want a more intricate belt, braid three thin strips of your fabric together, and knot each of the ends to keep the braid together."
