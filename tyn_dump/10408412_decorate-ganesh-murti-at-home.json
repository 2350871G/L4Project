                    "description": "Immersing murti in water sends Ganesh, who has resided in the idol to listen to your prayers, back to his heavenly abode. Terracotta clay and other natural choices will dissolve during the immersion ritual. Not only is this consistent with the ritual\u2019s spiritual meaning, it\u2019s better for the environment. During Ganesh Chaturthi, hundreds of thousands of idols may be immersed in a single city. Idols made of materials that don't dissolve, such as plaster of Paris, pollute the bodies of water in which they\u2019re immersed. In some areas, laws require Ganesh murti to be made of natural clay. Furthermore, undissolved idols are often removed from bodies of water, gathered into piles, and destroyed, which disrespects Ganesh."

                    "description": "Make the balls roughly the same size between 1/3 and 1/2 of the height you want the idol to be. For instance, if you want a 9 in (23 cm) idol, make each large ball about 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) in diameter. Squish the first ball between your palms to make a flat, \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick circular base, then blend the bottom of the ball for the body onto the base. After smoothing the ball for the body into the base, attach the ball for the head onto the body. At this point, it should look a bit like a snowman sitting on a flat circle, with the joints between the clay balls blended together. Dab your fingers in a small cup of water to moisten the clay and make it more pliable. If you have trouble keeping the sculpture stable, insert a toothpick halfway into the top of the ball for the body. Then place the ball for the head onto the body; the other half of the toothpick goes into the head. The toothpick acts like a frame and holds the 2 balls of clay together."

Then attach 1 end of each tube to the rear and bottom of the body to form the legs. Bend the legs so they curl around the front of the body in a sitting position, then smooth 1 end of each leg to the back of body to form the hip joints.

Blend the arms where they meet the body to make shoulders, and smooth the clay all around where the trunk meets the face. Pinch the ends of the arms to slightly flatten them into hands. Bend one arm upward at the elbow and wrist so the palm faces forward to represent a mudra, or a symbolic hand gesture. Position the other arm so its palm faces up."

Ganesh has a broken tusk, so make one about 1 in (2.5 cm) long and the other about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in length.

Use a glue stick to attach the paper to the cardboard. If you\u2019re painting the cardboard, allow it to dry for 6 to 8 hours before decorating it with craft jewels and beads.

Immersing murti in water sends Ganesh, who has resided in the idol to listen to your prayers, back to his heavenly abode. Terracotta clay and other natural choices will dissolve during the immersion ritual. Not only is this consistent with the ritual\u2019s spiritual meaning, it\u2019s better for the environment. During Ganesh Chaturthi, hundreds of thousands of idols may be immersed in a single city. Idols made of materials that don't dissolve, such as plaster of Paris, pollute the bodies of water in which they\u2019re immersed. In some areas, laws require Ganesh murti to be made of natural clay. Furthermore, undissolved idols are often removed from bodies of water, gathered into piles, and destroyed, which disrespects Ganesh. Roll out 3 large balls of clay for the body, base, and head. Make the balls roughly the same size between 1/3 and 1/2 of the height you want the idol to be. For instance, if you want a 9 in (23 cm) idol, make each large ball about 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) in diameter. Squish the first ball between your palms to make a flat, \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick circular base, then blend the bottom of the ball for the body onto the base. After smoothing the ball for the body into the base, attach the ball for the head onto the body. At this point, it should look a bit like a snowman sitting on a flat circle, with the joints between the clay balls blended together. Dab your fingers in a small cup of water to moisten the clay and make it more pliable. If you have trouble keeping the sculpture stable, insert a toothpick halfway into the top of the ball for the body. Then place the ball for the head onto the body; the other half of the toothpick goes into the head. The toothpick acts like a frame and holds the 2 balls of clay together. Make 2 long cylinders for the legs. Roll 2 pieces of clay into 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long tubes with diameters of about 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm). Then attach 1 end of each tube to the rear and bottom of the body to form the legs. Bend the legs so they curl around the front of the body in a sitting position, then smooth 1 end of each leg to the back of body to form the hip joints. Remember that toothpicks or small sticks can help you attach the body parts to each other if you have trouble keeping the idol stable. Attach the arms and the trunk to the idol. Make 2 more 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tubes with 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) diameters. Attach 1 end of each one to the top of the body to make the arms. Roll a final 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tube with a diameter of about 1 in (2.5 cm), and blend it into the front of the head for the trunk. With wet fingertips, smooth each of these joints.

Place the ears on the sides of the head, then blend the joints between the ears and the head. Add the tusks and a crown. Place 2 small tusks on either side of the trunk, then make a crown by stacking 2 or 3 clay cylinders about 2 in (5.1 cm) in diameter and \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick on top of the head. Ganesh has a broken tusk, so make one about 1 in (2.5 cm) long and the other about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in length. Both tusks should be tubes about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick, and the longer one should taper to a point. Get creative and make small balls and other shapes to adorn the crown with jewels.

Creating a Ganpati Makhar Cut out a cardboard circle that\u2019s larger than the murti. Trace a circular object, like a plate, over the cardboard as a guide. Just make sure it\u2019s large enough to be a suitable backdrop for the murti. Cut out the circle using scissors or a utility knife. The circle will be a backdrop, so it needs to be bigger than the murti. For instance, if your idol is 8 in (20 cm) tall, make the circle at least 10 to 12 in (25 to 30 cm) in diameter.

You won't be immersing the makhar in a body of water, so it's okay if you use paints and other craft items that aren't biodegradable. Glue beads and craft jewels to the cardboard. Using a hot glue gun, place large, colorful jewels around the edge of the circle and perimeter of the base. Create patterns around the larger jewels with rhinestones and other smaller ones. Then glue jewels and chains of beads around the platform\u2019s edges to create a decorative border. Leave most of the circular backdrop blank; just make a jeweled border about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick around the circle\u2019s perimeter. If you\u2019d like, glue a few beads or rhinestones to the backdrop here and there to make stars. Attach the circle to the base and stabilize the joint with cardboard. Cut a rectangular piece of cardboard about 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) long to secure the circle to the platform. Hold the bottom edge of the circle on one side of the platform. Then place the cardboard rectangle on the back of the makhar so it overlaps the joint where the circle and base meet. Once you\u2019ve lined up the pieces, glue them together with the hot glue gun. Hold the circle to the base for 2 to 3 minutes to allow the hot glue to set. Give it 30 to 60 minutes to completely dry.

Although it won\u2019t be seen, you can still paint it or cover it with colorful paper if you\u2019d like. Decorating Your Home Hang colorful dupattas around the makhar. Use thumbtacks to secure the dupattas, or colorful scarves, to the wall behind the makhar. After hanging the dupattas, place a small table in front of the wall, and set the makhar on the table. If you don\u2019t have dupattas, use lengths of any colorful fabric. Place the murti on the makhar after you\u2019ve set the table in place. Adorn Ganesh and the makhar with flowers. Scatter flowers on the table around the makhar, and place vases with flowers on either side. Weave together a small garland of flower, ribbon, or paper, then place it around Ganesh\u2019s neck. Remember that Ganesh is fond of the color red; red hibiscus flowers are often used to adorn Ganesh idols. Erukku flowers and banana leaves are also associated with Ganesh.

        "Idols made of materials that don't dissolve, such as plaster of Paris, pollute the bodies of water in which they\u2019re immersed.",
        "In some areas, laws require Ganesh murti to be made of natural clay.",
        "Furthermore, undissolved idols are often removed from bodies of water, gathered into piles, and destroyed, which disrespects Ganesh.",
        "Roll out 3 large balls of clay for the body, base, and head.",
        "Make the balls roughly the same size between 1/3 and 1/2 of the height you want the idol to be.",
        "For instance, if you want a 9 in (23 cm) idol, make each large ball about 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) in diameter.",
        "Squish the first ball between your palms to make a flat, \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick circular base, then blend the bottom of the ball for the body onto the base.",
        "After smoothing the ball for the body into the base, attach the ball for the head onto the body.",
        "At this point, it should look a bit like a snowman sitting on a flat circle, with the joints between the clay balls blended together.",
        "Dab your fingers in a small cup of water to moisten the clay and make it more pliable.",
        "If you have trouble keeping the sculpture stable, insert a toothpick halfway into the top of the ball for the body.",
        "Then place the ball for the head onto the body; the other half of the toothpick goes into the head.",
        "The toothpick acts like a frame and holds the 2 balls of clay together.",
        "Make 2 long cylinders for the legs.",
        "Roll 2 pieces of clay into 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long tubes with diameters of about 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm).",
        "Then attach 1 end of each tube to the rear and bottom of the body to form the legs.",
        "Bend the legs so they curl around the front of the body in a sitting position, then smooth 1 end of each leg to the back of body to form the hip joints.",
        "Remember that toothpicks or small sticks can help you attach the body parts to each other if you have trouble keeping the idol stable.",
        "Attach the arms and the trunk to the idol.",
        "Make 2 more 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tubes with 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) diameters.",
        "Attach 1 end of each one to the top of the body to make the arms.",
        "Roll a final 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tube with a diameter of about 1 in (2.5 cm), and blend it into the front of the head for the trunk.",
        "With wet fingertips, smooth each of these joints.",
        "Blend the arms where they meet the body to make shoulders, and smooth the clay all around where the trunk meets the face.",
        "Pinch the ends of the arms to slightly flatten them into hands.",
        "Bend one arm upward at the elbow and wrist so the palm faces forward to represent a mudra, or a symbolic hand gesture.",
        "Position the other arm so its palm faces up.",
        "Sculpt an object associated with Ganesh for your murti to hold.",
        "Make a ball of clay about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in diameter.",
        "Mold it into a symbolic object associated with Ganesh, such as rope or uneaten sweets, and place it in the upward facing palm.",
        "To make a rope, simply roll the small ball of clay into a long, thin cylinder.",
        "Next, curl it into a loop and place it on Ganesh's palm.",
        "Make uneaten sweets by dividing the clay ball into 3 or 4 smaller balls, then place them in the upward facing palm.",
        "Blend the ears onto the head.",
        "Make 2 balls about 1 in (2.5 cm) across, then squish each one between your palms to make smooth, flat ears about 2 in (5.1 cm) and \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick.",
        "Place the ears on the sides of the head, then blend the joints between the ears and the head.",
        "Add the tusks and a crown.",
        "Place 2 small tusks on either side of the trunk, then make a crown by stacking 2 or 3 clay cylinders about 2 in (5.1 cm) in diameter and \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick on top of the head.",
        "Ganesh has a broken tusk, so make one about 1 in (2.5 cm) long and the other about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in length.",
        "Both tusks should be tubes about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick, and the longer one should taper to a point.",
        "Get creative and make small balls and other shapes to adorn the crown with jewels.",
        "Draw eyes and markings with a toothpick and safety pin.",
        "With the point of the toothpick, draw small eyes above and on either side of the trunk.",
        "Then add the Aum symbol to the forehead with the pin.",
        "Even with the pin, it might be tough to draw the symbol so small, but just do your best.",
        "You can also make lines to add details to the crown, ears, belly, and other body parts.",
        "Visualize Ganesh or look at an image, and fine tune the murti until you\u2019re happy with your representation of the deity.",
        "The idol will be immersed and dissolved in water, so there\u2019s no need to bake it or otherwise set it.",
        "Use vegetable-based pigments if you choose to paint the murti.",
        "Painting the murti is optional; many people now prefer the natural look of an unpainted clay idol.",
        "If you do paint it, go for natural, vegetable-based paints instead of metallic or chemical-based products.",
        "Vermilion, which is a deep red, would be a good color choice.",
        "It's associated with Ganesh and religious festivals.",
        "Vegetable-based paints are eco-friendly and won\u2019t harm the body of water in which you immerse the murti.",
        "In some areas, idols are required to be unpainted or colored with non-toxic pigments.",
        "Search online for your city's government website to check your local ordinances, or look for newspaper articles on regulations related to Ganesh Chaturthi.",
        "Creating a Ganpati Makhar Cut out a cardboard circle that\u2019s larger than the murti.",
        "Trace a circular object, like a plate, over the cardboard as a guide.",
        "Just make sure it\u2019s large enough to be a suitable backdrop for the murti.",
        "Cut out the circle using scissors or a utility knife.",
        "The circle will be a backdrop, so it needs to be bigger than the murti.",
        "For instance, if your idol is 8 in (20 cm) tall, make the circle at least 10 to 12 in (25 to 30 cm) in diameter.",
        "If you\u2019d like, decorate the circle\u2019s perimeter with small scallop shapes, triangles, circles, or any design you find pleasing.",
        "Use your imagination!",
        "Cut designs directly into the circle\u2019s edge or cut out shapes and glue them around it.",
        "Create a base by cutting designs into a cardboard box.",
        "Choose a cardboard box that\u2019s at least 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wider than the idol's base; a shoe box would probably work well.",
        "To add visual interest, cut decorative arches, triangles, or other designs into the bottoms of each side.",
        "Again, get creative and come up with designs that you find beautiful!",
        "If you're using a box without a lid, cut a piece of cardboard to fit the opening, then paste it over the top.",
        "This part of the makhar is the base or platform upon which Ganesh will sit.",
        "Paint the circle and base or cover them with colorful paper.",
        "Choose vibrant paints or construction paper to color the makhar.",
        "Sky blue or pale turquoise would work well for the circle and top of the base, as the murti would stand out well against a light color.",
        "Ganesh enjoys the color red, so that\u2019s a good choice for borders and other details.",
        "If you\u2019re using construction paper, cut the paper to fit the circle and the base\u2019s sides and top.",
        "Use a glue stick to attach the paper to the cardboard.",
        "If you\u2019re painting the cardboard, allow it to dry for 6 to 8 hours before decorating it with craft jewels and beads.",
        "You won't be immersing the makhar in a body of water, so it's okay if you use paints and other craft items that aren't biodegradable.",
        "Glue beads and craft jewels to the cardboard.",
        "Using a hot glue gun, place large, colorful jewels around the edge of the circle and perimeter of the base.",
        "Create patterns around the larger jewels with rhinestones and other smaller ones.",
        "Then glue jewels and chains of beads around the platform\u2019s edges to create a decorative border.",
        "Leave most of the circular backdrop blank; just make a jeweled border about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick around the circle\u2019s perimeter.",
        "If you\u2019d like, glue a few beads or rhinestones to the backdrop here and there to make stars.",
        "Attach the circle to the base and stabilize the joint with cardboard.",
        "Cut a rectangular piece of cardboard about 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) long to secure the circle to the platform.",
        "Hold the bottom edge of the circle on one side of the platform.",
        "Then place the cardboard rectangle on the back of the makhar so it overlaps the joint where the circle and base meet.",
        "Once you\u2019ve lined up the pieces, glue them together with the hot glue gun.",
        "Hold the circle to the base for 2 to 3 minutes to allow the hot glue to set.",
        "Give it 30 to 60 minutes to completely dry.",
        "Since it\u2019s on the back of the makhar, the cardboard piece that holds the circle to the base won\u2019t be visible.",
        "Although it won\u2019t be seen, you can still paint it or cover it with colorful paper if you\u2019d like.",
        "Decorating Your Home Hang colorful dupattas around the makhar.",
        "Use thumbtacks to secure the dupattas, or colorful scarves, to the wall behind the makhar.",
        "After hanging the dupattas, place a small table in front of the wall, and set the makhar on the table.",
        "If you don\u2019t have dupattas, use lengths of any colorful fabric.",
        "Place the murti on the makhar after you\u2019ve set the table in place.",
        "Adorn Ganesh and the makhar with flowers.",
        "Scatter flowers on the table around the makhar, and place vases with flowers on either side.",
        "Weave together a small garland of flower, ribbon, or paper, then place it around Ganesh\u2019s neck.",
        "Remember that Ganesh is fond of the color red; red hibiscus flowers are often used to adorn Ganesh idols.",
        "Erukku flowers and banana leaves are also associated with Ganesh.",
        "Place diyas, candles, and strings of lights around your home.",
        "Diyas are oil lamps that are lit during puja (prayer) and are typically made of brass.",
        "Place a diya by the makhar, and light it before you perform puja to Ganesh.",
        "No Hindu festival is complete without light, so decorate your entire home with candles and strings of LED lights to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi.",
        "Your decorations can be as ornate as your budget and time allow.",
        "If you\u2019d like, simply place diyas and votive candles around your home.",
        "You can also go all out and run strings of light all around doorways and the edges where walls meet the ceiling.",
        "Welcome family and friends with vibrant door hangings.",
        "Purchase store-bought beaded door hangings, or make your own.",
        "You could tie and hang long strands of beads from the craft store, or string together ribbons, flowers, and lights.",
        "Hang your decorations on your entrance and, if you'd like, on doors throughout your home.",
        "Use thumbtacks or small nails to attach your door hangings to the top of the door or jamb.",
        "Wind chimes could also make an interesting addition to your door hangings."
