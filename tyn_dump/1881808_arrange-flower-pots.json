Once you\u2019ve chosen a spot, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what kind of plants you need. For example, if it is a spacious area, you can put large pots with tall plants like elephant ear or agave. If you want to work with hanging plants to line a porch, try a sweet potato vine or wishbone flower. You also want to consider whether the area you are placing your pots in gets lots of sun or very little, as you will have to place different types of plants in those areas."

For example, if you have a red door, maybe a pot with deep purples and whites would be complementary for that area. It will stand out against the red of the door and really bring the eye of any visitor to that space. Or, if you are placing an arrangement on your deck, which is deep brown, any bright color like yellows or oranges will appear striking against the wood. You can also play with the colors of your pots. Try mixing up the lighter and darker shades of some terracotta pots or mixing white and black pots for a chic and sophisticated look."

This should be where you decide the size of the plants and how they\u2019ll fit together in a pot. There are three basic kinds of plants - tall/upright, broad/bushy, and trailing. Tall or upright plants are going to continuously grow upwards, while broad/bushy plants are going to grow outward. Trailing plants, on the other hand, will spill out over the sides of the pot in every direction. Think about how often you\u2019ll be able to prune or cut down the plants before you decide which ones you\u2019d like to have in your pots."

                    "description": "Similar to choosing the size and growing pattern of a plant, it\u2019s important to know which plants grow well where. For example, an area that gets a lot of sun is going to need plants that are able to survive direct light. You don\u2019t want a pot mixed with plants that need direct light along with plants that need shade, this will make keeping the plants alive and healthy very difficult. Instead, you need to match up growing conditions before placing them. Consider how much light or shade a plant needs, as well as the amount of water, and the condition of the soil. Some good plants to grow in partially shaded areas are rhododendrons, hydrangeas, or bay laurel. If you are planning to place your pots in a space with direct sunlight, try rock rose, silver queen, and lavender. Look for plants labeled as \u201cannuals,\u201d or \u201cbedding plants,\u201d as these are the plants that will survive a whole season rather than just a few weeks."

However, most focal plants should be the largest component in a pot and sit higher than the other plants. Once you\u2019ve chosen your focal plant you can build the rest of the arrangement around it.
