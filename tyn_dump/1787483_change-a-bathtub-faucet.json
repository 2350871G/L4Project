Turn on one of the handles in your bathtub so the water empties out of the spout. There will be a small amount of water leftover from your pipes that will drain. When the water stops coming out of the spout, turn the faucet off again. Pry the index from the stem with the end of a screwdriver. The index is in the middle of your handle and is usually a coin-sized plastic cover. Slide the end of a flathead screwdriver under the edge of the index and pry it out. The size of your index will vary depending on the handles you have.Tip: Cover the tub drain while you remove the index so it doesn\u2019t accidentally fall in.

Bring your old stems and handles with you when you look for a new faucet. Make sure to buy stems that are exactly the same as your old ones so they fit onto your pipes easily. Then select the handle that matches the rest of your bathroom. You can buy stems and handles in the plumbing section of your local home improvement store.

Repeat the process for any additional handles you have in your tub. If your handles aren\u2019t watertight, then you may need to caulk around them to prevent water from entering your walls. Attaching the Spout Buy a new spout that fits onto your pipe. Go to your local home improvement store and look at the spouts that are available. Look for something that matches the handle in your tub. Make sure the new spout is longer than the measurement you took on your pipe. Use a spout that\u2019s attached the same way as your old one or else it may not stay secure. Bring your old spout with you so you can choose something similar in size.
