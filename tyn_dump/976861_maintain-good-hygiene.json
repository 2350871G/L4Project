Try brushing once in the morning and once before you go to bed, and spend at least two minutes each time you brush. It will keep you fresh the whole day. If you are constantly on the go, have a travel toothbrush in you purse or briefcase so you can pop into the bathroom at work.

Using a short piece of floss, get in between your teeth and along the gum line, using your fingers to add pressure. Take to your orthodontist about ways to floss if you have braces, such as dental threads. Be sure to clean in between your back teeth too, using the floss around all sides of the molars.
