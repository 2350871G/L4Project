If you've never made pancakes, start by making the batter as if you were making a very thick gravy. Test to see if it's of the consistency that you want, then add dry mixture or fluid to adjust it to be thicker or thinner. Be prepared to experiment a little. For example: For a single deep Belgian waffle, you'd start with about 1/2 cup of fluid and add 3 to 4 level tablespoons of the dry mix while mixing and add dry mix or fluid until it gets to the thickness you want."

As already noted, you'll be wanting a thick, pourable batter for waffles, with it being a little thinner for pancakes, and very thin for crepes. Cobbler recipes can use this batter. If you mix fresh fruit, sugar, and a thickener (your own recipe) for a fruit cobbler you can use this recipe for the topping. Just use less fluid to make a very thick paste that you can spread with a wet spoon or spatula. I like to add about twice the sugar to sweeten the final topping.
