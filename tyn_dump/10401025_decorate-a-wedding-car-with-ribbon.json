        "You can knot the ribbons and streamers around the top of the antenna or use tape to attach them.",
        "Make sure ribbons are only a few feet long, since longer ribbons may snag on objects or bother other drivers on the road.",
        "You can use as many ribbons you want\u2014just remember to keep your choices pretty simple so that you don't obstruct the driver's view!",

        "A safer, more modern take on this is to tie plastic soda bottles to the ends of the ribbons.",
        "A strong double-knot should secure the plastic bottle to the ribbon, but you can also use hot glue.",
        "You could also use small, heart-shaped Mylar balloons instead of plastic bottles for a quieter option!",
