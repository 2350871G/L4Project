                    "description": "Because your bangs will be straight across, you won't need to part your hair to one side as you usually do. Take a comb and place the tip of it an inch or two above your hairline, in the center of your head. You may need to go a bit further back, such as one inch or even to the high, flat part of your head where a comb will balance. Then, draw a downward diagonal line from the center of your head to the end of your eyebrow. Make sure that this is before the recession area where your hair drops down along the side of your head. Then, repeat on the other side. Pull your bangs section towards the middle to separate it from the rest of your hair. After you've done this, you should have a triangle-like shape with the point a few inches above your hair line and the sides of the triangle coming down along the sides of your forehead. Once you've created a part, you'll want to comb your bangs forward and then pin the rest of your hair back or put it in a ponytail to keep it out of your face."

You can also try using a flat iron on your bangs to make them straight. It's important that your bangs don't have any wave to them, because you want to be able to get them as even as possible on your forehead. Keep in mind that doing this with dry hair will be more accurate, but it may also be more difficult. Mist your hair all over with water to get the best results."

                    "description": "Straight bangs can come in all different styles, so you'll want to figure out exactly how you want them to look before you cut them. Some people like their bangs to go straight across their forehead above their eyebrows for an edgier look, and others like longer bangs that angle down as they meet with the rest of their hair."

                    "headline": "Begin cutting your bangs.",
                    "description": "Taking the hair you've gathered between your pointer finger and middle finger, create a straight line that is even with the tip of your nose. Your bangs will not end up this long, as they would cover your eyes, but this will be a good starting point so you don't have to make a perfect cut right away. Cut the hair below your fingers, but make sure you only cut the hair that is pinched between the front part of your fingers. You can also use tape to create a straight cut. Place a piece of tape along your bangs, and cut a straight line below the tape at the desired length for your bangs. This is an excellent technique to ensure a straight line. Getting a straight line free hand requires very precise cutting and very sharp shears, so you may end up with a crooked line by doing a free hand cut. Continue to cut your bangs in 1/4 inch increments until they are your desired length. If your bangs are damp, comb them gently to avoid stretching the hair. Cut them 1/2 inch longer than the desired length because when they dry they will shrink up. If you want to angle your bangs downward at the ends, cut straight across from the middle of one eye to the middle of the opposite eye. Then, once you've reached that point, begin to cut at a downward angle. Then repeat on the other eye, cutting at a downward angle until you've reached the rest of your hair. You can cut a very steep angle, or you can cut a slight angle in your hair -- it all depends on how dramatic you want the diagonal of your bangs to be. Sometimes it helps to take your bangs and twist them once in your fingers, and then cut the straight line. This just pushes the hair tighter together, so you can just make one or two cuts. It also creates a small arch in your bangs, making them shorter in the front and longer on the sides. Make sure to cross check the length before you finish cutting. Check in the mirror and by placing strands of hair side by side to see if they are even."

If using a blow dryer, grab a round brush and pull bangs from underneath, up at the roots toward the ceiling. Then, once or twice pull your round brush underneath your bangs, from the roots of your bangs to the tips, in an arching motion to create volume. You can also do this same motion with a flat iron. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, dry your bangs with a flat brush. Hold the brush close to your forehead and move it behind the dryer from roots to ends.

Lightly mist your hair with a spray bottle and comb through so that your bangs are flat. If your hair is naturally wavy or straight, cutting bangs in dry hair is best so that you won't cut them too short. Never soak your bangs or make them completely wet. Your hair is longer when it is wet, so anytime you cut wet hair, when it dries it will be shorter. To avoid cutting bangs that are too short, try to cut your bangs with slightly wet or dry hair. If your hair is very wet before you cut your bangs, blow dry them until they are 80% dry. When blow drying, make sure you are brushing bangs straight down, or in the opposite direction of your part. Don't blow dry bangs downward in the direction they normally would lie. This will create a \"rainbow effect\" in which your bangs have a high arch to them. It's difficult to cut bangs when they are like this, so it's better to create some volume in the opposite direction."

Hold your bangs between your pointer and middle finger and cut the hair below your fingers. If you aren't sure how long you want your bangs, start by cutting at the tip of your nose and ending in a diagonal at the bottom of your ear. This will create long, side swept bangs. Make sure you are using scissors specifically designed for hair, as this will give you the best cut. If you want shorter bangs, start near the top of the nose, in line with the eye, and cut at a downward diagonal towards the middle of your ear. Always cut bangs longer when you start off -- you can always cut them shorter as you go, but you don't want your first cut to be too short, because there's no way to rewind from there. You can try cutting in 1/2 inch increments to make sure you don't cut too much of your bang off."

        "If using a blow dryer, grab a round brush and pull bangs from underneath, up at the roots toward the ceiling.",
        "Then, once or twice pull your round brush underneath your bangs, from the roots of your bangs to the tips, in an arching motion to create volume.",
        "You can also do this same motion with a flat iron.",
        "If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, dry your bangs with a flat brush.",
        "Hold the brush close to your forehead and move it behind the dryer from roots to ends.",
        "This will avoid adding more volume to your bangs.",
        "Cutting Side Bangs Part your hair.",
        "Take a fine-tooth comb and brush your hair until it is smooth and tangle-free.",
        "For side bangs, you will need to create a side part.",
        "Part your hair to the side it naturally falls on.",
        "Pull hair forward.",
        "Taking the tip of a comb, draw a part an inch or two behind your hairline,  perpendicular to your side part.",
        "(In other words, from side-to-side, rather than front-to-back.)",
        "If you are looking for thicker bangs, you can draw a part farther back.",
        "This will help separate your bangs from the rest of your hair.",
        "Find the highest tip of your eyebrow.",
        "This is generally towards the center of your eyebrow, or the highlight of the brow, and it will help you gauge the width of your bangs.",
        "If you are starting off with bangs from scratch, measure a line upwards from the highest tip of your eyebrow to your hairline.",
        "Make a part where that line ends.",
        "Move the hair on one side of the part towards the middle of your forehead and pin the hair on the side of your head back to keep it out of the way.",
        "After you have done this step, you should now have a section of hair in the front center of your face that is separated from the rest of your hair.",
        "If you already have bangs, you should have a width already determined, so take your preexisting longer bangs and part them towards the middle, also separating them from the hair line.",
        "Pull your bangs up and look at them from the side.",
        "They should be about one to two inches thick.",
        "If you want thicker bangs, pull more hair forward from the horizontal part behind your hairline, and if you want thinner bangs, do the opposite by pulling less hair forward from your hairline part.",
        "Pin back the rest of your hair.",
        "Pull back the rest of your hair with a clip or bobby pins to separate it from your bangs.",
        "This will make it easier to cut your bangs without worrying about cutting the rest of your hair.",
        "Make sure your bangs are straight.",
        "This may require you to dampen your hair with a spray bottle if your hair is naturally curly and your bangs have some bounce.",
        "Lightly mist your hair with a spray bottle and comb through so that your bangs are flat.",
        "If your hair is naturally wavy or straight, cutting bangs in dry hair is best so that you won't cut them too short.",
        "Never soak your bangs or make them completely wet.",
        "Your hair is longer when it is wet, so anytime you cut wet hair, when it dries it will be shorter.",
        "To avoid cutting bangs that are too short, try to cut your bangs with slightly wet or dry hair.",
        "If your hair is very wet before you cut your bangs, blow dry them until they are 80% dry.",
        "When blow drying, make sure you are brushing bangs straight down, or in the opposite direction of your part.",
        "Don't blow dry bangs downward in the direction they normally would lie.",
        "This will create a \"rainbow effect\" in which your bangs have a high arch to them.",
        "It's difficult to cut bangs when they are like this, so it's better to create some volume in the opposite direction.",
        "Determine the length of your bangs.",
        "Before you cut your bangs you'll want to decide how long you want your bangs.",
        "You may want bangs that cover your eye, or you might want bangs that start above your eyebrow.",
        "If you're not sure, you can always start with longer bangs and cut them shorter.",
        "Cut at an angle.",
        "Section your hair along a diagonal line and pull it perpendicular to that line.",
        "In other words, you hair should be pulled out to the side of your head at a 45 degree angle.",
        "Then, bring any other hair you will be cutting out to this angle before cutting.",
        "Hold your bangs between your pointer and middle finger and cut the hair below your fingers.",
        "If you aren't sure how long you want your bangs, start by cutting at the tip of your nose and ending in a diagonal at the bottom of your ear.",
        "This will create long, side swept bangs.",
        "Make sure you are using scissors specifically designed for hair, as this will give you the best cut.",
        "If you want shorter bangs, start near the top of the nose, in line with the eye, and cut at a downward diagonal towards the middle of your ear.",
        "Always cut bangs longer when you start off -- you can always cut them shorter as you go, but you don't want your first cut to be too short, because there's no way to rewind from there.",
        "You can try cutting in 1/2 inch increments to make sure you don't cut too much of your bang off.",
        "Create a natural look.",
        "After you have cut your bangs you may notice that there is a very straight line in your bangs.",
        "This tends to look awkward and unnatural, so you may want to give your bangs a little definition.",
        "Lift the hair back up to a 45 degree angle and cut parallel to the strands of hair in your bangs, making small snips at the tips of your bangs.",
        "If your hair is really thick or you want your bangs to have an even more natural look, you can use a razor made for hair or a hair thinning tool to thin out the ends of your bangs.",
        "Style your bangs.",
        "Use a blow dryer and a round brush, brushing your bangs up from the roots towards the ceiling or towards the back of your head.",
        "You never want to blow dry your bangs by brushing them straight down as this will leave your bangs with little volume.",
        "You can also run a flat iron through your bangs by pulling the flat iron upwards at your roots to create volume.",
        "You can also blow dry your bangs in the opposite direction of where they naturally fall to make them lay flat and give them a bit of curl at the bottom.",
        "As they are close to being dry, flip them back over and blow dry as usual."
