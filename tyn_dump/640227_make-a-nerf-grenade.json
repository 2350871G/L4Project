Tape the darts to the Flatball and cover half of each dart with tape. You should tape the darts between the middle and the top of the Flatball. Flatten and time the Flatball and throw it on the ground. When you place it on the ground, be sure to put more time on the timer, and run to avoid being hit. Frisbee Method Buy the materials needed. You're going to need a frisbee and rubber band. Make sure you have 1 inch (2.5 cm)-1 and a half inch stefans. Fold the frisbee in half.  Fold one of the sides over the other. It should look kind of like a triangular cup. Put the darts inside.  Close the other half and put the rubber band around it.  Remove the rubber band and throw.  Keep track of where the darts go.  Rubber Band Method Take 15 darts. Darts that have already been dented or torn by jams will work fine, and you won't have to waste ammunition. Secure them into a bunch with a folded-over rubber band.  Roll the band up towards the tips until the darts start to splay out at the back, but not so much it explodes in your hand.  Thread another rubber band through the keychain ring.  Wrap the band around the bottom.  Pull off the keyring band and throw it!  Disc Method Buy the materials needed. You'll need 10 discs and two rubber bands. Stack six discs and wrap a rubber band around it vertically.  Wrap another one on the other side so that the top looks like a cross.
