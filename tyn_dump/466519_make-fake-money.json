Get a coffee cup and fill it halfway up with hot water. Add in 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of instant coffee and stir quickly. Then, pour this mixture into a shallow bowl or pan. This should leave you with a deep brown colored liquid. If you want your money to only have a slight brownish tint, then you can add a bit more warm water to the cup. If you don\u2019t have instant coffee on hand, you can instead use a tea bag steeped in a cup of warm water. To create an even more complex color, squeeze out 1-2 drops of green food coloring into the mug and stir quickly. This will give your currency a greenish tint."
