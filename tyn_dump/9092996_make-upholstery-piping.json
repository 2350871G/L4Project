For instance, if your cord and seam allowance are each \u00bd\u201d (1.3cm), the width of your strips will be equal to 2 inches (5.1cm). The seam allowance is the space between the seam and the end of the fabric. It allows pieces of a pattern to sit together properly. Fold a corner of the fabric towards the selvage. The selvage is the small strip at the end of a square of fabric that bears the manufacturer\u2019s name. As you bring an opposite corner of the fabric towards this strip, you\u2019ll create a 45 degree fold in the fabric, also known as the bias. While the bias is technically any diagonal line on your fabric, the true bias goes from the selvage to the opposite end of the fabric, intersecting with the grain. Crease the line and cut.

Cutting your fabric this way will make for smoother piping than cutting straight strips. Cutting along the bias leaves you with fabric that\u2019s more pliable and less likely to fray at the edges.

Use a fabric pencil and ruler to draw a parallel line marking the other edge of the strip. Use your scissors to cut along this line.

Lay the strips right side up; you should see the ends of the strips passing each other. One should be vertical, the other crossing it horizontally. Use a straight stitch to sew the strips together. The stitch should go at a 45 degree angle, parallel to the horizontal strip\u2019s diagonal edge. You\u2019ll be able to turn multiple strips into one long section of fabric.

After folding the fabric over, make sure to hold it tightly. The edges should line up together nicely. Insert pins to keep the fabric in place.
