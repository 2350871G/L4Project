Add 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 cups of milk to the eggs and stir the ingredients thoroughly to combine them. Sift the flour, salt, and the baking powder. Sift 2 cups of flour, 1/3 tsp. of salt, and 2 tsp. of baking powder together. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture. Add more flour to the egg mixture and continue to beat it in until all of the flour is incorporated into the egg mixture. The batter should be smooth and not too thick. Put your finger in the bottom opening of the funnel and fill it with one cup of batter. Place the cup of batter in the bottom of the funnel. Heat 4 tbsp. of vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. The vegetable oil will fry the funnel cake and give it a rich texture and taste. Pour the batter into the oil in the pan. Remove your finger from the funnel and swirl it around in a circular motion, or in a criss-cross motion, until you've made a funnel cake patter that fills the pan and is about the size of an ordinary plate. Fry one side of the batter until it's golden brown. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes. Use a pair of tongs to check when the batter is golden brown. Flip the batter over and fry the other side. Use the tongs to flip the batter over and fry it until it's golden brown just like the first side. This should take less time than it did for the first side to fry -- just about one minute. Remove the funnel cake and drain it on a paper towel.

Beat the ingredients well with a wooden spoon after you add each egg. Spoon the dough into a large resealable plastic bag, Use scissors to snip a 1/4 to 1/2\" hole in one corner of the bag.  Pipe the dough into twelve 3-4\" circles on the baking sheet. Make swirls, criss-cross patterns, or just free form patterns into the small circles to make them resemble funnel cakes. Bake the ingredients for about 20 minutes. When the funnel cake is ready, it should be puffed and golden brown. Transfer it to a wire rack. Sift 2 tbsp. of powdered sugar over the warm cakes. Serve.
