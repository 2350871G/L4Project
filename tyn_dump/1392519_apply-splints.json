Watch for changes that happen after the splint is applied \u2013 that\u2019s one way to know the splint is too tight, or is otherwise causing problems. Checking the CSM before splinting gives you a baseline, and information to tell emergency services. Color: Watch for reddening or paling of the injured extremity. If fingers or toes turn white, it means blood flow is restricted. Loosen or remove splinting right away to prevent serious complications. Sensation: Check the injured person\u2019s ability to feel sensations to make sure they\u2019re not having nerve problems. Have them close their eyes or look away, and touch each toe or finger of the affected limb. Use firm pressure with your thumb and ask them to tell you when you\u2019re touching them. Then check for sharp sensation by applying pressure to each digit with a pin or sharp stick. Movement: A splint should immobilize a limb, but not prevent movement entirely. If the person loses ability to move a limb once a splint is applied, it could mean that swelling is causing the splint and wrap to be too tight. Remove the splint quickly."

Wait for the splint material to stop bubbling before removing it. Do NOT use warm water. Splinting material sets faster when warm water is used, and the faster the material sets the more heat it produces as a byproduct. Using cool water will greatly reduce the risk of burns to the patient as the splint sets. Fiberglass splinting material sets more quickly. If you\u2019re using room-temperature water or fiberglass material, you\u2019ll have to work quickly. Remember to wear gloves if working with fiberglass. \u201dSqueegee\u201d the splint material so it\u2019s moist and flat. Take out the wet splint material and squeeze it gently to remove excess water. Do not wad or ball up the material \u2013 hold the material up with one hand and clamp the material with your first two fingers of the other hand. Apply gentle pressure as you \u201csqueegee\u201d your fingers down the strip, squeezing out extra water and keeping the material as flat and smooth as possible. Plaster will still be wet and messy, but should not be dripping water; fiberglass will feel damp. Lay the material on a flat surface and smooth any wrinkles out of the splint layers. Make sure all the layers are flat. Wrinkled and bumpy material will put pressure on parts of the body when it dries, which can cause pressure sores, nerve injury, and pain. Apply the splinting material. Ensure the limb is in its proper posturing. Place the wet splinting material over the padding, and use the palm of your hand to smooth the material into position. When you reach the end of the splint, fold the next layer back on itself to create the following layer. Repeat this until the splint has the appropriate number of layers. Do not use your fingers to mold the splint; this can create dimpling and cause pressure sores and nerve problems. It\u2019s very important to keep the splint material as smooth as possible. Splints are applied to only one or at most two sides of an extremity; they are NOT circumferential. Full, circumferential casts can be applied to an injured limb once all swelling has gone down. Fold back the edges of the stockinette and padding. Once your splint is applied, fold back the extra length of padding and stockinette over the edge of the splint. This should create a smooth edge. Check for any discomfort, pressure points, or vascular problems before finishing the splint. Re-perform neurovascular tests at this time to ensure the splint is comfortable and not compromising blood flow or nerve conduction or applying more pressure to certain areas. It\u2019s better to re-do an ill-fitting splint now than before it dries, and much better to fix a splint than cause medical problems later. Let the splint dry and apply an elastic wrap. Ensure that the limb is postured correctly. Wait for the splint material to dry completely. Then apply an elastic wrap around the splinted limb, from farther from the body to closer to the body. This should keep the splint in place and provide some support, but should not be constricting. Be very careful to avoid wrinkles, and to keep the wrap evenly layered throughout. Secure the wrap with medical tape or clips. Do not tape around the splint in a circle when finishing it. Tape along the sides of the splint to allow room for swelling. Provide other necessary equipment to your patient. If the splint covers the elbow, it may benefit the patient to use a sling. Provide crutches for any lower extremity injuries that require non-weight bearing. Ice packs can help reduce pain and swelling.",

        "Move the limb as little \u2013 and as gently \u2013 as possible to get it into a position in which you can splint it.",
        "Preferably, do not move it at all and apply the splint the best you can in the limb\u2019s current position.",
        "Place the splint to minimize movement of the injured area.",
        "In an emergency, you do not have to know the exact right way to splint an injured joint.",
        "Try to minimize movement of the affected joint or limb.",
        "The best way to do this is to apply a splint to the joint both above and below the injury.",
        "For instance, if the forearm is injured, apply a splint that extends from above the elbow to below the wrist.",
        "Secure the splint just below the wrist and above the elbow for best support.",
        "If the elbow or shoulder is injured, tuck the arm close to the body and wrap the whole torso, immobilizing the limb against the body.",

        "This provides the best support.",
        "For instance, tie the splint below the ankle and above the knee for leg injuries.",
        "If using tape, try to tape over the padding and not directly on the person\u2019s skin.",
        "Try not to tie or tape something directly over the injury.",
        "Use a SAM splint, if available.",
        "A good outdoors first-aid kit can include a SAM splint, a moldable aluminum strip between two layers of padding that hardens once put into position.",
        "They are small, inexpensive, and light-weight, and can be a good temporizing measure in an emergency; though they do not provide much support.",
        "If using a SAM splint, follow these general guidelines:\nMold the splint on someone of similar size and shape to the injured person, not directly on the injured person.",
        "Once the splint is shaped, apply it to the injured person and hold it in place with anything you have: a sock, torn shirt, tape, cling film, or elastic bandages.",
        "Do not wrap the splint too tightly; it should be snug, but allow room for swelling.",
        "Preparing Your Patient for Splinting (Medical Professionals Only) Assess the injury for range of motion and nerve damage.",
        "Before splinting, check the injured limb and document any damage to the patient\u2019s skin or surrounding area.",
        "Most importantly, check their nerves and blood vessels for injury \u2013 you will need to compare this after splinting to make sure the splint is not compromising blood flow, nerve conduction, or swelling.",
        "This assessment will also help you to determine whether a splint vs. a cast is appropriate.",
        "Let the patient know that they should seek immediate medical attention if they experience any tingling, loss of sensation, increased pain, delayed capillary refill, dusky appearance to skin, or severe swelling.",
        "Decide what type of splint to use.",
        "Different splint methods are used for different injuries.",
        "This is not a comprehensive list, so be sure to study or consult a trained professional to establish the correct type and posture for splinting.",
        "Generally, consider these guidelines:\nUse an ulnar gutter splint for Boxer\u2019s fractures (fracture of the distal 5th metacarpal) and other injuries to the 4th and 5th fingers and metacarpals.",
        "Use a sugar tong splint for fractures of the humerus.",
        "Use a long-arm posterior splint for elbow injuries.",
        "Short-arm splints may suffice for distal forearm and wrist injuries.",
        "Use a thumb spica splint for thumb injuries.",
        "Splinting and taping one finger to another, one leg to another, or an arm to the torso can effectively immobilize a limb.",
        "Protect the patient\u2019s clothing.",
        "Plaster splint material can produce dust, and water may drip from the material onto the patient.",
        "If time and urgency allow, drape the patient\u2019s clothes with a sheet, towel, or cloth to protect their clothing.",
        "Applying a Professional Splint Gather your splinting materials.",
        "To do a proper, professional splint you will require certain medical materials.",
        "Gather all of your materials before beginning your splint.",

        "Make sure the stockinette fits snuggly, and smooth out any wrinkles.",
        "If it\u2019s too tight and constricts blood flow at all, use a wider stockinette.",
        "If a lot of swelling is expected, skip using the stockinette or any circumferential materials.",
        "In this case, thicker, wider padding material should be used.",
        "Ensure the limb is in the appropriate position.",
        "Injuries heal best, and complications are avoided, when the limb is splinted into the appropriate position.",
        "Specific injuries require specific posturing, so be sure to learn or consult a professional before splinting.",
        "Follow these basic guidelines:\nPlace the wrist in slight extension and ulnar deviation.",
        "Let the hand rest in position as if holding a can of soda.",
        "When using a thumb spica splint, place the wrist at about 20\u00b0 of extension and flex the thumb slightly.",

        "For long-leg casts, allow the knee to flex slightly.",
        "Wrap padding around the limb over the stockinette.",
        "Splint padding is applied between the stockinette and splinting material to allow the limb to swell.",
        "Take your roll of padding material and wrap it around the limb circumferentially \u2013 snugly, but not so tight that it impairs blood flow.",
        "Roll from one end of the limb to the other end.",
        "Each roll should overlap the previous roll by 50%.",
        "Apply 2-3 layers of wrapping.",
        "Allow for 2-3cm of extra padding on both sides of where the splint will end.",
        "As you wrap the limb, apply extra padding to the edges of where the splint will be, between the fingers or toes, and over bony areas such as the heel, malleolus, elbow, and ulnar styloid.",
        "This helps prevent pressure sores.",
        "Keep the padding flat and wrinkle-free.",
        "If it creases, remove and reapply it.",
        "Measure your splinting material.",
        "Measure the amount of splint material you need \u2013 lay dry plaster splint material next to the injured body part to judge the length.",
        "The width should be a little wider than the diameter of the body part being splinted, and 1-2cm longer than you want the end product to be.",
        "Cut or tear the appropriate length of dry splint material you need.",
        "The splint should end up being slightly shorter than the padding.",
        "Decide on the splint thickness.",
        "A splint generally ranges from 8-15 layers of dry splinting material.",
        "On average, use 6-10 layers for upper extremities and 12-15 layers for lower extremities.",
        "The necessary thickness depends on which body part needs splinting, the patient's size, and how strong the splint needs to be.",
        "Use the minimal number of layers necessary to get the right splint strength.",
        "Use fewer layers for petite patients or non-weight bearing injuries.",
