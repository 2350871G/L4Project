Start by using a tuner to understand what your trumpet should sound like, when perfectly in tune.

Essentially, any note played using the third valve may need to be tuned with the third valve slide. The low D and low G played with the 1st and 3rd valves almost always need to be played using the third valve slide to tune. Low C# and low F# played with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valves may also need to be tuned with the third valve slide. D and C# should almost always be played using the third valve slide to keep the trumpet in tune. They should receive the majority of attention, when you\u2019re first learning to use the slide for tuning. In many cases the low F# and low G are so low they do not need to be tuned using the third valve slide."

        "Most trumpets and cornets come equipped with water keys or \u201cspit valves.\u201d To clear the third valve water key, press down on the third valve, open the water key, and blow into the trumpet.",
        "Water will be released from the key.",
        "If the gurgling sound continues, empty your tuning slide water key by pushing down all three valves, holding open the water key, and blowing.",
        "Wash your trumpet weekly.",
        "You\u2019ll need to completely clean your trumpet, especially if you\u2019re practicing for at least an hour a day as is advised.",
        "Fill a bathtub with warm water.",
        "Remove all of the valves, caps, and slides from the trumpet, and place the body of the trumpet in water.",
        "Let the main portion of the trumpet soak for about half an hour.",
        "In the meant time you should carefully clean, oil, and grease your valves and slides as necessary.",

        "Avoid eating or drinking before playing the trumpet.",
        "Apart from water, avoid consumption of any food or beverage that might introduce sugars and other foreign debris to your trumpet.",
