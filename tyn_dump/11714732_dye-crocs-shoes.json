You can\u2019t realistically do this inside without getting paint and water all over the place, so take your bin out outside. Fill your plastic container 4/5 of the way with lukewarm water. You need a little room at the top of the bin. When you submerge your shoe, it will displace some of your water. If the bucket is too full, some of the water and paint will spill over.

Keep the can tilted at an angle while you\u2019re spraying to avoid sputtering and prevent uneven layers of paint. You don\u2019t need a dust mask or respirator since you\u2019re doing this outside, but you can wear one if the paint fumes tend to bother you. You can use a single color to dye your Crocs a different shade or use multiple cans of paint to create a unique pattern. If you want to dye your Crocs a solid color, spray your paint into the water for 30-40 seconds until the paint covers the entire surface of the water."

You can use anywhere from 2-3 additional colors for this. Spray each color in the middle of your previous color for 5-10 seconds. Allow the paint to spread around in the water after you spray each layer. The surface of the water should be completely covered with paint by the time you\u2019re done adding your paints. If you use more than 4 colors, the paint may begin to mix together in the water. The paints will stay separated if you use 4 or fewer, though. For a tie-dye look, use blue, red, yellow, and green. You can spray these colors in a circular pattern away from the center of the water to mix them together like a classic tie-dye shirt! Any color combination can work for this since the paint won\u2019t mix unless you use more than 4 colors. For a brighter combination, use a mixture of red, yellow, pink, and orange. For a cooler color combination, stick with darker colors like blue, purple, black, and green."
