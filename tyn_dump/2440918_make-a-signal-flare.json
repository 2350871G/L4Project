Signal flare #2 Mix 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 3/4 cup potassium nitrate in a shake-able container or jar. Shake and turn the container to allow the material to be thoroughly mixed. Light a propane camp stove in a safe, outdoor location. Crank the flame down to a low level. Most propane stoves will produce a 1/4-inch high flame at this level. Place the flare mixture in a heavy skillet and heat it slowly. Stir the mixture constantly. As the flare gum heats it will take on the consistency of melted plastic or chewed gum.
