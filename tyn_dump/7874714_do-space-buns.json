        "Repeat this step for the other pigtail too.",
        "For a more unique look, try a 2-strand rope braid instead.",
        "This works especially well for natural hair.",
        "Pull on the outer loops of the braids to volumize them, if desired.",
        "You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to add volume to your hair, especially if it is very thin.",
        "Starting from the bottom of the braid, gently tug on the outer loops until you reach the top, then do the other braid too.",
        "Skip this step if you made a 2-strand rope braid.",
        "Don't pull too hard, or the braid will come undone.",
        "Wrap the braids into buns and secure then with hair ties.",
        "Pick up the left braid, and wrap it around the the hair tie to create a bun.",
        "Tuck the end of the braid under the bun, then wrap another hair tie around the base of the bun.",
        "Repeat this step for the other braid.",
        "Do not twist the braids into a rope like you would with a standard bun.",
        "Touch up your hair as needed, then mist it with hairspray.",
        "If the buns feel loose, secure them along the side edges to the rest of your hair; use as many bobby pins as you need.",
        "Once you are happy with the way your space buns look, mist them with hairspray, then let the hairspray dry.",
        "If you did braided half-up buns, consider straightening the rest of your hair for a sleeker look."
