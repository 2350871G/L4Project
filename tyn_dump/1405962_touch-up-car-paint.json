Remove all the wax and sealant on the area and make sure any dirt and grime are gone as well. Without prepping the spot first, the paint won't adhere well, and it could look 'globby.'"

        "It\u2019s best to apply several thin coats instead of one thick coat.",
        "Follow the directions that came on your top-coat container.",
        "In some cases they will tell you to apply several coats and in others the directions will state that one coat is enough.",
        "Sand the area once more with 3000-grit sandpaper.",
        "Giving the surface one last sanding will ensure that the clear coat you applied is smooth and blended with the existing top coat.",
        "Sand it until the repaired area is flush with the rest of the paint surface on the car.",
        "Note: At this point the chipped area should disappear into the rest of the paint job.",
        "Polish and wax the entire car.",
        "Once you have repaired your paint chips it\u2019s nice to give your whole car a bit of care.",
        "Polishing and waxing the car will help the repaired area blend in with the rest of the paint job and it will protect the fixed area from more damage."
