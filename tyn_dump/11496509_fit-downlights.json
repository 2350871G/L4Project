        "Test the wires and outlets with a wire tester to make sure they don\u2019t have voltage running through them.",
        "If you don\u2019t know which circuits control the room where you\u2019re working, either contact an electrician to check your wiring or shut off the main power switch in your electrical box.Warning: Never work on wires while they\u2019re still live since you could seriously hurt or electrocute yourself.",
        "Run wires through your walls to the spot you\u2019re installing the light.",
        "You can either attach the lights to an existing switch or you can add a new switch on your circuit.",
        "Feed a 14/2 cable through the wall using a wire tape so it lines up with the area where you\u2019re placing the light.",
        "The 14/2 cable contains 1 hot wire, 1 neutral, and 1 ground.",
        "You can buy 14/2 wire from your local hardware store.",
        "If you don\u2019t feel comfortable wiring your home, call an electrician to do it for you.",
        "You can also install a downlight at an existing junction box if you have one.",
        "Just remove the existing lighting feature first.",
        "Strip the ends of the wires in your wall and on the downlight.",
        "Open the wire stripper and clamp the last \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the 14/2 cable between the jaws.",
        "Pull the strippers toward the end wire to remove the insulation.",
        "Repeat the process with the wire attached to the downlight.",
        "There will be 1 black wire, 1 white wire, and an uninsulated wire coming out of the 14/2 cable.",
        "The downlight will have 1 black or red wire, 1 white wire, and 1 uninsulated wire.",
        "Splice the matching wires with wire caps.",
        "Hold the 2 ends of the black wires together so they point straight up.",
        "Use a pair of pliers to twist the ends together so they form a good connection.",
        "Twist a wire cap clockwise onto the connection to cover the exposed ends.",
        "Repeat the process with the white and uninsulated wires.",
        "Some downlights will have connection boxes attached to them.",
        "If your downlight has a connection box, line up the wires from the 14/2 cable so they\u2019re directly across from the matching wires inside the box.",
        "Tighten the screws over the wires to secure them in place.",
        "Hold the spring clips against the sides of the light.",
        "The base of your downlight will have spring-loaded metal clips that snap open when they\u2019re released.",
        "Grab the spring clips from underneath and push them up so they lie flush with the base of the light.",
        "Keep holding them down so they don\u2019t snap open while you\u2019re trying to install the light.",
        "A surface-mounted downlight won\u2019t have spring clips.",
        "Instead, it will just push and snap into the mounting plate you attached earlier.",
        "Push the light into the hole until you hear the clips snap into place.",
        "Make sure all the wires go into the hole before your light does.",
        "Continue pushing the light straight into your ceiling so the clips go into the hole.",
        "Gently push the bottom of the light and listen for a clicking or snapping sound.",
        "Slowly lower the light back down to make sure the spring clips support it.",
        "Don\u2019t instantly let go of the downlight, or else it could fall out if the clips didn\u2019t engage correctly."
