For the recipe, you\u2019ll need 1 cup (225 g) of white rice, though you can adjust the amount based on how many people you\u2019re cooking for. In general, you should have \u00bd cup (112 \u00bd g) of uncooked rice per person. Add the rice to a colander or strainer so water can easily pass over it. Run cold water over the rice to rinse it.

You can skip the step if you\u2019re in a hurry, but you may wind up having to cook the rice a little longer on the stove. Cooking the Rice Drain off the soaking water and rinse the pan. When the rice is finished soaking, dump it back into the colander or sieve to get rid of the soaking water. Rinse out the pan quickly to remove any starchy residue, and return the rice to it. Add fresh water to the pan and stir the rice. A good ratio of rice to water is 1:1, which means you should add 1 cup (237 ml) of water to the pan with the rice.

Allow the water to come to a full boil, which should take 3 to 5 minutes. Mix the salt and butter into the rice. When the water is boiling, add some salt to taste and 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter to the pan. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully incorporated. This step is optional, but can lead to more flavorful rice. You can substitute oil, such as olive or canola, for the butter if you prefer. Reduce the heat and cover the pan. After you\u2019ve seasoned the rice, turn the heat  down to low. Place the lid on the pan to trap the steam inside so the rice cooks effectively. Allow the rice to cook until tender. With the rice covered, it should take 10 to 15 minutes for it to cook. When it\u2019s finished, it should still be slightly firm but not crunchy. Don\u2019t overcook the rice, though, or it will become gummy. If you didn\u2019t soak the rice before cooking it, it may take 18 minutes or more for it finish cooking. Finishing the Rice Turn off the heat and let the rice stand. When the rice is finished, turn off the stove or remove the pan from the burner. Leave the rice covered and allow it to stand for 5 to 10 minutes to finish the cooking process. If there\u2019s still water in the pan after the rice is finished cooking, drain it off. Uncover the rice and fluff it. After it\u2019s sat for about 5 minutes, take the lid off the pan. Use a fork or spoon to stir the rice a bit to help make it fluffy. It\u2019s a good idea to let the rice sit for another 2 to 3 minutes afterward to dry it slightly. Serve the rice while warm. When the rice is fluffy and has had time to dry a bit, you can divide it between plates or transfer it to a serving dish. Make sure to serve it quickly so it\u2019s still warm.
