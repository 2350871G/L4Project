Twist the thumbtack carefully once it\u2019s through the shell to slightly widen the hole to about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm). If you don\u2019t have a thumbtack, you can use any object that has a thin, pointed tip, like a needle or nail. Other Ways to Make a Hole in an Egg\nUse a hammer to carefully tap a very thin nail into the top of the egg. Buy an egg-piercing tool from a kitchenware store or an online retailer. Poke a hole with a small rotary tool or hand drill."

If you\u2019re having trouble getting the yolk to come out, try making the hole at the bottom a little bigger or shaking the egg to break up the yolk more. If you don't want to use your mouth on the egg, you can place the tip of a rubber ear syringe into the hole and squeeze the syringe to push out the yolk.

You can also set the eggs in an empty carton or on bamboo skewers to dry. Slide the skewers carefully through the 2 holes of each egg. To sanitize the eggs while you rinse them, use a little bit of dish soap or vinegar along with the water."

Place an egg into the mixture so that it\u2019s completely submerged, then let it soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Once it\u2019s the color that you want, take it out of the dye using a spoon or tongs and place it on a paper towel to dry. The longer you let the egg soak, the deeper the color will be. Get creative with your colors and designs. Try mixing different colors or making fun patterns, for example. Different Ways to Dye Your Blown-Out Eggs\nTo make stripes, wrap clear tape around the egg before you dye it. Anywhere that\u2019s covered in tape won\u2019t be dyed. You can do the same thing with circular stickers to make polka dots. For an ombre effect, use tongs to hold the egg so that just the bottom is in the dye. After 3 minutes, lower the egg further into the dye, about another \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) for another 3 minutes. Continue to make layers down the whole egg. If you want to add a glittery accent, add metallic temporary tattoos to the egg after the dye has dried. Carefully lay the tattoo onto the egg, then wipe a damp cloth over it before removing the paper backing. For cute egg faces, glue googly eyes onto the egg after you dye it and draw mouths or noses with a permanent marker."

You can also make a design with puff paint, then paint over it with acrylic paint once the puff paint has dried. This creates a cool raised effect underneath. To prevent the paint from smearing while it dries, slide a bamboo skewer through the holes. Stand the skewer upright or lay it over an empty container so the egg is suspended in the air."

Wrap 2 to 3 strips of the tape around an egg if you want to leave some of the shell showing, or cover the egg completely with tape for an all-over decoration. If you want an artsy mosaic look, cut out small pieces of washi tape and arrange them around the egg, leaving white space in between each piece.
