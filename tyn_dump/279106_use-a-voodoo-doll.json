As you begin sewing the fabric and picture together, fill the doll with stuffing."

To do this, place your hand over the object and direct your energy through it, focusing on making it new and pure. You can also wash your doll in salt water, cover it with purifying incense such as sage or sandalwood, allow natural light such as sunlight or moonlight to cleanse it, or bury it in the Earth and allow the universe and Mother Nature to transform the energy. There will likely be previous energy attached to any object you use in making your voodoo doll, so always remember to clear that object so that the energies don't become confused and muddled. To make the clearing process easier, use objects and supplies that have had little contact with others, unless you are specifically using that object to represent someone."
