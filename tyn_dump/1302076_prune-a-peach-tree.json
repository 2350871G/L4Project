Pruning your peach trees produces new growth, which in turn produces more fruit. Therefore, pruning yields a larger crop over time. Peach trees need to be open to sunlight, as shaded branches won\u2019t produce as much fruit. Pruning them opens up all branches to the sun. Removing dead parts of the tree is necessary so that new branches can come in. If you intend on spraying your tree with pesticides, pruning allows for an equal coverage over the entire plant."

Avoid pruning when the trees are blooming or shortly after blooming, because this can negatively affect the new growth. Prune your peach trees at planting or at the next spring (if done in the fall).
