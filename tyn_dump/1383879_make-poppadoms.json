Enjoy these tasty treats on their own, along with your favorite Indian meal, or even eat them like chips and dip them into a bit of chutney. Sun Baking Poppadoms Place the dough rounds on rimmed baking sheets. Take the dough you've made and prepare it for sun baking. Make sure the pieces are spaced far enough apart to give them room to expand a bit without touching each other. You'll need to use at least 2 baking sheets to do this. Put the sheets in direct sunlight until the rounds are completely dry, for 24-48 hours. To do this successfully, of course, you need to find a warm place with direct sunlight, with a temperature that should be ideally at least 80-85\u00baF (25-30\u00baC), if not much warmer.

        "Carefully watch over it as it fries.",
        "Of course, you can deep fry more than one poppadom at a time if you're getting really impatient, but this can lead to problems because they may fuse together, or you may lose track of one of them and lead it to burn a bit.",

        "Flip it over and cook it for about 30 seconds on the other side.",
        "Once it has cooked on one side, use a slotted spoon to flip it over so that it cooks on the other side.",
        "It won't need to cook for as long on the second side as on the first, though you should watch to make sure it is cooked evenly on both sides and cook it for a bit longer or for a bit less time on the second side if necessary.",
        "The finished product should be a nice rich golden brown color.",

        "The paper towel will absorb some of the extra oil.",
        "You can even flip the poppadom over after a minute or so, so that the oil from both sides is absorbed a bit.",
        "Deep fry the rest of the poppadoms.",
        "Now, continue to deep fry the poppadoms until they are all cooked to your liking.",
        "You may want to line multiple plates with paper towels so that more of their oil is absorbed.",

        "Sun Baking Poppadoms Place the dough rounds on rimmed baking sheets.",
        "Take the dough you've made and prepare it for sun baking.",
        "Make sure the pieces are spaced far enough apart to give them room to expand a bit without touching each other.",
        "You'll need to use at least 2 baking sheets to do this.",
        "Put the sheets in direct sunlight until the rounds are completely dry, for 24-48 hours.",
        "To do this successfully, of course, you need to find a warm place with direct sunlight, with a temperature that should be ideally at least 80-85\u00baF (25-30\u00baC), if not much warmer.",
        "The warmer it is, of course, the more quickly your poppadoms will bake.",

        "Serve.",
        "If you want to serve your poppadoms, either eat them right away or heat them up directly over an open flame or place them on a gas grill just until they're lightly toasted.",
        "You can also place them in your broiler, which should be set on high, until they're lightly toasted."
