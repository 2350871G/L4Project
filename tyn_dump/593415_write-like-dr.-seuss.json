Plus, made up words can often be funnier than real words, which helps kids stay engaged with the text. For a fun exercise, try making up a word starting with every letter of the alphabet. Arkity-ark, blooble, callywickle \u2013 don't worry about them sounding good, just let loose and write! Made up words also help children develop awareness of the sounds of different letters.

Two common forms of rhyme are internal rhyme, which uses rhyming words within the same sentence, and end rhyme, which rhymes words at the end of two sentences. Internal rhyme uses words that rhyme within the same sentence, such as \u201cThere is fun to be done\u201d from The Lorax. Try writing 10-20 sentences with internal rhyme: \u201cThere is glue in my shoe\u201d  or \u201cI'm in Heaven with Kevin,\u201d for example. End rhyme uses rhyming words at the end of sentences, such as \u201cWould you? Could you? In a car?\u201d Eat them! Eat them! Here they are,\u201d from Green Eggs and Ham. A great way to practice end rhyme is to write a few poems using potential characters from your story. Try using an ABCB rhyme structure, where the two B lines rhyme. For example: \u201cIt's in my hair / it's on my nose / but luckily / I have a hose.\u201d"

Part of what makes the line \u201cI do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am\u201d is the repetition of \u201cI do not like.\u201d\nPlay around with similar repetitive structures in your writing so that kids will want to repeat your lines again and again and again. Don't be afraid to use questions! Questions lend themselves well to repetition and rhyme. For example, \u201cA boat? A plane? A flying car? Not here, not there, not where you are!\u201d"
