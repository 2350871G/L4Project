        "Dry off after your bath with a clean, fluffy towel.",
        "Before you get into the bath, take a moment to pick out a clean towel from the cupboard and set it beside the tub.",
        "That way, you won\u2019t have to use an old, damp towel from your morning\u2019s shower.",
        "Consider having a special towel that only you use for your relaxing baths.",
        "This will keep the towel in great condition and it\u2019ll make your self-care time feel even more special.Tip: To keep your towels in a fluffier condition, use less detergent and dry them for less time than you would the rest of your laundry."
