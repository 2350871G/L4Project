        "Permanently Killing Ivy Leave it to dry in the sun.",
        "Ivy can still survive even when pulled from the ground, but will have a much harder time doing so on dry, rough terrain.",
        "Leave your pulled ivy out on a rocky area or concrete slab that gets full sunlight.",
        "It may take a few days, but you\u2019ll notice the plant begin to wilt and die as it absorbs the heat and loses nutrients being stuck on dry land.",
        "Suffocate the ivy.",
        "If you have enough supplies on hand, you can store the ivy in large plastic bags or garbage bags for several days or weeks.",
        "Instead of overdosing the ivy with too much sunlight, you\u2019ll starve the plant of light and remove it from its growth source.",
        "Keep the ivy/bags in a cool, dry area away from plantable ground or trees.",
        "Chip the ivy.",
        "If you happen to have a wood chipper on hand, you can put the ivy through the chipper to destroy it.",
        "This will kill it, but to be safe you should dispose of the chips away from your home and garden to prevent a possible reinfestation.",
        "If you don't have a chipper, you can lay the ivy out in a sunny location and pass over it a few times with a lawn mower.",
        "Leave the chopped-up vines to dry out in the sun."
