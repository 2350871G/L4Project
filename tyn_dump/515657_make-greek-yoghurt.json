When the milk cools down to a temperature of 108\u00b0 to 115\u00b0 F (42\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 C), transfer it into a glass or earthenware bowl. Do not use stainless steel. Allow to cool down until it's just warm. Why shouldn't you use stainless steel as a receptacle for the milk? Yogurt is made using bacteria cultures, which need very specific environments to survive and breed in. Using metal (stainless steel) can interfere with the bacteria culture."

If it has cooled down enough, whisk in 3 tablespoons of live yogurt or one yogurt starter package until completely incorporated. If you incorporate plain yogurt into your milk, make sure the yogurt you use contains a live culture. Check the label on the yogurt packet to make sure that \"live culture\" is written on there somewhere. (Some commercial yogurt products don't contain a live culture.) If using a yogurt starter packet (which contains the necessary bacteria culture), follow the manufacturer's directions about which proportions to use."

If you can, try to set the oven's temperature so that it stays at a steady 108\u00b0 F for the entire time. Why does the bacteria need heat to make yogurt out of milk? 108\u00b0 F is approximately the temperature at which the yogurt cultures begin consuming the lactose in the milk. This process is called fermentation, and it's the same process that produces beer from wheat or wine from grapes."

Next, place the cheesecloth or muslin cloth into the sieve, with a glass bowl placed underneath. Ladle the yogurt into the cloth and allow it to strain, until it achieves your desired consistency. As the draining process will take several hours, it's best to transfer it into the fridge. This process gets rid of all the excess water and makes your yoghurt thicker and much creamier. If you don't have muslin cloth or cheesecloth to strain the whey from the yogurt, use an old t-shirt that you aren't particularly tied to."

Here are some ideas you can tweak to make use of your leftover whey:\nFreeze it up in an ice cube tray and add it to your smoothies for added nutritional content.
