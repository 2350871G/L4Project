Make sure to coat both sides of the kidneys. A \u201cpinch\u201d of salt and pepper is generally how much seasoning you can pick up between your thumb and first finger. If using a shaker, just use 1 or 2 shakes. Mix the butter with the dry and wet ingredients. You will need 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of soft butter, \u20442  tsp (2.5 mL) each of cayenne pepper and mustard powder, and 1  tsp (4.9 mL) each of Worcestershire and anchovy sauce. Combine all these ingredients together in a small mixing bowl. You can also use 2 mashed or pureed anchovies in lieu of the anchovy sauce. Heat a small frying pan over medium heat and add the butter mixture. Let the butter melt in the pan for 1-2 minutes, rotating the pan periodically to coat the bottom. Taste-test the butter and adjust the seasonings to match your taste preferences. If the butter starts to brown, reduce the heat. Add the kidneys to the pan and cook for 2 1/2 minutes per side. As you pick up the kidneys to put them into the pan, give them a quick shake to disperse any excess flour. When your kidneys are finished, they should be seared on the outside and warm all the way through. If you want, use a meat thermometer to check that the internal temperature is in the 150 to 160 \u00b0F (66 to 71 \u00b0C) range. Avoid overcooking the kidneys as they will become tough to chew. Toast the bread while the kidneys are cooking. Use a toaster or another skillet on the stovetop. You can use regular sandwich bread, but something a little heartier would work best since you\u2019ll be loading the bread up with the kidneys and the sauce from the pan. A multi-grain bread or french loaf will toast well. Instead of toast, you could serve the deviled kidneys with white rice. Top the toast with the cooked kidneys and the butter sauce. You can eat the toast by hand, or place it on a plate and cut it with a fork and knife for a tidier eating experience. Kidneys are quick to cook and make a nice lunch or dinnertime meal. Garnish the toast with fresh parsley for a burst of green. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. To reheat them, simply put them into a skillet over medium heat for 5-6 minutes, or until they are heated through. Kidneys are best served fresh and right after they\u2019ve been cooked, so try to use leftovers quickly. Use a piece of masking tape on the airtight container to write the date you cooked the kidneys\u2014that way, you will remember how long they\u2019ll be good for.",
