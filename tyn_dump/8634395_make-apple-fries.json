Place a deep fry thermometer in the pan, and heat the oil on medium-high until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). You can substitute canola or peanut oil for the vegetable if you prefer. You can also use a candy thermometer to monitor the oil\u2019s temperature. Wash, core, and cut the apples. For the fries, you\u2019ll need 2 firm apples. Wash and core the apples to remove the seeds. Next, use a sharp knife to cut the apples into \u00bc-inch (6-mm) thick slices. You can peel the apples to remove the skin if you like, but it isn\u2019t necessary. Dredge the apples in the flour. Add 1 cup (128 g) of all-purpose flour to a small shallow dish. Place the apples slices in the flour and toss to coat both sides. If you prefer, you can substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. Fry the apples until golden brown in batches. Once the oil has reached the proper temperature, carefully drop the apples into the pan in batches. Allow the apples to cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side before flipping the fries and allowing them to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes on the other side, or until they are completely golden brown. Be careful when adding and flipping the apple fries. The oil will be extremely hot, so you can easily burn yourself. Drain the apple fries on paper towel. When the fries are finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to lift them out of the oil. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to help absorb some of the excess oil. Sprinkle the fries with ground cinnamon and powdered sugar. Once the apple fries have drained for a minute a two, transfer them to a platter. Dust the fries with ground cinnamon and powdered sugar to taste while still warm, and serve. You can eat the apple fries on their own, or serve them alongside ice cream, whipped cream, or caramel sauce for dipping. Preparing Battered Apple Fries Mix the milk, egg, flour, baking powder, some sugar, some cinnamon, and salt. Add \u00be cup (177 ml) of milk, an egg, 1 cup (128 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of baking powder, 2 tablespoons (24 g) of sugar, \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of cinnamon, and \u00bc teaspoon (1 g) of salt to a large bowl.

If you prefer, you can use approximately \u2153 of cup (70 g) of store-bought cinnamon sugar to dust over the finished apple fries. Heat the oil. Add vegetable oil to a large skillet until it reaches a depth of 1-inch (2.5-cm). Heat the oil over medium-high heat for 5 to 7 minutes. You can substitute peanut oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer. Cut the apple into wedges. For the fries, you\u2019ll need 3 large Granny Smith apples that have been cored and peeled. Use a sharp knife to cut the apples into \u00bd-inch (13-mm) thick wedges to form the fries. Fuji and Pink Lady apples also work well for the fries. Coat the apple fries in the batter. After you\u2019ve cut the apples into wedges, use a pair of tongs to carefully dip them into the batter. Allow the excess to drip back into the bowl, but make sure that the apples are completely coated. For the best results, dip the apple fries in the batter right before you add them to the oil. Fry the apple fries in batches until golden brown. Once the apple wedges are coated with the batter, use the tongs to drop them into the heated oil.

        "Warm up homemade or store-bought sauce to serve alongside the fries for dipping.",
        "Baking Healthy Apple Fries Preheat the oven and grease a baking sheet.",
        "To ensure that the oven is warm enough to bake the apple fries, set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) and allow the oven to fully preheat.",
        "Next, use a nonstick cooking spray to lightly grease a baking sheet.",
        "If you prefer, you can line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat instead of greasing it.",
        "Peel, core, and cut the apple.",
        "For the fries, you\u2019ll need 1 medium Fuji apple.",
        "Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin and then core it by using a sharp knife to cut the apple into quarters around the center stem.",
        "Next, use the knife to slice the apple into half moon slices that are approximately \u00bc-inch (6-mm) thick.",
        "You can also use a Gala apple for the fries.",
        "An apple corer makes it very easy to core an apple, so if you have one, you may want to use it instead of the knife.",

        "Blend the two ingredients together until they are well mixed.",
        "Toss the apple fries in the egg white mixture.",
        "After you\u2019ve mixed the egg whites with the maple extract, add the apple slices to the bowl.",
        "Mix the slices in the egg whites to ensure that they\u2019re well coated.",
        "Allow the excess egg white mixture to drip back into the bowl so clumps don\u2019t form when you roll the apple fries in the breadcrumbs.",
        "Dip the apple fries into the breadcrumb mixture.",
        "Once the apple fries are coated with the egg whites, add them to the bowl with the breadcrumb mixture.",

        "When the fries have baked for 10 minutes, use a spatula to flip them over.",
        "Place them back in the oven, and let them cook until they are browned and crispy on the outside, which should take about 10 minutes.",
        "While the apple fries should be brown and crispy on the outside, they should be tender on the inside.",
        "Serve the apple fries warm.",
        "When the apple fries are finished cooking, remove them from the oven.",
        "Transfer them to a plate and serve while they are still warm.",
