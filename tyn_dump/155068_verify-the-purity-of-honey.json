Any product sold in the European Union as honey must be free of additives by law, including antibiotics used to treat bees for disease. Any honey with defects seriously affecting the taste must be sold as \"baker's honey\" intended for use in processed foods. The United States government does not test for honey purity, and allows trace amounts of antibiotics. A USDA logo does not mean the honey is pure. Florida is the only U.S. state that requires honey to display all additives as long as it is both manufactured and sold within Florida.

Each of these produces different flavors, and even the honey of one beehive can vary from year to year as they collect nectar from different sources.
