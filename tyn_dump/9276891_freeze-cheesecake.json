    "text": " Freezing Whole Cheesecakes Let the entire cheesecake cool for 4 hours. Most cheesecake recipes have a final step that involves chilling it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and sometimes even longer. Make sure to let the cheesecake cool completely before freezing it. Freeze it uncovered for about 1 hour. Carefully place your cheesecake in the freezer as is. Keep it in there for about 1 hour and then take it out again. Move the cheesecake from its pan to cardboard. Get a durable piece of cardboard that\u2019s at least as big as the cheesecake lengthwise and widthwise. Wrap the piece of cardboard in aluminum foil. Loosen the edges of the cheesecake with a dull knife and then carefully lift it out of the pan it\u2019s in. Place the cheesecake directly on top of the cardboard. If you baked the cheesecake in a springform pan, carefully remove the sides of the pan before transporting the cheesecake. The best way to transport the cheesecake is with three spatulas and the help of a friend. Wrap the cheesecake in plastic wrap and foil. In order to protect your cheesecake from freezer burn, you\u2019ll need to keep it separated from the cold air. Wrap the entire cheesecake, including the cardboard it\u2019s on, with two layers of plastic wrap followed by one layer of aluminum foil. Label and date the cheesecake. Write the date and the type of cheesecake on the aluminum foil with a permanent marker. This way, you can keep track of how long your cheesecake is frozen. Keep it in the freezer for up to 1 month. Put the cheesecake back in the freezer. It may still be safe to eat after two or three months, but it\u2019ll taste best if eaten within one month.

If you thaw the cheesecake and you notice that it\u2019s dry, the crust is moist, and/or the edges of the cheesecake are brown or tan, it\u2019s most likely no longer safe to eat. Freezing Cheesecake Slices Chill the whole cheesecake. Cool the whole cheesecake in the refrigerator for as long as your recipe instructs, or for a minimum of 4 hours. It\u2019s important that the cheesecake is completely chilled before being frozen. Put the uncovered cheesecake in the freezer for 1 hour. Freeze the whole cheesecake in a safe spot in the freezer where it won\u2019t get damaged. Take it out after one hour. If your cheesecake is already sliced, put all of the uncovered slices in the freezer for an hour. Dip a knife in hot water and slice the cheesecake. Fill a tall drinking glass with hot water and put a thin steel knife in the glass. Take the knife out and cut the cheesecake in half. Dip the knife back in the water before cutting it into fourths. Continue this until you have eight slices. Dipping a knife in hot water before and between slicing will make cutting easier and smoother. Wrap each slice in foil and put it in a freezer bag. Place one piece of cheesecake on a sheet of aluminum foil. Wrap it completely in the sheet of foil, put it in a freezer-safe plastic bag, and seal the bag. Repeat this process for every cheesecake slice. Label and date each bag. Write the date and the type of cheesecake on every plastic bag with permanent marker. This will help you remember how long your slices have been frozen. Freeze the slices for up to one month. Return your slices to the freezer and keep them frozen for a maximum of one month to ensure optimum tastiness. Put the slices somewhere in your freezer where things won\u2019t be placed on top of them so that they don\u2019t get damaged. Thawing and Serving the Cheesecake Move whole cheesecakes to the refrigerator overnight. When you\u2019re ready to eat your cheesecake, move it from the freezer to the refrigerator. Keep it there overnight to prevent condensation and to keep the cheesecake\u2019s structure intact. Let a whole cheesecake sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. After it has thawed in the refrigerator overnight, place the cheesecake on your kitchen counter for half an hour before serving it. Ideally, the cheesecake should be kept at room temperature, or 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), during this time. Put a slice in the microwave for 45-60 seconds on defrost. If you separated your cheesecake into slices, take a slice out of its bag and remove its foil. Put it on a plate and heat it in the microwave for 45-60 seconds. Make or thaw any toppings and put them on the cheesecake. Prepare any toppings or decorations, such as strawberries and whipped cream or chocolate sauce and chopped nuts, and put them on the cheesecake. Serve and enjoy! Do not freeze cheesecake with the toppings already on it. Keep them separate until just before serving and eating.",
