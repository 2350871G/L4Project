If you\u2019re painting your first tray ceiling, or you just like a classic look, don\u2019t paint your crown molding.

Another less intense option is to just paint everything in the room white, including the walls, the ceiling, and all of the crown molding.

If you\u2019d like a more interesting, contemporary feel but you don\u2019t want to go too bold, use 2 similar paint shades instead of just 1. This can provide a unique look that still ties everything in the room together. For example, paint the inset of your tray ceiling a few shades darker or lighter than the walls of the room or the rest of the ceiling. Enhance the architecture subtlety by painting everything 1 color. If your style is somewhat bold and unique, paint everything, including the walls, the ceiling, and the molding, the same color. This gives off a monochromatic vibe. Tie everything together by picking a color that matches some of the larger furniture pieces and/or accessories in the room.

This is an even more striking style choice if the tray inset has a unique shape. Heighten the room by matching the room walls to the tray walls. The tray walls are the outside edges of the ceiling that don\u2019t make up the tray inset or the crown molding around it.
