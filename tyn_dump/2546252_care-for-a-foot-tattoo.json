Of course, that time varies and you should do as you were instructed by your tattoo artist. When you finally do remove your bandage, make sure to take it off with care. If your bandage is so tight that it sticks to your tattoo, then you should use running water to loosen the covering. Let the water drip gently upon the bandage until you feel the adhesive lose its grip. Once it is loose, gently take the bandage off."

If you pick at them, then you risk the chance of getting an infection. This is dangerous and can also ruin the tattoo's design. You might accidentally knock off one of your scabs. If it was just a small scab, you shouldn't worry too much because you probably haven't lost a lot of ink. If it's a bigger scab, then you might have to get it retouched in time."
