Toss everything together until the ingredients are completely combined.If you want extra flavor, you can toss in chopped sage or parsley. Place the dressing in a greased 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) pan. Apply a thin coat of butter, shortening, or non-stick spray to the bottom of your pan. Then spread out the dressing so it fills the entire pan in an even layer.If you\u2019re using a non-stick pan, you don\u2019t need to grease it beforehand. To make cleanup easier, you can line the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil before putting the dressing in. If you do this, you also don\u2019t need to grease the pan. Set the pan in the oven and bake it for 45 minutes before removing it. To help the dressing cook evenly, place the pan on the middle rack of the oven, where the hot air can circulate around the entire dish. After 45 minutes, the dressing should be golden brown and slightly crisp on the top. Take it out of the oven.If you aren\u2019t using the dressing for the turducken right away, transfer it to an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3 to 4 days. Using the Turducken Drippings to Make Gravy Heat the turducken drippings, butter, and flour in a saucepan. Pour the drippings from the bottom of the roasting pan into the saucepan. Then add 1 tablespoon (14.2 g) of butter and 1 tablespoon (8 g) of flour and turn the stove to medium heat. Stir the mixture constantly, making sure all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.If you're having trouble blending the flour into the liquid, use a whisk instead of a spoon to break up large chunks. For a smoother gravy, strain the turducken drippings before you add them. Place a colander over the top of the pan and pour the drippings through it to catch any large bits. Stir in the whole milk and chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil. Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of whole milk and \u20442 cup (120 ml) of chicken stock into the saucepan, continuing to whisk the liquids together as you do so. Turn the heat on the stove up to high until the contents of the pan begin to boil.It may help to pour the liquids in gradually while you stir to make it easier to blend them. You can also substitute 1%, 2%, or skim milk for the whole milk. However, it will make your gravy thinner. Reduce the heat and let the gravy simmer for 10 minutes. Once your mixture begins boiling, turn the heat down to low or medium-low. Allow the gravy to simmer so that it thickens up to the right consistency, stirring it occasionally to prevent it from burning on the bottom of the pan.If you prefer a thinner gravy, you can add more chicken stock after the 10 minutes are up. If you want a thicker gravy, whisk in a little more flour. Use a kitchen timer or the clock app on your phone to monitor the time. Add salt and pepper to taste if you'd like. Remove the pan from the heat and let the gravy cool slightly. Before serving, allow the gravy to cool off for about 5 minutes. Take it off of the stove while it cools so the gravy at the bottom of the pan doesn't scorch.If you aren't using the gravy immediately, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",
