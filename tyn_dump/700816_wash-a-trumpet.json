Place them somewhere safe where they won\u2019t get lost or knocked over by kids or pets. Be sure to keep them in their proper order so that you won\u2019t have a hard time reassembling them later.

Use one hand to tug the mouthpiece away from the trumpet while you stabilize the body of the horn with your other hand. At this point, your trumpet should be fully disassembled, and ready to be cleaned. Cleaning the Trumpet Body and Slides Fill a bathtub or a large basin with warm water and soap. The water should be moderately warm, but not scalding. Be sure to fill the tub with enough water to fully immerse the body of your trumpet. Mix a few drops of mild dish soap into the tub. Lay a towel on the bottom of the tub to protect your trumpet from scratching. Place the slides and the main body into the bathtub to soak. Your slides should remain in the tub for about 1 minute, while the body can soak for up to 5-10 minutes. Clean the slides and tubing of your trumpet. Use a cleaning snake or brass saver to clear debris from the insides of the tubing. Run the snake gently through the insides of your slides and tubing once they're finished soaking in the tub. Be careful not to force the snake into any tight areas in the tubing, as this might damage their interior. Clean the body of the trumpet.

Dry one piece at a time, and use caution with the washcloth to avoid damaging any part of your instruments.

When you're finished drying the exterior of these parts with the washcloth, allow their insides to dry by placing them on a thick towel on a dry surface or countertop. Place the slides near the places where they will eventually be reinserted into the trumpet to avoid mixing them up later on. Cleaning the Valves and Mouthpiece Wash the bottoms of your valves. Clean the bottom section of your valves with warm running water and a small amount of dish soap. Place the bottom bottom side of the valves beneath the running water, and then apply soap with your fingers or a damp washcloth. Focus on cleaning out the small holes underneath the valves that line up with the slides rather than cleaning the entire valve. Rinse all soapy water from the valve holes. Keep the top parts of your valves away from the water. When cleaning trumpet valves, it's important to keep the tops dry.

Reassembling and Polishing the Trumpet Oil and reinsert your slides into the trumpet. Put a small dab of slide grease on the side of each slide and rub the grease evenly into the brass with your fingertips. Reinsert the slides into the trumpet, and use a tissue or washcloth to wipe off any excess oil. Oil your valves before reinserting them into your trumpet. Apply several drops of oil to the base of each valve, and place the valves back inside their proper casings on the body of the trumpet. Gently press the valves up and down once they are reinserted to make sure they are properly oiled. Polish your trumpet with a polishing cloth.
