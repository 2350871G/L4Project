Cut your fabric into 2 larger sized pieces, such as 5 by 5 in (13 by 13 cm) squares. Stack and pin the fabric squares with the right (print) sides facing in. Place the fabric squares so that the right sides are facing each other and the wrong sides are facing outwards. Line up the edges of the 2 fabric pieces on all sides. Then, insert 2 pins through the center of the squares to keep them in place. Insert the pins so that they are parallel to each other and about 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the center of the square. Sew 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the edges of the square leaving a 1 in (2.5 cm) opening. Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting and place the edge of the fabric square under the presser foot. Apply gentle pressure to begin sewing along the edge of the square. Sew until you are about 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the beginning of your stitches, and then stop sewing. Make sure to avoid the pins as you sew! Do not sew over them or you may damage your machine or the pins. Invert the fabric square and push the stuffing in through the opening. Use your fingers and the back end of a pencil to turn the square right side out. Then, grab a handful of stuffing and begin pushing it in through the opening you left in the square.

Creating a Flower Petal Pincushion Trace 2 equal-sized circles onto your fabric and cut them out. Use the lid of a jar, the outside of a bowl, or another round object as your guide. Trace the circles onto the fabric using a ballpoint pen or pencil. Then, cut along the lines using a pair of sharp fabric scissors. You can make the circles as big or small as you like. Avoid using a marker or fountain pen to trace the circles as these may bleed onto the fabric.Tip: The bigger the object you choose, the bigger you pin cushion will be! Choose a round object that is about the same size that you want your pin cushion to be. Sew a straight stitch around the circles except for a 1 in (2.5 cm) opening. Place the fabric circles together so that their right (print or front) sides are facing each other. Then, sew a straight stitch around the outside of the circle about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the raw edges. Stop about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the opening. Cut around the outside of the circle with pinking shears. Cut off the excess threads at the beginning and end of the seam. Then, use pinking shears to trim around the outside of the fabric.

Bring the needle up through 1 of the buttonholes and then back down through another buttonhole. After you create the last segment, bring the needle back up through the center 1 more time. Insert the needle through 1 of the holes in your button and then back down through the second hole in the button. Push the needle through the center of the cushion and back out the other side. Repeat this 1 more time to secure the button. Then, tie a knot at the end of the thread and cut the excess to secure it. Making a Mason Jar Pincushion and Sewing Kit Lay out a piece of cotton fabric and cut around the outside of the mason jar lid. Place the mason jar lid onto the wrong (back) side of the fabric. Use a pair of sharp fabric scissors to cut a circle about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the outside of the jar lid. Don\u2019t worry if it looks like there is too much fabric or if the circle is not perfect! You can trim it down more and clean up the edges if needed. Trace 2 circles 0.25 in (0.64 cm) smaller than the mason jar lid onto a piece of felt. Use a circular object that is about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) smaller than the mason jar lid as your guide. Then, use a marker to trace around the outer edges of the circle. Cut out the circles using a pair of sharp fabric scissors. Avoid any jagged or crooked edges along the outside of the circle. Make a sandwich of stuffing, 1 felt circle, and the jar lid. Place a handful of stuffing onto the center of your fabric circle. Then, top the stuffing with 1 of the felt circles. And then place the lid on top of the felt with the bottom of the lid facing up. Add hot glue around the outer edges of the lid to secure the fabric.
