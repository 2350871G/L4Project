If adding more of a particular frequency makes the music sound worse, turn that frequency down until the music sounds lacking in that frequency range. If adding more of a particular frequency improves the sound of the music leave it flat (neither boosted nor attenuated) for now. Be careful when boosting high-midrange and high end frequencies, as they can be piercing if boosted too loud (it is not necessary to boost any frequency all the way up, just up enough that you can hear the difference)."

It may take you a while to get the hang of it, but the more you do it the better you will get. All that the fancy computer software for PA tuning does is play noise through the system, the frequencies and proportions thereof are already known, and then analyses the sound coming back and measures the difference between the sound it sends out and the sound it gets back. This is basically all that we're doing here, except a little bit less precise and with more room for personal taste."
