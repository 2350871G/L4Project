The hard part is dealing with the unique characteristics of the special fabrics you are using..\nPay close attention to the fabric recommendations on the pattern envelope. Some fabrics will work much better than others for a particular project and the pattern envelope will state this for you. Take care with your material. Most prom dress materials (satin, lace, silk, velvet) are dry-clean only and have other special care instructions (cool iron only, etc). Some also have the annoying characteristic of being slippery to handle (need a lot of pins), fibers \"catch\" and pull when sewing (your machine may need a new, sharp, needle), or they fray easily (tape or iron interfacing along all raw edges before assembling the garment). These difficult to manage characteristics are why we like the look and feel of the material, as well as why dresses made from these materials are so expensive and difficult to make! Purchase the recommended yardage plus half a yard. Patterns usually allow plenty of yardage, but it's always nice to have a little extra \"just in case\" you cut a piece wrong the first time. If you do everything correctly, you can always use the extra fabric to make a matching purse, scarf, or similar item."
