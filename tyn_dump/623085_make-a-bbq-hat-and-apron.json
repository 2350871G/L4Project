    "text": " Apron Lay out the cloth you will be using for the apron, iron out any creases, and lay the apron pattern over the cloth.  Trace around the pattern with tailor's chalk, and cut the pattern out.  Flip the material over so that the \"wrong\" side faces up. Fold over a quarter-inch hem (fold twice if you'd like) and sew it down. Do the same along all of the inside edges; the top, sides, chest area, and bottom. Make sure to press each hem after you're finished sewing it. Take out more fabric for the neck strap and cut out the piece.  Fold the piece over and press it with the iron.  Then, unfold it, and fold those sides in half so that they meet in the crease, and press those sides with the iron.  Fold in the end pieces and press with the iron.  Clip the corners of the strap at an angle. Fold the strap in on itself and press it with the iron. Sew the strap along all three open ends. Attach the strap to the inside of the apron piece. Sew the strap on using a square formation pattern. Create the apron ties the same way you created the neck strap, just make them a little longer and not quite as wide.  Attach them in the same manner that the neck strap was attached, on the corner of the chest area and sides of the apron. The apron is finished! Chef Hat Cut out the top piece of the chef hat from the pattern using the tailor chalk and scissors or another cutting device.  Stitch all the way around the edge of the pattern using the longest stitch length, locking the stitch at the beginning, but not at the end.  Cut out the hat band cloth from the pattern using the tailor chalk and scissors or another cutting device. Make sure you measure your own head (or whoever will be wearing the hat) to determine the size of the hat necessary. Adjust the hat band according to size. Fold the cloth in half \"wrong\" sides together and press with the iron.  Fold and press an inch seam allowance down both sides.  Fold the band \"right\" sides together and sew a seam down the side.  Press the seam open with the iron and fold the band together \"right\" sides out.  Grab the circle pattern with the loose stitching and pull the stitch (make sure it's fairly even throughout) until it's about the same size as the band you created.  Carefully press the bottom edge of the circle against the open end of the band and pin.  Do this all the way around the open seams and sew the two pieces together. Be sure to catch the other side of the band as you sew. Now you're totally done! Finished. ",
