Whatever you are, no matter how embarrassing you think it is, you can make it work. Read some fashion magazines. Stores like Hollister, Abercrombie, Aeropostale, American Eagle, Wet Seal, Forever 21, and H&M are really in style, although beware of looking like an advertisement. But don't think it has to be limited to those stores. Kohls, JCPenney's, Target, and even Walmart can have some cute clothing and shoes.If you are a little younger, try maybe Justice and even Sears!"
