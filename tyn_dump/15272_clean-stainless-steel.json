Pans should be washed by hand, because dishwashers can work away at the handles of your pans. Use a towel or rag to immediately dry your pan. This immediate drying helps prevent water spots. If water spots do form, rinse them in club soda (reused from pan to pan) and dry with a soft rag or cloth."

If your pan only has burn marks, you can sprinkle baking soda onto the burnt areas and scrub them away with a soft sponge. The baking soda will help dissolve the burn marks. You can add the baking soda to a dry pan, or mix it with a small amount of water to make a baking soda paste. After you have removed the burn marks, rinse the pan with clean water and dry it with a clean cloth. For really tough burn marks, but you can use a slightly abrasive sponge to scrub and lift away the burned areas."
