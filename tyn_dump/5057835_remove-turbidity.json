A home testing kit is usually sufficient. If you do not have a home testing kit or if you suspect that the results might be inaccurate, take a sample of the water to a local pool store for professional testing. Chlorine levels should be between 1.0 and 3.0 ppm, and pH levels should be between 7.2 and 7.4. Cyanuric acid levels should be at about 40 ppm.

Low chlorine levels are among the most common causes of turbidity in pool water. The sunlight can damage chlorine and make it less effective. When this happens, bacteria can build up in the water, causing it to become cloudy. If you tested the water and the chlorine levels are only slightly lower than usual, you can correct them by adding the amount of chlorine called for on the label instructions.

Lower the cyanuric acid levels by draining 20 percent of the water and refilling the pool with fresh water. Too little cyanuric acid can make it easier for the sun to break down the chlorine in your pool, creating water that is less resistant to dirt and bacteria.

Beneficial bacteria also helps to establish a bacteria colony in your filter. When a colony grows in your filter, it attracts and draws bacteria out of the tank itself, clearing up the water.

Cured hay can be used to remove clay turbidity. For best results, use alfalfa, red clover, bermuda, or other legume hay. Pull apart the bales of hay and evenly scatter the pieces in the shallow water around the edge of the pond. As the hay decomposes, it produces organic acids and positive ions that can neutralize the negative clay ions. Hay stimulates helpful bacteria growth. Do not apply the hay too often, however, since it can deplete the oxygen in the water and kill some of the fish living there. For that reason, it is also best to use hay in ponds that have low levels of natural organic materials."

If this initial dose does not clear the water within four weeks, apply a second dose of 125 lb (56.25 kg) per acre foot. Gypsum is also used to clear clay turbidity. It attracts clay particles, binding them and preventing them from settling. Use a small shovel to evenly spread the gypsum over the pond. Gypsum is chemically known as calcium sulfate. As a calcium compound, this treatment is generally not effective if you have hard water, which already contains large amounts of calcium."

When livestock approaches the pond, debris from the shoreline can get into the water and cause cloudiness. If you need the livestock to be able to drink to water, you should siphon the water into a separate tank. You could also fence off all but a small corner of the pond, which should limit the access and debris getting stirred to one spot while still allowing the animals access to the water source."

Possible sources of trouble include crayfish, aquatic insects, common carp, an bullhead catfish. You can control crayfish and insects by introducing predator species to the water. Some options include the largemouth bass and channel catfish. Large numbers of catfish or other bottom feeding fish can be controlled by fishing some out with dough balls or other baits. You can also control populations of catfish by introducing competing fish species, like largemouth bass and bluegill."

To minimize watershed run-off, keep a vegetated ground cover around the perimeter of the pond, extending at least 100 feet (30.5 m) around. Sod grass is usually a good choice. Reduce wind run-off by spreading crushed rock along the shorelines receiving the largest, strongest gusts of wind. You can also plant trees or shrubs around the pond to block the wind, concentrating on the upwind side of the pond. Plant aquatic vegetation on the downwind side to reduce wave erosion. Never plant trees on a dam, however, since the roots can damage the structure. If there is a stream leading into the pond, install sediment traps further upstream to catch additional run-off."

        "When a colony grows in your filter, it attracts and draws bacteria out of the tank itself, clearing up the water.",
        "The gravel must come from an established tank with health fish.",
        "You can usually purchase some from a store that sells fish if you do not know anyone who can give you some for free.",
        "Check the filter.",
        "The aquarium must have a power filter, and that filter must be clean and working properly.",
        "Feel the outside of the filter.",
        "If it seems abnormally warm, it might be clogged or damaged.",
        "Check the instructions for your particular filter model to determine the proper way to clean it.",
        "Method Three: Ponds Add cured hay.",
        "Spread two square bales of hay per surface acre every two weeks throughout the spring and supper.",
        "Do not apply more than four times per year.",
        "Cured hay can be used to remove clay turbidity.",
        "For best results, use alfalfa, red clover, bermuda, or other legume hay.",
        "Pull apart the bales of hay and evenly scatter the pieces in the shallow water around the edge of the pond.",
        "As the hay decomposes, it produces organic acids and positive ions that can neutralize the negative clay ions.",
        "Hay stimulates helpful bacteria growth.",
        "Do not apply the hay too often, however, since it can deplete the oxygen in the water and kill some of the fish living there.",
        "For that reason, it is also best to use hay in ponds that have low levels of natural organic materials.",
        "Use gypsum.",
        "Apply 500 lb (225 kg) per acre foot of water.",
        "If this initial dose does not clear the water within four weeks, apply a second dose of 125 lb (56.25 kg) per acre foot.",
        "Gypsum is also used to clear clay turbidity.",
        "It attracts clay particles, binding them and preventing them from settling.",
        "Use a small shovel to evenly spread the gypsum over the pond.",
        "Gypsum is chemically known as calcium sulfate.",
        "As a calcium compound, this treatment is generally not effective if you have hard water, which already contains large amounts of calcium.",
        "Keep livestock animals out.",
        "Grazing livestock can easily cause turbidity, but you can solve the problem by building a fence around the pond to keep the animals out.",
        "When livestock approaches the pond, debris from the shoreline can get into the water and cause cloudiness.",
        "If you need the livestock to be able to drink to water, you should siphon the water into a separate tank.",
        "You could also fence off all but a small corner of the pond, which should limit the access and debris getting stirred to one spot while still allowing the animals access to the water source.",
        "Balance the pond ecosystem.",
        "Bottom feeding aquatic animals and marine life that burrows into the sediment can stir debris and cause excessively cloudy water when left unchecked.",
        "Possible sources of trouble include crayfish, aquatic insects, common carp, an bullhead catfish.",
        "You can control crayfish and insects by introducing predator species to the water.",
        "Some options include the largemouth bass and channel catfish.",
        "Large numbers of catfish or other bottom feeding fish can be controlled by fishing some out with dough balls or other baits.",
        "You can also control populations of catfish by introducing competing fish species, like largemouth bass and bluegill.",
        "Protect the pond from run-off.",
        "Wind, waves, soil erosion, and watershed sources can all cause debris run-off in your pond, and that run-off will create turbid water.",
        "To minimize watershed run-off, keep a vegetated ground cover around the perimeter of the pond, extending at least 100 feet (30.5 m) around.",
        "Sod grass is usually a good choice.",
        "Reduce wind run-off by spreading crushed rock along the shorelines receiving the largest, strongest gusts of wind.",
        "You can also plant trees or shrubs around the pond to block the wind, concentrating on the upwind side of the pond.",
        "Plant aquatic vegetation on the downwind side to reduce wave erosion.",
        "Never plant trees on a dam, however, since the roots can damage the structure.",
        "If there is a stream leading into the pond, install sediment traps further upstream to catch additional run-off."
