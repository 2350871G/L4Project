        "Don\u2019t worry if your circle isn\u2019t a perfect spiral.",
        "The crystal will cover it so it won\u2019t be visible.",
        "Try to leave about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of wire at the ends after you\u2019ve twisted the circle.Tip: If the circle is raised, lightly tap it with a hammer to flatten it out.",
        "Remove the ring from the mandrel.",
        "Slide the ring off of the mandrel once you've wrapped the circle at the top.",
        "Be careful not to squish or bend the band of the ring while removing it.",
        "If the ring doesn't slide off easily, gently wiggle it back and forth as you pull it up the mandrel to loosen it.",
        "Tuck the ends of the wire near the circle base around the band of the ring.",
        "Take each of the loose ends at the center and wrap them 1 to 2 times around the band to prevent the circle base from unraveling.",
        "Wind them tightly as close to the band as possible.",
        "Use the needle-nose pliers to help get the wire around the band if necessary.",
        "Place the crystal on top of the circle base.",
        "Set the crystal in the position that you want it to be on the ring.",
        "For example, if you have a long piece of quartz, decide if you want it to lay so that it goes down the length of your finger or across the width of your finger.",
        "Align the crystal so that it completely covers the wire circle underneath unless you want the base to show.Tip: For a ring that's both fashionable and functional, choose a crystal that's no wider than the width of your finger and no longer than the bottom half of your finger.",
        "Stones that are this size or smaller are easier to wear and don't look too overpowering.",
        "Wrap both ends of the wire tightly around the crystal.",
        "Take each loose end of the wire, starting at the center, and wind it tautly around the middle of the crystal once you have it positioned properly.",
        "Continue wrapping until you have about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of wire left at each end.",
        "If the crystal moves or slips while you\u2019re wrapping it, you can put a dab of craft glue on the base beneath it to hold it in place.",
        "You can just wrap the wire around the center of the crystal, add a design like a criss-cross, or twist the wire in different directions around the stone.",
        "Wind the ends of the wire around the band of the ring.",
        "After securing the crystal onto the base, take the remaining wire at each end and wind it tightly around the band.",
        "This prevents the wire from coming undone around the crystal.",
        "Make it as taut as possible.",
        "If there\u2019s any extra wire, snip it off with the wire cutters.",
        "You can use needle-nose pliers to help wrap the wire if you\u2019re having trouble doing it with your fingers.",
        "Size up the ring by placing it back on the mandrel and hammering the band.",
        "Because you originally made the ring a smaller size, you may need to enlarge it slightly to fit your finger.",
        "To do this, slide the band onto the mandrel.",
        "Then take a hammer and lightly tap the top side of the band to loosen the metal.",
        "As it becomes pliable, slide the ring down the mandrel until it's at the correct size groove.",
        "For instance, if you wear a size 8 but made your ring a size 7, hammer the band until it reaches the size 8 groove.",
        "Alternate hammering the band and sliding it down the mandrel."
