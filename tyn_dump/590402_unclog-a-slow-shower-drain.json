Most drains are either drop stoppers or push/lock drain stoppers. To release a drop stopper, first lift it up slightly. It should have screw that sticks up a little. Simply turn the screw a bit to make it looser, then lift the stopper up. For the push/lock drain stopper, first push down once like you are going to stop up the drain. Push it again to unlock it. Once it is unlocked, you should be able to unscrew the whole stopper and then pull it out. In a shower, you may need to just lift up the strainer at the bottom. You may also need to unscrew the grating."

        "Boil some water, and then slowly pour it down the drain, which will help move some minor blockages along.",
        "If you have regular PVC pipes, boiling water could damage the pipes.",
        "However, if you have metal or CPVC pipes (which can take higher temperatures), using boiling water should be fine.",
        "However, according to most city codes, you should have metal or CVPC, not PVC.",
        "Try vinegar, baking soda, and hot water.",
        "Another option for a natural solution is vinegar, baking soda, and hot water.",
        "These ingredients can help break up the clog when used in conjunction with each other, though you may not want to mix these solutions with chemical clog cleaners.",
        "Start by pouring a single cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by 2 cups of boiling water.",
        "Once you've given that about five minutes, follow it up with a baking soda-vinegar combo.",
        "Pour a cup of baking soda down the drain.",
        "With the stopper ready to go in, pour in a cup of vinegar.",
        "Stop up the drain, and let the baking soda and vinegar foam together.",
        "Once it's done, pour another cup of boiling water down the drain.",
        "Once again, make sure you have CPVC or metal pipes, as boiling water may damage regular PVC pipes.",
        "Nonetheless, most houses built to code should have pipes that can withstand boiling water.",
        "Help unclog the drain with a toilet plunger.",
        "Tape over any overflow holes with duct tape, so you can get a better seal.",
        "Put water into the tub to cover the bottom of the plunger.",
        "If there is already standing water that is draining slowly, you can use that instead of adding more water.",
        "Place the plunger over the drain and plunge the drain a few times, moving it up and down, much like you would in the toilet.",
        "You may want to get a plunger specifically for this purpose so it will be cleaner.",
        "However, since you'll likely be cleaning out your shower when you're done, putting a dirty plunger in there won't be the end of the world.",
        "Using Physical Objects to Unclog the Drain Try a drain stick first.",
        "A drain stick, such as a Zip-it, is a mini snake that can be used to remove clogs.",
        "Once you have the stopper removed, you stick the end of the stick down the drain.",
        "The barbs catch on any clogs, and you can pull them out.",
        "However, the stick is only about a foot long, so it won't work on clogs further down.",
        "Buy or rent a snake.",
        "A snake, also known as an auger cable or sewer rod, is used to find clogs further down.",
        "It's a cable that has a tip on the end to pick up clogs.",
        "You can buy or rent one at your local home improvement store to use on your drain.",
        "Push the cable in.",
        "On a shower, remove the strainer part.",
        "On a tub drain, take off the overflow plate and go through that hole.",
        "Start threading the cable or rod into the hole.",
        "Keep going until you feel the line hit a clog, then stop pushing.",
        "Latch on to the clog.",
        "With an auger cable, latch on to it by turning the handle clockwise.",
        "That twists the end into the clog.",
        "Keep pushing, pulling, and turning to get rid of the clog.",
        "With a sewer rod, push forward and back to break up the clog.",
        "Make sure it is clear.",
        "If the standing water starts draining, that's a good sign the line is starting to clear.",
        "Keep working at the clog until it feels completely gone, and run some more water down it to make sure that it is draining properly and that there's not a clog further down the line.",
        "If there's a clog further down the line, you may need to feed in more rod or cable to clear that clog out.",
        "Pull out the rod or cable.",
        "Once you're sure the line is clear, wind the rod or cable out of the pipe.",
        "Run some hot water down the pipe to ensure you are completely clear, and then replace anything that needs replacing, including the shower drain.",
        "Wind up the pipe and return it to the store or put it away.",
        "Avoiding Clogging Your Drain Take measures to prevent buildup in drains.",
        "Use strainers to minimize the chance of hair entering the drain.",
        "These strainers just fit over the drain and catch hair before it goes down to where you can't get it as easily.",
        "You can purchase strainers from a hardware store near you.",
        "However, you do need to clean out these strainers regularly to keep your shower draining properly.",
        "Flush your drain with hot water.",
        "Run hot water down your drain every time you use the shower or bath.",
        "This process will allow fresh build-up to be washed away, reducing the chances of prolonged buildup sticking to your pipes.",
        "Use baking soda regularly.",
        "You can also use a baking soda flush once or month or so.",
        "Simply start by dumping a cup of baking soda down your drain.",
        "Follow that with a cup of boiling water.",
        "Doing so can help keep clogs from building up."
