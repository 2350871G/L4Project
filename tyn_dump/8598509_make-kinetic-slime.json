        "The slime will be very thick and stiff.",
        "You can shape it with your fingers or cookie cutters.",
        "Store the sand in a lidded container.",
        "A plastic box or jar with a tight-fitting lid will work the best.",
        "You can also try using a plastic, zippered baggie instead.",
        "Like other types of slime, this slime will eventually dry out.",
