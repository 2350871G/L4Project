Remember that even the sturdiest latch is useless if you don't actually secure it in place! Make sure you latch the door every time you close it. Some people stick a binder clip over the door and frame wires to add an additional latching mechanism. Pick out a cage with a solid, comfortable floor.

Running around keeps ferrets occupied and gives them needed exercise. If you have 2 or more ferrets, look for a cage with at least 4 levels. The elevated platforms should have solid flooring as well. Choosing a Location for the Cage Put the cage in a semi-active location in your house. Ferrets like attention when they\u2019re awake, so don\u2019t tuck the cage away in a back room where nobody goes. However, they also sleep a lot, so don\u2019t place it in a very loud or hectic area. A den or home office might make a good spot, for instance. Ensure lots of fresh air ventilation in the cage spot. Most indoor locations with a functioning air conditioning or heating system should suffice. Depending on the outside weather, you can also crack open a nearby window. The more fresh air ventilation the location gets, the better. Don\u2019t stick the cage in a small room with the door closed. Make sure the location remains between 50 and 75 \u00b0F (10 and 24 \u00b0C). Ferrets are sensitive to temperatures that are too hot or cold, so maintain a consistent temperature range in the cage location.

If your ferret has been in the sun and seems lethargic or ill, it may be suffering from heat stroke. Call your vet right away. Accessorizing the Cage Choose a spot in the cage for a sturdy food dish. Identify a spot on any of the levels to serve as the feeding area. Ferrets like to push and lift their food dishes (which leads to spills), so choose a heavy ceramic dish or, even better, a food dish that latches to the cage bars. Check pet retailers for latching food dishes designed specifically for ferrets. Attach multiple water bottles to the cage bars.
