Cooking Kippers under the Broiler or Grill Pre-heat the oven and cover a sheet pan with foil. The oven needs to be hot before you stick the pan in, so set it to \"broil.\" Line a baking sheet with foil, so that it won't absorb the fishiness of the kippers. In British cooking, \"grilling\" refers to cooking under the heating element in the oven, known as the grill. In the United States, this type of cooking is called \"broiling.\" Melt butter in a saucepan until it turns brown and nutty. Using 2-3 pats per kipper, heat the butter over medium heat until it's turning golden brown. Spread some on the baking tray to keep the kippers from sticking. You can heat the butter in the microwave, though you won't get the browned butter flavor. Place the fish on the tray skin-side up and brush with butter. If your fillets have skin, put the skin facing upwards. If they don't have skin still, that's fine, too. Brush melted butter on the skin or the top side of the fish using a basting brush. Cook the fish for 1 minute on the first side. The skin should cook for about a minute while facing up, but then you need to flip the fish so the flesh is facing upward. Flip the fish and baste it again. Take the pan out, and turn the fish over with a spatula. Brush the top of the fish with melted butter using a basting brush, then put the pan back in the oven. Baste the fish another 2-3 times. About every 1-2 minutes, pull the pan out and add a little more butter to the top of the fish. This helps fully incorporate the butter flavor into the kippers. Cook the fish on this side for 4-6 minutes. However, if you don't want to use that much butter, just stick to basting the kippers once on each side. Pull the kippers out and serve them.
