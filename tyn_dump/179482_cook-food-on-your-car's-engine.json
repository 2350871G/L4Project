Instead cook a dish that fits your trip.

If you're taking a long road trip, you can cook just about anything\u2014roasts, complete meals with Potato side dishes, etc.\u2014but even a quick commute affords you enough time to heat up a pre-cooked breakfast sandwich, for example, or make some hot dogs.
