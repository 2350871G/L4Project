Spray-Painting onto Cardboard Choose a well-ventilated and sheltered area to spray paint. Always make sure there is plenty of airflow when you use spray paints as the fumes can be toxic. Spray paint cans work best in warm, dry and sheltered conditions. If it is cold, windy, or damp outside, work inside a garage that has good ventilation or wait until a finer day.
