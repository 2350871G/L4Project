Choose a type of veil material with fairly wide mesh, such as Russian or French netting. You can also find netting that is specifically marketed as birdcage veil netting.Tip: Birdcage veils are traditionally made with wide \u201cfishnet\u201d style netting, but you don\u2019t need to feel restricted to that. Consider experimenting with tulle, lace, or even multiple veil materials to create a unique look. You can purchase veil netting online or from a craft or fabric store. Veil netting comes in a huge variety colors and finishes. You can even get metallic netting!"
