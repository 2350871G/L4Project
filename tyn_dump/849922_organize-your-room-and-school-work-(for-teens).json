If your room is in a bad state and the thought of cleaning it all makes you overwhelmed and slightly panicked, remember one rule: You can do anything for fifteen minutes. Just do fifteen minutes of work at a time, then take a break and look at what you've accomplished. Take a few minutes off if you have to (but a few minutes doesn't have to mean the rest of the day).

Organizing your schoolwork Use the music and fifteen-minute rule described in Part One if you like.  Go through your school binders and your backpack. Clean out all the papers you don't need and either file them for studying for exams or recycle them. (this is easiest at the end of a quarter/semester, but can be done anytime).

Leave one or two tabs for each of your classes at school, depending on how many papers that the teacher usually hands out. Label the very first tab of each class with the name of that class. Look at all of the papers you decided to keep from the first step and put them in the right place.  Staying organized with a sanity saver book Keep things organized once sorted. That will keep chaos and stress from messing up your life. To do that, we are going to make a Sanity Saver Journal. Get a 4X6 photo album. It should be pretty and something you will like using. It should have plastic sleeves in it for pictures. Make sure it can hold at least 20 pictures. That is ten sleeves with 2 in each sleeve.
