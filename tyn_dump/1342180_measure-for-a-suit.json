        "Learn how coat length is determined.",
        "Coat length is based on height, so you should be able to know what size coat you\u2019ll need if you know size of the dress shirts you get and your height.",
        "A short is typically made for people under 5\u20197, with sleeves up to 32 in.",
        "A regular is for people between 5\u20198 and 5\u201911, with sleeves of 32-33 in.",
        "A long is for people between 6\u20190 and 6\u20192, with sleeves of 34-36 in.",
        "An extra-long is for people taller than 6\u20192, with sleeves longer than 36 in.",
        "Make sure the armholes aren\u2019t snug.",
        "When you try a jacket on, the armholes should be loose enough that you feel comfortable and have a full range of motion.",
        "In a new suit, you don't want to risk ripping the interior lining of the jacket because it's too snug.",
        "You may be able to get an improperly fitting jacket tailored.",
        "Confirm that the coat is smooth across your back.",
        "Coats shouldn't look bunched up across your back shoulders.",
        "They should create a smooth surface across your back and shoulders, with clean lines that flatter your build.",
        "If you have bunching, you may have a jacket that's too small, poorly stitched, or just the wrong size.",
        "Make sure the sleeves are the appropriate length.",
        "Let your arms hang loosely at your sides to check and make sure the sleeves are of the appropriate length.",
        "The sleeve hem should hang down your knuckles, and reveal about a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the shirt cuff when your arms are extended out in front of you.",
        "Check that the pants are the correct length.",
        "Trousers should be hemmed evenly with the heel of your shoe, gently breaking on the top of the shoe.",
        "They shouldn't drape too much or bunch, and should hang over the shoes gently.",
        "If the length is wrong, it\u2019s very easy to get your pants hemmed by a tailor."
