                    "description": "Any room can be adapted into a recording room, but your garage causes your drums to sound differently than your bedroom does. Large rooms with a lot of flat spaces create more echo and reverb. Small rooms with carpeting and furniture lead to quieter drumming. If you want to record the drums and add reverb later, opt for a quiet space such as a room in your house. For a louder, more lively sound, choose a space like a garage with flat surfaces and not a lot of furniture."

        "Tape pressure zone microphones (PZMs) to the wall to create ambiance.",
        "Place some extra mics around the room to record better sound quality.",
        "The mics should all be placed in front of the drum kit.",
        "They can be set to the left and right of the drum kit, in the room's corners, or even outside the door.",
        "Tape them to vertical surfaces with masking tape or Duct tape.",
        "PZM mics can be replaced with other mics, such as condensers and ribbon mics.",
        "However, PZM mics are far more affordable.",
        "Reposition the microphones to achieve the sound you want.",
        "Setting up the microphones involves a lot of trial and error.",
        "Experiment by playing and recording the drums.",
        "Keep adjusting all of the mics you have available.",
        "Even the smallest adjustment can drastically change the recording.",
        "For example, sound from 1 drum can bleed over and get picked up by another drum's mic.",
        "Raise or lower the mics to fix this.",
        "Capturing the Drumming Tune the drums to the perfect sound.",
        "Use a drum key to tighten the tension rods on all of the drums.",
        "Both sides of each drum need to be tuned evenly and in concert with the other drums.",
        "Aim for clear, even tones from the drums and continue adjusting them to get the sounds you desire.",
        "Use the key to loosen the tension and change out the drum heads.",
        "All drum heads produce different sounds, so they are an essential part of tuning.",
        "Plug the microphones into your mixer and computer.",
        "Gather up all the microphone cords and slot them into the mixer.",
        "Follow the labels on the mixer and the owner's manual to do this correctly.",
        "Plug the mixer into a USB-interface, then connect the interface to a USB port on your computer.",
        "Electronic drum kits plug directly into your computer.",
        "Be aware that they are meant for beginners, so they aren't usually great for recording.",
        "Test the drums and microphones for sound quality.",
        "Before you begin playing, give your drum kit a test run.",
        "Strike all the drums as you would while playing.",
        "Make sure they sound full and tuned properly.",
        "Play back the recordings to hear what the microphones are picking up.",
        "Change your playing style to change your sound.",
        "The way you strike the drums matters.",
        "Striking the center of a drum produces a fuller sound.",
        "Hitting it harder can lead to more distortion.",
        "If you are struggling to get the sound you want, your playing style may be the difference.",
        "Record your drumming with a computer program.",
        "Once all the components are in place and hooked up, turn on your recording and mixing software.",
        "Have fun playing!",
        "Programs such as Audacity, GarageBand, or Reaper are perfect for recording and editing."
