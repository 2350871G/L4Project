The gas feed valve is typically located on the bottom part of the torch head near where it rests on top of the tank. Before assembling the torch, make sure the nozzle is closed so it doesn\u2019t start emitting gas right away. Turn the valve clockwise as much as you can. Most propane torches consist of 2 components, which are the torch head and the gas canister. The torch head is detachable and is left off of the tank for safety reasons. If you don\u2019t close the valve, propane may start coming out before you\u2019re ready for it. It could be dangerous if anything causes the torch to ignite unexpectedly."
