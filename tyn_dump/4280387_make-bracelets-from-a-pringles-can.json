How much you actually end up using depends on the width of your bracelet, the width of your ribbon, and how much you overlap the ribbon.

If you cannot find any Pringles cans, find another cardboard can that is wide enough for you to fit your hand into. Some pre-made, refrigerated pastry doughs come in cans that might be wide enough for this. Wash and dry the inside of the can. Rinse the inside of the can with soap and water, then dry it off with a towel. If the outside of the can got wet and soggy, set the can out in the sun for a few hours to dry. Cut the rim and bottom off of the can. It is better to do this first so that you don't accidentally include them in your measurements. Simply make a hole in the side of the can just below the rim, then cut around the can to remove the rim. Repeat this step for the bottom of the can. You can do this with a sharp pair of scissors or with a craft blade. Make a mark on the side of the can 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top. Your bracelet will be  1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. If you want the bracelet to be wider, make the mark lower. If you want the bracelet to be narrower, make the mark higher. A black or blue permanent marker or ballpoint pen will work the best for this. Trace around the can based on the mark that you drew.

If you notice any unevenness or \"fuzz,\" cut it off with a pair of scissors. Do not get too carried away, however, or your bracelet will end up too narrow! Creating a Ribbon Wrapped Bracelet Choose a ribbon to wrap around the bracelet. Choose a satin or grosgrain ribbon in a color that you like.

If the ribbon is too narrow, you won't be able to cover the bracelet completely, and if the ribbon is too wide, it will wrinkle when you wrap it.
