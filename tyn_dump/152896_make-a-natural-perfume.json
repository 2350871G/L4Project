This creates a 2% dilution of oils, which is safe for use on your skin. For a sample mixture, if you\u2019re making a lemongrass scent with peppermint, use 10 drops of peppermint and 15 drops of lemongrass in 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of rectified spirits to make the lemongrass the dominant scent. In general, the ratio of the oils will depend on your personal preference. You can always adjust the scent by adding more essential oils if it isn\u2019t strong enough.
