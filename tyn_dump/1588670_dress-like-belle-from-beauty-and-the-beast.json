You can sew layers of stiff tulle under the skirt, but it won\u2019t be as poofy. The tulle may also be scratchy and uncomfortable.

This means that if your dress is pale yellow, you should wear pale yellow shoes. If it is bright yellow, stick with bright yellow shoes. Close-toed high heels will look the best. Make sure that they are comfortable. After all, Belle is a practical girl who prefers comfort over aesthetics.

Ideally, the gloves should go past your elbow and hit the middle of your upper arm. The easiest option would be to buy a pair of lycra or spandex costume gloves, then dye them with fabric dye to match your dress.

For example:\nTo mimic the animated look, twist the ponytail into a bun, then secure it with a gold bun holder. To mimic the live-action look, leave the half-up ponytail loose, but add a delicate, gold hair clip to it. Something with vines, branches, or feathers would be ideal.

Avoid going too heavy on the makeup, lipstick, and blush, however. You want to look pretty, but not like a porcelain doll. For example:\nKeep your eyeshadow neutral with browns and ivories. You can add some gold, however. You can\u2019t go wrong with mascara and eyeliner. You can also add some false lashes, if you are going to a formal event, such as a prom. You can wear some blush, but keep it light. Use just enough to give your cheeks some color and life, but not so much that it becomes evident. Skip the red lipstick. Instead, choose a natural, pinkish shade. You can also wear some lip gloss over that."

For example:\nYou can wear a plain peasant blouse, a lace blouse, or a button-up blouse. Something with longer sleeves will work the best. A dress with thick straps will look the most accurate, but you can wear something with skinny straps. For a modern take, try a blue skirt instead; this would work well with a button-up blouse.

For a dapper or vintage look, try a high-waisted full-circle skirt with a white or yellow puffed-sleeve blouse. For a girly look, try a full-circle or A-line dress made from yellow lace.

You may be able to find a licensed pattern for Belle\u2019s peasant dress from the live-action version of the film. It should also be in the \u201ccostumes\u201d section. Find a pattern for a simple blouse with a rounded, V-neck collar. Belle\u2019s blouse has a very specific design, especially in the collar, so you may have to do more altering for this one. Look for a sewing pattern that has full sleeves, with an open collar. Belle has \u00be-length sleeves. You may have to shorten the sleeves on your pattern.

For example:\nTo mimic the animated look, twist the ponytail into a bun, then secure it with a gold bun holder. To mimic the live-action look, leave the half-up ponytail loose, but add a delicate, gold hair clip to it. Something with vines, branches, or feathers would be ideal. Add gentle waves to the ends of your hair to mimic both the animated and live-action look. If you want the Broadway look, add ringlets to your hair with a curling iron instead. Don\u2019t be afraid to wear makeup, but keep your look simple. Even when she dressed up, Belle kept her makeup simple. You can certainly wear foundation and concealer, and if you know how to do contouring--all the better! Avoid going too heavy on the makeup, lipstick, and blush, however. You want to look pretty, but not like a porcelain doll. For example:\nKeep your eyeshadow neutral with browns and ivories. You can add some gold, however. You can\u2019t go wrong with mascara and eyeliner. You can also add some false lashes, if you are going to a formal event, such as a prom. You can wear some blush, but keep it light. Use just enough to give your cheeks some color and life, but not so much that it becomes evident. Skip the red lipstick. Instead, choose a natural, pinkish shade. You can also wear some lip gloss over that. Consider some accessories. While not absolutely necessary, these can add a nice touch to your outfit. For example, if you could wear some pearl earrings or a gold necklace. You can also add some details to your dress, such as roses or beaded trim. Disney Bounding as Belle Understand the Disney bounding is different from cosplaying. Unfortunately, most Disney parks no longer allow teens and adults to wear costumes. They do allow you to wear outfits that are inspired by the characters, however. This is known as Disney bounding. The key to Disney bounding is to wear similar shapes and colors that the character wears. Disney bounding is not cosplaying. If you look too much like the character, the park employees may ask you to change. Pair a white blouse with a blue dress or skirt for Belle\u2019s peasant look. A white blouse with \u00be-length sleeves and a sleeveless dress that comes down to your mid-calf will look the most accurate, but you can do some variations. For example:\nYou can wear a plain peasant blouse, a lace blouse, or a button-up blouse. Something with longer sleeves will work the best. A dress with thick straps will look the most accurate, but you can wear something with skinny straps. For a modern take, try a blue skirt instead; this would work well with a button-up blouse. Add a blue or white cardigan if you want to mimic the live-action look. Something with floral embroidery would lend a nice country feel to it. Wear yellow dresses or skirts if you want the ball gown look. As long as you get the right accessories and hair, your dress should still give off the Belle vibes. You can make it more Belle-like by wearing something with lace in it. For example:\nFor a casual look, pair a yellow maxi skirt with a lacy, off-the-shoulder blouse. For a dapper or vintage look, try a high-waisted full-circle skirt with a white or yellow puffed-sleeve blouse. For a girly look, try a full-circle or A-line dress made from yellow lace. You could make it more Belle-like with a gold or rose-red belt. Match your shoes to the outfit or to the theme. Here is where you can get a little creative. If you want to make your outfit more accurate, you should wear the same type of shoes that Belle wears in the movies. If you don\u2019t care about accuracy, then choose something with a rose theme instead. For example:\nAnimated peasant dress: black ballet flats or black pumps. Live-action peasant dress: brown shoes\nAnimated or live-action ball gown: pale yellow or gold flats, pumps, or heels\nNon-accurate shoes: anything with a rose or \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d motif. Complete your look with a low ponytail or a half-up ponytail. Belle\u2019s hair is simple, and when it comes to Disney bounding, you really don\u2019t have to make it accurate. As long as you get the general shape of the hairstyle, you are good to go. For Belle\u2019s peasant look, do a flipped ponytail. Finish the look with a blue bow. For Belle\u2019s ball gown look, do a half-up ponytail. You can leave it at that, or twist it into a bun. Keep your makeup simple. Everyday makeup is just fine for Belle, regardless of which version you do. Start with a base of foundation or tinted moisturizer, then apply some eyeliner and mascara. If you want to, add some eyeshadow, blush, and lip gloss, but keep it light. Stick with neutral eyeshadow colors, like brown, for Belle\u2019s peasant look. For the ball gown, you can try gold instead. Pink lip gloss will work just fine for Belle\u2019s peasant look, but if you are doing her ball gown, you can wear a deeper shade of pink lipstick. Add rose or book-themed accessories to look more Belle-like. This is where you can make your Disneybound more recognizable without going into cosplay territory. For example, you could use bags, jewelry, or hair pins with the following themes:\nBooks\nRoses\nTeacups\nHand-held mirrors Don\u2019t be afraid to buy accessories based on the movies. If you look hard enough, you can actually buy a purse or necklace that looks like Chip, Cogsworth, or Lumi\u00e8re. You can find these items in stores like Disney and Hot Topic, but independent artists on Etsy may also sell them. You can also make your own accessory. For example, you can paint the characters on a pair of canvas sneakers with fabric paints or markers.",

        "It is just a rectangle attached to a band that wraps around your waist and ties in the back with a bow.",
        "It does not cover the chest or have any fancy gathers.",
        "You can buy one from a costume shop, online, or make one using a large rectangle for the base, and a skinny strip for the strap.",
        "Sew the costume according to the pattern using cotton or linen fabric.",

        "Keep your makeup simple.",
        "Belle is one of the more practical Disney princesses, and doesn\u2019t wear makeup until she dances with the Beast in her ballgown.",

        "If you want to wear makeup, feel free to do so, but try to keep the colors neutral.",
        "For example:\nInstead of wearing full-on foundation, try a tinted moisturizer.",

        "Because her dress is so iconic, you probably won\u2019t be able to find a regular dress pattern that is exactly the same.",
        "You will either have to use the licensed replica pattern, or you will have to use a similar pattern and modify it.",
        "For the licensed pattern, browse through the costumes section of a pattern book.",
        "The pattern will say \u201cDisney\u201d and \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d on it.",
        "Alternatively, choose a regular dress pattern with a skirt and corset.",
        "If this is for a little girl, a 1-piece dress with a full skirt would work well.",
        "Choose nice fabrics for Belle\u2019s ball gown.",
        "Since this is a formal dress, you don\u2019t want to use plain cotton.",
        "Pale yellow satin is a classic choice for both the skirt and bodice.",

        "Buy or make a hoop skirt and cotton petticoat.",
        "Hoop skirts sound more intimidating than they actually are, but they are the key to creating a puffy princess dress.",
        "You should also make a fabric petticoat to wear over the hoop skirt; otherwise, the ribs on the hoop skirt will appear as unsightly lines on the finished dress.",
        "You can sew layers of stiff tulle under the skirt, but it won\u2019t be as poofy.",
        "The tulle may also be scratchy and uncomfortable.",
        "When getting dressed, put the hoop skirt on first, then the petticoat and dress.",
        "If your dress is 2 pieces, put the skirt on before the bodice.",
        "Match your shoes to your dress.",
        "Rather than wearing a pair of any old gold shoes, you should match your shoes to your dress instead.",

        "If it is bright yellow, stick with bright yellow shoes.",
        "Close-toed high heels will look the best.",
        "Make sure that they are comfortable.",
        "After all, Belle is a practical girl who prefers comfort over aesthetics.",
        "Keep the heel low--something between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5.1 cm) would work the best.",
        "Finish off with long gloves that match your dress.",
        "Like with the shoes, don\u2019t wear just any yellow gloves and call it a day.",
        "Try to match them to 1 of the yellow shades that\u2019s on your dress.",
        "Ideally, the gloves should go past your elbow and hit the middle of your upper arm.",
        "The easiest option would be to buy a pair of lycra or spandex costume gloves, then dye them with fabric dye to match your dress.",
        "Alternatively, you can make the gloves using matching lycra or spandex fabric.",
        "Choose fabric with a shiny finish; it will look fancier than matte fabric.",
        "Wear your hair in a half-up style.",
        "Start by pulling your hair into a half-up ponytail that\u2019s about ear level.",
