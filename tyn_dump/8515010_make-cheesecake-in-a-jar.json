Melt the butter in a little saucepan over the stove or in the microwave. Pack the graham cracker mixture into the bottom of your mason jars. You have enough mixture to fill about eight 4-ounce (120-milliliter) mason jars. Scoop the mixture into the jars with a spoon first. Next, pat the mixture down with the end of a wooden spoon. Set the jars aside when you are done. Use less mixture for a thinner crust. Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and lemon juice. Place the cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and lemon juice. Beat everything together until combined. Don't like lemon juice? Use \u00bc teaspoon of vanilla extract instead. Beat the heavy whipping cream separately. Pour the heavy whipping cream into a chilled bowl. Beat it on medium speed until it turns light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. You can use a hand-held beater, an electric mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks. Use a rubber spatula to fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often so that everything gets evenly mixed together. Spoon the cheesecake into the jars. When you done, gently tap the jars against the counter. This will help settle the cheesecake and reduce air pockets. Top the jars off with the blueberry topping. If you did not make the blueberry topping, you can top it off with your favorite pie topping, such as strawberry or cherry. You can also top it off with fresh, sliced strawberries and whipped cream.
