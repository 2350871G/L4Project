If the angle isn't perpendicular to the tire, it'll stick out one side or the other. Do one hole and screw at a time. Don't try drilling all the holes, then installing screws...you'll drive yourself crazy trying to find which knob you drilled. Put duct tape over the screws on the inside of the tire; sometimes it is best to use two layers of tape. You can purchase \"tire liners\" (there are a few brands include Slime and Mr. Tuffy) that are designed to go in between the tube and the tire instead of using duct tape to protect the tube. Mount the tires back on the rims. Getting the tires mounted on the rims will be difficult, comparable to wrestling a rabid porcupine. Using Tires with Tubes Take wheels off of the bicycle, and the plain tires off  the wheels.  Find places to put screws through the tires. You will need to find spaces in the tread pattern if your tires aren't bald (remember now, only put them through the outer sides and perfectly in the middle... easiest if you only use the sides). Mark the points, and then use the screwdriver/drill to pierce through the points you marked. But be careful to drill a very small hole so that it takes you some moderate effort and time to put the screws like mentioned below. This will prevent it from collapsing inside. Put the screws pointing outward, then thread the nuts over the screws that poke through the tire. The nuts have now become your studs. Put duct tape over the screws on the inside of the tire; sometimes it is best to use two layers of tape.  Put the tires back on the rims (with tubes inside of course) and then place them back on the bike nice and tight.  Using a Chain and Clips This method is by far the most reliable and easy to apply. However, it is only possible on bicycles without rim brakes. Get yourself the materials needed for this method.  Take wheels off the bike and measure the cylindrical diameter of the tyres (with rims).  Cut the measured length pieces (12 - 18) of the chain so it fits tightly with the tyre.  Fix the chain at its place with steel clips or some iron wire. Nuts and screws can also be used. Mount the tires back on the bike.
