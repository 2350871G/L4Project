If your hands are sensitive or the clove is particularly dry, hit a hard bowl against the top of the clove instead. Set a few aside if you don't plan to use them all. Place your garlic cloves between two metal or ceramic bowls. Cover the bowl with a lid or another, upside-down bowl. Alternatively, you can place your cloves inside an old, sturdy plastic bottle and screw the top tightly. Small to medium bowls work best. The cloves need to bang against each other to shake off their skin. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds. Make sure you hear the garlic slamming against the sides of the container. Separate your bowls or open your bottle. Pour out the garlic cloves and the skins. They should be fully peeled. If some of your cloves are only partially peeled, shake them for a few more seconds as hard as you can. Smashing with a Flat Knife Place the flat side of a chef's knife over the garlic clove. Do this on a flat, stable surface. Make sure to face the sharp edge of the blade away from you. Press with your palm to smash the clove quickly and carefully. Place your outstretched palm over the blade, then push downward with a quick, light blow. The goal here isn\u2019t to completely pulverize the garlic clove, but rather to break apart the peel from the rest of the garlic.
