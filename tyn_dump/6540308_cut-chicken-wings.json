The wing should bend in two places, and each bend corresponds to one joint. The rounded end previously connected to the body of the chicken is the drumette.

Once you've visually identified both joints, use your fingers to feel for the areas that seem hollow or loose.

Before \"Frenching\" the chicken wings, you'll need to separate each whole wing into its three separate pieces following the standard method. Discard the wing tip as usual. You can make French cuts using both the drumettes and wingettes. French cuts separate the meat and skin from a portion of the bone. The meat sits on one end of the wing piece and the exposed bone presents itself as a neat \"handle\" for easy gripping. Saw through the skin of the drumette. Use a sharp knife to saw through the skin at the thin bottom of the drumette. Work around the entire bottom, stopping once the skin seems completely disconnected there. Firmly pinch the exposed bone between your fingers with one hand while cutting the skin with the other hand. Use a gently sawing motion to separate the skin.
