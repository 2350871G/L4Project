Start with an understanding that Honesty is a value and not an attribute. Each value has a denominator. Fix your denominator for this value. Start with the conviction that no one is either 100% or 0% honest. Grid yourself: somewhere in between the extremes. Start being less dishonest every day and slowly graduate to being more honest every day. If you feel that you are more honest today than you were yesterday move yourself up the grid a little. Be very conservative and mean while grading yourself. Let your physical being work hard and deliver definitive measurable results to convince your inner being. Don\u2019t be charitable to yourself, but celebrate small success. This will encourage and motivate you to raise the bar daily and perhaps even many times in a day. Keep comparing the percentage daily/weekly growth and set new goals."
