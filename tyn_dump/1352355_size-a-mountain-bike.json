Full-suspension bikes have much better shocks and can handle more aggressive riding. The hardtail is more versatile and lighter, however, in trade. Measuring Yourself and the Bike Measure your inseam. To know what size bike is right for you (what length seat tube you need), start with your inseam. To do this:\nStand up straight with your back against a wall, a book between your legs like the bike's seat. Use a tape measure to calculate the distance between your pubic bone and the floor. Measure your bike's seat tube, if applicable. If you already have a bike, you'll want to know if it's the right size for you.
