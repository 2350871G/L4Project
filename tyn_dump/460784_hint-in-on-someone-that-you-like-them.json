For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re sitting near your crush in the cafeteria. Lean in their direction to show you\u2019re focused on what they have to say.

When you\u2019re talking to them, lightly touch their arm, shoulder, or knee for 1-2 seconds. Watch how they react to see if they feel comfortable with your touch. If they seem comfortable, try touching them again. For instance, you might ask the person to explain an assignment to you. While they\u2019re talking, lean in close and lightly touch their arm. If the person flinches, pulls away, or sinks under your touch, they probably don\u2019t like it, so stop touching them immediately. It\u2019s important to respect people\u2019s personal space."
