Once there, secure the ends in a knot. Cutting the thread with sharp scissors and licking the end can make it easier to guide through the eye of the needle.

Mastering Other Stitches Practice a closer stitch. The basting stitch, as described above, is good for a start. However, the bigger the stitches, the more likely it is to tear or come out. The basting stitch has a long stitch length -- sturdier stitches have medium or short stitch lengths. When piercing through the right side to the wrong side of your fabric, the next pierce should be as close to the former stitch as possible. Start zig-zag stitching. This is a stitch that goes back and forth and is used when a straight stitch just won't do, like to reinforce buttonholes or in working with stretchable fabrics.

Sew two pieces of fabric together. If you're upgrading to this step, put your fabric together so that their wrong sides face outwards (and their right sides are together). Line up the edges along which you want to join them. Sew in a line that follows the edges. Once you're done, pull the pieces apart. They'll be held together at the seam you just sewed, but the thread will be barely visible. A better way to do this, however, is by slip stitching. Patch a hole. Sewing a rip or tear isn't too difficult. Just pinch the edges of the hole together, towards the inside (the wrong side). Sew the edges together in a seam.
