The width of the fabric on the bolt (about 60 inches/ 152.4 centimeters) will make the width of the cloak. You will also need a 17 by 22-inch (43.18 by 55.88-centimeter) piece for the hood, and a larger piece for the body of the cloak. Choose a dark purple/purple-blue fabric. Velvet works well for this, but you can also use a shiny spandex color, often labeled as \"super hero\" spandex. Be sure to get some extra material for the boot covers and cuffs."

If you are making the body suit from a pattern, extend the sleeves down towards your knuckles. If you can't find any long-sleeves leotards, search for a full bodysuit with a turtleneck.

You will most likely have to look for the tights online. Some well-stocked costume shops and dance supply stores may also sell them. The tights must be sheer to the wait.

    "text": " Creating the Cloak and Body Suit Find lots of reference pictures. You will need images of her from the front, back, and side. Additional angles will also help, but aren't necessary. Print out the images or have them easily available on your phone, laptop, tablet, etc. Find close-ups of her accessories, such as her face, belt, boots, etc. Consider having a few photos that other cosplayers did of her so that you can see how she translates to real life. Cut the pieces for the cloak. The body of the cloak needs to be long enough to go from your shoulder down to your calf, plus an additional inch (2.54 centimeters) for seam allowances. The width of the fabric on the bolt (about 60 inches/ 152.4 centimeters) will make the width of the cloak. You will also need a 17 by 22-inch (43.18 by 55.88-centimeter) piece for the hood, and a larger piece for the body of the cloak. Choose a dark purple/purple-blue fabric. Velvet works well for this, but you can also use a shiny spandex color, often labeled as \"super hero\" spandex. Be sure to get some extra material for the boot covers and cuffs. Hem the edges of the pieces. You will need to hem both of the 17-inch (43.18-centimeter) long edges on the hood piece. You will also need to hem the 60-inch (152.4-centimeter) bottom edge of the cloak, and both of the side edges. Hem the fabric by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters). Sew it using a matching thread color and a straight stitch. Fold the hood in half widthwise and sew along one of the narrow edges. Fold the hood in half so that so that the right sides are together. Sew along one of the 11-inch (27.94-centimeter) edges. Use a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance, a matching thread color, and a stretch stitch. Gather the top edge on the cloak. Sew two straight lines across the remaining, un-hemmed 60-inch (cc-centimeter) edge of the cloak. Use a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance for the first line, and a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance for the second line. Grab both of the bobbin threads on one side of the cloak, then pull on the threads until the top edge of the cloak is the same length as the bottom edge of the hood. Use a straight stitch for this, not a stretch stitch. Repeat this step for the top edge on the cloak. Pin and sew the hood and cloak together. Pin the bottom, straight edge of the hood to the top, gathered edge of the cloak. Make sure that the edges match up, then sew them together using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Use a stretch stitch for this. For a nicer finish, go over the raw edges with a zigzag stitch. Add some sort of closure to the cloak. You will eventually be adding a brooch to it, but you still want some sort of support. You can sew a piece of black ribbon (or a matching color) to the seam on either side of the hood. You can also sew a large hook and eye to the front of the cloak instead. Buy or make the bodysuit. Buy a black leotard with long sleeves and a turtle neck; make sure that it doesn't have legs. Alternatively, you can make a bodysuit using a suitable pattern and black jersey, spandex, or matte pleather. If you are making the body suit from a pattern, extend the sleeves down towards your knuckles. If you can't find any long-sleeves leotards, search for a full bodysuit with a turtleneck. Cut off the legs, using a swimsuit as a guide, then hem them using black thread and a stretch stitch. Modify the sleeves on the body suit. Cut the top of the cuffs into points that reach the base of your middle finger. Next, cut the underside of the cuffs into a straight line that ends at your wrist. Hem the cuffs using black thread and a stretch stitch. Add a loop of black or clear elastic to each point. You will slip the loops over your middle finger when wearing the suit, so make them loose enough. Get a pair of opaque, grayish tights. Raven has grayish skin, so you will need to paint your face (and hands, if possible) to get the right look. You'll need a pair of matching, opaque tights as well. Test out your makeup on your wrist to see what color it will be against your skin, then buy tights that match that color. You will be wearing the tights under the bodysuit. You will most likely have to look for the tights online. Some well-stocked costume shops and dance supply stores may also sell them. The tights must be sheer to the wait. Do not get tights that have a \"control\" top that comes down to the thighs. This will create a line across your thighs. Use the leftover cloak material to make the cuffs, if desired. Cut a rectangle long enough to wrap around your wrist, plus 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for seam allowances, and twice the width you want it. Fold the rectangle in half lengthwise, wrong sides together, and sew the long edge using a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance, matching thread, and a stretch stitch. Assemble the cuffs by doing the following:\nTurn the tube right-side-out. Fold one of the raw edges inward by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters). Tuck the remaining raw edge into the tube to form a ring. Stitch along the seam using a straight stitch or a ladder stitch. Making the Boot Covers Get a pair of black, short booties. The boots need to come up a few inches/centimeters past your ankle, but still fall below your calf. They need to be smooth, without any lacing or fancy embellishments. The boots should fit loosely around your ankles. Rubber rain boots would work especially well for this. If you can only find boots that lace up, remove the shoe laces, and glue the sides to the tongue so that it holds together. If the rain boots are too tall, cut them down! Wrap your excess cloak fabric around your boot. Hold the fabric snugly against the back of the boot, and begin pinning it down the front and along the top and toe area. Extend the pattern about 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 centimeters) above the top of your boot, pinning it as well. Make sure that the wrong side is facing out. Repeat this step for the other boot. Alternatively, you can loosely stitch the fabric around the boot instead. Remove the slip cover, and cut off the excess fabric. When you remove the fabric, you'll have a square or rectangular piece of folded fabric, with sewing pins running down it in a boot shape. Cut along the pinned area, adding a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Do this for both pairs of boots. Remember to make the boot covers 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 centimeters) taller than your boot. Sew the boot covers. Sew along the edge that your cut, leaving the top and bottom edges raw. Use a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance, a matching thread color, and a stretch stitch. Turn the boot covers right-side-out. It would be a good idea to cut notches into the curved parts of the seam. This will allow the boot covers to lay more smoothly. Slip the boot covers over the boots and glue them in place. Slip a boot cover over the matching boot. Make sure that the bottom edge lines up with the top of the sole. Cut off the excess fabric, if needed, or tuck it underneath. Secure the bottom edge of the boot cover to the boot with shoe glue (ie: Shoe Goop) or industrial-strength glue (ie: E6000). Stick sewing pins through the boot cover and into the boot. This will help pin the cover in place while the blue dries. Repeat this step for the other boot. Hide the seam with a strip of black foam. Cut a \u00bd to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide strip of black craft foam that's long enough to wrap around the base of your boot. Glue it to the boot so that it covers the seam between the boot cover and the sole. Use shoe glue or industrial-strength glue for this. Fold down the top part of the boot cover. Fold the top edge inward first, then fold it down outward. This will give the boots that slouched/scrunched look without showing off the seam. Making the Belt, Arm, and Brooch Mix the resin and the dye. Purchase a clear, two-part casting resin from the craft store. Prepare it according to the instructions on the box, then mix some translucent red dye into it. Keep stirring the resin until no streaks remain. You can also use a pea-sized drop of red acrylic paint to color the resin. Pour the resin into your moulds. Purchase some half-dome molds meant for casting resin. They need to be about 1 \u00bd to 2 inches (cc to 5.08 centimeters) in diameter. Coat the inside of each cavity with mould release, then\nIf the moulds are very deep, you can fill them partway, but make sure that you fill each cavity the same amount. If you can't find resin casting moulds in the right shape and size, try silicone moulds instead. Allow the resin to cure before removing it from the moulds. Each brand of resin is a little different, so the curing times may vary. Expect this to take about 24 hours, however. Create more gems using the same technique. You will need 6 to 8 for the belt, 2 for each hand, and 1 for the brooch). It might be a good idea to make a few extras, however, in case you mess something up. For an even more accurate cosplay, make the gems for the hands slightly smaller, and the gem for the brooch slightly bigger. Glue black felt or fabric to the gems. Trace the gems onto a sheet of black fabric or fabric. Cut the circles out just inside the tracing. Glue each circle to the back of each gem with industrial-strength glue (ie: E6000). A high-quality fabric glue may also work. If your gems are translucent, consider painting the back of them with white, gold, or silver paint first. This will help brighten them up. Glue the gems into large, gold rings. Purchase a set of gold rings that are about the same diameter as your gems. Curtain rings (clips removed) or belt rings will work especially well for this. Coat the bottom edge of each gem with industrial-strength glue, then slide the ring onto it. You can also use curtain grommets instead. If they aren't already gold, you can color them with spray paint. If you can't find any rings at all, outline each gem with hot glue, then paint the glue gold once it sets. You can also use a gold cord instead. Glue 6 to 8 gems to a gold chain. Purchase a thick, gold chain that's long enough to wrap around your hips without sliding off. Glue the gems to the chain, making sure to center them and space them evenly. Depending on the length of the chain, you should be able to fit 6 to 8 gems. You can purchase chains from fabric stores and arts and crafts stores. Use heavy-duty wire cutters to cut them apart, or use pliers to open up one of the rings. Glue a strip of black felt or fabric to the back of each gem to cover and secure the chain further. Add a clasp and hook so that you can wear the belt. Purchase a large, gold clasp or hook that matches your chain. Use a pair of pliers to up one of the last links on the chain, and slide the hook onto it. Use the pliers again to close the link. Repeat the process for the ring part of the closure. If the links are hard to open, or too thick for the chain, you will need to use a jump ring to secure the two together. Use one of your gems to make the brooch. Place a large safety pin against the back of the gem. Cut a thin strip of fabric that is a little shorter than your gem, and a little narrower than the inside of your safety pin. Coat the back of the strip with glue, then use it to secure the safety pin to the back of the gem. You can use a flat-backed safety pin, if you can find one that's large enough. You'll still want to add a strip of fabric over the base for added security. Secure the remaining two gems to the ends of the sleeves. The gems need to go right over the part that covers the back of your hand. You can glue the gems directly to the fabric, but an even better idea would be to secure them with Velcro. This way, you can remove the gems in order to wash the bodysuit. Buy or create the forehead gem. You may be able to find a similar diamond-shaped gem online. If you can't, you can make your own using hot glue. Make a ball with clay, such as play dough. Create a diamond-shaped well in the clay with knife. Fill the dent with hot glue, then smooth out the back. Let the glue set, then remove the gem. Paint the gem red with permanent marker or nail polish. Let it dry, then seal it with clear nail polish or glossy sealer. Doing the Hair and Makeup Pin your hair up under a wig cap. Braid or prep your hair for wig wearing as usual. Pin it up, then cover it with a wig cap. If you will be wearing contacts with this cosplay, you should put them in at this point as well. If you are going to wear contacts, look for purple or white. Do not put the wig on yet. Prep your face. Wash your face, apply toner, then moisturizer. It would be a good idea to apply some primer as well; this will help fill in your pores and make your face appear smoother. Apply a light gray, water-based foundation to your face. Get a pan of water-based foundation and add a few drops of water to it. Apply the foundation to your face using a makeup sponge and a patting motion. Make sure that you cover your ears, lips, and neck as well. Do not rub the sponge against your face. You can also try an aqua colored foundation instead. It will look grayish against most skin types. Allow the foundation to dry, then apply contouring. Use a soft, fluffy brush and gray powder makeup (ie: matte eyeshadow), and apply contouring to your hairline, temples, and below the cheekbones. Use a smaller brush (ie: eyeshadow brush) to apply more contouring down the sides of your nose. If the foundation looks sheer, add a second layer before you do any contouring. Be sure to let it dry as well. Apply highlighter. Use a large, clean, fluffy makeup brush to apply a shimmery highlighter to your forehead and the tops of your cheeks. Switch to a smaller brush (ie: eyeshadow), and apply more highlighter to your nose and cupid's bow. Color in your eyebrows to match your wig. Try to use the same shade as your wig or a touch darker. You should be able to do this with just a purple eyebrow pencil, but you may have to use purple eyeshadow as well. Apply your eyeshadow using lots of gray tones. Apply medium-gray eyeshadow to your crease and outer corners. Darken it using a smaller brush and a darker gray or purple. Add a light gray color to your lid. Finish off with a dab of light, shimmery eyeshadow in the center of the lid, the inner corners of your eyes, and the brow bone. White, light gray, or light purple will all work for the shimmer. Apply some eyeliner to your upper lid and water line. Use black eyeliner on your upper lid, and white eye liner on the water line. If you are skilled enough, you can even add a slight cat eye to your upper lid to make your eyes appear larger. Finish off your eyes with mascara and false lashes. Apply a coat of mascara first, then add the false lashes. Let the lashes dry completely, them seal everything in with a final coating of mascara. Apply black lipstick. Outline your lips using black eyeliner or lip liner. Fill them in with black lipstick. The lipstick will likely end up looking dark gray, which is fine for Raven. Alternatively, you can leave your lower lip gray, and only color in your upper lip. Finish off with setting spray. This is very important, as it will keep your makeup from smudging or sweating off. If you can't find any setting spray, use setting powder instead. Apply it liberally to your face, wait about 30 to 45 seconds for it to set, then dust the excess off. It may look pale at first, but it will return to its normal shade after a few minutes. Remember to seal the makeup on your ears and neck as well! Apply the face gem. Find or make a red diamond. Place it against your forehead, then lightly trace it. Set the gem aside, then remove the makeup inside the outline with makeup remover. Apply spirit gum to both your forehead and the back of the gem. Let the spirit gum get tacky, then press the gem into place. Make sure that you are only applying the spirit gum to the area within the outline. Apply your wig. Find a straight, purple wig that comes down to the tops of your shoulders. Pull it on over your head, then secure it with bobby pins. If you are applying a lace-front wig, be sure to wipe off the makeup under the wig hair first. A wig with a widow's peak would work the best, but you can use one with a regular hairline instead. If you can't find the right wig, get a longer, straight wig, then cut it into an angled bob, with the longer part in front. If the wig is curly, you'll need to straighten it using the hot water technique.",
