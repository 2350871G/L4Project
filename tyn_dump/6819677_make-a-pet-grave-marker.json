Print out the design. If it's bigger than a single page, you'll need to print it across several pages and tape it together. Then, wipe the tile clean with glass cleaner or alcohol. To create a stencil on the tile, apply contact paper to the tile, working from one edge to the other to stick it down. Place the design on top of the paper and tape one edge down.
