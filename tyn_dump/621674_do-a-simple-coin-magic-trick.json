        "Rub for a few seconds, telling your audience that something strange is happening.",
        "The quarter isn't changing colors...the quarter is...disappearing.",
        "You can then reveal your hand to be empty.",
        "If people want to check the other hand for the quarter, you can drop it down your collar before showing them that that hand is also empty.",
        "Make the quarter reappear.",
        "The trick can end at the last step, or you can magically make the quarter reappear.",
        "You can do this any number of ways, from scratching your head with your non-dominant hand, acting as if it appears from underneath your hair, \"taking it\" from someone else's clothes, or simply \"coughing\" it up.",
        "Whatever you fancy.",
        "If you want to be clever about it, wait a while until people have forgotten about the trick.",
        "Then mysteriously the quarter reappears.",
        "Oh, so that's where it went.",
        "Huh.",
        "You had no idea.",
        "Funny, that.",
        "The Psychic Coin Trick Find a coin that's not identical on both sides.",
        "A 10p coin is a good example of this.",
        "If you're not sure if any of your country's currency has qualifying coinage, sit down and study them.",
        "You may find one has thicker ridges on one side, or identifiable engraving.",
        "Make sure you can identify the sides with your eyes closed.",
        "You may be able to get away with making a scratch on one side, but if the other person sees it, they may wind up suspicious and figure out your trick.",
        "It's better to use a coin with no obvious damage.",
        "Practice doing coin flips and predicting which side it lands on.",
        "Now that you know what each side feels like, you'll be able to predict how it lands when you do a coin flip.",
        "It's all in the manner of catching it and turning it over in your hands.",
        "You just have to make sure the coin goes across your fingertips before you make the \"prediction.\"",
        "Take some time to practice flipping it, sensing what side it's on, and exposing it in one swift, natural movement.",
        "That second you take to assess the coin shouldn't be visible to an unsuspecting audience.",
        "Find a friend and take turns \"guessing\" how the coin will land.",
        "Let them toss it around a few times, showing them that it's not a special or trick coin.",
        "Then, ask them to guess which side it'll land on as you flip it.",
        "Throw the coin up and catch it, but don't put it on your wrist yet.",
        "Just before you put it on your wrist, do it slower than usual \u2013 feel the indentation on the side facing down (which you are currently able to feel with your thumb and nothing else as it's facing upwards if you opened you palm).",
        "You are able to manipulate the coin in your hand to land on the side you want.",
        "So call it 5 minutes beforehand, 10 seconds beforehand, or right as you turn it over \u2013 and you'll always be right.",
        "Manipulate the coin in your hand.",
        "Before you put it on your wrist, turn it to the side you want it to be and place it in such a way that it will be exposed facing the direction you guessed.",
        "You'll have to be quick, practice makes perfect.",
        "After you flip the coin (or evaluate that you don't have to) you know it's the side you wanted it to be and place it.",
        "That's it.",
        "The beauty of this trick is that you can do it over and over and over \u2013 unlike many other tricks that require anonymous set-up.",
        "However, you can't do it when someone else does it.",
        "Tell them that you need to get a good read on the coin and you can only do this when you have physical contact with the coin.",
        "The Empty Cloth Trick Get something cloth-like, a penny, and a piece of double-sided tape.",
        "In private, put a piece of double-sided tape on one corner of your cloth.",
        "Make sure the penny will stick onto it.",
        "For the cloth, you can use a piece of paper, a rag, or a paper towel.",
        "It doesn't have to be a penny, but the penny is a good, average size.",
        "The smaller the piece of tape, the better (it'll be less obvious should you not be skilled in sleight of hand) \u2013 however, you risk the penny not sticking to it when the trick is in full gear.",
        "Take your cloth and show it to the audience.",
        "Keep the double-sided tape bit concealed and facing you.",
        "For all your audience knows, it's just a regular paper towel (or whatever it is you're using).",
        "Be careful putting your finger over the tape \u2013 you don't want to remove the adhesive from the tape with the oils from your fingers before the trick even begins.",
        "Stick the penny in the center of the cloth, tape side up.",
        "Show it to your audience.",
        "It's just a regular penny inside a paper towel, right?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, if you make sure your hand is blocking the piece of tape from view.",
        "The flimsier the cloth, the better.",
        "This way when you show the center of the cloth with the penny, the sides naturally fall down, away from view.",
        "Fold the corners in, starting with the taped corner.",
        "One by one, fold them all in.",
        "In this little pocket you've created, you're going to make the coin disappear.",
        "But first, ask a person in the audience to feel the coin is still there.",
        "It will be, arousing no suspicion.",
        "Keep the corners folded in as the person touches it.",
        "However, encourage them to touch it on both sides.",
        "As long as they don't move the cloth, your trick should go off without a hitch.",
        "Reveal the empty cloth by unfolding the corners, making sure your finger is on the penny.",
        "And then presto!",
        "Show the empty cloth, towel, or paper to your audience.",
        "Wiggle it around, holding it by the same taped corner.",
        "Where did it go?",
        "Remember: if someone asks you how you did it, just say, \"A magician never reveals his secrets!\""
