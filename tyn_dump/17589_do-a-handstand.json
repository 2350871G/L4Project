This will decrease the chance that you'll get injured. Do the following stretches to get into gear:\nRoll your wrists, ankles, and neck until they're nice and loose. Put your feet together and bend down to touch your toes. Try to keep your legs straight. Hold for 30 seconds, stand up, and repeat the stretch with your legs about a foot apart.

        "Hold your arms straight and move your head toward the ground.",
        "Move with a bit of force in a natural, forward motion over your lunged leg.",
        "This will allow for a balanced system over your lunged leg, where gravity actually aids in the handstand, rather than restricting it.",

        "The act of stepping forward, tipping over, striking the ground with your hands and lifting your legs should be one smooth, fluid motion that ends in a handstand.",
        "Keep your head tucked in,as it would be if you were standing up, and your back and legs straight.",
        "Don't throw your head back.",
        "This will only result in your handstand arching your back and hurting.",
        "This won't look as impressive, either.",

        "Rosalind Lutsky\t\t\tFormer Gymnastics Coach\t\t\t\tWhat happens if you start falling?",
        "Rosalind Lutsky, former gymnastics coach, tells us: \"If you\u2019re falling forwards, tuck your head in \u2014 touching your chin to your chest \u2014 so that you can roll out of the handstand.",
        "If you\u2019re falling backwards or sideways, try to reach your feet down and bend your knees.\"",
        "Balance your weight on your hands.",
        "Keep your weight between your palms and your first knuckles.",
        "Adjust your hands to balance your weight by moving it toward your fingers; you're more likely to lose balance if your roll it back toward your wrists.",

        "Make sure your weight is over your shoulders so that you can fall backwards.",
        "To start of with, bend your arms and tuck into a roll.",

        "Teach your body to absorb shock instead of hardening your muscles on impact.",
        "Never take too much weight onto one arm or one ankle.",
        "Make sure that you tuck your head to your chest before you roll out, as you could fall on your head a little harder than you would like.",

        "Using a Prop Find a sturdy wall or tree.",
        "In some cases it's easier to start learning a handstand against a wall or another sort of prop.",

        "You can learn to do a handstand all by yourself.",

        "Now start facing the wall.",
        "Now that you're used to being upside down and you've gotten a feel for how to do a handstand, it's time to change the way you start.",
        "Instead of gently walking yourself up the wall, you'll face the wall to start.",
        "When you learn how to do a handstand by facing the wall, you'll be able to do it anywhere, anytime.",
        "Stand facing the wall with your feet shoulder-width apart.",
