                    "description": "The first thing you\u2019ll need to do is brew 1 cup (240 mL) of chamomile tea. The tea is used to release the dye in the henna. While it is still hot, slowly pour it in a bowl of 100% pure henna powder and mix it with a fork or whisk until you get a chunky yogurt consistency. The amount of henna you use depends on your hair length and thickness. It is recommended to use 3.5 ounces (99 g) for every 6 inches (15 cm) of hair. Only use 100% pure henna and indigo powders instead of store-bought henna hair dye. These may contain harmful chemicals and are not completely natural."

Once you have finished mixing the tea and henna, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it in a warm spot for at least 8 hours. Leave it by a sunny window or under a lamp, as the warm temperature will allow the dye to release more quickly.

The more indigo powder you use, the darker the color will turn out. When you finally mix the henna and indigo together, you\u2019ll want the indigo to make up 75% of the mixture in order for your hair to be completely black. For example, if you used 3.5 ounces (99 g) of henna, use at least 7.5 ounces (210 g) of indigo powder. If you do any less, your hair color will turn out dark brown or red."
