Acetone can be used on wood that is unpainted and untreated, as it can damage varnish and paint. Place tape around the glue so the acetone does not leak onto the wood.

Peel an orange and place the peel over the glue. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes. Then, remove the orange peel and use a cloth to wipe off the glue. Sanding off Large and Stubborn Glue Spots Use 600-grit sandpaper on thick glue. Get a small piece of sandpaper, just enough to cover the glue. Sand until the glue appears flat on the wood. Use light back and forth motions, applying medium pressure to the area. Switch to 1200-grit sandpaper and remove the remaining glue. Carefully sand the remaining glue. Make sure you do not sand any of the wood, just the glue. Wipe the area with a soft cloth. Remove pieces of glue from the wood with a soft cloth.
