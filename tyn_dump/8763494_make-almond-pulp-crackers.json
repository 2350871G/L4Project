    "text": " Making Savory Crackers Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).  Place the almond pulp into a large mixing bowl. When you make a batch of almond milk, you will usually end up with about 1 cup (225 grams) of wet almond pulp. What you have leftover is just enough for this recipe. Add the oil, ground flax or chia seeds, salt, herbs, and minced garlic. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon. You don't have to add the garlic, but it will lend the crackers a nice flavor. If you don't have any fresh herbs, use 2 teaspoons of dried herbs instead. Great herbs to use include: chives, parsley, and rosemary. You can use just one type, or you can mix-and-match. Add some water, if needed. Your pulp might be wet enough to mold. If it feels too dry, stir in some water, 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) at a time. Keep adding water until you can press the dough between your fingers. Roll the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper. Cover your work surface with a sheet of parchment paper.

You can make as many or as few holes as you want. One prick of a fork for each cracker will be enough, however. Bake the crackers for 20 minutes. Use the parchment paper to transfer the crackers onto a large baking sheet. Place the baking sheet into the oven. Let the crackers bake for 20 minutes. Flip the crackers over and bake them for 15 to 20 more minutes. Gently break apart the crackers first. Use a spatula to flip them over. Place them back into the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes. They are ready when they turn golden and crispy. Let the crackers cool before you serve them. If you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge in an airtight container. Making Sweet Crackers Mix together the dry ingredients. Place the almond pulp into a large mixing bowl. Add the rice flour, ground cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Stir everything together, making sure to break up any large chunks. You can try using ground flax seed or chia seeds instead of rice flour. Add in the butter and honey. Continue stirring the mixture until it starts to come together. Don't worry if it looks a little crumbly at this point. If you are vegan, you can use olive oil, coconut oil, or even vegan/dairy-free butter. If you are vegan, try agave nectar or maple syrup instead of honey. Stir in some water, if needed. If the mixture is still too dry, stir in some water, 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) at a time until it starts to stick together. Form the dough into a disk on a sheet of parchment paper. Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Set the dough on top, and form it into a disk using your hands. Use a rubber spatula to scrape everything out of the bowl, if needed. Cover and refrigerate the dough for 20 to 30 minutes. Loosely wrap the parchment paper around the dough, and secure it with a piece of tape, if needed.
