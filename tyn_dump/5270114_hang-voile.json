                    "description": "Place your brackets at least 2 in (5.1 cm) above the top of your window, and 6 in (15 cm) out from each side. Make sure the brackets are level so your curtain rod runs horizontally. Use a drill with a screwdriver attachment to secure the brackets in place. Once they\u2019re installed, set the curtain rod on top of the bracket. If you can\u2019t drill into your walls, you can also use adhesive-backed hooks to hold the curtain rod. Put them in the same position as you would the brackets and allow them to set on the wall for at least 1 hour. If you have a recessed window, you can also use a tension rod inside of the window well. Twist the tension rod until it\u2019s \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wider than the window. Use a double curtain rod if you want to hang voile behind a different type of curtain. That way, you can close a thicker curtain over the voile to get more privacy.Tip: If you want to make your ceilings look like they\u2019re taller, hang your curtain rods closer to the ceiling instead of just above the window."
