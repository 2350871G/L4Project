    "text": " Preparing the Tempura Prepare the shrimp. Remove the vein from the shrimp, and use a knife to cut some slits in the underside of the shrimp to prevent them from curling up while cooking. If the shrimp still has its shell on, start peeling it at the third joint. This will make the task easier. Combine an egg yolk with 1 cup (240 ml) cold water.  Add 1 cup (240 ml) flour to the egg mixture. Mix them together, but not too much. There should still be lumps left in the batter. Coat the shrimp in flour. Rolling it with your hands or chopsticks will fully coat it. Dip the shrimp in the tempura batter. Completely cover the shrimp with the batter. Heat up oil to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Use a pan or a deep-fryer to heat up any type of cooking oil, such as sesame oil or canola oil. Make sure you have enough oil to submerge the shrimp. Don't fry your tempura in olive oil - this will affect the flavor. Fry the shrimp. Put the shrimp into the oil and allow it to deep-fry. Initially, the oil will bubble quite a bit after the shrimp is put in; when the bubbles get smaller, take the shrimp out and set it aside. Take care not to leave it in for too long, as the shrimp will still cook for a short time after being removed from the oil. Making the Tempura Roll Cook the rice in water. After it's fully cooked, set it aside to cool. While the rice is cooling, heat up the rice vinegar, salt, and sugar in a pot and mix them together. Then gradually toss the rice vinegar mixture into the rice, tasting it periodically to make sure you're not using too much or too little. Prepare any other fillings you'll be using. Wash, cook, and/or peel any other ingredients you're using in the shrimp, and then cut them into strips, if necessary. Cover your sushi mat with plastic wrap and set the nori on top of it. The plastic wrap will keep rice grains and other prone-to-falling ingredients from getting stuck in the sushi mat. If you don't have a sushi mat, you can place the plastic wrap over something else, such as a clean towel. Coat the nori with rice. Make sure the rice is layered thinly and relatively evenly, and leave a small strip of nori uncovered (about \u20442 to 1 inch (13 to 25 mm)) so that the roll will close successfully. Keeping your hands wet during this process can help prevent the rice from sticking to your hands. If you're using sesame seeds, sprinkle them over the rice layer. Flip the rice-covered nori. You want the uncoated side of the nori to be exposed, with the rice facing your sushi mat. Place the tempura on the nori. Take the tempura and place it on the center of the nori, leaving the tail hanging out to prevent it from being eaten. Add other fillings to your sushi. If you're using other fillings, place them next to the tempura in their own individual lines. Common sushi fillings include crab meat, avocado, cucumber, mayonnaise, and cream cheese. Roll your sushi. Grab the sushi mat from both ends and wrap the end with rice over the inch that doesn\u2019t have any rice on it. Apply pressure to seal the roll. Cut the roll into pieces. Move the roll off of the sushi mat and place it on a cutting board. Using a wet knife, slice the roll. Serve.
