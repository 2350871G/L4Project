Press the stick down on the surface lengthwise and move it sideways to create thick, abstract lines. Hold the stick vertically near the tip and you can make thick, rounded markings. Thin lines are useful for linear objects like grass. Thick abstract lines are good for making a textured background. Big, round strokes can make cobblestones or bricks."
