Pour 100 millilitres (3.4  fl oz) of olive oil into the pan and leave it to heat and begin shimmering. For this recipe, a frying pan around 28 centimetres (11 in) in diameter will give you a perfectly thick and well-cooked tortilla. If you are using a smaller pan, you will need to give your tortilla more time to cook. If you use a bigger pan and have a thinner tortilla, it will take less time to cook all the way through. Drain this oil once you have finished using it, as it can be reused another 5 or 6 times when making Spanish tortillas again."

You can do this step while the onions and potatoes are cooking to save a little time! Eggs, potatoes, and onions are all quite bland when unseasoned, so they require a good amount of salt and pepper to bring out their natural flavors.
