Cutting corned beef early causes it to lose its juices, so leave the brisket whole with all the fat on it. At a minimum, cook the beef to 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) before cutting it. At that temperature, the beef is safe to eat, although cooking it slowly to a higher temperature makes it taste better."

                    "description": "Move the corned beef to a cutting board as soon as it\u2019s done cooking. Cover it loosely in foil to keep it warm while it rests. Waiting allows the meat to reabsorb the moisture inside of it, so you end up with a juicier brisket and a cleaner cutting board. Remove the beef from heat sources, including hot liquids, to prevent it from overcooking. This rest period is the perfect time to finish preparing vegetables or other components you plan on serving with the corned beef."

                    "description": "If you are able to, get a knife that is as long as the corned beef is wide. That way, you are able to cut the meat into whole slices instead of uneven chunks. A long meat carving knife is the best tool to have, especially for large briskets. Sharpen your knife to ensure it cuts cleanly through the beef instead of tearing it. Use a meat fork to hold the beef in place while you slice it."

Gently pull the beef apart with a meat fork to expose the fat in the middle, then slide your knife horizontally between the brisket to separate the cuts. The bigger portion is called the flat. It\u2019s leaner and has an even thickness. The fattier part, called the point, is smaller and sits on top of the flat. Flat and point portions are often packaged and sold separately, so you do not need to get a whole brisket to enjoy good corned beef."

Pin the beef in place with a meat fork, then slide the knife underneath the layer of fat. Cut horizontally along the beef to separate it from the fat. Leaving some fat, about 1 in (2.5 cm) or less, is fine. The fat adds flavor. Removing the fat before cooking the beef is possible, but the fat helps seal moisture and flavor in the meat."

They look like parallel lines along its entire length. Flat and point portions have different grain patterns, so always cut them separately. The grain is not the same as grill marks.

Long muscle fibers are strong and hard to chew. Briskets have long, tough muscle fibers because they come from a weight-bearing part of the cow. Not cutting against the grain potentially ruins good corned beef."

To cut through cleanly, move your knife back and forth, almost like you\u2019re operating a saw. By doing this, you alternate bringing the knife\u2019s tip and opposite end in contact with the meat. Push the knife downward as you cut through the meat, gently shaving it into slices. To make a big piece of beef more manageable, cut it in half. As long as you cut it vertically across the grain, reducing its size before slicing it is safe."

Continue cutting across the grain, slicing the beef into roughly equal portions until you reach its other end. Thicker cuts require more chewing but are still fine to use. Some people even prefer their beef that way. Thicker cuts also serve great in recipes such as corned beef hash."

Place it in resealable plastic bags or containers, labeling them as necessary. Alternatively, wrap the beef tightly in foil or plastic wrap to enjoy the leftovers within the next few days. To freeze beef, put it in a labeled, freezer-safe container. Freezing it will maintain its quality for up to 3 months. Spoiled corned beef looks slimy and has an unpleasant, rotten smell.
