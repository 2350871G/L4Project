You can sow the seeds outside in a bed placing them about 18\u201324 inches (46\u201361 cm) apart. However, growing sage from seed can be challenging and it can take up to two years for the plant to reach maturity. Many gardeners choose to start plants from cuttings because of this. Start with cuttings. If you tried starting fro seeds, and the plants didn't germinate properly, then try to start a plant with sage cuttings. Cut a stem off a healthy mature sage plant at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Remove the leaves at the bottom, but make sure to keep at least a couple pairs of leaves at the top. Place your sage cutting into soil and water it. Be careful not to give it too much or too little water."
