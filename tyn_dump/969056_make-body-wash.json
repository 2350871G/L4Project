        "After you have mixed your body wash, you can transfer it into smaller bottles or old body wash containers.",
        "Melt your coconut oil.",
        "Unlike most oils, coconut oil is very thick and solid.",

        "Close the container tightly and shake.",
        "Keep shaking until all of the ingredients are combined.",
        "Consider transferring your body wash into smaller containers.",

        "If your new container has a small mouth, such as a bottle, then you can place a funnel over the mouth of the small container first before pouring in the body wash.",
        "The funnel will make sure that everything goes into the new container and that nothing gets spilt or goes to waste.",
        "Consider decorating your containers.",
        "You can leave the smaller containers as they are, or you can give them a personal touch by embellishing them with labels, twine, and other decorations.",
        "You can even pour the body wash into tiny bottles and use them as party favors.",
        "Here are some decorating ideas:\nPrint out a label and stick it on the bottle or jar.",
        "Tie a piece of twine or ribbon around the jar lid.",
        "Decorate the bottle or jar with gemstones.",
        "You can glue them on using hot glue or purchase stick-on gemstones.",
        "Decorate the cork or lid.",
