This is caused by uneven wear and you will need to file or sand it down if there is a lip. If you've worn your pads down around the lip, then they might get stuck in the rim. Sand or file down the lip. If you do find that the lip is sticking out too far, file or sand it down with sandpaper so that the wheel can spin smoothly. Be very careful not to sand off so much that the brake pads won't work! You may need to remove the wheel to do this."

Place a dab of oil on each pivot point. Use a light machine oil or a special bicycle lubricant for best results. After you oil the lever pivots, they should feel snappy and quick when you pull them. Do not use lubricant on brake pads, rotors, or rims. This might ruin the pads and make it hard for you to stop your bike!"
