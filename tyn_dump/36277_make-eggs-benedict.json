Heat the Canadian bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes until it starts to brown, turning occasionally. Once ready, leave it in the skillet to keep it warm. English back bacon works as well. Toast the English muffins. Cut each English muffin in half and place them on a baking sheet, cut sides up. Butter the cut sides lightly and toast under the broiler until light brown. Bring water to a low simmer. Fill a wide nonstick skillet or shallow pan half full of water. Heat until there are a couple thin streams of bubbles, or until a thermometer reads 160\u2013180\u00baF (71\u201382\u00baC). Optionally, add 1 tsp (5mL) white vinegar to the water.

Cook for 3\u00bd minutes until the egg white is set but the yolk remains soft. Remove with a slotted spoon, allowing the egg to drain. Put it all together. Place one or two muffin halves on each plate. Lay a slice of bacon on top of each muffin half, followed by a poached egg. Spoon Hollandaise sauce generously over the eggs. Top with a dusting of paprika and an olive slice or two. Garnish the plate with parsley on the side. Variations Make vegetarian Eggs Florentine. Instead of the bacon, saut\u00e9 spinach until it wilts, then place that on top of the English muffin. You'll need about 4 cups (960mL) raw spinach for this recipe. Serve with asparagus. Steamed asparagus pairs perfectly with hollandaise sauce. Serve it on the side and drizzle the sauce over the entire plate. Sprinkle with finely chopped basil for more summer flavor. Use American bacon and tomatoes. \"Eggs Blackstone\" uses crisp, fatty American bacon (streaky bacon) instead of Canadian bacon. Pair this with a slice of raw, juicy tomato between the muffin and the bacon. Replace the meat with smoked salmon. The lemon flavor works wonders with seafood. Complement the salmon even more with a finely chopped handful of dill, mixed into the finished hollandaise sauce.",
