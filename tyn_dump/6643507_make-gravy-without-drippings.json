        "Sprinkle the flour over the contents of the pan.",
        "Cook, whisking continually, for about 5 minutes or until the roux looks golden brown.",
        "You need to cook the flour roux for at least 1 minute after the flour absorbs the remaining butter; otherwise, the gravy may retain some bitterness from the taste of raw flour.",
        "Gradually pour in the broth.",
        "Pour the broth into the seasoned roux, whisking constantly to combine.",
        "Bring the mixture to a boil while you continue whisking.",
        "You can use nearly any broth for this recipe, including beef, chicken, or turkey.",
        "To create a generic brown gravy, consider using two parts beef gravy and one part chicken gravy.",
        "Whisk in the cornstarch slurry.",
        "Once the gravy is at a boil, pour in the cornstarch slurry and whisk well.",
        "Continue simmering the gravy for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until it thickens.",
        "Note that the water and cornstarch may separate as the slurry sits, so you may need to quickly stir the slurry before mixing it into the gravy.",
        "Season the gravy.",
        "Sprinkle the gravy with black pepper, as desired, and mix to combine.",
        "Most commercial broths are fairly salty, so you probably won't need to add any extra salt.",
        "If you choose to do so anyway, add the salt in small amounts and taste the gravy in between each addition.",
        "Serve.",
        "For the best flavor and texture, serve the gravy immediately, while it's still hot.",
        "You can keep the gravy warm by setting it on the stove over very low heat, but try to use it within the next 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Cornstarch can break down when exposed to prolonged heat, and if that happens, the gravy will become thinner.",
        "Refrigerate any leftovers and reheat them on the stove prior to use.",
        "Whisk the gravy well to work out any congealed lumps."
