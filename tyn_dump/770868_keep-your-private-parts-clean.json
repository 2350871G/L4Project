Use a pair of sharp scissors, and snip away evenly to a length that suits you. Some people have taken to shaving the hair down there. If you and your partner favor this look, go for it!Soak in a bathtub for a bit to soften the hair up. It'll make it a lot easier to shave. Trim with scissors before lathering up the shaving cream and pointing sharp objects at your privates. Be careful. It's easy enough to nick yourself when shaving your face, and shaving is something you do every day! Note that when you shave, within a couple days it could get really itchy. If you're scheduled to give a big presentation to the board then, you might want to think twice, and save the shave till after the meeting.
