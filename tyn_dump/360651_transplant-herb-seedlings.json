Check for yellow or curling leaves, or any other sign of weakness. Transplant only your healthy plants. You can also check to make sure the herb seedlings have formed a ball of roots, but this can be difficult to do without removing the plant from its pot or pellet."

Good drainage is essential for many herbs, such as rosemary and sage. Try to stick to pots between 6\u201d-8\u201d for single plants and 10\u201d and up for multiples.
