If you want to use a pouring pot, cut up the gel into sizable pieces and place in the pot, on a low to medium flame. Let the gel wax melt until it takes on a thick, syrupy consistency. Using the thermometer, do not allow the gel wax to get hotter than 230 F (110 C). If you are going to use the oven, preheat it to 225 F (107 C). While your oven is warming, cut or chunk off the desired amount of gel wax. When the oven is heated, place the gel wax into the glass container and carefully set it in the oven. Let the gel wax melt in your oven for approximately one hour. Check the temperature of the gel wax periodically using your thermometer to ensure the gel wax is at the correct level of heat.Keep a constant eye on your wax. Do not let it exceed temperatures of 230 \u00b0F (110 \u00b0C)--it may burn and turn yellow, not to mention be hazardous."

If you made your own gel wax, test 1 part fragrance with 3 parts mineral oil. If it mixes in nicely, it's fine. If you bought your gel wax from a store, separate a bit and test the dye before possibly ruining the batch. Adding the color now will create a monotone candle. The color will be evenly spread throughout all the layers. Adding the color when just poured into the container will create a swirling effect. Adding the color once the gel is mostly cooled will create a ring around the top. You can also add color layer by layer, either in the pan (pour a bit, add color, pour a bit, add color), or in the container. The tone will get richer with each layer."

Have tweezers ready to adjust your embeds as necessary without burning yourself. Use sand or salt to create a beach scene. Add seashells or pebbles for dynamics. Glue salt onto sticks to create white algae. Colored sand works well, too. Petals or flowers add well to a color scheme in any room and combine easily with fragrance. However, natural embeds may require a gel coating before placed in the container of hot wax. This can be done with the same wax gel. Wax pieces of fruit or ice cubes call to mind summery drinks and sunshine. If you do buy gel wax premade, make sure it is high density if you are wishing to embed heavy objects."
