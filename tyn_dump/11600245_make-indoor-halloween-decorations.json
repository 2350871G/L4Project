Festive phrases like \u201cHappy Halloween\u201d or \u201cTrick or Treat\u201d are good choices. You can also make objects like pumpkins or bats. Decide which direction you\u2019d like to take for your garland. Remember, you can make different streams of garland. Mix it up for a festive atmosphere. Make one streamer with pumpkins, one with black cats, and another saying \u201cHappy Halloween.\u201d Get colored construction paper to match your garland theme. The specific colors you use depends on what your garland theme is. Envision the objects you\u2019re going to make, and get construction paper that matches the colors you\u2019ll need. For Halloween, orange and black are always good choices. For different characters or objects, mix up the colors. For example, purple would work for a witch\u2019s hat and stockings, while yellow would look good as a black cat\u2019s eyes. Cut out the letters to spell out festive phrases. If you want your garland to say something like \"Happy Halloween,\" then use one sheet of construction paper for each letter. Draw out each letter in block text and cut around those lines. Continue the process until you have the entire word or phrase cut out. You can also print out the letters on colored paper and cut them out. This avoids tracing out your own letters. For another idea, cut out letters in orange and glue them onto black paper, or vice versa. \u201cHappy Halloween\u201d in orange glued onto black paper would look festive. You can also make multiple garland streams with different phrases like \"Trick or Treat.\" Cut out the shapes or objects you want to use on your garland. If you prefer objects like bats instead of phrases on the garland, then follow the same process. Take a piece of construction paper and trace out the shape you want to hang on your garland in pencil.

If you don't want to draw out the shapes, then print them out on colored paper and cut along the lines. You can also use these printouts as a template to trace so your shapes are all uniform. Shapes can also mix into phrases. Placing a pumpkin between each letter of \"Trick or Treat\" on the same garland stream mixes up your decorations. Decorate the pieces more if you want to. Some solid-colored objects are okay, like bats or pumpkins. But you may want to decorate the paper a little more. If you want to make a jack-o-lantern, for example, cut out eyes, a nose, and a mouth in black paper. Then glue those pieces on the front of the pumpkin.

These are all the pieces you need to make creepy spider decorations. Both are widely available from craft stores or online. Crepe paper may come in long rolls or individual strips.
