You can use either water from out of the tap or bottled water, it doesn't matter which. Warmer water has a lower viscosity and allows ions that conduct electricity to move more freely.

The purpose of the cardboard is to suspend the pencil graphite in the water without allowing it to touch the walls of the glass.

Use the actual pencils to do this as you need to snugly fit the pencils into the holes so the pencils don't move around or slip. If the graphite touches the walls or the base of the glass, it will interrupt the experiment. Conducting Your Experiment Connect one end of each alligator clip to the terminals of the battery. The battery is what actually produces the electrical current and so the alligator clips provide the pathway for transporting that current to the water.
