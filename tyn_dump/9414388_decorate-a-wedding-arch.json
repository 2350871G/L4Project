Ferns lend a classic touch, but you can also use other types of greenery as well, such as leaves or eucalyptus. Try to use 2 to 3 different types of greenery for a more varied look. Add flowers to fill in the gaps and to add color. Again, hold the stem against the pole, then lash it in place with green floral wire. If you need to, trim the stems down so that they fit along the pole and don't stick out. Start with the largest flowers/bundles first, then fill the gaps in with the smaller ones. Add more greenery and flowers as desired. Work your way along the cross bar, and if desired, the poles. You do not need to cover the entire arch, however. For a unique touch, consider covering just the top left or right corner, stopping the flowers halfway along the cross bar and pole. The ratio of flowers and greenery is up to you. You can use more flowers for a classical look, or more greenery for a modern look. Re-arrange the flowers, if needed. Fake flowers and greenery have wire inside the stems. Take a look at your arch. If you notice any areas that appear flat, carefully bend the stems on the flowers and greenery to make them stand out. Try to keep a few flowers flat against the arch in order to avoid a bristling look. Getting Creative Add a backdrop with curtains or runners. Slide curtain rings onto the cross bar, then use the clips to secure narrow curtains or runners. If your curtains have a pocket along the top edge, you can simply slide the cross piece of your arch through this pocket before adding it to the poles. For a more romantic touch, use sheet curtains or tulle instead. A solid color will be easier to coordinate, but you can also use a neutral pattern as well, such as thick black-and-white stripes. If you can't find ready-made curtains, consider making your own!

Her team has planned beautiful, detailed weddings, as well as social and corporate events for over 10 years, taking care of details such as floral design, d\u00e9cor, staffing, and catering. Carole Grogan\t\t\tOwner, Bright Blue Events\t\t\t\tDon't be afraid to add unique touches to your arch. Event producer and designer Carole Grogan says: \"If you want to add something creative to your arch, drape it with long fringe, hang dream catchers from it, or hang a backdrop behind it that's decorated with art or calligraphy.\" Add battery-operated lights for a magical touch. Wrap the string of lights around the pole. Use floral wire or cable ties to secure the lights, then disguise the wire/ties with flowers or greenery. Keep the pack hidden with flowers or greenery. You can get wires with standard Christmas-tree sized bulbs, or you can get thin wires with mini bulbs. Add another string of lights along the cross piece for extra sparkle. If you will be using real flowers, make sure that you get outdoor lights that are resistant to getting wet. Cover the sand, rocks, or cement in the buckets anchoring your arch. Unless the sand or rocks suit your wedding's theme, it would be a good idea to cover them up. Glass vase filler or pretty rocks would suit most themes. Moss or flowers would work great for a forest themed wedding. Cover the buckets at the base of your arch with paint or fabric. If a metal bucket doesn't fit your wedding's aesthetic, you can dress it up. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nCoat the buckets with spray paint to match your color scheme. Wrap a wide ribbon around the middle of the bucket, then tie it into a bow. Wrap the buckets with burlap fabric for a rustic look. Make a flower garland to wrap around the poles. Thread a long piece of string through an upholstery needle. Use the needle to thread real or fake flowers onto the string, leaving about 4 inches (10 cm) between each flower. Tie a loop into each end of the string, then drape or wrap the garland around your arch. Slip the loops over nails to keep the garland secure. Make sure that you pull fake flowers off of their stems first. Cut real flowers off just below the bloom. Alternatively, you can make shorter garlands, then hang them from the cross bar to create a curtain-like effect instead. Consider making a flat arch for a unique touch. Use strong packaging tape to secure the flowers to the chalkboard in an arch shape. Start from the top-center of the arch, then work your way down to the ends. Add a few more layers of flowers, making sure to cover the tape. Use chalk to write a message on the chalk board, such as the newly-weds' names. Add some greenery, such as eucalyptus, for a unique touch. You can use real or fake flowers. Consider making the arch asymmetric, where it is thicker in one area. This will give it a more organic feel.",

        "Event producer and designer Carole Grogan says: \"If you're building your own arch, keep in mind that you'll need someone who can help you set it up the day of the ceremony.",
        "However, if you have that covered, it can turn out to be really lovely.",
        "Also, if you're the first to get married in your group of friends, your friends can use the same arch when they get married, which can be a really cool and personal touch.",

        "The last thing you want on your big day is for the arch to topple over because someone bumped into it or a strong, unexpected gust of wind blew it over.",
        "If your arch did not come with some sort of anchor, you will need to buy or make one yourself.",
        "A metal bucket filled with rocks, gravel, or sand will offer you plenty of support.",
        "Place each of the arches legs into a bucket, then fill each bucket with sand, gravel, rocks, etc.",

        "Note that this is permanent and should not be done on rental arches.",
        "Working with Real Flowers Buy a variety of flowers and greenery for your arch.",
        "Where you buy the flowers and greenery from depends on your budget and preference.",
        "You can buy them wholesale, online, or a florist.",
        "Because the arch will be kept outdoors, you need to get the timing just right: obtain the flowers the day before or the day of the wedding.",
        "Cut some greenery as well.",
        "Ferns are a classic choice, but you can use other types of greenery as well, such as eucalyptus or succulents.",
        "Keep the flowers and greenery in water.",
        "Fill two buckets with water, and place the flowers in one and the greenery in the other.",
        "You can also arrange the flowers based on color, shape, or size to make it easier for you to place them on the arch later.",
        "Make sure that the water is cool, and that the buckets are in a shaded area.",
        "The buckets need to be large enough to hold your flowers comfortably.",
        "If you find yourself pushing the flowers into the bucket to get them to fit, get another bucket.",
        "Remove the lower leaves from the flowers.",
        "Make sure you keep some leaves on your flowers, to make your decoration look full and green.",
        "However, remove the leaves from the bottom 2/3 of the stem to make arranging the flowers easier.",

        "Insert your desired greenery into the blocks.",
        "Make sure that stem is firmly wedged into the block.",
        "It needs to be deep enough so that the plant is stable, but not so deep that the stem pokes out of the other side of the block.",
        "If the stem is too long, cut it.",
        "If the stem is sticking out of the block, the plant won't get any water and will wilt.",
        "Fill the gaps in with flowers.",
        "Once again, trim the stems down as needed so that they are firmly wedged in the blocks without poking out through the other side.",
        "Don't use too many flowers, however, or the arch will become too top-heavy.",
        "Start with the largest flowers first, then fill the gaps in with the smaller ones.",
        "The ratio of flowers to greenery is up to you.",
        "A more traditional arch will have more flowers than greenery, but you can use more greenery than flowers for a more unique look.",
        "Add some flowers to the base of the arch, if desired.",
        "You can use more pre-soaked oasis blocks, or you can use buckets filled with water.",
        "Alternatively, you can anchor your arch with heavy, potted flowers instead of using buckets filled with sand, gravel, or rocks.",
        "How you anchor the arch with the pots depends on the arch's design:\nIf the arch has flat, metal plates on the bottom, set the flower pots on top of the plates to weigh them down.",
        "If the arch has stakes or narrow feet, thrust them into buckets filled with soil, then transplant the flowers.",
        "Working with Fake Flowers Buy a variety of fake flowers and greenery.",
        "Choose a theme and color scheme, and stick with it.",
        "Make sure that you have large and small plants.",
        "Different textures will also help create a more unique arch.",
        "You can buy the flowers and greenery online or from an arts and crafts store.",
        "Roses and ferns are great for a classic theme, but you can use other types of flowers and greenery, such as succulents or eucalyptus.",
        "How many flowers you buy depends on how full you want your arch to be.",
        "You can cover the tops and sides of the arch, or you can cover just one corner of it.",
        "Tie the flowers into bundles, if desired.",
        "Gather 5 to 7 flowers into a bundle, then wrap green floral tape or wire around the stems to hold them together.",
        "This way, you can secure the flowers to the arch in bundles and save yourself some time and effort.",
        "If your flowers came in a spray, you can leave them attached to the main stem, or you can cut them into individual flowers with wire cutters.",
        "Use wire to attach greenery to the front of the arch.",
        "Hold the plant parallel to the cross piece.",
