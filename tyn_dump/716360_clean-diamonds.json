Start by adding a stopper to your sink to ensure that your diamonds do not fall through and end up going down the sink drain.

Remove the diamonds from the window cleaning solution, and scrub them carefully with the toothbrush. Repeat this process several times until the diamonds sparkle and shine. Be careful not to drop the diamonds or scrub too hard with the toothbrush. Make sure to get into the cracks and difficult to reach places where dirt and oil can get trapped to really clean the diamond jewelry. Use rubber gloves for this process to protect your skin from the cleaning solution and from the hot temperature of the water.
