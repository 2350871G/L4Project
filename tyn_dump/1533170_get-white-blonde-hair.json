As you begin to choose one or more hair lightening techniques, be sure to test the technique(s) on a small strip of hair before applying it to the rest of your hair.

If the strip turns orange, do not apply the bleach mix to the rest of your hair. The most common reason your hair could turn orange is that your hair is too dark to bleach completely in one sitting, so you may have to wait a couple of days and try again with the same test strand. If the strand is still orange or dark after the second bleaching, try adding a semi-permanent hair color to cover the orange INSTEAD of toning it. If you choose one shade lighter than the current strip color, you will retain a little orange, but keep the lightness. If you choose one shade darker than the current strip color, you will minimize the orange, but darken your hair a little."

After you finish, you can cover your hair with a plastic wrap if you wish. For the best results, ask someone to help you apply the mixture. If your hair is very short, it helps to part your hair in a straight line and apply the bleach starting from the root and moving all the way up the strand of hair. When finished, part the next section and do the same thing. Continue until the mixture is applied everywhere. If your hair is longer than chin-length, consider applying the bleach starting from a couple of inches away from the scalp and letting it sit for 10-15 minutes before you apply the bleach to the hair nearest the scalp. Because bleach is heat-activated, this will ensure a more even coloring. If you are a brunette, it will be more difficult to achieve an even shade of white. Be extra careful to apply a generous amount of the mixture evenly on every strand of hair."

As you wait, you are likely to experience some itching and burning sensations. This is normal. If you cannot stand the itching or burning, however, rinse it out since your discomfort could be a sign that your scalp is reacting poorly to the chemicals.
