Increase this number to 1.5 gallons (5.5 L) per person or more for children, nursing mothers, and sick people, and for anyone in a hot or high-altitude climate. Based on these numbers, try to store a 2 week supply for your household. In case of an emergency evacuation, store a 3 day supply in easily transportable containers. For example, 2 healthy adults and 1 child need (1 gallon or 3.8 liters / adult) x (2 adults) + (1.5 gal or 5.7 liters / child) x (1 child) = 3.5 gallons (13.25 liters) per day. A 2 week supply of water for this household is (3.5 gallons or 13.25 liters/ day) x (14 days) = 49 gallons (185.5 liters). A 3 day supply would be (3.5 gallons or 13.25 liters/day) x (3 days) = 10.5 gallons (40 liters)."
