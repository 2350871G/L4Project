        "One simple way to get more humidity to your plants is to place them in a naturally humid part of your home.",
        "Put your plants in the bathroom where they\u2019ll get steam from your shower or bath, or keep them above the kitchen sink so they can soak up the humidity when you wash the dishes or put the kettle on.",
        "The bathroom is an ideal location for delicate, moisture-loving plants such as ferns and orchids, especially in the winter.",
        "Just make sure your plants can still get enough light wherever you choose to place them.",
        "For example, if your bathroom doesn\u2019t have a window, you might provide an artificial grow-light.",
        "Place a humidifier in the room with your plants.",
        "If you\u2019d rather not keep your plants in the bathroom or kitchen, you can boost the moisture in any room by adding a humidifier.",
        "Try setting up a simple cool-mist vaporizer near your plants, or get a larger humidifier if you\u2019d like to humidify the whole room or home.Tip: You can make a DIY humidifier for your room and plants in the winter by setting a heat-proof dish or pan of water on top of a floor vent or radiator.",
        "The heat will cause the water to evaporate.",
        "A humidifier has the added bonus of being good for you and even your wood furniture and flooring!",
        "Keep groups of plants together so they can create moisture for each other.",
        "Plants create their own moisture, so putting a bunch of them together can help them keep each other humidified.",
        "Group your plants together, but leave enough space between them so that their leaves don\u2019t touch.",
        "They need plenty of \u201cbreathing room\u201d to prevent disease.",
        "Keep plants with similar humidity needs together.",
        "For example, you might put a moisture-loving spider plant, fern, and orchid together in your bathroom, but keep a cactus, hens-and-chicks, and aloe in a drier part of your house.",
        "Avoid placing your plants in drafty areas or near heat sources.",
        "Drafts and heat sources can dry out the air and dehydrate your plants.",
        "Don\u2019t put your plants near heater vents, radiators, or air conditioners.",
        "Keep them away from drafty spots, such as near doorways or corridors.",
        "If you have heating under your floors, keep your plants off the floor by setting them on a table or plant stand.",
        "Creating a Glass Terrarium Put your plants in an open glass bowl to keep moisture around them.",
        "Even without a lid, a glass container with tall sides will help trap humidity around your plant.",
        "Use a container such as a large glass jar, bowl, or fish tank.",
        "You can either set the plant pot inside the container or add soil and put the plants directly in the container itself.",
        "The sides of the container don\u2019t necessarily have to be as tall as the plant, but steeper sides will hold in more humidity.",
        "If you decide to plant directly in the glass container, add a little gravel to the bottom beneath the soil to improve drainage.",
        "Using a glass container for planting also makes it easier to tell by looking when your plants need to be watered.",
        "Make sure there\u2019s enough room around the plants so that their leaves don\u2019t touch the sides of the container, since this can cause decay.",
        "Cover your plant with a glass cloche or bell jar to make a mini greenhouse.",
        "If you have a delicate, moisture-loving plant, you can create a gorgeous, humidity-trapping greenhouse for it by placing a glass cover over the plant.",
        "Use a large glass cloche or upend a large jar with a wide mouth and set that over the plant and pot.",
        "Take the cover off once or twice a week to let in fresh air and prevent mold from growing.",
        "You can buy glass bell jars or cloches online, from home d\u00e9cor stores, or from home and garden supply centers.",
        "Make a garden in a bottle if you want a closed ecosystem.",
        "A garden in a glass bottle is a beautiful and low-maintenance option for growing small, moisture-loving plants.",
        "Fill a large bottle or jar with a layer of horticultural grit and a layer of slightly damp potting soil until it\u2019s about 1/3 full, then carefully insert your plants using tongs (or your hands, if the opening is wide enough).",
        "Pour in some water so it runs down the sides of the bottle and moistens the soil, then cover the opening of the container with cork stopper or glass lid.",
        "If you keep your bottle garden covered, you should only need to water it once every 4-6 months!",
        "Check the plants regularly for signs of mold or disease.",
        "If you see any problems, you\u2019ll need to remove the diseased foliage immediately and leave the container open for 3-4 weeks to let in fresh air."
