If you received an unidentified bamboo from a friend, ask bamboo-friendly nurseries or online newsgroups for help in identifying it. Bamboos have a wide variety of temperature and sun requirements.

It will make maintenance a lot easier if you put your bamboo near the edge of a stream, or in a location where water is already being handled. However, note that bamboos can not endure being kept soggy. They will not grow in swamp or other saturated areas. The ideal is to have high drainage soil with frequent watering."

            "description": "Almost all clumping bamboos will grow well in partial shade. Many of them can be severely harmed by too much direct sun. However, the largest clumping bamboos require full sun to attain their full size. The sun preference of bamboos is typically rated on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 is full shade and 5 is full sun."

However, the largest of tropical species can put up culms 15cm or more in diameter, and will need an area 2 or more meters around at maturity."
