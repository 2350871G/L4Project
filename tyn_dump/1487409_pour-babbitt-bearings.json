Open the bearing case and melt off the old bearing, making sure you melt the retaining grooves and holes, as well. Collect the melted Babbitt in a cast iron lead melting pot, available at welding supply outlets. Scrape remaining Babbitt from the bearing case, grooves and holes and add them to the pot."

You can determine which alloy is needed with the surface speed of the shaft and the load the bearing is going to be caring. Tin and Lead based Babbitts have different compositions for different loads and uses. The formula in the following reference will help you to find which Babbitt alloy is right for your bearing. Babbitt metal is usually available at sawmill supply companies, chipper companies or some hardware stores. It is also available to be ordered directly from manufactures like Kapp Alloy."

On very well-worn and old surfaces, this can be the most difficult part of the bearing refurbishment. Often, the lubricants and contaminants have worked well into the steel and old bearing Babbitt. You may find that you think the surface is clean, but on heating, more contaminants and oil surface from the steel. These contaminants can be drawn out by alternating: a. heat while scrubbing with a stainless steel brush, and b. solvent treatments. Removing these contaminants is critical to a uniform Babbitt bond. Make sure that the shaft to be supported by the bearing is smooth and clean."
