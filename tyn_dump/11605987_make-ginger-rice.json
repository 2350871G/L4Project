You can use a peeler or knife if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s pretty easy to peel ginger with the side of a spoon. You can purchase pre-skinned ginger from some grocery stores.

Slide your ginger into the broth or water by tilting the cutting board over the pan and scraping the minced ginger off with the edge of your blade. Put 1 cup (175 g) of rice into the pan. Rinse the rice before pouring it if you\u2019d like. To do this, soak the rice in water and spoon off any cloudy portions before straining the water out. Alternatively, you can put the rice grains on a strainer and run them under a steady stream of water. Most ginger rice recipes call for Basmati or jasmine rice. Basmati rice is more commonly used in Indian dishes, while jasmine rice is most commonly found in Chinese, Thai, and Japanese dishes. While these are the most commonly-used varieties for ginger rice, but you can use any type of rice that you\u2019d like. Broth will result in tastier rice but cooking the rice in water is a healthier option. It is completely up to you if you want to use broth or water."
