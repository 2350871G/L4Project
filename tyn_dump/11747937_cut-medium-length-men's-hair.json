        "Otherwise, secure a clip to the hair so it doesn\u2019t fall down on the sides while you\u2019re working.You don\u2019t need to use a hair tie or clip if you don\u2019t want to, but you may lose the visible part while you\u2019re working if the person moves their head.",
        "Comb the hair on the sides and back of the head straight down.",
        "Start from the top where you parted the hair and bring the person\u2019s hair straight down with your comb.",
        "Work completely around the person\u2019s head to straighten their hair around the back and sides.",
        "Be careful not to pull any of the hair from the top of the person\u2019s head down, or else you may need to start over.",
        "Trimming the Back and Sides Comb out a vertical section of hair on the side of the person\u2019s head.",
        "Start on one side of the person\u2019s face just in front of their ear.",
        "Comb a section that\u2019s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide forward so it\u2019s separate from the rest of the person\u2019s hair.",
        "Place the comb along the roots and pull it straight out towards the ends of the strands so they form a 90-degree angle to the person\u2019s head.Avoid working with larger sections of hair since you won\u2019t be able to cut them as easily.",
        "Pinch the hair between your index and middle fingers at the desired length.",
        "Use your nondominant hand to grip the section of hair as close to the roots as you can.",
        "Keep the back of your hand closest to the person\u2019s head and your palm facing you.",
        "Slide your fingers along the strands behind your comb, making sure the hair stays straight perpendicular to their head.",
        "When your palm reaches the length you want to cut the hair to, stop moving your fingers and squeeze them together tightly.Typically, medium-length men\u2019s hairstyles are around 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) long, but the person may want something different for their hair.",
        "Cut the hair vertically with hair-cutting shears so the ends are square.",
        "Hold your shears so the blades point face down so they\u2019re easier to work with.",
        "Snip the hair from the palm side of your hand using short downward strokes so the ends of the hairs are even and line up with one another.",
        "After you make your cut, let go of the section so it falls back toward the person\u2019s head.You can buy shears made for cutting hair online or from beauty supply stores.",
        "Trimming the ends of the person\u2019s hair so they\u2019re square creates a tapered, layered look that\u2019s lighter and easier to work with.",
        "It will also make the hair blend together more easily.Warning: Avoid using regular scissors to cut somebody\u2019s hair since you could damage the ends and it won\u2019t look as uniform.",
        "Work around the back of the head in sections until you reach the other side.",
        "Comb the next 1 in (2.5 cm) section of hair away from the person\u2019s head and grip it with your fingers at the same length as the first one.",
        "Use your shears to square off the ends of the hair before moving on.",
        "Go completely around the back of the person\u2019s head so you end in front of their other ear.If you aren\u2019t able to grab all of the hair in the vertical section, work from the top to the bottom.",
        "As you adjust your grip, hold some of the hair you already cut from that section to use as a guide so you know how long to cut the lower strands.",
        "If you\u2019d rather have a uniform length for the hair on the sides and back of your head, you can also use clippers with a guard.",
        "Work from the bottom towards the part in straight strokes, lifting the clippers away as you finish each cut.",
        "This works well if you\u2019re giving the person a fade or undercut.",
        "Check horizontal sections of hair and trim strands that are too long.",
        "Start on either side of the person\u2019s head at the part in their hair.",
        "Drag your comb through a horizontal section that\u2019s \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide and grip the strands between your fingers.",
        "If you notice any hairs that are longer than the others, use your shears to trim them straight horizontally.",
        "Work your way down and around the person\u2019s head to ensure the ends are uniform.Be careful not to cut the hair too short in sections closer to the top of the person\u2019s head since it could make it look like they have a bald spot.",
        "Trim around the ears and neckline with clippers to make a clean edge.",
        "Use clippers without a guard so you can cut as close to the skin as possible.",
        "Comb the hair on the sides of the person\u2019s head back so it goes over their ears.",
        "Carefully guide the clippers around the person\u2019s ear to create a clean line.",
        "Bend the person\u2019s ear forward to trim the hair behind it.",

        "Then, straighten out their neckline to get rid of any stray hairs.Be careful not to hit the person\u2019s ears with the clippers since it could be painful for them.",
        "You can also use your shears if you don\u2019t have any clippers.",
        "Only work with the tips of the blades so you\u2019re less likely to cut the person.",
        "Layering the Top Split the hair into a middle part so you can work in sections.",
        "Undo the hair tie or clip holding the person\u2019s hair up and straighten it out toward the person\u2019s face again.",
        "Find the middle of the person\u2019s head and separate their hair to make a part running down the center.",
        "Follow which direction the hair naturally falls on their head so you can make more accurate cuts.It\u2019s okay for the hair from the top of the person\u2019s head to overlap the hair on the sides or back.",
        "Comb out a vertical section that has hair from the top and side of the head.",
        "Start near the person\u2019s face and hold your comb vertically.",
        "Separate a vertical section that\u2019s 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide toward the person\u2019s face so it contains some of the hair you cut from the sides.",
        "Pull the hair straight out away from the person\u2019s head so you can easily see the length.The hair you already cut on the sides will act as a guide so you know how long to cut the ends on top to create a layered and tapered look.Variation: If you don\u2019t want the hair on top of the person\u2019s head to blend into the sides, like if you want the hair on top longer than the sides, comb out horizontal sections of hair starting at the part and working toward the middle of the person\u2019s head.",
        "Don\u2019t include any hair from the side of the person\u2019s head in the combed-out section.",
        "Pinch the section between your fingers at the shortest hair\u2019s length.",
        "Keep your palm facing you and grip the section of hair tightly between the index and middle finger on your nondominant hand.",
        "Make sure you can see the ends of the shortest hairs so you\u2019re able to use them as reference for how long to cut the rest.",
        "Keep the hair pulled tight, or else you may not cut them correctly.",
        "Use your shears to cut the ends square with the shortest strands.",
        "Keep the blades of your shears vertical and cut using your dominant hand.",
        "Start at the bottom of the section so the blades are perpendicular to the shortest strands of hair.",
        "Make small cuts going straight up, using the tips of your shears so you have the most control.If you want to leave the hair on top longer than the sides, you can the ends to any length.",
        "Just make sure the ends of the hair on top are square with one another instead of squaring them up to the sides.",
        "If you weren\u2019t able to cut all of the hair in the vertical section, adjust your grip toward the top of the person\u2019s head so you\u2019re still holding some of the hair you just trimmed.",
        "Be sure to keep the ends of the hair square as you work.",
        "Cutting the hair from the top of the person\u2019s head so it\u2019s square with the sides doesn\u2019t mean it will be the same length.",
        "Since the roots from the hair on top are higher up on the person\u2019s head, you won\u2019t have to trim as much off the ends, which leaves the top longer and helps it blend into the sides.",
        "Work your way around the head in sections until you reach the other side.",
        "Take the section of hair that\u2019s right next to the one you just cut and pull it straight away from the person\u2019s head.",
        "Grip the hair tightly between your fingers and continue cutting the ends so they\u2019re square with the sides.",
        "Completely finish one side of the top part before starting the other.",
        "Check the person\u2019s hair from a few steps away to make sure you cut it evenly.",
        "Comb the person\u2019s hair toward their face before taking 2\u20133 steps away from them.",
        "Check the hair on top looks symmetrical on each side to ensure that you didn\u2019t leave any long strands.",
        "If you did, comb through their hair again and trim the pieces that are still too long.Give the person a mirror and ask them if they\u2019re happy with the haircut.",
        "If they have any concerns or want something different, continue working until they like it."
