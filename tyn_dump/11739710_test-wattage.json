That said, while any meter can test the wattage of a plug-in appliance, keep factors like the following in mind:\nAccuracy. Some models claim an accuracy range of less than 0.5%, while others have ranges of 3% or more. (with a 3% range, an actual wattage of 600 might read anywhere from 582-618 W). Depending on your needs, high accuracy may or may not be of great importance. Design. Look for a functional design setup with easy-to-understand buttons and digital readouts. Some models come in 2 parts connected by a cord so that you can place the digital readout in a convenient spot\u2014such as on your desktop instead of at the outlet under your desk."

        "While the primary tools\u2014a multimeter and a clamp meter\u2014are the same when testing both AC and DC electronics, DC testing is generally easier for the average DIYer.",
        "If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to test AC (or DC) electronic devices, hire a licensed electrician to do the testing for you.",
        "Both multimeters and clamp meters (which specifically measure electrical current) are widely available at home improvement retailers.",
        "You may even be able to find a combined multimeter-clamp meter device.",
        "Secure the red and black probe leads into their same-color plugs.",
        "All multimeters come with a pair of probe leads (wires with probes at the end)\u2014one red, one black.",
        "Plug both of them into their color-coordinated and clearly marked spots on the multimeter.",
        "Turn on the multimeter at this point, if you haven\u2019t done so already.",
        "Touch each probe tip to the item's same-polarity power terminal.",
        "In other words, touch the positive (+) probe to the screw, clamp, or other connector where the positive power cable connects to the electronic device (for AC) or the battery (for DC).",
        "Do the same (at the same time) with the negative probe.",
        "With a car battery (DC power), for example, touch the red probe tip to the red, positive (+) terminal on top of the battery, and the black probe tip to the black, negative (-) terminal.",
        "For an AC power device like a stereo or an air conditioner, you must be able to properly identify the positive and negative power cables and their terminals.",
        "If you\u2019re not sure you can do that, do not attempt to touch the probes to the wiring.",
        "A DC device can be on or off when you do this test.",
        "An AC device must be on.",
        "Write down the voltage reading displayed on the multimeter.",
        "You should get a nearly instantaneous voltage reading with little to no fluctuation.",
        "After you record the reading, pull the probes away from the device and set the multimeter aside.",
        "When testing a DC battery as the power source, the reading you get should correspond to the battery\u2019s listed voltage.",
        "For example, a car battery should give you a voltage reading at or very close to 12 V.\nFor an AC device, check the label on the product, the user\u2019s guide, or the manufacturer\u2019s website for the listed voltage.",
        "If your readout does not closely correspond to the listed voltage, there is most likely a problem with the device you\u2019re testing (AC or DC) or its battery (DC).",
        "Place the clamp meter\u2019s clamp around the positive power cable.",
        "The clamp works like a large carabiner clip.",
        "Press in one side so that you can clip it over the power cable running from the power source to the device you\u2019re testing.",
        "If possible, center the clamp around the cable so that the cable isn\u2019t touching the clamp.",
        "For a car (DC power), clamp around the cable running from the red (+) terminal on the battery.",
        "For an air conditioner (DC power), clamp around only the positive power cable running into the device.",
        "It\u2019s not dangerous to clamp around the wrong cable, but you won\u2019t get an accurate reading.",
        "Turn on the clamp meter and the device you\u2019re testing.",
        "The clamp meter probably turns on with a simple switch or button.",
        "If the item you\u2019re testing isn\u2019t already drawing power, turn it on now.",
        "If you\u2019re testing a car, you have 2 options, both of which you can test with the clamp meter.",
        "You can turn the key halfway in order to draw power from the battery without starting the engine, or turn the key the whole way to start the engine.",
        "The amperage readings you get may vary in these 2 situations.",
        "Write down the amp measurement on the clamp meter\u2019s display.",
        "It may take around 5 seconds for the reading to appear.",
        "Once you\u2019ve jotted down the reading, remove the clamp meter and set it aside.",
        "If you\u2019re testing your car, for example, you might get an amp reading of 5 A while the vehicle is running.",
        "Multiply the volt (V) and amp (A) measurements to get watts (W).",
        "Remember that power (measured in watts) is the product of voltage (volts) and current (amperes).",
        "This means that some quick multiplication gives you a wattage reading for the device you\u2019re testing.",
        "For example, if your car tests gave you readings of 12 V and 5 A, your wattage test result would be 60 W (12 x 5 = 60)."
