        "Keep the bottom of the chisel in contact with the wood as you move.",
        "When paring, push the paring chisel into the wood while the wood lies flat on a surface.",
        "This will keep your cuts smooth and level.Tip: When you pare, you are not taking off large amounts of wood, so you can cut with or against the wood's grain.",
        "Repeat the cuts slowly until you have removed enough wood.",
        "Paring is a controlled and slow process when done right.",
        "Take your time, remove thin slices of wood with each stroke, and aim for a very smooth surface when you are done.",
        "If you find that your blade gets dull, sharpen it as needed.",
        "Gouge or Carving Chisel Use a gouge for fine woodwork, such as carving or sculpting.",
        "Gouges can be used to carve into wood or to remove wood around a design to bring the design into relief.",
        "Gouges have curved points and long handles, but they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.",
        "Pick a couple that will work for your project.",
        "There are 8 standards of degrees to the curves of gouge chisels.",
        "These vary from a very slight curve to a chisel tip the is a half circle.",
        "Each curve also comes in a variety of widths, so you will have a wide variety of chisels to choose from.Tip: Gouge chisels are also often used when shaping wood on a lathe.",
        "Firmly attach your wood to a solid surface.",
        "Use clamps or a vise to hold it to a strong work surface, such as a workbench.",
        "Using gouges can create a lot of force, so make sure that the wood is really secure when pushed from a variety of directions.",
        "Hold the gouge with both hands and push it though the wood.",
        "Place the forefinger of your less dominant hand near the sharp end of the chisel and the rest of the hand at the place where the metal blade meets the handle.",
        "This will give you control over where the tip moves as you push it.",
        "Your other hand should be back on the handle, so that you can use its strength to push through the wood.",
        "As you push with your dominant hand, direct the tool with your less dominant hand.",
        "It will take practice to master how to move the chisel to get the effect you want.",
        "Push the gouge with the grain of the wood or across the end grain.",
        "Moving the gouge across the grain risks damaging the wood and chipping out areas that you don\u2019t want removed.",
        "As you practice and become more skilled with the gouge, the way you should move the tool across the wood will become more natural.",
        "To identify the grain, look closely at the wood.",
        "Look for lines going across the wood.",
        "These are the grain lines and you should move the gouge with them or across the very end of them.",
        "Raise, lower, or turn the handle to achieve the desired effect.",
        "Gouges are versatile chisels that can make a wide variety of cuts.",
        "Play with your gouges to make patterns and remove wood in any shape you like.",
        "For deep cuts, you can even hold the gouge perpendicular to the wood and hit the handle sharply with a mallet.",
        "Repeat your action, change the size of your gouge as needed for the design, and sharpen blades as required until your project is complete.",
        "Masonry Chisel Pick the right masonry chisel to score, trim, or shape brick or stone.",
        "Masonry chisels come in many shapes, including bolster, pitcher, and sculpting chisels.",
        "Pick one that is the right width and shape for your job, and is made to chisel the material you are shaping.",
        "A bolster chisel is beveled on one-side of the blade and is used to break off large pieces or sections.",
        "A pitcher chisel is beveled on both sides of the blade and is used to cut straight lines.",
        "Sculpting or engraving stone requires a wide variety of specialized tools and chisels.Tip: Masonry blades are typically duller, broader, and shorter than those of wood chisels, as they are meant to work by force rather than by finesse.",
        "Mark the stone clearly with paver's chalk or a dark pencil.",
        "Making a line where you want to break the stone or brick will help you keep on track as you chisel.",
        "You will make scoring marks along this line before trying to break the brick or stone in half.",
        "However, chiseling into stone and brick is not always exact, so be prepared to work with pieces that don\u2019t break right on the line.",
        "Set the masonry chisel perpendicular to the surface you are chiseling.",
        "You want to hold the chisel so that it is at 90 degrees and will go straight into the brick or stone.",
        "If you hold it at an angle, the cut will go off at an angle as well.",
        "It can take some practice to be able to hold the chisel perfectly upright while hammering it.",
        "Try making some practice cuts before chiseling into pieces that need to be cut correctly.",
        "Make a score line along the brick or stone.",
        "Gently tap the end of the chisel with a hammer, mallet, or sledgehammer along the line you want to cut away.",
        "After you score one part of the line, move the chisel down the line and continue scoring the entire length.",
        "The score line doesn't need to be very deep.",
        "You are just aiming to make the line weaker than the surrounding material, so that the stone naturally wants to break there.",
        "The goal here is to make a line that the stone or brick will break cleanly along.",
        "If you don\u2019t make a score line, a piece of brick or stone wider than your chisel can break jaggedly.",
        "Make a hard strike in the middle of your score line.",
        "Strike the handle of the chisel sharply with your hammer, mallet, or sledgehammer.",
        "Use as much force as you can, so that the chisel is driven down into the stone or brick.",
        "Repeat your strikes all along the score line on either side of the first strike until the break occurs."
