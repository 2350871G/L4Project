Also measure the edges and corners, as these require different stones than the flat surface. The majority of the area will be covered in flat stones. You may also want corner stones or edge stones. Flat stones are cut smooth on both ends to fit tightly together. Edge stones have a rough edge on one side for placement where they\u2019ll be seen on the end of a wall. Airstone is sold in eight square foot packs of flat stones, six linear foot packs of corner stones, and seven and one half square foot packs of edge stones."
