Make sure the incense sticks can fit into the dish. If the incense sticks are slightly too long for the dish, use scissors to trim down the bamboo end of each stick. A shallow, plastic dish is ideal. The shorter the incense sticks are, the more quickly they will burn. It's important to use specialty incense sticks rather than just plain bamboo sticks. Ordinary bamboo sticks will not work.

If you don't use DPG, there will be a strong burning smell when you light the incense. You can use any fragrance or essential oil that you like or a combination of several different oils. Sandalwood is a popular choice for incense sticks. Place 10 incense sticks into the dish. Make sure that the incense sticks are fully submerged in the DPG and oil mixture.

Tightly wrap the dish with plastic wrap so that that the liquid doesn't evaporate. Leave the dish in a cool, dark place. The sticks will infuse with the incense over the next day.

If the incense stick doesn't burn or smolder well, this may be because it is still slightly damp. Let the other incense sticks dry for a longer period of time. Making Incense Bundles Make a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick bouquet of flowers and herbs. Choose fresh flowers and herbs that you enjoy the scent of or pick a more traditional combination of lavender, rose, thyme, eucalyptus, and rosemary. Make sure that all of the plants are facing the same direction, with stems at one end and leaves or flowers at the opposite end. Try to choose flowers and herbs that dry well and that haven't been grown with pesticides or chemicals. You can also include cuttings from cedar or pine trees. Use cotton twine to hold the bouquet or flowers and herbs together. Use a ruler and scissors to measure and cut a piece of cotton twine that is approximately 4 in (10 cm) long. Knot the twine tightly around the middle of the bouquet to hold it together. Wrap the bouquet in 8-10 fresh sage leaves. Hold the bouquet of flowers and herbs in one hand and use your other hand to line up the sage leaves around the bouquet. Make sure that the outside of the bouquet is fully covered by the sage leaves. Use more or fewer sage leaves as required. Sage is the most traditional and popular ingredient to use in an incense bundle. However, if you do not have sage, it's fine to make your incense bundle without it. Tie the bundle together using cotton twine. Cut and measure a piece of cotton twine that is approximately 8 times as long as the bundle you have made. Use the twine to tie a knot \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the bottom of the stems. Make one end of the knotted twine only 2 in (5.1 cm) long, while the other end is the remainder. Wrap the twine around the bundle of flowers and herbs. Use the long end of the twine to wrap around the bundle. Wrap the twine as tightly, as the herbs and flowers will shrink slightly as they dry. Once you reach the other end of the bundle, wind the twine back down the bundle in the opposite direction. This will create a criss-cross formation with the twine. Tie off the twine at the end of the bundle. Once you have wrapped the whole bundle, wrap the remaining twine around the stems at the end of the bundle. Tuck in any loose ends under the wrapped twine. The wrapped twine at the end of the bundle creates a handle that you can hold as the incense burns. Let the incense bundle dry for 2-3 weeks. Hang the incense bundle in a cool, dry, and dark location. Make sure that the incense bundle is completely dry before you burn it. The amount of time that it will take for the bundle to dry depends on the humidity. Light the end of the bundle to burn the incense. Hold the bundle by the twine handle. Set the opposite end of the bundle alight. Blow out the flames and place the bundle into a heatproof dish. The smoldering bundle will release the aroma of the incense. It is easiest to hold the bundle horizontally rather than vertically as you are lighting it. To put the incense out, simply snuff it on the heatproof dish. If you use water to stop the incense burning, it will be very difficult to light again. Making Loose Incense Measure out 1 tsp each of lavender flowers, rosemary, thyme, sage, and peppermint. Lay all of your flowers and herbs out in front of you. Use a measuring spoon to determine the amount of each ingredient. You don't need to cut the ingredients, as they will be ground up soon. Make sure that all of your ingredients are fresh. You can use either white sage or garden sage. Grind the ingredients into a fine powder. Place all of the ingredients into a mortar. Use the pestle to grind and crush the flowers and herbs. Continue grinding the ingredients until there are no large fragments left. Alternatively, you can use an electric grinder rather than a mortar and pestle. Mix red sandalwood powder and essential oils into the ingredients. Place 1 tsp of red sandalwood powder and 3-4 drops of essential oils directly into the mortar and use the pestle to combine them with the other ingredients. Use any combination of lavender, rosemary, thyme, sage, or peppermint essential oils.

Store the incense in a cool, dark, place. Place the incense into an airtight, glass container. Keep the container out of the sun and open it only when you want to use the incense. This will help to preserve the scent and color of your incense. Burn the incense on a charcoal disk in a heatproof dish. Spread a thin layer of sand on the bottom of the heatproof dish. Then place the charcoal disk on top of the sand. Light the charcoal disk, place a small sprinkle of the loose incense on top of the disk, and enjoy the aroma of your own homemade, loose incense. Alternatively, use a small cauldron rather than a heatproof dish. You can also use salt rather than sand to layer the heatproof dish or cauldron.",
