                    "description": "Grab a pen, paper, and a measuring tape, and take a walk around your home. Identify any pipes that you want to cover. Measure the length of each exposed pipe that you want to insulate and write it down. For each pipe, note the diameter next to the length.Tip: This process is best completed when it\u2019s still warm out. If your pipes are already cold when you insulate them, the insulation will take a long time to warm the pipe up. If your house is on risers, get a disposable crawl suit and a flashlight to crawl into your crawlspace and look at your pipes. You can tell if a pipe has water in it by putting your ear up to it and listening carefully. You should be able to hear water rushing through it. You can also tap it with a screwdriver. If the sound is hollow, it probably doesn\u2019t have water inside. You don\u2019t really need to insulate pipes that contain wires, but you can if you\u2019d like. Pipes that contain wires are typically silver and made of metal. Copper, PVC, or cast iron pipes are more likely to carry water."

                    "description": "Take your list of measurements to your local construction or home repair store. Buy enough pipe insulation to cover all of your pipes by matching the inside diameter of the insulation to the outside diameter of your pipes. The length and interior diameter of a piece of insulation is listed on the packaging, so read the label carefully before buying your insulation. For example, if you have 2 pipes with identical diameters that measure 12 inches (30 cm) and 40 inches (100 cm), you need at least 52 inches (130 cm) of insulation. It\u2019s always a good idea to have some extra insulation on hand, though! Polyethylene looks like a black foam and is the most commonly-used material to insulate exterior pipes. Fiberglass sleeves are typically used to insulate interior pipes. If you\u2019re using fiberglass sleeves, wear a dust mask, gloves, and protective eyewear. Pipe insulation is precut so that it can wrap around the pipe easily. You can cut it to length with scissors if needed."

Wrap duct tape around the base of the insulation 4-5 times and pull it tight to keep the insulation in place. Attach cable ties by wrapping the plastic tie around the pipe and threading one end of the tie through the opening on the other end. Secure the tie by pulling firmly on the length that slides through the opening. Work your way up and wrap duct tape or place a cable tie once every 2\u20134 feet (61\u2013122 cm). Repeat this process for every pipe. Don\u2019t pull so hard on your pipe that you end up ripping it out or cracking it.
