If everything is right in your chime, then you may need to change the transformer. Installing a New Transformer for a Wired Doorbell Turn off the power to your doorbell. Disconnect the circuit leading to your doorbell by turning off the switch in your breaker box. Never start work until you\u2019ve ensured that there\u2019s no power running through the wires. Disconnect the wires from the front terminal. The transformer is usually located in your basement or attic attached to a metal electrical box. The terminal is located on the front of the transformer and has 2 screws with wires leading to your doorbell. Use a screwdriver to loosen the screws attached to those wires. Unwrap the wires from the screws and set them aside. You don\u2019t need to label the terminal wires since it doesn\u2019t matter which screw they\u2019re attached to. Undo the wires coming from the back of the transformer to remove it. The wires in the back of your transformer lead to your home\u2019s power supply. Untwist the wire caps to separate the transformer\u2019s wires from the power supply wires. Make sure your power is completely disconnected to your transformer since the back wires could shock you. Unscrew the old transformer and put the new one in its place. Use a screwdriver to take out the screws holding the transformer to the box. Once you take the screws out, take your old transformer with you to a hardware store so you can buy one that matches it. Once you get your new transformer, screw it transformer into the box where the old one used to be. Connect the matching wires on the back of the new transformer. The back of your transformer will have 3 wires that connect to your power supply. The black wire provides power, the white wire is neutral, and the green wire is a ground. Twist a wire cap on the ends of the of the wires that match in color. Make sure the power running to your transformer is off while you\u2019re wiring it. Attach the wires to the front terminal. It doesn\u2019t matter which wire you attach to which screw. Bend a hook shape into the exposed end of each wire. Slide the hook underneath the terminal head and tighten the screw with your screwdriver. Make sure the screws fully contact the wires. Don\u2019t attach both wires to a single screw. Turn on the power to test your doorbell. Turn on your breaker so your doorbell has power again. Try pressing the button and listening for the chime. If the doorbell doesn\u2019t work, double check the terminal connections and wiring in the back of the transformer. If everything looks correct in your transformer, call an electrician to look at the wiring in your walls. Troubleshooting a Wireless Doorbell Check the batteries in the button and the receiver when the bell stops working. Most times when a wireless doorbell stops working, it\u2019s because the batteries have died. Open the button and receiver to see what batteries they use. Put in new batteries and test the doorbell again to see if it works. The button and receiver may each take different styles of batteries. Use rechargeable batteries so you don\u2019t have to throw them away every time. Try moving the receiver closer to the button if the bell doesn\u2019t ring when it\u2019s pressed. Sometimes, the receiver may have trouble because it\u2019s out of range from the button. If your bell rings sometimes but not other times, try moving the receiver closer to the button if you can. Once the receiver is closer, try ringing the bell again. This will require you to remount your receiver on the wall. Switch the transmission frequency if your doorbell goes off randomly. Some wireless doorbell receivers may pick up random frequencies in the air or from nearby transmitters. This could cause the doorbell to go off at random times even when there\u2019s no one at the door. Check the doorbell\u2019s user manual to see if you can change the frequency of the receiver and button. Once the frequency is changed, try the doorbell again.
