Worms take roughly 2 months to lay cocoons and hatch infantile worms. The new worms won\u2019t grow to their mature size for at least another month after they\u2019ve hatched. If you don\u2019t see more worms than you normally do when you go to feed them, the infantile worms are likely not grown yet. Check them again in a month. Harvesting the worms allows you to thin their population out, which will keep them happy and healthy. It will also encourage the worms to continue breeding."

Worms are nocturnal and will actively avoid sunlight. To keep your worms happy and healthy, keep them in low-light conditions as often as you can. It\u2019s okay to turn the light on when going to inspect their habitat, and you won\u2019t harm them if they get a few minutes of light, but they may start dying if you leave them under a light for more than 6-7 hours. If you store your worms outside, put them under a canopy or overhang to keep them in the shade for most of the day. Maintain a temperature of 60\u201380 \u00b0F (16\u201327 \u00b0C) to promote breeding. Worms do no not do well in the cold, and will die if they\u2019re exposed to low temperatures. To keep the worms content and promote reproduction, keep the temperature in the room between 60\u201380 \u00b0F (16\u201327 \u00b0C). Either keep your heating turned on, or store them somewhere that\u2019s consistently warm. If you can\u2019t bring the worms inside in the winter and it gets cold where you live, get a heat lamp and wire cage. Set the habitat inside of the wire cage and set the heat lamp on top to keep the worms warm. Harvesting Your Worms Harvest your worms after 3-6 months of feeding. After you\u2019ve consistently fed the worms every week for 3-6 months, they\u2019ll have had enough time to reproduce and grow. Harvesting the worms involves replacing the soil and creating a new habitat for your excess worms. If you harvest your worms before 3 months have passed, you\u2019ll be removing worms before the infant worms have had time to mature. Worms take roughly 2 months to lay cocoons and hatch infantile worms. The new worms won\u2019t grow to their mature size for at least another month after they\u2019ve hatched. If you don\u2019t see more worms than you normally do when you go to feed them, the infantile worms are likely not grown yet. Check them again in a month. Harvesting the worms allows you to thin their population out, which will keep them happy and healthy. It will also encourage the worms to continue breeding. Prepare a second habitat for the expanded population of worms. If you\u2019re not going fishing with your worms and want to expand your population, you\u2019ll need a second habitat to store your worms. If your worm population has grown, it\u2019s a sign that your habitat was well-made. Create a second habitat that is identical to the first. Add your soil and a layer of compost 6 inches (15 cm) below the surface.Tip: If your bins ever get extremely overpopulated and you don\u2019t want or need the excess worms, you can always put some of them outside in the soil. The worms will burrow and find a new habitat on their own. Stop adding food 2 weeks before you want to harvest. Stop your feeding cycle 2 weeks before you want to harvest your worms. This will encourage the worms to come to the upper layers of the soil, which will make it easier for you to harvest them. Scoop the top layer of soil into a separate container. Get a separate container roughly 1/2 the size of the habitat. This should be a plastic or rubber bin with no holes at the bottom. Set it up next to your worm habitat. Turn a bright light on, and gently scoop the soil into the bin with a hand scooper. Continue scooping soil until you\u2019ve filled the rubber or plastic bin with the top half of your soil. Scoop up the compost layer along with the soil. With the light on, your worms will start to burrow into the deeper layers of the soil. You\u2019ll scoop out roughly half of the worms that don\u2019t make it all the way to the bottom half of the soil when you turn the light on. If your collection is really large, you can use a shovel instead of a scooper. Remove layers from your new bin in 10-minute increments. Leave the light on and set your new bin under it for 10 minutes to give the worms time to burrow deeper into the soil. After 10 minutes, use your scooper to remove the top 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of your soil. Then, wait another 10 minutes and repeat this process. Continue doing this until almost all of the soil is removed. Discard the excess soil or use it in your yard as fertilizer. Do this outside if you want to minimize the mess that you\u2019re going to make. It takes the worms quite a bit to move down a few layers, so take your time in between scoops. Be gentler the deeper you go. Throw on some gloves and remove the last 2-3 layers by hand if you don\u2019t want to crush any worms. Add the worms you removed to their new habitat. Place some food scraps or manure in the new habitat. Then, carefully pour the worms that you removed into their new home. The worms will feed and get to work building a new bedding layer. Pick up and discard any dead worms that you find. It\u2019s natural for a few worms to die as you breed them. Move the soil in the old habitat to one side. Put on a pair of gloves. In the bin where you originally held your worms, push the soil to one side of the container. Pile the soil up as best that you can to keep the worms on one side. Feel free to use the scooper if that\u2019s easier for you. Pour fresh soil into the empty side and add some food. With roughly half of the bin empty, grab a fresh bag of soil. Pour it into the side of the bin that doesn\u2019t have any soil in it and place some food waste on top of the fresh soil. The worms will naturally start to move towards the fresh soil, since it\u2019s richer in nutrients. The food will encourage the worms to stay on that side of the habitat. Keep feeding the worms on top of the fresh soil. This will ensure that the worms make the fresher side their home. Replace the old soil after 2-3 weeks. After your worms have had some time to settle into the new soil, you\u2019ll need to remove the old soil. Use your scooper to gently remove the side with the old soil in it. There shouldn\u2019t be very many worms in there, but if there are, simply put them on top of the soil on the fresh side. Pour fresh soil into the half that you emptied to replenish the habitat. Repeat this process every 3-6 months to keep your collection of worms growing.",
