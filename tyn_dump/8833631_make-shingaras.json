Also chop your cauliflower and onion into small pieces. Finally, chop up your cilantro and grate your ginger. Roast your peanuts. Coat the bottom of a small skillet with cooking oil. Heat the oil over medium heat. Then add the peanuts and fry until they brown. Grind the peanuts. Transfer them to a paper towel. Let the towel absorb the excess oil. Then transfer them to a small bowl and grind with a mortar. Cooking the Filling Saute your panch phoron, ginger, and onion. First, coat the bottom of a large skillet with cooking oil and set the burner to medium heat. Once the oil heats up, add the Panch phoron . Once it begins to crackle, stir in the ginger and then the onions. Cook until the onions turn translucent (approximately three to four minutes.) Add the potatoes. Once the onions have turned translucent, stir in the potatoes. Cover the skillet with its lid. Then let the potatoes cook until they begin to turn tender (roughly five minutes). Add the cauliflower, peas, salt, and turmeric. Uncover the skillet. Stir in each new ingredient into the mixture until evenly combined. Add water and cook for ten minutes. Pour the water in.
