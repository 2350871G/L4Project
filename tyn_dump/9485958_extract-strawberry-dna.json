You will need the rubbing alcohol in a later step, but it must be chilled. Rubbing alcohol is also called ethanol sometimes, so if you see the name ethanol on the bottle but it appears to be rubbing alcohol, that's it. Remove the green section from the strawberry. Try to seize the leaves in one fist, then tug the entire crown of leaves out. If pulling doesn't work, cut the section out with a small kitchen knife. Mix three pinches of salt with 15 milliliters (0.51  fl oz) liquid dish soap in the small cup. Stir until salt is dissolved with a skewer. Set aside for later. Preparing the Strawberry Place your strawberry into your plastic bag. Then, push out the extra pockets of air and seal the opening. Keep your fingers on the outside of the plastic bag, then mash the strawberry for approximately ninety seconds. Don't be afraid to smash the strawberry well. Overall, the purpose of this step is to break up the cell membranes and enzymes in the strawberry cells. Open the plastic bag, then set it aside. Be careful not to spill the strawberry guts as you open the bag. Pour ten mL of your dish soap-salt mixture into the graduated cylinder. View the liquid at eye level as your pour. That way, you can make sure you have measured out the correct amount. Pour your measured-out liquid into the strawberry mush in the plastic bag. While performing the pouring process, make sure not to get any liquid caught on the seams of the plastic bag sealer. You may want to tip the bag one way. This will allow for all the liquid to flow into one corner of the plastic bag. Push out all the extra air in the bag and reseal. Smush with your fingers again for about one minute.

Hold the sticking-out corners so that the cheesecloth can't slide down into the funnel's tube. Another option is to simply hold the cheesecloth onto the funnel as you would hold a cup. Make sure your thumb and index finger form a circle. Position the cheesecloth-covered funnel. Make sure its end is in your beaker/test tube. Snip a slit in the corner of the plastic bag with the strawberry slush. Be careful not to cut the slit too big; otherwise, the slush will slide out too quickly. Pretend you're a pastry chef and you're cutting a hole in the end of an icing bag. Slowly squeeze out the strawberry slurry from the plastic bag onto the cheesecloth covering the funnel. Be sure not to rush, or else the slurry could spill everywhere and make a big mess. This process may take some time, but there should be strawberry-colored liquid dripping into your beaker/test tube filtered through the cheesecloth. Continue until all of your strawberry slurry is squeezed out of the plastic bag. Remove the cheesecloth from the top of the funnel. Do this when the strawberry liquid has mostly stopped dripping.

Inside the liquid, it may be difficult to see and may resemble clusters of bubbles. Observe the gooey substance once it's out of the water. This will be your DNA.
