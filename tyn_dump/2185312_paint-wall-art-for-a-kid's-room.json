    "text": " Deciding What to Paint Paint simple shapes in complimentary colors for a room belonging to an infant or young toddler. Think basic shapes, ABCs, and simple trees and flowers. Use either pastels or strong colors, but avoid bright, neon shades that may overwhelm your young child. Introduce animals into the design for older toddlers. Skip the pastels and neon shades, and stick with strong, eye-catching hues. Play to an older child's interests. Once your kid reaches school age, he or she will likely have his or her own interests and obsessions. Interests often include anything from animals to cityscapes and ballerinas to sports. Build a theme around your child's interests and paint wall art specifically tailored to those interests. Opt for simple, sophisticated designs once your child reaches the \"tween\" and \"teen\" stage. Images that use simple shapes and abstract designs will likely appeal to your maturing child more than specific pictures. Use muted colors or bright, funky shades depending on your child's personality. Painting by Hand Sketch your idea on the wall using light pencil strokes. Use a blue pencil with an eraser. If you cannot find a blue pencil, use a regular pencil with an eraser, instead. Use painters tape to section your illustration off. Tape is especially useful if you want to create straight lines, and sectioning your illustration off will prevent you from accidentally getting the wrong color on the wrong portion of the illustration. Pour your paint onto a paint palette. Use acrylic paints and start with colors you know you will use to complete the first section instead of pouring out all the paint at once.

Wait 24 hours for the first section of paint to dry.  Apply an acrylic sealer to the paint. Remove your painting tape and allow the sealer to dry. Reapply painters tape to unveil another section of your illustration. Paint and seal the paint using the same method you used for the first section.
