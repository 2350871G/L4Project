                    "description": "Use a deeply moisturizing shampoo made specifically for African hair. There are many brands on the market, so try out a couple of different shampoos to find which one works best for you personally. Choose a product that is sulfate-free (it will promote this on the front of the bottle, and you can confirm this by reading the ingredients and looking for a shampoo that does not have any ingredients that end or begin with the word sulfate). Sulfate can be very drying and strip hair of moisture. It is recommended that you wash your hair every 7 to 10 days for best results. You will want to follow the moisturizing and sealing steps daily, however. In addition to ensuring that the shampoo is sulfate free, check the label to make sure the shampoo you choose is alcohol-free. Alcohol can be very harsh and strip your hair of its natural oils. Choose a shampoo that has natural moisturizing oil, such as jojoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil, or emu oil.

Take down each section, one at a time, and apply a small amount of the oil (a pea-sized dollop should work) from root to tip, again concentrating on the ends. Experiment with each of the different oils listed above to see which works best for you. Don't over-do the oil. Using too much will weigh your hair down and may contribute to a greasy look. Use the minimum amount required with a special focus on the ends. When applying the oil, use a downward sweeping motion with your hair in between your palms. This will contribute to smoothness after completion. Don't mix your conditioner and oil together to save time. The process will not work properly and the moisture won't be sealed if you do that. Make sure you always moisturize with conditioner before sealing with the oil."
