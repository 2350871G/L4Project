        "Creating Simple Preserved Lemons Get enough lemons to fill your jar, plus a few extras.",
        "When making simple preserved lemons, you will pack the lemons into a jar tightly.",
        "This means that the minimum number of lemons you will need is as many as you can fit into the jar you are using.",
        "However, you may need some extra lemon juice to fill up the space in the jar, so getting a few more than you think you'll need is a good idea.",
        "For example, if you are using a jar that can hold about a cup (236 mL) of liquid, you will need about 2 to 3 lemons to fill it up, depending on the size of each lemon.",
        "Many people use pint (473 mL) mason jars for preserving lemons.",
        "These will take about 5 to 8 lemons to fill.",
        "It is better to get too many lemons than to have too few.",
        "Packing the jar tightly helps to keep out air and gives you more finished preserved lemons to use.",
        "Choose ripe conventional or Meyer lemons.",
        "The type of lemons you use solely depends on your personal preference.",
        "Whatever type of lemon you use, lemon pickles should be made with ripe lemons so that there is a lot of juice for the lemon rinds to be submerged in.",
        "To ensure that your lemons are ripe, squeeze potential lemons slightly and make sure they give a little.",
        "Ripe lemons should also be brightly colored and not shriveled.",
        "Meyer lemons are a bit sweeter than conventional lemons because they are thought to be a cross between a lemon and a mandarin orange.",
        "Sterilize your jar and lid.",
        "Clean the jar and lid with soap and hot water, making sure to rinse all soap out of it.",
        "Then submerge both pieces in boiling water for at least 10 minutes.",
        "To make sure that no bacteria grows in your lemons and that the jar isn't holding onto any scents from what was in it previously, it's important to sterilize it.",
        "Wash the outside of your lemons.",
        "Preserved lemons include the rind, so it's important to make sure they are clean before cutting them up.",
        "Simply rinse and scrub the lemons under running water to get rid of any pesticides or residue on the surface.",
        "You can use a kitchen scrubber or brush to clean the surface of the lemons.",
        "Don't use soap on the lemon.",
        "However, if you have baking soda, vinegar, or a product made to wash produce, you can use one of them to really clean the surface of the rind.",
        "Cut an \"x\" through the end of each lemon almost to the bottom.",
        "Look for the stem end of the lemon and hold it with that end up and the other end down on the cutting board.",
        "Use your knife to cut down the middle of the lemon, stopping about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) before the bottom.",
        "You want the end of the lemon to stay connected.",
        "Then take your knife and make a second cut down the middle of the lemon, but moving your knife position 90 degrees and keeping the bottom intact again.",
        "When you are done, the top of the lemon will be cut into quarters but the bottom will still be totally connected.",
        "Fill each lemon with salt.",
        "Open each lemon slightly where you cut it and pour salt into its core.",
        "Keep adding salt until it is flowing out the sides and the top.",
        "Use whatever type of salt you have on hand.",
        "In general, pickling salt is pure sodium chloride, while sea salt and kosher salt have natural minerals in them, which can enhance flavor.",
        "There is no exact amount of salt you will use for this, although each lemon will usually take more than a tablespoon (17 grams) of salt to fill.",
        "Add a thin layer of salt to the bottom of the jar.",
        "You only need to add about a tablespoon if you are using a pint mason jar.",
        "If you are using a smaller container, use a teaspoon or 2.",
        "This extra salt will help pickle the lemons in the jar.",
        "If you had extra salt that fell out of the lemons when you were filling them, feel free to use that to cover the bottom of the jar.",
        "Push the lemons tightly into the jar.",
        "Put the first lemon in the jar with the solid end down.",
        "Then pack the next couple with the cut side down, so the the pieces stick down into the cut end of the first lemon.",
        "Continue packing the lemons until they are tightly packed.",
        "Don't worry about breaking apart the lemons.",
        "It's more important to pack them tightly than to keep them whole.",
        "Fill any empty space with fresh lemon juice.",
        "As you pack the lemons, they will release their juice.",
        "This juice should fill up most of the extra space in the jar.",
        "However, there may be some space at the top that is just air.",
        "Add fresh juice until there is only a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) gap at the top of the jar.",
        "Create the extra juice by juicing some additional lemons.",
        "It's most important that all of the lemon rinds are totally submerged in lemon juice.",
        "Let the jar sit at room temperature for 3 to 4 weeks.",
        "Once the jar is packed, seal it with the lid.",
        "Then, every day or so, shake the jar to ensure that the salt is evenly distributed and that all of the lemons are getting pickled.",
        "You will know the preserved lemons are done when the white parts of the rinds have turned clear, which usually takes several weeks.",
        "When the whites of the rinds have become clear, this means they have become soft, pliable, and ready to add to your favorite dish.Tip: After the lemons are done, put the jar straight into the refrigerator and use the pickles within a year."
