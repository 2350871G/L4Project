The higher the number is for the R-value, the more effective the insulation will be. The R-value you need depends on your climate, the type of heating and cooling system you have, and which part of the house you want to insulate. Look at an online guide or ask an employee at a hardware store to help you determine which insulation you need for your home. For insulating walls, you usually need insulation that\u2019s R-13. Attics tend to need anywhere between R-30 and R-49 insulation. Basements usually require a rating between R-11 and R-25. If you want to insulate your floor, use R-12 to R-30 insulation depending on your climate zone."

        "There are usually small cracks or gaps in the corners between your floors and walls, which could lead to heat loss.",
        "Open a tube of silicone sealant and squeeze a small line of it into the corners of your floor to fill the gap.",
        "Smooth out the silicone with your fingertip or a sealant scraper to push it further into the gap to help it seal better.",
        "You can also use caulk in the same way to seal the gaps.",
        "Put door sweeps on exterior doors to keep air from coming in.",
        "Door sweeps cover the space between your floor and the bottom of the door to prevent drafts from blowing under them.",
        "If you get a door sweep with an adhesive back, simply cut it to the width of your door, peel off the backing, and attach it to the bottom.",
        "Otherwise, you may have to nail it into the door with the provided hardware.",
        "You can buy door sweeps from your local hardware store.",
        "Put thick curtains in front of your windows to prevent heat loss.",
        "When you leave your windows uncovered, they can transfer cold air inside your home.",
        "Hang up thick, dark curtains in front of your windows and keep them closed whenever you want to keep your house warm.",
        "The curtains will block the cold air from coming in any further so it doesn\u2019t affect the temperature of your home.Tip: Leave your curtains open when it\u2019s sunny so the sunlight can naturally warm up your room so you don\u2019t have to use as much energy to heat it.",
        "Cover hard floors with rugs or carpeting so they stay warm.",
        "Hard floors, such as tile, laminate, or wood, can absorb heat and make your home less efficient.",
        "Lay out rugs, carpets, or blankets to cover exposed flooring to keep the heat in your home.",
        "Pick a rug or carpet that matches the style of the rest of your room and lay it out to cover as much of the floor as you can.",
        "Uninsulated floors can cause up to 10% of your home\u2019s heat loss.",
        "Have double-pane windows installed to prevent air leaks.",
        "Single-pane windows only have 1 piece of glass, which makes it easier for cold air to transfer inside and hot air to transfer out.",
        "Double-pane windows have a second piece of glass to the cold and hot air can\u2019t transfer between the panes.",
        "Check the windows in your home to see if they\u2019re single-pane and contact a window specialist to replace them for you.",
        "If can\u2019t replace your windows, you can also get clear plastic window film that seals onto the frame to prevent heat from escaping.",
        "Insulating Existing Walls Consider hiring a contractor to install insulation in finished walls.",
        "While you can install insulation in finished walls on your own, it can be difficult since you have to cut through your existing drywall.",
        "There is also special equipment that you need to rent if you want to do it on your own.",
        "If you don\u2019t feel comfortable cutting into your walls, find an insulation service near you and ask for a price quote to find out how much it would cost.",
        "Inject expanding foam insulation into your wall for the most effective treatment.",
        "Expanding foam increases in size once you inject it into your walls to seal the areas between the wall studs perfectly.",
        "Buy or rent an injection foam machine and wear disposable coveralls with goggles and a face mask to protect yourself.",
        "Drill a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) hole at the top of your wall and put the machine\u2019s hose through it.",
        "Turn the machine on to spread the foam between the studs.",
        "Continue working around your room between each of the studs.",
        "Injection foam usually requires a contractor to install safely, but you may be able to rent a machine from hardware stores to do it on your own.",
        "You can either drill through your exterior siding or your inside walls to inject the foam.",
        "Blow in loose-fill insulation if you want to be minimally invasive.",
        "Rent a blower machine from a hardware store with enough loose-fill insulation for your home.",
        "Cut holes in your wall that are large enough for the blower\u2019s hose between each of the studs.",
        "Feed the loose-fill insulation into the machine and position the hose in the holes.",
        "Turn on the machine to blow the loose-fill into your walls until it\u2019s tightly packed.",
        "Loose-fill insulation is made from small chunks either fiberglass or flame-retardant cellulose material that settle in your walls.",
        "Loose-fill insulation can settle and compress over time, so it may not be as effective as it gets older.",
        "Remove the existing drywall to install rolls of fiberglass insulation.",
        "Use a drywall saw or a utility knife to cut through the walls you already have and remove them completely.",
        "Get rolls of fiberglass insulation that have a vapor barrier so you have enough to insulate the room.",
        "Push the insulation into your wall so it fits snugly and sits flush with the studs.",
        "Staple the insulation in place before installing new drywall.",
        "Only tear down your existing drywall if you can\u2019t use loose-fill or expanding foam insulation."
