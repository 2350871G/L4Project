You can put your blender in the freezer or pour out your Slurpee into a glass or cup before putting it into your freezer. Making a Healthy Slurpee Add fruit and water into your blender. Make sure to peel and cut your fruit into pieces that your blender can manage. Your fruit can be frozen or fresh depending on your preference. Some healthy fruits that you can use include, banana, watermelon, mango, and peaches. Add agave nectar or lemonade and ice to your blender. Agave nectar is a healthier alternative to sugar and will help enhance the taste of your Slurpee. If you can't get Agave nectar, you can use lemonade or more sparkling water as an alternative. If you like your Slurpee sweeter, then add more agave nectar. Turn your blender on high until your drink is slushy.

Drink the Slurpee as soon as you're finished blending, or the ice will melt, and it will lose its consistency. Making a Soda Slurpee Shake an unopened bottle of soda for 5-10 seconds. Shaking the drink will build up pressure in the bottle. Make sure not to open it after shaking, or it will explode and leave a mess. You can use whatever flavor soda you prefer.
