Superglue is very thin, and while it's strong, it won't protect your pottery from future breakages along the same cracks as well as epoxy will.Warning: If your piece of pottery is used with food, like a mug or a soup bowl, look for a food-safe adhesive or one that is silicone based.

        "If needed, use a toothpick to poke it into small, hard to reach areas.",
        "It's okay if the filler isn't even with the rest of the pottery\u2014you'll deal with that part later.",
        "Even though the filler might resemble putty, don't use your hands to put it in place.",
        "Continue using your wooden or plastic stick.",
        "Shave off the excess filler with a razor once it has hardened.",
        "Epoxy filler can take anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days to harden, so make sure to check the manufacturer's instructions for that information.",
        "Use a razor or a straight-edged knife to shave off larger chunks of filler that is raised up over the surface of the piece of pottery.",
        "Don't worry about getting the edges to look perfect with the razor.",
        "You'll use sandpaper later on to smooth things out.",
        "Sandpaper the filler-filled area to smooth it down.",
        "Take a piece of 220-grit sandpaper and gently rub it back and forth over the repaired area.",
        "Keep working at it until the surface is once again completely smooth.",
        "Once you're done sanding, give the piece another wipe down with alcohol to get rid of any sandpaper and filler residue.Tip: For sections that have corners or edges, wrap sandpaper around a dowel to give yourself a little more control over the sanding process.",
        "Paint the repaired area with acrylic paint to match the original color.",
        "Because the filler is most likely brown or white, you'll probably want to paint it so it doesn't stick out as much from the rest of the piece.",
        "Take your time matching the color of the paint to the color of the piece of pottery.",
        "Try thinning the acrylic paint with a little bit of water so that it can be applied more evenly over the surface.",
        "Finish the piece with a coat of clear spray acrylic to give it a shine.",
        "This spray will add a layer of gloss to the repaired area, which will make it stand out from the rest of the piece less.",
        "If possible, use the spray outside or in a well-ventilated area so that you aren't bothered by the fumes.",
        "Let the gloss completely dry before you use or display the pottery piece again.",
        "It generally takes acrylic spray about 12 to 24 hours to completely dry.",
        "Test it by patting it with your thumb\u2014if it still feels tacky it needs more time."
