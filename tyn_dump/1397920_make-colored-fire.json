Sprinkling Chemicals on a Fire Build a campfire. Sprinkling the chemicals directly on the fire typically works best on campfires. Allow your fire to burn until there is a bed of red embers beneath it and the flames have died down a bit. For the best results, the flames should be approximately 1 foot (30 cm) high. Sprinkle a small amount of the chemical on the embers. Start with just a pinch to test the chemical and ensure that no adverse reactions occur. Be sure to stand back a bit as you add the powder to the fire to protect yourself. Sprinkle the chemical on the edge of the fire rather than just tossing it into the middle.

Wear a protective breathing mask while adding chemicals to the fire, and be mindful of which way the smoke is going. Continue adding the chemicals until the color changes. The first sprinkle of the chemical will likely not change the flames' color, so you should keep adding more until you notice a change. In many cases, it can take up to a minute for the color change to be visible. Making Wax Cakes Melt paraffin wax in a double boiler. Place a heatproof bowl over a pot of water that's simmering on medium on the stove. Add several pieces of paraffin wax and allow them to heat until they're completely melted. You can use blocks of canning wax from the grocery store or stubs from old candles for the wax. Don't melt the wax over an open flame or you may start a fire. Stir in the chemical powder.

You can add more than one wax cake with different chemicals to the fire at a time, but toss them on different parts of the fire. The wax cakes work well in a campfire or a fireplace. Soaking Wood in Chemicals Collect dry, lightweight fire materials. Wood items like chips, scraps of lumber, pine cones, and kindling are all good options. You can also use rolled-up newspapers. Dissolve the chemical in water. Mix 1 pound (454 g) of your chosen chemical per every gallon (3.78 liter) of water in a plastic container. Stir well to help the powder dissolve more quickly. For the best results, use a single chemical per container of water. You can use a glass container, but avoid metal containers, which may react with the chemicals. Take care not to drop or break any glass containers in your campsite or near the firepit or fireplace. Be sure to wear safety glasses, rubber gloves, and a protective mask or respirator when mixing the chemical solution.
