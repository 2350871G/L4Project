    "text": " Simple Wooden Birdhouse Cut the wood to the sizes needed. Cut out 7-9 6x6 pieces of wood, measuring 2cm-5cm thick and thin, depending on your intended size. These form the 4 walls, the 1 floor and the 2 roof pieces. Using a compass, draw a circle on one of the squares. Depending on the bird you're hoping to encourage to stay, the circle should be of the size it can adequately fit into. Once drawn, cut out the circle using a suitable saw. Assemble the house. Using wood glue would be easiest but if you can nail it together, then that is preferable, as it will be more durable. Placing the floor down, glue 5 pieces together to form a cube without a lid. The square with the hole in it should be at the front of the house. Put the roof on. Nail the roof on to ensure that it is absolutely secure. Be sure to secure it so that the rain can't get inside. Paint the house. Use waterproof paint, so that it will last for a long time. Be sure to check that it is not toxic to the birds though. Hang up the simple birdhouse. If you want birds to find it, place it somewhere visible, such as on your porch, out in a tree, or simply just sitting on a bench. Terracotta Pot Birdhouse Choose a terracotta pot in a suitable size for the birds you wish to accommodate and attract. For the sake of this tutorial, assume that the terracotta pot is about 160mm x 160mm in diameter. Change the measurements from top to bottom according to how much bigger or smaller your pot is. Measure the diameter of the pot about 2 inches or 5cm from the top of the pot. This diameter will serve as the measurement for your wooden circle. Draw the circle size onto a piece of pine wood. Use a jigsaw or similar cutting saw to cut out the circle shape. Measure a small circle about 2 inches/5cm from what will be the top of the circle. The circle size should be just enough to allow the bird to hop in and out of the hole. Cut the hole out. If you wish to weatherproof the wood, use a non-toxic food-grade stain or sealant. Birds are sensitive to many chemicals. Attach a small hook to the wooden piece. This should be placed about 2 inches/5cm up from the base of the circle. This serves as both a perch and as the pulling and pushing mechanism for removing and putting back the circle piece. Screw the terracotta pot to a post or wall. Use the hole already in the base of the pot and drill into the post or wall. You'll need a screw or bolt large enough for the hole. Line the birdhouse with straw or other material. Push the circle piece into place. Done. The birdhouse is now ready for its new bird residents to move in. Keep the birdhouse clean; simply pull out the wooden circle, clean out the inside of the pot, then replace the circle by pushing it back in. Old Jug or Pitcher Birdhouse Find a suitable old jug or pitcher. Look in thrift or antique stores; or, maybe you have one in your house. It can be made from any materials, provided the material is safe for birds. Wash and clean out the container. Allow to dry thoroughly before using. Seal off the spout. Stuff old rags or similar into the spout, to prevent drafts from whistling up it. Then seal off the entrance inside of the jug or pitcher with a block of wood or similar safe item. Slide the handle of the jug onto a hook. Hang in place from a rafter or similar position, away from drafts or winds. Fill with bedding. That's it. It's now ready for a bird to move in. Old Boot Birdhouse Find an old boot. Perhaps you have a pair of boots that have one good boot and one boot in bad shape. Toss out the old boot and use the good boot for a birdhouse. Or, if both old boots are in good shape, but you just don't want to wear them anymore, make two birdhouses. Clean the boot. Give it a warm, soapy wash to remove dirt, dust, etc. Tie the shoelaces together neatly, in a nice bow. Stuff the boot with newspaper or clean rags. Stuff from the toe up to about two thirds the way of the sole. This will make a nice snug place for the bird to lay her eggs and the chicks to sit on. Glue or nail a hook to the back of the boot. This should be strong and firmly attached. It is what you will use to attach the boot to the tree. Knock a small U-shaped nail into the trunk. Place it at the level you want the birdhouse to be. Do this carefully; you only want to make the slightest of marks in the tree. The U-shaped nail should be strong and solid enough to hold the weight of the boot and its inhabitants. If you'd rather not attach the boot birdhouse to the tree's trunk, attach it to a flat piece of wood, then attach the wood to a post, using nails. Attach the boot to the side of a tree trunk. Slide the hook over the U-shaped nail on the tree. Check that it is sitting firmly. Wait for your bird family to move in. Depending on the weather, the boot may last one season or it may last two. If it still looks good after one season, remove it from the hook and leave it in the garden shed over winter (place it inside a stocking to prevent insects crawling inside it), then hang it out again next spring. Duct Tape Birdhouse Find a strong cardboard box in a square shape. It must be a good size for the birds, not too big and not too small. Cardboard is an excellent insulator and will keep the birds cozy inside. Tape the lid closed.  Cut out a bird hole at the front of the box. Cut a circular hole to the size of the expected birds. Cover the entire birdhouse in duct tape. This will strengthen and slightly waterproof the house. Do at least two layers for thoroughness. Cut carefully when sticking the tape around the hole; do not leave any sharp edges, but smooth it all down and around the hole. Pierce two small holes in the top of the box, in the center area. Pass thin wire or strong twine through the holes and tie in a firm loop. Attach a carabiner to the loop. Drop some bedding inside the house.  Hang the birdhouse from a hook under the roof or rafters. It's now ready for the birds.",

        "Give it a warm, soapy wash to remove dirt, dust, etc.",
        "Tie the shoelaces together neatly, in a nice bow.",
        "Stuff the boot with newspaper or clean rags.",
        "Stuff from the toe up to about two thirds the way of the sole.",
        "This will make a nice snug place for the bird to lay her eggs and the chicks to sit on.",
        "Glue or nail a hook to the back of the boot.",
        "This should be strong and firmly attached.",
        "It is what you will use to attach the boot to the tree.",
        "Knock a small U-shaped nail into the trunk.",
        "Place it at the level you want the birdhouse to be.",
        "Do this carefully; you only want to make the slightest of marks in the tree.",
        "The U-shaped nail should be strong and solid enough to hold the weight of the boot and its inhabitants.",

        "Slide the hook over the U-shaped nail on the tree.",
        "Check that it is sitting firmly.",

        "Depending on the weather, the boot may last one season or it may last two.",
        "If it still looks good after one season, remove it from the hook and leave it in the garden shed over winter (place it inside a stocking to prevent insects crawling inside it), then hang it out again next spring.",
        "Duct Tape Birdhouse Find a strong cardboard box in a square shape.",
        "It must be a good size for the birds, not too big and not too small.",

        "Cut out a bird hole at the front of the box.",
        "Cut a circular hole to the size of the expected birds.",

        "Pass thin wire or strong twine through the holes and tie in a firm loop.",
