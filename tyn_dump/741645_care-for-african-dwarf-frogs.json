Having more than one at a time is really not any extra work, and you'll have happier, healthier frogs. These frogs can be in a tank with fish but avoid putting them in with aggressive fish. For instance, Bettas can be good tank mates, but it depends on the Betta, as some of them are more aggressive than others; if you put a Betta in with these frogs, watch their behavior, particularly at meal time, to see if the Betta is bullying the frogs."

Choose a shallow tank to make it easier for the frogs to get to the surface. While these frogs stay in water all the time, they actually don't swim all that well. Make sure to get a tank with a secure lid, as the frogs can jump out.

Also, frogs can look bloated, like they may explode, which is likely due to a bacterial infection unrelated to fungus. For either one, add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of aquarium salt per 4 gallons (15 L) of water. Stir it into a cup of dechlorinated water before adding it to the aquarium to dissolve it. If you notice fungus or bacterial infections, talk to a veterinarian before treating your frogs. If only one frog has a fungal infection, move it to its own tank to treat it. Aim for as big a tank as you can manage. Only do this when the frogs have fungus or bloat, as they are not that fond of the salt. However, it should get rid of the fungus. If it doesn't, talk to your vet. Avoid fish fungal medicines, as it can harm frogs. Copper-based medications, especially, are toxic to frogs.

Prepare the new tank in the same way you did for your frogs, but keep in mind, each egg could become a frog, so you may want a significantly bigger tank. If you don't move them, the frogs may eat them. You can feed live, baby brine shrimp to the tadpoles when they emerge."
