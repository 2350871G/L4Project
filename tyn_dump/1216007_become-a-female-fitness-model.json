If you\u2019re just starting your fitness career, you\u2019ll need time to build up your cardio endurance and strength. Exercise five to seven times a week for 30-60 minutes each day. Do cardiovascular activity such as fast walking, jogging, biking, dancing or aerobics. Also perform weight training activities such as sit-ups, push-ups, lunges, squats and working out with weights. Meet with a personal trainer to develop an exercise plan that works for you. A personal trainer can help you develop a routine that fits your lifestyle and goals.
