A Recipe Example Before starting, turn on the oven to preheat at 360F/180C. Drizzle the maple syrup into the base of the non-stick loaf pan. Arrange the pear slices on top of the maple syrup.  Make the cake batter. In a large roomy saucepan (yes, that's right, saucepan), melt the butter and stir in the brown sugar. Keep stirring to combine.
