If you have a corded drill, you can skip this step. Drills without a full charge don\u2019t spin at a consistent speed and make it more difficult to make a clean hole in the wood.Tip: Keep a spare drill battery in case you need to charge one while working on a large job."

Stepped drill bits have a narrower tip and a wider base so a screw can easily slide into the hole it makes. Loosen the chuck, the area where the bit is held, by spinning it counter-clockwise. Slide your stepped bit into place and tighten the chuck by turning it clockwise. Stepped bits can be purchased at your local hardware store.

Plug your drill battery into the charging base and let it sit until the charging light turns green. When the battery is full, plug it back into your drill.

Set your drill to the fastest speed setting. Many drills usually come with 2-3 different speed settings. Turn the dial or switch on your drill that adjusts the speed until it shows the highest number. Higher speeds will leave your pocket holes with a clean edge rather than a rough one. Using a Jig Secure the jig to your work station. Pocket hole jigs have holes in the base so you can easily screw them into your work surface. Place a screw in each of the holes and use an electric screwdriver to secure the jig to your table. If you don\u2019t want to damage your work surface by screwing in the jig, secure the back of it to the edge of the table using a hand clamp. Pocket hole jigs can be purchased from your local hardware store or online. Set the height of the jig to match the thickness of the board. Look at the top of your jig for the slide with measurements written on it. Pull the stopper out next to slide so you can adjust the height of the jig to the thickness of the wood you\u2019re drilling into. Once you set the height, place the stopper back in to secure it. Double check the wood\u2019s actual thickness since it may vary from board to board. Adjust the collar on the drill bit so the end is \u20448 in (0.32 cm) off the jig. The collar is a band of metal that comes on each stepped drill bit so you don\u2019t drill too far through the wood. Use a hex wrench to loosen the bolt on the collar and slide it towards the drill. Slide the drill bit through one of the guide holes until it\u2019s \u20448 in (0.32 cm) from the bottom of the jig. Tighten the collar in place so it doesn\u2019t move. Clamp the wooden board into the jig. Set the end of the wood you\u2019re drilling in the jig so it\u2019s flush against the slide with the guide holes. Push the clamp on the other side of the jig so it holds the wood in place against the guide. Locate the lever on the front of the job and pull it down so the clamp grasps the wood firmly in place. If your jig doesn\u2019t have a clamp on it, then use a hand clamp to hold the board in place. Place your drill bit in one of the guide holes on the jig.

As soon as the bit is out from the guide, release the trigger and let the drill slow to a stop. Use the other guide hole to make a second pocket hole. Go to the hole closest to the other side of your wood, and feed the drill bit into the guide. Pull the trigger and push the drill through the wood until the collar stops it. Pull the drill back out before releasing the trigger. Make sure the drill is up to full speed before making your second hole. Always use at least 2 pocket holes to make your joint. Otherwise, the wood could spin once it\u2019s connected to another piece. Making Pocket Holes Freehand Clamp the wood to your work surface. Place the clamp about 1 foot (30 cm) from the area where you plan on drilling so it\u2019s not in the way. Tighten the clamp so the wood is held against your work surface and doesn\u2019t move. Mark the angle of the hole on the edge of your board. Measure about 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) from the end of your board and make a line to mark where to start your holes. Turn the board onto its edge and draw a 45-degree angle from the line to the other side of your board. Flip the board over and repeat the process on the other side. Use a speed square to help draw the angle if you need to. Hold the drill so the bit is perpendicular to the wood. Set the drill bit on your board about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the edge. Hold the drill handle with your dominant hand and keep the top of the drill straight with your non-dominant hand. Make sure the bit is pointing straight down into the wood. Drill \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) straight into the wood. Squeeze the trigger completely on your drill so it\u2019s running at the fastest speed.
