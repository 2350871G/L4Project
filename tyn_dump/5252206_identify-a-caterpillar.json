When you find a caterpillar, try to identify the plants around it, and observe as it eats the leaves, flowers, or even fruit in its habitat. These can give you a better idea of what species of caterpillar you\u2019re looking at. For example, Monarch butterfly caterpillars tend to live on and eat milkweed. In contrast, centipedes, millipedes, and worms tend to live in the dirt, under rocks, or in rotting wood."
