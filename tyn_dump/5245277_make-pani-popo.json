Knead the dough for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. This step incorporates more air into the dough, so you'll have airy bread if you complete it. If you prefer dense bread, however, skip or shorten the knead time. You can add a little flour to the dough as you knead it, but try to avoid adding too much. This dough must remain sticky and soft.

Spray the bowl with a little nonstick cooking spray before placing the dough inside. After placing the dough inside, it's also a good idea to turn it once so that all sides are coated in the cooking spray. This reduces the surface stickiness of the dough.

        "Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl.",
        "Cover it with a clean dish towel and let it rise in a warm spot for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in size.",
        "Spray the bowl with a little nonstick cooking spray before placing the dough inside.",
        "After placing the dough inside, it's also a good idea to turn it once so that all sides are coated in the cooking spray.",
        "This reduces the surface stickiness of the dough.",
        "For best results, let the dough rise in a spot that is both warm and draft-free.",
        "Punch the dough down.",
        "After the dough has doubled in size, use your fist to lightly punch it back down.",
        "If you the dough clings to your hand when you touch it, you can spray a little cooking spray onto your skin or dust your hands lightly with flour.",
        "Divide into pieces.",
        "Break the dough into 12 evenly sized pieces.",
        "Roll these pieces into balls.",
        "The simplest way to form dough balls is to simply pinch the dough off in chunks and roll them into shape.",
        "Another option would be to roll the entire portion of dough into a long cylinder.",
        "Use a knife to slice that cylinder into evenly sized 1-inch (2.5-cm) rounds.",
        "Arrange the dough balls in the baking pan.",
        "Place the dough balls in a lightly greased 12-inch (30-cm) round baking pan.",
        "Spray the baking pan with nonstick cooking spray before placing the dough balls inside.",
        "Let rise.",
        "Loosely cover the unbaked rolls with the same dish towel and place them back in a warm location.",
        "Let them rise for 30 minutes, or until they have nearly doubled in size.",
        "Alternatively, you can let the dough rise slowly by placing it in your refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.",
        "Prepare the coconut sauce as the dough balls rise.",
        "Stir the coconut milk.",
        "Before you measure out the coconut milk, give the can or container a thorough stir.",
        "Coconut milk has a tendency to coagulate.",
        "When you are working with an unopened can, you can usually smooth it out by shaking the can.",
        "When working with an opened can, you'll need to stir the contents to combine them again.",
        "Combine the coconut milk with the remaining ingredients.",
        "In a medium bowl, combine the coconut milk, water, and sugar.",
        "Whisk together until smooth and evenly combined.",
        "Note that the mixture may seem overly sweet at this point if you taste it now.",
        "As it bakes, though, much of the sweetness will be absorbed by the buns, making the sauce itself a little less sugary.",
        "Cover the coconut sauce loosely and set it aside as you wait for the dough to finish rising.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).",
        "You may want to preheat the oven shortly before the dough has fully risen.",
        "Pour the coconut sauce over the dough.",
        "Evenly pour the coconut sauce over the unbaked rolls, making sure that each roll is thoroughly drenched.",
        "Some of the sauce should cling to the surface of the dough, coating the tops and sides.",
        "Note that most of the sauce will sink to the bottom of the pan, though.",
        "If you prefer crispier buns and less sauce, you can brush a little of the sauce on the tops and sides of each roll with a pastry brush instead of pouring the entire batch of sauce on top.",
        "When using this option, you will not use all of the prepared coconut sauce and there should be very little sauce sitting in the bottom of the pan.",
        "Sprinkle with raw sugar.",
        "If desired, lightly sprinkle a little raw sugar over the tops of the buns.",
        "Since the sauce is so sweet as it is, it might be best to skip this step the first time you prepare the pani popo.",
        "If the sauce itself does not overwhelm you when you taste the finished product, you can add this final dusting of sugar the next time you prepare the dish.",
        "Bake 20 to 30 minutes.",
        "Place the rolls in your preheated oven and cook until the crust is a deep golden brown.",
        "Note that the internal temperature of the buns should be 190 degrees Fahrenheit (88 degrees Celsius).",
        "Serve fresh.",
        "Let the finished buns cool slightly, but enjoy them while they are still warm and fresh.",
        "Try waiting for 30 minutes before serving the buns.",
        "This allows the bread to set and the sauce to thicken.",
        "Serve the buns straight from the pan and scoop up any extra sauce with a spoon, or invert the pan and serve the rolls upside-down.",
        "Shortcut Pani Popo[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Prepare a baking dish.",
        "Coat a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking dish with cooking spray.",
        "A round 12-inch (30-cm) baking dish would also work.",
        "Coat the dough balls with cooking spray.",
        "Cover your hands with nonstick cooking spray.",
        "Take each thawed ball of dough in your hands and roll it gently, coating all sides of the surface with the cooking spray.",
        "You can use shortening or cooking oil instead of cooking spray, if desired.",
        "Each dough ball must have a light coating of oil.",
        "Let rise for 2 hours.",
        "Evenly arrange the balls of dough in your prepared baking dish.",
        "Set the dish aside and let the dough rise until doubled in size.",
        "Cover the dough with a clean dish towel to protect it from dust and debris.",
        "For best results, place the dough in a warm, draft-free spot as it rises.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).",
        "Depending on how long it takes your oven to preheat, you may want to do this shortly before the rolls have finished rising.",
        "Combine the remaining three ingredients.",
        "Add the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and white sugar to a small mixing bowl.",
        "Whisk the ingredients together into a smooth, even sauce.",
        "This sauce will be quite sweet.",
        "If you would prefer a milder sauce, decrease the amount of sugar down to 2 or 3 Tbsp (30 or 45 ml).",
        "Pour the coconut milk mixture over the rolls.",
        "Once the rolls have finished rising, evenly pour the coconut sauce over the tops and sides of the dough.",
        "The sauce should cling to the surface of each roll, but most of it will sink down to the bottom of the pan.",
        "Bake for 30 minutes.",
        "Place the rolls in your preheated oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they turn golden brown in color.",
        "Cool and enjoy.",
        "Remove the finished pani popo from the oven.",
        "Let the rolls cool for a few minutes, then enjoy them while they are still warm and fresh.",
        "Scoop the individual rolls directly out of the pan and onto serving plates.",
        "Spoon any extra sauce from the bottom of the pan over the top of each roll before enjoying.",
        "Alternatively, invert the pan onto a large serving platter and serve the rolls upside-down (sauce-side up)."
