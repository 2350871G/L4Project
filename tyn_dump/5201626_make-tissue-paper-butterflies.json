This will make the wings. To save time, stack the papers first, and then cut them all at once. Stack the papers, one on top of each other. Make sure that the corners and edges are aligned. If you are using more than one color, stack them in an order that you like. Fold the paper, accordion style, until you have a 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick strip. Fold the bottom edge up by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Flip the paper over and fold it up by another inch (2.54 centimeters).

Consider cutting a small notch or V-shape into each end of the folded fan/accordion. This will give your butterfly a more interesting design.

Position it just above the folded tissue paper. Everything should be fitted snugly in the groove part of the clothespin. Decorate the clothespin body. You can color it with markers or with paints. You can even glue on tiny googly eyes or draw a silly face. To make an extra fancy butterfly, decorate the body with glitter glue and rhinestones. Making a Stained Glass Butterfly Fold a sheet of black construction paper in half widthwise, and draw half of a butterfly. Don't make the butterfly too small! It should be almost the same size as the paper. Also, make sure that the body of the butterfly is aligned with folded part of the paper. This makes the outer part of your frame.

The wings should be hollow. This will make the inner part of the frame. If you'd like your butterfly to have a solid/black body, only cut out inside the wings. Don't extend the frame to the fold.

Peel off the backing, and set it down on the table, sticky-side-up. Place the butterfly frame down onto the contact paper. Cut the tissue paper into squares. Make them between 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Use lots of different colors to make your butterfly look more interesting. You can even cut some of the squares into rectangles inside. Stick the tissue paper onto the wings. The tissue paper will stick to the contact paper, so you don't have to use any glue. This will create the stained glass effect.

You can also tape the butterfly to a window if you won't want to punch a hole through its wings. The side with the black outline is the front, and the tissue paper side is the back. Making a Butterfly Garland Cut out your butterfly template out of a sheet of paper. Fold a sheet of paper in half. Sketch out half of a butterfly and then cut it out. This will make your template which you will be basing the rest of your butterflies on. It will make your garland more consistent. Make the butterfly no more than 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) tall. You should only draw and cut the wings; don't worry about the body. You will be making it out of pipe cleaner later.

Gently spread the antenna apart, and curl each end for that final touch. Gently fluff the wings up. This will give your butterflies are more fluttery appearance.
