Many of the procedures you'll use to care for your running or clumping plants will be interchangeable among these two plants, but there are some differences you may want to take into account for aesthetic purposes. Running bamboo has thick canes spaced at regular intervals, much like the stereotypical image of bamboo. Clumping bamboo has thinner canes, a bush-like appearance, and its canes appear to sprout from the same, or nearly the same, location in the ground. Running bamboo makes for a better screen when planted. Unlike clumping bamboo, which has drooping top segments and a narrow base, runners naturally form a screen with straight, vertical stalks."

Additionally, it will deter weeds from encroaching on your bamboo plants. Spread your mulch carefully around young stalks and newly emerging bamboo. Too much mulch can damage the plant or make it difficult to grow. You can spread mulch freely around the stalks of heartier, more established plants.

If your bamboo is growing in an open area, this might not be a problem, however you can easily prevent the roots of your running bamboo from becoming invasive by trimming the roots. Build an underground barrier 30 inches (76.2 cm) deep and 2.4 inches (6.1 cm) thick around your bamboo to prevent unwanted root spreading. Set a boundary for the roots of your bamboo plant and then dig a narrow trench on that boundary about 1 foot (.3 m) deep. Trim or sever any roots that you find in this trench, and check it regularly for new root growths. Trimming the roots of your running bamboo will not harm the plant. These roots can usually be found roughly 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep in the soil."
