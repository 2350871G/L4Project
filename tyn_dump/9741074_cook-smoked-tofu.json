When the oil shimmers, stir in the smoked tofu pieces. Stir and saut\u00e9 the smoked tofu until it's golden brown on all sides. Scoop the tofu onto a plate and set it aside. Saut\u00e9 the onion, carrots, and whites of the scallions for 5 minutes. Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil into the wok or skillet. Stir in the chopped onion, carrots, and scallions. Stir and cook the vegetables until they're slightly soft. Stir in and saut\u00e9 the garlic and ginger for 1 minute. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 tablespoon (6 g) of minced fresh ginger to the wok or skillet. Stir the mixture just until you can smell the garlic and ginger. Stir in and fry the rice and scallion greens for 3 minutes. Scoop 4 cups (1 kg) of cooked short-grain brown rice and the scallion greens into the wok or skillet. Stir and cook the fried rice over high heat until the rice turns golden and slightly crispy. Try to use cold cooked rice for the best results. Make a well in the center of the rice and pour in the 4 beaten eggs. Use a spoon to scoop the rice away from the middle of the wok or skillet. Move the rice to the sides so you can pour the beaten eggs in the center. Stir and cook the eggs for 1 minute. Keep the burner on high and let the eggs cook in the middle of the pan until they're softly cooked. Stir the eggs, but keep them in the center. Mix the eggs into the rice and cook for 1 minute. Use a spatula or large spoon to stir the cooked eggs into the rice. Keep stirring as you cook the mixture. Stir in the smoked tofu, soy sauce, peas, and cook it for 1 more minute. Add the saut\u00e9ed smoked tofu into fried rice along with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of soy sauce and 1/2 cup (75 g) of sweet peas. Continue to stir and cook the fried rice over high heat for 1 minute. Serve the smoked tofu fried rice. Turn off the burner and divide the fried rice among 4 serving bowls. Garnish the fried rice with extra scallion greens and enjoy the fried rice immediately. Store the leftovers in an airtight container. Refrigerate and use them within 2 to 3 days. Creating Spinach and Smoked Tofu Tahini Toasts Stir together the tahini and lemon juice. Measure 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of tahini into a small bowl. Squeeze half of a lemon and pour the juice into the bowl. Stir the mixture until it's combined and thin. Set the sauce aside. If the mixture is too thick to drizzle from a spoon, stir in a few drops of water to thin it. Saut\u00e9 the baby spinach and onions for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of olive oil into a skillet and turn the burner on to medium. Stir in 2 cups (60 g) of baby spinach and 1 cup (110 g) of chopped mushrooms. Cook the vegetables until the spinach wilts and the mushrooms soften a little. Stir in the smoked tofu, garlic, salt, and pepper. Dice 3 \u20442 ounces (99 g) of smoked tofu into \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) pieces and stir it into the skillet along with 1 clove of minced garlic. Add salt and pepper according to your taste. Cook the smoked tofu mixture for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir the tofu as it heats. Cook the mixture until the garlic becomes fragrant. Toast the sourdough bread. Put 2 slices of sourdough bread in a toaster and heat them until they're as crisp and golden as you like. Assemble the tahini tofu toasts. Place the toast on serving plates and spoon a little tahini lemon sauce over the bread. Spread half of the smoked tofu mixture on each toast and sprinkle both with the toasted pine nuts. Garnish the toasts with a sprinkle of paprika and serve them immediately. Avoid storing the tahini tofu toasts because the bread will become soggy as it's stored. Frying Smoked Tofu and Vegetable Hash Saut\u00e9 the red onion for 5 to 7 minutes over medium heat. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil into a large skillet. Once the oil shimmers, stir in 1 large minced onion and cook it until it softens. Boil 2 diced sweet potatoes in salted water for 2 minutes. Fill a large pot of water 3/4 full with water. Add a few pinches of salt and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the diced sweet potatoes to the water and boil them until they soften a little.
