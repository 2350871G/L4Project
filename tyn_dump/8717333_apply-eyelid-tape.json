This will help to ensure that the tape adheres well and stays put during the day. Try using eye makeup remover to get all of the eye makeup off of your eyes before you apply the tape. Dry your face thoroughly after washing it, then wait about 5 minutes to apply eyelid tape to ensure there is no remaining moisture on your skin."

You will need to peel away the piece of plastic covering the eyelid strip as well. The strips might be just the right size for your eyelids, or you might need to trim them. The strips should be slightly shorter than the width of your eyes. Otherwise, the strips may stick out on the sides of your eyelids. If necessary, trim the strip to make it a little narrower. You can also make your own eyelid tape out of double sided medical tape if you cannot find eyelid tape strips. To do this cut the tape into a slim strip that is about the same width as your eyelid."
