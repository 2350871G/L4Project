Make the more important panels larger, and the less important panels smaller. For example, the punchline could take up the bottom half of a page, while the other panels could take up the top half. For beginners, you might want to start with the classic four panel approach. Simply divide your paper into four quarters, creating four scenes for each page. Use thick lines when sectioning off the panels of your pages. You don\u2019t want these lines to be confused for the sketch work you add when you put character-shapes and background images in your panels.

Remember to draw important tools or features that are part of the setting. For example, instead of suddenly drawing King Arthur holding his sword, draw the sword in the stone in the background of the previous panel. Include local features to set the tone. For example, if your comic takes place on an alien planet, you might draw three moons in the night sky to give the reader that impression. Use layers to give the impression of distance.

        "You want to have a background, middle ground, and foreground.",
        "Draw your characters.",
        "Since you already know your plot, you should know roughly how your characters are going to play out the scene.",
        "Your characters will either be confronting each other or some other plot point, and around this interaction you\u2019ll write the substance of your comic.",
        "This substance is conveyed through character dialogue bubbles and narrative text, which is usually plaintext offset in a regular square box at the top, bottom, or sides of a panel.",
        "Your characters might interact with each other directly, or they might set off a chain of events that influence each other.",
        "The distribution of the characters in your panels will depend upon the plot you have decided and how the characters taking part in the action.",
        "Remember to refer to your character sheet when drawing to understand how their bodies and costumes may interact with the environment.",
        "Write dialogue and narrative text.",
        "Now that you have your background and characters in your panels, your stage is set and your players are ready for the story.",
        "You need to write the text of your comic in the remaining space on the page.",
        "This will describe the action and convey the emotions in your simple comic.",
        "Take a look at your list of key words, phrases, and dialogue that you came up with while working on the plot of your simple comic.",
        "Use these as the foundation upon which you build the rest of the scene.",
        "If you can't convey something through dialogue, put it into narrative text.",
        "For example, you could write \u201cJack Smith had a chip on his shoulder all his life.",
        "And now it's time to settle that score.\u201d above the image of Jack saying \u201cI\u2019ll show them all!\u201d\nKeep distance in mind.",

        "Limit the space allowed for the text of each panel to a third.",
        "Complete your final panel.",
        "Your final panel may be a cliffhanger, or it could be the end of the scene, but you\u2019ll need the panel to convey a sense of finality.",
        "You might put the words, \u201cThe End\u201d somewhere in the lower right hand corner of the page as a visual cue to readers that your simple comic is finished.",
        "You could also use a thicker than normal borderline for the panel to give the sense of a hard stop to the scene.",
        "If you really like the idea you\u2019ve been developing, you could write \u201cTo be continued\u201d and turn your comic into a series.",
        "Polish up worthwhile simple comics.",
        "You never know when you're going to find a diamond in the rough among your simple comics.",
        "A strip that you intended to use as practice might turn into a popular strip in its own right!",
