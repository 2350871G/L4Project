You are left with two squares stacked on top of each other. Sew a line running down the rightmost side of these two squares. Then, fold the leftmost square over the square next to it. Sew a line running down the leftmost side of the two squares. When you're done, sew together the two squares that meet in the middle of your row. You should be left with one row, fully sewn together. Repeat this process for the other eight rows. It's important you sew in a straight line when using your machine. One trick to help is to look at the line as it forms instead of your needle. Looking at your needle can result in you losing control of the stitching."
