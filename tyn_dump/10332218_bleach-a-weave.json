                    "description": "For the best results, visit a salon or beauty store to get high quality bleaching products. Choose a 30- to 40-volume developer, which is what you will mix in with the bleach powder. The higher the volume of the developer, the higher its lifting power. If you are looking to just lightly bleach your hair, you could use a 20-volume developer. You can also purchase a bleach kit which comes with all the materials you will need: bleach powder, developer, applicator brush, bowl, and gloves."

Take a few minutes to change into an old shirt and pants that you won\u2019t mind getting bleach on in case you spill or splatter any of the bleaching liquid as you work.

If your powder comes with a scoop, simply use the scoop to measure out twice the amount of developer.

While wearing your gloves, take your bleached weave to the sink and rinse it thoroughly with warm water. Keep rinsing it until all the visible bleaching liquid is gone. Make sure your sink is clean before you rinse your weave out. Have an old towel nearby in case you need to set your weave down at any point. Wash your bleached weave with a neutralizing shampoo.

Apply a toner to eliminate brassy shades and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.
