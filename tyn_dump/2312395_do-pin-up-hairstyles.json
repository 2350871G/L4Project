    "text": " Vaunting Victory Rolls Pump up your hairstyle game and wow your friends with this sexy look perfect for a night out on the town. Whether you dress it up or down with your outfit of choice, victory rolls are ideal for a night of bar-hopping or any fun occasion. Begin by sectioning off your hair. Put up most of your hair in a clip near the crown of your head and slowly work in inch sections to curl your hair. Start in the back and work your way to the front, holding each section of hair on the curling iron for about 45 seconds. Spray with hairspray as you go. Once all of your hair is curled, take your thumb and run it diagonally upward starting from the top of your ear. This will create a chunk of hair for your victory rolls. Take a narrow-toothed comb and tease the chunk of hair by back-combing, starting about  two inches from the roots and combing backward. This creates the illusion of voluptuous hair. Spray with hairspray. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the other side of your head. Make sure the chunk you take from the second side is even in thickness with the first side. Smooth out the top layer using a smoothing comb.  Roll the hair into a small circle about two inches in diameter, starting at the end of the teased chunk of hair and rolling it down to the roots on top of your head. Follow the curl you created with the iron to guide you to a polished look. Pin down the curl in the center of the roll using a bobby pin that matches your hair color. If it seems loose, use more bobby pins to secure the roll. Repeat steps 6 through 8 on the second side. Remember to smooth the teased hair just enough so that it appears healthy but does not lose volume. Spray your whole head with hairspray. Be sure to smooth the front sweep you created with the victory roll using your fingers to hide any loose hairs. Add decorative flowers for a super vintage look. Large flowers work the best with this hairstyle when pinned directly behind either ear. Sporting a Retro Ponytail Sport a retro Ponytail to the office, out for a picnic at the park, or for a daytime date for a playful, flirty look. You can dress it up for a nighttime feel by trying the different variations in steps 10 and 11. Begin by parting your hair from ear to ear, tracing the top of your head to create a front section of hair that would cover your face if you let it fall. Swirl the hair into a little roll just above your forehead and clip it down using any clip you have handy. You'll use this section later on in the steps. Tease the hair you did not just section off with a narrow-toothed comb starting at the crown of your head just back from the part you just created. Start about two inches up from the roots and back-comb your hair down to the roots, creating volume. Work your way down the back of your head, teasing about a three-inch section of hair from your part toward your neck. Make sure to leave a small section of non-teased hair at the base of your head to smooth over the teased section. Pull all of the hair in the back section into a high Ponytail, smoothing the underside with a smoothing brush as you go. Secure the Ponytail with a hair tie as close to the root of the hair as possible. Next, take your front section down and divide it into two smaller sections. Create the part that you want in the front. It can either be a middle part or a side part. Take one section of the front hair and sweep it back to your Ponytail, creating a loose wave on the side of your head. Drape the end of the section over the top of the hair tie and wrap it around the hair tie as many times as necessary for the length of your hair. Secure with a bobby pin underneath the Ponytail. Repeat for the second side. Try to hide the bobby pins as much as possible. You may need to pin on top of the Ponytail as well, but be sure not to disturb the subtle swirl you created. Spray your head with hair spray.  For a fancier feel, you can curl the hair in the Ponytail with a curling iron. If you choose to do so, refrain from using hair spray until after you have curled your hair.

Rocking a Rosie the Riveter Updo Section off your faux bang area. Use a comb to section off a chunk of hair directly above your forehead in a U shape so that you are moving in the direction of ear to ear. The open ends of the U will be in the front of your head and the curved side of the shape will point toward the crown of your head. Pretend that you could draw a line from the edge of your eye up to your hairline and stop gathering hair for this section where the imaginary line and your hair intersect. Clip the hair directly above your forehead. Put the rest of your hair in a high Ponytail in the back of your head using a hair tie. There should be about two to three inches of hair between the edge of the U and the Ponytail. Unclip the front section you created for your faux bang roll. Separate the section into smaller pieces. Using a one-inch curling iron, curl the front section in a backward sweep piece by piece. You want to use a one-inch iron if possible here in order to get the right size roll, but any iron that you have will work. Tease each section of the hair that you just curled using a narrow-toothed comb to back-comb the hair. Start about two inches up from the roots and comb backward. Smooth the outside of the hair that you just teased with a smoothing comb and spray with hair spray. Take the ends of the hair that you curled and begin to roll them down into a big curl directly above your forehead. You can roll the curl straight down or roll it slightly off to the side. Pin the curl with a bobby pin in the center and spray with hair spray.  Next, curl the hair in the Ponytail in small sections.  Keeping the hair in small sections, tease the hair just like you did with the front sections. Remember to comb backwards and smooth the outer hair with a smoothing brush when done. Spray with hair spray and the rest is up to you! You can either leave your poofy pony as is, pin the ends underneath to create a smoother poof, or pin the ends into little ringlets for a dressier feel. To truly look like Rosie the Riveter, add a vintage bandana just behind your front roll. You can either tie the bandana at the base of your head or slightly to the side on top of your head. Finished.
