Any dust, dirt, or debris can made the paint come out muddy, or even prevent it from sticking. Go over the doormat with a stiff brush to loosen any fibers, then vacuum it up. Print or trace your desired letter onto a sheet of cardstock paper. Most monograms are based on the first initial of your first or last name. You can find lots of interesting monograms on the internet, or you can create your own using a word or image editing program. You can also find a large, wooden letter, and trace around it. You can use plastic, store-bought stencils as well. You can also use contact paper or adhesive vinyl. Cut the stencil out. For best results, use a sharp craft blade.
