        "With both switches in the \"off\" position, turn the power back on and check each switch individually.",
        "They should immediately power up the attached appliances.",
        "Turn the power off again and cover all the terminals with electrical tape.",
        "Wrap a piece of electrical tape around all the terminals, protecting them from potential shorts.",
        "Screw in the new light fixture.",
        "With the power still off, place the fixture back on the wall and screw it in with the provided screws.",
        "Turn the power back on and celebrate -- you have a new double switch.",
        "If this is a new fixture, hold it up against the wall and mark the position of the screws with a pencil on the wall.",
        "Using a power drill, make holes where you marked and drill the holes, screwing the light fixture into these holes.",
        "Troubleshooting Turn the power back off before you begin troubleshooting.",
        "If you are removing the fixture or unscrewing anything, be safe and cut the power to the area you are working on.",
        "Use your voltage detector to make sure that there is no power in the switch before proceeding.",
        "Make sure you check the light bulb and appliance before continuing, as the problem may not be with the switch.",
        "Make sure no exposed wires are touching the metal switch box.",
        "This will short the connection and prevent electricity from getting to your light.",
        "Cover up any exposed wire with electrical tape, or trim it and pull more wire through so that there is no excess wire in the switchbox.",
        "Check the connections of the wires.",
        "Most issues are due to a bad or loose connection.",
        "Partially unscrew the feed wire and both neutral wires.",
        "Make sure they are hooked tightly around the screw before tightening them back down.",
        "Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to clamp the ends of the wire around the screw.",
        "Make sure there is enough wire exposed to make a connection with the terminal.",
        "Use a pair of wire strippers to expose at least 1/2-inch of wire.",
        "If the end of the wire is frayed or nicked up, cut it off, strip another inch of insulation off, and use this end.",
        "You have multiple hot feed wires.",
        "This is common with some older boxes, when you have two single switches hooked up instead of one double switch.",
        "A hot wire (red or black) comes out of the wall and into one switch, then out of that switch and into the other one.",
        "It may, in some cases, even return to the wall from the second switch.",
        "Don't let this discourage you -- simply attach the hot wire on the new fixture exactly how you found it on the old wire.",
        "This is why there are often two terminal screws on the feed side.",
        "Some electricians will cut the wire covering in the middle, loop the wire in the terminal, and allow the rest of the wire to continue into the wall.",
        "You should do the same thing if you see this is the case in your old switch.",
        "Make sure that you have the feed wire connected to the right side of the switch.",
        "If checking your connections still doesn't work, you should make sure that the feed wire is in the correct side of the switch.",
        "If your switch does not have it labeled, it is the side with the metal tab, or \"fin.\"",
        "The screws are usually black.",
        "If there are two black terminals on the same side, it does not matter which one you attach the feed to.",
        "If you are still struggling reverse the connections or check the manual included with your new switch.",
        "You don't have a ground wire.",
        "Many older houses won't have feed wires, but this is okay.",
        "The box is grounded to the house already, meaning you won't need one."
