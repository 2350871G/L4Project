Add \u00bd cup (115 g) of granulated white sugar, then stir them together with a fork. Set the bowl aside for later. Toast the sesame seeds in a pan over medium heat for 30 to 45 seconds, then let them cool before using them. Mix the rice flour and water in a separate bowl to make a dough. Place 2 cups (300 g) of glutinous rice flour into a bowl. Add 1 cup (240 mL) of room-temperature water, then stir it in with a whisk. Once the dough comes together, knead it a few times with your hands to form a clump. Form the dough into balls, then flatten them into disks.

Use about 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 g) of dough for each ball. The patties will be about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) wide once you flatten them.

If you flattened the palitaw, pat both sides of each patty into the coconut instead. Transfer the palitaw to a serving platter as you finish coating them in coconut. Work 1 palitaw at a time. Sprinkle the palitaw with a mixture of sugar and toasted sesame. In a small bowl, combine \u00bd cup (115 g) of granulated white sugar with \u00bc cup (36 g) of toasted sesame seeds.
