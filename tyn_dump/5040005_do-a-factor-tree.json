Example: Make a factor tree for the number 315. .....315\n...../...\\ Find a pair of factors. Pick any pair of factors for the number you're working with.

The number 15 also contributes the unshared factor of 3, and the number 40 also contributes the unshared factors of 2, 2, and 2. As such, you must multiply:\n5 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 120 Write your answer. This completes the problem, so you should be able to write down your final answer. Example: The LCM of 15 and 40 is 120.",

        "To find the least common multiple (LCM) between two or more numbers, you need to break down each number in the problem set into its prime factors.",
        "Do so by using the factor tree method.",
        "Create a separate factor tree for each number in the problem set using the method described in the \"Making a Factor Tree\" section.",
        "A multiple is a value that the current number is a factor of.",
        "The LCM is the smallest value that can qualify as a shared multiple of all given numbers in the set.",
        "Example: Find the least common multiple of 15 and 40.",

        "Look at all of the prime number factors of each original value.",
        "Highlight, list, or otherwise identify all of the factors that are shared among each of the factor trees.",

        "Pair off common factors.",
        "For instance, if one number has \u201c2\u201d as a factor twice and the other has \u201c2\u201d as a factor once, you should count the shared \u201c2\u201d as one pair; the remaining \u201c2\u201d of the first number will be counted as an unshared digit.",

        "Once you have separated out each set of shared factors, multiply the shared factor by all of the unshared factors in each tree.",
        "The shared factor is treated as a single number.",
        "The unshared factors are each counted, even if there are multiple occurrences of that digit.",

        "The number 15 also contributes the unshared factor of 3, and the number 40 also contributes the unshared factors of 2, 2, and 2.",
