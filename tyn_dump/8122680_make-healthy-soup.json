Pour 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water and \u00be cups (180 milliliters) of low-sodium chicken broth into a 2 or 3-quart (2 or 3-liter) saucepan, and bring it to a simmer over medium-low heat. Using a low-sodium chicken broth is the first step to creating a healthier chicken soup. Add the chicken breasts, and simmer for 6 minutes, then let it stand off-heat until the chicken is cooked through. Add 1 pound (454 grams) of boneless, skinless chicken breasts into the saucepan, and simmer uncovered for 6 minutes. Next, take the saucepan off the burner, cover it with a lid, and let it stand (off-heat) until the chicken is cooked through. This will take about 15 minutes. The chicken is cooked through when it is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear. Do not undercook the chicken. Take the chicken out of the broth, let it cook, then shred it to smaller pieces. Using a pair of tongs, take the chicken out of the broth, and let it cool on a plate for 10 minutes. Then, using a knife and fork, shred the chicken to \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide, 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long pieces. Set the broth aside for later. Cook the onion in the oil in a separate pot over medium heat until it softens. Peel and chop 1 medium-sized onion, then add it to a heavy-bottomed 4-quart (4-liter) pot with 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of oil. Let the onion cook, stirring occasionally, until it softens. This will take about 6 minutes. Do not let the onion turn brown or caramelize. Add the garlic, then cook for another minute. Peel 1 garlic glove, mince it, then add it to the pot with the onion. Continue cooking, stirring from time to time, until the garlic turns fragrant. This will take about 1 minute. Add the rest of the vegetables and seasoning, then continue cooking until everything turns soft. Cut the carrots and celery into \u2153-inch (0.85-centimeter) thick slices, then add them to the pot. Add \u00bd teaspoon of salt and \u00bc teaspoon of pepper. Cover the pot with a lid, and let the vegetables cook until they turn soft. This will take about 8 to 10 minutes. Give the vegetables a stir every so often so that they don't burn and cook more evenly. Don't worry about cooking the vegetables all the way through. You will continue cooking them in the next step. Add the chicken broth and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Take the water-and-chicken broth mixture from before, and pour it into your saucepan over the vegetables. Give it a stir, then simmer it, covered, over low to medium-low heat until the vegetables turn tender. This will take about 10 minutes. Take the pot off the heat, then add the shredded chicken and chopped parsley. Give everything a stir, then ladle it out into 4 soup bowls and serve. If you have any soup left over, you can store it in the fridge or freezer. Making a Creamy Cauliflower-Potato Soup Heat the shallots and the celery with oil over medium heat for 2 minutes. Finely chop the shallots and celery, then add them to a large saucepan with 2 teaspoons of oil. Cook the shallots and celery over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the cauliflower and potato. Chop off the thick stem and leaves from half a head of cauliflower, then cut it into small florets. Peel and slice the potatoes, then add both into the saucepan. For a twist, use sweet potatoes instead of Yukon gold potatoes. They will give your soup an extra dose of beta-carotene and vitamin A.

Reduce the heat to low, then let the soup simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. You are ready for the next step when the vegetables turn soft and tender. Stir in the lemon juice. It would be best to use freshly-squeezed lemon juice, but if you can't get any, bottled lemon juice is fine. This will help bring out the other flavors in your soup.

        "How much salt and pepper you add is entirely up to you.",

        "Use the condensed soup in your recipe.",
        "This soup is meant to be used as a substitute for canned, condensed soup in dishes such as casseroles and gravies.",

        "Watch the sodium.",
        "Cutting fats and calories are not the only ways to make soup healthier.",

        "Try adding some fresh or dried herbs, such as: cilantro/coriander, ginger, garlic, or pepper.",
        "Spices not only add flavor, but they also contain antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, both of which are beneficial to your health.",

        "Add some vegetables or beans for extra fiber.",
        "Vegetables are a great way of introducing antioxidants, fiber, minerals, and vitamins to your diet.",
        "Beans can add fiber and protein while making your soup thicker.",

        "If your soup recipe calls for pasta, noodles, or rice, try using whole wheat pasta, whole wheat noodles, or brown rice instead.",
        "If you don't like brown rice, you could also try wild rice or pearl barley.",
        "Whole grains are full of beneficial fibers, vitamins, and nutrients.",
        "Go easy on the extras, such as bacon, cheese, and sour cream.",
        "There is nothing wrong with adding a little bit of bacon, cheese, or sour cream to your soup.",
        "Instead of using them in the main body of your soup, however, use them as a topping instead.",
        "This way, you will extra the extra flavor, but not the extra fats and calories.",
        "Here are some other ways you can cut corners while indulging in the goodies:\nUse reduced-fat, finely shredded cheese instead of regular, full-fat shredded cheese.",
        "Love bacon?",
        "Try turkey bacon or chopped up Canadian bacon instead of regular bacon.",
        "Need sour cream?",
        "Try low-fat sour cream or plain, non-fat Greek yogurt.",
