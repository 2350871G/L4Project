        "Check your owner\u2019s manual for specific instructions about removing your hot tub\u2019s cover.",
        "You\u2019ll likely need to unscrew its hinges, so be sure to keep the screws in a safe place until you reinstall it.",
        "Loading the Hot Tub onto a Truck Use furniture dollies to move the tub over flat surfaces.",
        "With helpers at each corner, lift the tub off the ground high enough to slide the 4x4 boards under the tub.",
        "Then slide furniture dollies at the tub's front and back sides.",
        "Make sure the dollies are centered at both ends, then slide the boards out to lower the tub so its base sits flat on the dollies.",
        "If your dollies have straps, secure them to the hot tub.",
        "Slowly push the tub to the moving truck, and keep an eye on the dollies to make sure they don\u2019t slide out of position.",
        "Use an appliance dolly if you have to deal with stairs.",
        "You\u2019ll need at least 2 or 3 people to lift the tub onto its side.",
        "Lift and push up the side opposite the one that will rest on the ground.",
        "Have 2 people on the other side to guide the tub and ensure it doesn\u2019t tip over.",
        "Once the tub is on its side, slide the appliance dolly under it so the base of the tub faces the dolly.",
        "Make sure the side that rests on the ground doesn\u2019t have any access or control panels.",
        "The weight of the tub might damage them.",
        "Wrap the dolly\u2019s straps around the tub and make sure they\u2019re secured tightly.",
        "Then carefully lift the tub and dolly backward to put the weight of the load onto the dolly\u2019s wheels.",
        "Have at least 2 people guide the dolly from the front and 2 from the back.",
        "Go up or down stairs one step at a time, and make sure everyone is ready for the next step before proceeding.",
        "Roll the tub up the truck\u2019s ramp.",
        "Lower the moving truck\u2019s ramp, then line up the wheels of your furniture or appliance dolly with the ramp.",
        "As you roll the tub up the ramp slowly and steadily, make sure it stays balanced.",
        "Have 2 people on either side to make sure it doesn\u2019t tip.",
        "If you\u2019re using an appliance dolly, you\u2019ll have to pull the dolly up the ramp backwards, or so the side of the dolly with the handle goes up the ramp first.",
        "Have 2 people pull from the handle side and 2 to 3 people push from the other side of the tub.",
        "Tie the tub to the inside of the truck.",
        "Cover the tub with moving blankets, and push it so it\u2019s flush with the inside wall of the truck.",
        "Tie it securely with moving straps so it doesn\u2019t jostle around and get damaged during transport.",
        "You\u2019re now ready to head to your new location\u2014drive safely!",
        "If you\u2019re using furniture dollies, leave them in place under the tub.",
        "The weight of the tied-down tub will keep them in place.",
        "If you\u2019re using an appliance dolly, you can keep it strapped to the tub, but you should take precautions to prevent it from damaging the tub during transport.",
        "Slide a blanket between the appliance dolly and the tub, then wrap moving straps around the dolly and tub to secure both to the inside of the truck.",
        "Unloading the Hot Tub Unstrap the tub and remove the moving blankets.",
        "It might seem like you should cover the tub with blankets throughout the entire moving process, but you\u2019re better off using them only when the tub is inside the truck.",
        "Even if they\u2019re taped or tied around the tub, moving blankets are slippery, and you wouldn\u2019t want someone to lose their grip.",
        "Just be careful and proceed slowly if you have to navigate tight spaces.",
        "Roll the tub down the ramp.",
        "After removing the moving straps and blankets, move the tub to the edge of the truck and line the dollies\u2019 wheels up with the ramp.",
        "Slowly roll the tub down the ramp, and make sure it doesn\u2019t start to tip to one side or the other.",
        "Have 2 people guide the tub from either side to keep it balanced.",
        "Maneuver the tub to its new location.",
        "Make your way to the tub\u2019s destination slowly and carefully.",
        "Make sure gates, doors, and other obstacles are opened or out of the way before you start to roll the tub into position.",
        "Go up or down stairs 1 step at a time, if necessary.",
        "If you have to deal with stairs at the new location, position 2 people in front of the tub and have 2 others manage the dolly's handle.",
        "To go up, pull the appliance dolly so the handle side goes up the stairwell first.",
        "When going down, the side of the dolly with the hot tub should go down the stairwell first.",
        "Take it 1 step at a time, and make sure everyone is ready for the next step before moving.",
        "Remove the dollies.",
        "Set up the 4x4 boards where you want to place the tub.",
        "If you're using furniture dollies, lift the tub from the corners, have someone quickly slide them out from under the tub, then lower the tub onto the boards.",
        "If you\u2019re using an appliance dolly, unstrap it, slide it out from under the tub, then carefully lower the tub\u2019s base onto the boards.",
        "You can then lift the tub from its sides and slide out the boards.",
        "The boards will help ensure no one gets their fingers caught when you lower the tub to the ground.",
        "Reinstall the tub.",
        "Give your team a pat on the back\u2014you\u2019re now ready to reinstall the tub!",
        "Clean it, fill it with water, add sanitizing chemicals, and connect it to electricity."
