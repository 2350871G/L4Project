Your scalp will be healthier if it\u2019s protected from the dye with some of its natural oils, and washing the night before you dye will allow those oils to build back up. In addition, most hair dye brands recommend applying the product to dry hair. Some semi-permanent dyes work best on clean hair or even require that you wash your hair right before dyeing it, so read the instructions that came in your box of dye to be sure. If your hair is too dirty, the dye might not be able to penetrate your hair evenly, so don\u2019t try to color your hair if it\u2019s been more than 2-3 days since the last time you washed it."

        "Saturate the roots of your hair first, since they\u2019ll take the longest for the color to develop.",
        "Then, work section by section, coating each piece of hair from the root down to the tips.",
        "If you need to, use your fingers to work the dye into your hair.",
        "Make sure to coat the top and bottom of the underlayer.",
        "Unless your hair is very long, you probably won\u2019t need to use the whole container of dye since you\u2019re just coloring the underlayer.Tip: If you want a 2-tone or dip-dyed effect, paint a darker color onto the tips of your hair first, then add a lighter color on the rest of the underlayer, all the way up to your roots.",
        "Make sure to blend the area where the 2 colors meet to avoid creating a harsh line between the 2 colors.",
        "Wrap a towel around your shoulders and set your timer.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished applying the color to your hair, slip a towel onto your shoulders to protect your skin from the dye.",
        "Read the package instructions to find out how long to leave the dye on, then set your timer and wait.",
        "Don\u2019t pin the colored hair up with the rest of your hair or the dye will transfer.",
        "Do not leave the dye on your hair longer than the instructions recommend!",
        "If you\u2019d like, you can use makeup remover to clean up any dye that got on your skin while you're waiting.",
        "Rinse the dye out with cool water until the water runs clear.",
        "After the timer goes off, rinse your hair in cool water to remove the dye.",
        "Work your fingers through your hair to make sure you don\u2019t miss any spots.",
        "Continue rinsing until the water runs completely clear and you can\u2019t feel any more dye in your hair.",
        "Don\u2019t use any shampoo and avoid using hot water, as these can lift the cuticle on your hair and rinse away the dye.",
        "Apply a deep conditioner to your hair.",
        "If your kit came with a deep conditioner, apply it to your hair and let it sit for the recommended amount of time.",
        "If it didn\u2019t, use your favorite conditioner instead, and leave it on for about 5 minutes before rinsing it away.",
        "Conditioner will smooth your chemically-treated hair and will help seal the cuticle shut, which could help your dye last longer."
