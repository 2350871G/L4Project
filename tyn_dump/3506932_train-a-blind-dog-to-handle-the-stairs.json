        "In this case, provide the treat and praise when its front paws move up to the second step and its rear paws are on the first step.",
        "Lead the dog off the first step using a \u201cstep down\u201d command.",
        "Use the leash to help turn the dog around, then use a \u201cstep down\u201d command and hold out a treat so that the dog must descend the step to reach it.",
        "Give the treat and praise when its front paws touch the floor, then repeat the process to get its back paws off the steps.",
        "Going down the stairs is usually more stressful for a blind dog, since it\u2019s stepping off into empty air and must completely trust you.",
        "Be very patient and enthusiastic.",
        "Continue the process up and down the stairs, at the dog\u2019s pace.",
        "After going up and down a single step, try going up and down 2 steps.",
        "Then, if your dog is still eager and engaged, try 3 steps.",
        "Don\u2019t be surprised if you have to break up the process over several days or even a few weeks, however.",
        "If your dog becomes anxious or resistant to follow your lead or take the treat, stop training for the day and try again the next day.",
        "See if you can add 1-2 steps to your up-and-down climb each day.",
        "Use just verbal commands and praise once it\u2019s mastered the stairs.",
        "After the dog has successfully climbed up and down all the stairs on the staircase with the assistance of treats, try training it without the treats the next day.",
        "Follow the same process, but skip the treats and rely on your \u201cstep up\u201d and \u201cstep down\u201d commands and lots of praise to lead the dog.",
        "As it becomes more familiar and confident with the staircase, you can try using \u201cstep up\u201d when you reach the base of the steps, then praise it after it\u2019s ascended the entire staircase.",
        "Likewise, do the same with \u201cstep down\u201d to descend the stairs.",
        "Depending on your dog, you may need to start training from scratch with each new staircase, or you may be able to skip forward if it\u2019s confident in your lead.",
        "Luring the Dog with Treats on Each Step Place a treat on the back of each stair tread.",
        "With your dog out of the area, place a single treat near the back center of each stair tread going up the staircase.",
        "Using this method, the treats will lure the dog up the steps one-by-one, rather than you leading it up the steps with a leash and treats.",
        "Make sure there are no other dogs around to steal the treats!",
        "Use pieces of kibble as treats or, if your dog likes cheese, tear string cheese into small pieces.",
        "Walk ahead of your dog and say \u201cstep up\u201d at the first step.",
        "Without putting the leash on the dog, stand at the base of the steps and use \u201ccome\u201d or a similar command to draw the dog to you.",
        "Walk up the first step and say \u201ccome\u201d if needed to bring your dog forward.",
        "Then, when it reaches the base of the first step, say \u201cstep up.\u201d\nWhile you won\u2019t be using a leash right away, you may need one if the dog gets anxious part of the way up the steps.",
        "Keep a leash rolled up in your hand or pocket.",
        "This leash-free training method can help a blind dog master a staircase faster, but it works best with dogs that are confident and comfortable following your lead.",
        "If you dog is anxious, training with a leash may work better.",
        "Offer verbal praise when it reaches the first treat.",
        "As soon as the dog ascends the first step and gobbles up the treat, offer enthusiastic praise like \u201cGreat job!\u201d or \u201cWay to go!\u201d You might also pet it on the back if it enjoys that.",
        "Don\u2019t shout your praise so that you startle the dog, but make sure you express some enthusiasm.",
        "You want it to know you appreciate its good work!",
        "Repeat the process up the entire staircase.",
        "Some dogs may move from step to step (and treat to treat) without prompting from you.",
        "In this case, keep walking up the stairs ahead of it and offering praise as it goes.",
        "If your dog needs encouragement to go up each step, repeat the initial process: say \u201cstep up\u201d as you ascend the next step, then praise it as soon as it follows you.",
        "If the dog isn\u2019t interested in continuing, stop the session there and try again the following day.",
        "Consider it progress if it adds 1-2 steps per day.",
        "To end the session, attach the leash and lead the dog down the steps.",
        "Say \u201cstep down,\u201d hold out a treat so it must descend a step to reach it, and offer the treat and praise each time it goes down a step.",
        "Place treats on the fronts of the treads to go downstairs.",
        "Once your dog can readily ascend the staircase, use treats to help lure it down the steps.",
        "Place the treats near the front ledge (but not right on the edge) of each step, so that the dog will have to step down to reach them.",
        "Expect training to go more slowly for downstairs than upstairs.",
        "Your dog is literally putting blind trust in you!",
        "Use \u201cstep down\u201d and praise to guide the dog downward.",
        "Follow the same procedure to lure your dog down the steps: walking ahead, giving a command, and providing verbal praise for each success.",
        "It may take a day, several days, or even a few weeks, but your dog will make it!",
        "Use the leash, commands, treats, and praise to lead your dog down the steps if it loses interest in leash-free training or become too anxious to continue.",
        "Try again the next day.",
        "Practice going up and then down a single staircase at a time.",
        "When your dog masters one staircase, move on to another.",
        "Making Training Easier Train at your dog\u2019s pace, especially if it\u2019s newly blind.",
        "Because their other senses\u2014especially hearing and smelling\u2014are so exceptional, dogs often compensate for blindness quite well.",
        "You may not even realize your dog has gone blind for a while!",
        "However, if its blindness has occurred very recently, and especially if it happened suddenly, plan for a more drawn-out training process.",
        "In addition to the physical adjustments that it has to make, dogs can experience a great deal of anxiety as they lose their sight.",
        "Be patient and compassionate as both of you adjust to this new reality.",
        "Keep your home\u2019s layout consistent.",
        "In some cases, people don\u2019t realize their dog can no longer see until they rearrange their furniture.",
        "By keeping things in their usual places, you make everything comfortably familiar for your dog.",
        "It can also use its other senses to navigate around familiar landmarks more easily.",
        "If you must make some changes\u2014for instance, moving the dog\u2019s bedding and food dish to the first floor since it can\u2019t yet handle the stairs\u2014do the minimum amount necessary.",
        "Use tactile cues (like rugs) to identify staircases.",
        "To help your dog recognize when it\u2019s approaching a staircase, place rugs with specific textures at the top and bottom of the stairs.",
        "You may even want to place one type of rug (for instance, a soft, high-pile rug) at the top of every staircase in your home, and another type (like a firm, low-pile rug) at the bottom of every staircase.",
        "This can reduce any fear your dog might have of stepping off the edge of a staircase without realizing it.",
        "Make sure the rugs have anti-skid backings so they don\u2019t slide out from under your dog\u2019s feet.",
        "Provide scent cues to mark the tops and bottoms of staircases.",
        "Blind dogs usually come to rely even more on their exceptional sense of smell, and you can take advantage of this to help them identify staircases.",
        "Add a small amount of a mild fragrance to the baseboard or stair treads at the top and bottom of the steps.",
        "However, some essential oils, including cinnamon, citrus, pennyroyal, peppermint, pine, sweet birch, tea tree (melaleuca), wintergreen, and ylang ylang, can be toxic to a dog if it ingests it or gets it on its skin.",
        "Talk to your vet about which essential oils may be used around your dog.",
        "You might use one scent for the tops of all your staircases, and another scent for the bottoms.",
        "This is also a good way to help blind dogs identify doorways, furniture, and so on.",
        "Don\u2019t underestimate your blind dog!",
        "While it can be devastating to find out that your beloved dog is losing its sight, don\u2019t fall into the trap of assuming that it can no longer lead a happy life.",
        "Dogs are resilient, adaptable, and naturally less reliant on their sense of sight than humans are.",
        "With a bit of training and some minor adjustments to your routines, you can live many more happy years with your canine pal!"
