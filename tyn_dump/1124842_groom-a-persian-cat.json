                    "description": "Nail clippers for cats look like scissors at first glance but have a specially curved edge to accommodate feline claws. Buy them in any pet supply store. Because Persians are large cats, you might have to buy slightly larger clippers. Ask a staff member for assistance. Never use scissors or anything with a straight blade. This can be extremely uncomfortable, if not painful. Keep styptic powder on hand, just in case you accidentally clip the nail too short or if it starts bleeding."

Keep a gentle hold of the paw while allowing your cat to guide the motion. After they calm down, massage toe and give it a gentle squeeze. You will see a claw emerge. Give your cat a treat for their cooperation. Practice this on a different toe every other day until your cat gets used to it. Get your cat used to the sound of clippers by practicing on an uncooked piece of pasta. Sit near your cat, put the noodle in the clippers, and trim it. Let your cat sniff the clippers if they want. Get to the point where you can massage and gently squeeze the toe while you clip the pasta. Always reward your cat with a treat after each practice session."
