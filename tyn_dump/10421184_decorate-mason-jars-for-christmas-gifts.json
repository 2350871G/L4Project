Write a Christmas greeting on it, then decorate it with Christmas-themed washi tape and stickers. Wrap it around your jar, then overlap the ends in the back and glue them in place. Add a strip of double-sided tape to the back of the label first so that it doesn't slide off the jar. You can also design the label on the computer, or print a template off of the internet instead. \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d is a popular greeting, but you can also use \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d and \u201cSeason\u2019s Greetings\u201d instead.

Choose a festive ribbon the same width as the jar lid, then hot glue it around the lid, overlapping the ends by \u20442 in (1.3 cm). Red, green, or white are classic colors, but you can use others too. Blue is perfect for a Winter Wonderland theme, while silver or gold will look more elegant. If you can't find ribbon, use washi tape instead! It comes in all sorts of colors and patterns, and you can find it in the scrapbooking section of a craft store. You can do one or the other, or even both! Leaving the lid unpainted will give you a rustic touch. The ribbon needs to cover the sides on the jar lid. If it's too wide, it will stick out over the top edge of the jar, but it it's too narrow, you'll see the sides of the lid."
