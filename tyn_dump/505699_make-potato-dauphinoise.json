Place them on a chopping board and use a sharp knife to slice the potatoes as thinly as you can, around 4 millimetres (0.16 in) thick. Set the sliced potatoes aside.

Place it over a low heat and leave it to simmer while you prepare the rest of the dish. Some recipes will call for different ratios of milk and cream to achieve different results. Use 400 millilitres (14  fl oz) of cream for an even richer dish, or try 200 millilitres (6.8  fl oz) each of milk and cream for something a little simpler. For extra flavor, simmer your milk and cream with some aromatics. Try adding in some bay leaves, a few whole cloves, or maybe even a cinnamon stick while the mixture simmers for some deeper, albeit non-traditional, flavors."

Use the exposed end of the garlic clove to begin rubbing down a large baking dish, covering the entire surface with garlic. A slight film or sheen should form over the baking dish, imparting a subtle garlic flavor. The baking dish for a serving of this size should be around 13 by 9 inches (33 by 23 cm). Adjust the size of the dish to the number of potatoes you are using, and use only enough garlic to rub down the dish. While this will only give your dish a slight garlic flavor, you can skip this step if you don\u2019t like the taste of garlic."
