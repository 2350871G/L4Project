Use your fingers to gently twist both ends of the ring back toward each other, until they are brought together. Make sure the ends are brought as close as possible. This will keep the hoop secure, and the edges of the ends from scraping your nose. Using Segment Rings Push the segment to the side. The segment is held in place with prongs and pressure.
