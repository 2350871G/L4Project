Check to see which places on the shoe aren\u2019t touching your foot, and decide which parts need to be smaller for the shoes to fit more snugly. If you bought the shoe in your size, you probably won\u2019t need to shrink the entire shoe. Instead, you\u2019re just going to be focusing on shrinking one area of the shoe at a time. For instance, you may want to make the sides of a canvas shoe slightly smaller so your foot doesn\u2019t slip out while you walk."
