        "Thread the new spoke through the holes onto the rim.",
        "Put the threaded end of the spoke through the hole closest to the center of the wheel.",
        "Look at the pattern of your spokes to see if the new spoke needs to go over or under other spokes while you\u2019re threading it in.",
        "Guide the threaded end of the spoke through the hole on the outside of the rim.",
        "You can buy new spokes from bike repair shops or sporting goods stores.",
        "Make sure the spoke you have is the same length and style as the old one or else it won\u2019t fit your bike properly.",
        "Screw the spoke nipple onto the threaded end of the spoke.",
        "Feed the threaded end of the spoke onto the nipple and guide the nipple through the hole in the rim.",
        "Rotate the nipple clockwise by hand to tighten it and secure it to the spoke.",
        "Once the nipple is hand-tight, use a screwdriver to spin it a quarter turn so you don\u2019t overtighten it.",
        "Use the spoke nipple from the old spoke so you don\u2019t have to buy a new one.",
        "Tighten the spoke nipple with a spoke wrench to add tension to it.",
        "Grip the end of the spoke nipple sticking out from the rim with your spoke wrench and rotate it clockwise to tighten it.",
        "Compare the tension on the new spoke with the other spokes near it and keep adjusting until they feel the same.",
        "You can also grab the spoke directly if it\u2019s easier than the spoke nipple.",
        "Put the rim tape, tube, and tire back onto the bike.",
        "Apply a layer of rim tape around the outside of the rim so the ends of the spokes don\u2019t damage the tube and tire.",
        "Slightly inflate the tube before threading it into the tire.",
        "Line up the valve stem on the tire with the hole on the rim and push the tire and tube back onto the wheel.",
        "Inflate the tube again to secure it in place.",
