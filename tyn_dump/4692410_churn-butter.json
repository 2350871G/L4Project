                    "description": "It is possible to make a butter churner, if you're good with wood, cutting and improvising. The simplest version is to make an \"up and down churn\", which consists of a dash (small dowel or similar) inserted into a jar through the lid and then moved up and down. A more complex paddle churn can made using a jar or coffee can with a lid, through which you push various pieces of dowel and rig them up to a small wheel for turning. Look online for a suitable pattern. Use your electric beater (such as the ubiquitous KitchenAid mixer). Depending on the motor quality, this might require turning on and off, to give the motor a break but some of the newer, heavier-duty ones should be able to cope. It's a good idea to cover the mixer with a tea towel, to prevent the cream from spattering upward when \"churning\"."
