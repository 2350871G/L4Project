Here are some ideas to get you started:\nFor a tapering spill, have it start the same width as the container opening, then make it get wider and wider further out. This works best for vases. For a short spill, try having something that's curved, like a puddle of spilt milk. A long spill would look great along a fence or wall. Have it run for several yards/meters before running into a rock, pond, or other fixture. Work with your landscape. If you want a wavy spill, have it wind around rocks and other pots that might be in its path. Combine straight spills with tapering spills. You can have them grow wider or narrower the further they are from the container. This will make them look more interesting."
