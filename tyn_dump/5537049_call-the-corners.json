        "Use them to create a circle around you while you work.",
        "For instance, place a feather toward the east to represent air, a red candle toward the south to represent fire, a bowl of water in the west to represent water, and a bowl of salt in the north to represent earth.",

        "Hold your hand over the salt water and imagine a white light flowing into the water.",
        "Then, sprinkle the water around the circle.",
        "As you cleanse the space, you might prefer to say something, such as \u201cWith this sage, I banish all negativity!\u201d Light the candles around the perimeter of your circle, if you're using them.",
        "It's up to you if you want to mark your circle with candles.",
        "You might enjoy the ambiance of the candles.",
        "However, they can pose a fire risk and may be unsafe if you have children or pets in your home.",
        "You can also mark your circle with non-flammable items, like seashells or stones.",
        "Walk around your circle clockwise 3 times to cast your circle.",

        "Calling the Elements Begin in the north or east, depending on your preference.",
        "You may start in the north because it represents earth, which means it provides a stable foundation for your magical work.",
        "Alternatively, you might start in the east because it's where the sun rises.",
        "Choose what feels right to you, or follow your traditions if you're learning a formal practice.",
        "It's helpful to follow your own intuitions and do what's right for you.",

        "Call each corner using your quarter calls.",
        "Turn toward the direction you are calling, then use a confident voice to recite the words you wrote or borrowed.",

        "You may write your calls into your Book of Shadows, if you have one.",
        "Then, you might prefer to read them from the book as part of your ritual.",
        "Remember to turn to the next direction before making your next quarter call.",
        "Light the candles associated with each corner, if you're using them.",
        "After each call, light the candle that represents that element, if you're using corresponding candles.",
        "Use a lighter, match, stick of incense, or another candle.",
        "Later, you'll extinguish these candles when you release the corners.",
        "Stand in the center and acknowledge your goddess, god, or spirit.",
        "You can simply acknowledge their presence or call them to your circle, depending on your beliefs.",
        "Some practitioners appeal to the goddess, god, or spirit in general.",
        "However, you can also call on specific deities, if you'd like.",
        "You might skip this step if it doesn't fit into your spiritual path.",
        "You might say\u2026\n\u201dDearest goddess, thank you for being in my circle.\u201d\n\u201dGreat goddess, I call to you, be with me here in my circle.\u201d\n\u201dOh, great goddess, come to me, hear my words, and make them be.\u201d\n\u201dI call on these, Brigid, to come to my circle.\u201d"
