If your start-up expenses exceed $55,000, you won\u2019t be able to claim the $5,000 deduction for the first year. For example, if start-up or organizational costs are $51,000, your deduction is reduced to $4,000. If start-up or organizational costs are $55,000 or more, the $5,000 deduction is completely phased out for the first year.

Whatever portion of your startup costs that you can't deduct during the first year can be deducted over the next 180 months of operation, starting with the month after you started your business. Organizational costs appear on the income statement as an expense if deducted or on the balance sheet as an asset that will be amortized (expensed or deducted from income)over a period of years."
