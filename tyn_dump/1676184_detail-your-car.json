Then, use the vacuum\u2019s broad heads to clean the floor beneath the carpet. Finally, use narrow heads to vacuum up debris stuck between the seats. A wet/dry vacuum is the best tool for the job since it exerts plenty of suction power and comes with a variety of heads that will allow you to vacuum the carpets, doors, door handles, cup holders, and other surfaces within your car.

Also, spray the interior of the rear window and windshield with the cleaner. Use a clean cotton rag to wipe the solution across the window surfaces to clean them.

Rather than leaving them dirty, grab a handful of cotton swabs and start cleaning out the nooks and crannies. Dry cotton swabs should easily pick up most of the dust and dirt that\u2019s worked its way into small crevasses in the vehicle\u2019s dashboard and seats.

If you have cloth seats, spray them with a foaming aerosol cleaner. Let the spray sit for about 30 minutes and vacuum the fabric seats clean to remove dust and dirt. You can also purchase leather cleaning wipes or spray at a large supermarket. Auto supply stores should also sell foaming aerosol cleaners for cloth seats. Never use a cleaning product not intended for leather on leather seats."

If there are hard-to-reach spots in the wheel arches that you can\u2019t quite clean out with a sponge, use an old toothbrush instead.

Work over the entire car\u2019s body with a dry, clean cloth. This should buff out any smears and leave the bodywork looking shiny and fresh. At this point, your car should appear as if it\u2019s ready for a showroom floor.

        "Park your car on a flat outdoor surface.",
        "While it\u2019s possible to detail your car while it\u2019s parked in a garage, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s more room to move around the vehicle if it\u2019s parked outside.",
        "Situate the car on a level area so you\u2019ll have easy access to all sides of the vehicle.",
        "To avoid full sun, park under a tree or in another shady location.",
        "For example, park the car in your driveway or in an infrequently used cul-de-sac.",
        "Fill a plastic bucket with water and automotive soap.",
        "It\u2019s important that you use a soap specifically designed for vehicles and not, for example, dishwashing detergent.",
        "Pour automotive soap into a large plastic bucket as directed on the label.",
        "Then, using an outdoor hose, add water to the bucket until it\u2019s roughly 3/4 full.",
        "Carefully carry the bucket to your vehicle\u2019s location, taking care not to spill any of the soap solution.",

        "Take a large vehicle sponge and submerge it in the soapy water.",
        "Scrub it across surfaces of your car in long, lengthwise strokes, making sure to remove all of the caked-on dirt and grime.",
        "If you\u2019re working outdoors on a hot day, spray your car down with a hose before applying soap.",
        "This will keep the paint wet and prevent the suds from drying in the sun\u2019s heat.",
        "Work section by section from the top of your car downward, so that you don\u2019t end up cleaning any of the same sections twice.",
        "Wash the windows, doors, roof, hood, fenders, and rear of the vehicle.",
        "Rinse the car with a hose once you\u2019ve finished washing it.",
        "As soon as all of the sections of the car are clean, use your hose to spray a generous amount of water over the car\u2019s body.",
        "Be sure not to let the soap dry on the car before you rinse it off, or it will leave unsightly residue marks across the vehicle.",
        "If you\u2019re working on a warm day and are worried that the soap may dry on washed sections before you\u2019ve had a chance to finish washing the whole car, rinse the car section by section.",
        "Scrub the mirrors and door handles clean with a stiff-bristle brush.",
        "Dip the brush into the bucket of soapy water and then set to work cleaning out hard-to-reach nooks in the exterior of your car.",
        "Scrub inside of the insets around your headlights and taillights, under door handles, and inside the side mirrors.",
        "Rinse off the brush as necessary to keep it from getting filled up with grime.",
        "While a toothbrush would suffice in a pinch, its bristles won\u2019t be tough enough to scrub out caked-on grime.",
        "Wash the wheels and wheel arches with a wheel cleaning spray.",
        "Purchase a wheel and tire cleaning spray from your local auto supply store.",
        "As directed on the packaging, apply the shine spray to the wheel surfaces and let it sit and soak in as directed on the spray container.",
        "While the spray is soaking on 1 wheel, walk around your car and spray wheel cleaner on the other 3 wheels.",
        "Then, use a clean sponge to scrub the wheels until all traces of dirt, mud, and grime are gone.",
        "Rinse the sponge out with water as needed between wheels.",
        "If there are hard-to-reach spots in the wheel arches that you can\u2019t quite clean out with a sponge, use an old toothbrush instead.",
        "Once the wheels and arches are clean, dry off the wheels and wheel arches with a damp sponge and buff with a dry cloth.",
        "Dry off the car with a clean chamois cloth.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished washing the entire surface of your car, dry it by hand before the water evaporates on its own.",
        "Use a microfiber cloth to dry off the windows, doors, hood, trunk, and all other surfaces of the vehicle.",
        "An efficient hand-drying will leave the car free of smears.",
        "If any of the car\u2019s surfaces have dried on their own, give them a quick blast with the hose, then hand dry the area.",
        "This will prevent the dried car from having any unsightly patches.",
        "Clean the car\u2019s windows with auto window cleaner.",
        "Start by spraying a generous coating of the window-cleaner spray onto all of the vehicle\u2019s external glass surfaces.",
        "Then, take a new sponge and wash the exterior of the car\u2019s windows until all traces of dirt are gone.",
        "Be sure to also wash the windshield and rear window.",
        "Then, roll down the door windows about 3 inches (7.6 cm) and use the sponge to wash the tops of the glass.",
        "Apply a generous coating of car cleaner wax to the outside surfaces.",
        "Cleaner waxes will both wax and polish your vehicle.",
        "Once your car has been washed, a cleaner wax product will both polish and wax the outer surfaces.",
        "Follow the instructions on the bottle and apply the product with a clean rag.",
        "Car polish keeps a good sheen on the car, even in dry, dusty and wet weather.",
        "The wax component of the product will guard the car\u2019s paint from UV rays and small stones.",
        "Using a cleaner wax product saves you from having to polish and wax your car separately.",
        "Purchase a cleaner wax product at any automotive supply store.",
        "Buff the entire car with a clean, dry cloth or chamois.",
        "Don\u2019t buff the car while it\u2019s dry, as you might end up scratching the paint.",
        "So, make sure there\u2019s still some wet polish on the car before you begin buffing.",
        "Rub the metal surfaces with small, circular strokes to smear the cleaner wax across the vehicle.",
        "Work over the entire car\u2019s body with a dry, clean cloth.",
        "This should buff out any smears and leave the bodywork looking shiny and fresh.",
        "At this point, your car should appear as if it\u2019s ready for a showroom floor.",
        "For a professional level-buff you can rent or purchase a rotary buffing tool from a hardware store and use it to buff the car and smooth out its paint."
