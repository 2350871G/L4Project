        "Use a flat-head screwdriver to loosen this screw slightly, without unscrewing and removing it completely.",
        "Separate the wire from the circuit breaker once the screw is loose enough.",
        "Always keep track of loose wires, as they can be incredibly dangerous.",
        "Tuck the wire into the circuit breaker box to keep it out of the way.",
        "Make sure you know which wire you have disconnected, as you\u2019ll need to reconnect it when you install a new circuit breaker.",
        "Note the exact amperage and type of the circuit breaker.",
        "The circuit breaker replacement will need to be the exact same type as the faulty one you remove.",
        "Take note of the amperage of the fault breaker, as well as any codes or numbers written elsewhere on it.",
        "Dispose of the faulty circuit breaker.",
        "While a circuit breaker may feel heavy, there is very little value to any of its components.",
        "You can throw circuit breakers away with your regular trash, as they are inert without a power supply.",
        "Installing a New Circuit Breaker Find a new circuit breaker of the same type as the faulty one.",
        "The new circuit breaker will need to be exactly the same type as the one you are replacing.",
        "Your local hardware store should have a selection of circuit breakers and may have the exact one you are looking for.",
        "If not, feel free to ask the staff if they can get one in for you, or if there is one you may have missed.",
        "If the circuit breaker you are replacing is a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) or AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) breaker, as sometimes used for outdoor, bedroom, garage, kitchen or bathroom circuits, be sure that you replace it with another one of the same type.",
        "Clip the new circuit breaker in place.",
        "Using the opposite motion to removing the faulty breaker, firmly clip your new circuit breaker into place.",
        "Position the end without a screw under the hook on the breaker box panel, and pivot the breaker down until it clicks into place securely.",
        "Reattach the loose wire.",
        "Firmly hold your circuit breaker and connect the wire to the loose screw.",
        "Keeping it in place, tighten the screw until it securely holds the wire.",
        "It may help to use a pair of needle-nose pliers to hold the wire in place as you tighten the screw.",
        "While the screw should be tight, you do not need to over-tighten it.",
        "Make sure it is secure, but don\u2019t risk squeezing the wires to the point of damage.",
        "Make sure the rubber insulation on the wire does not touch the screw or the circuit breaker, as it may be damaged or melt over time.",
        "Reattach the faceplate.",
        "Carefully lift the faceplate in line with the breaker box and install it back in place.",
        "Using the same screws that came out of the faceplate, tightly secure the faceplate to the rest of the breaker box.",
        "Always use a screw of the same length and type when reattaching the faceplate.",
        "If the screws are too long or have a pointed end like wood screws, they may screw in too deep and damage the wiring.",
        "Turn the power back on.",
        "If you have a main breaker box, turn on the power to your branch breaker box first.",
        "Turn on the main power in the breaker box, followed by each circuit breaker one by one.",
        "You should start getting power back to your home."
