        "If you have a large house or family, more than 4-5 people, consider making extra kits and leaving them in different sections of the house.",
        "Purchase enough emergency food and water for at least three days.",

        "You should preferably have one for each individual in the house.",
        "Get a portable, battery-operated radio as well.",
        "There are some models that are solar or kinetically powered that may be worth an investment as you'll never have to worry about batteries.",
        "You should also purchase glow-sticks, matches, and candles as backup options.",
        "Create a First Aid kit.",
        "This is one of the most important objects in your emergency kit, and needs to be fully stocked with the following.",

        "Luckily, these sorts of injuries can be prevented with some forethought:\nFasten all shelves securely to the walls.",

        "Standard steel brackets are fine and easy to apply.",
        "Place large, heavy objects on lower shelves or on the floor.",
        "They might fall during an earthquake and the less distance they have to fall, the better.",
        "You can also screw objects onto things, such as a desk.",
        "Use non-slip mats to prevent objects with a low center of gravity from sliding.",
        "For example, fish bowls, vases, floral arrangements, statues, etc.",
        "Use an invisible nylon cord to secure tall, heavy items that can topple over to the wall.",

        "Heavy pictures, light fixtures, and mirrors should be hung away from beds, couches, and anywhere that someone might sit.",
        "Conventional picture hooks will not hold pictures during an earthquake, but they are easy to fix - simply push the hook closed, or use a filler material to fill the gap between the hook and its backing.",
        "Other alternatives include buying special art hooks and ensuring that heavy paintings have adequate, strong hooks and cord.",
        "Check that your house is up-to-date with earthquake protections.",
        "A landlord or your local zoning board can help you determine this.",

        "You can use existing holes, or make loops from leather, that can be glued onto an appliance.",
        "Work with your community to prepare for earthquakes together.",
        "If there aren't civic groups present in your area focused on earthquake preparedness, work on creating one.",
