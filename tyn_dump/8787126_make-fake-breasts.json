        "Pull the pantyhose taut over the breast so that there are no gaps.",
        "It will look sheer, but that's fine.",
        "Hot glue will work especially well for this step because of how fast it sets up.",
        "Start working at one end of the pantyhose.",
        "This way, you may have enough left over to cover the other breast.",
        "Trim off the excess pantyhose with fabric scissors.",
        "Wait for the glue to dry first, if necessary, then flip the breast cup over.",
        "Trim off the excess pantyhose as close to the glue line as you can.",
        "When you are done, repeat the entire process for the other breast cup.",
        "If you have enough pantyhose leftover from the first breast cup, you can use it for the second one.",
        "Make sure that the bra cup doesn't show through, however.",
        "Save the remaining pantyhose sheets for later.",
        "Assembling the Chest Plate Trace the upper part of a t-shirt onto a sheet of white craft foam.",
        "Tuck the sleeves inside the shirt first, so that you have nice, curved edges for the arm holes.",
        "Place the shirt on top of the craft foam.",
        "Trace around the shirt, including the arm holes, stopping a few inches below each arm pit.",
        "This will be the base for your chest plate.",
        "If you can't find craft foam, thin, flexible cardboard may also work.",
        "Make sure it's white.",
        "Stay on the safe side, and add a few extra inches to the top of the shoulders.",
        "Cut the chest plate out.",
        "Test it over your own chest.",
        "The top edges should wrap over your own shoulders.",
        "The bottom edge should extend a few inches past your armpit.",
        "Don't worry about it wrapping all the way around your torso.",
        "Glue the breast cups to the bottom of your chest plate.",
        "Make sure that the breast cups are touching each other in the middle (this forms the cleavage).",
        "The top edges of the breast cups should be just below the arm pit of the chest plate.",
        "The bottom edges will likely hang over the bottom edge of the chest plate.",
        "The thinner part of the breasts should be pointing upwards.",
        "The thicker, fuller part should be pointing downwards.",
        "Trim off the excess chest plate behind the breast cups.",
        "Once the glue dries, flip the chest plate over.",
        "Trim off the excess chest plate until you can see the entire inside of each breast cup again.",
        "This will make the breasts more comfortable to wear, especially if you are a girl.",
        "Finishing the Cosplay Breasts Glue pantyhose sheets across the breasts.",
        "Drape a pantyhose sheet lengthwise across the breasts.",
        "Find the center of the top, long edge, and glue it to center of your chest plate's neck.",
        "Just a drop will do.",
        "Stretch the bottom edge of the pantyhose sheet across the bottom edge of both breasts and glue it to the inside edge of each breast.",
        "For a neater finish, glue the pantyhose to the underside of the collar, not the front.",
        "Start with the outer edges first, then work your way to the bottom and inner (cleavage) edges.",
        "Hot glue is recommended for this section because of how fast it sets up.",
        "Continue wrapping the pantyhose around the breasts.",
        "Working a little bit at a time, wrap the pantyhose around the outer edge of the chest plate and glue it to the underside.",
        "Make sure that you cover the entire collar, shoulders, arm holes, and sides.",
        "The covering will be very sheer, and the chest plate may warp.",
        "This is fine.",
        "Add five more layers of pantyhose.",
        "Using the same technique as before, add five more layers pantyhose sheets to your breasts and chest plate.",
        "Make sure that you have no gaps or holes showing, otherwise the skin tone will be uneven.",
        "With each layer that you add, you may notice the color getting darker and more consistent.",
        "Add structure or support to the back of the chest plate.",
        "The pantyhose covering will likely cause the chest plate to curve or warp.",
        "Flip the chest plate over, and measure from the top of one shoulder down to the top of one breast.",
        "Cut a piece of thin cardboard according to that measurement, then glue it to the back of the chest plate.",
        "Make sure that it's not visible from the front.Repeat this step for the other shoulder and breast.",
        "You can also use plastic boning, featherlight boning, or thermoplastic/worbla.",
        "Glue elastic to the shoulders and sides of the chest plate.",
        "Cut 4 equal lengths of elastic.",
        "Hot glue 2 of the pieces to each shoulder of the chest plate.",
        "Hot glue the other 2 pieces to the sides of the chest plate, right below the arm pits.",
        "If your costume will be light colored, use white elastic.",
        "If you are female, you can glue an old bra inside the chest plate.",
        "Add small backpack buckles or Velcro to the end of each elastic.",
        "You can use hot glue, but sewing the elastic to the buckles or Velcro would be better.",
        "You will be crossing the left shoulder elastic to the right chest elastic, and the right shoulder elastic to the left chest elastic.",
        "If you need to, trim and cut the elastic first so that it is short enough to do this.",
        "If you are using an old bra, you can skip this step.",
        "Try on the chest plate.",
        "Place the chest plate over your chest.",
        "Cross the elastics across your back in an X-shape and snap (or Velcro) them together.",
        "Put on your costume, and adjust it until it rests over the fake breasts naturally.",
        "If you need to, use makeup to help match your skin tone to the breasts.",
        "You can also get clever with carefully-placed accessories, such as scarves, collars, or necklaces.",
        "If you attached the chest plate to an old bra, then put it on like a bra."
