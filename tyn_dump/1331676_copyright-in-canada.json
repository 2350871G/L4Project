If you have created commercial branding or a new invention, rather than a creative work, you may need to apply for a trademark or a patent, rather than a copyright. Copyright covers original artistic work (musical, artistic, literary, or dramatic) and gives the work\u2019s creator the exclusive legal right to reproduce and perform the work. Trademarks are designed to protect commercial brands; they limit use of specific words and designs which describe a specific brand. Patents protect the development of new technology, or improvements made to already existing technologies. A patent limits production and sales of an invention."
