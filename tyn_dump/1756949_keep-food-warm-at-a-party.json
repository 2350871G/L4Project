The downside of using a slow cooker is that you need to have an electrical outlet handy. Make sure you have an open outlet in an out of the way spot.

        "Instead of putting the food in a compartment, you set the food in a dish on top of the tray.",
        "Warming trays are often smaller than chafing dishes, so unless you serve smaller quantities of food, they\u2019re a better option for sides and appetizers like small portions of meat, potatoes, and vegetables than entrees and liquid dishes.",
        "Plug in a hot plate if you have a single dish to keep warm.",
        "Hot plates, like you may have used in science class, are useful for heating food in batches.",
        "Hot plates are relatively small and most of them are electric.",
        "Place something like a bowl of potatoes on the burner, then turn its dial to a low temperature to preserve it.",
        "Some heating plates have 2 burners, allowing you to heat up multiple dishes at once.",
        "They still don\u2019t offer a lot of space for each dish, so keep that in mind when planning your party.",
        "Microwavable hot plates are also available.",
        "Heat them in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, then set food on top of them.",
        "Storing Food in Heat-Preserving Containers Cover open containers thoroughly with tin foil.",
        "No matter how you serve food, it will lose heat when exposed to open air.",
        "Wrap dishes tightly in foil until you\u2019re ready to serve the food.",
        "Put the foil back into place when nobody needs to access the food.",
        "Thicker layers of foil keep the food warmer for longer.",
        "Cover dishes with a few layers of foil to trap in heat.",
        "Use heat-insulated serving dishes to preserve food for longer.",
        "Heavier dishes keep food warmer than thinner dishes.",
        "Ceramic and clay dishes are some of the best options available.",
        "Reserve your best serving dishes for any hot food you plan on serving at the party.",
        "Heavier, thicker dishes retain more heat but also tend to cook food faster.",
        "Use dishes carefully to prevent food from overcooking.",
        "Store liquids in insulated bottles before serving them.",
        "Cook a soup or gravy ahead of time, then pour it into a coffee thermos.",
        "When you need to serve it, pour it out directly from the bottle.",
        "A quality bottle keeps liquids warm for long periods of time.",
        "They are easy to carry around and you can always pour the liquid into another serving container as needed.",
        "If you leave food in a bottle, consider labeling it so guests know what they\u2019re getting.",
        "Put food in insulated food carrying bags for short-term storage.",
        "Insulated bags are what pizza parlors use to deliver food to customers.",
        "Get the food as hot as possible, then slide the container inside the bag.",
        "Bags keep food warm for up to a few hours and they're highly portable.",
        "Carrying bags come in a variety of sizes.",
        "Some are as small as lunchboxes.",
        "Others are made to store casserole dishes and even have pouches that provide separate space for cold dishes.",
        "Use coolers to trap heat when transporting foods.",
        "Coolers are good for more than carrying drinks.",
        "Wash some towels in a hot water cycle in the dishwasher, then roll them up and set them in the cooler.",
        "Place the food inside the cooler and cover it with another layer of warm towels.",
        "You don\u2019t need the towels to use a cooler.",
        "Well-covered food will stay warm, but the towels help trap heat in the food you need to store for up to a few hours.",
        "Another option is to wrap bricks in foil.",
        "Heat them for 2 hours in an oven set to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C).",
        "Then, set them on top of the first layer of towels to provide extra heat.",
        "Reheating Food and Plates Reheat meat dishes in the oven for up to 30 minutes.",
        "Place the meat in a roasting pan and add about 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water or stock.",
        "Cover the pan completely with foil to trap in the heat and moisture.",
        "Then, turn the oven to about 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and heat the food until it\u2019s warm again.",
        "This is a good way to reheat pre-cooked meats.",
        "For example, add warm turkey stock to turkey breast and heat it for about 30 minutes.",
        "For fish and smaller cuts of meat, you don\u2019t need to add water or stock.",
        "Set them in the pan and heat them until fully warmed (about 15 to 20 minutes).",
        "Side dishes like vegetable trays and casseroles can be heated in the oven the same way.",
        "Leave them in at  350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for about 15 minutes.",
        "Simmer soups and liquids on the stove if they begin to cool.",
        "Pour the food from a serving bowl into a saucepan.",
        "Turn the stove to a medium heat setting and wait for the liquid to begin to bubble slightly.",
        "Keep stirring it to prevent it from boiling and overheating.",
        "Side dishes like mashed potatoes are a little trickier to heat up this way.",
        "Add milk or broth to bring the food to the consistency you desire, then keep stirring it until it\u2019s hot.",
        "Microwave smaller sides that don\u2019t need to be crisped.",
        "Smaller quantities of food and sides like vegetables, potatoes, and macaroni and cheese do well in the microwave.",
        "Move them into a microwave-safe dish.",
        "Loosely cover the dish with its lid or plastic wrap.",
        "Reheat the food for about 4 minutes, then take it out and stir it.",
        "Heat it for another 3 minutes until it reaches 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C).",
        "Microwaves heat food unevenly, so you need to monitor the food\u2019s temperature.",
        "Heat the food in slow bursts, stirring it each time to help it warm up evenly.",
        "Microwave are not a good choice for most meat.",
        "They tend to turn meat flabby and gray.",
        "They also cannot crisp up food like fries.",
        "Warm your plates before serving food on them.",
        "If you have an electric plate warmer or an accessible oven, store serving plates in it.",
        "Heat the plates at a temperature of 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) for about 15 minutes.",
        "Warm plates heat up food a little, causing slightly cooled food to still taste great.",
        "Put thick, dishwasher-safe plates in the dishwasher to heat them.",
        "Leave clay plates in for up to 2 hours to ready them for the party.",
        "Use a heating pad if you need to keep served plates of food warm.",
        "If you are short on heating options, set an electric heating pad between towels or heat-resistant mats.",
        "Plug the heating pad into a wall outlet, then set the serving tray on top of it.",
        "It\u2019s a good way to keep plates of food warm after you serve them, including larger dishes like sliced ham or turkey.",
        "Electric blankets work similarly to heating pads.",
        "Plug them into the wall and let them heat up to spread more warmth to your food.",
        "Heated gel packs are another option.",
        "Warm them up in a microwave according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, then place them under plates of food."
