If you already have hinges installed on your shed, you can skip this step. Screw the hinges into the shed with 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) lag screws. Screw in 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) lag screws into the holes on the hinge and into the frame itself. This should secure the hinges to your shed. Line the door up into the doorframe. Have a friend help you hold the door in place. Use a level to make sure that the door is straight, then open the hinge so that it rests over the surface of your door.

While your friend continues to the hold the door in place, use a screwdriver to drive 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) lag screws through the holes in the top hinge and into the door. Then, repeat the process with the bottom hinge. Make sure that the screws are tight and the door feels secured to the shed\u2019s door frame. Open and close your door to test if it works. You should now have a door that can open and close on your shed. If the door is getting stuck on the frame when you try to open it, you may have to sand down the edges of the door with a 36 to 100 grit sandpaper to slightly reduce the door\u2019s size.",
