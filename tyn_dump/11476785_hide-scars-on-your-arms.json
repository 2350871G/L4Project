When it's hot outside, look for cool fabrics like linen that breathe, or UV protecting arm sleeves that cover the arms while cooling your skin. UV protection sleeves can also shield your skin from the sun and help it heal. You can also look for shirts with sheer, long sleeves for hot days or try mesh sleeves to hide scars."

Keep a scarf or light sweater with you that you can throw on in places like the bus, the grocery store, or other public, indoor places that can be a little cooler. A scarf can hide scars on your upper arms and shoulders. If you have scars on your lower arms or wrists, try a light sweater or jacket instead. This can help you avoid questions from others while you're in public."

Keep in mind that tattoos are permanent, so be sure to go to a reputable shop work with your artist to come up with a suitable design together. Make sure your scars are completely healed before tattooing over them. In most places, you need to be over 18 to get a tattoo."
