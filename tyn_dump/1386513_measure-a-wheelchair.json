This will be used to determine the width of the wheelchair\u2019s seat. If the user\u2019s thighs become wider than their hips while sitting down, then measure the width of their thighs instead. Taking this measurement at the widest point of their body while sitting down will ensure that the sides of the seat don\u2019t squeeze the occupant anywhere. To be safe, add 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to this measurement to account for slight movements and comfort when the person is sitting in the wheelchair.Tip: If the person will be using the wheelchair in a cold weather climate, add an extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) to account for the thickness bulky winter apparel like jackets."

Place 1 end of the measuring tape at the rearmost part of their hips and place the other end at the back of their knees.

If they sit with poor posture while they\u2019re being measured, the height of the seat back may not fit them properly when they\u2019re sitting in the wheelchair. This will vary based on how much back support the user requires. If the user will also need a headrest, the height of the chair will need to be extended to the person\u2019s neck.

Even if you don\u2019t think the person using the chair will exceed any weight limits, it\u2019s a good idea to have their weight recorded just in case. Use a chair scale to weigh the person if they can\u2019t stand on an ordinary scale. Portable chair scales can be purchased at any store that sells wheelchairs and other medical supplies. Note that the user will likely need assistance getting into and out of the scale. Most basic wheelchairs can support up to 250 pounds (110 kg).Tip: When buying a wheelchair, consider the doorways, elevators, and ramps that will be encountered on a daily basis. Take quick measurements of these entryways so you can make sure the wheelchair isn't too wide or too tall to pass through them."
