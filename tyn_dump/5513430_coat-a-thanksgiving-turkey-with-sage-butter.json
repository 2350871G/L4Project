    "text": " Preheating the Oven and Making the Sage Butter Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Turn the oven on and adjust the temperature setting. Place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven so there is enough room for the turkey. Chop the sage finely. Rinse 24 fresh sage leaves under cool, running water. Pat the leaves dry with a paper towel and gather them in a pile on a chopping board. Use a sharp knife to finely slice the leaves into small pieces. Mix together unsalted butter, sage leaves, kosher salt, and black pepper. Place 1/2 cup (113 g) of unsalted butter, the chopped sage leaves, 1/4 tsp (1.5 g) of kosher salt, and 1/4 tsp (0.6 g) of freshly ground black pepper into a small bowl. Use a fork to combine the ingredients until they are smooth. Use room temperature butter, as it\u2019s softer and easier to mix. Stuffing and Coating the Turkey Place stuffing into the neck cavity if desired. Either purchase premade stuffing or make your own using breadcrumbs, spices, and meat. Fold open the neck flap and place spoonfuls of stuffing into the body cavity. Spread out the stuffing so it evenly fills the cavity. Adding stuffing is optional. The turkey will still taste great without it! Use your hands to gently separate the turkey\u2019s skin. Find the neck opening and slide your fingers between the skin and the meat. The skin will easily separate away from the meat. Carefully push your fingers around the whole turkey until all of the skin around the legs and breasts is loose.

Place your hands on the outside of the turkey\u2019s skin and rub the skin gently to maneuver the sage butter around. Try to spread out the butter evenly and look under the skin to check if you missed any spots. Trussing and Roasting the Turkey Place the turkey in a roasting pan. Arrange a roasting rack inside a large, flameproof pan. Lift the turkey onto the rack and rest it breast-side up. Tuck the turkey\u2019s wings underneath its back. Hold a wing and raise that side of the turkey by 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm). Tuck the wing under its back and then gently lower the turkey again to hold the wing in place. Repeat this for the other wing. Tucking in the wings stops them from burning and cooks the turkey evenly. Tie the drumsticks together with kitchen twine. Cut an 8 in (20 cm) piece of kitchen twine. Cross the drumsticks at the thinnest part and secure these with the twine. Tie a knot to make sure that the twine doesn\u2019t come undone. Roast the turkey for 3 hours, rotating the pan every 30 minutes. Place the turkey in the oven with the legs pointing towards the back. Turn the pan 90\u00b0 every half hour and baste the turkey with pan drippings if you like crispy skin. As the turkey cooks, check that the legs or breast aren't browning faster than the rest of the meat. Cover the legs or breast with foil if you notice this happening to help the meat cook more evenly.
