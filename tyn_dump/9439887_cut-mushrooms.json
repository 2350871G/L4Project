Go over the outside of the caps using light sweeping strokes to clear away any dirt or sediment that\u2019s clinging to the outside. When the mushrooms are clean, transfer them to a bowl or colander and place them near your prep area. Don\u2019t rinse or soak mushrooms. Their soft, porous structure soaks up water like a sponge, which can cause them to turn out mushy and flavorless once they\u2019re cooked. To clean odd or irregularly-shaped mushrooms, such as morels, place them in a colander and rinse them quickly under a stream of cool water. Then, use a soft-bristled brush to clear away any dirt and debris between the folds and pat the outer surface dry with a paper towel. If the mushrooms look sufficiently clean already, it\u2019s okay to forego the wipedown and skip straight to cutting."

Since mushrooms have such a naturally soft texture, a dull blade can quickly make a mess of them. Avoid knives with serrated edges. The proper cutting method for mushrooms is a blade stroke sawing them will more than likely mangle the meat. Sharpen your knives regularly to make sure they\u2019re up to the task of processing delicate ingredients."
