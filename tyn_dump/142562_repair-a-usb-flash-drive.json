This option is in the lower-left corner of the Start window. Click your flash drive's icon. It will appear in the left-hand column of options in the File Explorer window. Doing so selects it. You may need to click > next to This PC first in order to view the flash drive. Click Manage. This tab is in the upper-left side of the File Explorer window. Click Format. Doing so opens the Format window. Click the \"File System\" box. It's below the \"File System\" heading near the top of the page. A drop-down menu will appear with the following options:\n\nNTFS - The default Windows operating system format. This format only works with Windows. FAT32 - The most widely compatible format. Works on Windows and Mac, but has a storage limit of 32 gigabytes. exFAT (Recommended) - Works on Windows and Mac, and has no storage limit. Click a format option. Choose exFat for the best compatibility, or choose NTFS if you're creating a Windows-only backup drive. If you've formatted your drive before and you're positive that it isn't broken, you can also check the Quick Format box. Click Start, then click OK. Doing this will cause Windows to begin formatting your flash drive for you. Click OK when prompted. Your flash drive has successfully been formatted. Connect the USB flash drive to your computer. Plug it into one of your Mac's USB ports. Some Macs don't have USB ports, so you'll need to purchase an adapter. Click Go. It's a menu item in the top-left side of the menu bar. If you don't see Go, first click the Finder icon, which resembles a blue face in your Mac's dock. Click Utilities. This option is in the Go drop-down menu. Double-click Disk Utility. You'll likely find this option in the middle of the Utilities page. Click your flash drive's name. It's on the far-left side of the Disk Utility window. Click the Erase tab. This option is at the top of the Disk Utility window. Click the \"Format\" box. It's in the middle of the page. This will bring up a drop-down menu with the following options:\n\nMac OS Extended (Journaled) - The default Mac format. Only works on Mac. Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) - Encrypted version of the default Mac format. Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled) - Version of the default Mac format that treats files with the same name differently if there are case differences (e.g., \"file.txt\" and \"File.txt\"). Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted) - A combination of the three above formatting options for the Mac format. MS-DOS (FAT) - Works on both Windows and Mac computers, but has file size limit of 4 gigabytes. ExFAT (Recommended) - Works on both Windows and Mac computers. Has no storage limit. Click a format option. Click MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFat for optimal compatibility. Click Erase, then click Erase when prompted. This will begin the formatting process. Once the formatting is complete, you'll see an icon for your flash drive appear on your Mac's desktop. Repairing Physical Damage Understand that physically repairing a flash drive is unlikely to work. Unless you have professional experience in repairing physically damaged flash drives, do not try to open it. If the flash drive's internal storage is damaged, your only viable option is to take the drive into a professional repair service. The prices for data recovery can vary from $20 - $850 based on the severity of damage done to the drive, and the type of recovery required. Look for grit or foreign objects in the USB drive's mouth. It may not be able to connect to your computer because of an easily-removed blockage. If you see something inside of the USB drive's mouth, gently swab it out with a toothpick or a q-tip. Try testing the flash drive on another USB port or computer. It may be the USB port that isn't working rather than the USB drive itself. Get your repair tools for soldering a broken connector. If you decide you are comfortable risking your files, you will need:\nA soldering iron with solder and flux\nAn old USB cable\nWire cutters/strippers\nA small flathead screwdriver\nA magnifying glass or jeweler's loop Remove the flash drive's casing. Do so with your flathead screwdriver. Use the magnifying glass to inspect the circuit board (PCB) and solder pads. If the PCB (the green circuit board) itself is damaged or the solder pads are lifted, you will probably need the help of a professional. Solder pads are the 4 bits of solder that connect the prongs of the USB connector to the copper lines in the circuit board. If the connector has broken away without causing damage to the PCB or solder pads, continue to the next step. Set the flash drive on a hard surface. Do so with the connector end facing toward you and the solder pads facing up. Use wire cutters to cut one end off of the USB cable. Make sure you cut the USB end if the flash drive cable is an adapter. Strip away a section of the USB cable's wire. Try to expose about 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) of each of the four wires inside the cable that's attached to the USB cable. Solder each of the four wires to the four solder pads. Take your time while doing this, since failing to adequately secure the connection will most likely render your flash drive inoperable. Plug the other end of the USB cable into a computer. It should fit into one of the rectangular slots on your computer's housing. Open your flash drive if possible. If your flash drive is recognizable by the computer, open it and move your files over onto your computer as quickly as possible:\n\nWindows - Open Start, click the File Explorer icon, and click your flash drive's icon. Mac - Open Finder and click your flash drive's icon. If the flash drive doesn't connect to your computer, you can try taking it to a tech department to see if they can still pull the files off of it.",
