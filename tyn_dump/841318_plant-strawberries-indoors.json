Push the toothpick end gently underneath one of the seeds on the skin of the strawberry. Quickly flick your wrist to get the seed out. You need to use a flicking motion because strawberry seeds move fast, and if you try to push it out, you'll just dig a hole in your strawberry. Keep flicking seeds off and putting them on your plate. Collect as many as you think you'll need but a good amount is around 20-30 seeds, to ensure that at least one takes. Planting the Strawberry Seeds Fill a cup, jar or other container with soil suitable for growing strawberries.  Dip the toothpick in water. It should be damp, not dripping wet. Take the tip of the toothpick and poke a couple of your seeds, they should stick onto the toothpick without falling off. Once about five to seven seeds have stuck to the toothpick, hold the toothpick over the soil-filled cup. Flick the top of the toothpick (not the seeds) with your middle or forefinger. The strawberry seeds should fall off and scatter into the cup. Do not push the seeds down. Repeat several times until all of the seeds are in the soil-filled cup (or container).  Helping the Seeds to Grow Fill a  cup of water a third of the way. Add two thirds hydrogen peroxide. Stir the mixture. Dip the toothpick in this solution. Then drip some of the solution over the seeds. This will help them grow, as hydrogen peroxide is a natural oxidizer. Note: You do not need to do this every day\u2013\u2013every other day is fine until the seeds have sprouted, then once a week is all you need. Water the soil gently. Don't overdo the watering or the seeds will drown and can turn moldy. Keep the soil moist but not wet, watering about once or twice a week. Place the jar in a warm place where there is enough sunlight for the seeds to sprout.  Wait until the seeds sprout. In a few days, the seeds should have sprouted. If enough plants take, you can transplant them after a few weeks, into separate pots. Keep tending to the strawberries.
