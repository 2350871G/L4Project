Go into your printer settings and start heating the nozzle to about 200 \u00b0C (392 \u00b0F). This will help loosen any leftover filament that could be clogging the nozzle. Let the nozzle heat completely before moving on.Tip: 3D printers allow you to adjust the heat settings in multiple parts of the machine.
