Hanging a shelf incorrectly can result in an unsightly slant. Having a second set of hands to help can prevent these kind of errors. Fashioning a Picture Frame Shelf Collect project necessities. This simple shelf is made from a picture frame. You can often find suitable, inexpensive frames at thrift and secondhand stores. Prioritize thick frames, as these will better hide the wooden 1x2 ledge you'll adding behind the frame. Including these, you'll also need:\n1x2 boards (equal in length to the outside perimeter of your frame; thinner boards can be used for thinner frames)\n2-inch screws\nDrill\nGlue\nLevel\nPicture frame\nSaw\nWall anchors (x2) Prepare your work area. You're going to need to cut your 1x2 boards to the dimension of your picture frame, so you'll want to choose a work area where you can easily clean up sawdust, like a place with a hard floor. You'll also want a wide, sturdy, flat work surface, and a surrounding area clear of obstacles and tripping hazards. If you don't have a hard floored work area available to you, you can cut down on cleanup by making a backyard work bench. Lay a wide, flat board between two saw horses on a flat stretch of ground and you're good to go. Cut your 1x2 boards. Your 1x2 boards will follow the entire perimeter of the back of your picture frame, creating a ledge on which you can place your pictures. However, your 1x2 frame should be slightly smaller than the outer perimeter of the picture frame, but bigger than its inner perimeter. Cut your boards to the dimensions of your picture frame using your saw. Since you have chosen a thick frame, the outer perimeter around the outside of the frame will be larger than the inner perimeter on its inside. A 1x2 frame smaller than the outer perimeter but larger than the inner will allow part of the frame to extend beyond the 1x2 frame, hiding it, while the inner perimeter will extend beyond the frame on the inside to create a lip. Decorate your 1x2 boards, if desired. The unpainted wood of your 1x2 frame can be made more appealing many ways. For example, you might add a coat of paint the same color as the wall on which you plan to hang your shelf, or you could stain the wood. It'll be easiest to paint your 1x2 boards before they're assembled into a frame or attached to your picture frame. When painting and staining, follow the label directions carefully. Different brands may have special procedures or techniques to improve the outcome. Allow sufficient time for your decorations to dry before putting together your 1x2 boards into a frame. Paint and staining can give off harmful fumes. Work in a well ventilated area when doing either to prevent the injury or death. Assemble your 1x2 frame. Lay out your now cut 1x2 boards so each board corresponds to and forms a similar shape to your picture frame. Use your drill to connect each board to its neighbor with at least two screws. Before you fasten together any boards with screws, take your picture frame and place it atop your 1x2 frame. If the width of the picture frame extends beyond the 1x2 frame inside and out all around, your 1x2 frame has been cut correctly. Attach your picture frame to your 1x2 frame. Depending on the kind of picture frame you've chosen for this project, the glue you use to fasten your picture and 1x2 frames together may vary. Lay your 1x2 frame so it stands on its long, narrow edges and:\nApply your glue to the entire upward face of the long, narrow edges. In most cases, your picture frame will be wood, and a general purpose wood glue will be most effective. Carefully lower the back of your frame onto the adhesive so the inside and outside perimeters of the frame extend beyond your 1x2 frame. The long edges of both frames should be parallel. Follow the instructions on your glue to determine the length of time you'll need to wait until it is dry. Working on your frame before it has dried could cause it to fall apart. Fasten wall hangers to the 1x2 frame. Because of the way the wood is positioned, it may be difficult for you to hang your picture frame shelf without wall hangers. These should be screwed into place on the back of the 1x2 frame, in the upper left and right corners. Install your shelf and show off your pictures. For most medium sized frames, you should only need a single stud to mount your shelf sturdily to the wall. Large to very large frames might best be supported by two studs. Measure and mark where on the wall's stud(s) you plan to hang your shelf, then:\nAlign your wall hangers with the marks you've made to indicate the placement of your shelf on the wall. Check the shelf with a level and adjust it until it is perfectly flat. Use your drill to fasten the first wall hanger to the wall with a screw. Re-check the levelness of the shelf, and then fasten the final wall hanger with a screw. Creating a Hanging Shelf Gather your supplies and equipment. Using a single pine board, you're going to make a simple shelf hanging from leather straps. The board can be as long or short as you like, though for the purposes of providing a guided example, a length of 12\" (30.5 cm) is used. All said, you'll need:\nChisel (approximately \u00bc\" (.64 cm) wide)\nClamps\nHammer & nails\nLeather punch\nLeather strap (x2; each 20\" (50.8 cm) long)\nLevel\nPencil\nPine board (1-1/8\u2033 (2.86 cm) thick, 12\" (30.5 cm) long)\nRuler/tape measure\nSandpaper (optional; recommended)\nSaw (optional) Ready your work area. You'll need a flat, stable surface to work efficiently and safely. Clear any obstacles or tripping hazards, like electrical cords and unused equipment, out of the way. You may want to work somewhere with hard floor, like your garage, where it'll be easy to clean up wood dust and shavings. Draw a notch-line on your pine board. Lay your board flat on its long, wide face. With your pencil and ruler, measure and mark a line a \u00bc\" (.64 cm) in from one of the long edges so the line extends completely from one end of the board to the other. This line is where you will remove some wood to create a notch in which your pictures will be held. Chisel out the notch. Clamp your wood to your work surface so the wood is firmly held in place. Take your chisel and place it on your notch-line. There should be at least \u00bc\" (.64) of wood between the edge of your notch and the edge of the board. Then:\nAngle the chisel low with respect to the board, with the slanted part of the chisel facing up. Slowly and carefully tap your chisel with a hammer to remove shavings and form your notch. Follow your notch-line with your chisel and hammer from end to end, longways, to create a shallow notch. Generally, your notch doesn't have to be very deep to effectively hold your pictures in place. If you plan on putting unframed pictures on this shelf, you'll only need a very thin notch that's not very deep. Pictures with thick frames will require thicker notches. If you are a little more familiar with woodworking and have the tool available, you may find it quicker and easier to use a wood router to cut your notch. In some cases, if the frame of a picture is too large, it may not fit easily or stably on this kind of shelf. Sand the board. After chiseling out the notch in your board, you may have burs, splinters, or rough spots that remain in the wood. This can give your wood an unfinished look. Run a medium (60 - 100) grit sandpaper over your notch until it's smooth. Prepare the leather straps. If necessary, cut your strap material so you have two straps each measuring 20\" (50.8 cm). Use a leather punch to create holes in both ends of both strips. A nail will fasten the ends of each strap to the wall. Depending on your home and space restrictions, you may want a low hanging shelf, or you may want one that doesn't hang much at all. Attach the leather straps and shelf to the wall. It's always safest and most reliable to hang things on studs, but this small shelf will likely hang on most sturdy walls without causing damage even without a stud. To attach your hanging shelf:\nMark and measure two points about 10\" (25.4 cm) apart, where each strap will attach to the wall. Use a level to make sure the line between the marks is flat. Slide a nail through both punched holes of each leather strap so the strap forms a closed loop. Then use your hammer to hang the strap at the first mark on your wall, then do the same with the second strap. Slide your wooden board, notched side facing up, into the loops formed by your leather straps. Slot pictures into the notch and enjoy your handiwork.",
