Work your way around the wreath until you are back where you started. If the branches have smaller twigs, be sure to pull them away too. You don't have to pull the branches all the way out--just enough to give the wreath a fuller appearance. Skip this step if you have a real wreath. The branches are already fluffed out."

Follow the directions on the can to mist a light coating of fake snow onto your wreath. The product is similar to spray paint, except that it will coat the wreath with textured, white flocking instead. Let the product dry completely before moving on. You can use as much or as little flocking as you want. Keep in mind that the more you use, the harder it will be to secure the items to the wreath. How long the flocking takes to dry depends on the brand that you are using. Check the can for complete drying times, but expect to wait 8 to 24 hours."

Use green floral wire if it is a real wreath. If it is an artificial wreath, simply bend one or two twigs around the battery pack to hold it in place. Keep the lights proportionate to the wreath. Use standard-sized Christmas tree bulbs for large wreaths, and tiny \"fairy lights\" for small wreaths. A single strand of lights should be enough for a small wreath. A large wreath may require 2 strands."

For a more natural-looking wreath, try Christmas picks instead. Match the items to the size of your wreath. The smaller the wreath is, the smaller the items should be. How many items you get depends on the size of your wreath and design. In general, the larger the wreath, the more items you'll have to buy.

        "In general, the larger the wreath, the more items you'll have to buy.",

        "If your design includes a garland, it would be a good idea to wrap it around your wreath now.",

        "Tuck some portions of the garland under the branches.",

        "Do not glue, wire, or secure the items to the wreath; play around with the arrangement until you are happy.",
        "Consider decorating just a corner of the wreath.",
        "Use larger items in the center of the design, and smaller items on the edges.",

        "Tuck long branches into the wreath, then bend the stem behind the wreath to secure it.",

        "They are battery-operated lights, made up of copper or silver wire and tiny LED bulbs.",
        "These lights are not the same as battery-operated Christmas lights.",
        "The bulbs are much smaller, typically the size of a pinhead.",

        "It can be off to the side.",
        "Cut the flowers down to 1 inch (2.5 cm), if you are using them.",
        "Do not pull the fake flowers off of their stems, or you won't be able to secure them to the wreath.",

        "Arrange the flowers in groups of three for better composition and balance.",
        "If you are only covering a small part of the wreath, place the larger flowers in the center, and the smaller ones towards the edges.",
        "Secure the flowers to the wreath.",
        "In most cases, you should be able to just stick the stems through the vines that make up the wreath.",
        "If any flowers feel loose, use a small amount of hot glue to hold them in place.",
