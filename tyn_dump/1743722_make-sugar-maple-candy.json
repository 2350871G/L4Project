                    "description": "Measure and pour the maple syrup into a large saucepan. Pure maple syrup works best as it has the strongest and most genuine flavour. Avoid using maple-flavoured syrup as this won't thicken correctly and has a weaker flavour. Heat the maple syrup over medium heat until it reaches 110 \u00b0C (230 \u00b0F). Stir the syrup with a wooden spoon as it heats to avoid it sticking to the pan. Use a candy thermometer to measure the temperature of the maple syrup. Submerge the tip of the thermometer in the mixture to get a correct temperature reading. Avoid the thermometer touching the pan as this can give a false temperature reading. Run hot water over the inside of the measuring cup before you measure the maple syrup. This will cause less maple syrup to stick to the measuring cup. Purchase maple syrup from a supermarket or natural health food store."
