            "description": "Find a sharp knife. Skinning salmon with a dull blade is both difficult and dangerous. Hold 1 end of the salmon filet with your fingers. Insert your knife between the skin and the meat at a 45-degree angle at the end you are holding the salmon. The edge of the blade should be angled toward the skin. Move the salmon back and forth on the knife. This should cut the salmon easily if your knife is sharp. You should not have to move the knife at all-just the filet."

Any smaller and the omelet will be too thick to fold. Make sure the frying pan is a non-stick pan. Even though the egg will be fried using vegetable oil or butter, a non-stick pan is essential to ensure proper flipping and removal."
