Assembling then Cutting the Pattern (Option 1) Find a space big enough to work on. In this method, you will be assembling the pattern first, then cutting it out. It will work just like a store-bought pattern, which comes on a big sheet. This will take up a lot of space. Find a large table to work on, or clear some space on your floor.

Also, pay attention to the seam allowances. Some patterns include them while others don't. Cutting then Assembling the Pattern (Option 2) Clear some space on your floor or table. In this method, you will be cutting out all of the pieces first, then putting them together. Depending on the type of pattern you are working with, you might need a lot of space. For example, a long skirt will require a lot more space than a pair of gloves. Cut the pattern pieces out. Keep like pieces together with like pieces.
