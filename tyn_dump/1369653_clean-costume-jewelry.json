    "text": " Doing a Dry Clean Find a workspace with good lighting. Overhead lights in dark rooms are likely to cast shadows and should be avoided. Look for a desk with a lamp that you can direct or a clear counter in front of a window. Use a dry baby toothbrush or similarly soft brush to gently brush the piece's surface. Doing this will remove any dirt caked onto the surface. Hold a can of compressed air an inch or two away from the surface of your piece of costume jewelry and spray. This loosens any dirt and dust that might be trapped in the crevices. Inspect your jewelry with a magnifying glass. Look for any additional trapped dirt. Use a toothpick to carefully remove any dirt you spotted with the magnifying glass. Avoid using a metal pick, since this may scratch glass beads or soft gemstones if your hand slips. Polish the piece with a dry, soft cloth. Doing so removes most fingerprints and smudges while giving your jewelry back a bit of its original shine. Using a Gentle Cleansing Solution Mix one part soap with three parts lukewarm water in a small bowl or glass. Use a gentle soap, since harsher soaps may contain chemicals that will damage your jewelry. Dip the soft-bristled baby toothbrush into the soap and water solution. Alternatively, you may use a cotton swab. Tap the brush on the side of the glass or bowl to remove excess solution. Use the least amount of solution possible on your jewelry. Gently brush the gems, beads, and metal of your jewelry with the brush or swab. Apply light pressure to avoid loosening any glue or enameling. Rinse your jewelry under lukewarm water. Try to perform this step quickly. Water can damage costume jewelry, so you must not immerse it for long. Gently blot excess moisture off the piece with a soft, dry cloth.  Lay your jewelry out on a paper towel and finish drying it with a hair dryer. Use the dryer's cool setting, since heat can damage some costume jewelry. Polish the piece with a soft, dry cloth.  Using a Last Resort Cleaning Approach Obtain a non-acetone nail polish remover or a gentle jewelry cleanser. Always read the label on the jewelry cleanser.
