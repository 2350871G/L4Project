You'll need to find a space that you can easily access and that has enough space for everyone you're thinking of inviting. Take some time to think of the perfect space for your New Year's Eve party. If the party is at a club, and there will be admission charges, make sure that is on the invitation as well. Even if there is no charge, some people like to dedicate the party proceeds to a friend in need or a charity. You can host the party in your home. This can help cut down on costs. Try asking a friend to co-host the party in their home if they have the space. You might rent a party hall if you need a lot of room for guests."

Generally you'll want to have 1 downer for every 5 uppers, but you may want to adjust this based on the location and availability of security and emergency services.
