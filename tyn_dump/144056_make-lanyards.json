        "Loosen the loops of your last stitch a bit first.",
        "Then take one of your strands and pull it through the loop of the other strand of the same color, going under the same-color strand as well as the different-colored strand beneath it.",
        "Finally, pull your strand up through the center of the lanyard.",
        "Repeat this for all four strands, pulling each strand tight when they're all through, and then trim the strands to your desired length.",
        "Weaving a Four-Strand Braid Lanyard Cut two equal lengths of material.",
        "Both strands should be 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 m) long, and, to easily differentiate between strands, you will probably want to choose different colors.",
        "This method requires only two pieces of material: the \"four\" comes in when you double over the strands by threading them through your lanyard hook.",
        "Thread both strands through your lanyard hook.",
        "Draw the hook up to the center of your strands by doubling the strands over until their ends line up.",
        "Secure your lanyard hook.",
        "Securing your lanyard hook will make braiding easier.",
        "To secure your lanyard hook, you can hook it to a tack on a wall or a table, pinch it between your knees, or simply tape it down.",
        "Securing your lanyard hook allows you to maintain a tight tension while you're braiding, making the process easier.",
        "Knot the strands to the hook.",
        "Pull the strands together, grab them all from the bottom, twist your wrist so they create a loop together, and draw their loose ends through the loop.",
        "Maneuver the knot near your lanyard hook and continue to pull the loose ends through the loop to tighten.",
        "Separate your strands.",
        "Separate the strands by their color, keeping the same-colored ones together, and holding each pair in a different hand.",
        "Cross your same-color strands.",
        "In each hand, take the strand on the right and cross it over the left.",
        "You should then have two, crossed, same-color strands in each hand.",
        "Cross your two, middle, different-colored strands.",
        "With your two pairs of strands in each hand, cross the two, middle, different-colored strands by bringing the left middle strand over the right middle strand.",
        "Repeat this process.",
        "You will now repeat crossing the strands in each hand and crossing your middle strands until you almost run out of material.",
        "Stop before you do run out, however, because you will need to make a final stitch to secure the end.",
        "You may now disregard the color-specific aspects of the process (which were included for clarity) because what matters is the position and sequence of the weaving.",
        "Tie a knot.",
        "Just before you run out of material, as close as possible to your braid, tie a knot at the end by wrapping all four strands around your forefinger and drawing their ends through the loop (that was created around your finger).",
        "Then pull to tighten.",

        "Weaving a Diamond Braid Lanyard Cut two equal lengths of material.",
        "You can cut it as long as you'd like, but keep in mind that the thicker your material, the smaller the length.",
        "Additionally, you should use different colors to make your lanyard look prettier and to help you differentiate between your strands as you weave.",
        "For boondoggle, 3 to 4 yards is a good length for a beginner's lanyard.",
        "Secure your lanyard hook.",
        "To secure your lanyard hook, you can use a push-pin on a desk or a wall, tape it down, or pinch it between your knees.",
        "The more secure, the better, as you will want to be able to tug on your strands of material throughout this process to tighten the stitching.",
        "Thread both strands through your lanyard hook.",
        "Draw your lanyard hook up to the center of your strands by doubling the strands over it until their ends line up.",
        "You will need to arrange your strands so that the two halves in back are positioned to the left of the two halves in front.",
        "Pull the right-most strand.",
        "Your right most strand is one of the halves in front, so pull it around behind the two, center strands and on top of the center-left strand.",
        "Pull the left-most strand.",
        "Pull the left-most strand around behind the two, center strands and on top of the center-right strand.",
        "Tighten your braid.",
        "Pull your strands to tighten the weave you have just made.",
        "Your lanyard hook will need to be secure for you to do this effectively.",
        "Repeat weaving.",
        "Repeat the exact same process with whichever strands are in the positions designated (e.g.",
        "right-most, center, left-most).",
        "You will repeat this process until you are satisfied with the length or you almost run out of material.",
        "Stop before you run out of material, as you will need to tie-off your end to secure your stitching.",
        "Do not twist your strands as you bend them around behind the others, otherwise it will disrupt the diamond pattern.",
        "Finish your lanyard.",
        "When you are finished, tie a granny knot using the two, uppermost strands: that is, the two strands that are higher up the braid, one of which would have been your next strand to weave.",
        "A granny knot basically consists of two half knots: cross the strands, wrap your top strand around your back strand, and then repeat this for the ends of the half knot you've just created."
