However, you will need to have a tool call a Topsy Tail on hand or create one using the end of a fly swatter. Part your hair into two equal sections on either side of your head. Secure each section with a hair tie so some hair covers your ears and the hair ties sit just below your jaw line. Separate one section of hair so there are two equal sections and a thicker middle section. Try to make the two side sections of hair as even as possible as these will be the loops for the bow. Clip off one of the side sections. Take the Topsy Tail tool or your DIY version of the tool and place the stick end into the outermost layer of the hair tie. Twist the tool so the loop part is closest to your face. Take one side section of hair and pull it through the loop part of the tool carefully. The section of hair should form a small loop. This is one half of the bow. Pull the Topsy Tail tool through your hair to remove it and push the hair tie up to secure the section of hair so it stays in a nice, clean loop. Repeat this process for the other side section of hair to create the other side of the bow. This time though, place the Topsy Tail tool so the loop side faces away from your face. To hide the hair tie, place the tool in the center of the hair tie, take a section of hair from the front and loop it through the loop end of the tool. Pull the tool down and remove it. You should have a nice center bow tie. Complete the same procedure on the other side of your hair so you have two pigtails with two bows. Fan out both bows to make them loop full. Use hair spray to keep the bows in place."
