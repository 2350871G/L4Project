                    "description": "Oak is the most popular quarter-sawn timber. The ray flecks that oak reveals when it is quarter-sawn are spectacular. Maple is another wood that displays an attractive appearance when it is quarter-sawn. Choose one of these types of wood appropriate for the quarter-sawn product you\u2019re trying to create. The \u201cray flecks\u201d that are visible in quarter-sawn wood are the tree\u2019s medullary rays, a type of structure that grows in the wood perpendicular to the growth rings. These structures help transport water and nutrients throughout the tree during life. Quarter-sawn oak is particularly effective for cabinet and furniture making. Oak is also valued for its exceptional stability and resistance to warping. Due to its hardness and fine grain, quarter-sawn maple is ideal for making instruments, decorative boxes, and other fine woodworking projects. The finished wood has a beautiful rippled appearance."

To create the best air flow, elevate your boards on cinder blocks and line them up side by side. If you have a lot of boards, stack them in layers separated by thin wooden slats, then weigh the whole stack down with more cinder blocks. Look for a spot where prevailing winds will blow through the side of the stack of lumber. Use a moisture meter to check the moisture content of the wood periodically. The goal is to achieve a moisture level of around 15-20%. Depending on the weather conditions and the original moisture content of the boards, it may take several months for the lumber to dry."

Preparing Fresh-Cut Logs for Quarter-Sawing Put on personal safety equipment. Wear safety goggles and gloves at a minimum. Put on an apron to keep wood dust from getting on your clothes. Heavy work boots are also recommended both to keep sawdust from getting in your shoes, as well as to protect your feet in case a cut branch or log falls on them.

Cutting Boards from Logs Line the log up on the portable saw carriage and cut it in half lengthwise. Position the log horizontally in the carriage so that the blade can cut through its center.

        "Air-dry your cut boards before you use them.",
        "Freshly sawn wood typically has quite a bit of moisture in it, so your boards will need to be dried before you can use them.",
        "Find a storage spot outdoors where you can stack your boards away from trees (which can drop leaf litter and twigs) or soggy soil.",
        "To create the best air flow, elevate your boards on cinder blocks and line them up side by side.",
        "If you have a lot of boards, stack them in layers separated by thin wooden slats, then weigh the whole stack down with more cinder blocks.",
        "Look for a spot where prevailing winds will blow through the side of the stack of lumber.",
        "Use a moisture meter to check the moisture content of the wood periodically.",
        "The goal is to achieve a moisture level of around 15-20%.",
        "Depending on the weather conditions and the original moisture content of the boards, it may take several months for the lumber to dry."
