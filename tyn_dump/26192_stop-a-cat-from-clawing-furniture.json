When purchasing the scratching post, there are some things to consider initially. Look for one that is at least as tall as your cat when he/she stands on his/her hind legs. Ensure that it is sturdy and cannot wobble when pressure is applied to it by your cat. Make sure that the scratching post isn't heavy and tall, or it may fall on your cat. Scratching boards and posts come in different sizes and uses. Some are flat on the floor and some are raised. Some are made of hemp. Try different types. It is better to have too many around, than not enough. Some cats prefer to scratch on a horizontal surface like the carpet. Orientate the scratch post horizontally or vertically to match their preference and they will be more likely to use it. There are cardboard, sisal, and carpet based options for horizontal surfaced scratching. Whatever you choose, avoid anything fluffy. A cat's scratching post must be like tree bark (their natural scratching element), rough and coarse. Posts with sisal fiber rope wound around them are best, and the scratchier it is, the less inviting your heirloom needlework pieces will seem.

Be aware, however, that the cat may only learn not to scratch when you are present, and may continue to scratch in your absence since they link the punishment directly to you. Another way to curb clawing is to toss a can of pebbles or pennies to land near the cat (do not throw it at them) to startle them. Try not to let the cat see that you threw it. This way, it appears triggered by the scratching, and has nothing to do with you. That way the cat is less likely to scratch when you are away, because they don't associate you directly with the punishment. Then, pick them up and place them next to the scratching pole as a means of conditioning. Don't sound angry or go into a nasty tirade against your cat; remember they are simply following instincts and you're the higher-level being with the ability to control your emotional outburst. Never scold your cat when they are near or using the scratching post. They need to associate the scratching post with all things pleasant and happy.

                    "description": "If you have a spray bottle of water, you could try squirting your cat whenever they go near the furniture and start scratching it. Aim to do this before they start scratching but if not, squirt mid-scratch. This won't hurt the cat but it will help them to associate scratching that piece of furniture with a less-than-pleasant spritz of water! Again, this can also cause the cat to link your presence to getting sprayed, so they may do their scratching when you are not there. You can also use a citrus oil mix to deter your cat. Some cats are repelled by the scent of orange oil. Mix equal parts, about a cap-full each, of eucalyptus oil and orange oil in a spray bottle of water. You can test this on your cat by putting a small amount on a damp cloth and present it close to their nose. You will need to shake the contents before each use as the oil and water will separate after a short time. Using this method not only helps to deter your cat from destroying furniture or walls, but gives your house a pleasant and fragrant odor as well."

In this case, there are several options you can try:\nApply double-sided tape to the furniture. Cats dislike the sticky feeling and won't continue to stick their claws wherever it's sticky, as the hairless skin of the cat's paws is extremely sensitive to touch. For larger furniture, adhere masking tape over the arms, or on the back of the furniture where the cat will often enjoy playing (and hiding from water spritzing). For a larger area, such as a rug or carpet, leave contact sheets sticky side up over the surface you want to protect. You can also buy a product called \"Sticky Paws,\" which are medical grade adhesive sticky strips that can go on curtains, drapes, carpets, and anything else that might be a bit too tempting for your cat. Use the \u201cknobby\u201d side of a plastic or vinyl floor runner along the back of the couch to deter scratching. The cat won\u2019t like the feel of the pointy knobs on their feet. For cats who seem to live it up when you're at work or away from home, cover the furniture in plastic covers. Cats are not fond of walking over plastic because of its smell and feel. You could also try placing blown-up balloons hidden underneath a sheet covering the furniture which will burst when clawed, causing the cat a fright that will be associated with that piece of furniture long after the balloon has popped. If buying new furniture, consider getting a tight weaved chenille or microfiber fabric as opposed to a tweed-like fabric. Cats will not be interested in those types of fabrics as they won't be able to get their claws through. Cats will scratch any furniture made with a thin loose-weaved fabric. Also consider using a \u201cScat mat\u201d to deter cats from certain surfaces and areas."

                    "description": "Since part of the reason for scratching is to sharpen and even shorten claw growth, you can help out with a regular, careful trim of your cat's claws. If you don't know how to clip a cat's claws, ask your vet to show you how to do this the first time, as it is easy to hurt the cat badly if you don't what you're doing. A cat that is not used to claw clipping can be a little bothered by it initially but you need to persevere until they are comfortable with it. Again, praise your cat while your are trimming their claws so that they know you are caring. It is useful to \"blunt\" the tips of the claws of an indoor cat that never has access to outdoor trees. You can do this with toenail clippers (never use claw clippers made for dogs) but you must know the correct cutting line to avoid injuring the cat. Ask your veterinarian or a groomer to show you this for the first time.

While it is still legal to declaw a cat in most (but not all) cities in the United States and Canada, there are some ethical considerations. Declawing is considered to be an act of cruelty, and is thus illegal in Europe and other countries. A significant proportion of cats having undergone declawing refuse to use the cat litter, develop aggressive behaviour (mainly biting and hissing), and show signs of intense stress and fear. It also makes them more vulnerable to predators, and does not allow them to stretch properly. Do your research and make sure that you understand all that you need to know in order to make the decision to amputate the ends of your cat\u2019s toes. The declawing procedure involves amputating the digit at the last joint of your cat\u2019s front paws. Talk to your veterinarian if you think declawing is your choice. Some cats do fine but others suffer from chronic pain and, later, arthritis. Note that if you have a cat that goes outdoors, declawing their front paws may affect their ability to climb and defend themselves. Check the adoption or purchase contract for your cat. Some rescue groups and adoption agencies have \u201cdo not declaw\u201d clauses in the contract you signed to allow your cat to live in your home."

Another way to curb clawing is to toss a can of pebbles or pennies to land near the cat (do not throw it at them) to startle them. Try not to let the cat see that you threw it. This way, it appears triggered by the scratching, and has nothing to do with you. That way the cat is less likely to scratch when you are away, because they don't associate you directly with the punishment. Then, pick them up and place them next to the scratching pole as a means of conditioning. Don't sound angry or go into a nasty tirade against your cat; remember they are simply following instincts and you're the higher-level being with the ability to control your emotional outburst. Never scold your cat when they are near or using the scratching post. They need to associate the scratching post with all things pleasant and happy.

Brian Bourquin, DVM\t\t\tVeterinarian and Owner, Boston Veterinary Clinic\t\t\t\tNever punish your cat. Use redirection if your cat is scratching, but never yell at it, shake it, or hit it. Cats aren't by nature as trusting as dogs, so yelling at your cat can really damage your bond with it. Remember that cats don't scratch to be destructive; they just can't trim their claws on their own. Use water to stop your cat's bad behavior. If you have a spray bottle of water, you could try squirting your cat whenever they go near the furniture and start scratching it. Aim to do this before they start scratching but if not, squirt mid-scratch. This won't hurt the cat but it will help them to associate scratching that piece of furniture with a less-than-pleasant spritz of water! Again, this can also cause the cat to link your presence to getting sprayed, so they may do their scratching when you are not there. You can also use a citrus oil mix to deter your cat. Some cats are repelled by the scent of orange oil. Mix equal parts, about a cap-full each, of eucalyptus oil and orange oil in a spray bottle of water. You can test this on your cat by putting a small amount on a damp cloth and present it close to their nose. You will need to shake the contents before each use as the oil and water will separate after a short time. Using this method not only helps to deter your cat from destroying furniture or walls, but gives your house a pleasant and fragrant odor as well. Redirect your cat's attention. Sometimes you will just need to physically stop the cat from scratching. Remove them from where they are scratching and give them something else to do. Try giving them a toy to play with or petting them for awhile, whatever they enjoy more than scratching. Limiting Your Cat's Access to the Items They Want to Scratch Cover problem furniture. Some pieces just seem to get marked for special scratching treatment because they feel just right to your cat. In this case, there are several options you can try:\nApply double-sided tape to the furniture. Cats dislike the sticky feeling and won't continue to stick their claws wherever it's sticky, as the hairless skin of the cat's paws is extremely sensitive to touch. For larger furniture, adhere masking tape over the arms, or on the back of the furniture where the cat will often enjoy playing (and hiding from water spritzing). For a larger area, such as a rug or carpet, leave contact sheets sticky side up over the surface you want to protect. You can also buy a product called \"Sticky Paws,\" which are medical grade adhesive sticky strips that can go on curtains, drapes, carpets, and anything else that might be a bit too tempting for your cat. Use the \u201cknobby\u201d side of a plastic or vinyl floor runner along the back of the couch to deter scratching. The cat won\u2019t like the feel of the pointy knobs on their feet. For cats who seem to live it up when you're at work or away from home, cover the furniture in plastic covers. Cats are not fond of walking over plastic because of its smell and feel. You could also try placing blown-up balloons hidden underneath a sheet covering the furniture which will burst when clawed, causing the cat a fright that will be associated with that piece of furniture long after the balloon has popped. If buying new furniture, consider getting a tight weaved chenille or microfiber fabric as opposed to a tweed-like fabric. Cats will not be interested in those types of fabrics as they won't be able to get their claws through. Cats will scratch any furniture made with a thin loose-weaved fabric. Also consider using a \u201cScat mat\u201d to deter cats from certain surfaces and areas. Consider creating a deterrent to certain areas with the help of a motion detector attached to a spray or ultrasonic noise. It is generally recommended to correct your cat remotely so that they do not associate the negative correction with you or other humans. Otherwise, you will create fear in the cat toward humans and likely train the cat to scratch in secret. These products can be found online at various retailers. Shut doors to rooms with very special furniture, furnishings, and objects. If you have antiques or furniture that is of great value, consider leaving it in a cat-free zone. Ensure that everyone in the family is aware that the cats must not be let into that area or room and always keep doors to these areas closed. Ask the humans in the house to take care rather than expecting the cat to know the difference between important furniture and less important furniture. If the cat does wander in, shoo him out abruptly so that he associates it with being \"out of bounds.\" Limiting Your Cat's Ability to Scratch Keep your cat's claws neatly trimmed. Since part of the reason for scratching is to sharpen and even shorten claw growth, you can help out with a regular, careful trim of your cat's claws. If you don't know how to clip a cat's claws, ask your vet to show you how to do this the first time, as it is easy to hurt the cat badly if you don't what you're doing. A cat that is not used to claw clipping can be a little bothered by it initially but you need to persevere until they are comfortable with it. Again, praise your cat while your are trimming their claws so that they know you are caring. It is useful to \"blunt\" the tips of the claws of an indoor cat that never has access to outdoor trees. You can do this with toenail clippers (never use claw clippers made for dogs) but you must know the correct cutting line to avoid injuring the cat. Ask your veterinarian or a groomer to show you this for the first time.

Brian Bourquin, DVM\t\t\tVeterinarian and Owner, Boston Veterinary Clinic\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Cats scratch to trim their claws, so to help prevent scratching, trim off the curved part of the nail regularly. If you're not sure how to do it, visit your vet and ask them to show you how. Use plastic caps to cover your cat\u2019s nails. \u201cSoft Paws\u201d glued to your cat\u2019s nails will prevent the cat from damaging surfaces because the cap covers the sharp nail. You can glue these on yourself, or have your veterinarian do it for you. These caps will eventually fall off in three to six weeks and need to be reapplied. Allow your cat some outside time where possible. If your cat is already able to go in and out of the house, it is highly likely that they have found themselves a tree or two to scratch on. Encourage this (unless it's harming the tree) and continue to let them have appropriate outside time, as using nature for a scratching post will definitely reduce their desire to use your furniture as one. Consider the downsides and alternatives to declawing your cat before having it done. Declawing can be a quick and easy way to prevent furniture damage, however, it is a surgery, and like all medical procedures, comes with risks. While it is still legal to declaw a cat in most (but not all) cities in the United States and Canada, there are some ethical considerations. Declawing is considered to be an act of cruelty, and is thus illegal in Europe and other countries. A significant proportion of cats having undergone declawing refuse to use the cat litter, develop aggressive behaviour (mainly biting and hissing), and show signs of intense stress and fear. It also makes them more vulnerable to predators, and does not allow them to stretch properly. Do your research and make sure that you understand all that you need to know in order to make the decision to amputate the ends of your cat\u2019s toes. The declawing procedure involves amputating the digit at the last joint of your cat\u2019s front paws. Talk to your veterinarian if you think declawing is your choice. Some cats do fine but others suffer from chronic pain and, later, arthritis. Note that if you have a cat that goes outdoors, declawing their front paws may affect their ability to climb and defend themselves. Check the adoption or purchase contract for your cat. Some rescue groups and adoption agencies have \u201cdo not declaw\u201d clauses in the contract you signed to allow your cat to live in your home.",

        "If your cat is already able to go in and out of the house, it is highly likely that they have found themselves a tree or two to scratch on.",
        "Encourage this (unless it's harming the tree) and continue to let them have appropriate outside time, as using nature for a scratching post will definitely reduce their desire to use your furniture as one.",
        "Consider the downsides and alternatives to declawing your cat before having it done.",
        "Declawing can be a quick and easy way to prevent furniture damage, however, it is a surgery, and like all medical procedures, comes with risks.",
        "While it is still legal to declaw a cat in most (but not all) cities in the United States and Canada, there are some ethical considerations.",
        "Declawing is considered to be an act of cruelty, and is thus illegal in Europe and other countries.",
        "A significant proportion of cats having undergone declawing refuse to use the cat litter, develop aggressive behaviour (mainly biting and hissing), and show signs of intense stress and fear.",
        "It also makes them more vulnerable to predators, and does not allow them to stretch properly.",
        "Do your research and make sure that you understand all that you need to know in order to make the decision to amputate the ends of your cat\u2019s toes.",
        "The declawing procedure involves amputating the digit at the last joint of your cat\u2019s front paws.",
        "Talk to your veterinarian if you think declawing is your choice.",
        "Some cats do fine but others suffer from chronic pain and, later, arthritis.",
        "Note that if you have a cat that goes outdoors, declawing their front paws may affect their ability to climb and defend themselves.",
        "Check the adoption or purchase contract for your cat.",
        "Some rescue groups and adoption agencies have \u201cdo not declaw\u201d clauses in the contract you signed to allow your cat to live in your home."
