You will need to cut out the template and tape it together. Print and cut out the template.  Buy approximately 1/2 yard (45.7 cm) of cotton fabric and 1/2 yard (45.7 cm) of terry cloth toweling. This amount of cloth will make more than 1 bib, so you can make more than 1 at a time, or measure a piece of scrap fabric to the size of your template to ensure you have enough. Any fabric that you use for a bib should be soft and easily washed. Iron your cotton fabric to take out all of the creases.  Set down your self-healing mat on your craft table, if you plan to use a rotary cutter. Lay the fabric on your craft table with the right side down. Smooth out any wrinkles. Place the pattern on top of the cotton fabric piece. Hold it firmly in place with 1 hand. Trace the pattern around the edges of the template with a fabric pen. Mark a 1 inch (2.5 cm) space at the top right of 1 of the flaps. This will be your gap where you turn your bib inside out after you sew it. Remove the template. Cut a piece of terry cloth so that it is slightly bigger than your piece of fabric. Neither piece of fabric has to be in exact dimensions, as long as it is bigger than the printed template. Place the piece of terry cloth underneath your cotton. The terry cloth should have the right side up and the cotton should be right side down. The right side of terry cloth is the fuzziest side. Smooth out both fabrics. Pin the cotton fabric onto the terry cloth. Sew your Baby Bib Place your pinned fabric onto your sewing machine. Start sewing onto the line you've drawn with your fabric pen. Use a small, straight stitch. Start at the outside edge of your 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap and sew around the perimeter of the bib until you reach the other end of the gap. Make sure you leave the gap open. Use fabric scissors to cut approximately 3/8 inch (1 cm) away from the hem on the outside.  Cut off the 4 corners of the bib flaps at right angles. Be careful to cut across the corner fabric but not the thread. This small snip will make the corners turn more easily. Turn the bib right side out through the 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap on the right top flap. If you are having troubles pulling it through with your fingers, use a knitting needle to gather and pull fabric through the gap. Reach the needle into the clipped corners to ensure you turn the flaps completely flat. Pull the bib fabric down so that the terry cloth peaks through the loop between the flaps. Press the bib flat with an iron. Pin the perimeter of the bib so that you can sew the edges in place. Make sure you pin the neck loop so that the terry cloth does peak out slightly, or it will not be sewn properly. Close up the 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap by turning the fabric in at the edges. Pin it in place around the perimeter. Sew a top stitch around the perimeter of the bib. Do a small, 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance, so that your gap will be closed in the process. Remove 1 pair of snaps from a package of metal snaps. Center 1 side of the snap on the back of 1 of your flaps. Place it approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) from the end of the flap. Sew on the snap by hand. Use a complimentary thread color. Use clean stitches around the perimeter of the snap and knot the thread. Repeat the same process to sew the other side of the snap on the other flap. ",
