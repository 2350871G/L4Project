Canned and dry food are both fine as long as the food includes mostly animal protein and not a lot of filler. While dry food tends to be better at keeping cats' teeth clean, it can also dehydrate your cat as they have a low thirst drive. If you're unsure of what to feed your cat, discuss food with your cat's veterinarian. They'll suggest what to feed your cat based on its specific nutritional needs."

As the cat ages, you should feed it food that gives it complete nutrition without giving it so much that it gets overweight. When your cat gets older, you may need to transition it onto senior food, which provides the type of nutrition that geriatric cats need. Never make sudden food changes for your cat.

In most cases, this type of food helps to prevent hairballs by increasing the amount of fiber your cat is getting. Fiber increases the rate of digestion and moves food, and hair, through the digestive tract more effectively. Ask your veterinarian which hairball-preventing food is best for your cat. They may suggest a food that will not only fulfill your cat's nutritional needs, but also prevent hairballs."

Discuss portion size and feeding schedule with your veterinarian. They may have suggestions based on your cat's specific dietary needs so that you can keep your cat at a healthy weight.

The recirculating water stream, may draw your cat's attention and encourage it to drink more. Keep the cat's water away from its litter box and food. Cats generally see water near these areas as contaminated.

Once you bring a cat home, keep it contained in a small space with food, water, a bed, and its litter box. The cat may naturally head towards the litter box to go to the bathroom, as they are naturally clean animals that like to pick specific bathroom areas. Keep the litter box in an area that is easily accessible and close to your cat's daily activity. This will help ensure that the cat actually uses it instead of a handy corner. Ensure that the litter box is in a quiet, private area. If there is too much traffic or noise, your cat may be too stressed or scared to use it."

Typically, this is done by giving it a bed all its own and placing that bed in a quiet and warm corner. This can be difficult to achieve if you live in a hectic or crowded home, but your cat may even pick the spot itself and all you have to do is provide the cushioning. Many cats love warm, sunny spots with views of the outdoors. Even on cold days, the feeble sunlight will be enough to suit your cat's needs. Some cats like to rotate their sleeping places. One month they may like to sleep next to the window, while another month they may prefer to nap under the bed! Don't force your cat to sleep in a specific spot.

Another benefit is that you won't have to deal with your female cat going into heat, or your male cat spraying indoors and roaming outside to look for a mate. The only cats that shouldn't be fixed are those that are purebred and are intentionally being used for breeding by experienced and ethical breeders. Sterilization is a more expensive alternative allows your cat to keep its hormones. In this case, you should have both a sterilized male and female cat so that they can satisfy each other's needs. Sterilized cats will still go through heats and will maintain normal cat behavior, such as roaming (if there is no mate in the house) or spraying (not all full male cats spray)."

Once your cat gets old, it will likely need veterinary checkups more often, usually every six months. Veterinary checkups may seem like a waste of money if your cat is generally healthy, but they can actually save you money in the long run.

Most vets will not spay or neuter your kitty until they weigh about two pounds, so discuss the right time with your vet. Another benefit is that you won't have to deal with your female cat going into heat, or your male cat spraying indoors and roaming outside to look for a mate. The only cats that shouldn't be fixed are those that are purebred and are intentionally being used for breeding by experienced and ethical breeders. Sterilization is a more expensive alternative allows your cat to keep its hormones. In this case, you should have both a sterilized male and female cat so that they can satisfy each other's needs. Sterilized cats will still go through heats and will maintain normal cat behavior, such as roaming (if there is no mate in the house) or spraying (not all full male cats spray). Take your cat in for preventative veterinary exams. In order to raise a cat properly, you need to provide it with regular veterinary care. When a cat is young, it typically only needs to have an annual exam, in which the veterinarian checks its overall health and updates any vaccines or medications that it needs. Once your cat gets old, it will likely need veterinary checkups more often, usually every six months. Veterinary checkups may seem like a waste of money if your cat is generally healthy, but they can actually save you money in the long run. Finding a health problem early on and getting early treatment can reduce costs, along with your cat's pain and suffering. Keep up to date with preventative medication. When bringing your cat in for a checkup, discuss flea medications and vaccinations with your veterinarian. For flea medications, they will most likely recommend a regular flea repellent treatment, such as Frontline and Trifexis, that you will apply at home. It is important to keep up to date with this medication so that your cat does not experience a flea infestation. Get the vaccinations and vaccination boosters that your veterinarian suggests. They will make suggestions based on your cat's risk of exposure and the health history. The veterinarian may suggest vaccinations for panleukopenia, herpesvirus, calicivirus, rabies, feline leukemia, chlamydiosis, infectious peritonitis, immunodeficiency, bordetella, and giardiasis. Giving Affection and Attention Show your cat love and affection. When you are raising a cat it is important to show them love and affection every day. You can do this by holding it in your lap and petting it for a little while every day. You can do this by playing with it and giving it uninterrupted attention for at least a little while every day. Whatever you do, make sure that your cat knows it is loved and that it is an important member of your family. Many cats only want attention occasionally, and will ask for it when they want it. If your cat is like this, give it some petting and attention when it asks for it. Your cat's requests may not always come when you want them to, but just try to remember that your cat deserves a bit of uninterrupted attention every day. Socialize your cat. In order to raise a happy and well adjusted cat, you should begin socializing it when it is very young. Introduce your cat to a wide variety of people beginning when it is a small kitten, so that it knows that this is a normal part of life. Exposing it to a wide variety of people, and keeping those interactions positive, will make it more likely that the cat is friendly and interested in new people and animals when it is an adult, instead of being scared or aggressive towards new people. Socialization can include exposing your cat to a wide variety of noises and situations. For instance, if you expose a kitten to a vacuum cleaner early on in its life, it's less likely to be fearful of it as an adult. Provide your cat with mind-stimulating toys. All cats need some mental stimulation every day. This is especially true when cats are kittens and their minds are developing. This can be provided, in part, by giving it stimulating toys to play with while it is alone. These toys could include motorized cat toys that it can chase around, but it can also include simpler toys, such as toy mice or balls with bells in them. You may need to bring home a variety of toys before you find the right one. Try out the toys with your cat one at a time until you find the one it prefers. Cats can get bored with toys that they have played with for a long time. Provide new and exciting toys on a regular basis. Your cat's preferences may change with age. A cat that liked a squeaky mouse toy as a kitten may prefer dangly string as an adult. Interact with your cat daily. In addition to giving your cat toys for it to play with on its own, you should spend quality time playing with your cat every day. When raising a cat, it is important to spend quality interactive time with it in order to develop its mind and personality. Use a feather on a string or a laser pointer to get the cat to run around and leap into the air. Throw little toys for the cat to chase and play other games that the cat enjoys. This interaction will likely be more stimulating to the cat than playing on its own. If your cat is really intelligent, you can even try to train it to do things, such as tricks you would normally teach a dog.",
