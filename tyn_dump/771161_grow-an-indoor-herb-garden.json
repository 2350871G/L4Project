        "Carefully slide the herb into the hole.",
        "Pat the soil around the herb.",
        "When you are done, water the herb until the soil is damp, but not soaking wet.",
        "Keep the herb in a shady spot for the first few days before moving it to a sunnier location.",
        "Don't worry if the leaves turn droopy at first.",

        "Growing Herbs from Cuttings Choose the right herbs.",
        "Not all herbs grow well from cuttings.",
        "The following herbs tend to grow better from cuttings than others: lemon balm, mint, oregano, rosemary, and thyme.",
        "Cut a three-to-four inch (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) long segment from your chosen her.",
        "Measure down three to four inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) starting from the tip.",
        "Cut the herb using a pair of sharp scissors.",
        "Take your cutting in the springtime when the plants are starting to grow because actively growing plant stems will root the best.",
        "Make sure that the herb you are cutting from is healthy.",
        "The leaves should not be withered looking or yellow.",
        "Pull off any leaves from the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) or so.",
        "You will be placing the cutting in water.",
        "Any roots on the bottom can rot.",
        "They can also prevent any roots from forming.",
        "Place the herb into a glass of water, and leave it in a sunny spot.",
        "Make sure that the water is no higher than the leaves.",
        "Also, take care to avoid direct sunlight, as this can damage the cutting.",
        "If you want to plant the cutting immediately, use root hormone, which will help the stem form roots after it's planted in soil.",
        "Dip the cut end into root hormone, then plant it into the ground.",
        "You can also use ground cinnamon in place of the hormone.",
        "This will kill any bacteria that can lead to rot or mold.",
        "It will also give the roots a \"boost.\"",
        "Change the water daily until the roots form.",
        "Depending on the type of herb you cut, you might see roots forming in as little as 2 days.",
        "It can also take as long as 2 weeks.",
        "Changing the water is very important.",
        "If the water is not fresh, bacteria may develop and keep the herb from growing roots.",
        "Plant the cutting in soil when the roots are \u00bc to \u00bd inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) long.",
        "Fill a 6 inch (15.24 centimeters)  wide pot with good-quality potting soil.",
        "Poke a hole into the soil, and slide the cutting in, until the roots are covered.",
        "Pat the soil around the cutting, and water it.",
        "Water the soil until it is damp, and place the pot in a sunny location.",

        "Caring for Your Garden Water only when the top layer of the soil is dry.",
        "Keep watering until water leaks out through the drain hole at the bottom of the pot.",
        "You shouldn't have to water your herbs more than once or twice a week.",
        "If you water too often, the soil will become waterlogged.",
        "This can lead to root rot, which can kill your herbs.",
        "Make sure that your herbs get enough sunlight.",
        "Every herb is different, so you might want to read the seed packet, or the label that came with your herb.",
        "In general, however, most types of herbs need 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day.",
        "A bright, sunny window would be ideal.",
        "If you live in a place that gets very little sunlight, consider getting a UV lamp for your herbs.",
        "Consider rotating the pots every 4 to 5 days.",
        "This will help the herbs grow straight up, instead of bent to the side.",
        "Don't forget to feed your herbs.",
        "Water, sunlight, and potting soil are not enough to grow healthy herbs.",
        "You will need to fertilize them every once in a while.",
        "When buying a fertilizer, make sure that you get something that promotes healthy leaves instead of pretty flowers.",
        "After all, you eat the leaves of herbs, and not their flowers.",
        "Remember to prune and harvest your herbs.",
        "This will help them produce more leaves.",
        "When harvesting, make sure that you leave a few inches of stem on the plant.",
        "This will allow the plant to continue to grow.",
        "You also want to avoid taking the large leaves.",
        "These leaves capture the most sunlight, and aid the plant with photosynthesis.",
        "Many herbs will produce flowers.",
        "You will want to pinch these off, so that the herb can focus on producing tasty leaves rather than pretty blooms.",
        "The one exception to this is chamomile; the flower itself is the herb.",
        "Pick leafy herbs, such as basil, right at the top of the stem.",
        "Snip delicate herbs, such as cilantro and parsley, closer to the base of the stem.",
        "Trim woody herbs, such as rosemary, with scissors or garden shears."
