You can find ones specifically for the ceiling online or in most home improvement stores. When looking for a rod, choose one that's 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) wider than your window. Also, pick up some hollow wall anchors (molly bolts) if your brackets don't come with them and you have plaster ceilings; they should be the same size as the screws that come with your kit. Screws work fine if you're going into wood, but with plaster, you need to anchor the holes with something sturdier. If you're not sure what to get, ask for help at the home improvement store.

Then, you should place the brackets either right at the outer edges of the window or 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) past the ends of the window on either side. Mark where the brackets should go with a pencil. Keep in mind, you're aiming for the curtain rod to extend 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) on either side. However, the end decoration may affect how far you want the brackets out from the window. If the decorations are wide, you may want to place the brackets closer to the width of the window so that there's room for the caps to extend past the brackets. Always hold the rod up to your marks to see if it looks right. If you're going to be doing several windows of the same size, try making a template out of cardboard. Mark where the edges of the windows are and where you should drill the holes on the cardboard. Then you can use it to easily figure out where to drill above each window."

        "The teeth on the anchor should catch.",
        "Then, use a Phillips head screwdriver or screwdriver bit for your drill to turn the screw to the right.",
        "The anchor should be held in place by the teeth.",
        "As the drill turns, the metal pieces behind the anchor will tighten up.",
        "When it feels tight, you can stop and pull the screw out.",
        "Turn the screw to the left to pull it out.",
        "You can use the screwdriver or a drill bit, but make sure to reverse the drill to pull it out.",
        "Most drills have a \"reverse\" button.",
        "Repeat the process for all the holes.",
        "Screw the track into place.",
        "Hold the track up against the anchors.",
        "Begin at one end, and put the screw through the track's braces to the anchor below.",
        "Use your fingers to screw it in a little until it catches, then place the tip of the drill against the tip.",
        "Turn the drill on slowly to screw it into place.",
        "Repeat the process with each screw until you've done them all and the track is held in place.",
        "Insert the curtain hooks into the loops on the track.",
        "You should have loops all along the bottom of the track.",
        "Start at one end, and grab a hook on one end of the curtain.",
        "Put one hook in each loop you see.",
        "Make sure not to skip any, as that will leave gaps in your curtains.",
        "When you've reached the last loop and hook, you're done.",
        "If your curtain doesn't have the hooks, you can insert them in place at the top of the curtain on the back.",
        "The holes should be marked, and you just slip it underneath the bottom edge of the hem and out through the top.",
        "You can also install pull wands in the middle of the track simply by hooking them into place over the loops."
