Almost every biathlete has been injured through overtraining at some point or another, and these injuries aren't like your usual 'sit out for a week because you pulled a muscle' injuries like in other sports. When biathletes push too hard, they are often plagued by chronic pain for months or even years. Some are injured for life. While its good to push your body past its limits in races and intensity, pushing yourself beyond your capacity the six days you train a week never ends well. So know where to draw the line, because crying yourself to sleep because of every night and watching all your friends have fun at races is never fun. Always stretch!
