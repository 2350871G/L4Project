Suitable themes that still focus on the tasting aspect include: floral garden, Japanese, Russian, tropical, winter wonder, Southern style and Moroccan. Each of these themes could easily incorporate a range of tea varieties for tasting. Fantasy themes are also a great choice. For example, if you are a huge Alice in Wonderland fan, try a \u201cMad Hatter\u201d tea party for a bit of an edge. The time of day may influence your theme. For example, mid- to late-morning could be brunch, mid- to late-afternoon could be an early light dinner, etc."

            "description": "During the colder months, it will have to be indoors or in the morning room/conservatory. For warmer weather, the garden provides more opportunities, from the patio to the rose garden or herb patch. If you'd rather hold the party out of your house, try renting a room in a suitable clubhouse, hotel or restaurant, keeping an eye on your budget of course. Your choice of where to hold the tea party will also be determined by your ability to boil the water for tea (and keep it warm). If you hire a place, check that they'll do this for you, or provide a space for you to do it. Think about whether you'll need helpers; if you're hosting and serving, it can be a bit hectic. Friends or family may be willing to do some of the organizing and tea serving with you."

For Chinese or Japanese tea tasting, you'll need to use the appropriate non-handled small teacups made in China or Japan (visit local Asian grocery stores for stock).

Six different teas may be the norm for a tea tasting party, however you can go with four or even eight depending on the crowd and the amount of time. Like a wine tasting party the idea is to soak in and appreciate the tea so, while you want to provide guests with enough tea to savor, you want them to have enough gastronomical room to accompany each flavor. Decide how you'll present the tea. Teas will need to be in a serving container, usually a teapot (or a thermal drink container). Display ideas might include lidded mugs (see image for concept) or bowls of tea with tea leaves on small square plates. Clearly label and provide background information about each tea. In some cases, providing a bowl of the original tea leaves can be helpful for tasters to see the original tea and smell it in its dry state. Using your background research on the tea you're serving, let your guests know about the tea\u2019s origin. It can also be fun to share information about the tea's health properties, historical tidbits of interest and any other fun facts. Provide each guest with a quarter cup sample of each tea."

Offer nearly every kind of sweetener including artificial for diet-conscious guests. Instead of sugar or sweetener in small packets consider a bowl of sugar cubes, honey in a tiny honey pot or a bowl of sugar with a dainty spoon. Have trays of small, delicate sandwiches and cookies displayed on tables. Sugar wafer cookies and scones are considered to be traditional sweets for a tea tasting party. Also, cucumber or watercress sandwiches may be a lovely addition to your party. Keep the snacks light in order to maintain focus on the main attraction\u2013\u2013the tea. Don't forget to place pitchers of ice water and glasses on each table. Even though tea is not as heavy as wine, provide enough ice water for your guests in the event they want to clean their palate.

While you may not be having tea with the Royals, knowing proper English-influenced (or Southern-style) tea etiquette can be a fun way to host your tea tasting party.

When tea drinkers use their pinkie it\u2019s raised slightly in the air for balance. Show your guests how to use the teaspoon. Instead of rapidly stirring your tea in a circular motion, tea drinkers should carefully move their spoon gently through the tea in a wave motion before placing the spoon on the saucer. Demonstrate how to serve tea. Traditionally, tea is typically served with milk, not cream. However, in the event of a tea tasting party you should instead just serve it plain so guests can appreciate the tea\u2019s true essence. Note that the method of serving tea changes depending on the cultural angle you're taking; for example, Japanese and Chinese tea serving ceremonies tend to be more elaborate than those of the English tea serving. Read up on the style you're planning to introduce. Explain the proper way to drink tea. Proper ladies and gentlemen never slurp or chug their tea.
