If you are able to, clean the tires in a shady spot so they stay cool and don\u2019t dry out as quickly. A pressure washer is more effective than a garden hose.

The best option to get is an all-natural whitewall tire wash, especially if your tires still have any paint left on them. Otherwise, you can safely use another wheel cleaner without any risk to your tires. Make sure the tire is well-covered, particularly the outer edge where the paint will go. Work on the tires one at a time. That way, you can focus your energy on one of them without worrying about the others drying off. Whitewall tire cleaners are formulated without bleach or alcohol, so they don\u2019t crack or yellow paint. Other types of wheel cleaners may have harsh chemicals in them.

Focus on one tire at a time. It\u2019s better to remove, paint, and replace them individually instead of all at once. You will have to move the jack and jack stands to remove each tire.

Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the recommended drying time. Keep in mind that the primer will take longer to dry in cool or humid conditions.

        "You will have to move the jack and jack stands to remove each tire.",
        "If you\u2019re removing them all at the same time, use plenty of jack stands, blocks, or hydraulic lifts to keep the car off the ground.",
        "Unscrew the lug nuts by hand or with a wrench.",
        "Since you loosened the lug nuts earlier, they should be easy to remove now.",
        "Just rotate them counterclockwise until they come off.",
        "Switch to using a wrench if they are still a little resistant.",
        "Then, set them all aside in a safe spot for later.",
        "Be careful to avoid moving the car at all.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s secure on the jacks before attempting to remove the wheels.",
        "Remove the tire and lay it flat on a covered surface.",
        "Place a drop cloth or a piece of scrap material, such as a sheet of cardboard, on the ground.",
        "To pull the tire off, stand in front of it and pull it toward you with both hands.",
        "Afterward, place it rim-side up on the floor.",
        "Don\u2019t paint on an uncovered surface.",
        "Painting can get a little messy, so your floor could end stained before you\u2019re through.",
        "Drop cloths are available online or at most hardware stores.",
        "However, scrap material works just as well, but make sure it\u2019s bigger than the tire.",
        "Cover the tire with \u20442 in (1.3 cm)-wide masking tape.",
        "Check the tread around the outer edge of the tire.",
        "Tires have a slightly raised ridge on the edge of the tread.",
        "Place tape around this ridge, then cover the metal rim with tape as well.",
        "You could also cut a piece of cardboard and tape it over the rim.",
        "It will help keep the rim clean.",
        "Make sure the tire is well-sealed so paint doesn\u2019t leak under the tape.",
        "It can prevent you from getting that clean, circular pattern whitewall tires have.",
        "Applying Whitewall Paint Select a white spray primer if you want extra protection for the paint.",
        "Choose one that is water-resistant and good on exterior surfaces.",
        "General, all-purpose spray-on primers are fine.",
        "Try using a flat-colored primer so that it doesn\u2019t show through the paint when you add it later.",
        "While you can paint without using a primer, whitewall tires have a chemical in them that causes paint to turn brown.",
        "Using a primer can help block out that chemical.",
        "Make sure the primer is compatible with the type of paint you\u2019re going to use.",
        "If you\u2019re using a general primer, this won\u2019t be a problem.",
        "Apply a coating of primer to the tire.",
        "Hold the spray can about 6 in (15 cm) from the surface of the tire.",
        "After shaking the can briefly, press the button on the nozzle to begin spraying the primer.",
        "Work from top to bottom, moving along the uncovered portion at a moderate, consistent pace.",
        "Cover the rubber in a single, consistent layer of paint.",
        "Finding the right pace can be a little tricky if you have never used spray paint before.",
        "Watch how the paint sticks.",
        "If it looks spotty, sweep the canister along at a slower rate, and speed up if the paint builds up too much.",
        "Wait 1 hour for the primer to dry before recoating it.",
        "Spray primer dries quickly, so you won\u2019t have to wait too long to continue working.",
        "Make sure the primer feels dry to the touch before doing anything else to the tire.",
        "Then, check the base layer of primer.",
        "If it looks thin or uneven, refinish it with a second layer.",
        "Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the recommended drying time.",
        "Keep in mind that the primer will take longer to dry in cool or humid conditions.",
        "Since whitewall tires often discolor paint, it\u2019s a good idea to add 2 or even 3 layers of primer to help block out the chemicals.",
        "Spread a whitewall paint over the tire with a brush.",
        "Purchase a whitewall tire paint and a regular, soft-bristled paintbrush.",
        "After stirring the paint, dip the brush in to coat the bristles, then apply the paint over the area you primed earlier.",
        "Keep the coating as consistent as possible.",
        "Whitewall paint is available online.",
        "It can be somewhat expensive and difficult to find.",
        "Plus, it doesn\u2019t always stay white for very long.",
        "Another option is to use white spray paint.",
        "Try using one designed for difficult surfaces or plastic.",
        "Acrylic house paints can also work pretty well, but you can also use Plasti Dip.",
        "Let the paint dry for 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations first, since the drying time will vary depending on what kind of paint you use.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s dry to the touch.",
        "Keep in mind that the paint will take longer to dry during cool or humid weather.",
        "While you\u2019re waiting, you can clean off your paintbrush to prevent it from accumulating dried paint.",
        "Dip it into a small, plastic container filled with turpentine, then let it dry on its own before using it again.",
        "Apply a second coating of whitewall paint onto the tire.",
        "Work slowly to avoid getting the paint on the rest of the tire.",
        "When you\u2019re done, let the paint dry, then check its consistency.",
        "If it still looks uneven, add an additional layer.",
        "After the paint has finished drying, peel the tape off the tire and clean your paintbrush.",
        "You could also finish the tire with a clear coat.",
        "It\u2019s a transparent type of paint that blocks sunlight, preventing underlying paint from yellowing."
