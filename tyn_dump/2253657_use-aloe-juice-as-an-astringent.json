When blended, it will create a thick aloe juice perfect for astringent purposes. Use as much aloe as you like. However, 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) is more than enough to cover your face and neck. Once blended, pour it into a sealed container and store it inside your refrigerator for up to a week.Tip: While using freshly harvested aloe is best, you can buy pure aloe in a bottle from many pharmacies and natural grocery stores.
