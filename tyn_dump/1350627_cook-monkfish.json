Grab a large, deep pot with a rim taller than 7\u20138 inches (18\u201320 cm). Fill it with 3 US quarts (2.8 L) of peanut or vegetable oil. Heat the pot over medium-high heat for 15-20 minutes to heat the oil. The oil needs to reach at least 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C). Use a thermometer to check the temperature before adding your fish.

Mix the ingredients together with a slotted spoon or by hand until the ingredients look thoroughly mixed.Tip: You can buy a pre-mixed seafood seasoning, or make your own by mixing salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and paprika. Feel free to experiment with the seasonings that you use! Create a well in the flour mixture and pour your beer in.

There may be some oil that shoots out of the pot once you add the monkfish, so keep your hands away from the pot. Fry the monkfish for 7-10 minutes and blot the excess oil off. Let the monkfish cook for 7 minutes. Then, use your tongs to carefully lift the filets out. If the exterior of the fish is entirely browned, your fish is done cooking. If it\u2019s still a little pale, or clear juices come out of the fish, let the filets cook for another 3-4 minutes. Once they\u2019re browned, remove the filets and put them on a plate with paper towels. Wait 2-3 minutes to let them cool and blot them dry with another paper towel. If you aren\u2019t sure if the fish is done or not, take a piece out and cut it in half. If the interior is opaque, white, and there are no clear juices, the fish is done cooking. Serve your monkfish with remoulade and French fries. For the classic fish and chips, serve your monkfish with French fries and remoulade sauce. You can also choose to serve the fish on its own if you prefer. Plate your fish and sides to make 4 servings. Wrap leftovers in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and store in the fridge. The fish should be good for 2-3 days after. Saut\u00e9ing Monkfish and Mushrooms Dice your mushroom caps into 0.25 in (0.64 cm) chunks. Take 0.5 pounds (0.23 kg) of shiitake mushrooms and pull the stems out. Set your caps out on a cooking board and dice them into 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) pieces with a flat-edged knife. Do not use a serrated blade to dice your mushrooms. Melt 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter in a skillet and add the mushrooms. Place a clean skillet on one of your stove\u2019s burners. Turn the heat on the burner up to medium. Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter to the skillet and spread it around to let it melt. Add your mushrooms to the skillet. A cast iron skillet is best, but you can really use any non-stick skillet for this. Season your mushrooms to taste and saut\u00e9 them over medium heat. Sprinkle salt and pepper over your mushrooms based on your personal preference. Roughly 1 teaspoon (5 g) of each seasoning is a good option if you\u2019re unsure about how much you want to add. Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms by mixing them with a spatula or wooden spoon. Let them heat for 5-10 minutes until the mushrooms are soft and darkened. You can eat shiitake mushrooms raw, so you don\u2019t need to cook them for a predetermined period of time. Once the mushrooms have softened and look delicious, feel free to move on to the next step. Add your wine to the mushrooms and heat them until the wine dissipates. Pour 0.25 cups (59 mL) of white wine carefully into the skillet. Move the skillet around to spread the wine around. Continue heating the mushrooms over medium heat until the wine is entirely evaporated and you see no liquid left in the skillet. This can take anywhere between 1-5 minutes. Chardonnay or Chablis are both excellent choices, but you can use any type of wine that you\u2019d like so long as it\u2019s white. Transfer your mushrooms to a bowl. Turn your burner off. Take your mushrooms and transfer them to a large bowl. Set the mushrooms aside for now.Tip: You can use the same skillet to cook your leeks and chicken stock if you\u2019d like to. This will mix some of the residue from your mushrooms into the broth and make the flavor more uniform. You don\u2019t need to worry about your mushrooms cooling off. You\u2019ll reheat them once your broth is boiling. Cut and trim your leeks into 0.5 in (1.3 cm) thick lengths. Wash 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of leeks under cool water and set them out on a cutting board. Trim off any white portions of the leeks and discard them. Split each leek in half with your knife and trim them down into 2\u20136 in (5.1\u201315.2 cm) lengths. You can really use any kind of knife to do this so long as it doesn\u2019t have a serrated blade. Melt 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter in a skillet and add your leeks. Use medium heat to melt your butter in a skillet. You can use a new skillet, or you can re-use the skillet you used to cook the mushrooms. Once the butter is melted, add your leeks and spread them around in the butter with a slotted spoon. Try to avoid burning the butter in the pan before adding your leeks. If it starts to smoke a little after you\u2019ve added the leeks, don\u2019t worry about it. Add your chicken stock to the leeks and bring it to a boil. Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of chicken stock or broth carefully into your skillet. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring the stock to a rolling boil. This may take anywhere from 5-15 minutes based on the heat and skillet that you\u2019re using.Tip: While you\u2019re bringing the stock to a boil, get started on your monkfish. Dredge and heat the fish while the stock is heating to save time. Season your monkish to taste and dredge them in flour. Fill a mixing bowl with all-purpose flour. Add 1-3 teaspoons (roughly 5-15 g) of salt and paper to the top of the flour. Take 1.25 pounds (0.57 kg) of monkfish filets or medallions and dredge them in the flour and seasonings. Flip each piece up and down repeatedly in the flour until the entire exterior of each piece is covered. You can use more salt and pepper if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s totally up to you how many spices you want to use. You can add red pepper flakes, paprika, chili powder, or parsley to the flour as well if you\u2019d like. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet and add your monkfish. Take 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil and add it to a separate skillet. Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes until it starts smoking. Take your monkfish filets and drop them carefully into the skillet. Heat them until they\u2019re brown on the side that is in contact with the skillet, which will take 3-4 minutes. It may take anywhere from 5-10 minutes for the vegetable oil to start smoking in the pan. Cook the fillets over high heat until they\u2019re browned. Use a spatula to get under each monkfish filet. Flip them carefully in the pan. Cook the fish on their other side for 3-4 minutes until the fish is browned on both sides. Turn the heat off once the fish is completely cooked and leave it there as you combine the mushrooms and the broth. Add your mushrooms to the stock and serve with your monkfish on top. Take your mushrooms and pour them into the stock as it\u2019s boiling. Stir the ingredients for 2-3 minutes and pour the combination into a clean baking dish. Add your monkfish to the top of the baking dish and serve. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to plate the fish, broth, and mushrooms. Monkfish pairs incredibly well with potatoes. If you\u2019re looking for a side dish, consider mashed, baked, or oven-roasted potatoes. Store your monkfish in an airtight container and reheat on the stove or in the microwave. The dish should stay fresh for 2-3 days.",
