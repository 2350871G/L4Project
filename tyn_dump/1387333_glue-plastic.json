        "Apply glue to both surfaces.",
        "Use a small brush to apply an even layer of adhesive to both surfaces where they will be attached.",
        "For tiny pieces, such as a broken piece on a plastic model, you can use the tip of a needle instead.",
        "If you are using a solvent cement (not a poly cement or plastic cement), you should clamp the pieces together first, then use an applicator bottle to put a thin line of solvent cement along the edge between the pieces, where it will be drawn between them.",
        "If you are using it on plastic pipes, see Gluing Plastic Pipes instead.",
        "Press the pieces lightly together.",
        "Press them together to get them in place and remove air bubbles.",
        "Don't push so hard that the adhesive oozes out of the joint.",
        "If it does, wipe away the excess unless you are using an acrylic cement, which should be left to evaporate.",
        "Keep the pieces firmly in place.",
        "Use a clamp, vise, masking tape, or rubber bands to hold them firmly together.",
        "Read the instructions on your adhesive container to know how long to leave them in place.",
        "Depending on the type and brand of adhesive, the bond could take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to develop.",
        "Many plastic adhesives continue to \"cure\", or develop a stronger bond, for days or even weeks after application.",
        "Avoid applying stress and heat to the glued piece for at least 24 hours after application, even if the bond seems strong.",
        "Gluing Plastic Pipe Identify your pipe.",
        "There are three types of plastic pipe, and each will only work with certain glues.",
        "The easiest way to identify them is to look for the worldwide recycling symbol, a triangle formed from three arrows with a number or letters to identify the type of plastic.",
        "Learn how to use this and other identification methods before selecting a glue.",
        "PVC pipe is common in residential plumbing, although it should not be used for distribution lines or other high-temperature applications.",
        "It is usually white, or grey if used for electrical or industrial purposes.",
        "Its recycling symbol is 6 or PVC.",
        "CPVC pipe is PVC pipe treated to withstand higher temperatures.",
        "It has an identical recycling symbol (6 or PVC) but is usually tan or cream colored.",
        "ABS is an older and more flexible type of plastic piping, usually black in color.",
        "It is not suitable for drinking water purposes and in some regions may not be legal for any plumbing uses.",
        "Its recycling symbol is 9, ABS, or 7 (other).",
        "PEX pipe is the newest type of plastic piping, available in many colors.",
        "It is not recyclable.",
        "It cannot be glued, and must be attached using mechanical fitting tools.",
        "Select an adhesive.",
        "The material that bonds plastic piping together is called solvent cement.",
        "Find the specific solvent cement you need after you've identified the type of plastic.",
        "ABS solvent cement will join two ABS pipes together.",
        "PVC solvent cement and CPVC solvent cement similarly join two pipes of that type.",
        "Transition solvent cement is used to join an ABS pipe to a PVC pipe.",
        "Its distinctive green color makes it easy to identify.",
        "If you can't find a more specialized product, universal solvent cement will do an okay job for any combination of PVC, CPVC, and ABS.",
        "You should still identify your pipe beforehand to rule out PEX pipe, which must be fitted instead of glued.",
        "Read the label of the solvent cement to make sure it will work on the size of pipe you're using.",
        "To attach a plastic pipe to a metal one, you may need a specific adhesive for that specific plastic and specific metal combination, or a mechanical fitting method.",
        "Contact a plumber or hardware store employee for advice.",
        "Follow safe ventilation practices.",
        "Primer and solvent cement release dangerous vapors when used.",
        "Either work in an area with excellent ventilation (large open windows, outdoors, etc.)",
        "or wear a respirator that blocks organic vapor.",
        "File the inside smooth if the pipe was sawed.",
        "Roll 80-grit sandpaper into a tube and sand the inside and outside of the pipe where it will be attached.",
        "The goal is to remove uneven pieces and \"burrs\" created from sawing, which can otherwise catch debris and cause clogs.",
        "Flatten the sandpaper roll against the tube to match its shape before rubbing.",
        "If you don't have sandpaper, use a file or remove the obvious burrs with a pocketknife.",
        "Mark the alignment of the joints if attaching a curved piece.",
        "You won't have much time to arrange the pipes once you've applied the solvent cement, so first fit the pieces together dry.",
        "Turn them to the alignment you need and use a permanent marker to draw a line across them.",
        "Prime pipe before gluing.",
        "Of the three types of plastic pipe, PVC is the only material that requires priming, but CPVC may attach better after priming as well.",
        "Wipe PVC primer or CPVC primer as appropriate onto the outside of the pipe segment and the inside of the pipe fitting, where they will be attached.",
        "Let dry 10 seconds before continuing.",
        "Work quickly and methodically to apply the solvent cement.",
        "Wearing gloves, use a brush or cotton ball to wipe an even layer of solvent cement on the outside of the pipe segment and the inside of the pipe fitting.",
        "Only apply a thin, even layer to the fitting socket or excess may be pushed into the water piping and create blockage.",
        "Connect the pipes immediately and quarter turn from the desired alignment, then twist and hold.",
        "Directly following the application of solvent cement, attach the pipes a quarter turn from the alignment marks you made, then twist them until the marks line up.",
        "If you didn't have to make any alignment marks, simply attach and give a quarter turn twist.",
        "Hold in place for about fifteen seconds to give the cement time to grab.",
        "Correct length mistakes by sawing room for a new joint.",
        "The attachment may shrink slightly when the solvent cement dries.",
        "If your final piece is too short, saw it apart and lengthen it by gluing a new fitting onto it.",
        "If it is too long, remove a section of the pipe entirely by sawing and join the two remaining ends together with a new fitting."
