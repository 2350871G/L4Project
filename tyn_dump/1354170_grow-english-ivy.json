Hardiness zones are categories (based on temperature and location) that determine which plants while grow well in which areas. English ivy is unlikely to thrive outside of hardiness zones 4 to 9. You can determine your hardiness zone by looking in a farmer\u2019s almanac or visiting the USDA website. Locate an area with fertile and well-drained soil. English ivy likes fertile and well-drained soil. Be sure that the area where you intend to place the plant can accommodate this, or consider using a container (where you can control the planting medium). Select an area that needs \u201cground cover.\u201d English ivy is notorious for its ability to spread quickly. Check its status in your area before planting. Look for a wall. Alternatively, you may want your English ivy to climb up a wall, tree, trellis, or other structure. If you live in a brick house, you may even want the ivy to grow and spread over your home. Select a location like this, and plan to plant your ivy nearby. Locate a container. English ivy can spread so quickly that in some places it is considered an invasive species. As such, you may want to start your English ivy in a container. Any planting container with a drainage hole will work fine. Fill this container with planting medium. Starting a New English Ivy Plant Take cuttings from an existing ivy plant in springtime. If you know someone who has an English ivy plant (or if you already have one), begin by taking several 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) clippings. Using a sharp knife (or garden pruners), snip the vines just below a node (the small bump where a leaf grows). Place the cuttings in a glass of water. Place the water in the sun, and leave the budding plant along until you see white root hairs growing out. Rooting the cuttings in water gives you the advantage of seeing how large the roots grow, but it is more difficult to transfer the cuttings to soil once they are large enough. Place the cuttings in soil. Make sure our to is well draining and filled with moist soil. Avoid putting your English ivy in direct sunlight, and what 3-6 weeks for your ivy to finally start rooting. Move the cuttings. If you planted your English ivy cuttings in water, move your plant when the roots are .5\u20131 inch (1.3\u20132.5 cm) long. If you planted your English ivy cuttings in soil, move your plant after 3-6 weeks. Transplanting the Ivy Outdoors Moisten your soil. Using a water bottle, spray down your soil (or planting medium) until it is evenly moistened, but not very wet. Make sure your soil drains well. Find a suitable location. English ivy should not be planted in full sunlight but instead does better in mild shade or indirect sunlight. Poke holes in the ground that are about 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) apart. If you are planting your English ivy as a climbing vine, poke holes that are about 2 feet (0.61 m) away from the wall you want your ivy to grow onto. Water and mulch. English ivy needs to be mulched and watered regularly for optimal growth. Keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy from spring through fall, and then keep it slightly dryer during the winter months. Maintaining the Ivy Water the ivy regularly. English ivy needs about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water every week after the initial planting. This can come from rain or from manual watering. After your ivy is firmly established, you can begin watering less regularly. Fertilize the ivy plant sparingly. You may choose to give your English ivy a small amount of fertilizer in the spring. You should not use more than 2 tbsp. (30 mL) per square foot (.09 square meters) of slow acting nitrogen fertilizer. Prune the ivy. You will want to groom your ivy now and then to maintain a clean and tidy appearance. Simply clip stray branches using garden pruners as necessary to keep the shape and appearance of the ivy that you desire. Cut back well established English ivy beds. Every 3-4 years, you will need to do some more extensive trimming of your established ivy beds. This action will encourage new growth and help your English ivy stay healthy. Spray with soapy water. If you notice your plant is less vibrant (drooping leaves or loss of color), take a close look for aphids or spider mites.
