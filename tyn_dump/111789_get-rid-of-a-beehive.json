        "The bees may confuse your scent for that of flowers.",
        "Choose an insecticide that\u2019s intended for killing bees.",
        "While you can find homemade recipes for eradicating beehives online, your best bet is to use a commercial insecticide.",
        "Go to a home center and pick out an insecticide spray that is marketed for use on bees.",
        "Instead of a spray, you can instead buy an insecticide dusting powder.",
        "The application process will be quite similar regardless.",
        "Spray the insecticide right into the main entry hole of the beehive.",
        "All beehives have a main entry hole that is usually easy to locate.",
        "Hold the nozzle of the spray can right up to the opening and spray for several seconds, until you estimate that you\u2019ve saturated the entire hive interior.",
        "If you\u2019re using an insecticide dust, stick the tip of the applicator into the hole and squeeze the bottle to inject the dust into the hive.",
        "If you can\u2019t find or can\u2019t access the main entry hole, spray the insecticide all over the outside of the hive.",
        "This will do the job eventually, but it will likely take several more spraying applications over a few days.",
        "Repeat the process daily until there\u2019s no more hive activity.",
        "Check the hive the day after spraying it.",
        "If you don\u2019t see any bees enter or exit over a period of 5-10 minutes, the hive is almost certainly eradicated.",
        "Otherwise, spray your chosen insecticide into the hole again and check the following day for activity.",
        "Don\u2019t start removing the hive until all the bees are dead.",
        "Otherwise, they\u2019ll become very aggressive when you tear into their home!",
        "Also, if you\u2019re unable to remove the entire hive, any remaining bees may be able to rebuild it.",
        "Removing the Hive after Killing the Bees Remove all of the empty hive, or at least as much as you can.",
        "Once the spraying is done and you don't see any bees flying in or out of the hive, physically remove the beehive as soon as you can.",
        "Removing the beehive prevents other bees from moving in.",
        "If the hive is attached to a tree limb or underneath a carport, for instance, it should be fairly easy to pull it all down by hand.",
        "If it extends deep into a hollow tree or the side of your house, however, you may have to resort to some fairly significant demolition.",
        "Bring in a professional if you aren\u2019t certain you can handle the job yourself.",
        "Wear the same safety gear as when you sprayed the hive.",
        "There could still be a few angry bees left lurking deep in the hive!",
        "Dispose of the hive in a heavy duty trash bag.",
        "Use a contractor-grade trash bag or 2 thick trash bags to to dispose of the beehive.",
        "Once you place the beehive (whole or in pieces) in the trash bag, securely tie the bag.",
        "Place it in the trash container and put it out for trash pickup.",
        "Securely bag up the hive as soon as you can, so other bees aren\u2019t tempted to move in.",
        "Never try to collect any honey from a hive after you\u2019ve sprayed it with insecticide!",
        "Scrub away any remnants of the hive, especially against your home.",
        "It's important to clean the area once the beehive is removed.",
        "Beehives are full of bacteria, and any remaining hive structure and bee corpses will rot and smell foul.",
        "Scrub the area with soap and water for the best results.",
        "Make sure all of the hive and honey is removed whenever possible.",
        "Honey and dead bees may attract other bees, wax moths, or ants.",
        "Do not leave sections of a hive within the structure of your home.",
        "Even if you seal it off so bees can\u2019t get back in, the hive will rot and smell bad.",
        "Also, the wax will eventually melt and can damage the wiring or structure of your home.",
        "Seal off the area so a new hive can\u2019t be built there.",
        "If you leave the area open, future swarms of bees may build beehives in the same spot.",
        "If the hive was in a tree trunk, for instance, use expanding spray foam, caulk, or even concrete to block off the opening.",
        "If the hive was against your home, garage, or other structure, patch up any damage and seal any openings in the area.",
        "Hire a professional to repair the structure if you\u2019re not capable of doing it yourself.",
        "Unfortunately, large beehives can cause major structural damage to homes.",
        "That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to deal with a beehive that\u2019s against your home as soon as you notice it."
