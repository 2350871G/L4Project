Apply the glue to your canvas with a small brush using short strokes. Then, leave it to dry for about 12 hours. If you\u2019re using an oil paint, you\u2019ll definitely need to size your canvas before you apply your primer. If you\u2019re painting with acrylic, sizing the canvas is optional. You can buy sizing glue at any art supply store that also sells gesso."
