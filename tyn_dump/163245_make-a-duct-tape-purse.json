Peel the sheet off, flip it over, and over the back with more overlapping strips of duct tape. This size should fit most bags. If your bag is smaller, then make your duct tape sheet smaller.

For a nicer finish, cut the top and bottom corners of the tape off first; be careful not to cut into the actual pocket, however. Making a Simple Clutch Lay down several overlapping strips of duct tape. Cut a 12-inch (30-cm) strip of duct tape and lay it sticky-side-down horizontally across your cutting mat.

        "Stick them onto a cutting mat, overlapping the long edges by \u20444 inch (0.64 cm).",
        "Peel the sheet off, flip it over, and over the back with more overlapping strips of duct tape.",
        "This size should fit most bags.",
        "If your bag is smaller, then make your duct tape sheet smaller.",
        "Secure the pocket to the inside of your bag.",
        "Cut 3 strips of duct tape.",
        "Secure the strips to both of the narrow side edges and the bottom long edge of your duct tape pocket.",
        "Trim off any excess duct tape from the top  long edge, then secure the pocket to the inside of your bag.",
        "Place the pocket a few inches/centimeters from the top edge of your bag.",
        "For a nicer finish, cut the top and bottom corners of the tape off first; be careful not to cut into the actual pocket, however.",
        "Making a Simple Clutch Lay down several overlapping strips of duct tape.",
        "Cut a 12-inch (30-cm) strip of duct tape and lay it sticky-side-down horizontally across your cutting mat.",
        "Lay down more 12-inch (30-cm) strips of duct tape to make a 10 by 12-inch (25 by 30-cm) rectangle.",
        "Overlap each strip by \u20444 inch (0.64 cm).",
        "This side will be the outside of your purse.",
        "Patterned duct tape would work great for this.",
        "You can also cut the strips a little longer than 12 inches (30 cm).",
        "This way, you can trim off any unevenness without sacrificing length.",
        "Flip the  duct tape sheet over and lay down more strips on the back.",
        "Peel the duct tape sheet off of the cutting mat, then flip it over so that the sticky side is facing up.",
        "Cut more 12-inch (30-cm) strips of duct tape, and lay them across the sheet to cover up the sticky side.",
        "Be sure to overlap them like before.",
        "Start peeling the duct tape sheet up starting from the first piece of tape you set down.",
        "This will prevent the sheet from coming apart.",
        "Offset the first and last strip by \u20444 inch (0.64 cm).",
        "This way, the overlapping seams won't be on top of each other and create bulk.",
        "This will be the inside of the purse.",
        "Use a contrasting pattern or a solid color for this side.",
        "Use a metal ruler and a craft blade to trim the duct tape sheet down.",
        "You need the final sheet to be 10 by 12 inches (25 by 30 cm).",
        "Trim off any unevenness on the side edges using a metal ruler and a craft blade.",
        "If you off-set the strips of duct tape on the back of the sheet, fold the top and bottom edges over so that the sticky side isn't showing anymore.",
        "Fold the narrow, bottom edge up by 4 \u20442 inches (11 cm).",
        "Turn the sheet so that one of the narrow edges is facing you.",
        "Make sure that the side you want to be on the inside is facing up, then fold the bottom 10-inch (25-cm) edge up by 4 \u20442 inches (11 cm).",
        "Run your fingernail along the bottom crease to sharpen it.",
        "The remaining 3 inches (7.6 cm) sticking out over the top will eventually make the flap so that you can close the purse.",
        "Tape side edges down to create an envelope.",
        "Cut two 4 1\u20442-inch (11-cm) strips of duct tape.",
        "Lay a strip down each side of the folded purse, making sure that the bottom edges match up.",
        "Fold the rest of the strip over onto the back of the purse.",
        "Do not get any tape on the top 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the sheet.",
        "Fold the top 3 inches (7.6 cm) down to make the flap.",
        "Run your fingernail across the top crease to sharpen it.",
        "If you want to, you can cut the top flap into a V or U shape for a fancier touch.",
        "Make sure that you cut from corner-to-corner for a nicer finish.",
        "Add a trim to the edges using a contrasting color, if desired.",
        "Open up your purse first.",
        "Measure the edge that you want to decorate, then cut a strip of duct tape accordingly.",
        "Place the tape along the edge, then fold it over onto the back.",
        "Consider decorating the bottom and side edges of the flap as well as the side edges of the purse.",
        "You can cut the duct tape strips in half lengthwise to make them thinner.",
        "Add self-adhesive Velcro dots for the closure.",
        "Unfold the top flap.",
        "Place a self-adhesive Velcro dot along the center of the top edge.",
        "Place the matching Velcro dot on top of it, adhesive-side-up.",
        "Close the flap and press down on the closure securely so that the dot sticks to the bottom.",
        "Carefully pry open the flap and press the dots into place, if needed.",
        "Make sure that you add the Velcro after you add the trimming.",
        "If you do it before, you may end up covering up the Velcro.",
        "Decorate the purse with shapes cut out of duct tape, if desired.",
        "Buy a pre-made sheet of duct tape, or lay down a strip of duct tape on a piece of wax paper.",
        "Use a craft blade or a pair of scissors to cut out fun shapes, such as hearts, moons, or stars.",
        "Peel the tape off from the backing/wax paper, and stick it onto your purse."
