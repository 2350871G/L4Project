Get Levi's 501s, rustler jeans or any straight-legged, slim (not skinny), or boot-cut jeans, and cuff either 1\u20134 inches (2.5\u201310.2 cm) or degrees for cold weather. If you have a school uniform that's not strict, you could wear Levi\u2019s tan jeans, and shirt (even with sweater vest) you could roll the sleeves up, or wear a jacket, crop your pants, and wear chucks or, if you have to, dress shoes or motorcycle boots. For girls get skinny blue jeans and roll them up or wear leather pants. Buy Dickie's work shirts, fitted t-shirts of any colour (roll-up sleeves, but this is not a requirement), western shirts, bowling shirts, slim fit suits with a bola or plain tees of any colour. Get a Dickies or Levi\u2019s work jacket, denim, windbreaker, or a leather jacket (any colour), and for work out or exercise, you could wear khaki shorts, a tee-shirt, and Chuck Taylor's or timberland boots. Timberlands are also good for everyday wear. In the winter wear leather bomber jackets."

You can make your own combinations, again as long as it shows that you are a greaser. If you don't want long hair you can get a short crew cut, or for black people, a shirt version if a hightop fade, those hairstyles were also popular in the 1950s, and keep in mind the term \"greaser\" didn't actually exist in the '50s. Another option is to get a stingy brim fedora or a paperboy hat. Make sure it's a real fedora made of feeling with a shiny band around it tied into a bow or a leather cap."
