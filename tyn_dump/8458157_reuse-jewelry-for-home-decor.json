Small disc magnet backs work best for this project. Superglue the magnet backs on your earrings and then place them on your fridge to spruce up your kitchen. You should use pliers to remove any wires or backs that are still on the jewelry. This works best on larger jewelry. Small earrings, like gold balls, may look awkward glued to a magnet back."

If you have a decorative box sitting out on a mantel or elsewhere in your home, it may look a little dull. Try to add a little extra decoration by super-gluing an earring to the box. If you have a lot of earrings you no longer use, glue a lot of them to a decorative box. You can try to make a design, like a heart shape, or simply scatter jewels all over the front of the box."

They can also be glued to hanging pieces of a mobile to give them extra flare. Earrings can make a run-of-the-mill mobile sparkle in your home. For example, if you have a mobile of the sun, moon, and stars, superglue shiny earrings to the hanging pieces. This will make the cosmos shine a little."

If you don't have a table runner, but do have a lot of old earrings, consider springing for a inexpensive fabric runner at a department store.
