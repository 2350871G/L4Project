While you\u2019re first learning how to ink, it will be better to start with simpler drawings with clean pencil line work and fewer details.

You\u2019ll be better served if you wait until after you\u2019ve inked the major lines to start adding extra touches. The pencil lines of your sketch should be precise and clearly defined.

Hold your hand steady and let your arm guide you over the lines, rather than trying to use the movement of your wrist alone. Relax your drawing hand and arm; too much tension can leave your finished drawing looking rigid and lifeless. Gripping the pen near the tip, close to the paper itself, will keep it more stable than holding it higher up near the middle. You'll make fewer mistakes, and what small mistakes you do make will be less pronounced. Maintaining a sharp angle between the pen and paper helps pull ink out of the pen more efficiently, resulting in smooth, fluid line work."

Most artists achieve the best results by inking in the direction of their dominant hand (if you're right handed, starting on the left side of the page and inking to the right, and the opposite for left handed artists). This will prevent you from running the edge of your hand over fresh lines. After you\u2019ve inked the major lines, move outward and fill in smaller details and those in the background.

When you come to a section of the drawing that's difficult to ink, turn the paper and continue in the same orientation, rather than contorting your hand or trying to ink in an uncomfortable direction. Keep the final image in mind when inking your drawing. If you\u2019re just following the same lines you sketched, the objects will look forced and crude.

Using various layers, thicknesses and shades of ink in different parts of the drawing will allow you to play with the way light is depicted. Ink is advantageous because it can be used to easily manipulate light and shadow, which will help round out the dimensions of the drawing. As a rule, the parts of an object that are furthest from a light source need to be shaded more to deepen shadows, whereas leaving an area unshaded will suggest brightness.

        "EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKelly Medford\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProfessional Artist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKelly Medford is an American painter based in Rome, Italy.",
        "She studied classical painting, drawing and printmaking both in the U.S. and in Italy.",
        "She works primarily en plein air on the streets of Rome, and also travels for private international collectors on commission.",
        "She founded Sketching Rome Tours in 2012 where she teaches sketchbook journaling to visitors of Rome.",
        "Kelly is a graduate of the Florence Academy of Art.",
        "Kelly Medford\t\t\tProfessional Artist\t\t\t\tInk from one side of the page to the other from top-to-bottom.",
        "Working in one direction, either left-to-right or right-to-left, and then from the top of the page to the bottom will keep you from smearing the wet ink or smudging pencil lines.",
        "Adjust your ink line work.",
        "With your first pass at inking complete, look for places where you line work can be touched up.",
        "Go over key lines a second and even third time to thicken and smooth them out.",
        "Try adding realistic perspective by leaving the lines thin where they face an imagined light source, and thickening them where they\u2019re further away.",
        "Tweak your inked lines until you\u2019re satisfied with how they look.",
        "Use a thin nib (the interchangeable tip of a dip pen) and light ink for the initial outline and thicken lines later as you go.",
        "Give the ink a few minutes to dry before you start adding detail or going over lines a second time.",
        "Developing Style and Technique Add texture.",
        "Finish your drawing by inking small details and embellishments that give scope to its forms and lend an element of realism.",
        "Techniques like hatching (drawing a series of thin parallel lines close together), crosshatching (hatching in a grid-like pattern) and stippling (making closely-grouped small dots) can help bring your drawing to life by making it more engaging to the eye.",
        "These skills are a unique way of representing depth and texture in two dimensional art.",
        "Hatching, crosshatching and stippling are useful when you want to create the effect of texture without having to use an excessive amount of ink coloring in empty space.",
        "Don\u2019t go too crazy adding textural elements.",
        "If overdone, it can end up looking chaotic.",
        "Make use of tone, contrast and shadow.",
        "Fill in around the edges of objects to provide contrast.",
        "Using various layers, thicknesses and shades of ink in different parts of the drawing will allow you to play with the way light is depicted.",
        "Ink is advantageous because it can be used to easily manipulate light and shadow, which will help round out the dimensions of the drawing.",
        "As a rule, the parts of an object that are furthest from a light source need to be shaded more to deepen shadows, whereas leaving an area unshaded will suggest brightness.",
        "The more realistic the drawing, the greater amount of shading and toning it will require.",
        "Ink with the completed drawing in mind.",
        "Not every drawing will be inked the same way.",
        "Before jumping right into the inking process, think about which tools you\u2019ll need to properly highlight the contours of the rough drawing you\u2019ve done.",
        "You can also start thinking about how you might enhance the drawing with detailing techniques.",
        "Cartoons tend to look better with thick, bold outer lines, while the line work of realistic drawings varies and is often dictated by lighting and perspective.",
        "A drawing that you plan on coloring will not need too much interior detail, as it will get in the way.",
        "Develop your own style.",
        "Figure out which techniques you like most, and which feel best, for your particular art style.",
        "Decide whether you prefer to grip the pen tightly or take a loose, free approach; learn how much pressure to put on the paper to make your lines look the way you want them to.",
        "Just as everyone draws a little differently, no two people will ink in exactly the same way, either.",
        "Your inking methods should closely match and complement your freehand drawing style.",
        "Because of the way you naturally make strokes, your drawing and inking techniques should be very similar.",
        "Choosing the Right Tools Use a pen or brush for different purposes.",
        "Select an inking tool that will let you trace, fill, shade and employ other techniques as you please.",
        "Most artists prefer pens for conventional line work, as it goes on bold and straight.",
        "An inking brush might also be used, especially for filling large areas and when you want to taper the width of a line mid-stroke.",
        "You should pick the pen or brush that will let you achieve the effect you\u2019re trying to create.",
        "Test out different pen nibs so that you\u2019ll have a several available to you when you need them.",
        "The nib is the interchangeable tip of the pen that comes into contact with the paper and deploys ink.",
        "Pens can work as all-purpose inking tools, but a brush can save you time when it comes to shading tasks.",
        "Find a suitable ink.",
        "It\u2019s usually best to experiment with several kinds of ink to find one that you can work well with.",
        "If you\u2019re using a traditional fountain pen for inking, you\u2019ll be able to dip it in an ink of your choice.",
        "Inks come in different shades and thickness, and some are better suited for certain drawing tasks than others.",
        "For some projects, you might even use more than one type of ink on the same drawing.",
        "India ink is a reliable standard choice for artists, as it is dark, waterproof and permanent.",
        "If you\u2019re using prepackaged or commercial grade pens that contain their own ink, switch them out when you need to change how thick or dark your lines are.",
        "Choose a paper that will hold up to inking.",
        "Before you start inking, examine and feel the paper you\u2019re using.",
        "Is it thick or thin?",
        "Smooth or rough?",
        "Ink will settle into different papers in a unique way.",
        "Get in the habit of thinking about paper and ink together.",
        "Make sure you\u2019re not using a rough, soft paper with a thin ink, for example, or the ink may bleed.",
        "Browse your local arts supply store for high-quality papers that are designed specifically for inking.",
        "You should also be sure to draw on a flat, solid surface and work at an angle that\u2019s most comfortable for you Mix and match your materials.",
        "Don\u2019t forget that you have the option of playing around with all sorts of pens, brushes, papers, and ink.",
        "Some artists prefer a simpler process, and may only ever use one type of each of these materials, but the combinations are nearly endless.",
        "The tools and mediums to you decide on will have an effect on the way your finished drawing turns out.",
        "Put together an artist\u2019s toolkit so that you\u2019ll have a greater number of implements at your disposal.",
        "Part of becoming a better artist is discovering what works best for your individual style."
