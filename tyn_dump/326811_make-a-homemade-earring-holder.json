    "text": " Using a Box Lid Wrap a box lid with a colorful piece of wrapping paper. Secure the paper under the lid with wrapping paper. If the lid is small enough, you can use scrapbooking paper instead. Cut a pair of white or black nylons 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) longer than your lid. If your paper is a light color, use white nylons. If your paper is a dark color, use black nylons. Cut the nylons towards the top, where they are wider. This will ensure that they are wide enough for your lid. If you can find colored nylons, choose a color that matches your wrapping paper. For example, use green nylons if you have green wrapping paper. For a fancier earring holder, use lacey nylons instead. Place the lid inside the nylons. Try to center it as much as possible, so that there are 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of nylon hanging off to either side of the lid. Fold the ends of the nylons to the back of the lid, and secure them with hot glue. You don't have to worry about being too neat; this will be the back of your earring holder, and invisible once you hang it. Cut a piece of ribbon that matches your earring holder. Measure the width of your lid, then cut a piece of ribbon according to that measurement. Form a loop with the ribbon, and glue the ends to the back of your earring holder. To make the loop more secure, tie the ends of the ribbon into a knot first, then glue it down. Hang your earring holder. Your holder is now ready to use. You can now stick your hook earrings through the nylons. Using a Frame and Plastic Canvas Find a wooden frame and take out the backing and glass panel. You can discard the backing, but save the glass panel. You will be using it to trace the plastic canvas/mesh later. You can use a plain frame, or an ornate one. Paint the frame and let it dry. You can use spray paint or acrylic paint. Be sure to get the back and sides of the frame as well. Depending on how dark your frame is, or how light the paint is, you may need two coats of paint. Let the first layer dry before adding the second one. Consider decorating the frame further, especially if it is a plain frame. You can leave your frame plain as it is, or you can decorate it further to make it more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nGlue some plastic gems or rhinestones along the frame\nDraw some designs on the frame using black, gold, or silver permanent marker\nPaint some bold designs on the frame, such as stripes, stars, or hearts\nDraw designs on the frame using glitter glue Use a marker to trace the glass panel onto a sheet of plastic canvas. Plastic canvas looks like a plastic mesh or screen. It is stiff, and used to wave designs onto with yarn. Choose a color that matches your frame, or goes well with it. Cut the plastic canvas/mesh out. Be sure cut along the lines, or it may fall through your frame. Glue the mesh to the back of your frame. Flip your frame over so that the back is facing you. Draw a line of glue all along the inside edges of the frame, where the glass panel used to rest. Quickly press the plastic canvas into the glue. You can use hot glue or an industrial-strength (such as E6000) for this. Don't use regular school glue; it won't be strong enough. Cut a piece of ribbon. Choose a color that matches your frame, then cut it down so that it matches your frame's width. Make a loop from the ribbon, then glue it to the back of your frame. Tie the ends of the ribbon together to make a knot. Place some glue on the back of your frame, near the top, then press the knot into the glue. If your frame has a metal bracket for hanging, you can thread the ribbon through this bracket. You can also hang the frame from the wall using just the bracket. If you don't want to hang your earring holder, get a frame stand instead, and set the frame down onto it instead. Wait for the glue to dry, then hang your earring holder. You can now stick earrings into the mesh. This works well with hook and post earrings. When attaching post earrings, you will need to take the back off the earring first, push the earring through the mesh, then put the back on again. Using an Embroidery Hoop and Lace Take an embroidery hoop apart. Find the metal knob, and twist it until the outer loop expands. Pop the inner loop out. If you wish to paint your embroidery hoop, twist the knob until it comes out. Place the knob and bolt part some place safe. Paint the hoops, if desired, and wait for the paint to dry. You can use acrylic paint or spray paint. If your hoop is made from plastic, it might be better to leave it the original color; paint scratches off plastic easily. If your hoop is made from wood, you can paint it any color you'd like. You can also leave it blank, if you'd like something more rustic. Cut a piece of lace or tulle a few inches larger than your hoop. You will trim off the excess fabric after you put the hoop back together. Place the lace on top of the inner hoop. Try to center the lace as much as possible. There should be equal amounts of fabric hanging off the edges of your hoop. Place the upper hoop on top, and tighten it. If you took the knob and bolt off, you will need to put them back in. Place the screw part of the knob through both holes on the metal clasp. Once you have it through, place the bolt at the end of the screw. Start tightening the knob and bolt until the outer hoop closes and you can't tighten it anymore. Trim off the excess lace using a pair of fabric scissors. Try to cut as close to the hoop as possible. Thread some ribbon through the metal closure, and tie it in a knot. Choose some ribbon that matches your earring holder, and cut it. Thread it through the metal closure, right under the screw, and tie the ends in a knot. To hide the knot, rotate the ribbon until the knot is at the bottom. It will rest inside the closure, between the screw and the hoop. Hang and use your earring holder. You can now stick earrings through the tulle or lace. This works best with hook earrings.",
