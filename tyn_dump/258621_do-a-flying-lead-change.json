Aim for a smooth and controlled canter that follows a steady, 3-beat rhythm. Your horse in the canter should be making big, round, expressive strides and have plenty of lift off the ground so it can successfully change its legs in the air. As you are cantering, use pressure from your outside leg and outside rein to keep your horse going straight. Put tension on the inside rein to flex your horse slightly in the direction of the lead."

Ride several straight strides on the long side of the arena and then turn in diagonally towards the center. When you\u2019ve come to 50\u201380 feet (15\u201324 m) from the rail, bring your horse onto the center line, pressing with your left leg to keep it on a right lead. Turn slightly to the left, keeping your horse bending to the right by pressing your right leg against the girth and your left leg behind it. Your horse should turn towards the left with its haunches towards the rail and continue cantering on the right lead. If your horse breaks into a trot during the turn, start over and give more pressure with your legs on the next turn to keep it cantering. If your horse changes to a left lead in the front as you turn, ask it to come down to a trot by pulling gently back on the reins and try again. Turn your head and look where you are turning to prepare your horse to make a gradual swing in that direction. Practice counter cantering both ways until your horse can do it without tension."

Pull back on the reins to ask your horse to transition down into a trot. After 1-3 strides, press your left leg into your horse at the girth while keeping your right leg against its body just behind the girth to keep it going straight ahead to encourage it to switch to leading with its right leg. Use the inside rein to flex it to the left, in the direction of the new lead. When it switches, bring it back to a canter and repeat the process on the other side. To help you follow the gait change with your hips without losing your balance, keep your core engaged and close your fingers tightly on the outside rein when you ask your horse to come down to a trot. You can also progress to making a lead change from canter to a walk and then back to canter. It helps to slow down the canter with a few collecting half halts before you pull back on the reins to ask your horse to transition to a walk."

Do some simple lead changes in the middle of the figure eight to warm up before you attempt the flying lead change. Give the cue to change when your horse\u2019s leading leg is coming forward. Even though the lead change happens when all four of your horse\u2019s legs are suspending in the air, give the cue early, just as you see the leading leg coming forward.

Each time you see it, say \u201cnow,\u201d out loud to yourself. Try the same technique in the canter. Apply pressure with your right leg and release the tension on the left rein. Bring your horse to a canter on the left lead. Push your right seat bone forward towards your horse\u2019s right ear. You should feel your horse moving a bit to the left. Release the pressure on the right and apply pressure behind the girl with the left leg. Strike firmly and swiftly just behind the girth on the left side. Loosen up on the right rein to give more space for the new inside front leg to come forward. Don\u2019t hold back with the left leg. This part of the cue should be very quick to get your horse to change. Correcting Mistakes Help your horse relax before trying lead changes. If your horse feels a little tense, pull back on the reins a bit to bring it down to a trot. Stroke it occasionally on the neck.
