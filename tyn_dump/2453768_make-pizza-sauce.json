        "Add salt and pepper to the sauce for additional flavor.",
        "Turn off the food processor and sprinkle in as much salt and pepper as you would like.",

        "Use the pesto immediately or freeze it for later.",
        "If you're putting the pesto on your pizza dough immediately, stir in 0.5  c (120 ml) of freshly grated Parmesan cheese before spreading it on the dough.",
