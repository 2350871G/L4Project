Neutral colored clothes should be your bread and butter.

Nearby colors like indigo and purple harmonize nicely too. Mix and match colors until you find an outfit that pleases the eye. Remember to match the color of your shoes to the color of your outfit.

Too many accessories can make it look like you're trying too hard. Aim for one or two matching accessories per outfit. Don't over match your accessories. If you're wearing a mainly blue outfit, avoid blue accessories. You can match the color of your accessory to one of the understated colors of your outfit.
