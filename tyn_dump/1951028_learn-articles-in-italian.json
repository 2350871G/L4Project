Indefinite: indeterminativo (/in-de-ter-mi-na-ti-vo/). Singular: il singolare (/il/ /sin-go-la-re/, m). Plural: il plurale (/il/ /plu-ra-le/, m). Know that in Italian language nouns have genders. That is they are considered as being feminine (shown by letter f ) or masculine (shown by letter m). Note that some languages have neutral, but Italian has no neutral. A noun might not be recognized at first whether being feminine or masculine but that word will be forced into one of the categories. Recognize gender Recognize easily genders from the face of the words as, Feminine singular: Any noun ends to letter 'a' is femminile.
