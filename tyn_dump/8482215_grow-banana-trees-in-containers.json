When purchasing a banana tree, make sure that you go for a dwarf variety of tree. These trees only grow to around 1.5 m (5 feet) to 4 m (13 feet), can be grown indoors, and will not outgrow the pot that you put them in.

When your tree starts to grow fruit it will need to be pruned again. After harvesting the fruit, cut down the tree so it's 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) from the ground, without damaging the main sucker.
