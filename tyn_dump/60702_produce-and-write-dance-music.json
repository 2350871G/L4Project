The main ones are Trance, House, Drum n Bass, Garage, Hip Hop, UK/Happy Hardcore and more. There are plenty of other totally different types of sub genres to these. Don't be limited by genres and pop charts look for new artists and experiment."

            "description": "The beat holds the song together and controls how good the music is. To make a good beat, listen to dance music and try to pick out the characteristics of the drums only. Dance music is almost always in 4/4  such as Galvanize by The Chemical Brothers in which they throw in a 2/4 bar every few instrumental measures. Hi hat sounds good with straight eighth notes or sixteenths. Snare drum is used to accent and syncopate the beat. Try to use electronic snare and stay away from the clap, because that is used a lot in hip-hop."

Also, you can make it in a rock format with a verse and a chorus. Finally, you can take out your 40 year old nursery rhymes or favorite Robert Frost poem and read or sing it! It's up to you."
