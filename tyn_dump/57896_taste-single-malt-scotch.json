The Lowlands: The Lowlands region produces lighter, fresher scotches. Speyside: Scotch produced in Speyside tends to have fruity flavors. The Highlands: The Highlands region distills scotches with all different flavors. Campbeltown: Campbeltown produces distinct and enduring Scotch from the 3 distilleries in the region."
