        "The water and salt are necessary components of the brine, but you can alter the flavor if desired by adding 1/4 cup (60 ml) sugar or 1/4 cup (60 ml) sili (small chili peppers).",
        "Peel and slice the mangoes.",
        "The flesh of each green mango needs to be cut into fat, long slivers.",
        "After rinsing and drying each mango, peel off the skin using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler.",
        "Cut each mango into three flat pieces.",
        "Two of the pieces should hold nothing but the flesh, while the third middle piece will contain the pit or seed.",
        "Use a knife the shave away the flesh of this middle piece away from the seed.",
        "You should be able to get two long slivers from this section alone.",
        "Cut the flesh from the remaining sections into fat slivers.",
        "Place the slices in a large jar.",
        "Arrange the mango pieces in a large glass jar.",
        "The pieces should be packed closely enough to keep them upright, but there should also be gaps between them.",
        "If you have a large enough jar, you can keep the slices in one jar.",
        "Otherwise, you may need to use several smaller jars.",
        "Make sure that each jar is clean and dry before using it.",
        "Pour the brine over the mango slices.",
        "Pour the cooled salt brine over the mango slices.",
        "Make sure that the slices are completely covered, but leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar.",
        "It is essential that the brine cools to room temperature before you pour it over the mango slices.",

        "In fact, for this type of buro, it is best if you leave the lid a little loose.",
        "Store in the refrigerator.",
        "After three days pass, you should tighten the lid of the jar and store the buro in your refrigerator.",
        "When stored in the refrigerator, the buro should last for about one month.",
        "You could also try storing the buro in your freezer.",
