Continue wrapping the dental floss towards the tip of the rope. Pull out more dental floss as needed and continue to wrap it tightly around the loop and the rope. Work in small, parallel layers to work your way from the bottom of the loop to the top of the rope. Tear off 6\u20138 in (15\u201320 cm) of floss from the spool and pull it through the loop at the top. Use the serrated edge on the box of floss to tear the floss off so that at least 6 inches (15 cm) of floss remains. Grab the standing end you\u2019ve just torn off and carefully thread it through the small portion of the loop at the top of the whipping. Once you slide it through the loop, pull it all the way through and tug gently on it to ensure that it is tight. The tighter the floss is, the more secure your rope will be. Just be careful about ripping the floss while you do this. Tug on the small amount of floss sticking out at the bottom. There should still be 4 inches (10 cm) of floss sticking out at the bottom of the whipping. Grab this length of floss and pull it down.

Since you\u2019re pulling the rope underneath the wrapping, you can\u2019t actually see how far you\u2019re pulling it. To keep it roughly in the middle, only pull the floss down 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) based on how big your original loop was. Trim the remaining dental floss using scissors to finish tying the end off. Once the loop is tucked underneath the wrapping, the end of your rope is completely secure and will not fray. Use a pair of scissors or a utility knife to trim the excess floss off at the top and the bottom. If the whipping ever comes undone, you can always repeat this process.

        "Continue cutting until you\u2019ve removed the last bit of the working end entirely.",
        "The standing end of the rope refers to the long length leading away from the end.",
        "The end that you\u2019re cutting or tying off is known as the working end.",
        "Use a butane torch or lighter to heat the end of the rope for 3-5 seconds.",
        "Lift the rope up in your nondominant hand and keep your hand 12\u201316 inches (30\u201341 cm) away from the end.",
        "If you\u2019re using a torch, point it 5\u20136 inches (13\u201315 cm) away from the end that you\u2019re cauterizing and slowly move it closer until the tip begins to burn.",
        "If you\u2019re using a lighter, hold the rope 5\u20136 inches (13\u201315 cm) above the flame and slowly lower the rope until it starts to burn.Tip: Since electrical tape is resistant to fire, the fibers will burn in place and fuse together.",
        "If you do this without electrical tape, the strands of rope may fray outwards as they burn.",
        "A butane torch will do a better job of cauterizing the fibers, but you can use a lighter if you don\u2019t have one.",
        "The butane torch will heat the fibers more evenly and will result in a cleaner fusion at the end of the rope.",
        "Keep the flame at least 12 inches (30 cm) away from the flame of your butane torch.",
        "Point the flame away from you and do not do this near any flammable materials.",
        "Blow any flames out and tap the end of the rope with a thick leather glove.",
        "Release the torch or lighter after heating the end of the rope for 3-5 seconds.",
        "If there is an open flame on the rope itself, blow it out.",
        "The end of your rope should now look black and burnt.",
        "Tap the burnt end of the rope against a thick leather glove to push the melted fibers together.",
        "Let the end of the rope cool for 15-30 seconds to finish cauterizing it.",
        "If your rope ever gets wet, the electrical tape may fall off.",
        "Your rope will be unlikely to fray even if this happens, though.",
        "You don\u2019t need to put the glove on if you\u2019re handling a small rope.",
        "You can simply dab the burnt end gently against the leather.",
        "Cutting Synthetic Rope with a Hot Knife Use a hot knife to cut rope and avoid fraying in the future.",
        "A hot knife is basically an electric knife with a blade that heats up.",
        "They have a thin rod at the end that gets hot enough to melt materials.",
        "Using a hot knife to cut your synthetic rope is the best way to avoid fraying in the future.Tip: You can use a hot knife on any kind of synthetic rope.",
        "It basically cauterizes the rope as you\u2019re cutting it.",
        "This will not work with natural fiber ropes for the same reason the electrical tape and torch won\u2019t work.",
        "The fibers will simply split when they get too hot.",
        "You can purchase a hot knife online or from a construction supply store for $25-50.",
        "Set a piece of glass or tile under the rope to create a cutting board.",
        "Since the hot knife will singe rubber, plastic, or wood surfaces, put a piece of thick glass or tile under the rope.",
        "This way, if your hot knife\u2019s blade hits the surface underneath, it won\u2019t damage the table or cutting surface.",
        "Don\u2019t use a piece of tile that is laminated or coated in plastic.",
        "The plastic coating may melt when you touch it with your knife.",
        "Press the trigger and let the knife heat up for 5-10 seconds.",
        "Plug your hot knife in to an outlet and set your rope down over your glass or tile cutting board.",
        "Pull the trigger on the knife to start heating the blade.",
        "Wait 5-10 seconds to give your hot knife time to heat up.",
        "Hot knives tend to reach their peak temperature pretty quickly.",
        "Push the blade against the rope and slowly melt through it.",
        "Keep the trigger on the hot knife pressed down.",
        "Carefully press the blade against the top of the rope where you want to cut it.",
        "The rope will begin melting and separating.",
        "Continue gently pushing the blade downwards while moving the blade slowly back and forth until you\u2019ve completed your cut.",
        "Set the hot knife down on its side for 20-30 seconds to give it time to cool.",
        "Gently moving the blade back and forth as you cut will ensure that you heat the rope evenly as you cut through it."
