Use these covers to create a barrier between your skin and the toilet seat, which may help you from coming in contact with bacteria. These covers are usually on the wall of the restroom or in holders in each bathroom stall. If there is any material on the seat, or it is wet, wipe it off with some toilet paper before you place the cover on the toilet. Place the cover with the center tab hanging down into the water so that it flushes away after use. Consider carrying a personal single-use toilet seat cover for situations when no cover is available."

Consider resealing the toilet twice if you notice any material in the toilet. Some studies show that water from the flushing toilet may spray the plastic cover, making it less hygienic."
