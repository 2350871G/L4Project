While LED lamps may be less harmful than UV lights, they do emit some potentially harmful rays. Therefore, it\u2019s important to take precautions to ensure that your skin isn\u2019t damaged as your polish cures. You can buy professional nail gloves made out of a special polymer that contains titanium dioxide, a sun-protecting ingredient found in many sunscreens. You can also use regular fingerless gloves. While they might not protect as well as professional nail gloves, they will protect your skin to a degree. LED lamps are generally preferable to UV lights because they cure polish in 45 seconds, versus the 8 or 9 minutes it takes a UV light. However, because they do still emit UV rays, it\u2019s important to wear gloves or sunscreen to protect your skin as much as possible."
