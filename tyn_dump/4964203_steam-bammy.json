The peel of the cassava is very thick and covered in a wax-like coating, so you won't be able to use a vegetable peeler to remove it. When using fresh cassava, make sure that you use the sweet variety usually sold in a market, not the bitter variety. Cassava contains toxic substances. In sweet cassava, those substances are concentrated in the peel. In bitter cassava, those substances are evenly spread throughout the flesh, as well.

After handling the cassava peel, make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water. Rinse the peeled cassava under running water, as well. Grate the root into fine shreds. Scrape the cut end of each cassava chunk against a box grater to shred it into thin strips. Wring out the excess moisture. Place the grated cassava in a clean dish towel. Close the towel up, then wring out as much juice as possible using your hands. Removing most of the juice will also further reduce the amount of toxins in the cassava. The amount of juice you'll be left with after thoroughly wringing it out should not pose a threat. Discard the juice down the drain of your sink. Thoroughly rinse the sink out afterward.

Browning is not strictly necessary, but it is recommended. Broil both sides of the bammy, if desired. Remove the bammy from the skillet and transfer each disc to a broiler pan. Place the broiler pan in the preheated broiler for a few minutes, or until both sides are lightly toasted. You will need to turn the bammy halfway through the broiling process. Each side will need about 2 minutes to brown. Serve warm. Remove the bammy from the skillet or the broiler pan, and enjoy it while it is still fresh and hot. Heat the oil in a skillet. Pour the oil in a large skillet and heat it on medium-high for a minute or two. The oil should become glossy and thin. Turn the pan gently to make sure that the entire bottom is coated in oil.
