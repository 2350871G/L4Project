        "This is one of the few cases where \u201cretail therapy,\u201d is not just a joke.",
        "The clothes you wear have a significant impact on how you look and feel, accentuating your favorite qualities and downplaying those that make you self-conscience.",
        "The only way to know what you like is to go try stuff on, and the experience alone is a great way to have fun in your body and look at yourself in a sexy new light.",
        "Choose one part of your look you want to change, just one, and get to work.",
        "Being happy with your body doesn't mean you don't want it to change -- and even the happiest people are comfortable enough to say, \"I know I can improve.\"",
        "That's because working on something and seeing growth is one of the best ways to improve your self esteem.",
        "Maybe you want to cut some belly fat, or clear your skin up, or work on your posture.",
        "This seems daunting all at once, but by themselves each goal is much more manageable.",
        "And, once conquered, the other goals will only get easier, too.",
        "Having a plan makes all issues and worries much easier to get your head around.",
        "Learn to quickly flip negative thoughts on their heads, turning them into something more positive.",
        "Thoughts like \u201cI\u2019m lazy and useless,\u201d \u201cno one will ever find me attractive,\u201d or \u201cI hate my body\u201d are not only hurtful and wrong, they create traps of self-doubt that it is very hard to climb out of.",
        "The first step to being happy with your body is to stop being your own worst enemy, which means countering these thoughts with far more realistic ideas.",
        "For example:\n\u201dI\u2019m not lazy, and I\u2019m certainly not useless.",
        "I\u2019m already finding ways to work on my body image, being proactive where most people are not.\u201d\n\u201dSaying \u2018no one will ever find me attractive,\u2019 is selfish and untrue \u2013 I can\u2019t control others, but I can control myself, and that is one very, very attractive quality.\u201d\n\u201dI am my body, and I don't hate myself.",
        "I may be unhappy right now, but I've done great, fun things, and that will only continue.",

        "Adam Dorsay, PsyD\t\t\tLicensed Psychologist & TEDx Speaker\t\t\t\tDevelop the vocabulary to describe how you feel about your body.",
        "The ability to name things is a source of wisdom.",
        "It puts you in the driver's seat when you were previously only a passenger.",
        "You can take a look and ask how you want to deal with your feelings now that you've named them rather than being only a silent presence in your life.",
        "Don't compare yourself with others.",
        "Don't let the media and photos from the internet put you down.",
        "Facebook and the media are notorious for creating an unrealistic standard of beauty that does not exist -- it is simply the culture of only sharing what is beautiful, even if that means Photoshopping real people to look more attractive than they really are.",
        "Try cutting your social media diet down if you're having trouble with this step.",
        "Comparing yourself with others is a fool's errand, because you can never really be or understand them and their own faults.",

        "You're not alone, and that should be comforting.",
        "If even the people you call \"attractive\" get unhappy about their body every now and then, then you can't put too much stock in your own self-criticism.",
        "Think past the scale.",
        "Your weight is only one small, small measure of your body -- and it is not a very good one, at that.",
        "The number of pounds you weigh not only fluctuates 3-5 pounds throughout the day and month, making an accurate reading difficult, but weight is necessarily tied to muscles, height, and body type.",
        "As such, it is not a great single indicator of your health or body image -- but people still get obsessed over that little number.",
        "Focus more on body health, not the image on a scale, to both look at feel healthier.",
        "Be grateful for what you have, both physical and mental.",
        "Gratitude and thanks will make you appreciate what you have, even if you don't feel happy about it at the moment.",
        "Remember that you have a wonderful, working body, internet access, and the desire to make yourself better -- none of which should be taken for granted.",
        "If you can't get yourself to be happy with your body just yet, try to be appreciative of your opportunities first.",
        "The happiness will soon follow."
