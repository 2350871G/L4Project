        "If you don\u2019t have much work experience, you can beef up your resume with educational awards or volunteer experience.",
        "Update your online resume (like a LinkedIn account) if you have one.",
        "Creating a Portfolio Website Make a website from a template using a website creation service.",
        "Many companies exist that allow you to make a website, like Wix or Weebly.",
        "They may charge you for upgrades or fancier services, but you can make a simple portfolio website on their platform for free.",
        "Squarespace is another option, though you do have to pay a monthly or annual fee.",
        "It\u2019s best to choose a template with a simple design and minimal animation, rather than crowded pages and flashy text.",
        "Create a main page with samples of your work.",
        "This should be the first page that viewers see when they visit your website.",
        "Experiment with different ways to lay out your samples until you find the form that is the most attractive.",
        "Lay out your samples in a grid, as a slideshow, or in one long, scroll-through page.",
        "Include brief captions or descriptions of your samples.",
        "You can also include a brief tagline of who you are on the main page, but leave the bulk of the personal information for a separate About Me page.",
        "Upload small file sizes so that the webpage doesn\u2019t take forever to load.",
        "Add an About Me page.",
        "This page should include a professional-looking headshot and your personal statement.",
        "You can write either in first or third person.",
        "This is a good spot to post or link to your resume and any relevant social media, such as a YouTube channel or an Instagram account (not your personal one).",
        "If you\u2019re struggling with what to say on this page, keep it simple.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve been working in graphic design for 2 years.",
        "I\u2019m based in Columbus and I specialize in marketing and advertising graphic design.",
        "I\u2019m open to new clients, commissions, and collaborations.\u201d\nCheck out the About Me pages of other people in your field for inspiration.",
        "You can also include relevant awards or certificates on this page.",
        "Include a Contact page so people can reach you.",
        "You can include a form where people can send you emails or post your email address.",
        "If you don\u2019t already have a professional email address, now\u2019s a good time to make one.",
        "It\u2019s best not to put your phone number online, because you will likely get a ton of spam calls.",
        "Instead, you can provide your phone number to someone once they\u2019ve already been in email contact with you, so you know they are legitimate.",
        "Be aware that you\u2019ll likely get a lot of spam emails after you post your email address online.",
        "Play around with the settings to find the best design.",
        "Most website creation services let you edit the fonts, colors, and layout of your website.",
        "Choose a simple, legible font, because the eye-catching thing should be your work, not the titles.",
        "Pick a color scheme and theme for your website that best reflects your professional goals.",
        "For example, if you want to become a children\u2019s book illustrator, your website might look good with pastel colors, but if you\u2019re trying to get hired as a financial copywriter, a dark color scheme would be better.",
        "Get feedback on your website before you launch it.",
        "You can ask a friend, family member, professor, or other people in your field to look over your website before you launch it.",
        "They can help you refine your website as well as catch glaring mistakes that you may have missed when you were too caught up in the little details.",
        "If the person just tells you it\u2019s a good website, you can ask for more feedback, and make sure they know your feelings won\u2019t be hurt.",
        "Ask for specific questions, like \u201cIs there any part of the text that could be improved?",
        "What do you think of the layout of the samples?",
        "Does the About Me page present an accurate impression of who I am?\u201d Making a Printed Portfolio Print your pages on quality paper.",
        "Use high-quality paper and a color printer.",
        "As a rough guideline, glossy paper will be better for visual art portfolios, while business, teaching, or writing portfolios will look better on matte paper.",
        "However, some artists prefer to display their work on matte paper, so it\u2019s up to you.",
        "Make sure all your pages are printed in the same direction, either horizontal or vertical.",
        "You want your viewer to be able to easily page through your portfolio without having to rotate it around.",
        "Put a table of contents at the beginning (optional).",
        "Including a table of contents makes it easier for prospective employers, administrators, or clients to navigate through your work and immediately access the information they need.",
        "If you plan on mailing out your portfolio, rather than flipping through it yourself to show someone, a table of contents is a good idea.",
        "Create your table of contents after you finish your portfolio but put it at the front.",
        "You do not need to list page numbers if you do not include them in your portfolio, but if you do decide to number the pages in your portfolio, list those numbers in your table of contents.",
        "Put your resume and personal statement first.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to put a couple of copies of your resume in your printed portfolio, so you can hand them out to potential employers and don\u2019t run out.",
        "Then, move on to your personal statement, to give people a good idea of your professional goals and expertise.",
        "Putting your personal statement before your work samples helps contextualize work.",
        "Including a head shot next to your personal statement can make your portfolio look more professional.",
        "However, if you are a model and your portfolio is already full of shots of yourself, this step is less necessary.",
        "Also, if you will be presenting your portfolio in person, a headshot is redundant.",
        "Put your best samples first.",
        "Start with the pieces you are most proud of, so that the moment you flip open your portfolio to show a potential employer, they will be wowed by your best sample.",
        "Play around with the order until you find the one you like best.",
        "You may be tempted to save your best work for last, but in fact you might lose clients before they even make it to the end of your portfolio.",
        "Try to start with a strong first impression.",
        "Include relevant awards and references at the end of your portfolio.",
        "The point of a portfolio is really to highlight your work, which is why you should start with your samples.",
        "However, it can also be a good opportunity to show off any relevant awards and certificates.",
        "End with your three to five references.",
        "You may want to separate out the different parts of your portfolio with tabs.",
        "Put all your pages in a screw post binder with plastic sleeves.",
        "Depending on what screw post binder you buy, you may have to buy a pack of plastic sleeves separately.",
        "The benefit of a screw post binding is that the pages hinge open flat, for a professional display.",
        "The plastic sleeves will waterproof your pages, and look much more professional than loose, hole-punched pages.",
        "Having plastic sleeves also means you can slip images in and out to change and update your portfolio if you have new work samples you want to include.",
        "Get feedback on your portfolio from a trusted friend or advisor.",
        "Ask someone familiar with your field to look through your portfolio.",
        "They can point out any mistakes you may have missed, and tell you if they think you chose the best order to display your samples.",
        "Be honest with people about what level of feedback you would like.",
        "If you just want encouragement, that\u2019s fine, but if you want constructive criticism, let them know."
