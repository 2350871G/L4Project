It requires purchasing supplies you probably don't have on hand, but the upside is that once you buy them, you'll have what you need to put feathers in all your friends' hair, too. Check out a craft store and a hair supply store (or look online) to buy the following:\nLong feathers. The trendiest feathers are long and thin, and usually have brown or black stripes. \"Grizzly feathers\" look realistic and fall gracefully against the hair for a look that blends in enough to look beautifully eclectic and not messy. They come in grown, hot pink, cerulean, neon yellow, and any other color you can imagine. Hair extension shields. These are small plastic discs that you insert over the piece of hair to which you're applying the extension. They protect the rest of your hair shaft from the glue and heat you're applying to the bit of hair that's getting a glue application. A keratin hair extension iron and keratin shrink links. A keratin shrink link is a small piece of hardened glue shaped like a cylinder that slips onto your hair. When you apply the hair extension iron to the shrink link, it melts the link into your hair, gluing the feather in place. A micro-ring loader. This is a small wire device that makes it easy to thread a shrink link onto your hair. It's like a giant needle threader. Keratin remover. This is a product you apply to the glued area when your'e ready to take out the feather. You could also just wait until it falls out in two or so months."

For example, you could pick one hot pink and one hot green feather for a super summery look. Or go with one feather in a striking color like electric blue or yellow to peek out from among your locks.

        "This is a popular style for younger girls.",
        "For a subtler, more mature look, pick a lock toward the bottom and back or side of your head.",
        "This way it will peek out when you move or turn your head, but you can pull it back if you need to for more formal settings.",
        "Slip a bead onto the crochet hook.",
        "It should fit easily over the hook.",
        "You just need one bead for each feather extension.",
        "Wrap your lock of hair around the hook.",
        "Take your lock of hair and wrap it around the crochet hook toward the hook part at the very tip.",
        "Just wrap it around one time.",
        "Pull your hair through the bead.",
        "Slide the bead up over your hair and pull your hair through the bead using the hook.",
        "If the whole lock doesn't fit, just pull through as much hair as you can.",
        "Make sure there's enough hair in the bead to hold the weight of the feathers with ease, since over time heavy feathers can pull out the hair.",
        "Situate the bead about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from your scalp, so it doesn't hurt while you sleep at night.",
        "Slip a feather into the bead.",
        "The feather should lay flat against your scalp and point toward your tips.",
        "This method is best for using just one feather at a time.",
        "If you have two small feathers that fit, you could try attaching them both at once.",
        "Clamp the bead to your hair.",
        "Use your needle nose pliers to grasp the bead and clamp the feather tight against your hair.",
        "Use your strength to make sure it's tightly in place.",
        "Let your hair fall into place and style it as normal.",
        "Take the feather out when you're ready.",
        "To remove the feather, just use your pliers to crimp the bead in the opposite direction, so that it opens back up and slips easily out of your hair.",
        "Do not attempt to pull the feather and bead out, since you could pull out your hair and cause damage."
