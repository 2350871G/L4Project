Transfer the mixture to a bowl and fold in the water chestnuts. Once the filling mixture is smooth, use a spatula to transfer it to a medium bowl. Add a 4-ounce (115 g) can of water chestnuts that have been minced to the bowl, and gently fold them in. Make a small patty with the filling to test the seasoning. When the water chestnuts are incorporated, use clean hands to form a small patty with the filling. You should use approximately 2 tablespoons (17 g) to make the patty. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of canola oil in pan and add the patty. Place a small saute pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes, and then place the patty made of the filling in the oil. Cook the patty until it\u2019s browned and drain on paper towel.

Steaming the Shumai Line a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves. To cook the shumai, you need a bamboo steamer. Lay several leaves of napa cabbage in the bottom of the steamer to line it. You can substitute lettuce for the cabbage if you prefer. Two to three leaves is usually enough to line the steamer. If you don't have a bamboo steamer, you can substitute a metal steamer basket. In addition to lining it with the cabbage leaves, though, it's a good idea to mist it with baking spray first to ensure that none of the dumplings stick if there are any gaps in the leaves. Bring some water to a boil in a large pan. Add 1- to 2-inches (2.5- to 5-cm) of water to a large, wide pan. Place it on the stove over high heat, and allow the water to come to a boil, which should take about 3 to 5 minutes. Place the steamer over the pan and add the shumai. When the water has come to a boil, set the steamer over the pan. Use tongs to place the dumplings into the steamer, and cover the steamer with its lid. Make sure the water doesn\u2019t touch the bottom of the steamer. However, you may need to add more water to the pan as it evaporates during the steaming process. Depending on how large the steamer is, you may need to cook the shumai in batches. Steam the dumplings until they\u2019re cooked through. Once the shumai is in the steamer, reduce the heat to medium. Allow the dumplings to cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until they are cooked through. Serving the Shumai Mix the chile paste and light soy sauce together. While the shumai is steaming, add 5 tablespoons (75 ml) of Asian chile paste and 10 tablespoons (150 ml) of light soy sauce to a small bowl. Stir together well so they are completely blended. You can substitute your favorite Asian dipping sauce if you prefer. Even plain soy sauce can work well. Use tongs to remove the shumai from the steamer.

Set the dumplings out to serve while they\u2019re still warm. Store any leftover shumai in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for 3 to 4 days.",
