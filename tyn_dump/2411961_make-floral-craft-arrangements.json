You don't have to draw a perfect representation of what you want, but sketching it out will help you figure out what type of look you're going for. Are you looking for a natural, hand-picked effect? You'll want a variety of colors, shapes and textures. For a more formal arrangement, you could stick with one type of flower in classic shape. If you're decorating for a holiday, you may also want to add seasonal items such as cornucopias around Thanksgiving or snowmen cut outs that can be placed in a vase. Decide whether you will have a vertical or horizontal arrangement when you conceptualize your floral design. A vertical design often features a taller vase with flowers extending higher in the center and lower around the edges. A vertical design has a shallower vase and looks to place flowers slightly higher in the center and drape them out toward the ends."
