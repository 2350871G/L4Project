    "text": " Making the Base Get a battery-operated tealight. You can find them in arts and crafts stores as well as in the candle section of a supermarket. A white tealight would work best, but you can also get a white glitter one for a fancier snowman. Turn the candle so that the flame is pointing away from you. Set the candle down on the table first, then rotate it until the tip of the flame is pointing away from you. Most battery-operated tealights have a flame that curves slightly to one side, rather than pointing straight up. Having the flame tilted upward will make the snowman look more jolly. Draw a simple snowman face using a black permanent marker. Make two dots above the flame for the eyes. Make four to five dots below the flame to make the mouth.

Cut an 11-inch (27.94-centimeter) long piece of thin ribbon and tie the ends together to form a loop. You can use any color you want, but red, white, or green are most commonly associated with winter and Christmas. Choose the thinnest ribbon you can find, about 1/16 to 1/8-inch (0.16 to 0.32-centimeter). Hot glue the ribbon to the back of the tealight. Place a drop of hot glue on the back of the tealight, close to the top. Press the knotted part of the ribbon into the glue, and let it set. Adding the Accessories Cut a 2\u00bd-inch (6.35-centimeter) long piece of pipe cleaner. You can use any color you want, but red or green would work best. Hot glue the pipe cleaner to the top of the tealight. Draw a line of hot glue around the top edge of the tealight, right above the eyes. Quickly press the pipe cleaner into the glue. If you need to, gently curve the pipe cleaner first, so that you don't risk accidentally touching the glue. Hot glue two mini pompoms to either end of the pipe cleaner. Choose two pompoms in a contrasting color. Place a drop of hot glue at either end of the pipe cleaner. Quickly press the pompoms into the glue.
