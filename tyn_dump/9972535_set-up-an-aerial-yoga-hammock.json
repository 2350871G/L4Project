Make another knot on the other end of the hammock fabric. Create another knot and attach another carabiner to the other end of your hammock fabric. When you\u2019re done, you should have a knot tied and a carabiner attached to both ends of the fabric. Installing a Ceiling Mount or Hooks Find a solid piece of wood to attach your mount or hook to. It\u2019s important that your mount or hooks are drilled directly into ceiling joists or solid wood or they will not be able to support your weight. Locate a portion of your ceiling that is at least 8 feet (2.4 m) off the ground and made of solid, sturdy wood. If you have drywall or drop ceilings, you may have to hang your hammock from a secured beam or rod, rather than hanging it from your ceiling. A contractor will be able to tell you if your ceiling can handle the load if you\u2019re unsure. Hold the mount or hook against the ceiling and mark the bolt holes. Use a step ladder and hold the ceiling mount or hooks for your hammock against the ceiling in the location where you want to hang it. Use a pencil to mark where the holes go. Measure and mark the ceiling for the other mount or hook. The other side of the ceiling hook or mount should be about 16 inches (41 cm) away from the original marks that you created. Repeat the process of holding the mount against the ceiling and marking where the holes need to go. The second set of holes should run parallel to the first holes. Drill holes where you marked. Get a drill bit that\u2019s the same size as the bolts that came with your hammock mount. Press the bit against the marks that you made and pull the trigger of your electric drill while applying upward pressure. This will create holes for your mount bolts. Wear a face mask and eye protection as you drill so that debris doesn\u2019t fall into your eyes or mouth. You can find the bolt size for your hammock in the instruction manual or product description. Screw the mount or hooks into the ceiling. If you are using a mount, hold the mount against the ceiling and push the threaded end of the bolts through the mount and into the holes that you created. If you are using hooks, simply press the threaded end of the hook into the hole you created. Turn the bolts or hooks clockwise until they are completely screwed into the ceiling. Use a wrench to finish tightening bolts, if you are using them. Pull down on the hooks to make sure they are secure once you're done. Hanging the Hammock Hang ropes over a secured beam or pole if you didn\u2019t install hooks. The ropes that come with your aerial yoga hammock should have loops in them. Hook a carabiner on the loop at one end of the rope. Then, simply drape the rope over a beam or pole so that both ends hang an equal amount on both sides. The ropes should be hung approximately 16 inches (41 cm) apart from each other. Push your ropes through the hooks if you have them. If you\u2019re using hooks or a ceiling mount, attach a carabiner to the end of the ropes. Then, thread the free end of the rope through the carabiner in your ceiling hooks. Both ends of the rope should hang down an equal length. Thread the end of the rope through the loop in the ropes. Take the end of the rope that has the carabiner attached, and thread it through one of the loops in the rope. Pull down on the carabiner to create a knot that attaches the rope to the hook, mount, or beam that you plan on hanging it on. Then, go over to the other rope attached to the ceiling and do the same thing. This slipknot will prevent the ropes from coming undone when you pull down on them. Attach the carabiners from your hammock to the carabiners on the rope. Attach both ends of the hammock to both carabiners hanging from the ceiling. Your yoga hammock should now be suspended in the air. Sit on the hammock to make sure it\u2019s secured. The hammock should be able to hold up your weight. If you feel insecure or the hooks come out, try attaching your hammock to a secure beam in your house instead. Don\u2019t start using the hammock until you know it\u2019s secured or you could injure yourself.",
