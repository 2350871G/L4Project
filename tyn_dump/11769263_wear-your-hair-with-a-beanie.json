One of the downfalls of wearing a beanie with longer hair is the resulting tangles you may experience. To combat this, make sure your hair is dry and tangle-free before you put on your beanie.

Simply grab a 1 inch (2.5 cm) piece of hair and do a quick 3-strand braid, tying off the ends with a small elastic."

Leaving your bangs down along with straight or wavy locks will frame your face even more and make your hair look fuller.
