These typically have a C-shaped construction, allowing you to hook them into your gutters from ground level. Just slip the attachment onto the nozzle of your vacuum and get cleaning. You can purchase a basic gutter-cleaning attachment for around $30. You may also be able to find these accessories at your local hardware store or home improvement center. If you don't already own a wet/dry vacuum, you can get one of these from your local home improvement center, as well. They typically cost about $100 brand new, and around $20 per day to rent.

First, fit your wet/dry vacuum or leaf blower with 1 or 2 extension wands to lengthen your reach. Then, tape 2 duct elbows together end-to-end before taping the contraption to the nozzle of the vacuum. It\u2019s as easy as that! To ensure that your makeshift gutter attachment holds together, use a strong type of tape, like duct or Gorilla tape. Aluminum duct elbows cost about $5 apiece at most hardware stores, which means you can save roughly $20 by cobbling together your own attachment if you already have a suitable roll of tape.Tip: Be sure to shop around for duct elbows that will fit over the nozzle of your vacuum without too much extra space around the edges. A pair of elbows with a diameter of 3 in (7.6 cm) should fit comfortably over a standard 2.5 in (6.4 cm) vacuum nozzle."

        "Scrape dry debris out your gutters a little at a time with a gutter rake.",
        "Hold the rake so that the angled head is facing away from you and raise it up to your gutter.",
        "Once it\u2019s inside, pull the pole towards you to drag clusters of leaves, sticks, and other debris over the edges.",
        "Continue in this fashion until you\u2019ve freed as much debris as possible.",
        "Strap on a facemask and wear sunglasses or similar eye protection to prevent small pieces of loose debris from falling into your eyes, nose, and mouth as you work.",
        "While it\u2019s possibly the cheapest solution overall, raking out your gutters can be difficult, time-consuming work.",
        "Be prepared to take short breaks as often as needed when your arms start to tire.",
        "Use gutter tongs to scoop out wet, decomposing debris.",
        "Elevate the tongs so that they\u2019re positioned just above the gutter with the arms open.",
        "Pull the string at the base of the attachment to clamp the tongs shut around a mound of debris, then lift it out of the gutter and slacken the string to release it.",
        "Proceed in short sections until you've cleared out the entire length of the gutter, breaking whenever necessary.",
        "It's also a good idea to wear a facemask and eye protection when working with gutter tongs, as you're likely to be sprinkled with drifting debris.",
        "If you plan on picking up the debris you clear out of your gutters, try to concentrate as much as you can in the same general area.",
        "This will make it much easier to deal with later.",
        "Place the gunk you remove in a garbage bag or wheelbarrow for easy disposal.",
        "When you\u2019re done cleaning, rake or shovel the fallen debris into the bag, then seal it up tight and chuck it in the trash.",
        "Alternatively, you could transfer the materials to a wheelbarrow and dump them in the woods or an out-of-the-way part of your yard or garden to let them break down naturally.",
        "The decomposing leaves, sticks, and other organic matter in your gutters can make excellent compost."
