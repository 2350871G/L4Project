        "Test cleaning products on an out of view part of the marble.",
        "Even if the label says a cleaning product is suited for marble, it's always a good idea to test the cleaner first.",
        "Choose an out of sight location on the marble, like under a stationary appliance, and use a small amount of cleaner on the marble.",
        "If the finish or color is affected by the cleaner after it dries, refrain from using the cleaner.",
        "Soak stubborn stains in bleach.",
        "Although bleach is a generally accepted cleaning agent for marble, it's relatively harsh.",
        "Only use bleach sparingly to clean your marble.",
        "Same as when using vinegar or hydrogen peroxide, dampen a clean, soft rag with bleach, wring out excess, and drape the rag over stains.",
        "Only use this technique for marble that is light in color.",
        "Bleach may cause discoloration in dark colored pieces.",
        "Identify engrained stains in your marble.",
        "If you've cleaned a spot time and again with various cleaners, it's likely the stain you are attempting to clean is engrained in the marble.",
        "To remove spots like this, the marble will have to be buffed and refinished.",
        "For the best results, this should only be attempted by a professional."
