Carefully remove the seeds from around the cores of the apples, being sure to pick out every seed before disposing of the cores. Be aware that most apple trees grown by farmers and gardeners come from grafted trees, and are not planted directly from the seed. Planting trees from apple seeds produced highly variable fruit, since apple trees are not guaranteed to grow according to their type or variety. The more seeds you plant, the more likely it will be that one of the trees will produce edible apples, as opposed to less edible varieties like crab apples. There is about a one in ten success rates of seeds growing into apple trees that produce fruit good enough to eat. Try to start the process of preparing the seeds during the fall, so that by the beginning of spring, the seeds are ready for planting."
