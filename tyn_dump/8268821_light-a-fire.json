        "Using Friction to Start a Fire Make a circular divot in a piece of fireboard.",
        "Get out a piece of softwood that you're using as a fireboard.",
        "The fireboard should be around \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick.",
        "In order to position a spindle into the fireboard, you need to make a small dip in the wood.",
        "Use a knife or sharp rock to carve a small circle that's the same diameter as the spindle you'll be using.Types of Wood for Fireboards:CedarBalsam firElmWillowCottonwood\n\nThe divot only needs to be about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) deep.",
        "Place the spindle into the divot of the fireboard.",
        "Step on 1 end of the fireboard to keep it in place and crouch down onto your other knee so you're leaning over the fireboard.",
        "Put 1 end of the stick that you're using as a spindle into the divot you carved and hold the other end with your hand.",
        "The spindle is a piece of dried hardwood that's the width of your pinky or smaller.",
        "Rub the spindle between your hands as you apply pressure.",
        "Position the end of the spindle between your palms.",
        "Then rub your hands so the spindle spins quickly.",
        "Use your entire hands to create friction instead of just rubbing the spindle between your palms.",
        "Apply force as you do this to make a small dark pilot hole.",
        "Your hands will work down the spindle.",
        "When they're about halfway down the spindle, return your hands to the top of the spindle and start rubbing again.",
        "Cut a triangular notch into the middle of the pilot hole.",
        "Use a sharp knife to carefully cut a clean triangular opening into the center of the hole you just made with the spindle.",
        "You'll need to cut completely through the \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) fireboard.",
        "Making a clean notch will allow the powder to fall down as you start your fire.",
        "Put a scrap of wood under the fireboard and rub the spindle again.",
        "Once you've made the notch, put a thin piece of wood under the board.",
        "This will catch the dust and coal.",
        "Then rub the spindle through your palms until the fireboard smokes on its own.",
        "Remember to apply pressure to the spindle as you rub it.",
        "Transfer the coal and dust to tinder and blow it to make a fire.",
        "The fireboard should continue to smoke once you set the spindle aside.",
        "Slowly remove the fireboard so any dust falls down onto the scrap of wood.",
        "Then put the dust and the coal onto the tinder of the fire you built.",
        "Blow gently to light the tinder.",
        "Have your kindling and fuelwood close by so you can build the fire easily."
