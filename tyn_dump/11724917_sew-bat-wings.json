Stack the 2 pieces on top of each other and lay a long-sleeved black shirt on 1 side of the fabric so the shirt overlaps by about 12 inches (30 cm).

Place the chalk back at the armpit and continue the line along the bottom seam of the sleeve. Then, mark where the sleeve and bottom of the shirt end.

To make lots of points on the wings, make about 5 or 6 scallops. For larger scallops with fewer points, draw 3 scallops. If you need help making the scalloped shapes, lay a round plate on the fabric and trace around half of the plate to make a scallop. Use a small dessert plate if you're making small wings for a kid."
