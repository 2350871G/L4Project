Writing something like \"I will just die if I never see this show again\" is a bit dramatic and a good way to get your letter dismissed as the rantings of a deranged viewer. You also don't want to make threats, like \"If you don't put X back on the air, I'll never watch your network again!\" You want your letter to be read by a network executive, so be brief, be real. Write an anecdote about how the show has become part of your life. The execs are TV fans too. They'll understand, and you'll make your point."
