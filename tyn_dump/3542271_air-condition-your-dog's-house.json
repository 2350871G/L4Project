Temperatures are much cooler in the shade, so it\u2019s important to provide some shady spaces for your dog to use when it\u2019s hot outside. Some good ways to create shady spots in your yard are by planting plenty of trees and bushes, by creating some kind of deck or porch space for your dog to get under, or by giving your dog a doghouse."
