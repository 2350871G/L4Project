    "text": " Assembling the Humba Pata Bring water to a boil over high heat. Pour 6 cups (1,400 ml) of water into a large pot and turn the burner to high heat. The water should come to a vigorous boil. Put a lid on the pot to make the water boil faster. Boil 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of ham hocks (pata) for 40 to 60 minutes. Once the water boils, lower the sliced ham hocks into the pot. Turn the burner down to medium heat and cover the pot. If it looks like too much water is evaporating as the ham hocks boil, add more water to the pot. The ham hocks should become slightly tender, but it will finish cooking when you fry it. Transfer the ham hocks to a plate. Turn off the burner and use a large slotted spoon to scoop the boiled ham hocks out of the water. Set the ham hocks on a plate or bowl and set them aside. You can discard the water in the pot. Saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Pour 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of cooking oil into another pot and turn the burner to medium heat. Once the oil shimmers, stir in 1 chopped onion and 4 cloves of crushed garlic. Stir the onion and garlic frequently to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Add the ham hocks and cook them for 1 minute. Put the boiled ham hocks into the pot with the onion and garlic. Stir and cook the ham hocks over medium heat for 1 minute. The ham hocks should brown a little as they saut\u00e9. Simmering and Finishing the Humba Pata Add the soy sauce, pineapple juice, and pork bouillon cube. Pour 4 cups (950 ml) of pineapple juice and \u20442 cup (120 ml) of soy sauce into the pot. Stir in 1 pork bouillon cube when the liquids begin to boil. Keep stirring until the bouillon cube dissolves. Stir in the bay, pepper, banana blossoms, and salted black beans. Add 3 dried bay leaves, \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of crushed peppercorn, \u00bd cup (about 50 g) of dried banana blossoms, and \u00bc cup (15 g) of fermented, salted black beans. Stir to incorporate the seasonings into the liquid. Cover and simmer it for 20 minutes or until until the pork is cooked through. Put the lid on the pot and reduce the burner to medium heat. Let the liquid bubble gently so it reduces by half. The pork should reach 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) with a meat thermometer once it's finished cooking. Stir in the vinegar and brown sugar and cook it for 5 minutes. Add \u00bc cup (50 g) of dark brown sugar and 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vinegar to the pot.
