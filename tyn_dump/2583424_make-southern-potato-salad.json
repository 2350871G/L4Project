The pot should be large enough to fit all of the potatoes with a couple of inches of space at the top to spare. Once the water is boiling, add the potato pieces. Continue to boil until they are tender, which should take about seven to eight minutes. Keep checking on them regularly, because it's crucial that they do not get too soft. You want them to become tender, but not fall apart. You do not want to wind up with mashed potatoes."

Turn your stovetop to medium-high heat. Once the water starts to boil, remove the pot from the heat and let your eggs cook in the hot water for about eight to ten minutes. Once they are done cooking and have cooled, peel the shells off the eggs and dice them up. Learn the easiest ways to peel hardboiled eggs here!"

Put your potatoes in a large mixing bowl. Put the chopped eggs and potatoes into the refrigerator to chill. It's best to construct and season this salad after everything has cooled."

Keep your potato salad in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve it. This recipe makes about six servings.
