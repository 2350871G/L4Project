Use two rubber bands to loosely secure the pleats at either end of the scarf. If you prefer, you can twist or roll the scarf to create random pleats. The pleats help create a textured look when you apply the dye."

        "Find a baking dish that's large enough to hold a white silk scarf.",
        "Fill the container with cool water and 1 cup (237 ml) of white vinegar.",
        "Allow the scarf to soak for 8 hours or overnight.",
        "As the silk soaks, you'll notice that it becomes more translucent so it can take the color more easily.",
        "Preheat the oven.",
        "When you're ready to dye the scarf, you need the oven to be hot enough to help the silk absorb the color.",
        "Set the temperature to 175\u00b0F (79\u00b0C), and allow the oven to fully preheat.",
        "Pour out the water until the scarf is just covered and add more vinegar.",
        "After the scarf has soaked overnight, pour out the water from the baking dish.",
        "Leave just enough water so the silk is barely covered and pour 2 cups (474 ml) of white vinegar into the dish.",
        "If you accidentally spill out too much water, just add it back in so the scarf is mostly covered.",
        "Add food coloring to the water to get the desired color.",
        "When you've spilled out the excess water and added the vinegar, squeeze several drops of liquid food coloring into the dish in your desired color(s).",
        "Start with about 8 to 10 drops of food coloring, and add more until you achieve as bright or deep a color as you'd like.",
        "Be creative with the food coloring.",
        "You can add food coloring in one color to one half of the scarf and coloring another shade to the other half instead of settling for a solid color.",
        "Mix the coloring around with the scarf.",
        "Place rubber gloves on your hands to protect them from the coloring, and swirl the coloring around with the silk.",
        "Continue to mix the dye and vinegar mixture together with the silk to help it begin to soak into the scarf.",
        "The color won't begin to set until you heat the scarf so play around with the scarf and dye until you are happy with the pattern.",
        "Heat the scarf in the oven for at least 40 minutes.",
        "When the scarf and dye are mixed, place the baking dish in the preheated oven.",
        "Allow the scarf to heat in the bath for 40 minutes to 2 hours, or until the water mixture turns clear.",
        "Check on the scarf every 20 minutes while it's heating to see how clear the dye bath is.",
        "Let the scarf cool.",
        "When the dye bath turns clear, remove the baking dish from the oven.",
        "Allow the scarf to cool in the dish until it comes to room temperature, which can take up to an hour.",
        "Wash the scarf and hang it to dry.",
        "Once the scarf is cool enough to handle, rinse it in the sink with lukewarm water.",
        "Add a mild soap and wash the silk until the water runs clear.",
        "Hang the scarf to air dry.",
        "The scarf will be fairly wrinkled when it's finished drying.",
        "You can use an iron to smooth it so it's ready to wear.",
        "Staining a Silk Scarf with Tissue Paper Lay the scarf out on a lined work surface.",
        "To keep your countertop or table from stains, use a large plastic trash bag to cover the surface and secure it in place with masking tape.",
        "Fold a white silk scarf in half, and place it on the plastic.",
        "You can use plastic sheeting to cover your work surface if you prefer.",
        "Tear the tissue paper into pieces and place them on the silk.",
        "When the scarf is place on the work surface, begin tearing up pieces of bleeding tissue paper it two or more different colors.",
        "Place the tissue on the scarf in a random pattern until most of the scarf is covered.",
        "You can find bleeding tissue paper at art supply and craft stores.",
        "When you place the tissue paper on the scarf, leave some white gaps between the pieces.",
        "Spray the tissue paper with water.",
        "Once the tissue paper pieces are in place on the scarf, begin spraying the the paper with plain water.",
        "Make sure to cover all of tissue paper with water so it can begin to bleed onto the silk.",
        "Blot away the paper towel.",
        "Put on a pair of latex or rubber gloves to protect your hands from staining, and begin to blot the scarf and tissue paper with a piece of paper towel.",
        "Work until you blot away all of the excess water.",
        "Try not to disrupt the tissue paper too much when you blot the scarf.",
        "You'll likely need to replace the paper towel throughout the blotting process when it becomes too wet to absorb any more water.",
        "Remove the tissue paper and dry the scarf.",
        "After you've blotted the entire scarf, lift the tissue paper pieces from the scarf and discard them.",
        "Place the scarf in the dryer, and dry it on high for 20 minutes so the dye has time to set.",
        "Leave your gloves on when you remove the tissue paper pieces from the scarf so your fingers don't get stained.",
        "Iron your scarf.",
        "Once the scarf is dry, place it on an ironing board.",
        "Use an iron on the silk setting to carefully iron the scarf so it is smooth and ready to wear."
