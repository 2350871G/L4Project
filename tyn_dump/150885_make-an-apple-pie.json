Get out a medium bowl and put 1 2/3 cups (225 g) of all-purpose flour into it along with 1 tablespoon (15 g) of sugar and 1 teaspoon (4 g) of kosher salt. Whisk the dry ingredients for about 30 seconds so they're combined. Avoid using whole-wheat or bread flour for the dough since these will make the pastry too dense and tough. Cut the butter into 1/2 in (1.3 cm) cubes and mix it into bowl. Cut 1 cup (225 g) of cold unsalted butter into cubes and put them in the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use your fingers to toss the butter and smash each cube until it's flat. You don't need to cut or rub the butter into the dry ingredients since it will incorporate when you roll and fold the dough. Stir in \u20442 cup (120 ml) of cold water to make a shaggy dough. Pour the cold water into the bowl and use your hands to mix the dough until it comes away from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be rough and shaggy instead of a smooth ball. The dough should be cool or it will become sticky and difficult to handle. If you need to cool the dough, wrap in plastic wrap and chill it for a few minutes before you roll and fold it. Roll the dough into a 10 x 15 in (25 x 38 cm) rectangle. Sprinkle a large work surface with flour and scoop the dough onto it. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large, roughly shaped rectangle. It's important to have a well-floured surface or the dough will stick and make it difficult to handle. Fold the rectangle twice to make a small, thick rectangle. Bring the narrow ends of the rectangle towards the center like you're closing a book. Then fold them in half again so you're left with a thick block of folded dough. Folding the dough will create flaky layers within the pastry. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Use a sharp knife or bench scraper to cut the dough into 2 portions. You'll roll out 1 portion for the bottom crust and 1 portion for the top crust. Since you'll be rolling the dough into a circle, it doesn't matter what shape you cut the dough. Mixing the Apple Filling Shake the brown sugar, salt, and spices in a sealable plastic bag. Get out a 1 gallon (3.8 l) plastic bag and put 1 cup (225 g) of packed brown sugar into it. Add 2 1/2 teaspoons (6.5 g) of ground cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of grated nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground cloves.

The tapioca starch will thicken the filling as the pie cooks. If you don't have tapioca starch, substitute cornstarch (also called corn flour) or instant clearjel. Assembling the Pie Roll half of the dough into a 14 in (35.5 cm) circle and lay it in a pie dish. Sprinkle your work surface with a little flour and place half of the dough on it. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large, thin circle that's 14 in (35.5 cm) in diameter. Turn the dough frequently as you roll to prevent it from sticking to your work surface. You may need to sprinkle more flour if the dough becomes sticky. Lay the pastry in a 9 in (22 cm) pie plate and trim the edges of the dough. Press the dough down so it fits into the corners and sides of the pan. The dough will extend up and over the sides of the pie plate. Take a sharp paring knife and cut the edge of the dough so it hangs over by 1 in (2.5 cm). Discard the scraps or roll them thinly (about 1/4 in or 6 mm) thick and dust them with cinnamon and sugar.

Sprinkle your work surface with a little more flour and roll out the remaining half of dough into another large circle. Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and lay the pastry circle on it. Avoid trimming the circle for the top of the pie before you assemble the pie. Cover and chill the pastry for 2 hours.
