                    "description": "Several companies offer ready-made jellyfish and jellyfish tanks. The benefit of buying a premade jellyfish tank is that all the parts and pieces you need will be easily assembled, saving you the stress of figuring out what kind of filter, pump, and tank you need for your jellyfish. After you get the tank assembled, the manufacturer will send you jellyfish in the mail. Your tank should be a Kreisel or pseudokreisel design. A standard boxy fish tank will not do. This is because jellyfish need slowly circulating water. A kreisel or pseudokreisel design accomplishes this by creating a current that runs in a circle around the top, bottom, and sides of the tank. You should have at least two gallons of water per jellyfish. In other words, if you have three jellyfish, your tank should be no smaller than six gallons. Consult a pet shop proprietor or marine life expert if you are unsure of what kind of tank you need."

                    "description": "Jellyfish should be in water that is approximately room temperature, between 70-72 degrees Fahrenheit. Slightly higher temperatures (up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit) may improve the growth rate of your jellyfish. Water temperatures can dip to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit without adversely affecting your jellyfish. Some species of moon jellyfish can tolerate temperatures up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Always consult your vet or a marine expert to ensure you keep your particular jellyfish species at an appropriate temperature. Put a waterproof thermometer in your jellyfish tank. Monitor the temperature regularly. If your tank is too cold, you could place a heat lamp near the outside of the tank to raise the temperature, or try simply raising the temperature of your home thermostat. If your jellyfish habitat is too hot, consider moving the tank to a cooler location like a basement, or invest in an aquarium cooler."

Use a hydrometer to measure the water\u2019s salinity, and ensure that when you change the water, it is at an appropriate salinity level. Hydrometers are readily available at pet stores and online. Introduce your jellyfish to a tank with a salinity level that is slightly higher than normal. This way, they have a better chance at floating. You can gradually reduce the salinity over time. Water with a salinity level that is too low will make them sink. If you need to adjust the salinity, remove your jellyfish from the tank and place them in a smaller quarantine tank. Dump the main tank out and mix a new batch of water at the correct salinity. Connect your pump to ensure the water mixes well for about 24 hours. Check the water in your hydrometer. Repeat as needed. Do not use tap water to create saltwater for your tank. Buy deionized or reverse osmosis water from your grocery store, and add Jelly Salt (a salt specifically designed for jellyfish habitats) in an appropriate amount."

One half to one full scoop of commercial jellyfish food is usually enough. Check manufacturer directions for specific use directions.
