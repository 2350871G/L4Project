A swollen hose that is cracked and hard is often caused by heat damage. These hoses can be too close to heat sources under the hood or it may be the result of overheating. Bulging hoses can also be caused by electrochemical degradation when there's a coolant leak dripping onto hoses. Sometimes you can feel tiny cracks or weak spots when you squeeze a cool hose near one of the ends."
