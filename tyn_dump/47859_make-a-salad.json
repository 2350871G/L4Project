Always rinse off lettuce before you use it. Use a salad spinner to rinse and dry your lettuce, or simply run the leaves under water and gently pat them dry with a clean paper towel. You can buy pre-cut lettuce from the store, or you can buy whole bunches of lettuce. If you buy a bunch, rinse off the leaves and either tear them into bite-sized pieces by hand, or use a clean knife and cutting board to chop them up."

Kale, arugula, and spinach are all great options that will create a hardy base for the rest of your salad ingredients. Arugula has a peppery flavor. Raw kale can be tough to chew. Use baby kale for a softer option, or cut away and discard the stems from kale leaves to make them easier to eat."
