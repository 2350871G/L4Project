        "The wax you\u2019ll be using will settle nicely into the woven fibers of fabric shoes.",
        "On materials like leather or synthetics, it will simply form a coat on the surface which is likely to wear off much faster.",
        "Canvas, hemp, suede, and other textured materials will make the best candidates for waterproofing.",
        "Purchase a quality waterproofing spray.",
        "There are many different brands and styles to choose from, but they all do essentially the same thing.",

        "Spray the entire upper portion of the shoe.",

        "Make sure you cover every part of the shoe where moisture might get in, including the seam where the upper connects to the outsole.",

        "Let the shoes dry overnight.",

        "Should you decide to apply multiple coats, give each coat a few minutes to wick up before following up with the next.",
        "Don't try to accelerate the dry time by using an external heat source, such as a hair dryer or an open fire.",

        "Reapply the spray after every few uses.",
        "As a rule, waterproofing sprays aren't as resilient as waxes, so you may find yourself having to touch up your footwear more often to keep your feet dry and happy.",

        "Reapply waterproofing products as often as needed.",
        "Make sure you give your footwear some much-needed attention before the rainy season arrives.",
        "Under normal conditions, you shouldn\u2019t need to repeat the process more than about once every few months.",

        "If you live in a hotter climate, you may need to show your shoes a little more attention.",

        "Wash out the waterproofing when desired.",
        "If at any point you decide to undo the waterproofing, all you need to do is scrub the shoes with a sudsy solution of hot water and mild dish soap or laundry detergent.",

        "Give the shoes time to dry and it will be like it never happened.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished washing, rinse the shoes until the water runs clear.",
        "Otherwise, leftover traces of waterproofing and detergent can congeal into a slick residue as they dry."
