Tug on the tail at the base of the slipknot to tighten it. Place the slipknot onto your crochet hook.Tip: You can select 1 or more individual colors for your poncho, or go with a variegated yarn! This type of yarn is dyed with multiple colors to give your project a multi-color look. Chain 130 for a small or medium size poncho. With the slipknot on your hook, loop the yarn over the hook 1 time and then pull this through the slipknot to create a new loop. This is your first chain. Repeat this 129 more times. To make a large/extra-large poncho, chain 150. To make a XXL/XXL poncho, chain 170. Slipstitch to secure the ends of the chain in a circle. Once you have chained 130 stitches (or the required amount for the desired size), place the first chain onto the hook next to the last loop you made. Bring the yarn over the end of the hook and pull it through both loops to secure the ends together. Make sure that the chain is not twisted when you connect the ends! To prevent this, place the end of the chain onto the end of your crochet hook before the chain gets too long. Chain 3 to begin the first round. Make a chain of 3 extending from the slipstitch. This is where you connected the 2 ends of the chain. This chain of 3 counts as your first double crochet stitch. Double crochet into each of the next 2 chains. Wrap the yarn around the hook 1 time and then insert the hook into the stitch next to the base of your chain of 3. Then, yarn over the end of the hook again. Pull this yarn through the first loop on the hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through 2. Yarn over 1 more time and pull through 2 again. Repeat this stitch for the next chain. Chain 1 and skip the next 2 stitches. Make a chain of 1 extending from the top of your last double crochet stitch. Then, skip over the next 2 chains in your row. This chain will provide slack to create a chain 1 space, which you will crochet into in the next round. Double crochet 1 time into each of the next 3 stitches. After skipping 2 stitches, work the next 3 stitches as normal double crochet stitches. This will create a cluster of 3 double crochet stitches. Repeat the sequence to complete the round, then slipstitch. Continue to chain 1, skip 2, and double crochet 1 time into the next 3 stitches all the way around the chain. Repeat this sequence until you are back at the beginning, then slipstitch into the top chain of the chain of 3 at the beginning of the round. This will connect the ends of the round. Working the Second Round Chain 3 to start the second round. Crochet a chain of 3 extending from the slipstitch you made to secure the first round. Start each additional round this way as well. Double crochet 2 times into the first chain 1 space. Double crochet as usual, but work both of the first 2 double crochet stitches into the same chain 1 space. Position them so that they are next to the chain of 3 you made. Chain 1 and double crochet 3 times into the next chain 1 space. After you finish the last 2 double crochet stitches, chain 1 again. Then, work 3 double crochet stitches into the same chain 1 space. Repeat this stitch sequence 4 more times for a size small/medium, 5 more times for a large/extra-large, or 6 more times for a XXL/XXXL.Tip: Use a stich counting app to help you keep track of your clusters. Tap the app each time you complete a cluster! Work an increase into the next chain 1 space. Chain 1 and double crochet 3 times into the next chain 1 space, then repeat this sequence again in the same space. This will create 2 clusters of 3 stitches in the same chain 1 space and increase the total number of stitches in the round by 3. These increases will form the pointed parts on the front and back of your poncho. Chain 1 and double crochet 3 times into a chain 1 space 12 times. Resume the previous stitch sequence of chaining 1 and double crocheting 3 times into a chain 1 space. Work this sequence a total of 12 times. If you are making a size large/extra-large, then work this sequence 14 times. For a XXL/XXXL, work the sequence 16 times. Increase in the next chain 1 space by working 2 blocks of 3 double crochets. Repeat the usual stitch sequence of chaining 1 and double crocheting 3 times into the chain 1 space, but then work the sequence into the same space a second time. This will leave you will 6 double crochet stitches in 1 chain 1 space. Chain 1 and double crochet 3 times to the end of the round. After working the second increase, resume the main stitch sequence to the end of the round. Crochet a chain of 1 and then work 3 double crochet stitches into a chain 1 space. You will need to do this a total of 6 times for a small/medium, 7 times for a large/extra-large, or 8 times for a XXL/XXXL. Chain 1 and slipstitch to connect the ends of the round. After you finish the last stitch, work a chain of 1 and then insert your crochet hook into the top of the chain of 3 you made at the beginning of the round. Yarn over and pull through both stitches. This completes round 2! Finishing the Poncho Repeat round 2 until the piece measures 20.5 in (52 cm). Crochet additional rounds the same way you did for round 2. Work your increases into the chain 1 space between the 2 clusters you made in the previous round. If you are making a size large/extra-large, work until the poncho is 21.25 in (54.0 cm). For a size XXL/XXXL, work until the poncho is 22 in (56 cm). Slipstitch to connect the ends of the last round. When you complete your last round, insert the hook through the first stitch in the round. Then, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull through both loops to secure the ends together. Tie a knot through the last stitch and cut the excess yarn. Cut the yarn about 6 in (15 cm) from the last stitch, then pull the end through the last stitch you made to secure it in a knot. Cut the excess yarn about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the last stitch. Your poncho is finished! Try it on!Want some crocheted items to match your new poncho?
