Explain the use of this participle. Instead of being used to show the action of the noun, it is used to describe, or modify, the noun. For instance, the word \u201csmiling\u201d is usually used to indicate an act, such as \u201cthe girl is smiling;\u201d however, it can be used to describe the noun by saying, \u201cthe smiling girl.\u201d\nThis is simply a participle and not yet a phrase.

Use a more complicated example to show how a participle can be used with other words to form a participial phrase. For example, \u201cThe girl, smiling at the boy, was blushing.\u201d Ask the students to identify the noun, the verb and the participle. Repeat this exercise with more examples using participial phrases. Explain that there are present participles, which describe something that is going on, and past participles that describe something in the past. Generally, they are used in a very similar fashion; however, they should know how to identify a past participial phrase and a present participial phrase using the verbs in the sentence. Introduce students to the use of verbs ending in \u201ced\u201d as participles. For example, Interested in the ancient Mayans, Beth reads a lot of books about Mexico. If the students have trouble recognizing the participle, ask them to identify what the phrase is describing, Beth or the books. Using Participial Phrases Ask the students why they would use participial phrases, instead of writing \u201cBeth reads a lot of books about Mexico because she is interested in the ancient Mayans.\u201d If they are struggling with the concept, explain how these phrases can be used to describe something in fewer words and to vary sentence structure.
