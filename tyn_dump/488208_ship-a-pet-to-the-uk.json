This microchip will ensure your pet is properly identified when he reaches the UK. Keep in mind microchips do not act as GPS devices or tracking devices for your pet. Instead, they contain a radio-frequency identification that acts as a permanent ID for your pet. The microchip procedure is painless for your pet and can be done at your vet\u2019s office. Not all microchips use the same reader. To ensure the chip can be read, you can purchase one that is compatible with the chip, or you can ask your vet what type of chip has been implanted and then contact the UK DEFRA organization to see if the readers are compatible. If the chip cannot be read, you pet will likely be put into quarantine."
