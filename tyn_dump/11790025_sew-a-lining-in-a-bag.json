To line a small clutch or purse, you might use a rayon or polyester blend fabric, since these are soft and shiny.

To do this, leave a gap in the center of the bottom edge of your liner. Feel free to make a larger gap if you have large hands.

Although you can use drop-in liners on many bags, they're especially great for rigid bags made of fabric that doesn't bend easily.

Sewing a Turned-Out Liner into a Bag Use a turned-out liner for a flexible bag. Since turned-out liners don't need to be as exact as drop-in liners, they're great for beginner sewers. The turned-out lining method works best for bags that don't have to hold their shape perfectly. This allows you to bend, scrunch, and adjust the bag and lining fabric. For example, use a turned-out liner for market bags, soft totes, or flexible purses. Turn the liner wrong side out and keep the bag right side out. You'll stuff the bag into the liner before you turn it out, so leave the bag right side out. Take the liner that you made for the bag and pull the material so it's inside out. Remember that the right side of the fabric has the pattern, while the wrong side doesn't have the pattern visible. Push the bag into the liner and pin the side seams in place. Slide the bag inside the turned-out liner and it into the corners. Line up the top edges of the bag with the liner and stick a sewing pin horizontally through each of the side seams.Tip: If you're sewing a large bag, insert sewing pins about every 3 inches (7.6 cm) around the top of the bag. If you sewed handles onto the bag, push them down between the side of the bag and the liner so they're out of the way. Use fabric clips if you don't want to stick pins into the bag. Sew across the top of the liner and bag using a straight stitch. Take your pinned project to the sewing machine and straight stitch along the top. Leave at least a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance as you go. When you finish sewing around the bag, make a few backstitches and cut the thread. Remove the sewing pins as you stitch around the bag so you don't accidentally sew over them. Reach into the gap at the bottom and pull the bag through it. Find the gap that you left at the bottom of the liner and put your hand through it. Keep hold of the liner with one hand and use your other hand to grab the bag. Then, pull the bag through the gap. Don't stuff the liner back down into the bag just yet. Straight stitch the gap in the lining closed and push the liner into the bag. Fold the gap in the liner so it lines up with the edge that you just sewed. Then, sew close to the edge as you stitch the gap closed. Push the liner down into the bag.
