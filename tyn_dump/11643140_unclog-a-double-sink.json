        "If the water doesn\u2019t drain, wait for it to cool down so you don\u2019t burn yourself trying other methods.",
        "Plunging the Sink Block the drain on the unclogged side of the sink.",
        "Use the drain plug that came with your sink if you have one, or stuff a towel into the drain.",
        "Make sure you create a tight seal on the unclogged side, or else your plunger won\u2019t work properly.",
        "Since a plunger can cause pressure to build up, ask a helper to hold the drain plug in place so it doesn\u2019t come loose.",
        "Fill the clogged side of the sink with 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) of water.",
        "Use the warmest water than you can handle when you fill the clogged side of your sink.",
        "Make sure there\u2019s at least 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm), or else the plunger won\u2019t seal around the drain properly.",
        "If you already have standing water in your sink, you can skip this step.",
        "Place a plunger around the clogged drain.",
        "Use a cup plunger if you have one since they\u2019re designed for sink drains.",
        "If you only have a toilet plunger, tuck the flange (the cylindrical part that sticks out of the cup) up into the cup so it's out of the way and you can get a tight seal around the drain.",
        "Whichever kind you use, press the rim of the cup around the drain and push down lightly so it forms a tight seal.",
        "Keep the plunger handle vertical or else you may cause the plunger to lose suction.",
        "You may be able to find a plunger with a short handle so it\u2019s easier to maneuver in your sink.",
        "Pump the plunger up and down for 30 seconds.",
        "Hold the plunger\u2019s handle so it stays vertical and push it straight down to create suction inside the drain.",
        "Pull the handle up quickly, but not so forcefully that you take the plunger out of the sink.",
        "Continue pushing the handle down repeatedly for at least 30 seconds to loosen the clog in your pipes.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about the plunger splashing you with water, wear gloves and an apron so you don\u2019t get dirty.Tip: If you don\u2019t have a helper, use your dominant hand to operate the plunger and your nondominant hand to hold the drain plug in place on the other side of the sink.",
        "That way, you don\u2019t lose suction.",
        "Remove the plunger to see if the sink drains.",
        "Carefully lift the plunger out of the water so you don\u2019t splash water out from the sink.",
        "Check if the water spirals or begins draining.",
        "If the water drains quickly, then you forced the clog out from the pipes.",
        "If it drains slowly or doesn\u2019t empty, try plunging the drain again for another 30 seconds before checking again.",
        "If the plunger didn\u2019t work after the second time, you may need to check the sink\u2019s trap or use a drain snake.",
        "Removing the Trap Place a bucket underneath the sink\u2019s drainage pipe.",
        "Look for the U-shaped section of pipe under your sink, which is known as the trap.",
        "Use a bucket that\u2019s large enough to hold all of the standing water in your sink and set it directly under the trap.",
        "Put cleaning rags around the outside of the bucket in case any water splashes out.",
        "You may also use a garbage bag or garbage can if you have room underneath your sink.Tip: If you don\u2019t have a large enough bucket to hold all of the water that\u2019s stuck in your sink, bail out the standing water and pour it down a different drain in your home.",
        "Then place the bucket underneath the pipes.",
        "Unscrew the nuts on each side of the trap.",
        "Locate the nuts or pipe connectors on both sides of the trap and try turning them counterclockwise by hand to see if they come loose.",
        "If they\u2019re too tight, grip them with a pair of pliers and continue loosening them until the trap comes off of the pipes.",
        "Let any water or debris drain into the bucket.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about getting splashed with dirty water, wear rubber gloves.",
        "Try pushing a wire hanger through the trap to remove the blockage.",
        "Unbend a wire hanger so you have a long straight piece.",
        "Push one end of the wire into the trap and force it in as far as you can push it.",
        "If you meet resistance, push and pull the wire to break apart the clog.",
        "Let the clog fall into the bucket so you can easily dispose of it.",
        "If you don\u2019t feel any resistance, then the clog may be deeper in the pipe and you\u2019ll need to use a snake to get rid of it.",
        "Rinse the trap clean in a different sink.",
        "Hold the trap underneath a faucet with hot water and let it go through the pipe.",
        "Make sure to rinse out each side of the pipe so you can clean out any debris that may be stuck on the inside.",
        "If water flows through the trap easily, then you\u2019ve removed the clog.",
        "If water still gets stuck in the trap, then try using the wire hanger to break apart the clog or scrape the sides of the pipe.",
        "You can also use your garden hose with a jet attachment to forcefully clean out the trap.",
        "Reattach the trap and try running water in the sink.",
        "Position the pipe back underneath your sink so it lines up with the pipes leading to and away from your sink.",
        "Screw the nuts tightly back into place by hand or with your pliers so they don\u2019t leak.",
        "Turn on your faucet with hot water and run it on each side of the sink for about 5 minutes.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t back up, then you have cleaned out the clog.",
        "If the sink still clogs on either side, then the blockage may be further down the pipe.",
        "Snaking the Drain Pipe Set a bucket under the sink\u2019s trap.",
        "Make sure you use a bucket large enough to hold all of the standing water in your sink.",
        "Locate the U-shaped trap connected to the sink\u2019s drains and place the bucket underneath it so the pipes can drain directly into it.",
        "Put a bucket underneath your sink even if you don\u2019t have standing water since there may still be some liquid that comes out from the pipes.",
        "You can also use a garbage bag or garbage can.",
        "Loosen the nuts on the trap with a wrench to remove it.",
        "Locate the nuts or fasteners on each side of the trap and try turning them counterclockwise by hand.",
        "If they\u2019re too tight to remove on your own, use a pair of pliers to loosen them.",
        "Unscrew the nuts or fasteners completely so the trap comes loose, and let the water drain into the bucket.",
        "Hold the trap upside-down over the bucket since it may also have water stuck inside of it.",
        "Feed the end of a drain snake into the waste pipe until you hit the blockage.",
        "Take the round end of the drain snake and position it in the pipe that\u2019s leading away from your sink.",
        "Push about 1 foot (30 cm) of the snake into the pipe by hand before turning the handle clockwise to extend it further.",
        "Keep unwinding the drain snake until you meet resistance or until you run out of wire.",
        "A drain snake has a long wire stored inside of a drum so you can feed it in and out of your pipes without cutting them.",
        "You can buy drain snakes from hardware stores or online.",
        "If you\u2019ve used the full length of the drain snake and you haven\u2019t felt the blockage, then contact a plumber since you have problems further down in your pipes.",
        "Push and pull the snake back and forth if you feel a clog.",
        "Wiggle the snake around the pipe for about 5 seconds before rotating the handle counterclockwise by a half turn.",
        "Forcefully turn the handle clockwise again to force the snake into the blockage.",
        "Continue pushing and pulling the end of the snake into the clog until you don\u2019t feel any more resistance.",
        "If you feel resistance even when you\u2019re pulling the snake back toward you, the clog may have caught on the end.Variation: Some drain snakes allow you to attach a drill to them so you can quickly push and pull them through your pipes.",
        "Check the user manual for your snake to see if it\u2019s compatible.",
        "Turn the handle counterclockwise to retrieve the snake.",
        "Use a slow and steady pace in case the blockage caught on the end of the snake so it doesn\u2019t fall off inside the pipe.",
        "Keep pulling the snake out until you reach the end, and clean off any debris stuck on it with a paper towel.M Make sure the snake is completely inside the drum so you don\u2019t damage or break it.",
        "Wipe the snake with a paper towel or cleaning rag as you retract it to help keep it clean.",
        "Reassemble the pipes and test the drain.",
        "Position the trap back onto the pipes and tighten the nuts or fasteners with your pliers.",
        "Turn your faucet to the hottest setting and run it in 1 side of the sink for 5 minutes to make sure it drains properly.",
        "Then move the faucet so the water runs on the other side of the sink to ensure it doesn\u2019t clog.",
        "If the water still backs up in the sink, contact a plumber to check your drain lines since they may have damage farther than what you\u2019re able to reach."
