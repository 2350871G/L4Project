        "Apply the primer to the wall using a roller or paint brush.",
        "While it\u2019s possible to only apply the stain-blocking primer to the stain, it\u2019s a good idea to apply it to the entire wall to add additional protection and create a cohesive look.",
        "Roll the primer over the stain and rest of the wall using a handheld roller to cover a large area faster.",
        "If you\u2019re only priming a small area, it\u2019s okay to use a paint brush instead.",
        "Pour the primer into a tray if you\u2019re rolling it onto the walls using a roller to make the process easier.",
        "Apply the primer in a thin, even layer, overlapping your strokes as you paint to ensure it\u2019s all covered.",
        "Let the primer dry before deciding if you need additional coats.",
        "It\u2019s best to use 2 coats of primer to be sure it works its best.",
        "Wait for the primer to dry completely after you\u2019ve applied a coat and see if the stain shows through.",
        "If it does, apply 1-2 more coats of the primer to hide it from view.",
        "Read your can of primer to see how long it takes to dry.",
        "Painting over the Marks Use paint from the original can to do touch-ups, if possible.",
        "If you still have the original paint can that was used to paint your walls you're trying to fix, it\u2019s best to use this same paint to paint over any marks.",
        "This will ensure that the paint is an exact match and saves you money.",
        "Mix this paint thoroughly before using it using a mixing stick or other tool because old paint tends to settle.",
        "Choose a top coat in your desired color if you\u2019re painting the entire wall.",
        "If you\u2019re painting the whole wall, even if it\u2019s in the same color, it\u2019s best to purchase new paint to ensure you have enough to cover the entire area.",
        "Visit your local home improvement store and pick out an interior paint in the color and sheen that you\u2019d like.",
        "Buy enough paint to cover your entire wall so you don't have to come back for more.",
        "For example, you might pick out an eggshell sheen for a slightly shiny finish, or a matte sheen for a super low luster finish.",
        "If you're not sure how much paint you need, ask an employee at the store for help.",
        "Roll the paint onto the wall using a roller if you're painting the whole wall.",

        "Look for a paint roller at your local home improvement or paint store.",
        "It's also okay to use a large paint brush, but this will take longer.",
        "Dab the paint on with a paint brush if you\u2019re doing a touch-up.",
        "For smaller areas, it\u2019s easiest to dip a medium-sized paintbrush into your paint and dab it onto the wall gently.",
        "Swipe your brush against the inside of the paint can to remove excess paint before applying it to the wall.",
        "Dab the paint on right overtop the spot you\u2019re hoping to cover up until you can't see the spot anymore.",
        "If the marked spot is especially small, use a small paint brush to avoid applying more paint than you need.",
        "Wait for the paint to dry completely before adding additional coats.",

        "Touch-ups won't take as long to dry as painting the entire wall will.",
        "Your paint can will likely tell you how long your specific type of paint takes to dry."
