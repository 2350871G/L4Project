The bearing is a series of degrees, minutes, and seconds with compass point letters before and after each element. The distance indicates how far from a given point a boundary line extends. The bearing represents the angle between north or south and east or west. You can measure this angle from a central point with a protractor. For instance, you might have a bearing of N 38\u00b0 03' 09\" E.  If you measured an angle of 38\u00b0 03' 09\" from the north to the east on the survey illustration, you could then trace that northeasterly line to identify one of your property's boundaries. Degrees, minutes, and seconds are the units of measure for property survey bearings. For example, N 38\u00b0 03' 09\" E would translate as 38 degrees, 3 minutes, 9 seconds from the north to the east. The boundary lines, or \"legs,\" are often denoted in feet and listed directly below or after the bearing."
