Soak a brush in bleach and wipe it all over the stained area.  Rinse the area thoroughly using a damp cloth to remove any residue.  Dry the wood using a towel or cloth.  Waxed or Polished Wood Use a clean cloth to blot the excess blood.  Mix 1/2 tablespoon of liquid dish-washing detergent with 1 cup of cold water in a small bowl to make a detergent solution.  Dip a clean cloth in the detergent solution.  Wipe the stained area with the cloth to remove the remaining blood stain.  Rinse the area thoroughly using a damp cloth to remove any residue.  Dry the wood using a towel or cloth. Check if the blood stain is still visible. If the stain is still noticeable, dip a superfine steel wool (number 0000) in liquid wax.  Rub the stained area lightly with the steel wool. The steel wool should remove only a fine layer of the surface of the wood. Wipe the surface clean with a soft cloth.  Wax or polish the surface if needed.  Varnished Wood Wipe the blood with a damp sponge.  Rinse the sponge. Repeat the wiping process until all the blood is gone.
