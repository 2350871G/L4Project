Lay the apple down on the side you just cut and make another cut next to the core. Turn the apple to the flat side again and make another cut along the core. Make 1 more cut so that you're left with a square core and 4 large pieces of apple. Although you can use an apple coring tool to remove just the center of the apple, cutting the apple into pieces as you remove the core will give you flat surfaces on which to slice or chop the apple."
