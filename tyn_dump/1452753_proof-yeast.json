Pour 1/4 cup (59 ml) of lukewarm water into a small bowl. Use a food thermometer to measure the temperature of the water. The target temperature is between 110 and 115 degrees F (43-46 degrees C).

Storing the Yeast Protect dried yeast from the elements. Sealed sachets or unopened jars protect dried yeast from heat, light, and moisture. However, once exposed to oxygen, it must be kept in a cool, dry, and dark place. Dried yeast may be stored in a cabinet, pantry, or freezer. Store fresh yeast in the fridge. Refrigerators provide the necessary cool, dry, and dark environment to preserve yeast temporarily. However, because fresh yeast contains moisture, it must be used within two weeks. Organize your storage space. Note the use-by dates on all products in your cabinet or pantry. Place the items with earlier dates, such as yeast, in the front and those with later dates in the back.
