Then, pick out a lip liner or lipstick that you think will work well with the gloss you\u2019ve purchased. The holographic lip gloss will reflect multiple different colors (almost like an oil spill reflecting light), so don't get too wrapped up in the color of the packaging! Think about combinations you love, like a red lip liner with a pinkish holographic lip gloss, or a deep purple lipstick with a light blue holographic lip gloss. Avoid choosing colors on opposite sides of the color wheel. For instance, if you put a green gloss over top of a dark red lip, it will end up looking brown and muddy. You don\u2019t necessarily need to wear a lipstick under your gloss, but it will magnify the effect of the gloss. Putting it on bare lips will be less noticeable than putting it over, say, a dark red or a deep violet."
