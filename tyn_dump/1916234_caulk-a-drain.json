Toss it and replace it with a new one if it is rusted or damaged, or set it aside to reattach later if it looks fine. Twist the shower drain body counterclockwise to unscrew it and remove it.

If you find any damaged parts, you can take them with you to a home improvement store and look for replacements of the same model. Caulking and Putting in the Drain Cut the tip off a tube of caulk with a utility knife. Carefully slice the tip off to make a hole that you can squeeze the caulk out of. Make sure to use silicone bathroom/kitchen/plumbing caulk for your drain to ensure it is waterproof.Warning: Do not use latex caulk because it can become brittle, which will cause the seal to break. It is also prone to problems with mildew and mold. You can get a tube of silicone plumbing caulk at any home improvement store. Insert the tip of the caulk tube into a caulk gun and snap it in place. Put the tip of the caulk tube in the end of the caulk gun furthest from the handle. The rest of the tube will snap easily into place, as long as the tube and the gun are the same size. You can get a caulk gun that fits your caulk tube at a home improvement store. Pull the trigger a few times to prime the tube. Hold the caulk gun at a 45-degree angle over a scrap piece of paper. Pull the trigger until caulk comes out in a steady stream. This will ensure that you can get an even bead of caulk out around the drain. Squeeze a bead of caulk around the drain opening. Hold the tip of the caulk gun at a 45-degree angle to the rim of the drain hole. Squeeze the trigger and slowly move the tip of the caulk gun around the opening until there is an even line of caulk all the way around.

Thoroughly wipe away the caulk that oozes out around the drain after you have tightened it. Throw away the dirty paper towel. Try moistening the paper towel to wipe away the caulk if it is hard to get all of it off with a dry paper towel. Tap the drain clockwise with a screwdriver and hammer to tighten it all the way. Put the tip of the screwdriver against one of the nubs with screw holes inside the drain body.

You can also use some kind of utensil, like pliers, to wedge inside the drain body against the screw hole nubs and tighten it another 1/2 a turn. Replace the drain cover on the drain and screw it down tightly. Align the grid so the screw holes are over the nubs inside the drain body.
