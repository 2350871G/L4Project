Alex is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, and has worked in the kitchens of Jean-Georges and Quince, both Michelin-starred restaurants. Alex Hong\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Because it's so lean, veal can be challenging to cook. It's very similar to pork, in that sometimes you'll touch it and it will feel perfect, but you'll cut into it and it's a little undercooked. Take the time to check the temperature, and you'll see a better result."

Stir in 1 teaspoon (0.5 g) of fresh minced rosemary, 1/4 teaspoon (0.2 g) of chopped fresh thyme, and 1 pinch of salt. Mix until the herbs are incorporated.

Wrap the butter log in plastic and put it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours. You can make the herb butter up to 1 week before you saut\u00e9 the chops. Season the veal rib chops. Lay four 12-ounce (340 g) veal rib chops in a large dish or baking sheet so they're in a single layer. Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the olive oil evenly over the chops.

Take the time to check the temperature, and you'll see a better result. Make a simple pan sauce. Carefully pour off and discard the drippings in the skillet. Turn the heat down to medium-high and pour in 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of dry white wine. Stir and cook the wine for 30 seconds before you pour in 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of chicken broth. Stir and cook the sauce for 30 more seconds. Pour the sauce over the chops and serve them with the herb butter. Drizzle the pan sauce over the saut\u00e9ed veal chops.

For a dry white wine, consider using a chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, or a muscadet. Store leftover veal chops in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. Grilling Herb-Marinated Veal Chops Combine the herb mixture. Get out a small bowl and place 4 minced garlic cloves into it. Zest 1 lemon and add the zest to the bowl along with:\n1 1/2 tablespoons (2.5 g) finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves\n1 tablespoon (2.5 g) chopped fresh tarragon leaves\n2 tablespoons (5 g) chopped fresh thyme leaves\n1 tablespoon (2.5 g) chopped fresh mint leaves\n1 teaspoon (6 g) kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon (1 g) freshly ground black pepper Season the veal chops in a baking pan. Lay 2 pounds (907 g) of veal chops in a baking pan so they're in a single layer. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil evenly over the chops. Stir the herb mixture to combine it and sprinkle half of it over the chops. Rub the oil and herbs into the chops. Turn and season the other side of the veal chops. Flip the chops over and drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon (13 ml) of olive oil over them. Sprinkle the rest of the herbs over the chops and use your fingers to rub the seasonings into the meat. Marinate the seasoned veal chops for at least 6 hours. Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap and put the veal chops in the refrigerator. Chill the chops for at least 6 hours or overnight. Preheat the grill and set the chops out at room temperature. Remove the chops from the refrigerator and let them sit out for 30 minutes. Heat a gas grill to high or heat a chimney full of briquettes for a charcoal grill. Dump the hot coals directly into the grate. If you want a smoky flavor, add a handful of your favorite wood chips right onto the gas burner or on the hot briquettes. The temperature of the grill should reach about 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C).  Arrange the chops on the grill and gook them for 5 to 6 minutes. Once the wood chips start to smoke, lay the chops on the grill. They should be directly over the heat source. Grill the chops for 5 to 6 minutes, if you want medium-done chops. For rarer chops, cook them for 3 to 4 minutes. For well-done chops, try grilling them for 6 to 7 minutes. Turn and grill the chops for another 5 to 6 minutes. Use tongs to flip the chops over and grill them on the other side until they're done. For medium-done chops, this should take 5 to 6 more minutes. Rest and serve the grilled veal chops. Transfer the chops to a serving platter and lay a piece of aluminum foil over the meat. Rest the meat for 3 minutes and then serve the chops while they're still hot. You can store the breaded veal chops in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. Making Breaded Veal Chops Beat the egg with salt and pepper. Crack 1 egg into a shallow bowl or dish. Add \u00bc teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt and ground black pepper to taste. Whisk or beat the egg with a fork until it's combined with the seasonings. Set the mixture aside. Mix the breadcrumbs with the sage. Pour \u00be cup (70 g) of fine dry bread crumbs into another shallow bowl or dish. Stir in 1 tablespoon (3 g) of chopped fresh sage. Place the dish next to the dish with the seasoned egg mixture. If you prefer rosemary, thyme, or your favorite seasoning, you can substitute it for the fresh sage. Pound the veal rib chops to an even thickness. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on your work surface. Place four 5-ounce (141 g) veal rib chops in a single layer on the plastic. Lay another piece of plastic wrap over the ribs. Take a rolling pin and pound the chops until they're all about 1/2-inch (1.3 cm) thick. If you don't want to pound the chops, you'll just need to add another minute of cooking to each side of the chop. Dip the chops in the egg and coat them in the breadcrumbs. Take 1 veal chop and cover it in the beaten egg mixture. Lift the chop up and let the excess egg drip off it. Lay the chop in the breadcrumb mixture and turn it over to coat the other side. Shake the chop so excess breadcrumbs fall back into the dish. Repeat this for each chop. Saut\u00e9 the chops in butter for 4 minutes. Melt 5 tablespoons (70 g) of butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Lay the breaded chops in the butter and cook them until they're golden brown on the bottom. This should take 4 minutes. Avoid turning or moving the chops while they saut\u00e9. The skillet should be at least 12-inches (30 cm) wide. For an Italian version of breaded veal chops, use olive oil to saut\u00e9 the chops instead of butter. Turn and saut\u00e9 the chops for 3 more minutes. Use tongs to flip the veal chops over. Cook them until they're golden on the other side. This should take 3 minutes. Check the temperature of the chops and serve them. Insert a meat thermometer horizontally into the center of the thickest veal chop. For a medium-rare chop, cook it until it reaches 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C). For a well-done chop, cook it until it reaches 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). If they're not finished cooking, saut\u00e9 them for 2 more minutes and check the temperature again. Serve the breaded veal chops. Transfer the cooked chops to serving plates and garnish them with wedges of lemon. Consider serving the chops with arugula salad, pasta, potato salad, or schnitzel.
