Another alternative is to make an appointment with a practitioner of alternative medicine to get a personalized detox and cleansing program. In any case, unless you've done this before and are an old pro at fasting, it's a good idea to talk things over with an expert before you begin. If your doctor decides it's not a good idea for you to do an extreme fast, such as a liquid-only fast, you can still cleanse your body by taking a break from certain types of foods. For example, you could stop eating sugar for a certain amount of time. That way you'll be able to keep your energy up while still getting the benefits of giving your digestive system a break. Don't plan to fast as a way to lose weight. Fasting may cause weight loss, but when you start eating regular meals again, you'll gain it back. \"Yo-yoing\" in this way intentionally can a negative effect on your health."

Some call for liquids and juice alone, while others allow for a dinner of brown rice, steamed vegetables, or other light food. Many call for juice recipes that use specific ingredients and supplements. If this is your first time fasting, consider doing a raw food cleanse. You'll essentially be abstaining from all cooked foods, leaving you free to consume raw fruits, vegetables, and nuts, along with plenty of water. Doing a juice fast is another good way to cleanse your system without giving it too much of a shock. You'll want your juices to contain both fruit and vegetable juice, rather than pure fruit juice, which contains too much sugar to be a healthy option. For most healthy people, it's fine to completely abstain from eating for a limited period (typically up to 3 days) with your doctor's approval. However, fasting for long periods of time may be dangerous if you have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, an eating disorder, or pregnancy. Before doing a long water or juice-based fast, talk to your doctor about how long you can safely go without food."
