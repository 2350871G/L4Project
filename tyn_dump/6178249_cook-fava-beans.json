Continue peeling away the string down the length of the pod until you reach the very end, then use your fingers to pry open the pod along the newly exposed seam. Pluck the individual beans out of the pod using your fingers. Most mature pods will contain four to eight beans. Set up the steamer. Bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to a boil in a small saucepan, then place a steamer basket over the top of the pan. Ideally, the steamer basket should be wide enough to fit the beans in a single layer. Make sure that the boiling water does not touch the bottom of the steamer basket. Only the steam should be allowed to reach the basket. Steam the beans for 30 to 60 seconds. Toss the beans into the basket. Cover the steamer and gently cook the beans for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the outer coating of each bean starts to shrivel. Once the coating shrivels, you should remove the basket of beans from the steamer and allow them to cool for several minutes, just until they are cool enough to handle with your bare hands. Remove the outer coating. Peel away the shriveled skin from each fava bean. Carefully pinch the end of each bean, grabbing the skin without grabbing the bean itself. The inner bean should pop out when you do this. Keep the inner beans and discard the waxy coatings. Steam the beans for another 10 to 15 minutes. Return the beans to the steamer basket, and return the steamer basket to your saucepan of boiling water. Cover and continue steaming until the beans are tender. The exact amount of time will depend on how large the individual beans are. Check the beans for doneness every 5 minutes or so. Even with large beans, the process should not take longer than 15 minutes. Season and serve. Transfer the cooked beans to a serving bowl. Toss with melted butter (or olive oil), salt, and black pepper. Enjoy the beans while they're still hot. Method Two: Saut\u00e9ed Fava Beans Remove the outer shell. Pry open each bean pod and pluck all of the individual beans out of the shell. Snap the tip of the bean near the string/stem end, then peel the string down the entire length of the pod. Use your fingers to pry the pod open along the exposed seam and pick out the individual beans inside. Most pods will contain four to eight beans. Bring water to a boil. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, fill a medium mixing bowl with 1 cup (250 ml) of ice and 3 cups (750 ml) of cold water. Parboil the beans for 30 seconds. Toss the individual fava beans into the boiling water and blanch/parboil them for 30 seconds, or until the skins begin to shrivel. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the blanched beans to your bowl of ice water. Keep them submerged for at least 30 seconds to stop the cooking process. Remove the outer coating. Pinch the tip of each bean. Squeeze down on the loosened skin and push the inner bean forward until it completely pops out. Keep the inner beans and discard the skins. Melt the butter. Place the butter into a small to medium skillet and set it on the stove over medium heat. Melt the butter completely and turn the pan to coat it. If using olive oil instead of butter, heat the oil for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it becomes glossy and easy to move around the pan. Saut\u00e9 the garlic. Add the minced garlic to the melted butter and cook, stirring frequently, for approximately 60 seconds. Cook the garlic until it produces a stronger odor. Minced garlic can burn quickly and will ruin the taste of the dish if it does, so you'll need to stir it continuously during this time. Saut\u00e9 the fava beans. Toss the fava beans into the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes or until the beans become crisp-tender.

Dump the contents of the skillet into a serving bowl, then toss with salt and pepper as desired. Enjoy warm. Method Three: Pur\u00e9ed Fava Beans Remove the outer shell. Break open each bean pod and remove the individual fava beans. Discard the empty shells when finished. Snap off the string/stem end of the pod, then peel the string away down the entire pod length. Use your fingers to pry open the new seam and pluck out the individual beans inside. You should be able to gather four to eight beans from each pod. Remove the inner skins.

Place the oil in a large saucepan and set it on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat up for 30 to 60 seconds. Saut\u00e9 the onion. Toss the diced onion into the oil and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes. The onion should become more aromatic after the first few minutes. Continue cooking it until the pieces become notably soft and slightly translucent. Add the beans, sugar, salt, and 3 cups (750 ml) of water. Toss the four ingredients into the saucepan and stir until evenly combined with the onion. Allow the contents of the saucepan to sit over medium-high heat until the water begins a steady simmer. Simmer for 45 minutes. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue cooking the beans at a gentle simmer until they become very tender. You don't need to stir the beans as they cook, but if you want to stir them to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan, only do so once or twice. Opening the pan too often could cause too much steam to escape and may increase the overall cooking time. Add the lemon juice. Add the lemon juice to the saucepan and simmer, uncovered, for another 5 minutes. Taste the mixture after it simmers. Adjust the seasonings as desired to match your personal sense of taste. Pur\u00e9e the mixture until smooth. Pour the contents of the saucepan into a blender and pur\u00e9e until it becomes thick and smooth. Stop the blender and stir the puree with a spoon to make sure that the mixture is thoroughly mashed. You could also use a food processor instead of a blender during this step. Chill and serve. Pour the fava bean pur\u00e9e into a bowl. Cover and chill the paste in your refrigerator, then enjoy it cold. You can use fava pur\u00e9e as a topping or dip. It can also be garnished with lemon wedges or fresh dill, if desired. Method Four: Roasted Fava Beans Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Prepare a large baking sheet or shallow baking dish by coating it with nonstick cooking spray. To reduce the amount of oil used in this recipe, line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil instead of coating it with cooking spray. Remove the pod string. Snap the end of each bean pod and peel the string down the entire length of the pod. Twist the string at the end of each pod to remove it. For this cooking method, you actually need to keep the beans in their pods. Do not pry open the pod after removing the string and do not try to pluck out the individual beans.

        "Steam the beans for another 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Return the beans to the steamer basket, and return the steamer basket to your saucepan of boiling water.",
        "Cover and continue steaming until the beans are tender.",
        "The exact amount of time will depend on how large the individual beans are.",
        "Check the beans for doneness every 5 minutes or so.",
        "Even with large beans, the process should not take longer than 15 minutes.",
        "Season and serve.",
        "Transfer the cooked beans to a serving bowl.",
        "Toss with melted butter (or olive oil), salt, and black pepper.",
        "Enjoy the beans while they're still hot.",
        "Method Two: Saut\u00e9ed Fava Beans Remove the outer shell.",
        "Pry open each bean pod and pluck all of the individual beans out of the shell.",
        "Snap the tip of the bean near the string/stem end, then peel the string down the entire length of the pod.",
        "Use your fingers to pry the pod open along the exposed seam and pick out the individual beans inside.",
        "Most pods will contain four to eight beans.",
        "Bring water to a boil.",
        "Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat.",
        "Meanwhile, fill a medium mixing bowl with 1 cup (250 ml) of ice and 3 cups (750 ml) of cold water.",
        "Parboil the beans for 30 seconds.",
        "Toss the individual fava beans into the boiling water and blanch/parboil them for 30 seconds, or until the skins begin to shrivel.",
        "Use a slotted spoon to transfer the blanched beans to your bowl of ice water.",
        "Keep them submerged for at least 30 seconds to stop the cooking process.",
        "Remove the outer coating.",
        "Pinch the tip of each bean.",
        "Squeeze down on the loosened skin and push the inner bean forward until it completely pops out.",
        "Keep the inner beans and discard the skins.",
        "Melt the butter.",
        "Place the butter into a small to medium skillet and set it on the stove over medium heat.",
        "Melt the butter completely and turn the pan to coat it.",
        "If using olive oil instead of butter, heat the oil for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it becomes glossy and easy to move around the pan.",
        "Saut\u00e9 the garlic.",
        "Add the minced garlic to the melted butter and cook, stirring frequently, for approximately 60 seconds.",
        "Cook the garlic until it produces a stronger odor.",
        "Minced garlic can burn quickly and will ruin the taste of the dish if it does, so you'll need to stir it continuously during this time.",
        "Saut\u00e9 the fava beans.",
        "Toss the fava beans into the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes or until the beans become crisp-tender.",
        "You can saut\u00e9 the beans for more or less time depending on your desired level of doneness.",
        "Test for doneness by simply piercing one bean with a fork.",
        "Season and serve.",
        "Dump the contents of the skillet into a serving bowl, then toss with salt and pepper as desired.",
        "Enjoy warm.",
        "Method Three: Pur\u00e9ed Fava Beans Remove the outer shell.",
        "Break open each bean pod and remove the individual fava beans.",
        "Discard the empty shells when finished.",
        "Snap off the string/stem end of the pod, then peel the string away down the entire pod length.",
        "Use your fingers to pry open the new seam and pluck out the individual beans inside.",
        "You should be able to gather four to eight beans from each pod.",
        "Remove the inner skins.",
        "The skins covering each bean also need to be removed.",
        "Do so by quickly steaming or blanching the beans until the skins shrivel up.",
        "Steam the beans in a steamer basket set over boiling water for roughly 1 minute.",
        "Let them cool, then peel or pop the beans out of their skins by applying light pressure to one end.",
        "Parboil/blanch the beans by submerging them in boiling water for 30 seconds.",
        "Transfer the beans to a bowl of ice water for another 30 seconds, then peel or pop them out of their skins.",
        "Heat the oil.",
        "Place the oil in a large saucepan and set it on the stove over medium-high heat.",
        "Allow the oil to heat up for 30 to 60 seconds.",
        "Saut\u00e9 the onion.",
        "Toss the diced onion into the oil and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "The onion should become more aromatic after the first few minutes.",
        "Continue cooking it until the pieces become notably soft and slightly translucent.",
        "Add the beans, sugar, salt, and 3 cups (750 ml) of water.",
        "Toss the four ingredients into the saucepan and stir until evenly combined with the onion.",
        "Allow the contents of the saucepan to sit over medium-high heat until the water begins a steady simmer.",
        "Simmer for 45 minutes.",
        "Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low.",
        "Continue cooking the beans at a gentle simmer until they become very tender.",
        "You don't need to stir the beans as they cook, but if you want to stir them to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan, only do so once or twice.",
        "Opening the pan too often could cause too much steam to escape and may increase the overall cooking time.",
        "Add the lemon juice.",
        "Add the lemon juice to the saucepan and simmer, uncovered, for another 5 minutes.",
        "Taste the mixture after it simmers.",
        "Adjust the seasonings as desired to match your personal sense of taste.",
        "Pur\u00e9e the mixture until smooth.",
        "Pour the contents of the saucepan into a blender and pur\u00e9e until it becomes thick and smooth.",
        "Stop the blender and stir the puree with a spoon to make sure that the mixture is thoroughly mashed.",
        "You could also use a food processor instead of a blender during this step.",
        "Chill and serve.",
        "Pour the fava bean pur\u00e9e into a bowl.",
        "Cover and chill the paste in your refrigerator, then enjoy it cold.",
        "You can use fava pur\u00e9e as a topping or dip.",
        "It can also be garnished with lemon wedges or fresh dill, if desired.",
        "Method Four: Roasted Fava Beans Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).",
        "Prepare a large baking sheet or shallow baking dish by coating it with nonstick cooking spray.",
        "To reduce the amount of oil used in this recipe, line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil instead of coating it with cooking spray.",
        "Remove the pod string.",
        "Snap the end of each bean pod and peel the string down the entire length of the pod.",
        "Twist the string at the end of each pod to remove it.",
        "For this cooking method, you actually need to keep the beans in their pods.",
        "Do not pry open the pod after removing the string and do not try to pluck out the individual beans.",
        "Rinse and dry the beans.",
        "Fill a large mixing bowl with cool, fresh water and submerge the beans.",
        "Use your fingers to gently scrub away any dirt and debris.",
        "When the water becomes notably dirty, dump it and add more fresh water to the bowl.",
        "Do this once or twice, or until the soaking water remains clear.",
        "After cleaning them, dry the bean pods with clean paper towels.",
        "Place the beans on your baking sheet.",
        "Arrange the fava bean pods on your prepared baking sheet in a single layer.",
        "Try to arrange the pods so that the split sides face upward.",
        "Doing so is not absolutely crucial, but it will help make it easier for the salt and oil to seep inside and flavor the individual beans.",
        "Season with oil and salt.",
        "Sprinkle the pods with salt, then drizzle them with oil.",
        "Gently rock or shake the pan afterward to coat the bean pods more evenly.",
        "Roast for 25 to 30 minutes.",
        "Place the beans in your preheated oven and cook them until the pods become soft and lightly browned.",
        "This will usually take 25 to 30 minutes.",
        "Use a serving spatula to stir the beans halfway through the roasting process.",
        "Doing so promotes more even cooking.",
        "Adjust the seasonings and serve.",
        "Remove the roasted beans from the oven and sprinkle with black pepper.",
        "Enjoy the beans immediately or wait until they cool to room temperature.",
        "Note that small roasted bean pods can actually be eaten whole.",
        "Large fava bean pods will have a stringy texture, though, so you should pop the beans out of the shell using your fingers.",
        "Eat only the individual beans and not the bean pod."
