Each stall should have a permanent opening of at least a one square foot (0.3m) to ensure that the excess ammonia gas can leave the stall. You can make this opening a long slot, rather than a square, so that it\u2019s easier to leave open permanently. For example, you could cut a slot that\u2019s 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and 12 feet (3.7 m) long, placing it along the length of the stall. If possible, place the slot near the ceiling of the stable, which allows the freshest air to circulate into the stall. In high concentrations, ammonia can cause respiratory damage and even death."
