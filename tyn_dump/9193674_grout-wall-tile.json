If you don\u2019t put on safety protection, you could potentially hurt yourself. This is especially true for eye protection, as you may get grout in your eyes without it. Make sure the room you\u2019re working in is properly ventilated. To do this, open nearby windows and doors. If you have a bathroom vent, turn it on. Tape plastic covers to surrounding walls and floors. Use painters tape to secure plastic to the area directly underneath where you\u2019ll be working with grout.

If you just laid new tile, you\u2019ll want to remove the spacers you used to keep them in a grid pattern. Use needle-nose pliers to remove them. In the end, if you forget to remove them, you\u2019ll wind up putting grout right over them. This could cause your grout to decay rapidly in the future. Mix your grout until it is smooth and consistent. Read the directions on your grout product. Then, pour the appropriate amount of water into a bucket. Add the amount of grout powder the package specifies. Use a trowel or a paddle mixer attached to a drill to mix the grout until it has a consistency like toothpaste.

For example, you can use a toothbrush handle. Don\u2019t use a metal tool. This could damage the tile. Cleaning the Tiled Surface Fill a bucket with clean water. Get a 2-gallon (7.6 l) bucket and fill it up with water. While you can use warm water, cool water will work well in most circumstances. This water will be used to help clean excess grout off the tile. If you\u2019ll be grouting a large wall area, you may want to fill two buckets up. Use a sponge to wipe off excess grout. Wait about 20 to 30 minutes after you first applied the grout. Then, use your sponge to wipe the tile back and forth. Focus on the surface of the tile, not the joints.
