If a hair dryer isn\u2019t available, you can try another heat source. Leaving it near a hot stove, open flame, furnace, or in a steamy bathroom may encourage the adhesive to melt."

Avoid rushing, however. Lift the corner carefully, but don\u2019t attempt to peel off the rest of the glass. Try all the corners. You can usually find 1 that lifts away from what is underneath it. If none of them come up, heat the glass a second time to loosen the glue.
