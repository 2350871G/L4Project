The more sophisticated male will be content with enjoying the beverages and spending time with old friends and making new ones. Hopefully you will even remember these friends and be able to plan future meet ups. If you're in a place known for an excellent imported beer selection you should try the beer. Ask the bartender or server for their recommendation. If the restaurant is known for wine or their vast collection of quality liquors you should discuss it with someone who knows.

Remove excessive personal information and never include an annual salary. Misleading information seems immature and it really isn't anyone's business anyway. Stop hanging out in college bars, seedy sports joints and dive clubs. The real movers and shakers will pay higher covers and higher drink prices to be seen with a better class of people. Instead, get your friends to ditch the casual t-shirts and get dressed up to meet you at higher end locations. Remember, it isn't about getting wasted with your friends anymore, it's about being seen, networking and getting to know other people. Be more selective with your beverage choices. Your days of getting the most cheap beer for the buck is gone! Instead of going for low quality domestic beers you should look to nice imported beers or a classic cocktail like vodka tonics, martinis, or a well drink. Try some different cocktails and find one you like and can sip. Not all bars have a great wine selection so you should have a backup cocktail preference. As your income increases you can improve your preference to higher quality beverages and top shelf cocktails. Avoid getting into drinking contest. Shots are for getting very intoxicated quickly. The more sophisticated male will be content with enjoying the beverages and spending time with old friends and making new ones. Hopefully you will even remember these friends and be able to plan future meet ups. If you're in a place known for an excellent imported beer selection you should try the beer. Ask the bartender or server for their recommendation. If the restaurant is known for wine or their vast collection of quality liquors you should discuss it with someone who knows. Don't be afraid to discuss the menu. Make notes in your phone when you find something you really like. Being sophisticated and cultured doesn't mean showing off from outside. You should be a gentleman from within too. Keep your thoughts clean like you clean yourself.",
