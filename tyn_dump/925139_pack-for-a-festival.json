Put your tickets and parking passes in a safe place, either in your car or in a special pocket. Double check the festival's website to find out if there is any other paperwork you will need.

Bring 2 or 3 water bottles to refill and carry with you throughout the festival. Purchase enough containers of water to last each day if the festival does not provide fill up stations. CamelBak packs can be great for festivals because they're hydration packs that allow you to carry water that can be obtained through an attached tube."

Consider bringing two or three bottles to share with friends if you are attending a multiple-day festival. Being outside for multiple days also means that your eyes are at risk from sun damage, so bring two pairs of sunglasses. You never know when you may lose a pair while dancing.
