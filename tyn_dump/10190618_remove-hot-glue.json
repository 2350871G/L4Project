Cleaning Hot Glue from Carpet Place a scrap piece of fabric over the glue. Hot glue will stick to most fabrics better than carpet. Make sure the fabric is something you are able to toss out after removing the glue. Heat an iron to medium-high heat and press it directly on the fabric over the glue.

Use gloves when handling the iron and fabric. The fabric will be hot and could cause pain or burning when touched. Check to make sure all of the glue has transferred to the fabric. Carefully set down the iron and lift the fabric from the carpet. If all of the glue has not been removed, use another piece of fabric and repeat the process. If this technique does not remove the glue, seek a carpet specialist to assist you. Clean the affected carpet area with a carpet cleaner. After removing the glue, gently clean the area with a carpet cleaner to catch any small lumps of glue that may still be there. If you do not have any carpet cleaner, running over the area with water will also be effective.",
