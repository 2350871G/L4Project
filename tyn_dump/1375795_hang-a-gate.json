Place one of the posts into its hole and while holding it as level as you can, pour dry concrete into the hole until it is half filled.  Pour in roughly 5 inches (or 12.7 centimeters) of water and let the mix soak for a minute or two.  Fill the hole to about 5 inches (or 12.7 centimeters) from the top with more of the dry mix, adding another 5 inches (or 12.7 centimeters) of water until the hole is filled.  Add water as it is absorbed by the dry concrete until the mixture is thick enough to hold the post upright.  Repeat this process for the post on the opposite side.  Leave the posts to set for a day or two, or until the concrete is completely hardened.

Drill a hole through the hinge post as straight as you can using a spade bit.  Screw a nut and a washer 1 inch (or 2.5 centimeters) onto the threaded end of the vertical hinge pin, and push it through the hole, so that the pin is pointed straight up.
