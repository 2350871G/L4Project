Continue rolling until the entire towel is rolled up. Getting Ready to Snap Wrap one end of the towel around your dominant hand. Place one end of the towel in the palm of your hand and wrap it around the back of your hand once. The towel can act as a handle and will give you more control over your whip. Hold the other end of the towel with your hand so that it doesn\u2019t unravel. If your towel comes undone, it will become loose and will not be as effective. Make sure that you keep it rolled up before you snap it. Wet the other tip of the towel. Dip the end of the towel that you're not holding into water and get it fully saturated. Getting it wet will help with the snapping action when you whip your towel. The entire process of creating a towel whip should only take around 10-20 seconds. Grab both ends and wind up the towel for a quick whip. If you don't have time to prepare a whip, you can create a quick one. Hold onto both ends of the towel and move your hands around in circles to rotate the towel in one direction. This should spin the towel on top of itself and create a whip.

Instead, stand sideways, so that your dominant shoulder is pointed towards the target. Turn your head so that you can see what you\u2019re whipping. Lean in and release the towel from your nondominant hand. Lean into your target and slightly bend your dominant leg. Release one end of the towel so that it can extend and go towards your target. Flick your dominant wrist. Quickly flick your wrist towards your target, immediately after letting go of the towel with your nondominant hand. The towel should shoot forwards towards your target. Try to hit the target with the tip of your towel. Try to aim the towel so that the tip hits your target. This is the most painful part of the towel to be whipped with. Practice the snapping motion. The more that you practice, the more accurate your towel whips will be. Practice on an inanimate object and try to hit a specific part of the object.
