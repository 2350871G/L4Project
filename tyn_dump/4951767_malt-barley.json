As the barley is draining, clean the soaking bucket with hot, soapy water. Rinse the bucket well to remove any soap residue. This will help to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi. It\u2019s important to drain and air dry the barley between soakings, because the barley will die if it doesn\u2019t get enough air. Air rest the grains for 8 hours. Transfer the drained barley from the colander back to the cleaned soaking bucket. Leave the barley to air dry in the same cool location for 8 hours to give the grains access to plenty of oxygen. While the grains are air resting, clean the colander with hot, soapy water. Repeat the soaking and drying process. When the barley has been air rested for 8 hours, fill the bucket with enough cool water to completely cover the grains. Leave the barley to soak for another 8 hours. After that time, drain the barley in the colander and transfer it back to the bucket to air rest for another 8 hours. Be sure to clean the bucket and colander with hot, soapy water between uses. Examine the barley for chits. Pick up a handful of grains and look for small white protrusions growing from the bottom of the grains. These are chits, and they're rootlets that appear when the barley has absorbed enough water. The soaking and air drying cycles are complete when about 95 percent of the grains have chitted.

If the barley doesn\u2019t chit after 3 or 4 soaking and drying cycles, it may not be viable, which means it won\u2019t sprout. Discard the barley and start again with a new batch. Germinating the Barley Spread the barley out in a single layer on baking sheets. Transfer the barley to 1 or more clean baking sheets. Use your hand to spread out the grains. The grains can be touching, but make sure they're not piled on top of each other. For large batches of barley, you'll need to use multiple baking sheets. Place the baking sheets inside plastic bags. Open up a large plastic garbage bag and lay it down flat. Insert a baking sheet filled with barley inside the bag, and fold the opening of the bag under the baking sheet. The plastic will keep the barley moist as it germinates. Repeat with the other baking sheets. Store the barley in a cool and well-ventilated area. The ideal temperature for germination is 64 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C). Good places for germination include well-ventilated root cellars, garages, and basements.

Drying the barley at a low temperature will stop the germination process and remove excess moisture from the grains. Dry the barley for up to 24 hours in a dehydrator. Set the dehydrator to 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) and turn it on. Leave the barley to dry for 6 to 8 hours, and then test it for doneness. Pull the rootlets attached to the grain. If they separate easily from the grain, the barley is sufficiently dry. Otherwise, continue dehydrating the barley until the rootlets start to fall off easily.

Sun-dry the grains in warm climates if necessary. If you don\u2019t have a dehydrator or suitable oven, you can dry the barley in the sun in warm, dry climates.

        "Don\u2019t dry the barley in an oven that can't go as low as 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C), because drying the barley at too high a temperature will destroy the enzymes in the grain.",

        "Bring in the barley immediately if it starts to rain.",
        "Remove the rootlets.",
        "When the barley is sufficiently dry that the rootlets fall off easily, turn off the dehydrator or oven, or bring the barley in from outside.",
        "Transfer the dried barley to a colander and shake the colander to remove the rootlets.",

        "Store the barley in an airtight container.",
        "Transfer the malted and dried barley to an airtight container, such as a mason jar, food storage container, or freezer bag.",
        "Store the grains in a cool, dry location, for up to a year.",
        "A good place for barley storage is a dry root cellar, or the refrigerator if you have room."
