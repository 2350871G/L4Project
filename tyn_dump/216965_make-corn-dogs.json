Push the skewer carefully through the length of the hot dog, stopping about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the other end. Repeat with the remaining hot dogs. Try to get the skewer to slide straight through the hot dog, so it doesn't poke out through the side. If your hot dogs are heavy, you might want to slide the skewer closer to the other tip."
