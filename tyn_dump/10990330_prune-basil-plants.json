                    "description": "The last thing you want to do is prune your plant too early. Your basil plant needs to be at least 6 inches (15 cm) tall before you start pruning. This will ensure that there are 5-6 sets of leaves coming from the stem of the plant. Having at least 5-6 sets of leaves is important, because you want to have 1-2 sets of leaves left when you cut it. These leaves are essential for converting sunlight into energy for your basil plant."

Cutting the main stem will yield two new stems growing from it. Be gentle when handling your plant. Basil is very sensitive and can bruise easily."

Make sure there are at least 1 or 2 sets of leaves left at the bottom of your stem. These leaves are necessary for the continued growth of your basil plant.

Flower growth is a sign that your basil plant has switched from growth mode to reproductive mode.

You can also store the basil by air-drying it. For this method, remove the leaves from the stem and place them in a shady area. After about 3-4 days your basil should be dry.
