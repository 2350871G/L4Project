A \"bumper\" case that wraps around the front edge of a phone can provide fairly effective yet stylish impact protection. Keep it out of back pockets and other crush danger areas. Ideal protection means getting a screen protector and a good case; a screen protector or case should ideally break and need replacement while protecting your phone from drops."
