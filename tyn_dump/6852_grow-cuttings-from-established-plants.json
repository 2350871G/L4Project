Choose the method that best applies to your situation. You can use the soil method for herbaceous and hardwood cuttings. Using the Soil Method Scrape off the bark on the bottom of hardwood cuttings. Scrape off the top layer of bark near the bottom of your cutting with your pruners. Make sure not to cut too deep or you may damage the branch.
