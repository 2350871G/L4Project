        "If the tear is very small, you may need to apply the glue with a cotton swab or toothpick to make sure you can insert it in the ripped area and apply it to the back side of the tear.",
        "Push the ripped sides together.",
        "Holding your hands firmly on the leather material, push the 2 ripped edges together so that they are touching and push down against the leather backing.",
        "This will connect the 2 sides together and glue them to the leather backing for more support.",
        "Be sure to wipe up any excess glue with a clean rag or paper towel so that it does not dry in place.",
        "Sand the surface of the leather and the adhesive glue gently.",
        "In order to blend the dried glue into the surface of the leather, you\u2019ll need to sand it very gently.",
        "Use a 320-grit piece of sandpaper and rub it softly over the surface of the tear.",
        "You should continue sanding until there is no obvious sign of the adhesive bubbling out from the rip and no cracks in the surface of the leather.",
        "Be sure to sand in the direction of the tear (if it\u2019s a rip, not a circular hole).",
        "Commence the sanding as soon as you glue the pieces together so that the glue doesn\u2019t have time to fully dry.",
        "This will help the finished product look more natural, as you\u2019ll have to sand less vigorously than if there were big splotches of hardened glue to sand down.",
        "Dab the first coat of leather finish on with a sponge.",
        "Use a sponge or clean rag to apply some leather finish to the repaired rip in the leather.",
        "Carefully dip the sponge (or rag) into the top of the leather finish canister until it is covered with a thin layer, but not dripping.",
        "Dab a thin layer of the leather finish onto the surface of the leather.",
        "Let the leather finish dry completely before moving on.",
        "It\u2019s important that you let the first coat of the leather finish dry completely before moving on to the second layer.",
        "It will typically take about 2 hours for each layer to dry completely.",
        "Use a hairdryer on the lowest setting to speed up the drying time.",
        "Direct the heat at the surface of the leather for 5 minutes or less at a time.",
        "Apply several layers of leather finish, letting each layer dry in between.",
        "You will probably need a half dozen or more layers of leather finish before the repaired portion begins to blend with the rest of the leather chair.",
        "Be sure each previous coat is completely dry before starting on the next coat.",
        "The finish acts as a protective seal for the leather, much like stain on hardwood floors.",
        "Applying several layers of finish will help protect the surface of the leather and make your repair last longer.",
        "Conditioning the Leather Use conditioning wipes once a week to clean and condition the leather.",
        "Purchase some leather conditioning wipes from your local home improvement store or from an online retailer.",
        "Gently rub the leather surface with the conditioning wipes to help keep the material clean and conditioned.",
        "You can use them periodically \u2013 once a week or so \u2013 to maintain the sheen of your leather chair.",
        "Condition with distilled water and liquid soap for a gentle cleaning.",
        "To condition and clean the surface of your leather, add a few drops of a pH-neutral non-detergent liquid soap to a spray bottle filled with distilled water.",
        "Shake the bottle to ensure proper mixing of the solution.",
        "Use a clean microfiber cloth, dampened with the cleaning solution, to gently wipe down the surface of the leather.",
        "Once you have finished, use a separate microfiber towel to wipe the leather with plain distilled water.",
        "This will remove any soapy residue.",
        "Then let your leather completely air dry before sitting on it again.",
        "Using distilled water will ensure that you are not exposing your leather to harmful irritants or allergens that can be present in regular tap water \u2013 like trace amounts of heavy metals like iron, copper, magnesium, and zinc, as well as other elements.",
        "Wipe on a mixture of vinegar and linseed oil every few months.",
        "For a deep cleaning, wipe your leather chair down with a clean microfiber cloth so that it is clean and free of any dust particles.",
        "Combine 1 part white vinegar with 2 parts linseed oil in a spray bottle.",
        "Shake the bottle to thoroughly mix the solution.",
        "Spray the solution directly onto a small section of the leather, then use a clean rag to work the oil into the surface.",
        "Move the rag in small, circular motions to really penetrate the surface of the leather.",
        "Next, move onto the next area of leather until you\u2019ve finished covering the entire chair.",
        "Let the solution absorb into the leather surface for 8-10 hours.",
        "Then, buff it with a clean microfiber towel."
