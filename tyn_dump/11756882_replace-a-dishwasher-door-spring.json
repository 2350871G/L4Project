        "On this sticker, look for a model number.",
        "Use this model number to find a replacement door spring or link kit online.",
        "These pieces are not universal, so you need to buy a door spring or link kit for your specific dishwasher\u2019s brand and model number.",
        "The description for a replacement door spring or link kit will list the model numbers it will work with.",
        "The link kit is often called a pulley system or door cable.",
        "Both of these pieces typically cost $5-15 each.",
        "Installing a New Door Spring Remove the old door spring from the frame.",
        "One end of the spring hooks on the cord of the link kit and the other end hooks directly on to the frame of the door.",
        "Pull the spring out 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) and slide the link kit cord off of the spring.",
        "Then, simply pull the other end of the spring off of the frame.",
        "Attach the new spring to the end of the cord on the link kit.",
        "Take your new spring and slide the hole on the end of the link kit cord over the hook of the new door spring.",
        "Pull the door spring a little to make the link kit cord taut.",
        "Inspect the cord to make sure that it is still sitting along the grooves of each pulley roller.Tip: The pulley rollers are the small discs that guide the link kit cord through the back and side of the machine.",
        "The cord must rest on the groove in the middle of each pulley roller.",
        "If the cord fell off of this track when you took the old spring off, put the cord back into place along the center of each roller.",
        "The hooks of the door spring are symmetrical and identical.",
        "You can use either end of the door spring to do this.",
        "Pull the door spring far enough to hook on to the frame.",
        "Brace the end of the door spring that is connected to the link kit cord by holding it steady.",
        "Use your other hand to pull the end of the door spring out 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm).",
        "Hang the second hook around the edge of the washer frame and slide the hook through the small hole on the frame where the original door spring was installed.",
        "The tension from the door spring is more than enough to hold the hooks in place.",
        "Slide the dishwasher back into place and reconnect it.",
        "Gently slide the dishwasher back into place.",
        "If you unscrewed it from the cabinet, reinstall the screws.",
        "If you lowered the legs, use your wrench to readjust the legs until the top of the dishwasher is pressing against the top of the countertop.",
        "If you took the garbage disposal hose out, reattach it the same way you took it off.",
        "Swapping out the Link Kit Remove the old cord from the spring and door to pull it out.",
        "Unhook the end of the link kit cord from the door spring.",
        "Let the door spring hang in the door frame from the hole in the frame.",
        "At the bottom of the dishwasher door, there is a hook holding the other end of the cord on the door.",
        "Slide this part of the cord off of the hook.",
        "Then, simply lift out the old cord.",
        "If you are replacing the link kit cords on both sides, you will need to repeat these steps on each side.",
        "Unscrew the old pulley rollers if they\u2019re old or worn down.",
        "If the cord was broken but the round rollers that hold it in place are fine, you don\u2019t need to replace them.",
        "If they look like they\u2019re in rough shape though, grab a screwdriver or socket wrench and remove the screw or bolt in the middle of each roller.",
        "The pulley rollers will pop right out of the frame with the screws or bolts removed.",
        "The pulley rollers are the 2 round discs that sit at the bottom of the frame on the back of the machine.",
        "When the door opens or closes, the rollers hold the cord connected to the door spring in place and keep it from sliding all over the place.",
        "Install the new pulley rollers using your new screws.",
        "The 2-3 pulley rollers usually come in one piece, so orient the rollers the same way they were previously installed.",
        "Push the pins on the back of the roller into the corresponding holes on the frame.",
        "Then, use your new screws to attach the rollers to the frame and hold them in place.Variation: If you only have 2 pulley rollers, you may need to slide the top roller into the slot on the frame with the bottom roller sticking out to the side to fit it into the slot.",
        "Then, rotate the bottom roller into position by using the top roller as a hinge.",
        "This style of link kit has an oddly-shaped peg on the top roller to lock it in place without a screw.",
        "Hang the link cord on the hook at the base of the door.",
        "Take one end of the link kit cord and hang it on the hook at the bottom of the dishwasher.",
        "Like the door spring, the link kit cord is typically identical on both sides, so you can hang either end of the cord on the hook.",
        "Run the cord through the pulley rollers and hook it on your door spring.",
        "Starting on the end that is hooked on the door, pull the cord gently to keep it taut.",
        "Set the cord on the top pulley roller on the groove in the middle of the disc.",
        "Then, run the cord back under the top roller and pull it around the side of the bottom roller.",
        "Run the remaining length of cord to the door spring.",
        "Pull the door spring out 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) and hang the remaining end of the cord on the hook of the door spring.",
        "When it\u2019s hanging on the rollers, the cord should look like the letter S. Test the door and put the washer back where it originally was.",
        "Open and close the dishwasher door slowly.",
        "While you\u2019re opening and closing it, watch the cord as it slides around the rollers.",
        "Once you\u2019re sure that the cords are sliding around the pulley rollers correctly, slide the dishwasher back into place.",
        "Screw the dishwasher back into the cabinet or use your wrench to raise the legs again.",
        "Reattach the back panel and garbage disposal hose as needed.",
        "Some link kits have a third roller in the middle of the frame to keep the cord from sliding around on the back of the machine.",
        "If you have one, place the cord on top of it when you attach the other end of the cord to the door spring."
