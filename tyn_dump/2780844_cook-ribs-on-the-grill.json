You can use a combination of ingredients, such as soy sauce, chicken broth, worcestershire sauce, vinegar, lemon, lime sugar, cumin, garlic, onion powder, chile powder, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. For a simple marinade, try 0.75 cups (180 mL) of chicken broth, 0.75 cups (180 mL) of soy sauce, 0.5 cup (100 g) of sugar, 6 tablespoons (89 mL) of apple cider vinegar, and 6 tablespoons (89 mL) of olive oil. Add 3 cloves of minced garlic, and stir to combine. Pour 2/3 of the marinade over the meat in a shallow dish and let it sit overnight, flipping the meat occasionally. Some cooks swear by marinades, while others prefer dry rubs. The truth is, you can use both when cooking ribs. The marinade will soak into the main part of the meat, making it flavorful and juicy, while the dry rub will work on the outside of the meat. If you don't have time to marinate the ribs overnight, give them at least a couple of hours."

Pre-cooking the Ribs Low and Slow Heat the ribs in the oven at 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C) for an easy method. Cover a baking tray with aluminum foil, then set a wire baking rack in it. Place the ribs bone-side down in the tray, and heat them for 30 minutes. Brush marinade on both sides of the ribs and turn them over. Keep brushing the ribs with the marinade and turning them every 30 minutes or so for 2-4 hours. Check that the internal temperature reaches 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Use an instant pressure cooker to quickly cook and tenderize the meat. Pour some marinade in the bottom of the pot. Lean the ribs against the inside of the pot and each other so they're standing on end. Place the lid on the pot, and bring the pot to high pressure for 9 minutes, and then let it slowly release pressure over 10 minutes. Carefully release the rest of the pressure by opening the valve on top. Keep your hands and face out of the way of the steam. Place the ribs in a smoker at 225 \u00b0F (107 \u00b0C) for extra smokiness. Put the ribs bone-side down in the smoker. Brush the ribs every hour or so with the marinade. Cook the ribs for 4 to 5 hours, until they reach an internal temperature of 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Any kind of smoker will work for this process, as long as you maintain a constant temperature. Try cherry, apple, or mesquite wood for a flavorful smoke. Grill over indirect heat for one-method cooking. Oil the grill first. To create indirect heat, either pile the charcoal on one side or light only one part of the grill. Set the meat bone-side down off to one side. Do not place it directly over the heat. Cook each side of the meat for 30 minutes, applying marinade several times. If the ribs aren't fork-tender yet, cook them for longer. Aim for 225 \u00b0F (107 \u00b0C) for a gas grill.

Finishing the Ribs over Direct Heat Move the ribs to direct heat on the grill. Whatever method you used to cook your ribs low-and-slow, you can move them to the grill at this point. Heat an oiled grill to about 225 \u00b0F (107 \u00b0C) or a bit higher before setting the ribs over the direct heat. Baste with barbecue sauce or marinade.
