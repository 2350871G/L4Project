        "Cook a couple of pieces at a time so you can monitor them more closely.",
        "As you put the next batch in the oil, bread the next batch inline, and set it to the side to drip off a little.",
        "Remove the food with a skimmer or slotted spoon when it turns golden brown.",
        "Sometimes, the food can take as little as 30 seconds to cook, particularly if the inside is already cooked when you bread it.",
        "Other foods may take 2-3 minutes.",
        "Some foods will float when they're cooked through but not everything will.",
        "For instance, fried shrimp will take about 1 minute, while tempura vegetables will generally take 1 1/2-2 minutes.",
        "If you're not sure if the inside is done, cut into a piece to see it if is cooked through.",
        "Let the food drain on paper towels.",
        "Some of the grease will drain away, making it a bit healthier.",
        "You can also drain it on a wire rack over a baking pan.",
        "You can pat some of the grease off the top of the food, too.",
        "To keep food warm, set it in an oven preheated to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C).",
        "Shallow-Frying Create a coating for your food.",
        "Create a mixture of flour and a couple of dashes of seasoned salt.",
        "Mix 1 cup (240 mL) of water or buttermilk, 2 large egg whites, and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of vodka or other neutral alcohol for an egg mix.",
        "Dip the food in the flour mixture, then in the egg mix.",
        "Next, dip the food in breadcrumbs, flour, cracker crumbs, or cornmeal to finish the breading.",
        "Try cornmeal for fish or vegetables like squash, flour for chicken or cube steak, and cornmeal or cracker crumbs for chicken tenders.",
        "You can add any seasonings you'd like to the second coating, such as onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.",
        "This coating works well for things like chicken, cube steak (chicken fried steak), tomato, squash, and onion.",
        "You can also just use flour for a light coating, which works well on fish.",
        "Let the pieces rest on a wire rack for a few minutes to help the coating adhere better.",
        "Heat a deep skillet over medium-high heat.",
        "The skillet should be deep enough to hold the food you're frying.",
        "Heating the pan before the oil helps to prevent food from sticking.",
        "Wait a few minutes for the pan to heat up.",
        "Heavy-bottomed skillets will cook food more evenly.",
        "Pour enough oil into the skillet so it will come halfway up the sides of the food.",
        "Once the oil has heated for a bit, drop a bit of water into it.",
        "It should sizzle and pop if it's hot enough.",
        "If your recipe specifies a temperature, use a frying thermometer to check the oil.",
        "Set the food lightly in the pan.",
        "Use tongs or a long-handled spatula to gently set the food down.",
        "You don't want the hot grease to splatter on you, as it can burn.",
        "Put the side down first that you want to be the crunchiest and look the best.",
        "Cook the food in batches.",
        "If you crowd the pan, you'll end up with soggy coatings.",
        "Crowding produces steam, so you'll be steaming the coating instead of frying it to a nice crisp.",
        "Keep food apart so it doesn't touch while cooking.",
        "As you cook one batch, bread the next set of food, getting it ready to go in the oil.",
        "Remove the food when it turns golden brown.",
        "Cook chicken pieces to an internal temperature of at least 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), beef to at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) or 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C) if you want it well-done, and pork to 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C).",
        "When cooking potatoes or coated vegetables, they should be golden brown when done.",
        "Flip the food only once.",
        "If you flip the food more often, it can cause the breading to come off.",
        "Check the recipe to see how long you should cook the food on each side.",
        "Wait until the bottom has browned nicely before flipping it over.",
        "Let the food drain on paper towels while you finish cooking.",
        "While it's best to serve shallowly fried food as soon as possible, you can let it rest for a few minutes while you're finishing up the other batches.",
        "Paper towels will help soak up the excess grease."
