Shaping knit fabric with steam is also useful if you'll be sewing the pieces together, like a sleeve into a sweater, for instance.

It's fine to use lots of pins, especially if you're trying to create straight edges. If you leave big gaps between the pins, it could make the fabric appear scalloped. If you're blocking a piece that you'll be seaming, measure the size the piece should be and pin it according to those dimensions.

Just check to see if you can use it horizontally so water doesn't leak onto the fabric. Try to heat your iron at least 5 minutes before you're ready to block. This way, you won't be waiting on your iron heating up. Always use caution when handling an iron.

        "Spray-Blocking the Fabric Lay the fabric on a towel or blocking board.",
        "You can pull or stretch the fabric until it's the shape you want, but ensure that the fabric is laying flat.",
        "If you're blocking a gauge swatch, remember not to stretch or tug it since you're trying to determine how the fabric reacts to blocking.",
        "You can buy blocking boards or mats online or from craft supply stores.",
        "These are slightly flexible boards that you can push pins into to secure the fabric.",
        "Pin around the edges of the knitted fabric.",
        "Insert pins through the fabric and into the board or towel about every 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the perimeter of your piece.",
        "It's fine to use lots of pins, especially if you're trying to create straight edges.",
        "If you leave big gaps between the pins, it could make the fabric appear scalloped.",
        "If you're blocking a piece that you'll be seaming, measure the size the piece should be and pin it according to those dimensions.",
        "For example, if a panel for a vest should be 6 by 12 inches (15 cm \u00d7 30 cm), stretch the material to that size and pin it in place.",
        "Spray the fabric with cold water until it's soaked.",
        "Fill a spray bottle with cold tap water and spritz the entire surface of the fabric.",
        "Keep spraying until the fabric feels completely wet to the touch.Tip: Keep in mind that this method will take a little longer than wet blocking since you won't wring out the excess water before the fabric dries.",
        "There's no need to flip the fabric over and spray the opposite side.",
        "Dry the fabric for at least 24 hours before you remove the pins.",
        "Leave the wet fabric on the blocking board or towel and let it slowly dry.",
        "The fabric will hold its shape as the water evaporates.",
        "Then, you can take out the pins once the fabric is completely dry.",
        "To encourage drying, run a fan so the air circulates in the room.",
        "Using Steam to Block the Fabric Heat your iron to high.",
        "In order to make steam, pour water into your iron's reservoir.",
        "Then, plug in the iron and turn it to the highest heat setting.",
        "Depending on the type of iron you have, you may have to choose a fabric setting.",
        "In this case, choose cotton to heat the iron to high.Tip: You can also use a handheld fabric steamer to block your knitted fabric.",
        "Just check to see if you can use it horizontally so water doesn't leak onto the fabric.",
        "Try to heat your iron at least 5 minutes before you're ready to block.",
        "This way, you won't be waiting on your iron heating up.",
        "Always use caution when handling an iron.",
        "Unplug the iron as soon as you're finished blocking your pieces and let it cool completely before you store it.",
        "Lay your pieces on a blocking board.",
        "Blocking boards are helpful because they have a grid and you can use the measurements to stretch your fabrics to size.",
        "For example, if you're blocking a blanket that needs to be 3 by 3 feet (91 cm \u00d7 91 cm), line the corners of the blanket on the corner of the board and pull the blanket flat to that size.",
        "If you don't have a blocking board, you can use a padded board that you can easily stick pins into.",
        "Pin the fabric in place on the board.",
        "Take blocking pins and push them into the knitted fabric so they stick into the board.",
        "If you'd like to make sharp corners in your fabric, straighten out and pull the fabric to make a right angle before you insert the pin.Tip: If you're blocking stockinette stitch fabric, flip it over before you pin it.",
        "This will help it lay flat when you go to pin it.",
        "Use plenty of pins so the fabric holds your desired shape.",
        "Hold the hot iron 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the fabric for up to 5 seconds.",
        "Carefully move the hot iron across your knitted fabric without touching the actual iron to the material.",
        "When you hover the iron above the fabric, it will release steam that blocks the material in place.",
        "If the fabric was curled, you should see it relax once you hold the steam over it for about 5 seconds.",
        "Depending on your iron, you may have to press a button to apply steam.",
        "Leave the fabric to cool before you remove the pins.",
        "Since the steam will cool quickly, let the knitted fabric cool for 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Then, pull out the pins once the fabric is dry to the touch.",
        "The blocked fabric should now hold its shape.",
        "If the fabric continues to curl, you may need to block it again or try wet blocking it.",
        "Wetting the Fabric to Block It Fill a sink or bowl with warm water and wool wash. Run warm water into a clean sink or large bowl until it's half full.",
        "Then, pour in wool wash according to the manufacturer's directions.",
        "Keep in mind that you can use wool wash on any type of fabric.",
        "Read the wool wash directions carefully since some washes need to you rinse them.",
        "You can buy wool wash at craft stores, fabric supply stores, or online.",
        "If you can't find wool wash, use gentle fabric detergent that's designed for delicate fabrics.",
        "Soak the fabric in the sink for 30 minutes.",
        "Put your knitted fabric into the solution in the sink and submerge it.",
        "Squeeze the fabric a few times so the wool wash solution gets deep into the fibers.",
        "Then, leave the fabric in the sink for 30 minutes.",
        "You can soak several pieces at the same time.",
        "If you're going to block something large, such as a blanket, you could fill the bathtub or a utility sink with water and the wool wash.",
        "Drain the water and squeeze the fabric.",
        "Use both hands to lift the wet fabric out of the water and ensure that you don't let the wet fabric hang, which could stretch the fibers.",
        "Squeeze the wet fabric between both of your palms so excess water drips into the sink.",
        "You shouldn't wring or twist the fabric since this could stretch or warp the knit.",
        "Arrange the wet fabric on a towel and roll it up.",
        "Lay a clean towel on your work surface or the floor, if you're blocking a large item, and place the wet fabric on it.",
        "Roll the towel over the wet fabric so it's completely wrapped together.",
        "Consider using towels that are designated for blocking since the colors of your fabric might still bleed a little.",
        "Press or squeeze the towel with the rolled up fabric.",
        "Use your hands to squeeze all over the towel so it absorbs the water from the knitted fabric.",
        "If you placed the towel on the floor, you can step on it so it absorbs the water.",
        "Remember to take your socks off and work on a hard floor if you're stepping on the towel.",
        "Spread the wet fabric on a blocking board.",
        "You can spread blankets, scarfs, hats, or swatches so they lay flat on the board.",
        "If you're blocking a garment, you might want to measure the fabric pieces so they fit according to your pattern.",
        "There's no need to pin the fabric in place unless it starts curling up.Did You Know?",
        "You should never pin a gauge swatch since you're blocking it in order to see if the fabric shrinks or expands.",
        "If you're blocking something small like a hat, there's no need to pin it in place.",
        "Dry the fabric for at least 24 hours before you take out the pins.",
        "Although your fabric might feel dry sooner, it's a good idea to leave it for 1 full day so the fibers hold their shape better.",
        "Once the fabric is totally dry, pull out each of the blocking pins.",
        "Consider running a ceiling or room fan to get the air circulating.",
        "To encourage drying, you can flip the fabric over halfway through the drying time."
