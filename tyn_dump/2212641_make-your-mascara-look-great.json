                    "description": "The first step in making your mascara look great is making sure to use the right formula. Mascaras are designed to do different things for your lashes, so if you use a lengthening mascara when you want thicker-looking lashes, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed. Check to make sure that the formula you\u2019re using meets your needs. A lengthening or defining mascara is meant to help your lashes look longer. A volumizing or thickening mascara is meant to help your lashes look thicker. A curling mascara is meant to help lift and bend straight lashes. A tubing mascara contains special polymers that form tubes around your lashes that make them longer and thicker. A fiber mascara contain fiber filaments that adhere to your natural lashes so they appear thicker and longer. Some mascara formulas are designed to lengthen and thicken for an overall improved look for the lashes. If you\u2019re not sure what you want out of mascara, opt for this type of multipurpose formula. Depending on your needs, you may want to use a combination of mascaras in different formulas. For example, you may do a first coat with a volumizing mascara and then add a second coat of a lengthening mascara to separate and define your lashes."

Some brushes feature nylon bristles, while others are made of molded plastic. The shape and layout of the brush affects how the mascara is applied as well. Work with a brush or wand that suits your needs. For thick, fluttery lashes, look for a mascara with a brush that is thick and densely bristled. For long, defined lashes, look for a mascara with a brush that has sparse, short bristles. For the lower lashes, choose a mascara with a small brush head."

Make sure that you have a waterproof eye makeup remover on hand to take it off at the end of the day.
