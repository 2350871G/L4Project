Above the whole number scale on the sleeve are lines that measure to ten-thousandths of an inch; in decimal form it looks like .0001. Read the whole number on the sleeve first. The last visible number will read as the thousandths. For example, if the last number you can see on the sleeve is 5, then it would read 500 thousandths, or .00005. Read how many lines come after the whole number. Look at the individual markings exposed next to the 100 thousandths and multiply each marking by .25.. In this case 1 x .025 would be .025. Find the number and corresponding marking on the thimble scale closest to but underneath the measurement line on the stock. If it's closest to 1, then it would be .001. Add those three numbers together. In this case it would be .500 + .025 + .001 = .526. Flip the micrometer over to read to the 10 thousandths marking.
