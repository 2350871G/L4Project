The bra can be any color, but a skin-toned one would be the best. You can also use something that matches your mermaid costume, such as teal or purple. A strapless bra works best because it has less fabric to peek out from behind the shells. If you can't find one, try to get one with re-moveable straps instead. You can also use a tank top instead of a bra."

If they came from a mermaid costume, you may have to cut the strings connecting them off. Avoid getting abalone shells. They are too heavy for shell tops. If you are getting real shells, make sure that they match up as closely as possible."

For extra sparkle, choose a metallic or pearlescent paint. Let the paint dry before moving on. Keep in mind that most paints will dry a shade or two darker. For an interesting effect: paint the shell a flat color, let it dry, then lightly go over it with a dry brush and a matching metallic color. The paint will stick to just the raised surfaces, giving it a subtle shimmer."

    "text": " Making a Sea Shell Bra Get a strapless bra that fits you. You will be covering this bra with shells, glitter, and other things, so make sure it's one you don't care about. The bra can be any color, but a skin-toned one would be the best. You can also use something that matches your mermaid costume, such as teal or purple. A strapless bra works best because it has less fabric to peek out from behind the shells. If you can't find one, try to get one with re-moveable straps instead. You can also use a tank top instead of a bra. Get two shells big enough to cover your bra. You can find large shells in an arts and crafts store. You can also find large, plastic shells in a party or costume shop. If they came from a mermaid costume, you may have to cut the strings connecting them off. Avoid getting abalone shells. They are too heavy for shell tops. If you are getting real shells, make sure that they match up as closely as possible. Paint the shells with spray paint or acrylic paint, if desired.

Coat the back of the shell with hot glue, then quickly press it against the bra cup. Repeat this step for the other shell and bra cup. You can have the shells pointing straight up-and-down, off to the sides, or at slight, outward angles. You can also use industrial-strength glue, such as E6000.
