If you're only practicing the stitch and not following a pattern, try sewing straight lines of split stitch until you get the hang of it. Then, you can practice split stitching curves. Mount the fabric in an embroidery hoop. Loosen the screw on the hoop to separate the embroidery hoops. Place the inner hoop under the fabric so your traced design is in the center.

If the fabric isn't tight enough in the hoop, it will be harder to make your split stitches. Sewing the Split Stitch Sew a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) straight stitch. Bring the tip of the needle from under the fabric up through the start of the line or pattern you drew. Keep pulling the needle to bring the thread through.

Sew split backstitches across the line or design you traced. Continue to stitch back into the stitch you just made as you work across your design. If you've made these stitches correctly, they should look just like standard split stitches on the front of your fabric. If you turn the embroidery hoop over, you'll see that the split backstitches form a connected line. This is why this stitch uses more embroidery floss than the standard split stitch. Tie a knot at the back of the hoop and cut the thread. Turn the hoop over once you've finished sewing. Tie a tight knot near the underside of the fabric. Then, you can cut the thread and remove the fabric from the hoop.",
