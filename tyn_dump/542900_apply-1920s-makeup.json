The cupid\u2019s bow is a mouth with an exaggerated bottom lip and an upper lip with a bow. To make a cupid\u2019s bow, use a waxy dark red lip liner to draw an arch on each side of your top lip. Then draw your lower lip as slightly plumper than it really is by extending slightly on the bottom. Draw both your upper and bottom lips as shorter on the sides. Fill your new lip shape in with pencil before layering matching lipstick over it. The arches on your top lip should be even, so they look like a bow. Lip colors in the 1920s were deep reds and brownish reds. When you are through, your lips should not be as wide as they really are, giving the illusion that you have them puckered and ready for a kiss.
