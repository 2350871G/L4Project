This is a broad range, so it is likely that any soil that successfully grows other plants in your garden has the correct pH for papaya. If you want more of your seeds to germinate, use sterile potting mix.

        "Inspect the papaya's leaves and bark regularly for signs of disease or insects.",
        "Spots or yellowing on leaves or bark indicate possible disease.",
        "Black spots on the leaf won't typically affect the fruit, but may be treated with fungicide if the infection is severe.",
        "Curling leaves may be a sign of picking up herbicide from a nearby lawn.",
        "Other problems, including insects or full plant collapse, may require consulting an expert gardener or local agricultural department.",
        "Harvest papaya fruits when they reach the level of ripeness you desire.",
        "Tart, green fruits may be eaten as a vegetable, but many people prefer fully ripe, yellow or orange fruits for their sweet taste.",
        "You may harvest anytime after the fruit is mostly yellow-green, if you would like them to finish ripening indoors, away from pests."
