Remove them the same way as the baseboards. Reinstall these components after you finish laying the new underlayment.

You can use a 120-grit piece of sandpaper or flooring edger to wear away high spots in wood floors. If your subfloor is made of concrete, add fresh concrete to the lower areas to fill them in. Another option is to get a thicker subfloor material or self-leveling compound to cover the low areas. Try to level out the floor as much as you can first. Leveling the subfloor is important for keeping the underlayment flat and damage-resistant."

Look there for any other tools you may need to install the underlayment. Switch to cement boards if you're planning on installing tile. Spread mortar on the floor first to place the boards.

Remember to put on a dust mask and safety glasses before mixing the mortar. Check the manufacturer's instructions for the recommended ratio of water to thinset. It can vary between brands, but you usually need about 6 cups (1,400 mL) of water for every 50 lb (23 kg) of mortar. If you're installing underlayment over concrete, consider trying an unmodified thinset mortar instead. You don't need the additive to get it to bond strongly to the existing subfloor."

Fitting Fabric and Rubber Underlayment Rolls Choose a type of underlayment up to \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick. Look for underlayment rated as 2 to 3 mm thick for most projects. Foam is the least expensive option and provides cushioning for all types of flooring. Felt tends to be a little denser than foam and made with recycled material. Rubber resists moisture and sound better than the other types of material, but it's also more expensive. If you're installing underlayment for a roof, stick to asphalt-saturated felt or rubberized asphalt, or a plastic synthetic. Roll the membrane out inside the room. Start in the far corner of the room. Spread the first roll of the membrane material out next to the wall. Continue adding more rolls of the material until the entire floor is covered.

Tackle the exterior borders next, remembering to leave a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) margin between the wall and the underlayment material. Finish by slicing along the outlines you made for pillars and other room obstacles. Work slowly to avoid damaging the underlayment. Although it is easier to cut from the backside, but you don't need to flip it over at all if you're careful. Mix thinset mortar in a bucket until it reaches a spreadable consistency. Thinset mortar is a cement adhesive often used to bind underlayment to cement. Choose a modified thinset mixed with a latex additive, then stir it into a plastic mixing bucket with water. Keep stirring it with a paddle mixer until it looks spreadable like a thick peanut butter. After letting it rest for 10 minutes, mix it a second time. Thinset mortar is available online or at most home improvement stores. Remember to put on a dust mask and safety glasses before mixing the mortar. Check the manufacturer's instructions for the recommended ratio of water to thinset. It can vary between brands, but you usually need about 6 cups (1,400 mL) of water for every 50 lb (23 kg) of mortar. If you're installing underlayment over concrete, consider trying an unmodified thinset mortar instead. You don't need the additive to get it to bond strongly to the existing subfloor. Spread the mortar across the floor with a trowel. Starting on the far end of the room, roll up the underlayment. Add the mortar directly to the subfloor. Move in one direction only, spreading the mortar into a consistent layer no more than \u204416 in (0.48 cm) thick. Fill in the entire exposed floor with mortar. You're better off working on one section of the underlayment at a time. If you try to cover the entire floor, the mortar will get messy and dry out before you get a chance to put the underlayment back in place. Roll the underlayment roll onto the mortar and press it flat. Unroll the underlayment again, making sure it lines up properly with the piece next to it. Once you're sure you have it where you want it, walk over to its center. Push down on it with a clean grout float or another flat tool. Sweep the tool from the center of the underlayment to its ends to press out any wrinkles. To check the membrane's adhesion, you can pull it back and look at the mortar underneath it. Half of the mortar will stay on the floor, but half of it will stick to the underlayment. Continue spreading mortar until the installation is finished. Roll up the underlayment sheets one by one, spreading mortar under each of them. Press them flat after installing them again. You won't need to wait for the mortar to dry before walking on the underlayment. When you're done, mix more mortar as needed to fill in any gaps you notice in the underlayment. Remember to return the additional pieces of underlayment you cut out in order to work around obstacles. If you don't add mortar over the underlayment, you could start installing flooring right away. However, consider waiting a day for the mortar to set.",

        "Always wear a dust mask, safety glasses, and hearing protection when operating a saw.",
        "Don't wear gloves or a long-sleeved shirt that could get caught by the blade.",
        "Before installing the plywood, move the boards into the room to see how they fit.",
