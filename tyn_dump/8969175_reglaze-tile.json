If the refinishing glaze that you are using is opaque, don\u2019t worry too much about matching the replacement tile\u2019s color exactly with the old ones. After all, they will all look the same after the paint coating. Repair small cracks or minor chips by applying a polyester putty to the area and then smoothing it out. This will make the tile waterproof once more and the repairs will be covered up by the refinishing process. Scrape out enough grout and adhesive so the new tiles sit slightly below the existing tile.

Always keep your hands away from the knife\u2019s path and go slowly. This step can get pretty messy, so keep a vacuum close by to suck up the dust and debris. Use a mix of muriatic acid and water to loosen the grout. Only use the acid if you are working in a well-ventilated area and wear a mask and gloves while handling it. You\u2019ll want to replace the grout either before painting or after the epoxy paint has cured. It is really your choice. Grout covered with epoxy paint will be uniform and easier to clean.

Move your hand in small circles or back and forth motions and try to cover all tiles evenly. Rinse off the tiles with water when you are finished. Remember that your goal is to remove any surface bumps and imperfections, not to sand it down to its base. Porcelain tiles need to be prepared with an etching liquid or a pumice block so the glaze will adhere to it. Sanding increases the lifespan of your refinishing job by allowing the epoxy paint to more fully adhered to the surface of your tiles. Don\u2019t get too discouraged if you can\u2019t see clear results from your sanding. Just keep going and rub your hands over the tile\u2019s surface to feel the change in texture."

        "These products make it easier for the epoxy paint to adhere to the surface of the tile.",
        "Some kits come with the necessary primer, but in many cases you\u2019ll have to purchase it separately.",
        "Follow the primer directions carefully to make sure that you apply it correctly.",
        "Some suggest using a sprayer to apply the primer, instead of rolling or brushing it on.",
        "This may prevent some stickiness, but you\u2019ll likely want to practice with the sprayer beforehand, as they can sometimes be difficult to use.",
        "Mix the epoxy together.",
        "Most kits come with two separate paint cans: the activator and the base.",
        "Grab each can and give it a good shake.",
        "Then, slowly pour them together in your paint tray.",
        "If the final mixture looks a little transparent or milky, that is okay.",
        "It will handle a bit like glue and will dry solid, too.",
        "Apply at least two coats of paint or reglazing compound.",
        "Pour the mixed paint into a sprayer or dip a brush into your paint pan.",
        "If you are working with a brush, start with the edges first and work your way in.",
        "You could even brush out the edges and then use a roller for the middle.",
        "After your first coat is finished, give it at least two hour to dry.",
        "Then, apply the next one.",
        "It\u2019s generally best to use a foam roller, as it will leave less of a pattern on the tile.",
        "And, if you use a paint pan, make sure to change out the liner and refresh the paint before applying a second coat.",
        "Otherwise, you may end up with dried paint lumps on your tile.",
        "Spend extra time with any decorative areas.",
        "If your tile has a special border or extra embellishments, expect to go a little bit more slowly on these areas.",
        "You may want to switch to a brush, so that you can get deeper into any indentions or prints.",
        "Take breaks, if needed.",
        "In between various steps, go outside of the room for a few minutes, take off your respirator, and breathe in the fresh air.",
        "If you had to hunch over or lean down while painting, take a quick stretch before going back in.",
        "Give it ample time to dry.",
        "After applying your epoxy paint, you now have to wait for it to cure.",
        "This is the time when the paint hardens to the point where you can get the tile wet without damaging the surface.",
        "Epoxy coatings can dry in 2-3 days, but it is probably safer to leave it alone for a full week.",
        "Hire a professional.",
        "An experienced tile worker or kitchen/bathroom remodeler can offer you some additional options beyond standard refinishing.",
        "For example, some of them can spray on a primer followed by a urethane coating that mimics a glaze when buffed.",
        "Make sure to go with a contractor that you trust and guarantee a competitive price by getting at least two bids.",
        "Tile reglazing fumes are strong and could cause sensitivity if you have allergies or asthma."
