After you\u2019ve taken off as much as you can, place the blade edge of your chisel against the wall 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) above the highest part of the rising damp. Hit the end of your chisel with your hammer to break the wall render apart. Remove all of the area affected by the rising damp down to the floor. The render is the plaster or cement-like material covering your brick wall. If you need to cut through a plaster wall finish, use an angle grinder to cut through it quickly. You do not have to remove the render from your entire room if rising damp is only affecting a portion of the wall."

Repairing the Wall Mix a waterproof mortar in a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket. Choose a 30 lb (14 kg) bag of premixed waterproof mortar from your local home improvement or hardware store. Pour the bag of mortar into the bucket along with 2 US qt (1.9 L) of water and mix it thoroughly with a trowel.

Allow the mortar to set in the holes completely, which should take about 2 days. Make sure to leave the mortar alone during that time so it dries evenly inside the hole. If you used a fast-setting mortar, it may be completely dry within 1 day. Wait 2-4 months before applying a new render. Since your wall was damp, it needs time to dry out. Let the wall completely air dry completely so moisture doesn\u2019t get trapped behind the new render.",
