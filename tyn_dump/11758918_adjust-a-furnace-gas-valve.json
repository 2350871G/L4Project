The control box containing the valve may have some other components on it, such as a labeled pilot light control knob. On a two-stage furnace, one valve is for low pressure and the other is for high pressure. The high-pressure valve doesn\u2019t activate until the furnace gets hot enough.

Start by checking the fuse box or circuit panel in your home to make sure the electricity is on. Once it is on, locate the pilot light switch near the gas valve and turn it off. Wait 5 minutes before activating the pilot light and then relighting it with a long stem lighter. For more information on how to turn on your furnace, check the stickers the manufacturer placed near the front access panel. These stickers will have instructions specific to your furnace model. The pilot light is along the top part of the furnace. Follow the tube leading from the control box to find it. Take your time when relighting a furnace.

        "Note that the optimal setting varies between furnaces, so consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions before making any adjustments.",
        "When you\u2019re ready, go back to the screw on the top or side of the gas valve.",
        "Use a flathead screwdriver to turn the screw.",
        "Rotating it clockwise raises the gas pressure, while rotating it counterclockwise reduces the pressure.",
        "If your furnace only has one pressure valve, you can remove the manometer and cover the outlet port.",
        "For a propane furnace, the valve has to be set to 11 inches of WC or a similar number.",
        "Keep an eye on the manometer, since its display will change as you adjust the valve.",
        "Tune the gas pressure gradually.",
        "For safety, tune it to the pressure rating recommended by the manufacturer.",
        "Altering the Low-Pressure Valve Locate the shorter valve if your furnace has one.",
        "Find the metal box along the middle part of the gas pipe.",
        "The taller valve is the one responsible for the high-pressure setting on a two-stage furnace.",
        "Look for a noticeably shorter valve next to it.",
        "Besides being a little shorter, the low-pressure valve will look almost identical to the high pressure one.",
        "Set the high pressure first, then keep the manometer attached to the outlet port.",
        "Low-pressure valves often have a much shorter screw than high-pressure valves do, so you can use that to tell them apart.",
        "Not all furnaces have both valves.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a two-stage furnace, you won\u2019t have to worry about setting high and low pressures.",
        "The manufacturer\u2019s directions will only have a single recommended pressure listed as well.",
        "Turn the heat down low using the thermostat.",
        "Turn it down as low as it can go.",
        "At a low-temperature setting, your furnace doesn\u2019t need to create as much heat, so the high-pressure valve shuts off.",
        "Watch the manometer\u2019s display, since it will change as it detects the lower pressure.",
        "You will also be able to hear the furnace get quieter as the temperature drops.",
        "You won\u2019t have to disconnect the manometer at all.",
        "Leave it connected to the outlet valve near the pipe.",
        "Adjust the low-pressure valve to 1.6 WC for natural gas.",
        "Check the pressure setting recommended by the manufacturer.",
        "When you have it, slip a flathead screwdriver into the valve.",
        "Turn it clockwise to raise the pressure and counterclockwise to lower it.",
        "Once it\u2019s at the recommended setting, your furnace will be in working order again.",
        "The proper pressure can vary from furnace to furnace.",
        "For instance, on a propane furnace, it will be around 4.0 inches of WC.",
        "Mixing up the high and low-pressure settings is easy, so double-check the instructional sticker near the access panel.",
        "Make sure you\u2019re using the \u201chigh fire\u201d number for the high-pressure valve and the \u201clow fire\u201d number for the low-pressure valve.",
        "Remove the manometer and close up the furnace.",
        "Unscrew the adapter from the pressure valve outlet, then return the outlet plug.",
        "Hang the front access panel on the furnace next.",
        "If it had screws, put them back and turn them clockwise to secure it in place.",
        "If you are sure the gas pressure is correct but are still experiencing problems with the furnace, contact a heating and cooling specialist."
