    "text": " Making a Deluxe Burp Cloth Choose your fabric. Pick some absorbent fabric for the body of the burp cloth, such as terry, minky, or flannel. Next, pick some patterned cotton fabric for the center strip. It can be baby or nursery-themed, or just something you find pretty. Wash, dry, and iron your fabric. Avoid using dryer sheets when drying your fabric, as they may make your fabric less-absorbent. Don't cut your fabric first; it may end up shrinking by quite a bit! Cut your fabric. Cut the absorbent fabric into a 12 by 16-inch (30.48 by 40.64-centimeter) rectangle. Cut the patterned fabric into a 5 by 16-inch (12.7 by 40.64-centimeter) strip. Set the absorbent fabric aside for now. Fold the long edges of the patterned fabric in by \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter), then press them flat with an iron. Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the long edges down by \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeters), and secure them with sewing pins. Press the edges flat with an iron, then remove the sewing pins. Pin the patterned fabric, right-side-up, on top of the absorbent fabric. Make sure that the patterned fabric is centered, and that the narrow edges are aligned with the narrow edges of the absorbent fabric. Once you are happy with the placement, pin the fabric in place. Sew the long edges of the patterned fabric down, as close to the edge as you can. Use a thread color that matches your patterned fabric, and a bobbin color that matches your absorbent fabric. Pull the pins put as you go. Cut a 60-inch (152.4-centimeter) long piece of 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide ribbon. This will longer than you actually need to wrap around the edges of your burp cloth, but it's better to have something be too long than too short. Remember, it is always easier to cut down something that is too long than to add length to something that is too short! You can also use \u00bd-inch (0.27-centimeter) double-fold bias tape instead. Fold the end of the ribbon under by \u00bd-inch (0.27 centimeters), then wrap it around the edges of the burp cloth. Wrap the sides of the ribbon tape over the edges of the burp cloth, so that it looks the same on both sides. Pin the ribbon in place as you go. If you are using bias tape: Open up the bias tape first, then fold the end under by \u00bd inch (0.27 centimeters). After that, wrap it around the burp cloth, tucking the edges of the cloth into the fold of the bias tape. Topstitch the ribbon down. Try to get as close to the inner edge as you can, and remove the pins as you go. To prevent the thread from unraveling, backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing. Making a Striped Burp Cloth Get a pre-folded cloth diaper and some patterned, cotton fabric. Your patterned fabric can be anything you want it to be. It can be baby-themed, or nursery-themed, or simply something that you find pretty. Wash, dry, and iron the diaper and the cotton fabric. This will remove any shrinking and starches. When drying your fabric, avoid using dryer sheets, as they may reduce the absorbency. Lastly, be sure to iron your fabric. This will help stretch it back out as well as remove any wrinkles. Cut your patterned fabric 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) wide and 2\u00bd-inch (6.35 centimeters) longer than your diaper. This will be long enough to wrap over the front of your diaper, with extra space for the hems. Fold the long edges down by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters). Take your fabric strip, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the long edges down by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters), and press them flat with an iron. Fold both of the narrow edges down by \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeters). With the wrong side of the fabric still facing you, fold both of the narrow edges down by \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeters). Press them flat with an iron. Pin the fabric strip down the center of your diaper, with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) hanging off either side. Turn your diaper so that one of the narrow edges is facing you. Place the fabric strip down on top of it and center it. Make sure that both ends of the fabric strip are hanging over the edges of your diaper by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Once you are happy with the placement, pin the fabric strip in place. Don't worry about folding the ends of your fabric strip down just yet. You will do that later. Topstitch the fabric strip down, as close to the side edges as you can. A good way to do this would be to position the edge of your strip so that it aligns with the center of your presser foot, then shifting the needle off to the side, so that it catches onto the fabric. Topstitch first one side, then the other. Remove the pins as you sew. Use a thread color that matches your patterned fabric, and a bobbin color that matches your diaper. Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of you sewing, so that the stitching doesn't come undone. Turn the diaper over, then fold the ends of the fabric strip over the top and bottom edges. You will have a hem that is between \u00bd and 1 inch (1.27 and 2.54 centimeters) thick, depending on the bulk of your diaper. Secure the hem down with sewing pins. Topstitch the hem down, as close to the side edge as you can. Be sure to switch out the bobbin thread so that it matches the patterned fabric. Backstitch as the start and end of your sewing, and remove the pins as you go. Making a Simple Burp Cloth Get some pre-folded cloth diapers and patterned, cotton fabric. Choose a pretty color for the fabric. It can be baby or nursery-themed, or something that you find pretty. If you can't find any pre-folded cloth diapers, you can use another type of absorbent fabric, such as terry cloth, minky fabric, or flannel. Cut it down to 11 by 16 inches (27.94 by 40.64 centimeters). Wash, dry, and iron the diapers and fabric. Do not use dryer sheets; some people find that they reduce the fabrics' absorbency. Once the diapers and cotton fabric is dry, iron them out. They will have shrunk a little in the wash, but the ironing will help length and smooth them out again. Pin the diaper to the right side of the fabric. If the fabric is much later than the diaper, trim it down until the edges align. Sew along the edges of the diaper using a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a 3 to 4-inch (7.62 to 10.16-centimeter) gap along one of the edges so that you can turn the fabric. Remove the sewing pins as you sew. If you are making your burp cloth from scratch using you own fabric, use a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance instead.

        "It can be baby-themed, or nursery-themed, or simply something that you find pretty.",
        "Wash, dry, and iron the diaper and the cotton fabric.",
        "This will remove any shrinking and starches.",
        "When drying your fabric, avoid using dryer sheets, as they may reduce the absorbency.",
        "Lastly, be sure to iron your fabric.",
        "This will help stretch it back out as well as remove any wrinkles.",
        "Cut your patterned fabric 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) wide and 2\u00bd-inch (6.35 centimeters) longer than your diaper.",
        "This will be long enough to wrap over the front of your diaper, with extra space for the hems.",

        "Once you are happy with the placement, pin the fabric strip in place.",
        "Don't worry about folding the ends of your fabric strip down just yet.",
        "You will do that later.",
        "Topstitch the fabric strip down, as close to the side edges as you can.",
        "A good way to do this would be to position the edge of your strip so that it aligns with the center of your presser foot, then shifting the needle off to the side, so that it catches onto the fabric.",
        "Topstitch first one side, then the other.",
        "Remove the pins as you sew.",
        "Use a thread color that matches your patterned fabric, and a bobbin color that matches your diaper.",

        "It can be baby or nursery-themed, or something that you find pretty.",
        "If you can't find any pre-folded cloth diapers, you can use another type of absorbent fabric, such as terry cloth, minky fabric, or flannel.",
        "Cut it down to 11 by 16 inches (27.94 by 40.64 centimeters).",
        "Wash, dry, and iron the diapers and fabric.",
        "Do not use dryer sheets; some people find that they reduce the fabrics' absorbency.",
        "Once the diapers and cotton fabric is dry, iron them out.",
        "They will have shrunk a little in the wash, but the ironing will help length and smooth them out again.",
        "Pin the diaper to the right side of the fabric.",
        "If the fabric is much later than the diaper, trim it down until the edges align.",
        "Sew along the edges of the diaper using a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.",

        "Pull the tape off when you are done sewing.",
        "Clip the corners, then turn the fabric inside out.",
        "Snip the corners as close as you can to the stitching without actually cutting through the thread.",
        "This will help reduce the bulk.",
        "Use a chopstick, knitting needle, or some other blunt, pointy tool to help turn and shape the corners.",
        "Press the burp cloth flat with an iron.",
        "Be sure to tuck any excess fabric into the gap first, so that the edges are neat and even.",
        "If you need to, keep the edge down with sewing pins.",
        "Topstitch around the edge of the burp cloth.",

        "Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to keep the thread from coming undone.",
        "If you make your burp cloth using your own fabric, you can skip this step.",
        "You can also simply topstitch two vertical lines down the center of your burp cloth, about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) away from the long edges."
