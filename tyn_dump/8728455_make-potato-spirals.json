This will keep them from burning in the oven. Once they are soaked, take them out, pat them dry, and rub some cooking oil onto them. This will make it easier to form the potato spirals. Cut and skewer the potatoes. Cut one of the narrow ends off of a potato. Place it cut-side-down onto the cutting board. Push a skewer down through the other narrow end. Slide the potato onto the center of the skewer when you are done. Repeat this step for the other skewers and potatoes. Cut the potatoes around the skewer. Set the skewered potato down in front of you, oriented horizontally. Cut straight down into the right end of the potato; make sure that the tip of the knife is angled to the left. Start turning the skewer towards you as you cut the potato in a spiral. Gently stretch the potatoes. Wrap your hand around the right end of the potato. Gently pull your hand across the potato towards the other end. You may have to do this a few times until you get the trademark corkscrew shape. Set the skewered potatoes onto a deep baking dish. The dish needs to be narrow enough so that you can set the skewers over the edges. It also needs to be deep enough so that the potatoes don't touch the bottom.
