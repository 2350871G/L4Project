If there is pus coming out of your wound or it won\u2019t stop bleeding after 2-3 minutes, go to the emergency room.Warning: It\u2019s extremely important that you go to the doctor as soon as possible if there\u2019s pus coming out of your wound, it won\u2019t stop bleeding, or the cut is deep. The cut could get infected, or you may have cut an artery and require immediate medical attention. If the cut isn\u2019t very deep or long, you\u2019re fine to treat it on its own.
