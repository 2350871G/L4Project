The largest of the common factors is the greatest common factor (GCF) that will be used to continue solving the problem. In our example, 8 and 12 share the factors 1, 2, and 4. The greatest common factor is 4. Multiply the denominators together. In order to use the greatest common factor to solve the problem, you must first multiply the two denominators together.

        "Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, and 8\nFactors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 Identify the greatest common factor between both denominators.",
        "Once you have listed the factors of each denominator, circle all of the common factors.",
        "The largest of the common factors is the greatest common factor (GCF) that will be used to continue solving the problem.",
        "In our example, 8 and 12 share the factors 1, 2, and 4.",
        "The greatest common factor is 4.",
        "Multiply the denominators together.",
        "In order to use the greatest common factor to solve the problem, you must first multiply the two denominators together.",
        "Continuing our example: 8 * 12 = 96 Divide this product by the GCF.",
        "After finding the product of the two denominators, divide that product by the GCF you found previously.",
        "This number will be your least common denominator (LCD).",
        "Example: 96 / 4 = 24 Divide the LCD by the original denominator.",
        "To determine the multiple needed to make the denominators equal, divide the LCD you determined by the original denominator.",
        "Multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by this number.",
        "The denominators should now both be equal to the LCD.",
        "Example: 24 / 8 = 3; 24 / 12 = 2\n(3/3) * (3/8) = 9/24; (2/2) * (5/12) = 10/24\n9/24 + 10/24 Solve the rewritten equation.",
        "With the LCD found, you should be able to add and subtract the fractions in the equation without further difficulty.",
        "Remember to simplify the fraction at the end, if possible.",

        "Factor each denominator digit into a series of prime numbers that multiply together to make that number.",
        "Prime numbers are numbers that cannot be divided by any other number.",

        "Example: There are two 2\u2019s in 4; zero 2\u2019s in 5; two 2\u2019s in 12\nThere are zero 3\u2019s in 4 and 5; one 3 in 12\nThere are zero 5\u2019s in 4 and 12; one 5 in 5 Take the largest count for each prime.",
        "Identify the largest number of times you used each prime number for any of the denominators and note that count.",
        "Example: The largest count of 2 is two; the largest of 3 is one; the largest of 5 is one Write that prime as many times as you counted in the previous step.",
        "Do not write out the number of times each prime number appeared throughout all the original denominators.",
        "Only write out the largest count, as determined in the previous step.",
        "Example: 2, 2, 3, 5 Multiply all the prime numbers written in this manner.",
        "Multiply the prime numbers together as they appeared in the previous step.",
        "The product of these numbers equals the LCD for the original equation.",
        "Example: 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 60\nLCD = 60 Divide the LCD by the original denominator.",
        "To determine the multiple needed to make the denominators equal, divide the LCD you determined by the original denominator.",
        "Multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by this number.",

        "Example: 60/4 = 15; 60/5 = 12; 60/12 = 5\n15 * (1/4) = 15/60; 12 * (1/5) = 12/60; 5 * (1/12) = 5/60\n15/60 + 12/60 + 5/60 Solve the rewritten equation.",
        "With the LCD found, you should be able to add and subtract the fractions as usual.",

        "Implement any of the methods used for finding the LCD of common fractions, as explained in the previous method sections.",
        "Note that for this example, we will be using the \u201clisting multiples\u201d method, in which a list of multiples is created for each denominator and the LCD is identified from these lists.",
        "Note that you do not need to create a list of multiples for 1 since any number multiplied by 1 equals itself; in other words, every number is a multiple of 1.",
        "Example: 4 * 1 = 4; 4 * 2 = 8; 4 * 3 = 12; 4 * 4 = 16; etc.",

        "The LCD = 12 Rewrite the original equation.",
        "Instead of multiplying the denominator alone, you must multiply the entire fraction by the digit required for changing the original denominator into the LCD.",
        "Example: (12/12) * (8/1) = 96/12; (3/3) * (9/4) = 27/12; (4/4) * (2/3) = 8/12\n96/12 + 27/12 + 8/12 Solve the equation.",
