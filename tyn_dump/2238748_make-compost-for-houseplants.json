Small metal garbage cans are ideal for this, as are plastic storage bins with lids. Select a location for your indoor composting. You will want to keep your compost bin close to the kitchen, as this will prevent you from having to trek across your home with your vegetable scraps. Placing the bin under your kitchen sink is an option, but a more attractive compost container could be prominently displayed as part of your d\u00e9cor. Drill holes into your container.

Finally, you'll need to position the bin on top of a shallow pan or tray that will collect any excess water that drips out of the holes in the container's bottom.
