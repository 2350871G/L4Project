Take a citrus-based household degreaser and spray the pages until the colors start to run and blend together. The more degreaser you spray on the pages, the more the colors will run and the more abstract the image will appear. If you want to keep a bit of the image coherent, just spray the page once or twice and allow that to dry before spraying any more.

    "text": " Creating a Collage Choose a base material. Your mixed media base can be any flat surface; many people use either blank canvases or pieces of flat wood. You could also use a journal or notebook to make a personalized jacket for your journal. Your base material can be any size or shape that you want \u2013 just be sure it has a flat surface. Collect thin paper with text or images to use in your background. You have many options here for what to use: old paper from your printer with text on it, sheet music, pages from the phone book, newspaper pages, thin magazine pages, children\u2019s book pages, and patterned tissue paper are just a few. Start a collection by going through old books and newspapers and pulling out pages you may want to use in the future. If you have a space for working on art, create a space for your paper collection and organize it according to type. Add color and texture to your paper with watered-down paint.

Cover your work area with a drop cloth to avoid getting degreaser on any surfaces you don\u2019t want sprayed. Allow your pages to dry for 15-20 minutes. Adhere your background papers to your canvas with decoupage. Plan out how you want your background to look and start cutting or ripping pieces of background paper.

To finalize your collage and make sure all your layers are secure, brush a thin layer of decoupage over the finished design. Allow this layer to dry for a few hours and you\u2019re ready to display your piece! Combining Pencil and Watercolor Print a black and white photo you\u2019d like to draw on regular printer paper. Print a black and white photo of a person, animal, building you like, or landscape on regular printer paper. Any image that you like will work. You will use this photo as a reference to recreate it as a pencil and watercolor piece. You don\u2019t need to use an originally black and white image. Just make sure the printed-out version is in black and white. Instead of printing from a computer, use an image in a photography book and make a black and white photocopy of it. Photocopiers can be found at many libraries and office supply stores. If you\u2019re experienced in drawing and want to use your own personal drawing, you can skip this step and make your drawing in graphite on a piece of watercolor paper. Then skip down to the step about filling in your drawing with colored pencil. Flip the paper over and cover the image with graphite scribbles. On the back of the printed photo, cover the paper in graphite using a soft 6B or 8B graphite pencil. You want to get a nice layer of graphite all over the parts of the image that you\u2019ll be using in your drawing. Start with a sharpened pencil while scribbling, and allow the point to get dull. Sharpen your pencil again if it becomes so dull you can no longer use it. Turn the paper back over and clip it to your watercolor paper. When you\u2019ve covered the back of the print-out in graphite, flip the paper over and clip it, front side up, to a similarly sized piece of watercolor paper. Be sure that the image is securely in place so that it doesn\u2019t slide around when you\u2019re tracing it. Use multiple clips or tape on every side to make sure the image is secured to the watercolor paper and won\u2019t move around. Use a ballpoint pen to trace your image. On your image print-out, trace major lines and smaller details directly onto the image with ballpoint pen. Do not color anything in; simply trace the details. The pressure from the pen will transfer graphite lines onto your piece of watercolor paper behind the image. You can make a few extra lines to denote important shadows from your image, but the actual shadowing will come later. Remove the image print-out from the watercolor paper. When you have finished fully tracing the image in detail, remove the print-out from the watercolor paper. You should have a good traced sketch of the image on your watercolor paper now. If there are any parts missing or ones that are too light, add more graphite scribbles to the back of your print-out and trace it onto the watercolor paper again. Fill in the image with colored pencil starting with the darkest parts. Using your print-out for reference, shade the darkest parts of the image on your watercolor paper with black or sepia colored pencil. Coloring the darkest parts first will help you transform the outline of the image into a version that looks more and more like the actual image. Next shade the lighter parts of the image using a warm grey colored pencil. Mix some watercolors with water. Choose colors that you would like to use on your piece. If the original image was in color, you can use these colors as a reference point, or make your piece have totally different colors. It\u2019s entirely up to you. Mix your paints with plenty of water so that the colors are nice and light. Apply watercolor to various parts of your pencil drawing however you like. Using your light, watered-down colors and a small paintbrush, begin adding color to details of your drawing. Some people like to keep the color in their pieces at a minimum, while others like their image to be more drenched in color. Allow your colors to dry for half an hour before moving on to the next step. After you\u2019ve painted parts of your image in the very watered-down colors, you can add more bright highlights with less-watered down colors according to your preference. Use black watercolor to highlight details and shadows. To go over some of the darkest areas of your piece, dip a clean paintbrush into water and add just 1 drop of water to some black watercolor. This will give you the densest black to add to the dark areas of your image. When you\u2019ve filled in the darkest areas, lighten the black watercolor to grey by adding more water. Use the greyish watercolor to fill in lighter shadows on your image. Allow your watercolors to dry for half an hour. Add texture with colored pencil to finalize the piece. Let your watercolors dry for at least a half an hour. When the paint is dry, use your colored pencils to add more texture to your piece. If your image is an animal, pencils are especially useful in creating fur. Use your pencils to add subtle details to your piece such as blades of grass, lines on leaves, texture of brick or stone on a building, or hair on people. If you think your piece doesn\u2019t have enough watercolor, you can always go back and add more. Just finalize the piece with pencils as your last step. Embellishing Photographs Choose some photographs to alter. Many people like using old photos for this project, but you can use any photo you want. Look for old photos at thrift stores, antique stores, or garage sales, or choose photos from your own collection. If you\u2019re using a photo that\u2019s important to you and you\u2019re afraid of messing up, make a paper photocopy of the photo to try out your ideas before permanently changing the photograph. Try watercolor on a black and white photo to make it pop. Mix some watercolors with a small amount of water so that they\u2019re nice and bright. Apply color carefully to the lighter or white parts of a black and white photo in any way that you want. Don\u2019t be afraid to make the colors weird if that\u2019s what you want to do. Make people have green skin, make the sky red, etc. Add shapes, designs, or text in ink on a photo to create a brand new image. Use colored or black ink to modify your photo by adding shapes, designs, or words. Black ink drawings look nice over colored photos, while colored ink looks great on black and white, sepia, or monochrome photos. Try giving people word bubbles like in comics, or add stars over their eyes. Or add to the background of a photo with lots of different shapes and designs. Change the colors and details of a photograph with paint pens, pastels, or acrylics. Take any colored photograph and change the colors by outlining a part of it in a different color of paint pen, pastel, or acrylic paint. Or use black and white photos to add color. Add shapes and designs in any way that you like with your paint, paint pen, or pastel to change the original photo as much as you like. Add glitter, newspaper clippings, or pressed flowers to make your photos 3D. Similar to collage, you can glue a variety of objects on top of any photograph to add embellishments. You can do this in conjunction with changing the photos with painting or drawing, or do this on its own. Remember \u2013 your only limit is your own imagination.",
