Salt stains mar the look of boots and weaken the fabric. If there are metallic parts to your boots (zippers, hooks, etc. ), these will begin to rust if the salt is not removed. For the best results, always clean off any salt stain as soon as you spot it. Use the cleaning agent recommended by your boots' manufacturer (desalting agent). Still wet salt lines can be quickly fixed by wiping over the leather boot with a damp, warm cloth. Leave to dry in the mudroom (not near a heater). To retain the shape of the boot if it's not able to do so on it's own, stuff with newspaper or other scrap paper. Dried-on salt lines can be removed with commercial products or you can make your own easily (for leather boots). Combine equal parts of vinegar and water to make a liquid solution. Dip a cleaning rag into the solution, then wipe around the salt line. To finish, use a clean damp cloth to wipe off the solution and any remaining salt line. Wipe with a dry towel, then leave to dry away from direct heat. When dry, buff. (This method is not suitable for suede boots.) For suede boots, clean marks off with an eraser or sand gently with an emery board. To restore flattened nap, use a clean toothbrush or towel to brush it up or steam gently over the spout of a just boiled kettle."
