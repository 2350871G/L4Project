While you can brew a quick cup of tea in the microwave (pour water into a ceramic cup and heat for two minutes until boiling, then add your teabag), you can make the process even easier:\nPurchase an electric teakettle. Electric teakettles are readily available at many bath and kitchen stores, ranging in price and are extremely easy to use. All you have to do is fill it with water and push a button or lever to bring it to a boil. You can brew tea by the cup or add several tea bags to the entire pot once the water has boiled. Keep a thermos as well for the additional boiled water. Fill with water, add the green tea and keep by the kettle or your desk for ease of pouring a tea when needed. Buy an iced tea maker. During warmer months, drinking hot tea may not sound like fun; however, you can still consume just as much tea by using an iced tea maker. Like the electric teakettle, simply fill the machine with water; add ice (according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions) and teabags. Turn it on and begin drinking fresh iced tea in a matter of minutes. Brew iced tea the night before for quick access during the day. If you don\u2019t have a few minutes to brew your iced tea that day, make it at night and keep a pitcher of tea in your refrigerator.

Time it right. Some experts believe that certain teas should be consumed at different times of day to reap maximum weight loss results. While drinking tea at all is good, consider drinking different kinds throughout the day to see what works for you. White tea may block fat absorption, so drink it before lunch. A tea like bilberry can balance your glucose levels, so it's most useful around dinnertime. Pu-erh, green, and oolong teas can get your metabolism going, so drink them in the morning (and throughout the day! ). Drink it on the go. Too much of life these days is spent in some sort of commute. Make it more enjoyable by turning it into a chance to sit down and drink tea! Have a thermos (or two) at your disposal anytime to make it super convenient. Prepare tea well in advance for the time crunch of your day. Basically, the theme of this article is drink, drink, drink. Not only will you not have the chance to put something else in your stomach, but you won't want to -- the more you drink, the fuller you'll feel. Think about your caffeine intake. Certain teas have caffeine in them -- sure, not like a cup of coffee does, but if you're drinking it 24/7, it adds up! While caffeine is not technically dehydrating, it does have about 50 mg of caffeine per cup. You don't want to exceed 300 mg, if you can avoid it. If you react poorly to caffeine, stick to herbal teas that don't have caffeine. While this won't be an issue for most people, some are particularly caffeine sensitive and high levels of caffeine can lead to insomnia, nervousness, and prolonged symptoms even hours and hours later. Staying Mo-tea-vated Balance your tea habits with a healthy diet. Let's get real here for a second: If you don't see results with a new diet fairly quickly, you're not going to stick with it. While drinking tea is a great idea, you'll get faster results if you have a healthy diet, too. The two combined will make you a force to be reckoned with! You know what tea goes great with? Whole grains, fruits, veggies, and low-fat dairy products. Since you're brewing your own tea, why not cook your own food while you're at it? Cutting out processed goods and making everything yourself means you know every little thing you're putting in your body. Avoid getting bored. Your taste buds may get tired of drinking just one type of tea. Would you want to eat only one food for every meal? In order to stick to your routine, mix it up and try different teas, flavors and enhancements. It can be a lot of fun making a tea selection in your home or office cupboard, allowing you to choose a tea flavor according to the mood you're in. Add honey or rock candy sticks to your tea. Keep in mind though that doing this will go against your initiative to lose weight \u2013\u2013 but a little honey or sweetness may make the tea taste better. Perhaps as an occasional treat, this one won't hurt. Try a splash of fat free flavored cream or a squirt of lemon for a zestier tea. A slice of lemon can help improve the flavor. Plus, one study found that those who drink black tea with lemon peel have 70 percent reduced likelihood of developing skin cancer. Explore new tea flavors. The sky is the limit when it comes to trying different flavored teas.There are many brands and many sources of tea, and it's unlikely you'll ever taste them all. Learning about new tea varieties, flavors and styles is a lot of fun for the tea enthusiast. Here are some more interesting teas to consider, all of which claim to promote weight loss:Star anise tea: promotes digestion and can actually soothe an upset tummy\nPeppermint tea: controls appetite and speeds up digestion\nRose tea: prevents constipation and contains loads of vitamins\nPu-erh (poo-air) tea: shrinks fat cells (so drink it in the morning)\nChickweed tea: reduces bloating and is a mild diuretic (stick to one cup)\n\nIn order to stay true to your diet. only select tea you have to brew yourself instead of a pre-made tea. Some of the pre-made coffees and teas have a tremendous amount of sugar \u2013\u2013 not diet friendly. Drink tea mindfully. Dieting is often about overcoming your mind's tendency to crave and to feel deprived. Mindfulness can help to restore conscious eating habits and can help you to remain calm and in control about your food choices. Even if you're not craving tea, try keeping it around to fight off those temptations. See these tea ritual articles for more ideas. People have been drinking it for thousands of years for a reason! See How to meditate while drinking tea for more information. Tea and meditation? Have you ever uttered the words, \"I almost feel too relaxed?\" Well, you're about to. Know your stuff. According to a study by Abdul Dulloo, from the Institute of Physiology at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, the plant compound EGCG found in green tea, plus caffeine, increases thermogenesis by 84 percent. Thermogenesis is the generation of body heat that occurs as a result of normal digestion, absorption, and metabolization of food. Green tea also increases your levels of norepinephrine, which prepares your body to burn fat for the \"fight or flight\" response. Knowledge is power, people! It's also motivation! While not every researcher believes that green (or other) tea drinking is a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d for weight loss, every weight loss expert would agree that flooding your system with water or drinking tea versus eating a candy bar or drinking soda can help move the digestion process along quickly and perhaps distract you from munching snacks that aren't healthy. Regardless of whether it's magical or not, it's a good idea.",
