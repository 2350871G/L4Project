                    "description": "Choose a stiff fabric, such a felt, wool, linen, faux leather, or quilted cotton. This will create a bow tie that is about 4.5 by 3 in (11.4 by 7.6 cm). Measure and mark the fabric with a ruler and some chalk or a pen. Then, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut your fabric. If you want a larger bow tie, cut a larger rectangle of fabric. Use a 3 to 1 ratio for length and width and make the length twice the desired length of the finished bow tie. For example, if you want your bow tie to be 6 by 4 in (15 by 10 cm), then cut out a fabric rectangle that is 12 by 4 in (30 by 10 cm)."

                    "description": "This length will work for most size bow ties because you only need to wrap it around the center of the bow tie. For a bow tie that is larger than 4.5 by 3 in (11.4 by 7.6 cm), start with these dimensions as a base. Then, add 1 in (2.5 cm) to the length and 0.5 in (1.3 cm) to the width. For example, if you are making a bow tie that is 6 by 4 in (15 by 10 cm), then you might cut a strip of fabric that is 1.5 by 4 in (3.8 by 10.2 cm). Remember that you can always trim the strip down to suit your tie, but you cannot add fabric back on."

    "text": " Making a Quick No-Sew Bow Tie Cut out a 9 by 3 in (22.9 by 7.6 cm) rectangle of stiff fabric. Choose a stiff fabric, such a felt, wool, linen, faux leather, or quilted cotton. This will create a bow tie that is about 4.5 by 3 in (11.4 by 7.6 cm). Measure and mark the fabric with a ruler and some chalk or a pen. Then, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut your fabric. If you want a larger bow tie, cut a larger rectangle of fabric. Use a 3 to 1 ratio for length and width and make the length twice the desired length of the finished bow tie. For example, if you want your bow tie to be 6 by 4 in (15 by 10 cm), then cut out a fabric rectangle that is 12 by 4 in (30 by 10 cm). Cut a 3 by 1 in (7.6 by 2.5 cm) strip of fabric for the center of the bow. This length will work for most size bow ties because you only need to wrap it around the center of the bow tie. For a bow tie that is larger than 4.5 by 3 in (11.4 by 7.6 cm), start with these dimensions as a base. Then, add 1 in (2.5 cm) to the length and 0.5 in (1.3 cm) to the width. For example, if you are making a bow tie that is 6 by 4 in (15 by 10 cm), then you might cut a strip of fabric that is 1.5 by 4 in (3.8 by 10.2 cm). Remember that you can always trim the strip down to suit your tie, but you cannot add fabric back on. Fold the rectangle in half so that the short edges are lined up. Lay the rectangle out on a flat surface, and then fold 1 end of the rectangle over to the opposite end. Line up the edges of the rectangle and hold it in this position with 1 hand. You can also place a weight on the tie to keep it folded if you need to do something else before continuing. However, do not use pins. They may damage the fabric and you will not be able to complete the bow tie with a pin in place. Squeeze in the bow at the center. With your other hand, pick up the rectangle at the center and squeeze it in to create 3 even folds. The center should look like an accordion when you do this. There should be 3 distinct, even folds in the center of the tie. Keep holding the tie at the center with 1 hand to keep it folded. Glue the bow between the folds with a hot glue gun. Heat up the hot glue gun about 15 minutes before you plan to use it. When the glue gun is warmed up, loosen your grip on the center of the tie slightly to expose the area between the folds. Then, apply a dot of hot glue between the folds. Continue to apply dots of hot glue into the areas between the folds to secure the center of the bow tie. Secure the strip of fabric around the center of the bow with hot glue. Take the strip of fabric and wrap it so that the short ends overlap on the back side of the bow tie. Then, apply a couple of dots of hot glue to the fabric to secure the 2 ends to the back of the bow tie and to each other. If needed, you can cut off some of the excess material to get a better fit. This completes your bow tie! Attach it to your shirt collar with a safety pin through the backside of the bow tie. Sewing an Adult Bow Tie Choose a flexible print or color fabric for your bow tie. Cotton works well for making a bow tie, but you can use any fabric you like as long as it is flexible enough to shape into a bow tie. Choose something in the color, texture, and weight of your choice. You will need about \u00bc of a yard of fabric and \u00bc of a yard of iron-on interfacing. Purchase fabric from an online fabric store or a local craft store. You can also upcycle unwanted clothing from your own closet, such as an old, cotton dress shirt or skirt. Find and print a simple bow tie pattern. You can purchase a pattern from a craft store or download and print a free pattern from the internet. Read reviews of the pattern to assess its quality. Also, make sure the pattern is equal to your skill level. The pattern you use will look like a long strip with a couple of wider, rounded spots after you cut it out. This will allow you to create a bow tie that you can actually tie, rather than a clip-on tie. If you cannot find a tie pattern you want to use, then you can also use an existing tie to create a pattern. Place the untied fabric on a sheet of construction paper. Then, use a pen or pencil to trace the outline of the tie onto the paper. Trace around the edges of the tie leaving 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of extra space all around the edges of the tie. This will be your seam allowance. Cut the fabric and interfacing for your bow tie shape. Place the pattern piece on your folded fabric and insert a few pins through the pattern and fabric layers to secure them. Cut the fabric right along the outer edges of the pattern. Do not cut through the pattern or too far outside of the edges. Then, repeat this with the pattern piece on the folded interfacing. You should end up with 4 pieces of fabric that are the same size and shape. Iron the interfacing onto the fabric. Lay out 1 of your fabric bow tie pieces so that the wrong (back) side of the fabric is facing up. Then, place 1 of the interfacing pieces over the fabric piece. Line up the edges of the interfacing and fabric so that they are even. Run the heated iron over the interfacing to secure it to the fabric. Repeat this for the other fabric and interfacing pieces. Sew the long edges of the 2 interfaced fabric pieces together. Line up the 2 pieces so that the right sides are facing each other and the edges are aligned. Sew a straight stitch about 0.15 in (0.38 cm) from the raw edges on both of the long sides of the tie, but leave a 3 in (7.6 cm) opening in 1 side near the center part of the tie. Sew around the short end on 1 side of the tie as well. You will invert the pieces after sewing them together. Snip the excess fabric at the corners of the tie and along the curved edges. Before you turn the tie inside out, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the excess fabric at the corners of the bow tie. Then, snip notches into the fabric along the curved part of the tie. This will make it easier to push the fabric out on the inside of the tie. Make sure that you do not cut through the stitches you have made. Flip the inside of the bow tie out. This can take a little patience, as it can be difficult to pull the whole tie through the small opening you have left in the tie. Use your fingers to push the material through the opening in the center of the tie. To make it easier, try using the eraser end of a pencil to help you push 1 end of the tie through the opening in the tie and out the other side. Sew the remaining short edge of the tie. On the remaining open part of the tie, flip the raw edges inward by about 0.25 in (0.64 cm). Sew a straight stitch about 0.15 in (0.38 cm) from the folded edge, or use a needle and thread to hand sew the opening closed. This will secure the open end of the bow tie. If desired, you may also sew a straight stitch across the other short end of the tie so that the ends of the tie match each other. Iron your bow tie. Ironing will make the tie look neat and crisp after it is tied. Place the bow tie on a flat surface, such as an ironing board or over a towel on a table or counter. Then, run the heated iron over the fabric to flatten it out, especially along the seams. Make sure that the tie is free of bumps, creases, and wrinkles when you are finished. If your tie is made from a delicate fabric, then you may want to place a t-shirt or thin towel over the tie before you iron it. Place your iron on its lowest setting as well. Making an Easy Baby Bow Tie Cut a square and a rectangle out of a piece of lightweight fabric. Make the square 5 by 5 inches (13 by 13 cm) and the rectangle 1 by 3 inches (2.5 by 7.6 cm). Cotton works best, but you can use any lightweight fabric you want. Use your ruler to measure the fabric and mark where you need to cut it with a piece of chalk. Then, cut along the chalk lines to get the 2 pieces. Make sure to cut the fabric carefully to avoid jagged edges. Fold the square piece in half with the wrong sides facing out. Then, add a line of hot glue along the raw edge on the right (print) side of the fabric. Press the edges together to create a seam. If desired, you may also sew a straight stitch about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the raw edge of the fabric to secure the edges together. Be careful not to touch the hot glue with your bare fingers. You may want to wear gloves or use the ruler to press down on the edges of the fabric. Invert the tube of fabric so that the right sides are exposed. Once the glue is cool and the edges are secured, turn the tube of fabric so that the right sides are facing out and the raw edges of the seam are hidden. Then, flatten the tube and position the glued seam so that it is in the center of 1 side of the rectangle, not on the edge. Fold the ends in by 0.25 in (0.64 cm) to hide the raw edges. Make sure that the ends are even. Then, add a line of hot glue along the fold on the inside of the tube. Press the edges together using your gloved fingers or a ruler. If desired, you may also use an iron to press the tube and the folded ends before you add the glue. This may help to keep the tube flat. Fold the small strip so the edges overlap and secure them with glue. Lay the small strip so that the right side is facing down and apply a line of hot glue down the center of the strip. Then, fold 1 of the long sides over to the center of the strip and apply another line of hot glue over the edge of the strip. Fold the other side over that 1 and press it down to secure it. If desired, you may iron the folded strip before you glue it. This may help to keep it flat. Pinch and fold the middle of the fabric into the shape of an accordion. Loosen your grip on the center slightly to expose the area between the folds. Then, apply a few dabs of hot glue to the areas between the folds and press the folds back together. Repeat this on both sides of the bow to secure the folds in the center. You can experiment with folds in the center of the bow to find the arrangement that looks best to you. Wrap the smaller fabric piece around the center of the bow. Take the strip of fabric and wrap it around the center of the bow. Then, apply a few drops of hot glue to the back of the bow and wrap 1 end of the fabric strip over it. Then apply another dab of glue onto the strip at the back of the bow, and press the other end into the glue. If there is excess fabric left after gluing the ends, you can cut it to avoid having it visible on the front of the bow tie. Attach a clip to the back of the bow tie using hot glue. Add a line of glue onto the back of the clip and press it onto the back of the bow tie. Hold them together tightly for a minute to allow the glue to cool and bond with the fabric and clip. This will allow you to clip the bow onto the baby\u2019s shirt, or use it as a cute hair clip. You may also sew the bow onto a baby onesie or shirt with a needle and thread. Avoid using a safety pin to attach the bow as this may poke the baby if it comes undone. The baby may also try to put it into their mouth and this could result in injury.",
