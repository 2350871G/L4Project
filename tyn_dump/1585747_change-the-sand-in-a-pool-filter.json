As you do so, alternate between bolts to ensure the pressure is equally distributed around the collar. Reattach the pipes and screw the unions on as tightly as you can to prevent leaks. Backwashing Your Filter Make sure your backwash hose is connected to the backwash valve. Backwashing will flush dirty water out of the system, so it is important it has somewhere to go. Attach a backwash hose to the backwash valve if needed, and make sure the other end feeds out somewhere away from your pool. Turn the filter to backwash.
