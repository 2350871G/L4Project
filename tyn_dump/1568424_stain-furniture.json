If it is already stained you have a decision to make -- either stain over the old color or remove the stain and start over. If there is a finish on the furniture (a clear coat that protects the wood), you must remove this before starting.

        "Simply use a clean rag or sponge to wipe the whole thing with the spirits, then wipe them off with another clean rag.",
        "Apply a wood conditioner for softer or difficult-to-stain woods.",
        "Even the easiest to stain wood -- oak -- could use a little wood conditioner for a better coat.",
        "Wood conditioner, which is easily applied with a paintbrush or clean sponge, should be left to dry for 10-15 minutes.",
        "It is essential for furniture made from:\nAlder\nAspen\nBirch\nMaple\nPine\nFraser\nCeder Wipe the entire piece clean to remove any last dust or wood conditioner.",
        "Right before you start staining, give everything a quick wipe to prevent any dust or dirt from being accidentally stained over.",
        "Consider a chemical stripper of you want to drastically change the furniture's color.",
        "If the piece is already stained dark black, for example, and you want a honey color, you'll likely be sanding all day just to get started.",
        "The alternative is a chemical stripper which, though messy, will remove the majority of coloring.",
        "To use one, purchase a stripper labeled \"wash away\" or \"no cleanup,\" then move your furniture to a well-ventilated area:\nPut on gloves and eye protection.",
        "Apply a thick coat of chemical stripper on the entirety of the wood.",
        "Let the stripper sit according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
        "Use a putty knife to scrape away the stripper, working in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "Scrub away any last stripper with steel wool.",
        "Sand the furniture with a fine-grit paper (200 or higher) once it is dry.",
        "Staining Effectively Choose a water or oil based stain, depending on your desired finish.",
        "While there are some hybrid stains, most people buy either water-based or oil-based stains.",
        "Water-based stains are non-toxic and easy to clean, but can cause some streaking if you're not careful.",
        "Oil-based stains are easier to apply evenly but produce stronger fumes and can be tough to clean.",
        "If the piece of furniture can easily be moved outside, to the garage, or to another easy-to-clean area, go with oil-based stains.",
        "Get a clean paint brush, sponge, or foam brush.",
        "You want something absorbent but soft.",
        "Foam brushes, especially those with a pointed edge to get in the corners, are your best bet.",
        "Clean, soft rags and towels will work as well, though they will be permanently colored by the stain.",
        "Open and stir the stain thoroughly.",
        "Make sure that is well mixed, following the instructions on the can.",
        "Be sure to keep the top as well, as you can close up the stain and save it for another project if there is any left.",
        "Test your stain in an inconspicuous area to ensure it looks good.",
        "Find a hard-to-see area and apply a little stain in an square.",
        "Make sure it doesn't drip, then wipe it off after 4-5 minutes and check the color.",
        "Keep an exact measurement of the time you let it sit for.",
        "How does this stain work with the wood's natural color?",
        "If you want the finished piece to be darker than this test area, you'll need to leave the stain on longer before wiping it off.",
        "If you want the finished piece to be lighter you'll have to wipe the stain off faster than you did for the test area.",
        "Wipe the furniture with a damp cloth, then sand with 220 grit paper if using a water-based stain.",
        "As wood absorbs moisture, it slightly expands.",
        "By getting the surface damp and then sanding down the small burrs or bumps that rise up, you better prepare the wood for your water-based stain.",
        "While optional, this step can even help with oil-based stains.",
        "It will result in a smoother finished surface.",
        "Apply the stain in a thin, even coat.",
        "Use your rag, sponge, or brush to apply a thin, even layer of stain over the entire piece.",
        "Work slowly, only keeping a little stain on the brush at any one time to prevent dripping or pooling.",
        "It should be thin enough that the stain isn't running, just sitting on the furniture.",
        "Make a final pass over the stain in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "You can apply the stain any way you want, but your last pass of the brush or rag should be along the direction of the grains.",
        "This ensures a beautiful, non-streaky final finish.",
        "Wipe the stain off with a clean cloth after it has soaked for your desired time.",
        "Remember -- the longer you leave it on, the darker the color will be.",
        "While you can choose your timing based on your own desires, make sure that it doesn't dry on the wood.",
        "If it is starting to dry, wipe it off immediately -- you can also apply a second coat later on if  you desire a darker color.",
        "Let the wood dry for 6-8 hours.",
        "Check the stain's instructions to see if you need to wait even longer, though most stains will be dry within half a day or less.",
        "Try to place the wood in a well-ventilated area to speed up the process and prevent fumes from collecting.",
        "Finishing the Job Apply a second coat of stain after the first has dried for a darker color.",
        "This second coat generally doesn't need to be left on for long.",
        "Simply apply it just like the first coat, wiping off after 2-3 minutes.",
        "Let it all dry for another 6-8 hours before moving on.",
        "Do not add this second coat until the first has finished drying.",
        "Finish the furniture after you're done sanding to protect it.",
        "Stain is for looks, but it will not protect the wood from moisture, oils, or warping.",
        "For that you will need to finish the final piece, protecting both the wood and your stain.",
        "You can choose from the following options:\nWater-based polyurethane\nPolyurethane\nWood lacquer\nFinishing oils Use a water-based polyurethane for a safe and easy finish.",
        "Using a clean cloth or foam brush, simply apply a thin, even coat of polyurethane to the wood, then let it dry.",
        "Don't worry if it looks milky or white as you apply it -- it will dry clear.",
        "Water-based polyurethane is, by far, the easiest finish to apply, though it is less protective of water or oil than other finishes.",
        "Use a traditional polyurethane for a strong, protective coating.",
        "Apply 2-3 thin coats, making sure there are no bubbles on each one.",
        "Let each coat dry, then sand it with 220 grit paper before applying the next one.",
        "This is the thicker, almost plastic-like clear coating on many tables and desks.",
        "If your furniture is going to be prone to nicks, scratches, and scuffs, this is your best bet for protection.",
        "Try out a wood lacquer for a gorgeous, soft finish on high-end furniture.",
        "To apply it, use a paint sprayer and aim for an even coat throughout.",
        "A natural-bristle brush can also be used, but you must work quickly, as lacquer dries quickly.",
        "Let it dry, using a brush to remove any bubbles or unevenness, then sand with fine-grit (220 or higher) paper.",
        "Apply 2-3 more coats, sanding between each one.",
        "Lacquer is harder to apply but worth the effort for expensive pieces.",
        "Apply a penetrating oil, like tung, Danish, or antique oil, for a light and beautiful finish.",
        "Apply a little bit of oil to a clean rag and rub it into the dry, stained wood.",
        "Let it soak according to the oil's instructions, then rub it off with a clean rag and apply 1-2 more coats.",
        "If the piece is subject to lots of wear and tear, this is not a very protective coating.",
        "You should use something more durable."
