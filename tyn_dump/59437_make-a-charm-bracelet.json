    "text": " Making a Charm Bracelet with a Chain Begin with a chain about 10 inches long. You can either cut the chain from an old chain necklace or even recycle an old charm bracelet. If you prefer, you can buy a length of jewelry chain at a craft store. Attach a lobster claw to one end of the chain with a jump ring. There's no reason to attach another claw to the other end of the chain. You can simply fasten the bracelet by grabbing the end of the chain with the lobster claw. Hang charms from the chain with jump rings. Using needle-nosed or jewelry pliers, attach jump rings to any charms or beads you plan to hang on the bracelet. Be sure to attach the jump rings so the charms will all hang on the same side of the chain and face the same direction. Making a Charm Bracelet with String Cut yarn, wire or embroidery thread long enough for a bracelet. The length should be long enough to loosely and comfortably wrap around your wrist. Make sure you leave extra length to tie into knots. Slide closed safety pins on to the string and secure them with knots. Place the safety pins at equal intervals across the string. As each pin is placed, secure it by tying an overhand knot before placing the next pin. Add beads and charms to the safety pins. Open each safety pin individually. Slide a variety of beads and charms onto the pins. Close the safety pins. As you finish adding beads and charms to each safety pin, close it to prevent them from sliding off the pin. Try on the bracelet and see how it fits. Wrap the bracelet around you wrist and tie the two ends together. Creating a Charm Bracelet with Safety Pins Gather enough safety pins to reach around your wrist. When the safety pins are connected to one another, they should be long enough to comfortably wrap around your wrist. String beads onto each safety pin. Open the first safety pin, and string beads or charms onto it. Close the pins to keep the decorations in place. Attach the safety pins to one another. Open a second safety pin and stick the pin through the empty space in the middle of the first pin to form a short chain. After you string beads and charms onto the second pin, close it immediately. Continue adding and adorning pins to form a chain. The chain will be transformed into a bracelet when it wraps around your wrist. When the chain is long enough, take the last pin, drape it around your wrist, and chain it together with the first one.",
