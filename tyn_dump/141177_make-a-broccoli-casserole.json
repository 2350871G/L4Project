If you can\u2019t steam it in the bag, put the broccoli in a microwave-safe bowl, cover it, and microwave it for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until it is fork-tender. Cook fresh broccoli by steaming it until tender if you prefer. Be careful when removing the broccoli from the microwave\u2014it\u2019ll be really hot, so use oven mitts to protect yourself."
