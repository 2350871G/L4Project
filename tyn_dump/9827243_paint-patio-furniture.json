Avoid painting on a day that\u2019s too windy or in an area with constant direct sunlight, because the paint can dry too fast and its lifespan can be reduced. Keep a few cinder blocks or blocks of wood on hand for elevating the pieces of furniture without tipping them over.

If you\u2019re working indoors, for example your garage, be sure that there\u2019s plenty of ventilation so you don\u2019t get sick from chemical fumes."

You may not be able to remove all the rust with the brush. Just get through the top layers to make your next steps easier.

Use an old towel that you\u2019re comfortable throwing away after finishing this step. Continue using the wire brush to scrub rust off the areas where you\u2019ve applied rust remover.

        "Just get through the top layers to make your next steps easier.",
        "Elevating your chair or table on blocks during this step can help you see any spots of rust or loose paint down near the leg bottoms.",
        "Use muriatic acid or another rust remover to get areas of stubborn rust.",
        "If all your rust doesn\u2019t come off with just the brush, you\u2019ll need to apply some rust remover such as muriatic, phosphoric, or hydrochloric acid.",
        "Rust remover products are available at your local hardware store.",
        "Apply some solution with a towel, while wearing gloves and eye protection, to the rusted areas according to your product\u2019s instructions.",

        "Allow your furniture to dry for 45 minutes between coats.",
        "You may want to apply more than one coat of paint to your furniture to get the color exactly how you want or to cover any missed spots.",

        "If you use an electric sander, be sure to sand lightly and evenly to avoid chipping your wood.",

        "For painting with a brush, dip the brush in the paint can and allow excess paint to drip off before applying the paint in a thin layer in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "Allow the first layer to dry for at least 45 minutes before adding another layer, and allow that same amount of time between any subsequent layers you paint.",
        "Be sure to get every nook and cranny of the furniture, including the joints, underneath, and the bottoms of the legs.",
