Loop the yarn around your middle and index fingers 2 times, then pull the first loop through the second loop.

You can use any type of yarn you like as long as the crochet hook is the appropriate size for it. Check the label on your yarn for a hook size recommendation if you\u2019re unsure.

Double crochet 1 time into the third stitch from the hook. Loop the yarn over the hook 1 time and then insert it into the third stitch from your crochet hook. Yarn over again, and pull through 1 stitch. Then, yarn over again and pull through 2 stitches. Yarn over 1 more time, and pull through 2 to complete the stitch. Repeat this stitch sequence each time you work a double crochet stitch. Work 1 double crochet into each stitch to the end of the row. Keep working double crochet stitches to the end of the row. Make sure that each chain has 1 double crochet in it. At the end of the row, count to ensure that you have a multiple of 4 double crochet stitches in the row.Tip: If you end up with one too few or too many stitches, either add a stitch at the end by working an increase, or go back and remove a stitch. Working the Second Row Chain 3 and turn your work around. Loop the yarn around the hook and pull it through to create the first chain. Then, repeat this 2 more times for a total of 3 chains.Tip: This chain of 3 is the turning chain, which provides slack to turn the work around and begin the next row. It\u2019s important to do this after every row to avoid puckered edges. Double crochet under the third post in your row. Loop the yarn over your hook and insert the hook under the third post, which is the third double crochet stitch in the row. Push the hook under it on one side and back up on the other side. Loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through 1. Yarn over again and pull through 2. Yarn over 1 more time and pull through 2 to complete the stitch. This is called a front post double crochet (FPDC). Work another front post double crochet under the fourth post. Yarn over the hook, then insert it under the fourth post. Pull through and then continue to follow the same sequence as you did for the last stitch. Working the third and fourth posts first allows you to go back to the first and second posts, which is what creates the criss-cross effect of the Celtic weave stitch. Go back to the first post and work a front post double crochet. Bring the hook back over to the beginning of the row, loop the yarn over the hook, and push the hook under the first stitch in the row. Then, work a front post double crochet under the first double crochet stitch. Do another front post double crochet behind the second post. To complete the first criss-cross sequence, yarn over the hook one more time, insert the hook under the second stitch in the row, and work a front post double crochet stitch. This completes your first set of 4 stitches, which will form an X-shape. Move to the next set of 4 and repeat the sequence to the end of the row. Repeat the same pattern in the same way you just did for the next set of 4 stitches. This will create another X-shape. After you complete this set, move on to the next set of 4 and continue in this manner to the end of the row. Since you chained a multiple of 4, you should be able to complete sets of 4 all the way across your work. Crocheting the Third Row Chain 3 and turn your work around. Loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through to make a chain. Then, make 2 more chains for a total of 3. Turn the work around so that the opposite side is now facing you. The back side of your crochet work is usually called the \u201cwrong\u201d side in patterns and the front side if often called the \u201cright\u201d side. Work a back post double crochet into the third post in the row. Yarn over your crochet hook, then insert it under the third post in your row on the back side of your work. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through 1. Yarn over again and pull through 2, then yarn over again and pull through 2 again. This completes the first back post double crochet stitch. The back post double crochet (BPDC) is just like the front post double crochet stitch, except you\u2019re working under the stitch behind your work (the side facing away from you) instead of in front of it. This is necessary to keep the pattern all on the same side of your work since you turn it over after each row. Do a back post double crochet into the fourth post in the row. Follow the same stitch sequence as you did for the last back post double crochet. Work this BPDC into the fourth stitch in your row. Move back over to the first post and double crochet behind it. Next, yarn over and bring the hook back to the first post in the row. Insert the hook under the post on the back side of your work. Then, yarn over again and pull through 1. Yarn over and pull through 2, then yarn over and pull through 2 again to finish the stitch.Tip: It may help to stretch your stitches apart slightly as you return to the beginning of the row. Finish with a back post double crochet behind the second post. Follow the same BPDC sequence for the second stitch in the row. Yarn over, then insert the hook under the second stitch and continue the stitch sequence. This will complete your first set of 4 BPDC stitches on the back side of your work. Repeat the sequence for each set of 4 posts to the end of the row. Continue to work in sets of 4 on the back side until you reach the end of the row. Each set that you work will form an X shape. Alternate between rows 2 and 3 to continue the pattern. After you have completed row 3, go back to row 2 and work this sequence again. Continue to alternate between rows 2 and 3 until your item is the desired size. After your item is the desired length, tie off the last stitch and cut the excess yarn.",
