Keep at least one sealed bottle of water in your bag and pack more if you can stand the weight. Make sure it's in a durable container so you can refill it and close it easily. Pack granola bars, S.O.S. bars, or protein bars that are high in calories and carbohydrates and store well long term. Food is not only necessary for energy, it can be great for morale. Dried fruit is also an excellent option. Peanut butter (assuming you're not allergic to peanuts) comes in handy tubes, is an excellent source of protein, and does not require refrigeration or cooking."

Subways can be down and vehicles backed up because of non-working traffic lights. Think ahead! Make a plan! Visit a fabric or athletic store or look online for reflective tape. Buy 1\u20133 yards (0.9\u20132.7 m) as you will add it to your backpack and other items if necessary. It's usually sold in rolls and is 1\" wide or wider. Add the reflective tape to the exterior of your backpack. Use fabric glue to attach it if you don't sew. Attach the reflective tape to the back of the bag and the front straps.

This can protect you from the elements on a long walk, provide shelter, and, when covered in the reflective tape, make you stand out to drivers and other people. You should add reflective tape to your raincoat since wearing it may cover the tape on your backpack. Pack the folded poncho in your backpack. If it doesn't fold into itself (as many do), you can compress it into a small bag to keep it out of your way. You can also wrap thick rubber hair bands to compress it. Those will also come in handy to keep long hair out of the way during the emergency. (Hair in the eyes can obstruct vision in addition to being frustrating.)"

Your safety may depend on moving quickly and traveling efficiently on foot. Athletic shoes are an absolute must in every person's grab-and-go work kit. Don't use a new pair, as these can cause blisters; pack a pair that is broken in but not worn out, if possible. Even a worn pair is better than wingtips or heels. Many athletic shoes have reflective trims but you can add more. You should still have some tape left over from the poncho and backpack."

You can even add a piece of the reflective tape to make it easier to find if you drop it or are looking for it in a dark pack. Include the following items:\nAdhesive bandages: A few of each size will do. Pack mostly the 1\" since they work well for blisters. Bandages that are foam instead of fabric offer more protection for blisters and can still be used for other first aid. Antibiotic first aid ointment. Benadryl or other antihistamine: emergencies are not a good time to have an allergic reaction. Epi-pen if you have been given one by your doctor for severe allergies. They're usually willing to write prescriptions for several so you can keep several available. Prescription medication to last a day or two in a well-labeled container. If your medication changes, you need to update your kit. Be very specific when labeling describe the pill bottle, the dose, and what it treats. Don't forget an asthma inhaler if you are an asthmatic. You may be walking and air quality could be questionable. Pain killers, such as aspirin. Look in the travel/trial size section of stores for small bottles. An ace bandage, which is great for rolled ankles or can be used to immobilize a limb. Latex or vinyl gloves (if you are allergic to latex) are a must. You could be around injured people or need to treat someone with your first aid kit. Anti-bacterial hand gel for cleaning up. Washcloth or hand towel: can be used for clean up, wiping a sweaty brow or signaling. Find a travel/trial size of saline solution (or contact lens wetting solution) and include it in your kit. Flushing eyes may be necessary for contact lens wearers or for anyone in dusty or polluted air. It can also be used to irrigate a wound. Assorted gauze or other first aid items.

Decide if you can tolerate the weight and have room. You can go full size (D cell) if you have room and can stand the weight. You won't get a warning on a massive power outage or evacuation.

Even better, hang a combination lockbox from your home door (if allowed;) with a spare key in it. These are $30 at a hardware store and also come in handy anytime you or a family member accidentally lock yourself out or if you need to call a neighbor to enter your home when you are away, and you won't need to risk losing a spare stored elsewhere. An additional advantage is that if you don't carry a spare key in your emergency kit, you can put your address on a luggage/ID tag attached to it. A spare car key could also be helpful depending on your situation (or in a magnetic wheel-well box - these really work! )."

Check travel sites, mobile phone supply stores, or airport kiosks. Pack some cash -- but not too much. Stash cash for public phones, food vending, or any thing else that could come up. Don't keep too much, just a few dollars and quarters. You can often hide it under the sturdy cardboard bottom. You can use this for transportation or to buy food or drink. Don't forget to include several quarters should you need to use a public phone and be able to find one. Pack a small pack of tissues and moist wipes. It may provide dual use in case the restroom facilities lack proper supplies. Think of the different things you may encounter on the way home. Every city and its facilities are different. Add an all-purpose pocket tool or Swiss Army knife. Multipurpose tools are available at most sporting goods or camping stores. The one shown here has pliers, which can be very handy. There are too many ways to use one of these to begin to list them all. Pack a small radio. Many local radio stations switch to emergency programming during an emergency. Look for a small, battery operated FM transistor radio for your bag. These can be found in discount stores or electronic stores for minimal investment. All local radio stations will begin emergency broadcasting if there is an emergency in your area. Make sure it has fresh batteries and is turned off before adding it to your bag. Tape an extra house key into the bottom of the bag underneath the cardboard bottom. If you leave a house key, don't add anything to identify it as such. Even better, hang a combination lockbox from your home door (if allowed;) with a spare key in it. These are $30 at a hardware store and also come in handy anytime you or a family member accidentally lock yourself out or if you need to call a neighbor to enter your home when you are away, and you won't need to risk losing a spare stored elsewhere. An additional advantage is that if you don't carry a spare key in your emergency kit, you can put your address on a luggage/ID tag attached to it. A spare car key could also be helpful depending on your situation (or in a magnetic wheel-well box - these really work! ). Maintaining the Bag Resist the urge to tap into your bag for water, snacks, or band-aids. Keep the kit intact and only open it to check medication expiration dates, check or replace batteries or replace dated food. Pack your bag and store it in a locker, under your desk, in a filing cabinet nearby, or somewhere else it can be grabbed in a hurry. If in doubt, grab it. Everything you need will fit easily in a backpack. If you live in colder climates you can add additional supplies or change your pack for the seasons. Take it for fire drills and other alarms. Keep it handy when news has reached you of an emergency in your city. You may not realize you are in an evacuation situation until you've been separated from your kit. In large cities, earthquake or tornado prone areas, and large office buildings, it is wise to be a little paranoid. Renew your kit regularly. Set a reminder on your phone or computer to check your bag every few months. You might want to check twice a year (perhaps when you replace your smoke detector batteries or set clocks forward or back for daylight savings time), use family birthdays as reminders, or set the reminders on your desktop calendar. At least check once a year on a reminder date. Check the perishables (batteries, food, and first aid items) for expiration, leaking, or borrowing. Verify that maps and phone numbers are all up-to-date. Check for brittle gloves, missing items, operation electronics, and anything else that could go wrong that you wouldn't want to face in an emergency. Send an email to your home computer with a list of items you'll need to restock it, or print your list. You may not remember once you leave the office. Creating a Plan Evaluate where you work and how far you live from work. Don't think of it in regular transportation terms. Ask yourself what you would do if you had to get home without the use of a car or public transportation during an emergency. What would you have to wear to get home from work on foot, and how long would it take? Make a family emergency plan. Discuss with your family what you may do in an emergency if they can't reach you by cell phone. Discuss your options and what scenarios would be practical. Knowing what your actions may be will enable them to assist even if you can't communicate during the emergency. If your family hears of an emergency, they may be able to pick up your kids, meet you at a meeting place, or be ready to spring into action when they get your call, text, or third-party message. Have a family action plan. Create a buddy system with a coworker. Coordinate with your co-workers and exchange ideas for creating individual jump-and-run bags ideal for your situation, urban area, and workplace. If you work with someone who also lives near you, discuss in advance and plan on using the buddy system to get home together. Have them pack a bag so you each have supplies. Talk to management about turning kit-making into an office social or emergency planning exercise. Get permission for everyone to bring their items, pack them as a team, and make a store trip for forgotten supplies.",
