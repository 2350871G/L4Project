In some cases, this may cause dust and bugs to fly out the opposite end of the shade. You may want to lay down a drop cloth or newspaper to catch ejected matter and contain a potential mess. You can also spray the outer fabric of your shades with compressed air as a dusting measure. Spray each row/pleat of the fabric from top to bottom, end to end with the compressed air. If you don\u2019t have compressed air, you can use a blow dryer set to \u201cLow\u201d on \u201cCool.\u201d Avoid using hot air, which can cause the glue used to make the shade to weaken."
