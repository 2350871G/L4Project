                    "description": "While true henna has a reddish, coppery tone, the color is translucent so it blends with your hair color. That means it won\u2019t look the same on everyone. The lighter your natural hair color, the more vivid red your hair will be. With very dark hair, henna likely won\u2019t impart much color, so you\u2019ll just wind up with added shine. Pale blonde, gray, and white hair will wind up with a true, vibrant red shade. Mid-tone hair colors, such as dirty blonde and light brown, typically turn a richer, almost auburn shade. If you have red or auburn hair, you likely won\u2019t see much change with henna. However, it can enhance the natural tones in your hair and cover grays. Dark hair shades, including chocolate brown and black, won\u2019t see any real color change with henna, but your locks will look shinier and glossier afterward. If you do have some grays mixed in with your natural color, keep in mind that you won\u2019t wind up with a uniform color. The henna will make the gray pieces appear like highlights, which can be a nice look with light and mid tone hair shades. With dark hair, though, the red highlights may look strange."

Henna powder is typically available in boxes, but you can also purchase it as a brick. Read the package instructions carefully to determine how much henna you\u2019ll need. If you have short hair no longer than your chin, a 100-gram box of henna is usually enough. For shoulder-length hair, start with 200 grams of henna. If your hair is past your shoulders, you\u2019ll want to have at least 300 grams of henna on hand. For extremely long hair, you may need as much as 500 grams of henna to color your entire head."

Try to remove as many as the lumps as possible, so the mixture has a smooth texture like yogurt. You can use other liquids to mix your henna. Lemon, orange, and grapefruit juice are common alternatives. If you don\u2019t mind the smell, vinegar is another option. To get the consistency right, it helps to add the liquid a little at a time so you have better control. If the mixture is too thick and stiff, you can add more liquid. It's also a good idea to have extra henna powder on hand, so you can add a little more if the mixture becomes too thin or runny. Just as with the liquid, though, add the powder in small amounts to ensure you don't overdo it."

Applying petroleum jelly or another thick cream or balm along your hairline, ears, and necks will prevent the henna from staining your skin. Make sure to wear rubber, latex, or some other type of protective gloves while you\u2019re applying the mixture to your hair. Wear clothes that you don\u2019t mind getting stained when you apply the henna because drips or spills may happen, and you won\u2019t be able to get the color out of your clothing. It\u2019s a good idea to apply your henna in the shower or bathtub, so you don\u2019t have worry about getting it on your furniture, carpeting, or other surfaces. If you do get henna on your skin, wipe it away immediately. The longer that it sits on your skin, the worse the stain will be. It can take several days for a henna to fade from the skin."

Take your time to ensure that you cover every strand with the henna too. Do your best to avoid getting henna on the sections that you\u2019re not working on at the moment. Henna can tangle your hair very easily, which may make it harder to work with the other sections later. You can use a piping bag or squeeze bottle to apply the henna if you're having trouble controlling where it goes, but it's usually easier to use your fingers so you can really work it into your hair. For total coverage, apply the henna all the way up to your scalp. You may notice some slight staining, but it typically fades with a couple of hair washes. Because the thickness of henna can make it difficult to apply, you may want to ask a friend to help you color your hair, especially if you have long or extremely thick hair."
