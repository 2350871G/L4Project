See if there is a hobby shop that sells remote-controlled cars and visit the store to see what kits they have available. If you don\u2019t have a hobby shop near you, look for stores online that sell kits. RC kits can start anywhere from $50 USD and reach prices up to $1,000 USD depending on the size and components. If you want a smaller and simpler build, get a cheaper RC kit. For a more complex build, look for a more expensive kit. RC kits come in many shapes, sizes, and colors.
