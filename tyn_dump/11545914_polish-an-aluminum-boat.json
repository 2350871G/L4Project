Turn it on and spray down all the aluminum surfaces with plain water to remove built-up grime, grease, algae, minerals, and any other dirt on the surface. If you don\u2019t have a power washer, you can rent one at a home improvement center or hardware store. Alternatively, you can rinse the boat with a regular hose and scrub away buildup with a towel or sponge. Wear closed-toe shoes and eye protection whenever you operate a power washer. If you have a loud gas power washer, it\u2019s a good idea to wear earplugs as well. If you have a saltwater boat and there are barnacles on the hull, spray them at an angle with the power washer to get under the edges and remove them. If this doesn\u2019t work, try scraping them off with a plastic putty knife."
