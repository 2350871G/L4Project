Then, use 100-180 grit sandpaper to sand the wood and make painting easier. Take a small sheet of sandpaper and rub it lightly along a section of baseboard by using back-and-forth strokes until you see the previous layer of paint smoothing into the wood. Wipe your boards with a dry cloth after sanding. If your baseboards are brand new or haven\u2019t been painted multiple times in the past, you don\u2019t need to sand them down. Be careful when sanding the upper and lower sections of your baseboard near the wall and carpet. You don\u2019t want to scuff the walls while you work. Let your baseboards air dry for at least an hour before you paint them. You don\u2019t want to capture any moisture in the wood. Wear a dust mask when sanding your baseboards to prevent the inhalation of wood dust."

        "Open the windows in the room that you\u2019re painting to prevent the paint fumes from overwhelming you.",
        "Dip an angle brush in the paint and tap it in the tray.",
        "A 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) angle brush will make it easier to paint your baseboards.",
        "You can use a natural or nylon brush.",
        "Dip the tip of your brush into the paint so that the tip of your brush is covered in paint.",
        "Tap the brush into the dry section of your paint tray to remove excess paint.",
        "You can use a flat brush if you prefer, but an angle brush will make it easier to reach the very bottom of your baseboard, since you can get a flat cut by holding it at 45 degrees.",
        "Start with the middle of the baseboard before painting the top.",
        "Start painting the middle portion of your baseboards first, using back-and-forth strokes to cover each section of baseboard 2-3 times.",
        "Once the majority of the paint on your brush has been applied, paint the portion directly above it near the tape.",
        "Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle and only brush the top in the direction of the brush\u2019s angle to monitor the accuracy of your cut.",
        "Work slowly when painting along the edge, and work in 1 foot (30 cm) increments.",
        "Paint the bottom of your baseboard carefully.",
        "Once you\u2019ve painted the top and middle of your board, dip your brush into the paint tray and tap it repeatedly to remove most of the paint.",
        "Then, tilt your brush so that it\u2019s at a 45-degree angle with the long end facing the carpet.",
        "Press your brush into the board and move very slowly and carefully along the bottom of the baseboard.",
        "If you\u2019re using a paint guard, hold it in place with your nondominant hand.",
        "Only brush along the section where you\u2019re holding the paint guard.",
        "To remove and replace a paint guard, press it down into the carpet and slowly slide it out.",
        "Move it to a different section of your baseboard and press it down again before sliding it between the baseboard and carpet.",
        "Wipe your paint guard with a clean rag after painting each section.",
        "Work your way around the room in 1 foot (30 cm) increments.",
        "If you\u2019re using a paint guard, bring it with you as you paint around the room.",
        "Move your drop cloth with you as you work so that it\u2019s always underneath the section that you\u2019re painting.",

        "Avoid drips by covering each section in the middle 2-3 times before moving on.",
        "Remove the tape carefully after your paint has dried.",
        "Once you\u2019ve let your baseboards dry for 2-3 hours, remove the drop cloth and other painting materials.",
        "Pull the long side of the masking tape up a little and slide it out from under your baseboard.",
        "Slowly pull it out in sections to avoid rubbing any dry paint on your carpet."
