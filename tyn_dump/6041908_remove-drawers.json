If the drawer doesn\u2019t have a stopper, it should come right out. If you encounter resistance, you\u2019ll need to move the drawer around a little in order to work it free. Most drawers contain some type of stopping mechanism designed to keep them from falling out accidentally. In free-rolling drawers, the stopper is typically a small raised lip on the front side of the interior track. Be sure to keep enough space between you and the front of the drawer to allow it to extend all the way out.Tip: Wood-Glide draws can sometimes seem to stick a little, even if they\u2019re not fitted with stoppers. Before you start searching for obstructions, try giving the drawer a good tug to see if that gets it past its sticking point."
