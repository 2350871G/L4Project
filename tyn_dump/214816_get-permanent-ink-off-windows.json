If you have sensitive skin, you may want to wear plastic gloves while working with rubbing alcohol. Wipe the ink stain with the alcohol-soaked cloth.

Acetone-based nail polish is a very strong solvent. Crack a window and turn on the ceiling fan to keep air-flow moving. Is possible, work outside. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to wear plastic gloves while working with acetone. Soak paper towels with the nail polish remover. Make sure you're using acetone-based nail polish! Non-acetone remover won't work. Uncap the bottle and pour it liberally on a wad of paper towels. You want the towels to be saturated with acetone. Wipe the ink-stained surface. Acetone is strong and effective, so you shouldn't have to scrub the stain vigorously. Wipe the glass until all of the ink has lifted. Apply more acetone as needed. Rinse the surface with a dampened cloth. Wet a clean cloth with water, then wring it out thoroughly so that it's damp, not soaked. Wipe the surface with the cloth to rinse away any acetone residue on the glass. If any acetone got on your hands, wash them with soap and water afterwards.",
