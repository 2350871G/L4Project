        "Mixing Colored Powders with Oil Choose a pigment powder, mica, or natural powder.",
        "Natural powders are things like oxides, clays, and spices.",
        "Synthetic pigments are similar color-wise, but they're made in a lab.",
        "Most mica pigments are natural, but they tend to bleed into other colors.",
        "Here are some popular color choices:\nRed: madder root, sandalwood powder, or Moroccan red clay\nOrange/salmon: cayenne pepper or paprika\nYellow: safflower powder, calendula petals, or turmeric\nGreen: French green clay\nBrown: ground cloves, nutmeg, or all spice\nPurple: alkanet root Mix 1 teaspoon of pigment with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lightweight oil for cold process soap.",
        "Pour 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of a lightweight oil into a small dish, then add 1 teaspoon of your desired powdered pigment.",
        "Stir the two together until the color is consistent and no lumps remain.",
        "Skip this step if you are making melt and pour soap.",
        "Great oil choices include avocado and sweet almond.",
        "Avoid solid oils, like coconut oil.",
        "If you are using clay as your natural colorant, it would be better to stick with distilled water instead.",
        "Don't use tap or filtered water.",
        "This is enough to color 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of soap.",
        "You probably won't use all of the dye, however.",
        "Stir 1 teaspoon of pigment into 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of rubbing alcohol for melt and pour soap.",
        "Pour 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of 99% isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) into a small dish.",
        "Stir in 1 teaspoon if your desired pigment powder.",
        "Keep stirring until the color and texture are even.",
        "Skip this step if you're making cold process soap from scratch.",
        "If you're using clay, stick with distilled water instead.",
        "Avoid tap or filtered water, however.",
        "This is enough to dye 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of soap.",
        "Keep in mind that you don't have to use all of your dye.",
        "Prepare a batch of cold process soap and bring it to trace.",
        "Trace is a soap making term for the specific stage soap enters after you mix the oils and lye together.",
        "It refers to when the mixture is thick enough that you can \"trace\" lines through it using a spoon.",
        "If you're making melt and pour soap, melt it in a large measuring cup in the microwave for about 1 minute, or until it's fully melted.",
        "At this point, you can add in any essential oils or soap making fragrance oils you desire.",
        "Stir the dye into the soap gradually until you get the shade you want.",
        "Start with 1 teaspoon of dye for every 1 pound (450 g) of cold process soap, or 1/4 teaspoon of dye for every 1 pound (450 g) of melt and pour soap.",
        "A little bit goes a long way, so you may not even use all of your dye.",
        "If you're using straight mica for melt and pour soap, you may see bubbles form.",
        "If that happens, mist them with rubbing alcohol.",
        "If the soap is coming out speckled, use an immersion blender to mix the pigment into it.",
        "Add any extras, pour the soap into molds, and allow it to harden.",
        "At this point, you can stir extras into your soap, such as exfoliants or dried flower petals.",
        "Once you have everything mixed in, pour the soap into soap making molds, then set it aside so that it can harden and cure.",
        "Refer to your recipe to find out how long this will take.",
        "Melt and pour soap requires a few hours to harden, depending on the temperature in the room, and no curing time.",
        "Cold process soap requires a couple of days to harden, after which you can cut it.",
        "Once you've cut it, set it aside on a wire rack for a couple of weeks to cure."
