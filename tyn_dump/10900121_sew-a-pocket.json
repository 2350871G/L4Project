                    "description": "Lay the pocket pattern on the fabric and trace it twice. Then, flip it over and trace it 2 more times, so you have 2 front and 2 back pieces. Make sure you don't end up with 4 of the same piece, especially if your fabric obviously has a right side and a wrong side. Then, cut the pieces out with sharp sewing scissors. If you're sewing from a pattern, it may have a pocket pattern included. If it doesn't, you can buy one wherever you buy sewing supplies, or from a pattern shop online. You can also draw your own pocket pattern on paper if you're experienced with pattern drafting. Draw a straight line for the mouth of the pocket, making sure it's wide enough to fit your hand. Angle the sides of the pocket down at about 45\u00b0, and finish the bottom of the pocket with a curved or straight line. You can also trace around an existing pocket on a pair of pants or a skirt that you already have."

Compare the garment pieces to make sure the pockets are lined up perfectly. For pants and skirts, the top of the pocket should be about 4.5 in (11 cm) below the waistband.

When you're finished, you should have 4 pieces of a garment, each with 1 side of a pocket attached.

        "Also, if you're adding the pocket to an existing garment, take care not to sew the front and back sides of the garment together by accident.",
        "Backstitch at the top corners of the pocket to secure them.",
        "To reinforce the corners of the pocket, sew all the way to the edge of the fabric, then switch the sewing machine to a backstitch and go back over the last \u20442 in (1.3 cm) or so.",
        "Then, sew forward one more time to complete the stitch.",
        "The pocket will be most likely to unravel at the top corners first, so backstitching will help make the pocket stronger.",
        "If you're sewing by hand, just add a few extra stitches going back down the last \u20442 in (1.3 cm) of the seam, then up again."
