Keep in mind that the character's head should be the same size as the rest of the entire body.Tip: Although you can leave the face completely round, many chibi characters have distinctive jawlines. You could draw a square or pointed jaw, for instance. The disproportionately large head will make your chibi character look even cuter."

Place the horizontal line in the lower third of the circle. You'll use these 2 lines as guidelines for placing the facial features.

Include at least 1 white circle in the eye to show the reflection of light. Leave a gap the size of 1 eye between the eyes you drew. The line can pass through the center of the eyes or you can position the eyes so the bottom of the eyes rest on the horizontal line. Remember that you're not trying to make the eyes realistic. Chibi eyes can show any expression, but they're usually exaggerated, shiny, and bold."

You could draw a circle or triangle if you'd like your character's mouth to be open. If you want to make a detailed mouth, you can include teeth or their tongue. The mouth can be as expressive as the eyes. For example, if your chibi character is in love, you might make their mouth heart-shaped."

Play around with drawing wavy, shaggy, or spiked hair, for instance. Let a few strands cover the sides of the character's face or fall across 1 of their eyes.
