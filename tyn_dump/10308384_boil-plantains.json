Yellow plantains should have just a little give, with few (if any) brown spots. Green plantains should be harder, with a uniform color and no spotting. If you use overly ripe plantains, they may become mushy by the time they\u2019re done."

Getting these parts out of the way will make it easier to peel the plantains. Removing the stems also lets in more heat, helping the plantains cook through faster."

Take hold of the skin on either side of the cut and pull it apart to expose the fruit underneath. Be gentle to avoid damaging the fruit. Your plantains won\u2019t take as long to boil if you remove their skin first. If you prefer, you can also simply score the skins from end to end and finish peeling them once they\u2019re fully cooked."
