            "description": "The most versatile technique for getting a percussive sound from a guitar string is by picking it very aggressively, either with your finger or a pick. Pulling the string outward from the guitar's body a bit when picking it will cause it to slap back into place, lending a sharp, percussive sound to the note."

            "description": "Another percussive technique is to slap your picking hand's palm against all the strings. Pushing them hard enough so that they contact the guitar's frets will increase the percussive intensity of this technique. Try employing this slapping technique on the backbeats during a rhythm strumming pattern."

You can use your pinky and ring finger for drumming to keep your other fingers free for picking. You can also free your picking hand entirely for drumming by playing passages entirely using hammer-ons and pull-offs."
