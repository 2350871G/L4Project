        "Once you reach the end of this new round, slip stitch the last and first single crochet together.",
        "Repeat for the next four rounds.",
        "Repeat the first round pattern for rows two through five.",
        "Chain one, then single crochet in each stitch across the round.",
        "Slip stitch the ends together.",
        "You should have a total of five single crochet rounds by the end of this step.",
        "Switch hooks and double crochet around.",
        "Switch to the size G crochet hook.",
        "Chain two, then work one double crochet into the back loop of each stitch across the round.",
        "Work carefully when switching hooks so that you do not lose the hook loop and unravel your previous stitches.",
        "Once you reach the end of the round, slip stitch the last double crochet to the top of the chain-two.",
        "Alternate back post and front post double crochet.",
        "Chain two.",
        "Work one double crochet into the front post of the next stitch, then one double crochet into the back post of the stitch after that.",
        "Work one double crochet into the front post of the following stitch and one double crochet into the back post of the stitch after that; repeat across the remainder of the round.",
        "You should end with a front-post double crochet.",
        "At the end of the round, slip stitch the last double crochet to the top of the chain-two.",
        "Double crochet around.",
        "Chain two.",
        "Double crochet once into the front post of the first stitch, then double crochet once into the back post of the next stitch.",
        "Front post double crochet once into each front-post stitch of the previous round and back post double crochet into each back-post stitch of the previous round.",
        "Continue across the entire round in this manner.",
        "Slip stitch the last double crochet to the top of the chain-two.",
        "Fasten off the yarn.",
        "Cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring 14 inches (35.5 cm) long.",
        "Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.",
        "Fold the piece in half.",
        "Fold the tube in half so that the single crochet rounds are on the inside and the ribbed rounds remain on the outside.",
        "Thread the long tail through the eye of a yarn needle and whip stitch the folded edges together.",
        "Stitch through the back loops of the ribbed edge and the foundation chain loops on the single crochet side.",
        "Knot the yarn after you finish sewing the edges together, then weave in all ends along the underside of the stitches.",
        "Wear the bracelet.",
        "The bracelet should be finished and ready to wear.",
        "Simply slip it over your hand and onto your wrist.",
        "Method Three: Beaded Chain[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Thread the beads.",
        "Thread 12 to 24 beads onto a length of embroidery thread or thin craft wire.",
        "Craft wire can be easier to work with, but the resulting bracelet won't be machine washable and will be stiffer and heavier.",
        "Use enough thread and enough beads to wrap around your wrist.",
        "Do not cut the spool-end of the thread or wire after threading the beads.",
        "Create a stopper.",
        "Clear 2 inches (5 cm) at the tail end of the thread.",
        "Create a loop from this tail, knotting it just above the top bead.",
        "If desired, you could leave beads on the thread used for this loop to create a more decorative stopper.",
        "The size of the stopper should still remain the same, however.",
        "Position the yarn behind the beaded thread.",
        "Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slip knot, then position the hook above the thread.",
        "Place the crochet hook and starting loop above the beaded thread, directly between the looped stopper and the top bead.",
        "The knotted part of the loop and the working end of your thread should fall behind the thread, however.",
        "Attach the yarn to the beaded thread.",
        "Work one chain stitch with the yarn.",
        "As you create this chain, you should trap the base of the thread inside.",
        "Crochet around the first bead.",
        "Chain stitch twice, then slide the first bead beside the base of this chain.",
        "Single crochet around the wire on the opposite side of the bead to lock it into place.",
        "The number of chains may vary depending on the size of the bead.",
        "Create enough chains to extend around the top and side of the entire bead.",
        "Work the single crochet in between the first and second beads.",
        "Since there are no stitches to work into, you'll need to reach beneath the thread with the tip of the hook, grab the yarn there, and work the single crochet stitch around the side of the thread.",
        "Repeat across the row.",
        "Chain two, then single crochet once around the thread on the opposite side of the next bead.",
        "Repeat this pattern across the entire length of beads, or until the bracelet reaches your desired length.",
        "End the pattern with a single crochet beside the final bead.",
        "Note that you may need to make fewer or more chains to work around your beads, but the number of chains should remain consistent from bead to bead.",
        "Work back across the opposite side.",
        "Chain four and flip the work over.",
        "Repeat the same pattern back across the same length, wrapping the yarn across the bottom side of each bead as you go.",
        "Chain two.",
        "Draw the chain around the bottom of the next bead, then single crochet over the thread and beside the single crochet of the previous row.",
        "Repeat this pattern across the entire row, ending with a single crochet to the front of the first bead.",
        "Fasten off the yarn.",
        "Cut the yarn, leaving 3 inches (7.6 cm) of excess.",
        "Pull this excess tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.",
        "If you have a considerable amount of thread in between the crocheted beadwork and the stopper loop, you may wish to wrap the yarn around the exposed thread several times before fastening it off.",
        "Weave the excess tail into the stitches to secure it.",
        "Sew a button onto the opposite end.",
        "Thread a standard sewing needle with all-purpose sewing thread, then stitch the decorative button onto the end of the bracelet opposite the stopper loop.",
        "You should only need to make a few stitches to secure the button to the bracelet.",
        "Use a button that is small enough to fit through the loop yet large enough to avoid slipping through by accident.",
        "Wear the bracelet.",
        "The bracelet should be finished and ready to wear.",
        "Wrap it around your wrist and slide the button through the stopper loop to hold it in place."
