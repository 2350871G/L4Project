Look at your inner wrist under natural light to determine whether you have warm, neutral, or cool undertones. Visit a beauty store and test out a variety of products that are designed to flatter your shade and undertones. Note that some products change color slightly after 1-2 hours of contact with the oils in your skin. For instance, the perfect shade of foundation might get yellowy by the end of the day. Try out samples to see what looks and feels the best after a full day of wear. If your skin gets paler or darker depending on the season, pick one set of products to match your summer skin tone and another for your winter shade."

        "If you leave makeup on your face, it may clog your pores.",
        "Choose a \u201cpore-eliminating\u201d foundation primer for your base layer.",
        "Makeup primers and foundation primers create a uniform base layer that other cosmetic products can be layered onto.",
        "Many primers enable long-lasting wear, and a primer described as \u201cporeless,\u201d \u201cpore-eliminating,\u201d or \u201cskin-smoothing\u201d will establish a smoother skin texture.",
        "Primers help keep your makeup in place so it lasts longer.",
        "Primers won\u2019t literally remove your pores but will instead fill them in, helping mask the indentations left by acne scarring and creating the appearance of a smoother canvas for cosmetics to be applied to.",
        "Try concealers that are specially formulated for use on acne scars and breakouts.",
        "Look for a product containing phrases like \u201cbreakout concealer\u201d or \u201cacne concealer\u201d on the labels.",
        "These are designed to treat current breakouts and prevent future irritations.",
        "For deep scarring, silicone-based acne scar fillers apply a layer of silicone to the surface of your skin.",
        "The silicone fills in any indentations from your scarring and leaves a smooth surface that you can apply foundation and other makeup products onto.",
        "Use a color-correcting concealer to cancel out dark spots.",
        "Acne has a cool tone, so using warm shades can balance it out.",
        "If you have light skin, use a golden peach concealer.",
        "For medium skin, choose a peach undertone.",
        "If your skin is dark, opt for a dark orange tinted color-corrector.",
        "Stipple the color-corrector onto clean, moisturized skin and seal it with a finishing powder.",
        "It might look a little odd at first, but once you layer foundation over the color-correcting product you\u2019ll see the dark spots disappear.",
        "Try not to blend the foundation into the color-correcting product below.",
        "The goal is to keep these layers separate so that they each do their job separately.",
        "Try airbrush makeup or spray-on foundation.",
        "Airbrush makeup kits are typically sold at professional-level prices and will require some practice before you achieve a flawless, evenly layered finish.",
        "But you can pick up a spray-on foundation product to get similar results.",
        "These types of products deliver a fine mist evenly across your skin, which can be layered for the perfect amount of coverage.",
        "Mist and spray foundations are pricier than liquid formulas but they allow you to emulate the look of airbrush makeup at home without the equipment investment.",
        "Airbrush makeup tends to photograph well, so consider booking the services of a makeup artist for a special event.",
        "If you\u2019re a makeup artist, consider airbrush equipment an essential part of your kit.",
        "Clients typically pay more for airbrushing services.",
        "Your clients with acne scars may appreciate having the option to experience the pampering and uniform finish.",
        "Preparing and Priming the Skin Cleanse your skin first.",
        "Start with a clean, fresh face before putting on any makeup.",
        "You might rinse your face off with water or use a daily cleanser \u2013 follow whatever skincare routine your dermatologist recommends.",
        "Exfoliate your skin with a chemical exfoliator to remove dead skin cells.",
        "Choose a product that contains salicylic acid or a similar exfoliator.",
        "Apply a dime-sized amount to your face and scrub it into your skin.",
        "Rinse with cool water to close your pores.",
        "The exfoliator will scrub away dead skin cells so your skin feels smoother and your pores are less likely to get clogged.",
        "Additionally, it will help fade your acne scars.",
        "You can use your exfoliator once a day until your skin looks clear.",
        "After that, it's best to use it just 2-3 times a week so you don't damage your skin.",
        "Moisturize your skin with a lightweight, hydrating product.",
        "Again, follow your dermatologist\u2019s recommendations for the right daily moisturizer.",
        "It should contain SPF to prevent your acne scars from sun damage.",
        "Select something that melts into your skin and doesn\u2019t leave a greasy residue.",
        "It's also a good idea to moisturize your face at night.",
        "Just make sure you're using the lightweight, oil-free moisturizer recommended by your dermatologist.",
        "Treat your skin with a serum that contains vitamin C or hydroquinone.",
        "Pick a healing serum that contains a lightening agent like vitamin c or hydroquinone.",
        "Additionally, check the label to see if it contains antioxidants.",
        "Apply a thin layer of serum to your face before you apply primer.",
        "Then, let it sit for a few minutes so it soaks into your skin.",
        "You can also apply your serum at night before you go to bed.",
        "Apply primer to smooth your skin\u2019s texture and provide a solid base.",
        "Foundation primers create a receptive base for the rest of your cosmetics to latch onto.",
        "Select a primer that has smoothing and \u201cpore-eliminating\u201d properties.",
        "Apply it all over your face with a stippling brush, pressing gently into your skin.",
        "Let the primer dry and set before layering on other cosmetics.",
        "Applying Concealer and Foundation Dot a color-correcting concealer onto dark spots and set with powder.",
        "If you\u2019re going to use a peach or orange toned color correcting product to cancel out the cool, dark undertones of your acne scars, stipple it over the dark areas using a brush.",
        "Cover the centers and outer edges of the dark spots.",
        "Softly blend the product out at the edges using your fingertips.",
        "Push loose or pressed finishing powder into the product using a kabuki brush or powder puff.",
        "Apply a mattifying, full-coverage concealer to your scars.",
        "As with the color-correcting product, use a stippling brush to press the concealer gently into your skin.",
        "Apply it selectively to the areas you\u2019d like to cover up.",
        "Use your fingertips to gently pat the product into your skin.",
        "If your concealer comes with a click-brush or sponge tip applicator, you can use this instead of a separate brush.",
        "Stipple a full-coverage mattifying liquid foundation to your entire face.",
        "Applying foundation with swiping and smearing motions will draw attention to the bumpy texture of your skin and won\u2019t deliver even layers of coverage.",
        "Instead, press the product into your skin to make sure it gets into the deeper parts of the scarring.",
        "Alternately use a beauty blending sponge in the same stippling motions.",
        "Make sure to wash it after each use to prevent bacterial growth.",
        "You can layer buildable products for more coverage over darker spots.",
        "Allow the base layer to dry and then apply another layer to those specific areas.",
        "Setting Your Makeup Set the foundation with a matte pressed powder or loose powder.",
        "Tap a kabuki brush or powder puff into your chosen powder to pick up a thin layer of product.",
        "For loose powders, shake out a little product into the jar lid and press the brush into the lid.",
        "Then deliberately press the brush or powder puff into your skin.",
        "Move across your face until you get a complete layer of coverage.",
        "Choose a translucent powder to set your makeup for a natural day look.",
        "If you're doing a night look, pick a powder that matches your skin tone for additional coverage.",
        "However, using a powder that's your skin tone can create a heavy look.",
        "Refrain from dusting powder all over with rapid motions.",
        "You might smudge some of the foundation or concealer you just carefully placed.",
        "Place highlighter strategically onto smooth areas of your skin.",
        "Although luminous products won\u2019t provide good coverage for scarred areas, a dash of fluid or powder highlighter can restore a glow to your matte face.",
        "The trick is to place highlighter sparingly on smooth parts of your skin.",
        "It will help your favorite features stand out while drawing attention away from the scarring.",
        "Try dotting highlighter along the tops of your cheekbones, above your browbone, or at the tip of your nose.",
        "You can also dab it in your inner eye and across your lid.",
        "Finish your look with a setting spray.",
        "A long-lasting setting spray will lock your makeup into place all day and all night.",
        "That is, until you completely remove your makeup with a cleanser or makeup removing wipe.",
        "You can actually use setting spray in lieu of powder if your skin tends to dry out.",
        "However, a pigmented powder will add an extra layer of coverage."
