Pull off the triangular cap at the tip of the roller to uncover the glue tape, then set the lid aside in a safe spot where you won\u2019t lose it. There are several brands and models of glue tape rollers, but they basically all consist of an oval-shaped roller with a triangular tip, which you use to dispense the glue tape. You can get both permanent and peelable glue tape. To remove peelable glue tape, you simply scratch up 1 end of it with your fingernail until you can grab it, then peel it away."
