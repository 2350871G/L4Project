                    "description": "Since it takes about 15-20 minutes for most ovens to come all the way up to temperature, it\u2019s a good idea to preheat the oven before you start baking. This is also a good time to prepare your cake pan. Spray a 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) pan with non-stick cooking spray or put a little vegetable oil on a paper towel and wipe it across the bottom and sides to coat it thoroughly. Greasing the pan will keep the cake from sticking when it bakes."

Once the cake is completely cooled and you\u2019ve prepared the strawberries and the whipped cream, turn the cake out onto a flat surface. Use a serrated knife to cut off the crispy edges from all around the cake. If it\u2019s difficult to work with the whole cake in one piece, you can cut the cake into quarters. Cut 10 heart shapes out of the cake. Using a 2 in (5.1 cm) heart-shaped cookie cutter, press out 10 hearts. You may need to alternate directions in order to get enough of the shapes from the cake.

You should have enough cake to make 5 servings. Spread about 1/5 of the strawberries and juice onto each bottom cake.

        "Stir in 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of lemon juice.",
        "After you\u2019ve added all of the egg yolks, pour in about 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of lemon juice.",
        "This will add a brightness that will accentuate the strawberry flavor in the finished cake.",
        "You can use fresh lemon juice or you can use the bottled kind sold in supermarkets, as long as it\u2019s 100% pure lemon juice.",
        "Alternate adding the dry mixture with the milk and food coloring.",
        "Pour about 1/4 of the flour mixture that you prepared earlier into the sugar, butter, and eggs that you creamed together.",
        "Mix this thoroughly, then add about \u20444 cup (59 mL) of milk and blend it as well.",
        "Continue alternating the dry ingredients, then the milk, until you\u2019ve added all of both.",
        "Set the batter aside.",
        "If you want to add food coloring, pour it in along with one of the additions of milk.",
        "You can use \u20444  tsp (1.2 mL) if you want a pale pink cake, or as much as \u20442  tsp (2.5 mL) if you want your cake to be a brighter color.",
        "Whip the egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.",
        "Pour your 4 egg whites into a very clean glass or metal bowl along with 1/4 tsp (.08 g) of cream of tartar.",
        "Beat the egg whites on medium speed with your electric mixer, or use a rotary beater if you\u2019re mixing them by hand.",
        "Stop often and scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.",
        "Continue mixing until you can lift the mixer out of the bowl and the egg whites have a peak that stands straight up.",
        "If there is any residue inside the bowl, or if there\u2019s even a little egg yolk in your egg whites, the whites won\u2019t whip properly.",
        "Fold the egg whites into your cake batter.",
        "Pour the egg whites on top of the cake batter.",
        "Then, use your rubber spatula or wooden spoon to gently scoop the batter over the egg whites, being sure to scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl.",
        "Mix everything until it\u2019s just combined together.",
        "This might take several minutes, but be patient.",
        "Whipping the egg whites adds air into them, which creates a lighter, fluffier cake.",
        "However, if you mix the batter too much, you\u2019ll deflate the egg whites and end up with a dense cake.",
        "Pour the batter into your greased 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) cake pan.",
        "Once everything\u2019s combined, use your wooden spoon or spatula to gently spoon the batter into the cake pan you prepared earlier.",
        "Spread the batter out as evenly as possible across the bottom of the pan.",
        "Bake for 30-35 minutes at 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C).",
        "Place the cake pan in your preheated oven and let it bake for about 30-35 minutes.",
        "When the time is up, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake.",
        "If it comes out clean, the cake is finished.",
        "If the toothpick has cake batter stuck to it, continue cooking for 2-3 minutes at a time until the cake is fully baked.",
        "Set the cake aside and let it cool for about an hour.",
        "Since you\u2019ll be cutting the cake into shapes, it\u2019s important to let it cool; otherwise, it might crumble as soon as you cut it.",
        "You\u2019ll also end up with more crumbs if you try to cut a warm cake.Tip: If you have one, placing the baking sheet on a wire rack will help the cake cool faster.",
        "Preparing the Whipped Cream and Strawberries Combine 2 lb (0.91 kg) of strawberries with sugar and lemon juice.",
        "Pour your strawberries into a bowl, then add 2 tbsp (24 g) of sugar and the juice from about 1/2 of a lemon, which is about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of lemon juice.",
        "Use a wooden spoon to gently mix those together until the strawberries are coated, and set the bowl to the side.",
        "This is called maceration, and it softens and sweetens the strawberries.",
        "Whip heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and almond extract.",
        "Pour 2 cups (470 mL) of heavy whipping cream into a mixing bowl, along with 1/4 cup (31 g) of powdered sugar and \u20442  tsp (2.5 mL) almond extract.",
        "Whip the mixture with your electric mixture or a whisk until it\u2019s light and fluffy.",
        "Here, you\u2019re looking for soft peaks when you lift the mixer.",
        "Don\u2019t mix the cream long enough to get stiff peaks.",
        "This will create an almond-flavored whipped cream that\u2019s perfect for this strawberry cake!",
        "Chill the whipped cream until you're ready to assemble the cake.",
        "If you keep the whipped cream at room temperature, it may start to weep and deflate.",
        "To avoid this, place the bowl into the refrigerator once you\u2019ve finished whipping it.",
        "If you need to, you can whisk the whipped cream for a few minutes to revive it when it comes out of the fridge.",
        "Assembling the Cake Trim the edges off the cooled cake with a serrated knife.",
        "Once the cake is completely cooled and you\u2019ve prepared the strawberries and the whipped cream, turn the cake out onto a flat surface.",
        "Use a serrated knife to cut off the crispy edges from all around the cake.",
        "If it\u2019s difficult to work with the whole cake in one piece, you can cut the cake into quarters.",
        "Cut 10 heart shapes out of the cake.",
        "Using a 2 in (5.1 cm) heart-shaped cookie cutter, press out 10 hearts.",
        "You may need to alternate directions in order to get enough of the shapes from the cake.",
        "For instance, if your first heart piece is right-side up, you may want to turn the cookie cutter upside-down on the next piece in order to waste less cake.Tip: If your heart-shaped cookie cutter is larger or smaller, adjust the number of heart shapes accordingly.",
        "Place one of the heart-shaped slices in the bottom of each bowl.",
        "When you\u2019re ready to serve this sweet, pretty treat, place a heart-shaped piece of cake in the bottom of each person\u2019s bowl.",
        "You should have enough cake to make 5 servings.",
        "Spread about 1/5 of the strawberries and juice onto each bottom cake.",
        "Use a large spoon to pour the strawberries and juice onto the heart-shaped cake in the bottom of the bowl.",
        "The amount you\u2019ll use will depend on how much the strawberries broke down during the maceration process, but it\u2019s fine to just eyeball it.",
        "Top the strawberries with whipped cream and sprinkles.",
        "Just like with the strawberries, you don\u2019t have to be exact with the measurements.",
        "Simply scoop a generous spoonful of whipped cream on top of the cake and strawberries, then add red, white, and pink sprinkles for decorations.",
        "You can use as many or as few sprinkles as you like, or you can leave them off altogether if you don\u2019t want to add them.",
        "Top the dessert with a second heart-shaped cake piece.",
        "Once you\u2019ve added strawberries, whipped cream, and sprinkles to each serving, finish this sweet dessert by adding another heart-shaped cake piece on top of the bowl.",
        "Then, serve the cake to your family and friends, and enjoy!",
        "Refrigerate any leftovers.",
        "However, for best results, don\u2019t assemble the cake until you\u2019re ready to eat it.",
        "Otherwise, the cake will get soggy."
