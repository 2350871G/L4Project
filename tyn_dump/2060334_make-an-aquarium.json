        "If you have 1/4\" inch thick glass, your side pieces should be 1/2\" in shorter (to account for the 1/4\" on either side).",
        "Prep the glass.",
        "First, use acetone or rubbing alcohol on the sides of the glass.",
        "You want all the edges to be clean as can be.",
        "Then cut strips of masking or duct tape that are about half the length of one side.",
        "Stick half of each strip on the bottom of the bottom pane in every direction.",
        "The other half of the strip should be lying freely on the table.",
        "Then when you put up the sides, you'll grab the other half of the strip and tape it on, giving support to each side of the tank.",
        "You may want three pieces of tape on each side \u2013 on the left, right, and center of each pane.",
        "Assembling Your Aquarium Apply the silicone.",
        "Start with the bottom piece, applying a thin and continuous strip of silicone along the top, about 2mm away from the edge (where the front pane of glass will rest on it).",
        "The strip of silicone should be about 3mm in diameter.",
        "If you're not used to using a caulk gun, practice beforehand making even lines on something else, like newspaper or cardboard.",
        "When you go to cut the top of the tube, aim for a 3mm opening to control the size of your output.",
        "Be sure to work quickly; silicone sets in 2-3 minutes.",
        "Put the front pane in place.",
        "With the strip of silicone along the front edge of the base, place the front piece of glass into place, pressing it down firmly but gently.",
        "Hold it there briefly, adhere the rest of the tape up the sides, and it should stay up.",
        "If you're worried about it falling over, you can prop it up with a large container filled with water or some other heavy object.",
        "Don't wipe off the excess silicone just yet.",
        "You can take care of it after it's cured.",
        "Begin assembling the sides.",
        "With your caulk gun in hand, run another thin line of silicone (again, 2mm from the edge), along the sides.",
        "Then repeat along the inside edge of the front pane (remember: the side pieces are fitting not only into the bottom, but sandwiched in between the front and back).",
        "Press the first side piece into place, firmly but gently.",
        "You should now have one corner of your aquarium put together it.",
        "Try to avoid realigning the piece \u2013 if you do, you could create bubbles in the silicone, leading to leaking later on.",
        "Repeat this for the other side, too.",
        "Finish with the back pane of glass.",
        "Now that you're getting the hang of the caulk gun, run your last 3mm-wide lines of silicone along the edge of the bottom pane (2mm from the edge) and along the inside edges of the back panel.",
        "Press it firmly, yet gently, into place.",
        "Lift up the tape to support and prop as needed.",
        "Allow the silicone to dry and set.",
        "Most types of silicone dry within 24-48 hours.",
        "It will harden even more as time goes on, so if you can resist, don't fill it with water for a good week or so.",
        "Setting Up the Inside Test the seals.",
        "Before you go about assembling a masterpiece in your aquarium, it's best to see if your craftsmanship holds up.",
        "Fill the tank with a few inches of water.",
        "Let it sit a minute.",
        "If it doesn't leak, continue on with assembly.",
        "If it does leak, empty the aquarium immediately.",
        "Let it dry, and then reseal the problem areas.",
        "You may also want to assume there are problems near the top too, and fix those as well.",
        "Set up a filter system if need be.",
        "If you're dealing with freshwater fish, you'll need a filtering system.",
        "The most common choices are undergravel filters or power filters and they're easily hung on the back of the tank.",
        "If you're using an undergravel water filter, keep in mind the size of your aquarium.",
        "A large aquarium requires a large filter.",
        "The air pump needs to work for the entirety of the tank; not just the area it's immediately place in.",
        "A power filter should circulate 5 gallons (18.9 L) of water per hour [gph] and per gallon of your tank's capacity.",
        "An 8 gallon (30.3 L) tank would need a power filter that can handle 40 gph.",
        "Follow the specific instructions on your filter's packaging.",
        "Regardless of your model, do not turn it on until the tank is filled with water and ready to go.",
        "If necessary, add a heater.",
        "This goes on the inside of your tank and is usually attached with suction cups.",
        "It should be placed near the filter where water is constantly moving (so the temperature remains consistent throughout).",
        "Just like the filter, don't turn it on until everything is good to go.",
        "Try to keep it to 3-5 watts of heat per gallon of water, in general.",
        "However, different fish do have different preferences; because of this, an adjustable, fully-submersible heater will be the easiest to use.",
        "Remember that lights often produce heat and can interfere with your intended temperature.",
        "If this is an issue for you, there are lights available that don't heat up \u2013 and they're much better for fish.",
        "Fill your aquarium with gravel, sand, or whatever your creatures require.",
        "Most fish will be good with either gravel or sand, and any pet store will offer you a plethora of choices when it comes to texture and color.",
        "Whatever you use, 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) should be plenty.",
        "Gravel does need to be washed before placing it into the aquarium.",
        "It has a tendency to acquire dust, which is something you do not want in your water.",
        "Add in a few inches of water (if applicable) and your decorations.",
        "Everything will be easier to place (and it will stay in place) if you work with a few inches of water in your aquarium.",
        "Hopefully this time there won't be any leaks!",
        "Adjust as necessary, accounting for the weight of the water where need be.",
        "Once you have the terrain all set up, fill the aquarium all of the way up.",
        "Most people recommend a gap of about 1\" or so from the top, though this is ultimately up to you \u2013 some prefer not to see a water line at all.",
        "For freshwater fish, add water dechlorinator and cycle your tank.",
        "Fish do the opposite of thrive in tap water, thanks to chemicals in it like chlorine.",
        "On the dechlorinator packaging, it should tell you how much is appropriate to use for your size of tank.",
        "You may also want to use a bacterial catalyst like SafeStart, which will speed up the growth of good bacteria in your aquarium.",
        "Once that's in, you'll need to do a fishless cycle to monitor the water parameters (pH, High pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate).",
        "Get an aquarium testing kit and wait for the numbers to spike and lower to 0.",
        "When this happens, it's time to add your fish.",
        "An ammonia remover may be useful if the levels are too high.",
        "What's more, as time progresses, you should change 15% of the water routinely to keep it fresh and clean."
