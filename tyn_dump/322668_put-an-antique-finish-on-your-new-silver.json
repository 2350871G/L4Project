Boil the eggs for 10 minutes before removing them from the heat source. If you are going to be finishing a large piece or multiple pieces of silver, you will need more eggs. Set the eggs aside to cool. You can pour out most of the boiling water and add cool water to speed the process."

Dry your silver pieces well to make sure that there is no lingering water in the crevices of the silver. The purpose of washing the pieces is to remove oils that can prevent the silver from oxidizing.

Without peeling your eggs, add them to the bag, leaving enough room for the eggs to move around some. Ideally, the eggs should not be piled on top of each other because that will make it hard for you to mash them. If you have a lot of eggs because you are doing multiple pieces, then you can use more than one bag.
