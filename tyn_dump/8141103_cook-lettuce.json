        "Then, using a sharp kitchen knife, cut your two heads of lettuce into quarters.",
        "Spread the quarters onto a clean serving dish and drizzle each quarter with olive oil to lightly coat each one.",
        "The olive oil will help your seasoning stick to the lettuce, so this is the perfect time to add salt, pepper, or other seasonings to your lettuce.",
        "Heat your grill.",
        "First check your grill to make sure it has gas and that its equipment is hooked up correctly.",
        "A loose hose can cause a dangerous gas leak.",
        "After that, set your grill to a medium heat and allow 5 to 10 minutes for the grill to heat up.",

        "While it cooks, turn it often with a spatula or pair of tongs.",

        "This often takes about 12 minutes of grilling.",

        "Remove your lettuce and season it.",
        "Using a pair of tongs or a spatula, take your lettuce from the grill and return it to your serving plate.",

        "Over top this, sprinkle 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar.",
        "The remaining heat in your lettuce should cause the cheese to melt atop it.",
        "If your lettuce has cooled too much, you might return it to the grill for a moment or melt the cheese in your microwave.",
        "Allow to cool and enjoy.",
        "Following a few minutes of cooling time, your grilled lettuce will be ready to eat.",

        "Braising Lettuce Assemble the necessaries for braising.",
        "This particular recipe involves placing your braised lettuce on a toasted piece of bread.",

        "Depending on the size of your bread and leaves of lettuce, you may want to halve your leaves.",

        "Leaves that are too large might not fit easily atop your bread.",
        "Slice and toast your bread, if necessary.",
        "You may have bought your ciabatta or peasant bread pre-toasted, in which case you won't need to slice or toast it.",
        "Otherwise, you'll need to cut the bread with a kitchen knife and toast it either in a toaster or toaster oven.",
        "Coat a hot pan in olive oil.",
        "Put your pan on the cook top and set the temperature to medium-high.",

        "Add your lettuce to the pan.",
        "Use a kitchen utensil, like a spatula or spoon, to apply pressure to the stalks in the center of the leaves.",
        "The more contact between the leaves and your pan, the better the braising will be.",
        "Braise lettuce leaves at 1 - 2 minute intervals and flip the leaves with a spatula after each interval.",
        "After your first flip is the ideal time to season your leaves.",
        "Have your salt and pepper on hand so you're ready to season.",
        "Add your chicken stock or broth to the pan.",
        "But first, use your spatula or a spoon to remove the lettuce from your pan and set it on a spare plate.",
        "Add \u00bc cup of chicken stock or vegetable broth to the pan, and bring it to a boil.",
        "To make a richer braising mixture, you could also add to it: \u00bc cup white wine, \u00bc teaspoon of garlic powder, \u00bc teaspoon of red pepper flakes, \u00bc teaspoon of dried oregano, and \u00bc teaspoon of pepper.",
        "Finish braising in the heated broth.",
        "Lower heat until the chicken stock/broth is at a simmer.",
        "Add your lettuce to the pan, cover it with a lid, and allow it to cook for about 7 minutes.",
        "After that, remove the lid and flip each with a spatula or spoon.",

        "When the lettuce is done, transfer it to some paper towel to cool and absorb excess oil.",
        "Spread your cheese over the top of your toasted pieces of bread.",
        "Then fold each leaf in half and top each piece of bread with a leaf.",
        "Your braised lettuce is ready to eat."
