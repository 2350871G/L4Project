The safest and easiest way to defrost ribs is to put them in the refrigerator 2-4 days before you want to cook them. Using this method, the ribs will take 1 day for every 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of meat to defrost. Defrost ribs in a few hours using a cold water bath. Fill a bowl or the sink with cold water. Submerge the ribs completely in the water in their original packaging or an airtight plastic bag. Add cold water as needed to keep the temperature around 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C). Using this method, the ribs will take 30 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg) to defrost. Rinse the defrosted ribs in cool water. Unwrap the ribs and run them under cool water. This will get rid of any bone bits or debris left over from butchering. Trim the membrane from the underside of the ribs. The membrane is a paper-thin layer on the bone side of the ribs. Many times, your ribs will already be skinned of their membrane. If not, insert a butter knife between the bone and the membrane to create separation. It should come away easily, but use a sharper knife if it doesn't. Then, use your hands to pull the membrane off of the bones. Leaving membrane on the ribs will result in a tough, rubbery texture.

Put the ribs in a covered container and refrigerate them for 2-24 hours. Allow at least 2 hours for the marinade to absorb into the meat, or up to 24 hours for the most flavor. Keep the ribs moist by adding more marinade about every 3 hours. Always marinate meat in the fridge and do not reuse leftover marinade.
