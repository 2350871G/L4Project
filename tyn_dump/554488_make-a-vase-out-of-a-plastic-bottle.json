Find where the bottle starts curving and place the tip of a utility knife just below that. Then cut around the bottle in a straight line until you come back to the starting point and the top of the bottle detaches. Try to keep the cut as level as possible, but don\u2019t worry if you curve a little bit. You can even out the line in the next step. If you need a smaller vase, you can also cut the bottle at the lower point. Be very careful cutting the bottle. Keep your fingers away from the blade and always cut away from your body."
