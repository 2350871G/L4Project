Are there multiple races, like fish lizards and sentient octopods wandering around? What conflicts occur between different races? Make a famous person! You could also write a history of that person.

For example, Lilithopia has a nice sound to it, especially if it's a pretty world, filled with flowers. Zachtopia, maybe not so much! But if you dropped the \"...topia\" bit, and called it \"Zakchan,\" or even just \"Zakh,\" you have a good start. You could just say some random cool sounding thing. (Kaiu, Mikvar, etc.) Maybe even a play on words. (Guess what a Catacloyapa would be like). Names of cities in foreign countries can be used well. For example, Ravonik or Turan, from Albania. Make the name of your world reflect the inhabitants. For example, if it's a warlike world, calling your planet \"Bliss\" might not be so good. On the other hand, if your world is populated by unicorns and elves, calling it \"Kzrakh\" would not work at all. Create different countries! Design flags for each country, give it a unique name, and create the culture and customs that are both unique to them, and common to all the cultures of your world."

        "Add technical boundaries.",
        "Much like Europe and Asia, they are separate continents whose boundaries are defined by nature.",
        "Add political boundaries: these are countries, states, and cities.",
        "Take a look at Google Maps to see how these things are handled, and use that as a guide.",
        "Start naming your places.",
        "Once you have the borders of your country defined, start adding names.",
        "Work your way down from big to small, as the there will be few large features, and many small.",
        "Name your major features first: continents, oceans, deserts, forests, etc.",
        "Give each country a capital city.",
        "Locate and name major cities, then the names of countries, provinces, continents, oceans, deserts, forests, etc.",
        "This may seem overwhelming, but just relax and don't think about anything, just let the ideas flow.",
        "There's no rush.",
        "You can put it all in an imaginary box in your mind, or write notes down on paper.",
        "Search for \"random fantasy name generator\" on Google if you can't think of as many as you need.",
        "Names that often have a double vowel in them ('ee', 'oo', etc.)",
        "often sound more foreign and interesting.",
        "Names are also better if you make them longer and have more than one syllable.",
        "Draw a rough sketch of your map.",
        "Exclude small islands to begin with.",
        "Make sure to make the borders of the landmasses are jagged (like coastlines), not smooth and curvy (unless you have a very good, in-your-world reason for doing this, not just because you're lazy).",
        "It helps to use a computer because it is easier to edit than on paper.",
        "Add the small islands.",
        "Remember, these islands can be made to be very important,  economically and strategically.",
        "Add a map key.",
        "Use simple symbols like triangles for mountains and dots for cities (unless you're a bit of an artist, and you like drawing the mountains beautifully and drawing tiny little houses and castles for the cities).",
        "Then fill in the place names.",
        "Be sure to make continent names in a larger size than country names, country names larger than city names, etc.",
        "Don't forget to adjust the size of your city symbols and make a different symbol for capitals, countries and provinces.",
        "Color your map.",
        "This can be done any way you want, tweak it slightly, and voila!",
        "You have your map.",
        "Create individual maps of countries.",
        "To do this you want the nearby countries to be grey or sepia-colored.",
        "Then color each province a different bright color.",
        "Of course, if no countries exist (i.e you have a very early world, or one ravaged by war, or a peaceful, John-Lennon-Imagine kind of place), then you don't have to do this step.",
