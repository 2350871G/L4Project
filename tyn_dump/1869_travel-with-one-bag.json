            "headline": "Choose a bag.",
            "description": "Your choice will evolve as you consider what you need to bring and how you prefer to carry it. Here are some things to consider:\nSize: The largest dimensions that your airline will allow as a carry-on is a good starting point. If you can fit what you need into a smaller bag, doing so may allow you to travel more comfortably, and give you more options when storing the bag in the overhead compartments or under the seat in front of you. Weight:  Some airlines weigh carry-on bags before you board, so try to make sure that most of the weight comes from what's inside, and not from the bag itself. Avoid the need for expensive extra-light materials (such as the ridiculously priced titanium luggage) by choosing a bag made of rip-stop nylon. Avoid heavy and bulky extending handles and wheels and opt instead for a bag with a strap. For the most comfortable carrying option for the least weight for most people, choose a bag with backpack straps and a hip belt. Big, easy to carry, durable and modestly priced bags are especially important to soldiers. Try a \"giant duffle [sic] backpack\" from a \"tactical\" store for checked baggage (the cylindrical girth and somewhat bigger length maximizes permitted volume, and the stowable backpack straps preserve mobility); or a maximum-carryon-sized boxy-shaped backpack. The color selection may be limited, but black is generally available and may helpfully avoid a military appearance in travel out of of one's own country. Storage:  Multiple pockets help keep things organized, at the expense of a little added weight. Pockets accessible from the outside provide convenient access to travel paraphernalia such as an inflatable neck pillow or other sleeping aids and snacks, without unpacking or rummaging through everything else. Extra space:  You may benefit from leaving a little room for extra items, such as souvenirs and purchases. Pliable bags, such as duffels, are a good choice for this: they can be cinched down when less than full, and expanded when you want to take advantage of the extra room. A packable nylon or light synthetic canvas shoulder bag that folds into a little pouch is a great backup to have on hand in case you decide or happen to accumulate souvenirs. Choose a size within your airline's \"personal item\" carry-on limits to bring it on the plane with you, or check it in on your return trip."

            "headline": "Determine which items are really necessary.",
            "description": "Ask yourself what you need to function day-to-day, or which items will dramatically improve your traveling experience. At the relevant destination, could any item be feasibly rented, borrowed or bought (and not kept to bring back)? Gather only the minimum essentials. Here's a short list of items that you might need to bring:\nThree changes of clothing (at most). Perhaps more socks, underwear and shirts than pants. (Consider packing synthetic fabrics, which are lighter, fold up smaller, slide past each other readily rather than distorting piles, and dry faster\u2013\u2013especially for pants, where any difference in feel is less noticeable.) Toiletries, such as a toothbrush, floss, soap, shampoo, razors, and anything else you need for grooming. See below for more information about packing toiletries. Medical items that you currently require, such as medication, bandages or eyeglasses. Any charge cords or other accessories you need for your phone, laptop, or other electronic items. Shoes, if you'll need a pair besides your traveling shoes. Empty plastic bags. You can put dirty clothes in them until washing to keep them from contaminating the clean ones. They should be clear so they aren't confused with trash and thrown away. Try produce bags. Laundry detergent for washing by hand. Put a few scoops of powdered detergent in a plastic sandwich bag if you're going on an airplane. An inexpensive, lightweight, and long-lasting alternative is to carry a bar of laundry soap. A portable clothesline (available at any camping or travel goods store). A universal sink stopper (a flat rubber disk, available at any hardware store), to help with hand-washing laundry. A rubber ball can be an alternative, but check that it doesn't tend to float and is large enough so as to not risk falling in."

            "description": "A search for \"packing methods\" will turn up several videos showing different techniques. Here are a few:\nThe bundle method. Wrap clothes around large and/or semi-delicate objects (such as bags of toiletries, pairs of shoes, or electronics), rather than folding or rolling clothes. Stuff underwear and socks into shoes to save space and to prevent crushing shoes. The bundle method saves space and also reduces wrinkling. The rolling method. Roll each item of clothing into a tight cylinder. This saves space and minimizes wrinkles. See how to roll clothes for details. Combine rolling and folding. See How to Pack Clothes in a Backpack for more information."

            "headline": "Choose your toiletries.",
            "description": "Buy toiletries in miniature sizes, or transfer liquid contents like shampoo into smaller travel bottles. You can buy travel-size toiletries at most big-box stores, or simply save the small ones you get at hotels. Remember that for carry-on air travel, your airline will require all liquids to fit inside a single plastic bag. Check your airline's carry-on rules for size specifications. Put toiletries that could leak (shampoo, gel, etc.) in individual plastic bags to avoid mess. If you use bar soap (which can substitute for other forms of soap such as shampoo and shaving cream), get a ventilated holder for it so it doesn't turn to mush through use and storage. For quicker trips through airport security, try to use solids rather than liquids. Shampoo is available in solid soap-block form and even single-use sheets. Check at a backpacking or outdoor store for more options. Save extra space by omitting common inexpensive items like body soap and shampoo, and purchase them instead when you reach your destination."
