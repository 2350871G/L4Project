        "Set a medium saucepan on high heat and pour in a large amount of water.",
        "If you\u2019re trying to make sour cherries, stir 2\u00bd cups (500 g) of white sugar into the water.",
        "If you\u2019re aiming to make sweeter cherries, add 1\u00bc cups (250 g) of sugar into the pot.",
        "Continue stirring until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture has a thick consistency.",
        "This recipe works best for large quantities of cherries.",
        "Add 0.5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of ascorbic acid to the syrup.",
        "Pour a small amount of ascorbic acid into each 1.5 pounds (680 g) and stir it in thoroughly.",
        "While you don\u2019t have to include this ingredient, you can use it to help your cherries look as fresh as possible while they\u2019re drenched in syrup.",
        "Check online or in your local grocery store to purchase this.",
        "Place cherries in a freezer-safe jar or bag.",
        "Pour your washed and pitted cherries into a storage bag or glass jar, leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the top for the syrup.",
        "If you don\u2019t, there might not be enough room for the syrup to cover all of the cherries.",
        "Pour the cooled syrup into the bag so all of the cherries are covered.",
        "Wait for the syrup to cool before adding it to the cherries.",
        "Once you\u2019ve opened the bag or jar, pour the syrup into the container so that all of the fruit is completely drenched and the bag is almost completely filled with syrup.",
        "Leave about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of space at the top of the container so you can seal it without any syrup spilling over.",
        "Be sure to seal the bag or jar so that no air or moisture can get in.",
        "Freeze and use the cherries within 12 months.",
        "Place a label on the storage container before placing it in the freezer so you can remember how fresh the fruit is.",
        "While you don\u2019t have to use the cherries right away, try and eat them within a year.",
        "If you wait too long, the fruit might not be as fresh.",
        "Use freezer-safe tape to label your cherry containers.",
        "Packing the Cherries in Sugar Place 1.5 pounds (680 g) of cherries into a large bowl.",
        "Take your washed cherries and set them in a container so you can pour in additional ingredients more easily.",
        "If you\u2019re preparing a large amount of cherries at once, consider preparing them in batches.",
        "Make sure you know what type of cherries you\u2019re preserving, as the process for sweet and sour fruit is slightly different.",
        "Add sugar to the cherries and let it dissolve.",
        "If you\u2019re looking to preserve 1.5 pounds (680 g) of sour cherries, take \u2154 cup (132 g) of white sugar and pour it into the bowl.",
        "For those looking to store sweet cherries, use \u2153 cup (66 g) of white sugar per 1.5 pounds (680 g).",
        "Stir the sugar into the fruit until it begins dissolving into cherries.",
        "The sugar should dissolve due to the lingering moisture from the rinsing process.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if some sugar is visible when you go to pack the cherries, as it might not end up dissolving all the way.",
        "Pour the cherries into a separate container.",
        "Arrange the sugar-soaked cherries into a freezer-safe bag or container, leaving 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of space on top so the bag to be comfortably sealed off.",
        "If you place too many cherries in 1 bag, then you might not be able to get a proper seal on the storage container.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about dumping any excess sugar into the bag, since it won\u2019t be dissolving when it\u2019s in the freezer.Tip: As a general rule of thumb, pack smaller batches of cherries with 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of extra space and larger batches with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of extra space.",
        "Use the cherries within 1 year for optimal freshness.",
        "Label the bag or jar with the type of cherry you\u2019ve preserved, as well as the current date.",
        "As you label the fruit, be sure to mention that you preserved them in a dry sugar pack.",
        "Set the container(s) in your freezer for the time being, and try to use them within 1 year.",
        "Use freezer-safe tape to add labels to your cherries."
