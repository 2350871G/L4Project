                    "description": "When you're setting up a flat lay, you'll need to find an area that's big enough to spread out your garments, like a table top or a floor. However, since the background of the flat lay is a big part of the picture, you may want to create your own backdrop by laying down a sheet of paper, fabric, poster board, or another similar item. Just make sure that any backdrop you use will extend all the way to the edge of the photo, or else it could mess up the flat lay effect.Try to match the backdrop to your style. For instance, if you're shooting a casual, feminine outfit, you might use a washed-out barn door as your backdrop. Linens and rugs can also make great backgrounds for a flat lay. If you'll be doing a lot of flat lay photography, it's a good idea to use the same or similar backdrops in most of your pictures. That way, they'll be more easily recognizable when your followers come across them."

                    "description": "Lighting is always important in photography, but shadows in a flat lay shoot can throw off the whole effect. To avoid that, try shooting near a large, open window, or set up your work station in a shady spot outdoors.Avoid setting up directly in the sunlight, since that will create harsh shadows."

                    "headline": "Use 1 or 2 external lights if natural light isn't available.",
                    "description": "If you don't have good natural lighting in your work area, the best option is to set up a controlled light source. If you only have 1 light, place it to the side of your flay lay setup, tilted at a 45\u00b0 angle. If you're using 2 lights, place them on either side or at opposing corners, facing each other and tilted at the same 45\u00b0 angle. If you want to deliberately add shadows to the shot, move the light a little further from your product. If you're using 2 lights, only move 1 of the lights. Try experimenting with different lighting options, including flash diffusers to soften your flash, reflectors to help redirect light and reduce shadows, and softboxes to create a new light source. Photography equipment can be expensive, but not all lighting solutions require a large investment. For instance, you can help diffuse shadows in your photo by holding up a large piece of white posterboard to reflect light down into the shot."

                    "description": "When you're shooting product photos, use an ISO of 200 or lower to get the clearest picture. Also, you'll get a sharper photo if you use a fast shutter speed and a higher F-stop, which will give you a smaller aperture opening. Set the white balance based on your light source. Go through the settings in your camera and adjust the white balance to match the type of lighting you're using, such as fluorescent, incandescent, tungsten, or natural. Use a standard camera lens for most flat-lay photography. Don't use a wide-angle lens, as it can distort the image."

However, you may need to stand on a step ladder or a stool so you can get high enough above the frame to shoot head-on.If you do have to climb, be careful, especially if you're carrying heavy camera equipment! It may be a good idea to have someone else nearby to hand you your camera once you get in place. Tip: If you're shooting in natural light, be sure to stand on the opposite side from your light source. Otherwise, you'll cast a shadow in your picture!"

This will give the piece a little more movement, and it will look more like it does when it's hanging naturally on a person's body.Since the back of a garment is often a little longer than the front, you may need to tuck the back bottom hem under the piece, as well. If you're styling a woman's garment, tuck in the sides a little more just beneath the arms to give the clothing a gentle curve. For men's and children's clothing, keep the line straight."
