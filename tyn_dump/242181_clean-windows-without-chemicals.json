EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tMichelle Driscoll, a cleaning expert, suggests: \"Cleaning windows on a regular basis will help reduce excess build up and grime and will be much easier to keep clean. Be sure to scrub the grime off and dry them first before your final wipe down with a microfiber cloth or newspaper. Also be sure to use a clean cloth on every window. Once any dust gets into your cloth, it can spread to another window and leave streaks. You want to avoid wiping the window frame and the window glass at the same time, as that can also transfer the debris and dust onto your window.\""
