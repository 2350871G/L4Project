You also want to take precaution not to stain your skin or clothing. You can use a drop cloth, layers of newspaper, plastic garbage bags, or a plastic table cloth. Whichever you choose, consider taping it down to your work area so that it stays in place while you complete your project, and make sure it isn\u2019t thin enough that the dye could seep through it. If you are working on a table, consider also laying a drop cloth on the floor underneath you, in case the dye splashes. Wear old clothes that you don\u2019t mind getting dye on. You can also just put a large, old T-shirt or button down over the clothes you are wearing to keep them clean. When you dye your buttons, wear rubber gloves to protect your skin."
