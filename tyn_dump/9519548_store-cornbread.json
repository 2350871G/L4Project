    "text": " Storing Cornbread at Room Temperature Wrap your cornbread in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Wrapping your cornbread will keep it from drying out. Place your cornbread in a dry, dark place. You don\u2019t want your cornbread to be exposed to moisture or direct sunlight or it could go bad sooner. Put your cornbread on a shelf in your pantry, or put it inside of a bread box if you have one. Store your cornbread at room temperature for 1-2 days. If your cornbread develops mold or a bad smell, it\u2019s gone bad and you should throw it away. Storing Cornbread in the Fridge Let your cornbread fully cool off before you store it in the fridge. Storing your cornbread in the fridge when it\u2019s still warm can cause moisture to build upon the surface, which will make it spoil faster. Wrap your cornbread in plastic wrap. Plastic wrap will keep air and moisture away from your cornbread so it lasts longer. Store your cornbread in the fridge for up to 1 week. After 1 week, your cornbread will start to lose its flavor and go bad. If you see excessive moisture or mold, your cornbread has started to spoil and you should throw it out. Eat your cornbread cold or reheat it in the oven. If you\u2019re going to reheat it, take it out of the plastic wrap and place it on a baking sheet. Put your cornbread in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Storing Cornbread in the Freezer Wait for your cornbread to fully cool off before putting it in the freezer. Putting warm cornbread in the freezer can cause moisture to build up, which will shorten the amount of time your cornbread stays fresh for. Place your cornbread in a sealable plastic freezer bag. Use plastic bags specifically designed for the freezer so your cornbread doesn\u2019t get freezer burn. Once your cornbread is in the bag, press out the excess air with your hands and seal the bag closed. Put your bagged cornbread in a hard container if your freezer is crowded. That way your cornbread won\u2019t get crushed. Make sure the container has a lid on it. Store your cornbread in the freezer for 2-3 months. Write the date on the container so you know when your cornbread is expired. Thaw your frozen cornbread before eating or reheating it. To thaw your cornbread, take the plastic freezer bag out of the freezer and put it in the fridge overnight. If you\u2019re in a rush, thaw your cornbread at room temperature for several hours. Once your cornbread is thawed, you can reheat it in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Don\u2019t eat your cornbread if you notice mold on it or if it has a bad smell.",
