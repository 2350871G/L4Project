In some cases, it may make more sense to just buy a new cable. Clean it up. If the wire has an area that is mangled, cut that area out. Determine which splicing technique you will use for splicing the small (usually 22-28 AWG) wires together. Use a technique that you feel comfortable using. As long as there is continuity through your splice, it should work. Place a long piece of larger shrink tube on one side of the split.
