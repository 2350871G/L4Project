Cover with either a cork stopper made for the hole shape or with something like muslin or cheesecloth. You may need to tie the cloth in place with string or a rubber band. Place the botijo in the shade, away from sunlight. If you live in Spain or you're vacationing there, it is usual to put the botijo out in the garden or near a window. However, it is important to always cover it under some fabric netting, to avoid any insects getting in and spoiling the water. This is probably no different wherever you live, unless you're somewhere that is miraculously hot and insect-free!"

These spouts (or \"mouths\") are known in Spanish as \"pit\u00f3n\" or \"pitorro\". It is from the spout that you consume the water.

Do not put the spout too near your lips\u2013\u2013the water has to be about 5\u20136 centimeter (2\u20132 in) (2-2.5\") distance from your lips. The botijo is meant to be shared among others and germ-sharing is not a part of the deal. Drink. Don't be surprised if it doesn't work at first; it takes a bit of skill and likely some water will spill rather than reaching your mouth. Keep practicing; it'll eventually feel natural. (And all the water spilled on you on a hot day should be a pleasant feeling!)"
