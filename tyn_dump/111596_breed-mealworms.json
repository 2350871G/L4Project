The containers need tops with tiny vents or airholes (wire mesh works, as does poking holes in the lid) that allow for airflow without letting the mealworms escape. Darkling beetles can't fly, but a lid is a safety precaution that you should have. Getting at least two (three, if you want to start a very large colony) is essential because you'll need to separate the beetles from the larvae a few weeks into the process. If you fail to separate them, they will eat one another. Do not use wooden containers, as mealworms are able to eat through these."

You can buy mealworm substrate from a feeder supply store, or you can make your own mixture from bran flakes, corn flakes, and other cereals.
