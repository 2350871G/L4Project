It is up to you. If you decide to fold the blanket over, fold 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of material over on each of the 4 sides of the blanket and insert pins into the folded fabric to hold it in place. Fleece does not fray easily, so having a folded hem is not really necessary unless you like the look of a folded hem."

Consult your sewing machine\u2019s manual to find out how to set your sewing machine to the zigzag stitch setting. There should be a dial or digital control where you can select the stitch type.

Lower the presser foot and then begin sewing the zigzag stitch along the raw edges of your fabric. Go slow and hold the fabric taut as you sew. If you have folded the fabric over, then position the needle about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the folded edge. This will ensure that the needle will go right up to or just over the raw edge of the folded fabric. If you have left the fabric unfolded, then sew about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the raw edges of the fabric. If you are having trouble keeping the fabric moving evenly under your presser foot, you can place a piece of tissue paper or wax paper under the fabric and over the feed dogs. This will help to prevent it from getting caught on the feed dogs and you can tear away the paper after you finish sewing."
