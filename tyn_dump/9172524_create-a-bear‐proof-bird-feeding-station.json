        "Small hand winch - The smallest seem to be about 600# capacity; this is more than adequate. Get one with an empty reel or remove the web strap.",
        "Spool of approximately 1/8\" wire - Make sure it's one suitable for outdoor use. The length needed will be at least the distance between trees plus three times the height from the winch to the upper pulley. Since this wire often comes in 100' spools, that can handle most needs.",
        "Turning block or pulley - A small block is used to transfer the pull off the wire from vertical, to the winch, to horizontal between trees. One with a removable wheel is ideal for ease of assembly and possible maintenance. A \"single sheave fixed eye pulley\" is the precise name.",
        "Two \"Quick Links\" - These attach the picture to an eye bolts at one end and the free end of the cable to the other eyebolt",
        "Wire rope thimble - Some come with clamps. Get one for your size wire. This is used to make a loop at the wire's free end that will not fail because of stress or wear. The clamp (one is sufficient) is used to hold the thimble in the loop. Extra clamps can be attached or used for holding feeder hooks.",
        "2 shelf angle brackets - These attach the winch to a tree. These should be about 5\" to 6\" long, an inch wide, and 1/8\u201d thick to be able to bolt the winch to one arm and the tree with the other arm. Get zinc plated or stainless for outdoor use.",
        "3 to 5 cable clamps for 1/8\u201d cable - One or two are used to attach the thing. The others are used to attach hooks to hold the feeders.",
        "2 or 3 \"S\" hooks - These attach feeders to the wire. Small ones made from approximately 1/8\u201d material are strong enough and big enough. Bigger hooks need bigger cable clamps!",
        "2 eye bolts with a wood or lag screw -  Size is not critical, but something on the order of 1/4\u201d screw and 1\" eye. Get zinc or chrome plated, brass, or stainless steel for outdoor use.",

The desired height for attaching the wire should be at least 8' -- higher for wider tree spacing to allow for droop. Mount the angle brackets to the back of the winch. Keep the angle away from the handle and parallel to the drum. You may need to drill holes in the bracket to fit the winch hole pattern. Use some lag bolts to mount the winch to one tree with the direction control on the bottom.  Carefully use your ladder to put the eye bolt into the same tree as the winch.  Mount the other eye bolt in the other tree. Do this at approximately the same height as the first eye bolts. (The picture shows wire with thimble and clamp, and eye bolt. A Quick Link was not used, but is recommended.) Install the thimble in the free end of the wire using one or two cable clamps.  Use a Quick Link to connect the thimble eye to this last tree's eye bolt.  Unwind the wire completely. Thread the loose end through the pulley, or disassemble the pulley to insert the wire.
