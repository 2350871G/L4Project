        "Macadamia nuts rarely get affected by pests, but once in a while mites and other tiny insects might infect the tree.",
        "If the leaves begin to look at all damaged or eaten, spray a mixture of water and orange or chrysanthemum on the leaves.",
        "Always spot test on the leaves before spraying the whole plant so that you know the pesticide isn\u2019t harmful.",
        "Harvesting the Nuts Pick up fallen nuts as soon as you see them.",
        "The best way to tell whether macadamia nuts are ripe is to wait for them to fall on their own.",
        "Always gather the nuts as soon as you see them on the ground, and check for mold, rot, or damage caused by an animal trying to eat the nuts.",
        "You can also shake the branches to loosen almost-ripe nuts, though you will need to be careful not to damage the branches.",
        "Be aware that some of the nuts that fall when you shake the branches are likely to be unripe.",
        "Check regularly for cracks in the nuts\u2019 skins.",
        "If you plan to harvest ripe nuts just before they fall, inspect nuts on the branches for cracks in the skin.",
        "Macadamia nuts split open right before they fall, so a nut with a visible crack is most likely ready to eat.",
        "Remove the husks from your macadamia harvest.",
        "Once you have gathered your tree\u2019s macadamia nuts, you will have to husk and dry them to prevent mildew or mold from forming in the nut.",
        "Peel off the soft husk of the nut and throw it out or place it around the tree as a fertilizer.",
        "Air-dry the nuts for 2 to 3 weeks.",
        "Set the nuts in a dry place, out of the sun and out of reach from animals.",
        "Let them sit in place for between 2 and 3 weeks.",
        "Avoid touching or handling the nuts, as this can allow bacteria and moisture to get on the nuts.",
        "Try not to dry the nuts indoors unless there is nowhere to hide them from animals or the humidity is too high for them to dry.",
        "Bake the nuts at the lowest oven setting for 12 hours.",
        "After the nuts have air dried, you can get them ready to be preserved by putting them on a large, yet shallow sheet, dish, or pan in an oven set between 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) and 115 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C).",
        "Let the nuts dry in the oven for around 12 hours.",
        "Check regularly to make sure the nuts aren\u2019t burning or cooking.",
        "Never use a higher heat setting, as overheating or cooking the nuts can spoil them."
