Glycerin preserves but does not fix the appearance of flowers. Cut the flower stems diagonally across their bottoms. This increases the surface area to allow the water uptake to be plentiful. Remove the bottom leaves from the stems. If left on, these will turn murky in the water and begin to rot, which will hasten the deterioration process (and it smells bad). They're not needed, so remove them. Peel the skin from the base of the stem. Peel off around 6 centimeter (2.4 in) of the stem.

Pour the solution into the container (vase, bowl, etc.) in which the flowers will stand. Arrange the prepared flowers in the solution. Ensure that the flowers have air circulation between them; in other words, don't push them in too tightly. Enjoy longer-lasting flowers.
