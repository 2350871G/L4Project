If you have extra thick hair, separate your hair into 3 sections instead of 2. Section off the very top layer of hair, a middle layer, and then the bottom layer. Wrapping Your Hair in Foil Choose a strand of hair and work systematically around your head. To start the curling process, gather a small strand of hair. The strand of hair should be about the width of a pencil when compressed. If you've sectioned off parts of your hair, start with the bottom layer. You'll work your way from one side of your head to the other to ensure you don't miss any strands. If you haven't sectioned off your hair, choose a section of hair from the top of your head to start with. For larger curls, take a larger strand of hair.

The tighter the coil, the curlier your hair will be. Similarly, if you have a loose coil, you're going to have much looser curls. Place the foil under the rolled hair while holding the hair in place. Take a square piece of the aluminum foil and place it under the rolled up strand of hair. It\u2019s important that you hold the pin curl in place when positioning the aluminum foil to ensure that it doesn\u2019t unravel. Wrap the foil around the pin curl to keep it in place.

It\u2019s okay if the foil isn\u2019t completely flat after being wrapped. As long as the strands stay curled up, it should work. Continue wrapping pin curls in foil around your entire head. Repeat the process of winding each strand of hair up into a pin curl and then wrapping them securely in aluminum foil. If you\u2019ve sectioned off your hair, start with the bottom section and then move your way up, completing the top section of hair last. If you haven't sectioned off your hair, simply move from one side of your head to the other, making sure you wrap every strand. Heating the Curls Clamp the flat iron onto each wrapped curl for a couple seconds. After the hair straightener has heated up, clamp it around each section of foil. You only need to heat up the foil for about 5 seconds\u2014leaving it clamped around the foil for too long could damage your hair. If you have thick hair, clamp the foil for a couple seconds and then release it. Repeat this 2-4 times on 1 section of foil, making sure you don\u2019t keep it clamped for too long each time.
