Whisk on medium-high speed until you see it begin to thicken. Reduce to medium speed. If using sugar, add at this stage and whisk. Check the texture of the whipped cream. The consistency of the cream is very important in determining when it can be used as frosting:\nThe cream should be whipped until it forms soft peaks.

Add it after the consistency has reached the stage explained in the previous step. Then blend in quickly by hand. For other flavors, see below. Applying the frosting Use a turntable or rotating stand for a full size cake. Since this frosting has such a soft texture, it's easiest to apply it to the cake while the cake turns on the turntable. This reduces the mess and ensures an even, smooth application. Dollop or pour the frosting into the center of the cake.  Working from the top, smooth down the pile of cream toward the edges and sides of the cake. Turn the turntable to work on a fresh area as you finish the current area. Smooth the sides and top. Use a flexible icing spatula or round-bladed knife to quickly work over the entire frosting and leave it smooth, with tiny peaks here and there. For a cupcake: Always hold a cupcake in one hand when frosting it. Place a dollop of frosting on the top. Use a round-bladed knife to swirl the frosting around the top. Try to do this in one continuous movement. As you swirl, push the frosting to the edges of the cupcake. Leave a peaked center and a swirled edge. Storage Store cakes with whipped cream frosting in the refrigerator until serving or decorating time. If decorating with piping gel, always place in the refrigerator first, to give a firmer top. Do not leave cakes out for more than an hour when topped with whipped cream frosting. If this is likely to be a problem, consider storing half the cake in the refrigerator once it's cut, then bringing out more as needed. Other flavorings Add fresh berry puree. Puree berries or strawberries. Add about 2 1/4 cups puree for every 3 cups of cream. Add fresh fruit puree. Again, use the same amount. Make sure that the fruit flavor isn't overwhelming for the cake flavor though. Fruit juice can be used too. For example, add 1/2 cup orange or lemon juice, preferably freshly squeezed, to the cream. Add chocolate. Add 1/4 cup quality cocoa powder and 6 tablespoons (88.7 ml) of sugar to counteract the chocolate's bitterness. This one needs to sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour to allow to cocoa to dissolve properly. Finished. ",
