Ideally, you should start with jumps where you can easily see the landing as you perform the jump.Safety precaution: Always wear a full-face helmet, chest protector, and knee braces when you're riding your bike. You're bound to have a few accidents while you're learning to jump, and proper safety gear can help prevent serious injuries. If possible, watch someone else going over the jump. This will help you get an idea of how fast to approach the jump and what the landing will be like. Most step-ups and other basic jumps that you will encounter will be about 4\u20136 feet (1.2\u20131.8 m) tall."

Place the middle of your feet firmly on the foot pegs and stand with your knees slightly bent and your hips directly above the foot pegs. Bend your upper body so that it's at a roughly 45\u00b0 angle relative to the ground, and grip the handlebars with your elbows bent and sticking out to the sides. Your head should be over the handlebars. Try to squeeze the bike with your knees and calves as you approach the jump. This way, your feet are less likely to fly off the pedals, resulting in a potentially dangerous landing. Aim for a position that feels stable, but also neutral and relaxed."

As you drive up to the jump, use a smooth and controlled motion on the throttle to accelerate to the desired speed. Keep a steady grip on the throttle once you reach the desired speed and hold it through the jump. Easing off on the throttle too soon can send you into a nose-dive, while accelerating too much can cause you to enter a dangerous mid-air wheelie."

                    "description": "Learning to shift gears properly on a dirt bike takes a lot of practice\u2014you'll need to develop a sense of what gear works best by experimenting and listening to the sound of your motor. In general, staying in a low gear (such as 3rd) works best when approaching jumps, since it increases your engine's rotations per minute and makes the bike more responsive. To upshift, briefly let off on the throttle and squeeze the clutch while you push up on the gear shift peg with your foot. To shift down, push the peg down with your foot. In some situations, you might find it helpful to shift in the air during a jump. For example, if you're landing on a straight path after a jump, shifting up in midair can help the bike move ahead more smoothly. If you have to take a turn right after jumping, shift down in the air so the bike decelerates slightly before the turn. Don't use the clutch or the gas while shifting in midair."

                    "description": "A smooth, safe landing is an important part of any jump. As you land, squeeze tightly with your knees to help keep you stable and ensure that your legs absorb most of the impact (as opposed to your back, arms, or wrists). Keep your wrists straight and continue to hold your elbows out to the side to help distribute the shock evenly through your arms and upper body. Whether you should land on your front or back wheel will depend partially on the nature of the jump, but aim for a good balance between the 2. Accelerate slightly just before you land to help keep your bike in a straight line."

For a back-wheel landing from a relatively low height, you can crouch over the tank and down on the bars just before landing to balance out the wheels.
