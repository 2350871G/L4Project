For best results, use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment. Run the vacuum over the chair, making sure to get into dust between the cushions and in any cracks or crevices. Once you finish, wipe the chair down with a cloth. Use either a cotton or microfiber cloth. Keep an eye out for problem areas when vacuuming and dusting.

Soaps you would use in the shower work well as long as they're of a mild variety. If possible, use distilled water over tap water.
