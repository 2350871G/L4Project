Some types of wood have greater concentrations of tannins than others, though. These include cedar, pine, red oak, redwood, and mahogany, among others. Woods that are harder and darker have more tannins. The concentration of tannins varies from tree to tree\u2014this means that 2 cedar boards may age differently when treated with baking soda. Consider these differences and imperfections part of the aging process. You can use baking soda on woods with low concentrations of tannins, but the results will be much less noticeable.

Scrub hard enough to brush away all of the baking soda paste, and press even harder if you want to scuff up the wood and add to the aged look. Some of the wood may flake off as you scrub.
