Fusing\nRuler\nChalk or marker\nScissors\nSewing machine\nThe item you want to have a welt pocket. Cut out two large rectangles of the pocket fabric. You will need to cut out rectangles that are large enough to cover the width and length of your entire pocket. Make sure to cut the rectangles to the same size. Also, consider the size of your garment and how big you want the pockets to be.

For example, if you are planning a pocket that is 4 inches (10 cm) wide, then cut two strips that are 5 inches (12.7 cm) by 2 inches (5 cm). Creating the Pocket Opening Draw two parallel lines on one piece of fusing. When you have all of your material and fusing cut out, you will need to draw two parallel lines on one piece of your fusing. The lines should be the desired width of your pocket opening.

Make sure that the material is neatly folded and tucked under to form a long rectangular opening. Fold down the short end of the fabric and iron.
