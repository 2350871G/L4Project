Latik is made from coconut curds, which separate from the fat.

You can also make coconut milk from fresh or shredded coconut. To make coconut cream, follow the same recipe, but use 4 parts coconut meat to one part water.

Let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until it thickens. This takes about an hour. Keep heating until the curds and oil separate. Once most of the liquid has evaporated, the coconut cream will separate into two parts: oil and curds. Keep heating it as this happens, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Let the curds fry at low heat. Leave the curds and oil in the pan and reduce the heat to low. Stop stirring until the oil begins to fry the curds, turning them golden-brown. Once they start to change color, stir occasionally so they cook evenly. Turn off the heat. The latik will continue to cook for a few minutes, turning a deep brown color. Drain the coconut oil out. Pour the mixture through a mesh to separate the solid latik from the coconut oil. Serve on top of ube halaya. You can use the oil instead of butter in the ube halaya, or brush it on top once the halaya is finished. Sprinkle the latik on top of the ube halaya before serving\nStore latik in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one month. Store coconut oil in an airtight container away from light and heat. It should last for at least a few months either in or out of the refrigerator, but homemade coconut oil may have traces of curds that cause it to spoil faster.",
