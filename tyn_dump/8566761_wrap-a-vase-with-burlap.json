                    "description": "For this type of project, it will be best to use a simple rounded vase or candle holder that\u2019s roughly the same width from top to bottom. This will allow the burlap to wrap tighter and lay flat against the body of the vase. Spruce up an old, unused vase that you\u2019ve had in storage to instantly revitalize it. Shop around for a new vase that\u2019s just the right shape and size for the design you have in mind."

Unwind the rest of the roll and guide it around the vase until it meets the loose end. Pull the burlap taut to prevent it from sliding down the vase. If the vase you\u2019re using is curved or tapered, line up the edges of the burlap as best as you can and trim any corners that stick out.

Make sure both edges are straight and in line with one another. You may need to trim or iron the crimped edge of the burlap roll before you get started. Overlapping the edges of the burlap will also make it easier to glue them down."

Hold the edges together until the glue is dry. You can also glue the strip of burlap directly to the vase itself.
