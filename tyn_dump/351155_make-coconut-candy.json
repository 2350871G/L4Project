Combine the sugar, water and corn syrup in a saucepan. Place the saucepan over a medium heat and stir continuously until the sugar dissolves. Bring the contents of the saucepan to the boil.

Once the mixture reaches 240 \u00b0F (116 \u00b0C), add the butter and stir until it's melted and combined. Allow the mixture to continue boiling (without stirring) until it reaches 260 \u00b0F (127 \u00b0C). Remove from the heat and add remaining ingredients. Once the mixture reaches 260 \u00b0F (127 \u00b0C), remove the saucepan from the heat and add in the shredded coconut, baking soda and salt, stirring well to combine. The mixture may foam a little at this point. Pour the coconut mixture into the prepared cake tray. Use a spatula to smooth the mixture into an even layer, then leave to set for several hours at room temperature. Once set, cut into small squares and enjoy!

Combine these ingredients in a large bowl until they form a sticky mixture. Use your hands to divide the mixture into 1 inch (2.5 cm) balls, then place them on a greased cookie sheet and leave to chill in the refrigerator for approximately 20 minutes. Melt the chocolate chips. While the coconut candies are chilling, place the chocolate chips in a microwaveable bowl and microwave on high power for one minute.

Once the coconut candies of hardened, dip them into the melted chocolate, then allow the excess to drip off. Place the chocolate-covered candies on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper. If you like, you can sprinkle some extra shredded coconut or flaked almonds on top, to decorate. Allow the chocolate to set before devouring! Making Jamaican Coconut Drops Gather your ingredients. To make this traditional Jamaican treat, you only need a few simple ingredients:\n2 brown coconuts\n1 cup of fresh ginger, diced\n2 cups of golden brown sugar, packed\n3 cups of water Prepare the fresh coconut. Take your fresh brown coconuts and use a screwdriver to poke holes through the eyes of the nut. Drain the coconut water from the center of the coconuts -- use or discard as you wish! Use a hammer to crack the coconuts open and use a butter knife to pry the coconut meat from the shell. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the brown outer layer from the meat, then use a knife to dice the coconut. Tip: You can make it easier to remove the coconut meat from the shell by baking the drained coconut in a 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Allow the coconut to become cool to the touch before cracking with the hammer. Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan. Combine the diced coconut, diced ginger, brown sugar and water in a heavy bottomed-saucepan and place over a medium heat. Bring to the boil. Stir the mixture continuously with a large spoon until it boils and the sugar starts to caramelize. Keep stirring as the mixture thickens to prevent the sugar from sticking to bottom and sides of the saucepan. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature -- you want it to reach approximately 295 \u00b0F (146 \u00b0C). Spoon the mixture onto a baking sheet. Once the sugar has caramelized nicely and the mixture becomes very difficult to stir, turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Working quickly, spoon drops of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with waxed paper, using about two tablespoons of mixture per coconut drop. Allow the drops to cool and harden before eating.
