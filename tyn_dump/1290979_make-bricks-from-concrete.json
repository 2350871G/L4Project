Use 9 x 4 x 3.5 inches (22.9 x 10.2 x 8.9 cm) for your brick dimensions. Rip the sheet of 3/4 inch plywood down to 12-inch (30.5 cm) wide x 48-inch (1.2 m) long strips. This will give you 8 bricks per strip, and the entire sheet of plywood will give you a total of 64 bricks. Cut the side forms down to 2 x 4 inches (5.1 x 10.2 cm).

Lay the strips of plywood on a flat level area and spread plastic sheeting over it to keep the concrete from bonding with the plastic. The work area will need to be left undisturbed for at least 24 hours. Place the assembled side form on top of the .75-inch (19 cm) plastic covered plywood strip. Either nail the side forms to the plywood or drive wooden stakes around the sides of the forms to keep the forms from shifting off of the plywood bottom strips.
