                    "description": "This method is best for dry, coarse, or tight curls. These types of hair are not well-suited to dry detangling. Dry hair will be prone to breakage, and tightly curled or coiled hair needs extra moisture to properly detangle. Water breaks down the bonds in your hair, making it weaker, more fragile, and more malleable. Condition your hair after you take out braids. If you have had your hair in braids for a while, do not comb through your hair when it\u2019s dry. Use the wet conditioner method to detangle your hair. This will ensure that you do not yank out hair. Brushing dry, curly hair can make it frizzy and even more knotted."

You will use your fingers, a wide-mouthed comb, or a paddle brush to work through the tangles and smooth out your hair. Even if you plan to wet detangle your hair, try to dry detangle as much of your hair as you can to make the job easier. In general, hair is easier to detangle when it is dry. Dry hair is stronger, so it won't break when you pull it. If your hair is too stubborn, then you may need to coat your brush in lubricating oil or olive oil to ease the detangling process."

        "Shampoo your hair a few times a week, at most.",
        "Make sure that your hair is dry when you get into bed.",
        "Try to shower in the morning.",
