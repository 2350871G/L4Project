Rinse them in water three or four times to make sure that they are completely clean. If you are making a sprouted green gram salad, you should use about 1 cup of green gram per person. So if you are making a salad to serve two, sprout 2 cups of the beans. You will be able to buy the beans from local grocery and health food stores."

The water should completely cover the beans, with the beans about an inch below the surface of the water. Do not use tap water for this. Soak the beans in water that has been boiled and then cooled to ensure it contains no contaminants. Leave the beans to soak for at least seven or eight hours. You might want to leave them overnight.

If the beans haven't sprouted after a day, rinse them and drain them before returning them to the container. Most mung beans will sprout within 24 hours. If it takes longer than two days for the beans to sprout, then don't eat them raw. Cook before using."
