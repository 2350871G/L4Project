        "The amount you use will depend upon the size of the metal part you want to anodize.",
        "You should have enough to completely submerge your anode.",
        "Be very careful not to spill as you mix.",
        "Put on a mask or respirator before you start working with acid.",
        "Turn on a fan to ventilate the area.",
        "Always pour the water in before the acid.",
        "If you spill any acid, cover it quickly with baking soda.",
        "Connect your aluminum wires to your power supply.",
        "The wire that leads from your anode should connect to the positive terminal on your power supply.",
        "The wire that leads from the lead cathodes should connect to the negative terminal of your power supply.",
        "Before you turn on your power supply, check the area around your plastic tub to make sure there aren\u2019t any spills.",
        "You should also double-check to ensure the power is safely connected and your skin is completely covered.",
        "Anodizing and Dying Metal Turn on your power source.",
        "Once your power source is on, slowly turn it up to reach your ideal amperage.",
        "A good rule of thumb is to use 12 amps per square foot of material.",
        "(12 amps per every 0.09 square meters of material).",
        "Increasing the power too fast or using too much can burn your aluminum wires.",
        "Keep the power supply constant for 45 minutes.",
        "You will see little oxidation bubbles start to form on the surface of the anode.",
        "The anode will also start to change color, turning brown, then yellow.",
        "If you don\u2019t see bubbles forming within about 30 seconds of starting your power supply, turn your power supply off and check your connections.",
        "This is usually an indicator that your power supply wasn\u2019t properly connected.",
        "Mix your dye during the anodizing process.",
        "If you plan on dying your part, prepare the dye so that it is hot and ready when your anode comes out of the bath.",
        "Different dyes will have different requirements, so prepare your dye as directed on the product packaging.",
        "Heating the dye will help increase the amount of pigment your part picks up.",
        "However, the dye should not be heated to a temperature over 122 \u00b0F (50 \u00b0C).",
        "Dye can be damaging to pots, so use an old one that you no longer use for food.",
        "Turn off the power supply after 45 minutes.",
        "Once your anode is done in the bath, turn off your power supply before attempting to retrieve it.",
        "Remove your aluminum carefully and rinse it with distilled water.",
        "Work quickly if you plan on dying your part.",
        "Be sure to wear protective gloves when retrieving and rinsing your part.",
        "Place the aluminum part in the warm dye bath.",
        "Let the part sit in the dye for 15 minutes.",
        "If you are only dying part of your anode (such as the bow of a key), wrap your aluminum wire around the part you don\u2019t want to dye.",
        "Use this as a handle to dip your anode into the dye.",
        "If you do not plan on dying your aluminum part, skip straight to boiling the part in distilled water for 30 minutes.",
        "Boil distilled water on a hot plate.",
        "You should have enough water to fully submerge your anode.",
        "Once your anode is done in the dye bath, remove it and place it in the boiling water for 30 minutes.",
        "Remove the hot metal carefully and allow it to dry.",
        "Set your newly dyed aluminum on a clean towel or rag and allow it to cool completely before handling.",
        "Once cooled, the surface should be sealed."
