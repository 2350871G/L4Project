Foil Pack Tilapia with Vegetables Preheat your oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C). Move the racks inside your oven so one of them is in the center position, or else your fish won\u2019t cook as thoroughly. Turn your oven on to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) and let it heat up completely before cooking. Combine melted butter, garlic, lemon juice, and oregano in a bowl. Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of melted butter and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice into a mixing bowl and stir it with a whisk. Chop 2 cloves of garlic with a chef\u2019s knife into small pieces and add them to the butter mixture. Then put in 1 teaspoon (1 g) of either oregano or thyme and combine the mixture thoroughly. You can use a mixture of oregano and thyme if you want to use both herbs. Put the tilapia filets on separate pieces of aluminum foil with asparagus. Rip off a large piece of aluminum foil for each filet you\u2019re cooking. Set the filet in the center of the aluminum foil along with 3-4 sprigs of asparagus next to it. Bend the sides of the aluminum foil up to form walls. You can also include slices of zucchini or broccoli in the aluminum foil if you want more vegetables. Make sure your tilapia is completely thawed if it was frozen. Pour the butter mixture over your filets and vegetables. Carefully split the butter mixture between each of the filets and spread it with a kitchen brush. Make sure the tilapia and asparagus are completely coated in the butter mixture so the flavor can absorb into the meat. Don\u2019t bend the sides of the foil down or else the butter mixture will spill and won\u2019t infuse with the fish. Wrap the foil around the fish so there\u2019s a small opening on top.

Place the wrapped filets on the middle rack of your oven for 15-20 minutes. Place the foil directly on the center oven rack or on a cooking pan so it can cook. Leave the fish alone inside of the oven for at least 15 minutes before checking if it\u2019s done. Check if the meat is white and flaky, and use a meat thermometer to see if it has an internal temperature of 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of your filets. Serve the fish with fresh lemon while it\u2019s still hot. Once the fish is finished cooking, put the foil wrap directly on a serving plate so you can open it just before you eat. Squeeze a fresh lemon wedge on top of the filet to add a fresh citrus flavor to your meal. You can keep tilapia leftovers for 4 days in the fridge or up to 3 months in the freezer. Broiled Tilapia with Lemon Mayonnaise Preheat your oven to broil. The broil setting on your oven will make your fish taste like it\u2019s been made on the grill. Turn your oven to broil and let it heat up completely before cooking. Make sure one of the cooking racks is in the middle position inside your oven. Not every oven will have a broil setting. Combine mayonnaise, parsley, and lemon zest in a bowl. Pour \u20444 cup (59 ml) of mayonnaise and 2 tablespoons (7.5 g) of fresh parsley into a mixing bowl, and stir them together. Use a zester or fork to scrape the zest off of a fresh lemon until you have 1 teaspoon (2 g). Use a whisk to thoroughly combine the herbs with the mayonnaise. You can also add 2 cloves of minced garlic to infuse your fish with more aromatic flavors. Put your tilapia on a lined baking tray with salt and pepper. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil so the fish doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom. Spread your filets evenly across the pan so they have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between them. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper on top of each filet. If you don\u2019t line your baking tray, spread a non-stick cooking spray on the bottom to prevent the fish from sticking. Spread the mayonnaise mixture over the filets. Use a spoon or a rubber spatula to scoop equal amounts of the mayonnaise mixture onto each of your filets. Spread the mayonnaise so it completely covers the tops of the filets. You can use as much or as little mayonnaise mixture as you want. Broil the fish for about 8 minutes until it flakes easily. Set the baking tray on the center rack of your oven and let it cook uncovered. After 8 minutes, check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer to make sure it\u2019s over 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Take the fish out of the oven once it reaches temperature and when the meat is white and flaky.Tip: Avoid opening your oven as much as you can while the fish is cooking or else some of the heat will escape. Serve the tilapia with fresh lemon wedges. Transfer the fish while it\u2019s still hot onto a warm serving plate so it\u2019s ready to eat. Provide a wedge of fresh lemon with each filet so you can squeeze some of the juice on top of the fish if you want. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days or in the freezer for 3 months. Whole Baked Tilapia Preheat your oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Move one of the oven racks into the center position so your fish can cook thoroughly. Turn the oven onto 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and let it preheat completely or else the fish won\u2019t have an even cook. Rinse your tilapia and pat it dry. Hold your fish under clean running water to rinse out any residual blood or waste inside of it. Rub the meat while you\u2019re cleaning it to clean it completely. Once you\u2019re finished rinsing it, use paper towels to pat the fish dry again. You can buy whole fresh tilapia from the seafood section of your local supermarket. You may also be able to get whole tilapia frozen. Brush the fish\u2019s skin with olive oil. Dip the bristles of a kitchen brush into 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil and lightly coat the outside of the fish. Make sure to brush the entire fish with the oil so flavors can infuse easier and so it doesn\u2019t stick to the baking pan. You can use any type of vegetable oil for your fish if you don\u2019t have olive oil. Hold the fish over your baking pan while you brush on the oil so you don\u2019t spill it. Place the fish in a baking tray with sliced lemons and red onions. Lay the fish flat on its side on the baking pan. If you\u2019re making multiple fish, then leave about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) between them so you have space to add aromatics. Fill in the space around the fish with sliced lemons and red onion so they can cook down and infuse flavors into the meat. You don\u2019t need to use lemon and onion if you don\u2019t want to, but it can add a lot of flavor to the dish. Stuff the inside of the fish with onions, lemon, cilantro, and garlic. Lift open the bottom of your tilapia so you can stuff aromatics inside it. Put 5-6 onion slices, 2 slices of fresh lemon, 1 \u00bd tablespoon (1.5 g) of fresh cilantro, and a clove of fresh garlic inside each fish. Close the fish so you don\u2019t lose any flavor..\nYou can stuff the fish with whatever herbs and spices you want. Try oregano, thyme, or dill for additional flavors. Bake the fish uncovered for 15-20 minutes. Put the baking pan in your oven on the center rack, and leave it alone for at least 15 minutes. Check the internal temperature of the fish with a meat thermometer to make sure it\u2019s at or above 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C), or else it\u2019s not safe to eat. Remove the fish from the oven once it\u2019s done cooking and the meat flakes apart easily. The cooking time for each fish will vary depending on its size and thickness. Serve the tilapia whole while it\u2019s still hot. Transfer one of the tilapia along with some of the cooked onions onto a serving plate with a fresh wedge of lemon. You can eat the skin and the meat of the tilapia. Keep leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days and in the freezer for up to 3 months.Warning: Watch out for pin bones in the fish. They can be sharp and will hurt you if you chew on or swallow them.",
