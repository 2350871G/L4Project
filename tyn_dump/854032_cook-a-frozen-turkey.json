    "text": " Thawing the Turkey in the Oven Take your turkey out of the freezer and unwrap it. Use scissors to cut the netting and plastic off the turkey. Leave the bag of giblets inside the turkey for now. Put the turkey on a roasting rack inside of a roasting pan. The turkey should be breast-side up on the rack in the pan. It's important that you use a roasting rack so the heat in the oven can circulate around the entire turkey. Preheat the oven to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). If there are multiple racks in the oven, remove all of them except for the one that's in the bottom third of the oven. That way there will be enough room for the turkey. Place the frozen turkey in the oven and let it thaw for 2 and a half hours. Avoid opening the oven during this time so heat doesn\u2019t escape. After 2 and a half hours, the turkey should be mostly thawed and have a golden brown color. Don\u2019t worry about seasoning your turkey yet \u2014 seasoning won\u2019t stick to a frozen turkey. You can season the turkey later after it thaws for a couple of hours in the oven. Use a meat thermometer to check the turkey\u2019s temperature after it\u2019s thawed. Stick the thermometer in the breast or thighs and give it a few seconds to read the temperature. At this point, the turkey should be around 100\u2013125 \u00b0F (38\u201352 \u00b0C).

Basting and Seasoning the Turkey Take the bag of giblets out of the neck of the turkey. The giblets are the organs of the turkey that are bagged and stuffed in the turkey\u2019s neck by the butcher. Now that the turkey is partially thawed, you should be able to pull the giblets out so you can discard them (or make gravy with them). Brush \u20442 cup (120 mL) of melted butter onto the turkey with a basting brush. Coating the turkey with butter will make it more flavorful. If you don't have butter, you can use olive oil instead. Season the turkey with salt and pepper. Start with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of salt and pepper and gradually add more if it's not enough to cover the whole turkey. Sprinkle the seasonings onto the top of the turkey and then gently rub them in with your fingers. You can also use other kinds of seasonings, like rosemary, thyme, and sage. Roasting the Turkey Roast the turkey for 1.5-5 more hours depending on its weight. The more your turkey weighs, the longer you\u2019ll need to roast it for. You can find out how much your turkey weighs by checking the plastic wrapping that it came in. 8\u201312 pounds (3.6\u20135.4 kg): roast for 1.5-2 more hours. 12\u201314 pounds (5.4\u20136.4 kg): roast for 2-3 more hours. 14\u201320 pounds (6.4\u20139.1 kg): roast for 3-4 more hours. 20\u201324 pounds (9.1\u201310.9 kg): roast for 4-5 more hours. Check on the turkey every hour. When you check on the turkey, check its temperature with the thermometer to make sure it\u2019s going up. You can also brush on more melted butter or oil to give it more flavor. If the turkey looks like it\u2019s burning or getting too crisp, cover the top with aluminum foil. Take the turkey out of the oven once it reaches 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). Your turkey will be fully cooked and safe to eat at this temperature. Check the temperature with the thermometer at multiple depths in different places to make sure the whole turkey is cooked through. Check the center of the turkey with the thermometer since it will take the longest to cook. Let the turkey cool for 30 minutes before serving. After 30 minutes, your turkey should be cool enough to carve and serve. Carve the turkey and serve it with stuffing, mashed potatoes, or your other favorite sides.",
