                    "description": "While it's the easiest method, caulking is usually a surface-level, temporary fix. Caulking is best for cracks in joints between a foundation and concrete surfaces, such as a driveway or sidewalk. It's also suitable for shallow hairline cracks in basement floors and non-load bearing walls. Find urethane concrete caulk online or at hardware and home improvement stores. Go with urethane caulk if you're confident the crack doesn't run deeply through your foundation wall or slab. Caulk can't penetrate the interior of a deep crack; a concrete injection kit is the way to go if the crack is more than 2 or 3 in (5.1 or 7.6 cm) deep.Warning: Cracks that are \u20444 in (0.64 cm) or wider, horizontal cracks, and basement walls that bulge inward are signs of structural problems. Consult a structural engineer for these issues. Look online or ask a local contractor for a referral."
