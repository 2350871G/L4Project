Insert the key and turn the power on. You should not crank the engine. There is a knob on your dash panel that toggles your trip and total odometer readings. Press this knob until you see \u201cODO\u201d on the instrument panel. You should turn the key off, and then back on. Hold the same knob for 10-15 seconds.
