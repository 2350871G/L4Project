You will be able to change the size of the cardboard box slightly during the project by making indentations and adding paper mache. Alternatively, you can use polystyrene foam instead of a cardboard box. Simply cut the polystyrene foam to size using a craft knife and use masking tape to hold any pieces together if you need."
