Drivers come in many shapes and sizes, but all share the same function -- they make noise. Many speakers have multiple drivers to handle many frequencies. For example, \"woofers\" are large drivers that work well for low-frequency sounds like bass, while \"tweeters\" handle high frequencies. Crossovers: These small relays take complex electrical signals and break them up into smaller parts to send to different drivers, isolating bass, treble, and mid-range frequencies. Cabinet: This is the shell of a speaker where the electronics are housed.

Wood glue is the preferred adhesive, but you can also use a drill and screws or biscuit clips as well.
