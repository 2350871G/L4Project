The goal is to build a frame that will fit a queen-size mattress (60\" wide x 80\" long). Beyond that, you'll need to visit your local home improvement warehouse to acquire three basic things:\nBed rail hangers\nWood\nWood screws Mount the bed rail hangers. This hardware is essential in forming a rigid connection between all the bed rails in the frame. Secure the bed rail hangers to the end of the side-rail and head post. Double check that each placement is consistent. Repeat the process for all corners. These hangers can sometimes be hard to find in hardware stores. If so, check online retailers.

This provides maximum weight support. Create the support blocks. Cut a groove into the support block and support beam, as shown. This groove should be a centered 1.5\"x 3.5\" slot, with the wider measurement following the wider part of the block. Attach the support blocks. Attach each support block to the center of the head rail and foot rail with screws as shown in the image. Connect the rails. Connect each rail to the post using the bedrail hangers. Add the support beams. Insert the support beam between the two support blocks. Insert your plywood mattress surface. Rest the plywood on the support rails and support beam. It should fit into the inner part of the bed frame. Once this is done, the mattress can be placed in the frame. Finished. Enjoy your new bed! Platform Bed Gather your materials and supplies. You'll need a circular saw, a number of basic L brackets, 3\" decking screws, some MDF or plywood, and then several cuts of lumber. For lumber, you'll need:\nTwo pieces of 85\" 2x4\nFive pieces of 67\" 2x4\nEight pieces of 19 3/8 2x4\nTwo pieces of 75\" 2x12\nFour pieces of 57\" 2x12 Create the base frame. Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 75\" 2x12s and two of the 57\" 2x12s into a  60\"x75\" box. Add the base bracers. Slide in the remaining 57\" 2x12s, space the box into thirds, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place. Set aside the completed base. Create the platform frame. Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 85\" 2x4s and two of the 67\" 2x4s into a 70\"x85\" box. Add the platform bracers. Slide in the remaining 67\" 2x4s, space the box into 4 sections, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place. Add the platform supports. You will now add the 19 3/8\" 2x4s between the bracers, two to a section. Space them evenly but stagger them, so that the leftmost and second right most sections have the supports at the same level and the rightmost and second leftmost have the supports at the same level. Attach these with decking screws as well. Reinforce the corners and joints. Reinforce the inside corners of both the base and platform with L brackets. You can also add L brackets around some of the other interior joints as well for added strength. Add the plywood surface. Trace and cut plywood to fit the surface of the platform. This will likely take two pieces of plywood to cover. Attach the plywood with decking screws to the inside bracers, such that the screws won't show on the exposed platform. Paint the bed. Sand the wood and then paint or stain the bed to the desired color. Done! Arrange the platform on top of the base in the final location.

Secure the center brace with an L bracket on each side at both the top and bottom. Add in shelves if desired. If you want to have shelves, you can add these in easily with some 1x10 lumber cut to 16 & 3/4\". Adjust the shelf to the desired height and then secure the bottom with L brackets, two to a side. Add a backing to the end shelves. Trace the shelves onto plywood and cut out the backing with a jigsaw. Nail it into place by hand or using a pneumatic nail gun. Add feet to the end shelves. You will probably want to add felt feet to the bottom of these shelves to keep them from scratching floors or moving around. These are easily bought from many different types of stores. Paint all four bookcases to match. With the shelves done, you will want to paint them and the Expedit shelves to be the same color. Use spray paint which is graded to go on laminate. Attach the plywood to the end shelves. Cut a piece of plywood to be 38\"x75\". With both shelves facing outward and the Expedit shelves dry fit between them, nail the plywood into place by driving two nails through the plywood and into the top of the sides of the end shelves. You can glue on a non-slip mat, like the ones which go under carpets, if you want to. Adjust the Expedit shelves as necessary. Adjust the Expedit shelves so that they are flush with the sides of the end shelves. Add finishing touches. Ikea makes several useful inserts for Expedit shelves.
