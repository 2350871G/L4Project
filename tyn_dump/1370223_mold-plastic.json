    "text": " Making a Mold from Reusable Materials Prepare the master part. The master part is the item that you will use to create the mold. To prepare the master part, first wipe down or wash the item. Once clean and dry, apply a release agent to the original item\u2014this will ensure that the master part will pop free from the mold. Coat the item with a layer of bubble buster\u2014this product prevents the formation of air bubbles around the master part. Place the master item into a heat safe container. The container must be slightly larger than the item. Melt your reusable molding materials in a microwave. Reusable molding material is easy to use and mistake proof; you can melt, mold, cast, and de-cast reusable molding material up to 35 times. Place the container of reusable molding material into a microwave. Follow the instructions on the product to properly melt the materials. Heat the material for short intervals, roughly 15 to 20 seconds, until you understand how the microwave affects the materials. If you do not have a microwave, you may use a double boiler. Pour the melted material over the master part. Carefully pour the melted molding material over the master part. Allow the product to cool and harden. Gently remove the mold from the heat safe container and the master part from the mold. Making a Silicone Mold Create a catalyzing solution with soap and water. When a high concentration of dish soap is combined with water, it forms a catalyst bath for silicone\u2014it allows the silicone to cure faster. In the large bowl, combine approximately 64 ounces of water with 4 ounces of blue dish soap. Mix the soap and water together with your hands. Catalyze the silicone. Use a pair of scissors to cut off the tip of the 100% silicone. Insert the bottle into a caulk gun. Empty enough of the 100% silicone into the catalyst bath to surround your master part. If you are unsure how much you will need, use the entire bottle of 100% silicone. Knead the 100% silicone in the catalyst bath. Submerge your hands into the catalyst bath and slowly gather the strings of 100% silicone into a ball. Massage the ball with your fingers. Pull, stretch, and fold the 100% silicone as you knead it. Continue to knead the 100% silicone until it stiffens and becomes less malleable. Form the mold. Retrieve your master part. Carefully flatten out the 100% silicone so that it is \u00bd inch thick.

Set your mold and master item onto the plate and allow it to cure for 1 hour. When the mold is no longer tacky to the touch, remove the master item. While the mold is curing, it is essential that the master item remain within the mold. Making a Two Part Mold Draw a centerline on your master part. The separate sides of a two-part mold join along the centerline of the master object. Retrieve your master item, a permanent marker, and a ruler. Draw a straight centerline around your master item. Embed half of the master item in a clay bed. Set a block of non-toxic and non-drying molding clay on your work surface. Embed the master item into the clay up to the centerline. The top of the item should line up with the top of the clay bed. There should be a 1 inch border of clay surrounding the remaining 3 sides of the item. Attach 4 alignment keys to the top of the clay bed. Alignment keys join the 2 halves together perfectly. Retrieve four \u00bd inch alignment keys and a bottle of temporary adhesive. Apply a thin layer of temporary adhesive to the flat side of the alignment key. Place the key in \u00bc inch from the top left corner and adhere it directly to the clay. Place 1 key in each of the remaining 3 corners. Secure the master part to a retaining wall. In order to fill the mold, you must provide an opening. For this mold, the opening will appear at the top of the clay bed. Apply a thin layer of temporary adhesive over the top of the master item\u2014the side not embedded in clay\u2014and the top side of the clay bed (the side directly below the top of the master item).
