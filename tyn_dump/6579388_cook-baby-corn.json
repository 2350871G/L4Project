    "text": " Cleaning and Trimming the Baby Corn Clean the corn. Rinse the baby corn under cool, running water, then dry it with clean paper towels. Fresh baby corn may have silks attached to the cobs, so you'll need to pull these silks away while rinsing them. If using frozen baby corn, thaw the corn before use and rinse away any remaining ice crystals. If using canned baby corn, drain the liquid and rinse the corn before use. Trim off the thick ends. Using a sharp kitchen knife, trim the thick stem ends off each cob of baby corn. The rest of the miniature cob can be left whole. Since baby corn is so small, it's often left whole when cooked and served. If desired, however, you can cut the corn into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes, cut the corn into 1-inch (2.5-cm) diagonals, or slice each mini cob in half lengthwise. Note that cut baby corn requires less cooking time than whole baby corn, however. Blanching Boil the water. Fill two-thirds of a small to medium saucepan with water. Bring that water to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, fill a medium to large bowl with ice water. Set this bowl aside for later use. Cook the baby corn for 15 seconds. Dunk the baby corn in the boiling water. After approximately 15 seconds, drain the water and remove the baby corn from the hot pan. Transfer the baby corn to ice water. Submerge the baby corn in the bowl of ice water. Keep the miniature cobs in the ice water for 30 to 60 seconds. The ice water halts the cooking process and prevents the corn from getting any softer. When you feel the baby corn, it should still seem quite crisp. Serve or use as desired. Drain the water and dry the baby corn. You can then serve the baby corn as it is or use it in other recipes.

Doing so can draw more flavor out of the corn as it cooks. Do not add the salt before the water boils, however, since doing so will increase the amount of time required to bring the water up to temperature. Cook the baby corn for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the baby corn to the boiling water. Cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to medium, then cook the corn until it becomes tender-crisp. You should be able to easily pierce the corn with a fork, but it should still have some \u201cbite\u201d or crispness. Do not cook it past the tender-crisp stage. Serve. Drain the water and serve the cooked baby corn while it's still hot. Consider serving the corn with melted butter. You can even season the butter with fresh herbs. You can reserve any leftovers by keeping them in a sealed container in your refrigerator, but you should try to use these leftovers within one or two days. Steaming Simmer the water. Fill a medium stockpot with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a steady simmer. Make sure that the steamer basket fits inside the mouth of the stockpot. The basket should be able to rest over the lip of the pan without touching the bottom of the pot. Place the baby corn in the steamer. Place the baby corn in the steamer basket, then set the steamer basket on top of the stockpot and over the simmering water. Try to arrange the baby corn cobs into an even layer to promote even cooking. Cook for 3 to 6 minutes. Cover the steamer and stockpot with an appropriate lid. Steam the baby corn until it becomes slightly tender. Check for doneness by piercing the corn with a fork. It should be easy to pierce, but it should still retain some crispness. Past the \u201ctender crisp\u201d stage, baby corn can become soggy and unpleasant. Serve. Remove the baby corn from the heat and serve it while it's still hot. Consider serving the baby corn with butter or a drizzle of olive oil. Store leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator. Use within one or two days. Stir Frying Heat the oil. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cooking oil to a medium skillet or wok. Set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat. Olive oil works well, but you can use other cooking oils, as well. Consider using vegetable oil, canola oil, or sunflower oil. Cook the baby corn for for 2 to 4 minutes. Add the baby corn to the hot oil. Cook, stirring continuously, until the corn becomes tender and light golden brown on all sides. When bitten or pierced with a fork, the baby corn should feel tender but should still retain some \u201cbite\u201d or crispness. Serve. Drain the oil and serve the baby corn while it's still hot. The cooking oil should added flavor to the corn, so you probably won't need to add any butter. You could, however, serve the corn with a sprinkle of fresh herbs or a dash of pepper. Save leftovers in an airtight container and store them in your refrigerator for up to one or two days. Deep Frying Preheat the oil. Pour 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) of vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat, and heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Use a frying thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. If the oil isn't hot enough, the batter could get soggy before the corn finishes cooking. If the oil is too hot, the batter could burn before the corn is adequately cooked. Mix the batter. Meanwhile, combine the all-purpose flour, corn starch, chili powder, garlic powder, and salt. Add enough water to this mixture to form a thin, paste-like batter. This is a very basic batter, but you can vary the spices as desired to produce a stronger or milder flavor. Drench the baby corn in batter. Working in batches, dip the cobs of baby corn into the batter. Use a fork to turn each baby corn, coating all sides. Fry the baby corn for 2 to 4 minutes. Toss several coated cobs of baby corn into the hot oil. Fry the corn until both sides are golden brown, flipping them once halfway through the process. Continue working in batches to avoid crowding the pan. The temperature of the oil will drop slightly when you add the corn to it, and adding too much at once can drop the temperature too severely, thereby inhibiting the cooking process. Drain and serve.

Deep fried baby corn is difficult to save and will likely become soggy if you attempt to reheat it after refrigeration. If necessary, however, you could refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to one day. Braising Combine the broth and seasonings over heat. Pour the chicken/vegetable broth into a medium frying pan. Stir in the soy sauce, salt, and pepper, then bring the seasoned broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook the baby corn for 3 to 6 minutes. Place the baby corn in the seasoned broth. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan, then cook the corn until it becomes tender-crisp. Consider turning the corn once halfway through the cooking process. Doing so can help distribute the flavors of the broth more evenly. Do not cook the corn beyond the tender-crisp stage.

Remove the baby corn from any remaining broth and serve it while it's still warm. Store leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to one or two days. Roasting Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil. Toss the baby corn in oil. Arrange the baby corn on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle the cobs with sesame oil. Toss gently, using a fork, to coat the corn evenly. If desired, you could also sprinkle the coated baby corn cobs with a little salt for an additional boost of flavor. Roast the corn for 20 to 25 minutes. Place the baby corn in the preheated oven and cook it until they become tender and light golden brown. To promote even browning, stir and flip the baby corn cobs halfway through the baking process. Ideally, the baby corn should be tender-crisp when you remove it from the oven. If you roast it too long, it can become unpleasantly soggy. Serve. Remove the finished corn from the oven and serve it while it's still warm. Save leftovers in your refrigerator, keeping them inside an airtight container. Use within one or two days. Microwaving Place the baby corn in a microwave-safe dish. Arrange the baby corn in a single layer inside a shallow, microwave-safe dish. Pour the water over the corn. Loosely cover the dish with its lid or with a sheet of microwave-safe plastic wrap. Microwave for 2 to 7 minutes. Cook the baby corn on high power until it becomes tender-crisp. The exact cooking time will vary depending on the type and size of the baby corn. Canned baby corn has already been pre-cooked, so it should be done within 2 minutes. Smaller portions of frozen or fresh baby corn may require 3 or 4 minutes, while larger portions might need the full 7 minutes. Check the corn at 1 to 2 minute intervals to avoid cooking it past the tender-crisp stage. Serve. Drain the cooking water and serve the baby corn while it's still hot. You can serve the baby corn with melted butter, if desired. Store leftovers in an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to one or two days.",
