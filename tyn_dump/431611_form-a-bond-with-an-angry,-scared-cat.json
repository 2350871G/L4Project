Start by having the person fill the cat\u2019s food dish and then simply sit on the other side of the room without making eye contact or otherwise paying any attention to the cat. Have the person move slightly closer over the course of several repetitions. Have the person give her treats as well. Set the treat out where your cat can see it and then move away to a similar distance, moving closer over time. Your cat will begin to associate this person with good things instead of treating the person as a fear trigger. Remember to let your cat set her own pace. Luring her out is not the same as forcing her. Ultimately, she needs to choose to come toward the person."
