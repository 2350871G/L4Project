Some soaps make bubbles that last longer than others, so experiment with different types until you find one you like. Simply mix one part liquid soap and 4 parts water in a jar, cup or bowl. Try these different types of soaps:\nLiquid dish soap. This makes a great bubble base, and it's something you probably already have on hand. Body wash or shampoo. These may not be quite as sudsy as liquid dish soap, but they should still work fine for making bubbles. All natural laundry detergent. Stay away from commercially-produced detergent, which may not be safe for kids to use. Chemical-free laundry detergent can be found at health food stores."

Bend the top section of a pipe cleaner into a circle shape, then bend the tip of the circle around the shaft of the pipe cleaner to create a wand.

You'll need a large wand shape with a piece of mesh or screen to cover it; this helps stabilize the solution so the bubble can form without popping. Straighten out a wire coat hanger. You may need a pair of pliers to untwist the top of the wire. Bend one end of the wire into a large circle shape, then fasten the tip of the circle to the straight part of the wire by bending it with pliers. Wrap mesh or wire netting, like chicken wire, around the circle. Use the pliers to bend it in place."
