This step is critical to getting the best results possible from your steam cleaning efforts. Move all furniture in the room off of the carpet or rug so you can thoroughly vacuum every bit of the area to be cleaned. Use your vacuum's hose and tool attachments to clean the baseboard areas and corners of the room, which can be hard to reach using a standard upright vacuum. Replace your vacuum's filter(s) and empty the canister (for bagless) or change out the bag (for bag style) before vacuuming. This will ensure that your vacuum's suction power is as high as possible for best pre-cleaning results. Go over the same areas twice of more to pick up anything that was missed on the first pass. Do not attempt to steam clean a carpet without vacuuming first. If you don't have a vacuum, rent one or borrow one from a friend."

Rub a bit of the solution into a test patch into a small area of your carpet (no more than 8 square inches). Let the solution sit on the carpet for about 10 or 15 minutes and then check on it. If the carpet appears to be at all discolored, dilute the solution a bit more then run a second test. Ideally, you should use a spare scrap of your carpet or a spot that is normally out of sight (such as the corner of a closet) to do the test. If your solution discolors or burns the test patch, you don't want it to be somewhere obvious. If your carpet reacts severely to the cleaning solution, consider using a milder cleaner. Some carpets might not do well against certain types of cleaners, and you don't want to risk destroying yours."

Fill the tank on the steam cleaning machine with hot water to the maximum fill line. Mix in the appropriate amount of cleaner for the volume of water you are using, as stated on the cleaner bottle (for example, one fl. oz. per half gallon of water). Some steamer machines may not have a water tank and instead will include a hose you can attach to your kitchen or bath tap. If you are using this kind of steamer, make sure you turn on the hot water on the faucet. Be sure to add the cleaner and water to the correct tank on the machine. It can be easy to mistake the dirty water reservoir for the clean water tank if you aren't paying attention. Follow all safety guidelines on the cleaner bottle and wash your hands immediately if you get any on your skin. You can also create a homemade cleaning solution that may be gentler on your carpet and safer for pets and small children than the typical chemical mixtures you can buy in most home supply stores. Some people use laundry detergent or dish soap (highly diluted), or more natural ingredients such as citrus-based organic cleaners."

To suck up the solution, release the trigger and slowly roll the machine backwards over the area you just covered. Start in a far corner of the room so you can work your way back toward the doorway. This way, you won't have to step on carpet you've already cleaned. Go over areas with stubborn dirt or stains more than once for optimal steam cleaning results.

If it is not raining or too cold outside, open a window in the room to increase air flow. This should help the carpet dry faster. If you have a small heater with a fan in it, you might be able to speed the drying process by placing it on a chair or table and pointing it into the room you have just cleaned.

Wipe off the surface with a damp rag or cloth once you've sufficiently scrubbed it. This can be a very time-consuming and tedious task. In many cases, steam cleaning will be enough to get the grout clean, so only do this if you have extremely dirty or unsanitary tile grout. You do not need to get the surface totally spotless before steaming, as this process will clean away any residue left from your grout pre-treatment. Some tile floor steamers have attachments specifically for cleaning grout. These often include hand-held attachments with stiff bristles on the end of a narrow wand that you can use to scrub the grout as the machine emits steam. This is a good way to pre-treat grout before steaming the rest of the floor. Steam your floor. Once the machine is heated up, slowly push it along the floor like you would a push broom. Steam is given off at the base of the machine and moistens the floor (but does not soak it) as you push it forward. Pull the mop back across the steamed area to allow the cleaning pad to mop up any excess residue. Start on one side of the room and work your way across to the other, moving backward as you go so you don't step on the freshly-cleaned surface. Let the floor dry by itself before you walk on it or put furniture or rugs back into place. It is not necessary to towel-dry it. Open doors and windows (weather permitting) to speed drying. You can also place a fan near the clean floor to improve airflow through the room.",

        "Use a vacuum with an upholstery attachment to do this.",

        "Some might include stiff bristles around the mouth of the nozzle, which could be too rough for delicate upholstery.",
        "Whereas some carpet steamers can even be rented from grocery stores, upholstery-specific steam cleaners are somewhat more rare.",

        "Keep cushions and covers off the furniture until everything is completely dry.",
        "It may take an entire day or more for cushions or padded surfaces to dry completely, as they tend to soak up water.",

        "Select a hard-floor steamer.",
        "Steam cleaners made specifically for hard surfaces will provide the best results, so choose one made for this purpose when buying or renting a machine.",
        "Most are the upright style, resembling a standard vacuum.",
        "Hard floor steam cleaners are usually lighter weight and less bulky than those made for carpets and do not spray water directly onto the floor.",
        "Not all hard floor steam cleaners are safe to use on wood floors.",
        "If you intend to steam clean a wood floor, make sure your steamer is approved for this.",
        "Hard floor steam cleaning is usually done using only hot water (no cleaning solution).",

        "Pre-treat tile grout.",
        "If you are cleaning a tile floor with stained or dirty grouting, you may want to pre-clean the grout before steaming it.",
