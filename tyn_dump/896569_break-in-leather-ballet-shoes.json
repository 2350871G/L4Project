Spray the front, left and right sides. Spray the back as well. Ensure that the entire outer area of the shoes is damp. Aim the hair dryer at the shoes. Start with the front, pulling on the toe front as you dry it. Repeat on the sides and the back, pulling the shape outward as you dry.  Repeat as necessary. The shoes should stretch enough in a short space of time. Advanced stretching to fit a smaller pair Get a size smaller than usual for this method. When shopping for new ballet slippers, don't be tempted to buy the ones that fit with room to spare, get a size down and stretch them to fit your foot exactly. Buy a pair of leather ballet shoes in a size lower than your normal size. Take off any elastic straps on the ballet shoes.  Try to fit the shoe on your foot. It should be very very tight, even painfully so. Using rescue oil or bio-oil, rub the full leather exterior of the shoe. Cover every part. Get a wooden spoon, and push it into the toe part of the shoe. Push it until it stretches as far as it will go. Do the same for the heel of the shoe.
