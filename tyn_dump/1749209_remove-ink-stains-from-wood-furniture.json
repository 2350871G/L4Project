Follow up with a clean, damp cloth to rinse it off, then dry the area with a clean towel. If the stain is still visible, you can use superfine steel wool (number 0000) dipped in liquid wax. Rub the steel wool lightly onto the stained area. The steel wool should remove only a fine layer of the surface. It's important to be gentle so that you don't remove too much wood.
