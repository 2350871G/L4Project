Ask the people running the talent show if you can have a copy of the scorecard or judging criteria to help you practice. If points are earned for originality, put some unique flair on the song you choose or change up the tempo. For example, sing an upbeat rock song like, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d by Journey as an acoustic rendition and slow down the verses and chorus. If one of the criteria is stage presence, try a song that helps you move around the stage and engage the crowd, like \u201cGirls Just Want to Have Fun\u201d by Cyndi Lauper or \u201cThe Devil Went Down to Georgia\u201d by the Charlie Daniels Band."
