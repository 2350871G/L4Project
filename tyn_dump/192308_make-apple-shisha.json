                    "description": "The first thing you need to do to make your own apple shisha is to prepare the tobacco by breaking it up into strips. The tobacco serves as the base ingredient that holds everything together. As well as the main ingredient for smoking. American Spirit loose tobacco works well, but you should feel free to try any type of loose leaf tobacco to get the flavor you want. Cheaper loose leaf pouches like Drum also work. Pipe tobacco can also be used for a more smokey flavor, but will be harsher than regular tobacco. Make sure your tobacco has dried out before preparing it. If it is moist, expose it to open air to let it dry out for a few hours or overnight. Once dry, break up any large pieces of tobacco in a Tupperware dish. Take out any spines that may be present on larger leaves. Then, you may want to chop the leaves with a knife if you have whole leaf tobacco."

                    "description": "Once the leaves are chopped and broken up into smaller bits, you need to soak the tobacco. Soaking the tobacco makes it pliable and removes some of the nicotine and takes out some of the harsher tobacco flavors. The longer you soak the tobacco the less flavor you will taste. Less tobacco flavor allows you to taste more of the apple. Pour cool water into your Tupperware. Use enough water so that you can mash the tobacco down under the water level. Mash the tobacco down so it really soaks. Soak the tobacco for at least 30 minutes. If you soak longer than 30 minutes, change the water. The water will turn brown from the tobacco and nicotine. Alternatively, you can boil your tobacco, then rinse it several times with cool water."

Honey and molasses are fairly similar but will yield slightly different results. Honey won\u2019t flavor the shisha quite as strongly as molasses will. Whichever you choose, you want to use a honey or molasses that aren't very expensive. If using molasses, make sure it is not sulfured. If using honey, less expensive honey is better because most of the flavor will get lost in the process. It\u2019s easiest to use honey or molasses that are more raw which you can spoon out onto your tobacco. Spoon the honey or molasses over your tobacco. The ratio should be roughly 3 to 1.
