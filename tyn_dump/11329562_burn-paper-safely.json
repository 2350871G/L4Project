Stone fire pits are typically built into a patch of dry ground, while metal or brick fire pits are elevated structures that keep the fire 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) off of the ground. Fire pits will contain the blazing papers and allow you to have a hot fire without endangering the surrounding trees or grasses. If you don\u2019t have a fire pit, you can purchase a metal or brick one from a nearby home-improvement store. Elevated fire pits have an additional advantage: since they\u2019re elevated up off of the ground, it\u2019s easier for air to circulate beneath the fire. This allows for better ventilation and allows the paper to burn well."

        "It\u2019s also wise to burn papers on a humid day so that, even if a few embers do blow away, they\u2019re unlikely to start a fire.",
        "It\u2019s always a good idea to check the local fire danger before burning papers outdoors.",
        "Set a fire extinguisher within 5 feet (1.5 m) of the fire location.",
        "Even if you\u2019re only planning to burn a handful of papers, you need to have a fire extinguisher within reach.",
        "Fires can quickly grow out of control, so it\u2019s important to have an extinguisher nearby to put the fire out.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a fire extinguisher, purchase one at a local hardware store or home-improvement store.",
        "Clear the area of other flammable materials.",
        "Regardless of where you\u2019re planning to burn the paper, it\u2019s important that you keep the fire from spreading.",
        "To that end, move any flammable objects at least 10 feet (3.0 m) away from the fire.",
        "This include wooden pallets, garbage cans, piles of firewood, cans of oil or gasoline, and anything else that could catch fire.",
        "If you\u2019re concerned about the fire spreading, try pouring a perimeter of sand around the area where you\u2019ll burn the paper.",
        "Start a small wood fire before you begin burning the paper.",
        "Paper burns out quickly, so you\u2019ll need a few logs to be burning before you add the paper to the fire.",
        "Lay down a base of tinder such as pine needles or shredded newspaper.",
        "Layer small twigs over the tinder.",
        "Finally, place 3-4 medium-sized logs.",
        "Lean the logs against one another so they don\u2019t lay flat on the kindling and prevent it from catching fire.",
        "Then, start the tinder burning with a lighter or matches.",
        "If starting the fire is difficult, you can also squirt a small amount of lighter fluid onto the base of the fire.",
        "Feed the sheets of paper into the fire 1 or 2 at a time.",
        "If you drop a whole stack of papers into the fire at once, it will likely extinguish the flames.",
        "Avoid this by putting papers into the blaze gradually.",
        "After the first few papers have caught fire, add additional sheets gradually.",
        "Wait until the pieces of paper have caught fire and are burning steadily before adding any new sheets to the blaze.",
        "If the fire is on the verge of going out, try placing 3\u20134 small pieces of kindling into the fire to keep it going.",
        "Stay nearby and keep an eye on the fire as the papers burn.",
        "Once you\u2019ve lit the papers, don\u2019t just walk away and leave the fire.",
        "A gust of wind could blow embers into the grass, an animal could run into the fire, or a child could come by and try to grab flaming papers.",
        "Stay within 5 feet (1.5 m) of the fire as long as it\u2019s burning to prevent any accidents.",
        "If you need to go indoors (e.g., to use the restroom) ask another adult to watch the fire.",
        "Dispose of the ashes once the fire has burned itself out.",
        "Unless you burned the papers over a bathtub, you\u2019ll be left with a pile of ashes once the fire is out.",
        "Use a stick to poke around in the fire pit and make sure there aren\u2019t any glowing embers left.",
        "Then, don\u2019t just leave the ashes in your fire pit or burn barrel.",
        "Instead, sweep them up using a dustpan and broom.",
        "Pour the burned ashes into a trash can or a compost bin.",
        "Unless it\u2019s an emergency, avoid dousing the fire with a bucket of water.",
        "This will turn to ashes into a goo which will be impossible to dispose of.",
        "Burning Papers Indoors Fill an indoor bathtub halfway full with cold water.",
        "If you live in an urban area and don\u2019t have access to a fire pit or other outdoor burning facility, you may be forced to burn papers inside.",
        "The best place to do so is over a bathtub.",
        "Plug the tub so it won\u2019t drain, and fill it halfway full with water.",
        "Before burning the paper, make sure that any flammable materials are at least 3\u20134 feet (0.91\u20131.22 m) away from the tub.",
        "This includes towels, bathmats, and bottles of shampoo or conditioner.",
        "Burn 4\u20135 sheets of paper over the bathtub at a time.",
        "You can use either a butane lighter or wooden matches for this.",
        "Ignite the papers 4\u20135 sheets at a time by lighting the edge or corner with a lit match.",
        "As the papers burn, hold them over the water.",
        "That way, if the flames get out of control, they\u2019ll drop into the water and be extinguished.",
        "Burning papers in a tub works best if you only have a small stack to burn.",
        "Otherwise, the smoke could set off the fire alarm.",
        "Be careful not to burn your fingers as you hold the burning papers over the tub!",
        "Dispose of any floating bits of paper that didn\u2019t burn up.",
        "It\u2019s unlikely that all of the paper will turn to ash.",
        "You\u2019ll probably be left with a few small pieces of charred paper floating on top of the water in the tub.",
        "Scoop these up with your hands and drop them into a trash can rather than letting them get pulled down the tub\u2019s drain.",
        "Make sure that none of the bits of paper are still hot when you throw them away."
