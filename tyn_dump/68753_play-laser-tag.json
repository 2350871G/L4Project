They can be rented out or you can simply show up and get in line with your friends, although you should check ahead of time to see if the arena has open play before you go. Pick an area that looks cool to you and visit with 6-30 friends. The cost for playing laser tag is usually between $10-50 per person. You can certainly purchase your own laser tag equipment, but people usually play at areas since they\u2019re designed with unique layouts that make playing fun. You also usually play laser tag in the dark, and an arena allows you to play under dim lighting which makes the game more fun."

        "If you aren\u2019t, move by staying low and shuffling quickly to stay out of firing range.",
        "Other common game modes include battle royale, where every player is on their own and the last player standing wins, and capture the flag, where a team wins by capturing a position or item.",
        "Playing a Match Start playing once the buzzer goes off.",
        "Enter the arena and set up with your team.",
        "Either start in the assigned area, or find a safe end of the arena.",
        "Wait until the buzzer goes off to start the game.",
        "Some arenas use other cues to indicate when the game has started, like dimming lights or an announcement of some sort.",
        "If you\u2019re allowed to pick where to start, it helps to begin in an area far away from your opponents so that you can track their movements from a safe distance.",
        "If you\u2019re starting from a predetermined area, identify a safe set of cover nearby where your team can set up.",
        "When the buzzer goes off, sprint or move quickly to that location.",
        "Shoot at your opponents to knock them out or stun them.",
        "When you pull the trigger while aiming at your opponent\u2019s vest, you\u2019ll hit them.",
        "Depending on the style of game that you\u2019re playing, this will either knock them out of the game, or \u201cstun\u201d them.",
        "When a player is stunned, their gun stops working and you\u2019re awarded points.",
        "Players that are stunned will be knocked out of play for 5-30 seconds depending on the arena\u2019s rules.",
        "In some arenas, you can still hit your opponent when they\u2019re stunned but they can\u2019t shoot back.",
        "Rack up as many points as you can while their gun isn\u2019t working by firing repeatedly.",
        "Avoid taking fire by ducking for cover and moving quickly.",
        "To avoid getting knocked out or stunned yourself, look for obstacles on the map that you can duck behind.",
        "Move from cover to cover when travelling across the map to avoid getting hit, and never stay out in the open for too long.Tip: Sometimes, you can cover the sensors on your vest by raising your gun up.",
        "In some arenas, there\u2019s a sensor on the gun too though, so this won\u2019t always be a successful strategy.",
        "Zig-zag while you run to make it harder to aim at you.",
        "This is only a good strategy in open areas though.",
        "Play until the end of the round or until you\u2019re knocked out.",
        "When time in the round is up or a team has won, your vests will either go off, or a buzzer will signal the end of the game.",
        "In some arenas, the lights will turn back up.",
        "When the round is over, either reset for the next round, or leave the play area to view the scoreboard.",
        "There are usually multiple rounds played in a single session.",
        "A session can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours.",
        "Playing as a Team Work in pairs to make you harder to pick off.",
        "It will be easier to take down individual opponents if you\u2019re rushing them with a partner.",
        "Similarly, it will be harder to sneak up on you if you\u2019ve got a teammate watching your back.",
        "Before the game starts, split your team up into smaller pairs.",
        "When occupying a position, have one player cover one direction and another player cover the opposite side to stay safe while playing.",
        "You can split up into teams of 3-4 if you prefer.",
        "It will be harder to move around without making a lot of noise or getting noticed at that point though.",
        "Cover for your teammates by laying down covering fire.",
        "When a teammate is moving across the map, they\u2019re going to be an open target for the enemy team.",
        "Help keep them safe by firing repeatedly at the enemy\u2014even if you think you\u2019re going to miss.",
        "This will make the opponent less likely to take risks, and they\u2019re going to be less accurate while they\u2019re aiming at your friend.",
        "Ask your teammates to lay down covering fire for you when you\u2019re moving!",
        "Blitz a position as a team to take occupied ground.",
        "If the enemy is held up in a safe location on the map, it may be hard to just sneak your way in there and take them down.",
        "Instead, carry out a coordinated attack by spreading your team out and attacking quickly from multiple sides.",
        "Be willing to give up a few players to shake the enemy loose from their spot and take the position for yourself.",
        "Be careful when using this strategy.",
        "If it goes poorly, you\u2019ll end up giving up a lot of points.",
        "Keep a nearby exit open in case you get rushed.",
        "When your team is holding a position down, identify a nearby escape route that you can take in case you get rushed.",
        "Try to avoid taking up positions that are corners or tight areas where you won\u2019t be able to escape if you get sieged or rushed.",
        "In general, positions with multiple exits are better spots to hold down anyway, since your team will be able to cover multiple paths and take down the individual players that walk by.",
        "Shooting Strategically Shoot while you\u2019re moving to keep the enemy off of you.",
        "When you\u2019re moving, if your team isn\u2019t providing covering fire, provide it yourself.",
        "Before you start moving, raise your gun up and look down the sights.",
        "Then, as you\u2019re moving, keep your head on a swivel by looking back and forth down the sights.",
        "If you see any opponents, fire repeatedly to keep them from hopping up and getting a free shot.",
        "In general, unless you absolutely know there\u2019s no one around, you shouldn\u2019t lower your gun.",
        "Take the high ground if there\u2019s a second floor.",
        "If the arena has multiple levels, taking the high ground can make it easier to track your enemy.",
        "From the second floor, you\u2019ll have an easier time spotting the enemy as they move across the map.",
        "You\u2019ll also be safer from the second floor since your opponent would have to look upwards to notice you.",
        "The one instance where this may not be true could be the beginning of the game.",
        "If there\u2019s a second level, a bunch of players are likely going to be rushing upstairs as soon as the buzzer goes off.",
        "Expect a massive shootout in the first minute or two.",
        "Change your rate of fire based on your ammunition.",
        "If the guns have limited ammunition, you\u2019ll need to conserve your ammunition and maneuver around the map to get into position for higher-percentage shots.",
        "If the guns have unlimited ammunition, you\u2019ll be rewarded for firing as often as possible and playing a little more defensively by finding a safe spot and shooting from cover."
