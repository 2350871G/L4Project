If you are concerned about getting an exact number for the spacing between your horizontal stripes, try using this simple formula - ceiling height/2x. For example, take the height of your ceiling divided by 2x to get the number of inches between each line. The 'x' in this equation would be the number of chevron stripes you'd like on your wall. So, if your ceiling is 90 inches and you want to paint three stripes, then the formula would follow 90/2(3), and you would get 15 inches (38.1 cm) between each stripe."

For example, do you want them to be vertical or horizontal? You can also decide on their thickness, number, and shape. The thinner your stripes, the more of them you will be able to put on the wall. Draw a grid on a blank sheet of paper. To get the cleanest and most accurate lines, draw a graph to plot out your design before your start.

Each line should be halfway from the middle line to the outer edge of the paper. You should now have three equidistant vertical lines going down the sheet of paper. Do the same thing with horizontal lines. Using the ruler, draw a horizontal line in the middle of the sheet of paper. Then draw two additional horizontal lines above and below it to create 16 equal-sized squares on your sheet of paper. You will use these as points of reference for your stripes. Begin creating an outline for the stripes. Starting on the square at the upper left-hand corner of the page, draw a diagonal line from the upper left-hand corner of the square to the lower right-hand corner of the square.
