If your wood is pretty rough to start with, begin sanding with a rough sandpaper with a grit of 100 or 120. Progress from rougher grit to finer grit sandpapers, which allows you to reduce major irregularities before achieving a fine finish. To get a very smooth surface you should end with 400 grit sandpaper. Even if your wood already feels pretty smooth, take the time to run 400-grit sandpaper over it before sealing it. This will ensure that the surface is completely smooth once the sealant is applied. Sand with the grain, which means that you need to follow the lines of the wood grain straight back and forth. This will help you avoid leaving behind swirly marks on the surface.Warning: Wear a dust mask while you are sanding to avoid inhaling wood particles."

A tac cloth is a special sticky cloth that is specially made to remove the dust from the surface of wood after sanding. Tac cloth will remove even fine particles that resist removal from a cloth.

        "Work quickly across each face of the wood, one band at a time.",
        "Shellac can be a challenging sealant to apply because you need to keep each band wet as you work on the next one.",
        "Don't touch the shellac while it's drying.",
        "In contrast to polyurethane, you should not interfere with the shellac's drying process or manipulate it in any way.",
        "Do not use steel wool and do not sand the shellac in between band applications.",
        "The shellac melts into itself with each subsequent coat, creating a smooth finish on its own.Tip: You can actually apply polyurethane or lacquer over shellac if you don't like the shellac and want to try a different finish.",
        "Putting Lacquer on Wood Pick lacquer only if you have experience applying sealants.",
        "Lacquer is a very durable finish that is applied with a spray gun.",
        "It is a very high performance finish, drying quickly to a hard, with a durable finish.",
        "It is not easy to apply as an amateur, and is not forgiving of mistakes made during application.",
        "A spray gun can be purchased for $50-$100, and is necessary if you plan to use lacquer.",
        "Take safety precautions while you apply lacquer.",
        "Maintain a ventilated area and don't spray lacquer near any sparks.",
        "Make sure to take the proper safety precautions when spraying lacquer.",
        "Lacquer is highly toxic when inhaled, so make sure to maintain a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator.Warning: If you are using a fan for ventilation, make sure it doesn't spark.",
        "Apply your lacquer in thin coats.",
        "Lacquer should only be applied in very thin coats with your spray gun.",
        "Pull the trigger as you get close to the piece, move the gun over the surface, overlapping the previous spray path by about 50%, and release the trigger just after moving beyond the edge.",
        "Move the spray gun back and forth over the surface quickly until the entire surface is coated.",
        "Keep the gun moving so that you never allow a buildup of lacquer in one specific spot on the wood.",
        "This will help you avoid drips and the \"orange peel\" effect.",
        "Apply 3-4 coats of lacquer total.",
        "Wait for the lacquer to dry completely before applying additional coats.",
        "Once the surface is dry, which can take around 30 minutes, apply the next coat in the same fashion, making sure that the gun keeps moving and coats the surface evenly.",
        "Once you have several coats applied, the surface will be sealed and smooth to the touch."
