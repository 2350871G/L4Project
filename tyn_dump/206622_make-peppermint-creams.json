Take it out of the bowl when it reaches thick enough texture, and knead it on the on top of a table sprinkled in icing sugar.  Dust the surface with icing sugar.  Roll out the mixture till it is about half a centimetre thick.  Cut out small shapes (circles are easiest), and put them on a tray which has also been dusted with icing sugar. Do them quite thin.
