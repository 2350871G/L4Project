Use the edge of the blade to peel off the top layer, or the skin, off of the onion. Submerging the Onions in an Ice Bath Place the whole onions in a pot of boiling water. The water should already be boiling before putting in the onions. Let them cook for 1-2 minutes. While the water is coming to a boil, you can prepare an ice bath. Fill a medium mixing bowl with water and ice cubes. You can add salt to the boiling water to add flavor, but skip this if you are going to use the onions in a recipe that calls for adding salt. Drain the onions in a colander. Remove the onions from the heat source so that they do not continue to cook. Overcooking the onions at this step can complicate using them in another recipe, so move quickly. Plunge the onions into an ice bath. Drop the onions from the colander directly into the ice bath. This will immediately stop the cooking process and loosen the onion skin. Cut the roots off of each onion and squeeze them out of their skins. Once the onions are cold enough to handle, the skin should easily slide off. Try using a pinching motion to roll the skin off of each onion. Cutting and Blanching Cut the roots and the stem off of the pearl onions. While you are cutting, bring a pot of water to a boil on the stove. Hold the onion steady with one hand, making sure to curl your fingers away from the blade of the knife. Trim as little as possible to only remove the roots and stem.

Transfer the onions into an ice bath. Drain the onions from the hot water first, using a colander. Then place them directly into the cold water. This will immediately stop the cooking process and loosen the onion skin. Use a paring knife to peel away the top layer of skin off of each onion. The skin should easily peel away with the help of a sharp blade. Wait until the onions are cold enough to handle to avoid being burned.",
