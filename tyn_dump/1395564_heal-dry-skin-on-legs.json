Those natural oils not only keep your skin moist, they also protect your skin from damage which can cause even more dryness. If you shower too often, you might be removing more of these natural oils than your skin can replace, leading to dry legs. Try showering once a day or every other day. If you have to shower in between, use cooler water and only soap the most affected areas (like your armpits and groin area). Showering for too long or too often can also cause problems. Bathe for no more than 10 to 15 minutes at a time, no more than once per day."

Exfoliate your skin occasionally. Exfoliating is good for your skin but you need to do it in a gentle way and not exfoliate too often. A baking soda paste or washcloth should be more than enough to remove dead skin cells, while items like loofahs and pumice stones can actually make the problem worse. Use a fresh razor and shave gently, if you shave your legs. Dull razors can irritate your skin and make the problem worse or even cause it to begin with.
