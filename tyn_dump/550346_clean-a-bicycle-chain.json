If possible, use a bike stand that securely holds your bike, lean your bike against a wall, or set your bike upside down on the ground so it rests on the seat and handlebars. Having your bike oriented wheels upward is a definite bonus. This will make the chain and drivetrain of your bike more accessible, raising it up to a level more comfortable for you to work and inspect. A bike stand is a simple holder for your bicycle that you can buy or build from scrap parts. It usually consists of hooks attached to a frame.

Regular cyclists will likely want to perform a chain cleaning once every week, or at least once every 200 miles (321 km). A quick eye inspection should be enough to tell if your chain needs cleaning. However, if you are unsure, feel the chain with your fingers. If it feels as though the chain is caked or that its movement is limited by grime, it's time to clean. Preventative maintenance can prolong the life of your chain and keep your sprockets in good condition. By cleaning your chain regularly, you'll also be aware of changes that happen in your chain over time, like chain stretch or damaged links. While checking the state of your chain, you'll have an excellent opportunity to find the master link for the chain. The master link, like a Connex or SRAM Powerlink link, allows you to easily remove your chain from the drivetrain. Most have a pin/slot configuration where you can slide a small pin out of a slot to open the link and remove the chain. If does not have a master link, you can install one of these yourself or have it done a local bicycle shop. This is usually fairly inexpensive, generally costing around $15 or less."
