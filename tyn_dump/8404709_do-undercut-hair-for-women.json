An undercut removes some of the weight and body from your hair so it\u2019s an ideal option for thick, coarse hair that can sometimes get too puffy. If you have fine or thin hair, you may want to reconsider choosing an undercut. It can actually make your hair appear thinner and take away the body. An undercut can be a good style for big, curly hair because it can take out some of the bulk."

                    "description": "An undercut can be as subtle or as deep as you like, depending on how short you cut the hair. Take the length of the rest of your hair into account. The shorter that your hair is overall, the shorter you can go with the undercut without creating too big a contrast. With long hair, you may want to keep the undercut a little longer for a more subtle look. If you want to ease your way into an undercut, keep it at 13- to 16-mm. For a bolder undercut, go for 6- to 10-mm. When you\u2019re trying an undercut for the first time, it\u2019s best to go for a longer cut. You can always go shorter, but you\u2019ll have to wait for your hair to grow out if you cut it too short to begin with."

If you\u2019re getting your first undercut, it\u2019s best to keep the area that you cut fairly small. However, if you want a bold look, you may want to use a larger area for the undercut so more of it peeks out. In general, most undercuts involve the nape area of the head. The line of your natural part serves as the border. This type of undercut is usually only visible if you pull your hair up unless your overall haircut is very short. For the most dramatic undercut, you can cut the two bottom sections or even leave just the top section out and cut all of the lower layers. Keep in mind that if you do drastic undercuts like these, your shorn hair will be visible most of the time."
