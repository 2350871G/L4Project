Then draw a line across the rectangle. Fold the paper so that the ends touch the line.  Repeat this process five more times. Use a different color of construction paper for each repetition. Apply glue to the outside flaps of each rectangle.  Begin constructing the first cube by connecting the flaps of one rectangle to the inside surface of the other rectangle, making two phases of the cube.  Glue a third rectangle onto the newly added one. Make sure the flaps of rectangle one attach to the inside surface of rectangle three. Repeat this step and attach the rectangle to the other side of the second rectangle. Attach the base new rectangle to the top flaps of the third and fourth rectangles.  Slide the final rectangle in place by attaching its flaps to the third and fourth rectangles, closing up the cube.  Repeat these steps eight more times to make eight cubes in total.  Putting the Cubes Together Arrange the cubes into two groups of four by putting four cubes of one color on top and four cubes of another on the bottom.  Using clear tape, attach top and bottom rows of cubes together in pairs. Do this by placing a small piece of tape on one side of the cubes, then fold the side with tape and place another piece of tape on the opposite side. Repeat on the left side of the cubes. Continue by combining the bottom four cubes (with the same color) by adding clear tape to the right side.
