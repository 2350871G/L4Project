Depending on your model, you may need to flip a switch near your furnace or turn it off at the breaker. You should also turn off the gas using the shut-off valve connected to the gas line. Locate the bleed screw on the fuel pump near where the fuel line comes in. The screw is usually a small nipple-like screw. Place a small bucket or pan under the bleed screw.
