So, if you\u2019re using PPR pipe that's 50 millimetres (2.0 in) in diameter, choose the socket pair marked for 50 mm. Handheld fusion tools can usually handle PPR pipes ranging from 16 to 63 millimetres (0.63 to 2.48 in), while bench-mounted models can handle pipes up to at least 110 millimetres (4.3 in). You can find various models of PPR fusion tools online, ranging in price from around $50 to over $500 USD."

Many fusion tool sets come with a trigger- or pincer-style pipe cutter. When used according to the directions, these will create smooth, even cuts in PPR that are ideal for fusion welding. PPR pipe can also be cut with a variety of hand or power saws, or wheel-style pipe cutters.
