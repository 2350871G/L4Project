A door hinge is usually installed 5 inches (13 cm) from the top of the door and 10 inches (25 cm) from the bottom. To use a level, set the level at the top of the hinge. Rotate the hinge until the bubble in the level is between the 2 middle vertical lines. Use a combination square by lining up the edge of the square with the edge of the door, cabinet, etc. The combination square will create a right angle, helping you line up your hinge."
