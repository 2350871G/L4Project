Conversely, wider sections tend to be more calm, but blocking them off may require quite a bit more material and labor. If possible, try to find a site that offers a good compromise between size and ease of access. Be sure to also take into account how much time you have, as well as the amount of raw materials available to you. For instance, you may be able to dam up a 10\u201315 ft (3.0\u20134.6 m) section of the river in a just few hours using materials gathered on-site. Avoid areas where the river floor is especially soft, loose, or uneven. A weak base could leave your dam vulnerable to leakage. If the floor of the section you've chosen for your dam is too deep for you to see or feel, it's probably too deep to build on."

Use a shovel, drainage spade, or trenching hoe to remove the dirt or sand along the riverbank in long, straight pits roughly 1\u20132 ft (0.30\u20130.61 m) wide. If you do this correctly, your trenches will drain the water from the river's main channel, allowing you to begin constructing your dam. If you're digging multiple trenches, space them about 2\u20133 ft (0.61\u20130.91 m) apart to prevent the trapped water from draining back into the river. Angle each of your trenches away from the river in the same direction, parallel to one another. Make sure you dig your trench or trenches deep enough to carry the water away from the river without creating surface runoff. It's not necessary to empty the river completely. You just need to direct enough water out of the main channel to make it sufficiently shallow to work in.Tip: The larger the river, the more trenches you'll need to dig in order to effectively divert the flow of water."
