Make sure your pan or pot has a lid that goes with it. The best popping temperature is between 400 and 460 degrees Fahrenheit. Oil burns at 500 degrees. If your oil starts to smoke, it's too hot. You can also add salt to the oil to help season the popcorn from within, instead of adding it on top after the popcorn is fully popped."
