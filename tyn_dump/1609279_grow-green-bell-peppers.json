Some pepper plants don\u2019t even need a separate fertilizer if a little compost is added to the soil at intervals. Organic materials like mulch also help the soil retain moisture, which is useful for making sure green pepper plants get enough water in hot weather. Since calcium deficiency can cause the bottom end to rot on peppers, you can increase the amount of calcium in your soil by grinding eggshells and mixing it in with your soil (alternatively, use lime). If you use a fertilizer, make sure it has lower nitrogen content and it is not ammonia-based. Excess nitrogen and ammonium can be a cause of calcium deficiency."
