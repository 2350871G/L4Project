It is important to remember that some types of begonias are grown for their brilliantly colored flowers, while other begonias are enjoyed for their unique and beautiful foliage. Most begonias bought at nurseries will be labeled as indoor plants or outdoor plants. There are two main categories of cultivated begonias based on growth habits. Also there are hybrids within these groups. Cane Begonias grow upwards on tall stems that resemble bamboo in appearance. The Angel Wing Begonia is a common example. Fibrous root Begonia species have stems that are directly attached to the crown of the plant like that of radish leaves. This group includes the Rex Begonia hybrids.

                    "description": "When potting your begonias, you should keep three factors in mind: the type of soil, the size of pot, and the amount of soil you use. When choosing your potting material, you want the soil to be relatively neutral or slightly acidic on the pH scale. Your pot should roughly fit the size of your plant--you want to keep root growth in mind but do not want the pot to be overly large. A pot that is too large can lead to using too much soil. When a pot contains too much soil, it can lead to soggy soil that could potentially \u2018drown\u2019 your plant roots and kill your begonia. Some people also grow begonias in wet stones or small pebbles as a top medium. You don\u2019t have to completely bury the plant\u2019s rhizome to do this. Just place it on top of the stones."
