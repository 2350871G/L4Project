    "text": " Southern-style Fried Pork Chops Combine the salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and celery seeds in a bowl to form a rub for the pork chops. Arrange the pork chops on a large plate and rub the seasoning onto both sides of each piece. Pour the buttermilk over the pork chops, flipping them over once to coat both sides. Spread the flour out in a large, shallow plate and have it ready. Heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius) in a deep skillet. Dip each pork chop into the flour, making sure to thoroughly coat each piece. Brush off any excess flour and then transfer each piece of meat into the skillet. Arrange the meat in a single layer on the pan, cooking in separate shifts if necessary. Fry each piece of meat for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Flip each piece over once as you cook. Remove the chops from the skillet and place them in a serving dish that is lined with paper towels. The paper towels will absorb any excess oil. Serve immediately. Enjoy with a side of salad, grilled vegetables, and/or mashed potatoes. Pork and Ginger Stir-Fry Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and fry until fragrant. Add the pork, soy sauce, and sugar to the skillet. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix in the sesame oil, green onion, and rice wine. Lower the heat to a simmer and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, or until the pork is tender. Remove the skillet from heat. Serve with white rice and garnish with shredded carrots. Stir-Fried Pork Tenderloin with Broccoli Put the pork slices in a mixing bowl and toss with the rice wine and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Combine 1/4 cup of the chicken broth, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, the cornstarch, sesame oil, oyster sauce, and crushed red pepper in a small bowl. Mix the ingredients together and set aside. Heat a wok or skillet over high heat. Add the vegetable oil to the pan and once it is hot, add in the pork. Cook for about 1 minute, or until no longer pink. Transfer the pork to a separate plate.
