Spread the loop slowly apart. This will bunch the twists together. Spread the sides of the loop evenly, so the turns don't overlap each other. Once the twists have gathered about 10 inches (25 centimeters) below the free end of the line, you're ready for the next step. Hold the standing line tight while relaxing the free end. Let the free end first relax to a 90-degree angle with the twists, then let it roll over the twists. Keep pressure on the loop while holding one hand over the twists to keep them from unraveling. Tie a half-hitch around 1 strand in the loop. If you're right-handed, this will probably be the right-side strand; if you're left-handed, this will probably be the left-side strand. Draw this knot tight. Wrap the free end around both loop strands 4 times. Thread the free end of the line through this new loop to form a locking hitch. Spit on the knot.
