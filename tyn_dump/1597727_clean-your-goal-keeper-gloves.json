The best way for your gloves to dry is naturally but to get all the excess water out, you need to use a towel. Get one glove and place it in the middle of an old face towel. A bath towel will be far too big. If that's all you have, fold it in half or quarters until it's small enough to work with. Fold the towel in half with the glove in the middle. It should look like a burger, with the towel being the bun and the glove being the burger. Walk or jump on top of the gloves, which should be covered with the towel.
