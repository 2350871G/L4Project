(You can leave out the glass dish if you are using a real double boiler) Create one by heating a saucepan of water and placing your glass container in the water until wax and Vaseline have melted. After they have melted give it a stir and add your perfume/body spray of choice. Give it a little time to boil up and do it's thing! As the mixture bubbles, the alcohol is being boiled off so the end result will be a bit stronger than it was in the bottle, and it will last longer on skin. The longer you boil it, the stronger it will be. After 3-5 minutes of boiling (depending on how strong you'd like it) pour your mixture into a clean container. If you want to take it on the go, get a container with a lid or use an old lip balm tube for easy application on the go! After you've poured it, place in the fridge or freezer for a few hours to set.
