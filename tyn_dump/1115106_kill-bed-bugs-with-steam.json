Kevin Carrillo\t\t\tMMPC, Pest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Bedbugs and their eggs die off at around 121\u00b0F, and steam is emitted at 180\u00b0\u2014200\u00b0F, so the steam is definitely hot enough to kill the bugs. However, the steam needs to applied for at least a couple of seconds in order to be effective, so move the steamer slowly over any surface you're treating."
