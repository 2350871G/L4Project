If you are using a dry rub on the ribs, then think about what sauce will complement the seasonings used in the dry rub. Either purchase your favorite sauce from your local grocery store or consider making a homemade sauce if you have the time. For example, create a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce by placing 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil and 1/4 cup (37.5 g) of minced onion into a saucepan over a medium heat. Cook the onions until they are tender. Then, stir in 1/2 tsp (1.05 g) ground cumin, \u20442 cup (120 mL) of ketchup, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of hot chili sauce, 2 tbsp (25 g) of light brown sugar, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar, and salt and ground black pepper to taste. Allow this to cook for 2 minutes before removing it from the heat and setting it aside. Unless you are cooking the ribs in a slow cooker, refrain from applying the sauce until the ribs are fully cooked. Otherwise, the sauce will burn and ruin your ribs."

    "text": " Preparing the Ribs and Seasonings Trim unwanted fat from a rack of ribs and cut it into portions of 2-3 ribs each. Place a 2\u20132 \u20442 lb (0.91\u20131.13 kg) rack of ribs on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to trim away any unwanted fat or membranes. Then, carefully cut the rack of ribs into serving portions that are 2-3 ribs each. If you do not want to trim and portion the ribs yourself, ask your local butcher if they would mind prepping the rack of ribs for you. Remember to wash your hands before and after handling the raw meat to avoid cross-contamination. Rub salt and pepper to taste on both sides of your ribs for a simple seasoning. Either place the ribs in a large bowl or leave them on your cutting board. Sprinkle salt and freshly ground black pepper on each side of the ribs. Use your fingers as needed to rub the seasoning into the meat to get it to stick. Regardless of what cooking method you use, it is important to at least season the ribs with salt and pepper. Otherwise, your meat will taste bland after it is finished cooking. If you are planning to use a dry-rub to season your ribs, then incorporate the salt and pepper into the dry-rub instead. Apply your favorite dry rub to the ribs for a more complex seasoning. Use your fingers to sprinkle the dry rub onto both sides of the ribs. Then, rub the seasoning into the meat and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before cooking it. Instead of using a store-bought dry rub, create your own! For example, create a pepper barbecue rub by mixing together 1/4 cup (28.75 g) of paprika, 1 tbsp (5.4) of ground cumin, 1 tbsp (12.5 g) of brown sugar, packed, 1 tbsp (5.4 g) of chili powder, 1 tbsp (5.4) of ground black pepper, 1 1/2 tsp (3.15 g) cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp (0.5 g) of ground cloves in a bowl. Create a simple spicy rub by mixing together 1 tbsp (5.4) of salt, ground black pepper, paprika, and chili powder. Select your favorite barbecue sauce to use on your ribs after they are cooked. Pick sauces that are sweet, spicy, or tangy to complement the flavors of the pork. If you are using a dry rub on the ribs, then think about what sauce will complement the seasonings used in the dry rub. Either purchase your favorite sauce from your local grocery store or consider making a homemade sauce if you have the time. For example, create a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce by placing 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil and 1/4 cup (37.5 g) of minced onion into a saucepan over a medium heat. Cook the onions until they are tender. Then, stir in 1/2 tsp (1.05 g) ground cumin, \u20442 cup (120 mL) of ketchup, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of hot chili sauce, 2 tbsp (25 g) of light brown sugar, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar, and salt and ground black pepper to taste. Allow this to cook for 2 minutes before removing it from the heat and setting it aside. Unless you are cooking the ribs in a slow cooker, refrain from applying the sauce until the ribs are fully cooked. Otherwise, the sauce will burn and ruin your ribs. Making Oven-Roasted Ribs Preheat your oven to 225 \u00b0F (107 \u00b0C). Remove any baking sheets that you may have stored inside your oven. Then, place the oven rack on the middle rung before setting your oven to preheat. Put your ribs, meat-side down, into a large roasting pan and cover it with foil.

Apply as much or as little of the sauce as you want on your ribs. Save any leftover sauce to dip the meat into later. Cook the uncovered ribs for another 20-30 minutes to caramelize the sauce. Use potholders to carefully place the uncovered roasting pan back into the oven. Allow the ribs to continue cooking for 20-30 minutes or until the sauce begins to bubble and caramelize. Check on the ribs every 10 minutes to make sure that the sauce is not burning.
