So if there is someone at your school for example, that seems kinda lonely, try to get to know them. If you are too shy for this, have no fear! If they don't seem to wanna talk, you could just shrug and say that they can always come and talk to you if they want/need to."

However, she did not tolerate bullying and had no problem standing up for herself! When James bullied Severus, she showed no fear, but walked right up to them, and told James to stop. Although, she could be rather sensitive. She got really, really sad when Severus called her a \"mudblood\". Understandable, his was her best friend. She tried not to think about it too much though, and tried to stay positive even in harsh situations."

So skip all those products that you may use right now, and show the world that pretty face of yours as it was meant to be! Not saying that you should skip makeup entirely, just don't overdo it. Put on some natural coloured eyeshadow, some mascara and if you'd like, some light blush. It's definitely enough!"

If you don't want to, or are not allowed to completely dye your hair red, get highlights if you can, but only if you want to. As for the eyes, It can be uncomfortable to wear contacts, so skip them if you don't like the thought of wearing them."
