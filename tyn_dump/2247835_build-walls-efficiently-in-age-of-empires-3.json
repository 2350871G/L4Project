Use the nature it will be much easier for you to send your defending troops to the action when there is not much wall. However, your opponent can knock the forest down with a well aimed cannonball, making this strategy ineffective against experienced real players. Don't make the wall far away from your village. If the enemy gets through the wall, it will be difficult to defeat him because he can spread his troops and can cause huge trouble to your villagers etc. So really think about which part of your village needs to be defended and build the wall around this area."
