When frying the chips, pour 1/2 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a heavy skillet with high sides and heat it on medium high over the stove.

        "If you plan on frying or baking the chips, though, you should preheat the cooking elements before preparing the chips.",
        "If frying your chips, pour 1/4 inch (1.25 cm) of cooking oil into a dry skillet with a heavy bottom and deep sides.",
        "Heat the oil on medium high until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).",
        "Do not allow the oil to begin smoking, however.",
        "If baking the chips, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).",
        "Dry the tortilla shells.",
        "Corn tortilla chips made from tortilla shells are easier to fry if they are completely dry.",
        "If you plan on baking or microwaving the chips, though, you do not need to worry about drying the tortillas out first.",
        "Open the package of tortillas and spread them out in a single layer on a clean kitchen counter.",
        "Let them dry for several hours to overnight.",
        "Alternatively, dry them in the microwave.",
        "Lay the tortillas out in a single layer on a paper towel and microwave for 20 to 60 seconds.",
        "They should only be dry when finished, not crisp.",
        "Cut each tortilla into wedges.",
        "Use a pizza cutter or sharp kitchen knife to cut each tortilla into six equal wedges.",
        "Cut the tortilla in half, then divide each half into three even pieces, working out from the center point.",
        "These wedges should be fairly triangular in shape.",
        "You can experiment with other shapes and sizes, as well, including strips or smaller wedges.",
        "Keep in mind that the sizes of your chips should be fairly equal to ensure an even cook time for each batch.",
        "Cook the chips.",
        "As stated previously, these chips can be fried, baked, or microwaved.",
        "To fry the chips, place a handful of your wedges into the hot oil, keeping them to a single layer.",
        "Fry for 2 minutes or until the chips deepen in color and become hard.",
        "Remove the chips with a slotted spoon or tongs and line them up on a plate covered with layers of clean paper towel.",
        "Keep an eye on the temperature of the oil as you fry your chips.",
        "When you add your chips to the oil, the temperature will drop.",
        "When you remove the chips, the temperature will rise.",
        "Adjust the temperature controls of your oven accordingly to maintain an even temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).",
        "To bake the chips, spread the wedges out onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper.",
        "Keep them in a single layer.",
        "Bake for 6 minutes, then turn them over using tongs and bake for another 6 to 9 minutes.",
        "The chips are done once they become firm and start to deepen in color.",
        "To microwave the chips, line the microwave with paper towels and spread the chips out over the paper towels in a single layer.",
        "Microwave for 30 seconds to 2 minutes, or until the chips look crispy but not burnt.",
        "Season with salt and serve.",
        "Sprinkle the chips with salt, to taste, as soon as they finish cooking.",
        "Let them cool to room temperature and enjoy.",
        "Corn Tortilla Chips from Scratch[2]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Preheat the oven.",
        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).",
        "Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.",
        "If neither are on hand, you could coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray, instead.",
        "Combine the masa harina and salt.",
        "In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the masa harina and salt until well combined.",
        "Use clean hands or a mixing spoon.",
        "Note that masa harina is a traditional Mexican corn flour.",
        "If you cannot find masa harina, use another corn flour.",
        "Do not use corn starch or cornmeal.",
        "Add the water.",
        "Gradually add hot water to the masa harina mix, stirring continually to combine the ingredients.",
        "Stop adding water once a dough forms.",
        "The water only needs to be hot; it does not need to be boiling.",
        "You will likely end up using between 1/2 cup (125 ml) and 3/4 cup (185 ml) water.",
        "Stir the dough with a spatula to make sure that the ingredients are thoroughly blended together.",
        "The dough should not be able to crack or fall apart.",
        "After stirring the ingredients together, knead it a few times with your hands.",
        "Form the dough into a ball.",
        "Use your hands to pack the dough into a solid ball.",
        "Allow it to sit in a warm, dry area for 30 to 60 minutes.",
        "Divide the dough into smaller sections.",
        "After enough time has passed, divide the ball of dough into eight even sections.",
        "Roll each of these sections into balls.",
        "Flatten the dough out.",
        "Lay out a sheet of parchment paper.",
        "Place a small ball of dough on top of it, then cover it with another piece of parchment paper.",
        "Use the bottom of a plate or pan to flatten the ball into a circle that is less than 1/4 inch (6 mm) thin.",
        "Repeat this same procedure with the other seven balls of dough.",
        "If you do not have parchment paper, plastic wrap or plastic bags could also be used.",
        "If you need to apply more force to flatten out the dough, you could roll over the plate with a rolling pin or otherwise set something heavy on top of it.",
        "After the dough has been flattened sufficiently, carefully peel off the parchment paper or plastic.",
        "Cut each round into wedges.",
        "Divide each round into six even, triangular wedges.",
        "Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut them up.",
        "Arrange the wedges onto your prepared baking sheet in a single layer.",
        "For best results, spray or coat the unbaked corn tortilla chips with a little olive oil.",
        "You may also sprinkle them with additional salt, to taste.",
        "Bake.",
        "Place the corn chips in your preheated oven and bake them for about 10 minutes.",
        "When done, they should look golden in color and have a crispy texture.",
        "Serve.",
        "Allow the corn tortilla chips to cool until they are safe to touch.",
        "Share with friends or enjoy the chips on your own."
