In order to avoid this, use cool or cold tap water as you wash the spinach leaves, regardless of how you rinse them. For an added cleanse, you can use a mixture of 3 cups (710 mL) of water and 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar to wash spinach, though it will only remove slightly more bacteria than water alone. Stay away from produce washes and soap when washing spinach, which leave a slight residue that is difficult to rinse off and can be harmful to your health."
