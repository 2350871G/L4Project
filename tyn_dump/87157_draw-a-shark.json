Draw a pointed angle on the right side of the circle.  Sketch a \"fishtail\" on the bottom of the drawing using angled shapes.  Draw the shark\u2019s fins. These are characterized by being pointy and slightly curved. Draw the shark\u2019s nostrils and the eyes using an egg-like shape. Add a curved line for the eyebrows. Real sharks do not have big eyes like these but it's okay to use your imagination for cartoon versions. Draw the shark\u2019s mouth. Sharks are known to have really sharp teeth, you can draw its teeth using triangles. Sketch out the shark\u2019s body from the outline.  Darken the fins and tail.  Draw the shark\u2019s gill slits using three curved lines. For a cartoon shark, you can divide the body into the posterior and anterior parts using a line straight across the body. Erase unnecessary lines.  Color the drawing.  Method Two: Drawing a Simple Shark Draw a triangle with the pointed angle facing the right. Stretch out the triangle by elongating the shape using two not so straight lines across and end it with a vertical line. At the left side of the drawing, draw a curved triangle with the pointed angle facing downwards. Draw the shark\u2019s fins using triangles. The shark has pectoral fins, dorsal fins and anal fins. Add the tail using slender angles pointing towards opposite directions.  Using the outline and sketch the shark\u2019s head. Add the eyes, nostrils and mouth. Darken the lines for the fins and tail.  Darken the lines of the shark\u2019s body based on the outline.  Add five lines on the side of the shark for its gill slits. Divide the shark into anterior and posterior part usually because of its color. The posterior part is darker in shade. Divide the drawing using slanted strokes right across the shark\u2019s body. Erase unnecessary lines.  Color the drawing.  Method Three: A Bull Shark Draw an oblong for the midsection of the shark.  Draw a sharp curve on the left part of the oblong drawn previously for the head section.  Draw a longer curve on the opposite side to make the body.  Draw angled curves to make the fin outlines.  Draw a long angled sharp curve with another smaller curve the bottom for the tail fin.  Draw curves for the mouth and gills; Add a circle near the mouth and edge of the head for the eyes.  Based on the outline, draw the whole shark  Erase the unnecessary outlines.  Color your bull shark!  Method Four: A Sand Tiger Shark (Front View) Draw an arc with a sharp corner for the head.
