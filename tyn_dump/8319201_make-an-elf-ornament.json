    "text": " Making a Beaded Elf Cut a small semi circle out of felt. Trace a 1\u00bd-inch (3.91-centimeter) wide semicircle on a sheet of red or green felt. Cut the semicircle out with a pair of scissors. This will make the elf's hat. Red and green are the most popular elf colors. You can use other colors too, however. Glue or sew the straight edges of the semicircle together to make a cone. Fold the semicircle in half widthwise with the straight edges touching. Sew or glue the straight edges together, but leave the tip of the cone open. This will allow you to assemble the elf at the end. Hot glue will work the best for this. For a more rustic touch, use embroidery thread in a contrasting color. Paint your beads, if desired. Push the beads onto skewers or toothpicks, then stick the skewers/toothpicks into wads of clay. Paint the beads as desired, then let them dry. You will need 16 small beads for the arms and legs. You will also need a large bead for the body, and a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wooden bead for the head. Paint the 16 small beads red or green. Paint the body bead the same color as the small beads. Paint the head bead a flesh tone that suits you. Don't worry about the face yet. Bend a pipe cleaner in half. This will make the skeleton for your elf. The ends will be visible as feet, so choose the color wisely. A red, green, or black pipe cleaner would work best for this. Thread the body bead, the head bead, and the hat onto the pipe cleaner. Slip the body bead over the bent part of the pipe cleaner first. Push it down about halfway, then add the head bead. Finally, add the hat. Position the hat over the elf's head. For a final touch, consider threading a mini jingle bell onto the pipe cleaner. Position it right above the hat. Shape the bent part of the pipe cleaner into a loop. Adjust the body, head, and hat on the pipe cleaner so that the bent part is about \u00be-inch (1.91-centimeter) long. Use a pencil to pry open the bent part so that you get a small loop. You will be threading a ribbon through this later so that you can hang your elf up. Draw the face on the head bead. You can draw the face using a marker, or you can paint it on using a thin paintbrush and acrylic paint. Keep the face simple. A pair of black dots, a smile, and some rosy cheeks will be plenty. Thread 4 small beads onto each end of the pipe cleaner. Spread apart the loose ends of the pipe cleaner skeleton, just below the body bead, to make a V shape. Slide 4 small beads onto each end, pushing them up against the body bead. These will make the legs. Fold the ends of the pipe cleaner over to make the feet. You should have a little bit of pipe cleaner sticking out from each leg. Fold the ends over once or twice to make the feet. Bend the feet so that they are at 90-degree angles to the beads. This will keep the leg beads from falling off. Cut a pipe cleaner in half. Take a new pipe cleaner, and cut it in half. This will make the arms and hands. You can use another red or green pipe cleaner for this. You can also use a flesh-toned pipe cleaner instead if your elf doesn't wear mittens. Save the other half of the pipe cleaner for a different project. Wrap the pipe cleaner around the elf's neck. Place the mini pipe cleaner behind the elf, between the head and body beads. Make sure that it is centered, then twist both ends around the elf's neck to secure it. Spread the ends out like a T. Slip 4 small beads onto each arm. Push the beads onto the pipe cleaner until they bump up against the body of the elf. Fold the ends of the pipe cleaner to make the ends. You can fold the ends over several times to make hands. You can also roll the ends into tight spirals to make \"fists.\" Make a scarf for the elf, if desired. Cut a \u00bd by 4-inch (1.27 by 10.16-centimeter) strip out of red or green felt. Cut a small fringe into each end. Cut a small slit into the scarf, 1\u00be inches (4.5 centimeters) from one of the ends. Wrap the scarf around the elf's neck. Pass the opposite end through the slit, and tighten it. Add a ribbon loop so that you can hang your elf. Cut some thin ribbon, and thread it through the loop at the top of your elf. Tie both ends into a tight knot. You can use any color you want, but red, green, or white would look best. The thinner the ribbon, the better. About 1/16 and 1/8-inch (0.8 and 3.2-millimeters) wide would be ideal. Making a Block Elf Get a 1\u00bd-inch (3.81-centimeter) alphabet block. If you can't find one, you can make your own. Paint a 1\u00bd-inch (3.81-centimeter) wooden block white with acrylic paint. Add a thin border on each face using acrylic paint. Next, paint a letter on each side. If you need to, use a stencil to make the letters. Red, yellow, blue, and green are classic alphabet block colors. Make the legs. Cut a 1\u00bd by 3-inch (3.81 by 7.62-centimeter) strip out of red or green felt. Cut a 1\u00bd-inch (3.81-centimeter) long slit into it to separate the legs. Round the ends of the legs to make the feet. The strip needs to be the same width as your alphabet block. If your block is narrower/wider, cut the strip accordingly. Glue the block to the feet. Coat the bottom of the block with hot glue. Quickly press it down onto the feet, just above the slit. For a final touch, consider gluing little pompoms or jingle bells to the ends of the feet. Make the arms. Cut a \u00bd by 4\u00bd-inch (1.27 by 11.43-centimeter) strip out of red or green felt. Round the narrow ends to make the hands. If you'd like to, you can cut little notches into the side of each hand to make gloves or mittens. Glue the arms to the center of the block. Turn the block so that the feet are facing you. Draw a horizontal line of hot glue across the top of the block. Quickly press the arms down into the glue. Make sure that the arms are of equal length on both sides. Cut a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) circle out of white felt. This will make the collar. If you want something fancier, cut a short piece of 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide white lace, and run a straight stitch along the edge. Gather the lace until it coils into a circle, then tie the ends of the thread to hold the collar together. Glue the collar on top of the arms. Make a large top of glue on top of the arms, right in the middle of the block. Press the center of the white collar into the glue. Don't glue the entire collar down; this will allow it to stick up a little. Cut a triangle out of felt. The triangle needs to be wide enough needs wide enough to wrap around the a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wooden bead, plus extra for the seam. Glue the ends of the triangle together to make a cone. Fold the triangle in half lengthwise so that the slanted edges are touching. Secure the edges with hot glue. For a final touch, consider gluing a mini pompom or a jingle bell to the tip. Glue the hat onto a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wooden bead. Draw a ring of hot glue inside the rim of the hat. Quickly push the hat on top of the head. You can stick the hat straight down onto the head, or angle it back slightly for a more fashionable touch. Make sure that the bead's hole is inside the hat. Draw or paint a face on the bead, just below the hat. Add two small dots for the eyes, and a curve line for a small. Add some rosy cheeks, and a pink or red dot for the nose. You can make the face using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush, or you can draw it on using permanent markers. Glue the head onto the collar. Coat the bottom of the bead with hot glue. Press it down onto the center of the collar. Hold it until the glue sets. Add a loop to that you can hang your elf. Cut a short piece of 1/16 to 1/8-inch (0.8 and 3.2-millimeters) wide ribbon. Thread the ribbon onto a tapestry needle. Push the needle through the tip of the hat, and pull the ribbon through. Tie the ends of the ribbon together to make a loop. Match the ribbon's color to your elf. Making a Pinecone Elf Find a small pinecone to use as the body of your elf. You will be hanging this on your tree, so the smaller the pinecone, the better. Look for something that is between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) tall. You can leave the pinecone bare for a rustic look, or you can spray paint it first. Wash the pinecone to get rid of any dirt. Let it dry completely. Consider using a scented pinecone from the store. Choose a small, wooden bead to make the head. How big the bead is depends on how big the pinecone is. It needs to be small enough to sit on top of the pinecone. It should also look proportionate to it. Consider painting the bead a flesh tone that suits you. Hot glue the head to the top of the pinecone. If you need to, break off the very tip of the pinecone so that the head can sit nicely on top of it. Make sure that the bead's hole it pointing up. Don't worry about the elf's face just yet. You will be adding that later. Cut a heart shape out of felt. This will eventually make the feet. The heart needs to be about the same width as the pinecone. You can make the feet any color you want. Red and green are the most popular colors, but pastel colors lend this project a rustic charm. Glue the feet to the base of your pinecone. Cover the bottom half of the heart with hot glue. Position the pinecone over the heart, making sure that the top part is sticking out\u2014like feet. Press the pinecone into the glue, and let the glue set. Cut some felt into a triangle. The triangle needs to be wide enough to wrap around the bead you are using for the head, plus extra for a seam. This will make the hat, so you can use any color you want. It can match the feet, or it can be a contrasting color. Sew the edges of the triangle together to make a cone. Fold the triangle in half lengthwise so that slanted edges touch. Stitch them together using a blanket stitch and thread in a contrasting color. Don't turn the hat inside out. The stitching is part of the design. If you can't sew, use hot glue instead. Glue the hat onto the head. Draw a ring of hot glue inside the rim of the hat. Quickly push the hat down onto the elf's head. You can position it right on top of the head, or you can angle it back slightly. For a final touch, consider gluing a small pompom or jingle bell to the tip of the hat. Add a simple face just below the hat. Use two small black dots for the eyes, and a red dot for the mouth. You can use the face using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush or a permanent marker. Cut a narrow strip out of felt to make the scarf. If you'd like, you can cut a small fringe to each end of the scarf. You can make the scarf any color you want, but your elf might look better if the scarf matches the hat or feet. Wrap the scarf around the elf's neck. Tie the scarf in place so that it doesn't fall off. For a more fashionable touch, position the knotted part of the scarf off to the side rather than under the elf's \"chin.\" Cut two mitten shapes out of felt. Start with a heart, then cut one side smaller/shorter than the other. Cut the bottom/pointed part of the heart into a straight edge. You can match the color to the scarf, hat, or feet. Glue the mittens to the sides of the pinecone. Place them more towards the front, and at slight angles. Point the rounded part of the mittens towards the feet, and straight part towards the scarf. Add a loop so that you can hang the elf. Cut a short piece of thin ribbon and thread it onto a tapestry needle. Thread the needle through the top of the hat. Remove the needle, and tie the ends of the ribbon into a loop. The thinner the ribbon, the better. About 1/16 and 1/8-inch (0.8 and 3.2-millimeters) wide would be ideal. For best results, match the ribbon color to the elf's hat, scarf, mittens, or feet.",
