Look for a uniform shape, as opposed to scallops that look shredded and destroyed  These are signs that they have been mishandled. Most are wet-packed, but dry-packed and diver-caught scallops are higher quality. Any of these will work. Avoid using frozen scallops for this recipe. Rinse the scallops. Hold the scallops under cool, running water for a few seconds. Set them on a paper towel. Place another paper towel on top of the scallops and pat them dry. Remove the muscle. Often times, the scallops you purchase will already have the muscle removed. If your scallops still have the muscle attached, pull it off. Grasp it between your thumb and forefinger and tear it away. The muscle is a rectangular tab attached to the body of the scallop. The muscle is tougher than the rest of the scallop, making it less desirable to eat. Wrapping the Scallops Cut the bacon strips in half. Lie the bacon strips on a cutting board. Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut the strips in half so that the strips are half their original length. This way the bacon will wrap around the scallop more evenly with less overlap. Wrap the bacon around the scallop. Place one end of the strip of bacon on the side of the scallop.
