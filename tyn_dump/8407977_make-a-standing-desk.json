Make a note of your overall height, the level of your eyeline and the distance between your hips, elbows and the floor. These rough measurements will come in handy later while working out the specifications for the standing desk that fits your build. No need to break out the tape measure.

Many DIY desk builders recommend starting with pieces like the Gerton table or Viktor shelf from IKEA, then fitting them with customized legs separately.

A person of average height (somewhere between 5\u20197\u201d and 5\u201911\u201d) will likely have the best results with a desk that\u2019s about 3\u2019-4\u2019 tall."

Adjustable desks can be useful if you don\u2019t have enough space for a dedicated standing desk, or you\u2019re not willing to make a permanent commitment just yet. Constructing an adjustable desk will require you to use telescoping legs.
