Before you worry about adding liquid into the centrifuge, confirm that the surface the centrifuge sits on is completely level. A slanted surface will skew results or send the equipment falling to the floor. If you have a carpenter\u2019s level handy, you can confirm that the surface is completely level. Set the level on the tabletop or counter, and make sure that the horizontal bubble is completely centered in its glass tube. If you\u2019re using a very large centrifuge that rests directly on the floor of your lab, you can skip this step."
