Double or triple the recipe if you want to make larger amounts of tea at once. After storing the leftover tea in the refrigerator, pour it into a mug and reheat the beverage in the microwave for at least 30 seconds. Ginger tea tastes best if you drink it within 1 day.

Then, steep a generic black tea bag in the mixture for the specified brewing time on the box. You can also make an easy cup of ginger tea by adding 1\u00bd tsp (3 g) of ground or grated ginger into a mug and pouring in 1.5 cups (350 mL) of boiling water."
