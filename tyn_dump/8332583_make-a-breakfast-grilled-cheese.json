Ideally, the skillet should be large enough to hold two regular-sized slices of bread at a time. Add a tablespoon of butter or canola oil if you wish, or you can simply cook the breakfast meats in their own fat. If the skillet you\u2019re using is not non-stick, lubricating it with a little oil before you start can save you a lot of trouble during the cleanup stage. The liquefied fat from the bacon or sausage can be used to scramble the eggs right afterward."

Turn each strip of bacon over once the liquid fat begins to bubble over the top; if you\u2019re making sausage, make sure to break it into small crumble it as it cooks. Hearty center-cut bacon fries up crisp and meaty, making it perfect for sandwiches. Remove the outer casing from the sausage links before you put them in the pan."

Add salt and pepper to taste. While the skillet is still hot, pour in the eggs and scramble them gently using a flat spatula until they begin to solidify and fluff up. Take the eggs out of the skillet and put them on a separate plate. To cut down on mess and difficulty, keep the eggs in a few large chunks."

It\u2019s best if the cheese is in broad, flat slices, but shredded cheese will work as well. Use 1-2 slices for each sandwich. If you\u2019re really feeling daring, try mixing-and-matching a couple different types of cheese with complementary flavors, such as manchego and swiss. Some cheeses melt better than others.

Pat both halves of the sandwich flat so you\u2019ll be able to put them together neatly. Making a sandwich with two slices of cheese will ensure that it comes out extra rich and hold together better.
