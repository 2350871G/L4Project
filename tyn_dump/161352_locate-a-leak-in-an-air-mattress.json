        "There may be more than one hole or tear contributing to the problem.",
        "Submerging Your Mattress Check the label of your air mattress.",
        "Some manufacturers recommend that you do not submerge their products.",
        "Submerging an air mattress puts it into contact with a lot of water.",
        "Fabric may become saturated.",
        "Once an air mattress is saturated with water, seams may begin to deteriorate.",
        "Protective coating on synthetic fabrics may also begin to separate from the fabric.",
        "Partially inflate the mattress with air.",
        "If it is not at least partially inflated, you you not be able to see air escaping under water.",
        "Fully inflating the mattress may make it very difficult to submerge in a pool or bathtub.",
        "Submerge the valve stem in a pool or bathtub filled with water with the valve closed.",
        "Apply pressure around the valve stem.",
        "See if you can force any air out of the valve.",
        "Escaping air will cause a stream of bubbles to form around the leak.",
        "Look for these around the valve as you apply pressure.",
        "Submerge parts of the fabric under the water.",
        "Look for bubbles, indicating escaping air from a leak.",
        "Do this in sections.",
        "Looking at a smaller area is easier than trying to find leaks in the whole mattress at one time.",
        "Pay close attention to the areas around the seams.",
        "Seams are a common area for holes and tears to occur.",
        "Mark the leak with a permanent marker once you find the source.",
        "Permanent marker is less likely to bleed on a wet surface.",
        "You can partially dry the area around the leak with a towel to aid in marking the leak.",
        "Once the mattress is dry you can make your mark more clear by placing duct tape or a larger mark near the leak.",
        "Dry the mattress in direct sunlight or in the wind for an hour or two.",
        "The seams will take the longest to dry.",
        "If you don't dry a mattress before storing it, mold or mildew can form.",
        "It is important to make sure it is 100% dry before you put it away.",
        "Before you can use any kind of adhesive patch to repair your mattress, it must be 100% dry.",
        "Using the Garden Hose Method Use an outdoor table to do this method.",
        "If your table is wooden, cover it with a blanket, newspapers, or a vinyl tablecloth.",
        "It can be a nuisance to get a wood table too wet.",
        "This method requires the use of a hose and a good deal of water.",
        "You can also use a deck or patio to do this method.",
        "If you are working on a wood surface, make sure it is covered.",
        "Hook up a garden hose and  \"flood\" the area around the valve with water.",
        "Move slowly, as a leak could only be visible for a few seconds.",
        "Concentrating on looking for bubbles where the water is running.",
        "Bubbles escaping around the valve area can indicate there is a leak in the valve.",
        "Inspect the valve to make sure it is sealed properly.",
        "Flood the rest of the surface of the mattress with water.",
        "Use a small stream of water and work slowly.",
        "Concentrate on looking for streams of bubbles escaping from a leak in the mattress.",
        "Look closely around the seams for bubbles.",
        "This indicates escaping air and seams are common sites of tears and holes.",
        "Mark the leak with a permanent marker once you find the source.",
