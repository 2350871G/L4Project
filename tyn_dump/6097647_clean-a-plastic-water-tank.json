To do so, open the outlet valve or tap at the bottom of your tank and let all of the water flow out. Connect a hose to the open valve in order to direct the water to a location where it will not cause any localized flooding or erosion. Permanent water tanks have a washout valve that is located at the base of the tank. If your water tank is permanent and contains a washout valve, use this to drain the tank instead of the regular outlet valve or tap."

To do so, use a bucket to scoop as much water out as possible. Once the water in the bottom is too shallow to scoop with a bucket, use a plastic cup or coffee mug to continue scooping it out."

Move your arm horizontally from side to side while applying a good amount of pressure on the brush or sponge.

This type of brush may be more difficult to maneuver, but will allow you to reach the bottom of the tank safely. If you're using a long-handled brush, you'll probably need to move the brush up and down vertically instead of horizontally. Avoid brushes with steel bristles or sponges made of steel.

Pressure washers come in a variety of sizes and strengths, but one with a pressure range between 1,300 and 2,400 psi works best for most household tasks. Follow these steps to clean the inside of your tank with a power washer:\nFill your power washer with water or cleaning solution. Start by holding it about four feet away from the surface you're cleaning. Move closer until you find the distance that works best for removing dirt, sediment, and debris. Hold the pressure washer so the water hits the interior wall of the tank at a 45 degree angle. Continue this until you are satisfied that you've removed all the dirt and sludge from the walls of your tank. Pressure washers are very powerful, so always wear safety goggles when you're using them, never point them at another person or animal, and follow all other safety regulations.

        "You want to maintain a measurable chlorine reading throughout the entire 24 hour process.",
        "To check this, dip one end of the chlorine strip in the solution and follow the instructions on the packaging to determine how much chlorine is present.",
        "If there is no detectable amount of chlorine, repeat steps two through four.",
        "Drain the tank completely.",
        "Using a hose, drain all of the solution out of your water tank.",
        "Hook the hose up to the valve on the bottom of your tank and allow all of the solution to flow out toward your sewage system.",
        "Make sure you point the hose away from any vegetation, lakes, and any other areas that may be damaged by the chlorine bleach in the mixture.",
        "Do not drain the tank directly into your water distribution system either.",
