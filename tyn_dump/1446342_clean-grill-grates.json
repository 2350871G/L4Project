Deep Cleaning Grill Grates Soak the grates in a vinegar solution. Mix one cup (237 g) of vinegar and two cups (474 g) of baking soda. Pour the solution into a garbage bag or container large enough to fit the grates. Place the grates in the solution and allow them to soak overnight. Place a cover on the container. If you use a garbage bag, fasten it with a rubber band. Remove and rinse the grates. Untie the rubber band or remove the cover from the container. Lift the grates out of the solution. Then, rinse them down with a garden hose. Most of the stuck-on food should fall off. Scrub off any remaining gunk, if necessary. Use a nylon brush for porcelain-coated grates. Move in gentle diagonal strokes. Cast iron or stainless steel grates can handle stainless steel bristles. Move in a gentle vertical direction. Rinse and dry the grates.
