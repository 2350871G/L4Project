        "For example, take it with you to your kids' baseball game, out on your morning jog, and to your friends' barbecue.",
        "Since poodles don't tolerate solitude very well, you should provide them with a distraction toy such as a Kong-type food delivery toy when you must leave them alone.",
        "Otherwise your poodle will act out and keep its mind occupied through other, often destructive behaviors, such as chewing on furniture or shoes.",
        "Use reward-based training methods to teach obedience skills.",
        "Most experts agree that the best way to train a dog is through positive reinforcement\u2014that is, rewarding behaviors you want the dog to do instead of punishing negative ones.",
        "In this approach, you give treats and/or verbal praise when the dog does something good or follows your commands, such as \u201csit,\u201d \u201cstay,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d or come.\u201d  Just make sure that you give the treat and praise within a few seconds of the correct behavior, as otherwise your dog won't understand what they're being rewarded for.",
        "Treats should be small, easily chewed, and healthy, so don't use human foods which get the dog used to salty snacks and can encourage begging.",
        "Using individual kernels of your dog's normal dry food can be a good option.",
        "Visiting the Vet Get your poodle spayed or neutered.",
        "Unless you are a licensed dog breeder equipped with the necessary space and supplies to breed the poodle responsibly, your dog should be spayed or neutered.",
        "Female dogs are best desexed for health and population control reasons.",
        "If you have a male dog, talk to the vet about the pros and cons of neutering.",
        "Vaccinate your poodle.",
        "You should make sure to get your poodle the rabies, distemper, parvovirus, and adenovirus vaccines at the very least.",
        "You can also get a flu shot and other preventative shots for your poodle, but these are not strictly essential according to veterinary guidelines.",
        "For example, if you live in areas with high populations of rattlesnakes or ticks, you might want to consider getting special vaccinations against rattlesnake venom or lyme disease.",
        "Provide preventative treatments.",
        "Part of being a responsible owner includes making sure your dog receives regular treatments to prevent health problems.",
        "Your vet can provide medicine to prevent heartworms, fleas, ticks, and internal worms.",
        "Be aware of poodle-specific health problems.",
        "There are some diseases and conditions, such as Addison's and Cushing's disease, which affect poodles more than they do other breeds, so you should know what to look for and how to prevent developing problems.",
        "Symptoms like itchiness, dry skin, or abnormal bumps call for a visit to the vet, while more serious symptoms such as difficult urination, distended abdomen, discolored gums, or cloudy eyes warrant a more urgent trip to the emergency clinic.",
        "You should also watch out for symptoms of allergies.",
        "Poodles are not a breed particularly prone to food allergies, but keep an eye out for any symptoms such as itchy skin, excessive licking, or ear infections.",
        "If you notice any of these problems, visit your local veterinary office and see if they think food could be the cause of your dog's allergy.",
        "Get yearly check-ups and blood screens.",
        "In addition to staying current on your dog's vaccines, you should take it to the vet every year for a standard check-up and blood tests.",
        "These tests will indicate any newly developing infections or diseases, and early detection of serious conditions like Addison's will greatly improve your dog's chances of recovery and life expectancy.",
        "Be proactive about your dog's health by asking your vet some questions whenever you see them.",
        "For example, ask if your poodle's weight is within prescribed guidelines, if you should see a specialist about any ongoing problems, or if your dog should get a professional dental cleaning.",
        "You also might want to consider purchasing health insurance for your poodle.",
        "While poodles are known as generally healthy dogs, veterinary costs can add up quickly if your poodle contracts a disease or has an accident.",
        "Ask your vet what they think about it and explore policy options online."
