If any of the skin starts peeling away when you remove the root, use your fingers to peel off as much as possible. At this point, you do not need to worry about removing any skin that does not lift off the onion on its own. Note the difference between the root end and the stem end. The stem end will be marked with a cluster of thin, paper-like skin extending past the top of the onion. The root end will have a thick root that is visible above the skin layer of the onion. For this method and this step, you only need to remove the root end."
