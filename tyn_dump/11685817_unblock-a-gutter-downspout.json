Move the bottom 1 foot (30 cm) away from your home for every 4 feet (1.2 m) of vertical height. Lean the ladder against your home and maintain 3 points of contact while climbing, such as 2 hands and 1 foot. For example, if you need to climb 16 feet (490 cm), place the ladder 4 feet (120 cm) away from the building. Avoid climbing on your roof to access your gutters since you\u2019re more likely to slip and fall. Never stop on the top rung of a ladder since you could easily lose your balance."

Avoid spraying the hose from the top hole of the downspout since you may cause the clog to compact more. If you have low water pressure, the hose may not remove the clog. Snaking the Downspout with an Auger Insert the end of a drum auger into the bottom of your downspout. Pull the metal end, which usually has a ball or claw shape, out from the cylindrical drum of the auger so you have about 2\u20133 feet (61\u201391 cm) of line.
