                    "description": "Because gemstones can vary in cost, learn to cut and facet less expensive gems. For example, work with fluorite before moving on to more expensive gems such as emeralds or garnets. For less expensive gems, start with quartz, fluorite, crystal, beryl, and tourmaline. If you're ready to work with semi-precious and precious gems, try sapphires, zircon, garnets, amethysts, and opals."

        "Kennon Young\t\t\tMaster Gemologist Appraiser\t\t\t\tThe shape of the gem might be based on the shape of the crystal before it is cut, any inclusions you might want to add, and your price range.",
        "Cutting Hard Gems with a Faceting Machine Use a faceting machine to preform the gem.",
        "Most uncut gems are oddly shaped so you may need to grind it down.",
        "Roughly grinding the outsides of the gem will make it closer to the size and shape you want.",
        "Hold the gem between your fingertips and carefully polish it on a 1200 grit lap.",
        "If you have a lot of rough to remove, use a 260 grit lap.",
        "Since faceting machines are expensive and not usually available for rent, see if you can take a few faceting classes to become familiar with using them.",
        "If you want to buy one, find one directly from a manufacturer or look online.",
        "Secure the rough gem to a dop stick using warm wax.",
        "Heat a dime-sized amount of dop wax on the end of your dop stick.",
        "Hold it near a flame so the wax softens and becomes pliable.",
        "Stick the base of the gem that will be mounted into the wax.",
        "The faced surface of the gem should be exposed.",
        "Let the wax cool before you grind it so the gem stays on the dop stick.",
        "Once you've gained experience, consider using superglue or cyanoacrylate adhesives instead of wax.",
        "These are less likely to break off or damage heat-sensitive gems such as opals.",
        "Grind the outlines of the stone to shape the girdle.",
        "Use a 1200 lap disc on your faceting machine to cut the circumference (girdle) of the gem.",
        "Set the angle to 90 degrees so you can make symmetrical cuts.",
        "Don't lock the index wheel on the machine so you can move it freely and have more control over cutting.",
        "The outline you cut will depend on which shape you've chosen.",
        "For example, you'll make a rectangular girdle for an emerald cut.",
        "Consult the machine's instruction manual for specific instructions about each style of cut.",
        "Wipe grit from the gem and put a pre-polishing lap on the machine.",
        "Wipe the gem clean with a microfiber cloth.",
        "This will remove the coarser grit that's transferred to the gem.",
        "Take the coarser lap disc off of the machine and put a pre-polishing lap on the machine.",
        "Cut the facets according to the shape you want.",
        "Find faceting diagrams for the shape you're cutting the gem.",
        "A diagram will tell you how many facets to make and at what angles to make them.",
        "Polish the facets against the lap until the surfaces of the gem are smooth.",
        "To get the cut you want, you may have to reheat the dop wax, remove the rough, and reposition it in the hot wax.",
        "Heating the stone along with the wax will not harm it.",

        "As the machine gets toward the middle of the facet, it polishes the stone at the same time.",
        "Charge the polishing lap with an oxide polish.",
        "Put a polishing lap on your machine.",
        "Take the small spatula that came with your oxide polish and dip it into the polish so a peanut-sized amount is on the end of the spatula.",
        "Run the machine and spread the polish over the lap in a smooth even layer.",
        "Polish the top of the cut gem against the polishing lap.",
        "This will buff your new gemstone until it sparkles and will help remove any grit or imperfections leftover by the faceting process.",
        "To remove the finished stone from the dop stick, warm the wax near an open flame so it softens.",
        "Then pull the stone away from the wax.",
        "Cutting Soft Gems by Hand Select a softer gem for cutting without a machine.",
        "While you can cut harder gems, they'll take more time and effort to cut.",
        "Instead, choose gems that are lower on the Mohs hardness scale.",
        "For example, these softer stones will cut easily:\nFluorite\nMalachite\nCoral\nPearl\nAmber Lay the 180 grit sandpaper and cutting board on a cloth.",
        "To make a stable work surface, lay a cloth down.",
        "Set a cutting board on the cloth so the board doesn't slide around.",
        "Place a sheet of 180 grit sandpaper on the cutting board so the rough side faces up.",
        "Pour 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of water on the sandpaper.",
        "Pour the water directly on the center of the sandpaper.",

        "Once you've finished using the coarsest sandpaper, run a little water over the gem to rinse it of the grit.",
        "Remove the 180 grit sandpaper from the cutting board and lay down a piece of 400 grit sandpaper.",
        "Pour 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of water in the center of the sandpaper.",
        "Rub each facet of the gem over the 400 grit sandpaper.",

        "Remove the sandpaper and set down a sheet of 600 grit sandpaper.",
        "Pour 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of water onto the center of the sandpaper and rub each of the gem's facets across it.",
        "Remember to rinse the gem once you've finished with the 600 grit sandpaper.",
        "Finish rubbing the gem over 1200 grit sandpaper.",
        "Replace the 600 grit sandpaper with a sheet of 1200 grit sandpaper.",
        "Pour 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of water onto the center of the 1200 grit sandpaper.",
        "Rub each facet of the gem back and forth across the sandpaper a few times.",
        "By now, the gem should be completely smooth on every side.",
        "Wrap the cutting board with cloth and rinse the stone.",
        "Remove the 1200 grit sandpaper from the cutting board.",
        "Lay another cloth over the cutting board and tuck the ends under the bottom of the cutting board.",

        "Put metal polish on the cloth and rub each facet of the stone against it.",
        "Squirt a dime-sized amount of liquid metal polish on the cloth that's over the cutting board.",
        "Take the dry gem and rub it vigorously through the polish on the cloth.",
        "Turn the gem and rub it again so that each facet becomes polished.",
        "If you're having a hard time seeing if the gem is polished enough, rinse it occasionally and dry it before rubbing it over the metal polish again.",
        "Rinse and dry the finished gem.",
        "Run clean water over the gem to remove excess metal polish.",
        "Rub the gem dry with a clean cloth and examine it to see if it's as smooth as you like.",
        "Each facet of the gem should be smooth and shiny if you've polished it enough.",
        "If it still looks rough in spots, you can rub it over wet sandpaper again.",
