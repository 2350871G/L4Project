Brace the roast firmly and trim fat from the sides of the meat with a sharp cutting knife. Rub the meat with a pinch of salt and pepper. Brown the sides of the meat in a Dutch oven. Coat the bottom of a large Dutch oven with 2\u20133 tablespoons (30\u201344 ml) of olive oil or vegetable oil. Place the meat in the pan and warm it over medium heat. Brown the meat for 2-3 minutes on each side. Turn the meat with metal tongs to avoid getting a burn. Drain the excess fat. Put on oven mitts to pick up the hot pan. Drain the fat from the Dutch oven by pouring it out into a sturdy container. Discard the liquid in the garbage. Add beef broth, celery, and onion to the pan. Pour 1 can of beef broth into the pan. Add 1 large, chopped onion and 2 diced celery stalks. Stir the vegetables into the broth. Cover the pan and roast the meat for about 75 minutes. Place the lid on the Dutch oven. Put it in the oven and let the meat cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. If your pan doesn't have a lid, cover it with thick aluminum foil instead. Remove the celery and onion and add other vegetables to the pan. Remove the pan from the oven and take off the lid. Use a slotted spoon to remove the celery and onion pieces from the pan. Replace the celery with up to 5 cups (approximately 750 g) of other vegetables, such as diced potatoes, sweet potatoes, or carrots. Roast the meat uncovered for 50-60 minutes. Place the pan back into the oven, uncovered. Let it bake for about an hour. Spoon juices over the roast every 10-20 minutes to keep it moist and flavorful. Transfer the roast and vegetables to a large plate to serve. Use metal tongs and a slotted spoon to remove the meat and vegetables from the Dutch oven. Place them on a large serving plate. Use a large knife to cut pieces of the roast to serve. Use a digital thermometer to check the internal temperature of the roast, which should be at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Broiling a Steak in the Oven Let the raw steak stand for 30 minutes to bring up the temperature. Cold meat will not cook as well in the oven as meat at room temperature. Remove your steak from the fridge and place it on the kitchen counter. Let it sit for half an hour. Opt for a thicker steak like rib eye, T-bone, or filet mignon to bake. Season the steak with oil, salt, and pepper. Add a few drops of olive oil or vegetable oil to the top of your steak. Rub the oil over the surface of your steak with your fingers. Shake salt and pepper onto the steak and coat it entirely. Heat a skillet in your oven under the broiler for 20 minutes. Place a medium-size skillet pan in the oven. Turn on your oven's broiler element. Position the pan directly under the broiler. Place the skillet pan about 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) below the broiler element for the best results. You can move the oven racks if necessary. Make sure your skillet is cast iron or another oven-safe material. Transfer the skillet from the oven to the stove. Turn one of your stove burners to high heat. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer it to the heated burner. Use an oven glove to handle the hot skillet safely. Sear each side of the steak for 30 seconds. Use metal tongs to place the steak on the hot pan. Count to 30, then flip the meat and count to 30 again. Place the skillet back in the oven for 2 minutes. Place the skillet with the steak still in it into the oven. Close the oven door and let the meat sit under the broiler for 2 minutes. Remove the pan, flip the steak, and cook it for another 2 minutes. Take the skillet pan out of the oven. Use the tongs to flip the steak. Place the steak back in the oven and broil it for another 2 minutes. This timing will cook your steak to medium-rare. For a medium steak, broil it for an extra 2 minutes, or more for a drier, well-done steak. The internal temperature of the steak should be at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Roasting Beef Brisket Preheat the oven to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C) and prepare the brisket sauce. In a small bowl, add 0.75 cups (180 ml) of your favorite barbecue sauce, 0.25 cups (59 ml) of soy sauce, and 1 cup (240 ml) of water. Stir the ingredients with a spoon to mix them. Place the beef brisket on a large piece of aluminum foil and coat it with the sauce. Lay a 3\u20134 lb (1.4\u20131.8 kg) piece of brisket cut beef on a large piece of aluminum foil. Pour the sauce over the meat to coat it. Use a spoon to make sure the entire surface of the meat is covered. Brisket cuts of beef are usually taken from the breast or lower chest. Wrap up the aluminum foil and place the brisket in a roasting pan. Lift the edges of the aluminum foil and fold them over to wrap up the brisket. Make sure that the meat is entirely covered to prevent it from drying out while cooking. Place the brisket in the center of a large roasting pan. Roast the brisket in the oven for 3-4 hours. Place the roasting pan in the oven. Cook the meat for 1 hour per 1 pound (0.45 kg). Let the meat rest for 30 minutes before serving it. Remove the brisket from the oven and wait a half hour before opening the aluminum foil package to avoid getting burned. When it is done, the internal temperature of the brisket should reach at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Serve the brisket with potatoes, vegetables, or another side dish of your choice.",
