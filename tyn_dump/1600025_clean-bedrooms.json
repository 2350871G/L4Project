Remember that items like air fresheners cover up old smells rather than eliminate them. Musty smells from water and mildew, for example, need to be treated separately with thorough cleaning.

Retrieve the old sheets when you\u2019re done washing them or get a fresh set of linens. Tuck a fitted sheet over your mattress, cover it with a top sheet, then return comforters and blankets to the bed. Finish by putting the pillows back into place. Fluff up the pillows after stuffing them into pillowcases. Arrange them so your bed looks nice and neat. Dusting and Polishing Furniture Pull items off of bookshelves and nightstands for dusting. Take everything off of your furniture. That includes lamps, books, and all the collectibles lining your bureaus. Wipe off your furniture with a dry or slightly dampened rag to eliminate any gathered dust. Rearrange your items when you\u2019re done to make your room look neat. Consider decluttering by moving or getting rid of things you no longer need. If you have a computer in your room, wipe off the screen with a microfiber cloth and glass cleaner. Blow debris out with compressed air to keep your computer running optimally. Pull lampshades off of your lights to clean them. Most lamp shades are fabric cylinders that slide off when you pull up on them. Go over them with a lint roller or brush to remove dust and hair. While you have the lampshades off, wipe down the lamps and bulbs with a dry cloth or duster. You don\u2019t need to unplug the lamps while cleaning them, but make sure they are turned off. Hot bulbs aren\u2019t fun to touch. Make sure the bulbs are dry before turning them back on. Scrub off mildew and dust bunnies inside the furniture. Look inside drawers and along walls and shelves for signs of mildew and debris. If you notice unpleasant green or black spots spreading, get a commercial mold and mildew remover to eliminate all that nasty growth trying to invade your personal space. Scrubbing the spots with vinegar or bleach diluted in water also helps. Wash off any remaining dust as well. Moisture leads to mildew, so don\u2019t use water or liquid cleaners in enclosed spaces if you can help it. If you don\u2019t have mildew, clear out drawers and other areas with a dry cloth or a vacuum cleaner. Reach under furniture to clear out the space underneath it. Kneel down and take a peek to find out what has fallen behind your furniture. Slide a broom underneath dressers and into other spaces to retrieve items. Make use of a vacuum or hose attachment to clear out dust and debris. Move smaller pieces away from walls so you are better able to reach behind them. You will probably find lots of nice dust bunnies there to escort out of your space! Remove storage boxes underneath furniture. Look through them to determine if you still need them in your room. Clean them off as needed before putting them back in place. Brighten furniture with a clean cloth and polish. Wipe down desks, dressers, nightstands, and other areas. Get rid of as much dust as possible, especially along flat surfaces. Go back over these surfaces with a damp cloth to remove the remaining debris. Then, scrub wood furniture with a wood polish to make your furniture shine. Note any signs of damages, including loose handles and broken hinges. These require a little extra work to fix. Repair them as soon as possible. Cleaning the Floor Take rugs outside to beat them free of dust. Vacuum them like you\u2019re cleaning regular carpeting to take care of most of the dust and debris. Then, let rugs air out outside of your bedroom. Shake the rugs to loosen remaining debris and leave it behind where it belongs. Return your rugs indoors when you\u2019re done. Don\u2019t let rugs get wet. Also, leaving a rug exposed to sunlight for too long may damage it. Some smaller rugs can be cleaned in a washing machine. Check the manufacturer\u2019s tag to make sure it\u2019s safe. If it isn\u2019t, treat spots with a commercial rug cleaner or visit a dry cleaner. Vacuum the floor if your bedroom has carpeting. Run a vacuum over carpeting to remove debris lodged in it. Use a steam vacuum to tackle soiled areas prone to foot traffic, such as near the doorway. Then, spot treat remaining stains as needed to get the carpeting back into a good condition. To spot treat carpeting, try vinegar or a commercial carpet cleaner. Old stains are hard to remove, so always treat stains as they form to prevent them from setting in. Dust and mop hard flooring to clean it. For wood and tile floors, dry mopping is usually enough. Go back over the floor with a wet mop to remove remaining debris. If you need to give the floor a deeper cleaning, get a liquid cleaner matching the type of floor you have. It's best to vacuum your hard floors with a soft brush attachment before you mop. The vacuum cleaner will quickly and easily remove any dirt or debris, instead of pushing it around like a mop can. For example, mix a few drops of liquid dish soap in a bucket of warm water. Use the soapy water to scrub tile or polyurethane wood floors. For wood floors sealed with shellac or varnish, get a wood floor cleaner or polish. Use a wax mop to scrub the floor in the direction of the wood\u2019s grain. Place something fragrant in your room to eliminate floor odors. The worst odors often come from the floor, especially carpeting. Perhaps you\u2019re lucky enough to have a nice vase of roses to set out on your desk. If you don\u2019t, spray a spritz of room spray or plug in an air freshener. Sweet-smelling herbs, incense, or candles also help put the finishing touches on your beautiful bedroom. Remember that items like air fresheners cover up old smells rather than eliminate them. Musty smells from water and mildew, for example, need to be treated separately with thorough cleaning. Be careful when lighting candles or other fragrances. Don\u2019t leave anything burning unattended, and make sure the scent is acceptable to anyone else you live with.",
