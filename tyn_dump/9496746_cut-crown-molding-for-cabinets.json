    "text": " Measuring Your Cabinet Use a tape measure to find the length from one cabinet side to the next. Place the tape measure flush against each area you will add crown molding to. Measure as precisely as possible so you don't cut pieces that are too long or short. Use a sliding bevel to find the angle of outside corners. Place the inside edge of your bevel's tightening nut on the corner of your cabinet. Adjust the handle and blade so they are flush against each cabinet side. Tighten the nut on your bevel to hold the measurement in place. You will use a protractor to find the exact degree of this angle. Measure the angle of inside corners with a sliding bevel. Place the handle of your bevel flush against one of the angle's connecting sides. Adjust the bevel's blade until it is flush with the other side. Make sure the device's tightening nut is nestled in the angle itself, then screw it to secure the measurement. You will use a protractor to convert this angle into a specific degree. Though most free-standing cabinets will not have inside corners, this method is useful for wall-mounted and t-shaped cabinets. Use a protractor to find the degree of each angle. After measuring a corner, place the handle of your bevel flush against a piece of paper. Using a pencil, draw a line along the blade of the device. Replace the bevel with your protractor to find the exact angles of your cabinet and any wall-mounted corners. Most cabinet angles will be about 90 degrees, but measuring precisely will help you avoid ugly gaps and askew seams. Cutting Straight Pieces Measure a piece of crown molding equal to the length of the cabinet. Place your tape measure on the edge of the crown and extend it to the length of one cabinet side. Use a pencil to mark the exact spot that needs to be cut. Repeat for each cabinet side. If your crown is too short to cover the length of a side, you can combine two straight pieces together using a thin layer of glue. This is known as a scarf joint. Set your saw to a desired angle. If the edge of your piece will sit flush against a wall or frame, a straight 90\u00b0 cut will work fine.
