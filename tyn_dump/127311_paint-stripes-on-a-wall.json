To make your ceilings look taller, go for vertical stripes that reach the top of the wall. If there are fixtures on the wall, like lights or windows, remember that they will interrupt the stripes and can lessen the visual effect. Don\u2019t be afraid to get creative when it comes to picking a pattern. You can even do diagonal stripes for an interesting and eye-catching design.

                    "description": "Once you decide on a design, choose a color scheme for the stripes. Opt for monochromatic warm tones, like red, orange, yellow, brown, cream, or tan, for an inviting and cozy space. If you want to make a bolder statement, go for cool, contrasting shades, like blue, purple, black, white, or silver. If you\u2019re having trouble figuring out your shades, consult a color wheel for assistance, or look at photos of striped walls online for some inspiration. Types of Color Schemes\nMonochromatic schemes are similar tonal combinations that use several shades of a single color for a subtle effect. For example, if you use a very light pink, slighly light pink, and just regular pink, then you're using a monochromatic scheme. Analogous schemes combine colors that are similar in tone and feel, but are not the same hue, like green, yellow, and orange. Contrast schemes are composed of colors dissimilar in hue from each other, like white, red, and black. Complementary schemes use two hues opposite one another on the color wheel for intense variation, such as blue and orange."

        "Rollers create a smoother, fuller finish than paint brushes.",
        "Let the walls dry overnight and peel off the tape.",
        "After applying the 2nd coat of paint, allow the stripes to dry almost completely.",
        "When the paint is still slightly wet, lift one end of the tape, and pull off the tape at a 45-degree angle from the wall.",
        "Work smoothly and quickly to avoid pulling off the paint or chipping the base.",
        "If you pull off the tape when the paint is completely dry, you risk chipping or peeling the stripes.",
        "If you do have some chips or peeling, wait until the paint is dry and then use a small paintbrush to touch up the color as much as possible.",
        "You may need to re-apply the tape to get a crisp line for your stripes when doing touch-ups."
